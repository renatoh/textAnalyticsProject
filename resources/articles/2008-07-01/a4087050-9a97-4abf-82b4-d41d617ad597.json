To bring your interview up to the present day, Space is celebrating 40 years with a selling exhibition of work by 55 current Space artists, including this year's Turner prize winner, Mark Wallinger. The interview rightly says that Space is still going strong, but we are constantly at risk as leases come up for renewal and we are exposed to the property market of east London, where former factory buildings are in high demand for loft conversions and the 2012 Olympics further affect affordability of property. To support our affordable studios, which currently benefit 600 artists, and education and training programmes, which benefit 11,000 local community members each year, Caroline Douglas, head of the Arts Council Collection, made the selections for the Space Now exhibition by visiting all 600 of our current artists. A percentage of the sales proceeds from the show will go towards future studio developments. We are reliant on fundraising and the generosity of supporters to continue with our studio provision. The Space Now exhibition runs until July 26 at Space, 129-131 Mare Street, London E8, Monday-Friday 10am-5pm, Saturday 12-4pm.
