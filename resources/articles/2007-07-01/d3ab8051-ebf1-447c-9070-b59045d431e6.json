The former government communications director is identified with the spin-over-substance approach which the new prime minister has spent his first days in office defining himself against. Other courtiers at No 10 could be just as influential, but Mr Campbell's continuous contact with journalists ensured that he developed the most extraordinary profile. His re-emergence thus draws extra attention to Mr Brown's early moves to withdraw the power of political advisers over officials and to ensure that policies are discussed in parliament before the press. The less-than-wholesome symbiosis between politics and journalism is bigger than any one man. It did not start with Mr Campbell - Joe Haines and Bernard Ingham did similar jobs controversially many years before. Nor will it end with the retirement of Tony Blair. Spin is not confined to one party, as was seen yesterday with the arrival in post of a new Conservative communications chief, Andy Coulson, who, like Mr Campbell, has a background in tabloid journalism. Even Mr Brown's attempts to restore more traditional ways of working have been designed with an eye to how they will play in the media. It could hardly be otherwise. Until the public starts tuning into BBC Parliament channel in large numbers, politicians will depend on broadcasters and newspapers to reach the voters on whom their power depends. But Mr Campbell, who has no time for free-thinking journalists, took manipulation to new heights. His tactics were all the more effective - at least in the short term - because he worked for a government whose initial popularity led some journalists to suspend their scepticism. That was not healthy, but nor is the current mood of outright cynicism that Alastair Campbell's spinning eventually helped to engender. The unreflective tone of The Blair Years does not detract from the lively anecdotes, but what of its value to history? Since Richard Crossman's deathbed battle to publish his journal detailing life inside the 1960s Wilson government, political diaries have offered an invaluable bypass around the 30-year rule restricting official papers which were previously the only contemporary written record. After Crossman came Tony Benn and Barbara Castle, before Alan Clark mixed indiscretion with bad behaviour to propel the genre into the bestseller list. Inherently subjective and yet afforded a special authenticity, political diarists infuriate non-scribbling colleagues who never get quite the same chance to put across their side of the story. Even the best diaries bear a health-warning for partiality. But they have real value too, for recording life as lived each day, not as it seems to historians or to reminiscing elder statesmen. The desire to control the impact of The Blair Years, though, has robbed it of that property. Campbell's writing seems contemporary, but his plan was always for publication of the book (which he has reportedly long referred to as his \"pension\"). That may have affected what he recorded. Even if it did not, by his own admission, he self-censored during editing, to protect the Labour government. It seems also, though he has been less clear on this, that he has been careful to protect the lobby journalists with whom he worked most closely, several of whom get only passing references in the book. That leaves him shedding less light than he might have on the interface between politics and media. Then there is the doubt about how far the book was shaped by the need to protect the author himself. When it comes to the plagiarised February 2003 dossier on Iraq - which even Jack Straw described as a \"horlicks\", and publicly blamed Campbell for - the diaries describe the row that came afterwards, but have little to say on how it was put together. Maybe he did not think that was interesting. But maybe, four years after he left his post, Alastair Campbell is still spinning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
