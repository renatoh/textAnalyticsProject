Speaking after a call with state governors on Thursday, Biden said he was not concerned that Trump\u2019s refusal to concede the election would prevent a transfer of power, but said it \u201csends a horrible message about who we are as a country\u201d. \u201cWhat the president\u2019s doing now \u2026 it\u2019s going to be another incident where he will go down in history as being one of the most irresponsible presidents in American history,\u201d Biden told reporters in Wilmington. \u201cIt\u2019s just not within the norm at all, and there\u2019s a question as to whether it\u2019s even legal.\u201d Americans are \u201cwitnessing incredible irresponsibility, incredibly damaging messages being sent to the rest of the world about how democracy functions,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t know his motive, but I just think it\u2019s totally irresponsible.\u201d Trump has launched legal challenges in multiple states and claimed, without evidence, that he is the rightful winner of the election. His administration has refused to recognize Biden as the likely winner, blocking Biden\u2019s transition team from funding and office space and the president-elect from receiving classified briefings. The Trump campaign has so far filed at least nine lawsuits challenging the election and its results, many of which legal experts have dismissed as weak. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, told a news conference earlier on Thursday that he planned to file more lawsuits and that Democrats had engaged in a \u201cnational conspiracy\u201d to manipulate vote totals, though he admitted he had no evidence. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to set up the conditions where half of the country believes that there are only two possibilities, either they win or the election was stolen,\u201d said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law scholar and professor at Loyola Law School. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not a democracy.\u201d In Michigan, Trump has mounted an all-out assault on the election result, reportedly planning to fly state lawmakers to meet with him in Washington on Friday after phoning county officials in an apparent attempt to derail the certification of Biden\u2019s 150,000-vote victory in the state. While no explanation for the meeting has been given, Trump has been pressuring Republican state lawmakers to try to hijack the electoral college by advancing slates of electors that could compete with those selected by the states\u2019 voters. On Tuesday night, Trump placed phone calls to two Republican members of a county-level vote certification board the night before the pair tried to reverse their previous endorsement of a large chunk of the vote in Michigan. Trump\u2019s own election security agency has declared the 2020 presidential election to have been the most secure in history. Days after that statement was issued, Trump fired the agency\u2019s leader. Biden said the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to give his team access to key federal agencies was affecting their ability to create a plan to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, particularly around vaccine distribution. Biden referenced the refusal by the General Services Administration (GSA) to name him the apparent winner of the election. The refusal has blocked Biden\u2019s team from receiving federal funds allocated for the transition and barred his team from meeting with their counterparts to collect relevant information. Biden said his transition team doesn\u2019t have \u201call the information that we need to get from all the various agencies,\u201d and that, as a result, \u201cwe\u2019re not able to deal with everything from testing to guidance to the all-important issue of vaccine distribution.\u201d Biden has launched his own working group focused on crafting an actionable plan to rein in the pandemic. But he and his aides have said a lack of access to the current planning in the federal government will make the response much more difficult when Biden does take office in January. Biden pledged he would not pursue a nationwide shutdown after his inauguration in January, despite the recent surge in coronavirus cases. More than 250,000 people in the US have died after contracting coronavirus and millions have been infected, far more than in any other country. \u201cNo national shutdown,\u201d the president-elect told reporters. \u201cI am not going to shut down the economy. I am going to shut down the virus.\u201d Biden said he had discussed a possible nationwide mask mandate with state governors during a call, as Covid-19 case and death rates rise across the United States. Biden said wearing a mask was \u201cnot a political statement, it\u2019s a patriotic duty\u201d during remarks after the call with both Republican and Democratic state governors. Later on Thursday, Dr Anthony Fauci, one of the nation\u2019s top epidemiologists, spoke during the first White House coronavirus taskforce briefing in months. Led by vice-president Mike Pence, the briefing touted recent developments in coronavirus vaccine candidates. Fauci celebrated positive news about the Pfizer and Moderna coronavirus vaccine candidates, but emphasized the need to remain vigilant about social-distancing and mask usage. \u201cIf you\u2019re fighting a battle and the cavalry is on the way, you don\u2019t stop shooting,\u201d Fauci added. \u201cYou keep going until the cavalry gets here, and then you might even want to continue fighting.\u201d Instead, Fauci said Americans needed to \u201cdouble down on the public health measures as we\u2019re waiting for that help to come, which will be soon.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about shutting down the country. We\u2019re not talking about locking down. We\u2019re talking about intensifying the simple public health measures that we all talk about,\u201d Fauci said. While several top US health experts appeared at the briefing, Trump did not - a departure from the summer\u2019s briefings, when the president would often largely deliver wide-ranging briefings himself.
