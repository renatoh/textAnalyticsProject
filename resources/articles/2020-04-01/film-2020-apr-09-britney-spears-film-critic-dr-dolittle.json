On a practical scale, schedules have been wiped and income reduced to zero. But psychologically, it also means that the planet\u2019s biggest extroverts have been robbed of an outlet. They have all this pent-up desire for approval, and nowhere to put it. Until now, this has largely manifested itself in slightly cringey iPhone videos uploaded to the internet. But now Britney Spears, that bold pioneer, has opened up a whole new avenue of quarantined expression. That\u2019s right, she has become a film reviewer. The first fruits of Britney\u2019s side-hustle appeared last night, as she posted her review of the Robert Downey Jr film Dolittle on Instagram. It reads: This movie is a must see !!! @RobertDowneyJr is so genuine you fall in love with him \u2026 the animal characters are hilarious and there seems to be a Special Tone throughout the whole movie which I find hard to find these days \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude18. So if you watch this movie and you\u2019re as enamored as I was with his jackets and clothing \u2026 don\u2019t get lost like I did \ud83d\ude02 just remember he\u2019s a man who can speak to animals and he\u2019s brilliant \ud83e\udd9c\ud83d\udc33\ud83e\udd81\ud83d\udc37\ud83d\udc3b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83d\udc95 !!!!! Pss \u2026 how long has it been since you\u2019ve seen what you\u2019ve wanted to see \u2026 I can\u2019t even count how many movies I\u2019ve watched in this quarantine so far \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 !!!!!\u201d Now, it\u2019s easy to mock Spears for this. The capitalisation of \u201cSpecial Tone\u201d. The term \u201cI find hard to find\u201d. The implication that the plot was slightly too complex for her. The fact that she is posting a critical rave for a film that not only contains a climactic scene where Robert Downey Jr frantically pulls a bagpipe from a dragon\u2019s bum, but is currently on schedule to be the biggest commercial flop of the year. After all, Britney\u2019s assessment of the film is quite the outlier. Compare her Dolittle rave with the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw review, which called the film \u201chorribly inert\u201d. Or Empire, which deemed it \u201clacklustre\u201d. Or Total Film, which described it as \u201clifeless and dead-eyed\u201d. Or NPR, who decided it was less a film and more \u201ca crime scene in need of forensic analysis\u201d. Perhaps Britney was expecting less of Dolittle. Perhaps she uses a different set of criteria to evaluate cinema. Perhaps she watched the wrong film by accident. We may never know. However, take a look at Rotten Tomatoes and you\u2019ll find that her view is much more closely aligned to the public than the critics. The professionals gave Dolittle a miserable 15%. The general public, on the other hand, awarded it a mighty 76%. And Britney\u2019s post \u2013 essentially \u201cnice animals, good clothes, bit confusing in places\u201d \u2013 reads exactly like a 76% review. In layman\u2019s terms, this means that Spears has her finger on the pulse of public opinion. She understands what we want, and she always has, because she is one of us. And, don\u2019t forget, Dolittle is a flop. Far fewer people went to see it than anticipated, so there\u2019s a real chance that Spears\u2019 praise will inspire hundreds of thousands to seek it out. It might even dig the film out of the mire a little. For a successful actor such as Spears (no, really; her 2002 film Crossroads made its budget back five times over, making it a much hotter commercial property than Dolittle) to reach down and help an underdog like this shows a lot of class. Now we just have to sit back and wait to see what she reviews next. Will she continue to buck the critical trend, by slagging off Uncut Gems or embracing Playmobil: The Movie? Will she maintain her dedication to focusing on underperforming releases, by reviewing UglyDolls or The Goldfinch? How on earth will she use emojis to convey the Special Tone of Colour Out of Space or The Hunt? Either way, she has to review more films. Her public demands it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
