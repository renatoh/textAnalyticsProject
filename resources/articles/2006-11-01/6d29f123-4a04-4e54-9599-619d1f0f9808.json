But that may, we concede, have appeared frivolous, so we begin instead with internet how-to manual Wikihow's potentially vital advice on How To Regain Control Of A Spooked Camel. \"First, stay calm,\" it admonishes. Second, \"Hang on to the reins, often attached to a peg in the nose.\" Third, \"Consider a quick dismount. Kick out of the stirrups, and try to hit the ground running. Note that this should not be attempted at high speed, unless there is impending danger ahead (eg, a cliff).\" And if all else fails, \"Hold on. The camel will eventually stop.\" You may laugh, but one day you'll thank us. \u00b7 Our coveted Criminal Mastermind of the Month Award, meanwhile, goes to fugitive double-homicide suspect Calvin Bennett, 26, who, after featuring extensively on US Crimewatch equivalent America's Most Wanted, posted his name, address and photograph on an an internet dating site and was, according to Arkansas police, arrested within a matter of hours. \u00b7 Tariq Ali's excellent new work on Evo Morales, Fidel Castro and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez is, cunningly, called Pirates of the Caribbean. Its cover features pics of the three Latin American swashbucklers against a stirring background of palm trees and pirate ships, with, intriguingly, Fidel (and Fidel alone) sporting a halo. How so, the author was asked at the launch party in London the other night. Aha, said he: the Comandante's health scare this summer worried the publishers so much that they feared he might croak while the jacket was being printed. Simple, really. \u00b7 We are indebted to the website of Liverpool council for the news that the city's marketing services department invites suitably qualified organisations to tender for the production of a short film with the promising working title Feral Pigeon Reduction In The City Centre. Next summer's surprise Merseyside smash, we'll wager. \u00b7 But perhaps pigeons are the new squirrels. For animal terrorism, it seems, is on the march. In Bradford, the Telegraph &amp; Argus reports, a determined assault by what may well prove merely an advance party of mice has driven the Fitton family from their Thompson Avenue home, months after the Regan family of Averingcliffe Road were \"terrorised\" by marauding squirrels. In Russia, meanwhile, Komsomolskaya Pravda reports that last winter, in a remote village in the far east, \"Squirrels bit to death a dog that was barking at them, then scampered off, some carrying scraps of flesh.\" Yikes, frankly. \u00b7 Hats off to the Mirror, now, which carried a splendid spoof of Mr Tony's meeting with the Pres of Kazakhstan. \"Where is the sex-crazed oaf who shames a great nation?\" asks the Pres. \"Who, Borat? Or Mr Prescott?\" replies Mr T, quick as a flash. Just a shame the pic was of the Greek PM. \u00b7 Returning to his car six minutes after a Richmond parking meter had run out, Tom Baker, ex-Time Lord, rages in the Bucks Free Press at \"the borough that doesn't want people using its excellent shops, pubs and riverside facilities\". Course, it wouldn't have happened if he'd stuck to his Tardis. Arf. \u00b7 The London assembly, it seems, may soon be graced with yet another Three Job Bob. More next week. \u00b7 Ah, those songs! Where to begin? We loved John Roan, we adored Collyer's Grammar (\"And let us show / To those who follow / That still our motto / Is 'Honor Deo'\"), but our joint winners are Calday Grange Grammar (\"And there an ancient school was set / That learning's lamp might light the range / In honour of Almighty God / By William Glegg of Calday Grange\") and Merchant Taylors', Crosby (final verse: \"Thus till our mortal bark / Shall reach life's further shore / And failing eyelids close / To ope on earth no more / Scatter'd the world around / How far so e'er we be / Nurse of our boyhood's days / We will remember thee.\") Reader, we wept. diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
