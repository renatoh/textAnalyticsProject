That is the bad news. The good news is that it has a decent destination. Set half in Barbados and half in Leytonstone, Perseverance Drive features a West Indian family marinated in religion, brought together by the death of a matriarch and torn apart by different attitudes to faith. It is fairly evident that the censorious patriarch will be disappointed by the most pious of his offspring, and that the son scorned for being gay will turn out to be the kindest of the bunch. When did a black sheep not prove to be the most sympathetic character on the stage? Still, the subject of religious difference is an unusual one for the stage these days and Soans's delineation of the warring factions is exact: his background as a writer of verbatim drama pays off. Frances Ashman and Akiya Henry are particularly strong as two women treated as if being a wife were a full-time job. Jaimie Todd's design offers an ingenious pop-up church. Though the play is hardly an argument for religious faith, Madani Younis's production makes the case for its communal power in beautifully full-throated hymn singing: something to aim for \u2013 and fail at. Perseverance Drive continues at the Bush until 16 August"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
