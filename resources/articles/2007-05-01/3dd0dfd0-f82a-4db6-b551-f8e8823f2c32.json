It was an unusual situation which KFC had blown out of all proportion. Their legal drones trawled the internet, alighting upon a pub using a slogan for a Christmas Day meal, Family Feast, that KFC had trademarked. The fact that there were 21,000 other family feasts on the net did not interest them. But use of the phrase by Tracy Daly, landlady of Tan Hill Inn, the highest pub in Britain, did. So started a four-day battle between a bullying multinational and a little lady on a hill. KFC said it was protecting a trademark in which it had invested significant resources. But all their threat of legal action achieved was to stir up up a worldwide blizzard of publicity for Ms Daly and her pub. In one week the website of the Tan Hill Inn got 26,000 hits - twice as many as KFC's. Ms Daly has appeared in the media of 27 different countries, making her pub a worldwide brand. No wonder KFC said it was dropping the action and would allow Ms Daly to continue using the offending words. How many people will now turn up for her next Christmas dinner is anyone's guess. \"I could never have paid for this publicity,\" Ms Daly said yesterday, revealing that she had offered the fast-food giant one of her own secret recipes. The moral of the story? Think before you trawl the internet for transgressors, otherwise you risk getting your much-licked fingers burned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
