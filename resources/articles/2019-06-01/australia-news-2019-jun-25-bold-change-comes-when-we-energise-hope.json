That as a community we are unable or unwilling to embrace big ideas. That as a country we put materialist self-interest ahead of concerns for the environment or workers\u2019 rights. But beware such an election analysis \u2013 it is one based less on fact and more in the desire to divide us. What if the analysis instead critiqued the state of our democracy as being inadequate to the task of having a nuanced conversation within the community about complex and often contradictory issues? What if it\u2019s the binary choices of yes and no, Liberal or Labor, that fails to excite people\u2019s imaginations, engage their passions or earn their trust? What if voting has become divorced from people\u2019s real lives, their insecurities and their guilty pleasures? The \u201cgreat polarisation\u201d then looks much more like a great weary, uninspired middle. The failure to embrace the bold may be because the bold was not bold enough to transport and transform. And it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that self-interest and care for the environment can reasonably coexist for people up to their eyeballs in debt, feeling as though life is a constant scramble but also worried about the future and the planet. So beware the simplistic take-outs \u2013 there\u2019s much more to this story than statistics. And despite what seems like a devastating loss of \u201cwhat could have been\u201d there is still much hope to build on. Rather than pollsters, commentators or politicians tell us what happened let\u2019s find and tell our own stories. It is time for a very different conversation. Not because of the loss of an election and the \u201cneed to find a new way to reconnect\u201d but because this is how to move ideas and people in a world of hollowed-out public spaces. The complexity of the challenges demands a deeper, richer engagement and we need to build this outside the stultifying constraints of formal political debate. None of this should be surprising. We are simply reaping what has been sown for several decades in Australia. The political orthodoxy has been predicated on the dominance of the market and politicians have been redefined as market managers. Politicians as accountants in suits and frocks don\u2019t feel very relatable, they certainly don\u2019t inspire, rarely seem to understand and don\u2019t particularly engender trust. The conversation could be very different if, like New Zealand\u2019s wellbeing budget, there was instead a focus on tackling mental health or raising children out of poverty \u2013 instead commentators and the media talked about franking credits. It\u2019s not as if Australians aren\u2019t up for a deeper, more meaningful conversation. The warm embrace of the national disability insurance scheme and its Every Australian Counts campaign shows people are open to bold, collectivist responses to big societal issues \u2013 and are even prepared to part with their own money to make change possible. So how can progressive Australians engage and mobilise this deeper humanity? How can the debate be moved beyond simplistic matters to more complex ones and find common ground around the big issues of our time? The first step is not to rush to a series of town hall meetings or kitchen table talks \u2013 to \u201cunderstand better\u201d or, even worse, \u201cunderstand so we can then convince people of our view\u201d. Rather it is to be self-reflective about the way those of us seeking progressive change operate. Naomi Klein was spot on when she urged us all to understand that \u201csaying no is not enough\u201d. Too often we front our campaigns and messaging around opposition. Instead, we need to lead by inspiring, exciting, energising and building hope. Those things come with the positivity that a vision-led approach provides. It means shifting from movements of dissent to movements of transformation. Secondly, we need to stop promoting ourselves as \u201cchange-makers\u201d. Many in our community are change-weary or change-resistant. It is hard to embrace change when you\u2019re already feeling insecure. Part of the conservative appeal \u2013 as false as it is \u2013 is the appeal to comfort and security \u2013 to empty optimism. We need to focus on the cake, not the recipe. We don\u2019t just stand for change, we actually stand for people having the agency and organisation to respond and shape the inevitable changes occurring around us. And thirdly we need to understand the \u201ccontradiction conundrum\u201d. That is, that people can hold simultaneously many contradictory views \u2013 so they can like shopping but be concerned about the environment, they can be worried about refugees but be best mates with their migrant neighbours and they can want tax cuts as well as better public services. Let\u2019s face it, we\u2019re human. What leaders of progressive ideas need to understand is that there is invariably a kernel of truth in why people have discomforting views. It is not unreasonable for people in mining communities to be concerned about mine closures if there is not a replacement regional economic strategy or labour transition plan. It is not unreasonable for workers to support a government that looks \u201csteady\u201d if their job is insecure and their house values are falling. We need to understand and respect the issues and realities that give rise to difference and in understanding try to find the common ground that unites us. This also requires us to understand that a single-issue focus is inadequate to move big ideas. We need in our own campaigns to understand that people want a connected-up response that speaks to the many moving parts of their lives. For all that competition, individualism and efficiency have been rammed down our throats since the 1970s, most Australians still actually share a lot of common values. Our own experience in talking with many different Australians in the making of the vision Australia reMADE confirmed this. We saw just how much people still believe in everyone being treated fairly; in kids being supported to thrive; to basic services being available to all; to life being enjoyable, safe and secure; and for community and family life to be rich, joyous and fulfilling. We might differ on how you get there but the aspirations are widely shared. But this common ground doesn\u2019t have to be the middle ground or the sickeningly sweet \u201csensible centre\u201d \u2026 whatever that is. The reality is that maintaining those very elements of joy, security, fairness and care that Australians desire requires bold and transformative thinking in a world where everything is in flux. Climate change, automation and economic malaise will not allow us to stand still \u2013 regardless of Scott Morrison\u2019s grinning optimism. Bold responses will be required and they need to be rooted in both those shared values and in recognising and responding to those discomforting views. Our political system is hopelessly inadequate to leading that conversation but progressive civil society can and must. So the election result tells us little more than that our formal politics isn\u2019t up to the task of responding to the big issues rending and reshaping our world. It actually masks the abundance of common ground in our community and it fails to encourage the exploration of difference and complexity inherent in finding ways forward. And it fundamentally underestimates people\u2019s willingness to engage in such a conversation. There\u2019s fertile ground and pressing need \u2013 so yes, less mourning and a greater, wider conversation is required. \u2022 Louise Tarrant chairs the Australia reMADE secretariat"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
