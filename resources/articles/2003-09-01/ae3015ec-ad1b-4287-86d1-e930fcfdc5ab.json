Pablo Aimar and Cesar Delgado scored the other first-half goals as the visitors ended Venezuela's unbeaten home run of 11 matches with a dominant display. \"We knew we had to win convincingly. We couldn't give up even one point and we did it,\" said the midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron, who had been roundly booed by the Buenos Aires crowd during Argentina's disappointing 2-2 draw in their opening fixture against Chile on Saturday. \"We needed this result,\" agreed Argentina's under-fire coach Marcelo Bielsa, who surprisingly kept his job after last year's first-round exit at the World Cup. \"The fact that we drew with Chile increased that need. It seems like a fair result and perhaps we could have won by a bigger margin.\" Crespo, who has himself been severely criticised since last year's World Cup debacle, headed in Delgado's cross in the 26th minute after Aimar had opened the scoring in the eighth minute by burying the rebound from a Crespo shot. A solo effort by Delgado in the 32nd minute effectively ended the match as a contest, giving Argentina three valuable points and taking them briefly top of the group. The Venezuela coach Richard Paez, who has overseen a dramatic improvement in his traditionally also-ran team in the last two years, said he was proud of his team despite the defeat. \"The team never lost its style and never lost its identity,\" said Paez, who was sent from the dug-out for insulting the referee. \"We're getting better with every game.\" In Santiago two headed goals gave Chile a 2-1 victory over Peru in a bad-tempered match. Mauricio Pinilla, the 19-year-old Chievo Verona striker, headed Chile's first in the 35th minute off a left-wing cross from Rodrigo Perez. Peru hit back on the break early in the second half, Andres Mendoza striking a fine equaliser after latching on to a long ball out of defence by the left-back Martin Hidalgo. But in the 70th minute Arturo Norambuena settled the tie three minutes after coming on as a substitute, outmuscling a defender to head in David Pizarro's free-kick. The 10 South American teams play a single round-robin league over 2 years for four automatic qualification places for the World Cup in Germany. The fifth-placed team goes into a play-off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
