He was brought up in a township in Port Elizabeth by his grandmother and slept on cushions on a floor: this is the first World Cup since the 1995 tournament South Africa hosted when the majority of the population is behind them. \u201cIt was tough at the beginning after I was made captain,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a big thing at home and worldwide and it took its toll on me. My performance dipped quite a lot and I had to work hard and refocus on my game. I have awesome leaders around me, like Handre [Pollard], Duane [Vermeulen] and Eben [Etzebeth]. We are different South Africans from different walks of life who have bought into coach Rassie\u2019s plans and know what we want to achieve. \u201cI know what we have done here is big back home and I have not seen this much support for the team since I have been playing. The president was speaking about the final in parliament, asking the whole country to wear Springbok jerseys and, if you are in a car, to hoot at one o\u2019clock. We have the country behind us and that is huge. I cannot imagine what it will be like if we win. \u201cWe know it is not just another game but the World Cup final. Emotions are high and we have to channel them the right way. There is pressure, but that can help you lift your performance. Not many players get this opportunity and we appreciate that. It may be my 50th cap, but it is a special day for every single guy in the team and those in the squad who are not involved but who have played a full part.\u201d Kolisi\u2019s father, Fezakel, who instilled in his son a love of rugby, arrived here on Friday morning. \u201cI am really happy that I could organise it for him to come,\u201d said the captain. \u201cIt is his first time overseas and he came with my best friend. It is one of the things that makes me grateful I play rugby: you can do something like this for your family members.\u201d South Africa have got to the final by taking an uncomplicated route. Their gameplan has varied little in the big matches, based on identifying the strengths of their opponents and nullifying them, largely through force, while taking a minimum of risks and trusting their defence. Boks kicking has taken on a whole new meaning. \u201cWe trust our plan,\u201d said Kolisi. \u201cIt has got us this far and we do not have to change much. We just have to give it everything and we are not going to do anything different. The past four games against England have been arm wrestles in which momentum has swung. You never know, there may be beautiful tries scored but it will all come down to who handles the occasion best.\u201d Given South Africa\u2019s meticulous preparation that has helped them defuse the very different threats of Japan and Wales in the knockout rounds, will they be paying special attention to Maro Itoje, whose powers of destruction wreaked havoc on New Zealand in the semi-final? \u201cWe prepare on what we need to do,\u201d said Kolisi. \u201cYou always say you cannot focus on individuals but you look at one or two players to see their strong points. We have watched England and we have plans and systems for them, but I am not going to share them here.\u201d Itoje captained England to victory in the 2014 Junior World Championship final against South Africa in Auckland. The young Springboks were led by Pollard who made his Test debut before the second-row and was part of the squad in the 2015 World Cup. \u201cIt is no secret that finals have been decided by drop-kicks and penalties,\u201d he said. \u201cI love the pressure of that. It is why you train and put in the hours and why as a little boy you imagine you are taking a kick to win a World Cup final. You have basically been preparing your whole life for that moment. Yes there is going to be pressure, but you have to embrace it and enjoy the occasion. \u201cWe may have a few different plays for England, but like them we have a blueprint. What we and they believe in is not going to change in a week. We trust in our system and pride ourselves on our great defensive record. There will be a line in the sand that they will try to cross and we will try to stop them. Everything will stay the same for both sides; no disco lights.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
