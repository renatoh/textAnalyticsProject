But, thanks to the internet, you no longer have to take anyone's word for it; you can check out the acts online for yourself. The new year's surest of surefire bets appears to be Adele, the London soul/jazz singer. To understand the fuss, watch a stirring six-song session Adele recorded for Radio 2 just before Christmas at . The 19-year-old belts out her lovelorn, retro-tinged songs in a strikingly rich, husky voice that recalls Ella Fitzgerald, Alison Moyet and, particularly, Amy Winehouse. Adele's music perhaps lacks Winehouse's spark and personality, but supermarket-led success clearly beckons. If you'd prefer your 2008 hopefuls a little rougher around the edges check out a rollicking four-song Xfm session by Oxford dance-punks Foals, whose upcoming debut album should be greeted with plenty of favourable comparisons to Bloc Party and the Rapture. Another dance-tinged indie act heading for success are the Ting Tings, an unashamedly poppy Manchester duo who burst to wider attention with a televised set at last year's Glastonbury. Watch it in full at the BBC's site to see why. Despite not yet signing a record deal, the Glaswegian four-piece Glasvegas have also got taste-makers in a lather. The band saw their independently released Daddy's Gone single named NME's second-best track of 2007, with Alan McGee, Ian Brown and Carl Bar\u00e2t all declaring themselves fans. Of course, the Twang were similarly lauded this time last year, only for interest to fall sharply away when they released their disappointing album. But the quality of the four tunes available on MySpace points to Glasvegas outliving the hype. Sounding like a rockabilly Doves produced by Phil Spector, they prove you actually can write modern guitar-pop anthems without trying to sound like the Libertines. Whipping up a storm Stateside are Chicago rap duo the Cool Kids. Describing themselves as \"the black Beastie Boys\", the pair make old-school hip-hop with a breezy swagger. Not that this is a retro-fest: there's an unmistakable freshness to the sparse, bass-heavy beats and squelching electro hooks driving their tracks. Judging by the videos from a riotous-looking Chicago show at their debut UK tour in February will be well worth splashing your Christmas money on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
