But I am beginning to wonder, from his recent behaviour and speeches, whether the chancellor is having a midlife crisis. First we were told that the last thing he intended to do on his recent trip to Washington was to crow about the putative success of his Great Economic Plan, and attack his critics for having got it so wrong. The cheeky chappie could not resist, however. He proceeded in a speech to the American Enterprise Institute \u2013 a rightwing thinktank where he felt very much at home \u2013 to crow about the putative success of his policies and to attack his critics for having got it so wrong. He began by boasting that the UK's growth rate had been the fastest in the G7 over the past year \u2013 no reference to three years of \"flatlining\". Then there was all that stuff about \"record rates of job creation\" \u2013 no reference to the huge numbers in involuntary part-time work, sometimes disguised as \"running a small business\", or, for that matter, to all those on zero-hour contracts. He then, with wonderful condescension, informed his American audience that \"jobs are also being created in the US\". When the chancellor says \"cutting deficits and controlling spending has not choked off recovery but has instead laid the foundations for sustainable growth\", he is \u2013 an unfortunate habit of his recently \u2013 setting up a man of straw. Economies usually recover eventually, even in the face of the most damaging economic policies. The point is that, in the face of the depression brought on by the banking crisis, the chancellor deliberately introduced a fiscal squeeze that severely delayed the recovery. And when Osborne goes on to blame the eurozone crisis and its effect on our exports for \"slower than forecast growth\", he conveniently omits a rather important point: it was precisely because the eurozone was imposing the policies of austerity which he himself preached that its demand for our exports was so low. Again: the chancellor told his audience that the recession in the UK was almost twice as deep as it was in the US, not noting that this might have something to do with his fiscal squeeze. This involved, according to the IMF, a squeeze on the public finances of 1.6% (on average) in each of the last four years \u2013 which he actually boasted of as \"the largest and most sustained of any major advanced economy\". The point about the comparison with the US position is that, although critics such as the great Paul Krugman would have preferred a much bigger stimulus, the US did not impose as savage a squeeze as the UK or, a fortiori, the eurozone. The chancellor returned to London to lots of better news about inflation and unemployment, together with calculations that on average the squeeze on real incomes is not quite as bad as it was \u2013 although, according to the estimable Office for National Statistics, the median in \"non-retired households\" was 6.4% lower in 2011-12 than 2007-08, so there is a long way to go to get back to where we were. Which brings me to a delightful book by the economist Russell Jones, The Itinerant Economist \u2013 Memoirs of a Dismal Scientist, which contains a firsthand account of what it was like to work in the financial markets in the post-deregulation phase that nearly destroyed the capitalist system. Osborne might care to note one of Jones's conclusions: \"Sovereign debt crises are invariably the result of private sector credit booms turning to bust. The global financial crisis had little to do with public sector profligacy per se, even if historically high levels of public-sector debt subsequently acted to compromise the fiscal policy response to it.\" As Jones emphasises: \"Overcoming a sovereign debt crisis requires sustained economic growth \u2026 it cannot be cured by fiscal austerity alone.\" We are now experiencing some growth, although the pace of recovery is not sensational by past standards, and there are manifest concerns about the form this growth is taking and the chances of sustaining it. My mind goes back to a remark made by a predecessor of Mark Carney's at the Bank of England, Eddie George: \"Unbalanced growth is better than no growth.\" Well, at least for a time. I continue to believe that there is more spare capacity in the economy than the government's advisers seem to think. In which context it is good news that business investment has been picking up, although, after the long dearth of activity in this sphere, it was perhaps rather tactless of the chancellor to tell his American audience that business investment was growing much faster in the UK than the US. Incidentally, I don't know whether this is connected with the rightwing audience Osborne was addressing, but weird stories are coming from his entourage that he has become obsessed by the strange idea, propagated by the US economist Arthur Laffer in the Reagan years, that tax cuts can pay for themselves. They did not; but they certainly increased the deficit. This may be a pre-election prelude to plans for tax cuts for the well-off, while he continues to punish the poor with another \"austerity\" attack on the welfare budget."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
