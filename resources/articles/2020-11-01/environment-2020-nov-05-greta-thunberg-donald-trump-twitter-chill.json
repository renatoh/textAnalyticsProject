Greta Thunberg, the teenage environmental activist mocked by Donald Trump in a tweet when she was named Time magazine\u2019s person of the year, waited exactly 11 months before delivering the perfect riposte. In his December 2019 insult, Trump told Thunberg, 17, to work on her \u201canger management problem\u201d and to \u201cgo to an old-fashioned movie with a friend\u201d. \u201cChill Greta, chill!\u201d the president implored in the tweet, which began with him branding her Time award as \u201cso ridiculous\u201d. On Thursday afternoon, with Trump raging on Twitter in all capital letters and throwing out baseless allegations of voter fraud even as his election day lead in Pennsylvania and other states continued to erode, Thunberg threw his words straight back at him. \u201cSo ridiculous,\u201d Thunberg tweeted in reply to Trump\u2019s earlier \u201cSTOP THE COUNT!\u201d rant. \u201cDonald must work on his Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Donald, Chill!\u201d Within two hours of posting it, the tweet had amassed more than 452,000 likes, double the total for Trump\u2019s original message. Thunberg has proved something of a nemesis for the climate crisis-denying president, the original Twitter exchange coming barely two months after the pair crossed paths at the United Nations in New York. Trump skipped the climate summit at which Thunberg told world leaders, \u201cYou are failing us,\u201d but she fixed Trump with an icy stare in a hallway as he made his way to another event on religious freedom. This week has added poignancy for Thunberg due to the formal exit from the Paris climate agreement by the United States on Wednesday. In October, Thunberg endorsed Trump\u2019s election rival Joe Biden, who has pledged to return the US to the global pact on his first day in office."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
