Ivan Perisic\u2019s injury time equaliser ensures the 165th derby ends 2-2. Milan were second best for long spells but led twice and were denied a victory that would have sent them second on their own. Instead they are tired with Roma, while Inter climb to ninth thanks to this point. What a game. Thanks for reading. Bye! 90 min +3: Immediately from the restart Milan attack and Pasalic drives wide. 90 min +2: Oh wow! They\u2019ve done it. The corner is flicked on by Murillo towards Perisic at the backpost and he bundles home from a couple of yards. 90 min +1: Milan have everybody back and are clinging on. D\u2019Ambrosio finds Jovetic with a cross from the right but Abate is on hand to deflect the sub\u2019s header out for a corner. Handanovic is on his way up \u2026 90 min: There will be a minimum of three minutes added time. 89 min: Another minute passes by without any bother for Donnarumma. 88 min: Inter are dominant but Milan are shutting the game down well. Their final sub sees Pasalic, on loan from Chelsea, trot on for Bonaventura. 86 min: Jovetic hits a hopeless through ball forward that ends up rolling out for a goal-kick, ruining the momentum built up by Inter. 85 min: Inter are turning up the heat, Milan are sitting deep. Will there be a leveller? 84 min: Big chance for Icardi. He runs towards the front stick and meets a Perisic cross from the left. Donnarumma saves. 82 min: The game is becoming quite fragmented now, there are lots of cynical fouls and the referee\u2019s whistle is permanently attached to his mouth. 79 min: Milan\u2019s second switch: Lapadula replaces Niang. 78 min: Jovetic\u2019s first act is to be booked for putting an arm across Bonaventura as the Milan midfielder broke. That was silly \u2013 Jovetic is quick and has fresh legs. 76 min: Perisic has a deflected shot that\u2019s heading out for a corner until Donnarumma riskily makes his way out to save. The ball spills from underneath him but he keeps hold of it with a second attempt. 75 min: Inter\u2019s second sub sees Jovetic (remember him?) enter in place of Brozovic. 74 min: Bonaventura rolls the ball to Kucka, He blasts about 10m over the bar. Dismal, but they have killed a fair chunk of time. 72 min: Bonaventura dribbles in from the left and is dragged down by Kondogbia, who is already on a yellow, about 30 yards from goal. That will waste another minute. 71 min: Brosovic\u2019s delivery from the corner meets Murillo\u2019s head, but he cannot find the target. The ball drifts wide to the left of Donnarumma\u2019s net. The keeper is then given a warning for taking his time over the goal-kick. 70 min: Perisic wins a corner off Locatelli. Milan make their first sub: Fernandez replaces Bacca. 69 min: Icardi misses another glorious chance. He escapes Gomez with ease but snatches at Brozovic\u2019s through ball and Donnarumma makes an easy stop. 67 min: Perisic goes close again. It\u2019s far more difficult than the three first half chances he missed but this is the closest of all. Candreva finds him with a no-backlift pass, the Croatian controls and turns. From a tight angle his shot looks to have Donnarumma beaten but it flashes across goal and narrowly wide. 66 min: Inter now look a tad frustrated and you get the sense Milan could punish them again on the break. Nagatomo has replaced Ansaldi, which is a clever decision. 64 min: Ansaldi fouls Suso again and the Inter players are quick to rush over and ask for a second yellow. The referee ignores their calls, though. This must be the Inter left-back\u2019s final chance. 63 min: Mario sends in a cross from the left that is too deep and Milan have a goal-kick. 61 min: Kucka finds Suso again. He tries to be a tad too clever this time and is dispossessed by Miranda. 60 min: Suso is now clumsily fouled by Ansaldi, who has already been booked. It\u2019s a free-kick and if the Inter defender commits another like that he will be off. 58 min: And Milan are back in front once more! Wow. Suso skips past an embarrassingly bad challenge from Miranda after good build up from Bonaventura and Bacca, before sliding a tidy left-footed finish low to Handanovic\u2019s right. 57 min: Brozovic feeds Mario down the right. He throws a good dummy to get past De Sciglio but his shot is tame and Donnarumma saves. 56 min: This game had started tentatively and if you had not watched a Milan derby you would have been right to ponder what the fuss was about but the start of this second half has been wonderful. 53 min: What a hit from Antonio Candreva, the man that accused Piolo of kicking him out of Lazio! A simple throw in on the left is worked to Candreva in a central position with Milan arguing that the decision should have gone their way. In any case he takes a touch before unleashing an unstoppable effort into the top right corner. Donnarumma gets a touch but no keeper in the world would be able to keep out such a thumping strike. This is suddenly looking like a great game. 52 min: Suso tries his luck, this time on his left after cutting in again from the right. It fizzes well wide. 51 min: Candreva unleashes a right-footed drive from 25 yards. Donnarumma parries it but has time to smother at the second time of asking. The game is opening up quite a bit now. 49 min: Ansaldi is booked for fouling Suso, who then takes the free-kick. From it Kondogbia concedes a corner and Handanovic does what Donnarumma did moment earlier to claim. 47 min: Inter win a corner. Brozovic\u2019s inswinger is confidently picked from the air by Donnarumma, who then releases the ball immediately to Bacca. The Colombian is unable to control. 46 min: Inter get the game going again. Can they convert their dominance of possession into an equalising goal? An email from Kabir Sethi: \u201cAs an Inter fan I was hoping for the exact opposite \u2013 get dominated, sneak a counter attack goal from random moment of Icardi genius. Oh well.\u201d An email from JR in Illinois: \u201cIn the new world we live in where the Chicago Cubs win the World Series, Ireland beats the All Blacks, and the United States elects an insane maniac to be President the truth is that the biggest game of this weekend is clearly West Brom v Burnley tomorrow. McClean should be good for a brace and/or a red card.\u201d McClean has been in top form \u2026 Milan lead at the break thanks to Suso\u2019s excellent goal. Inter will feel hard done by. 43 min: But whatever, seconds later Suso has scored having been set up by Bacca! At the opposite end Candreva had shot straight at Donnamurra, who set Milan on the counter rapidly. Bacca danced forward centrally before finding Suso to his right. The midfielder cut in past Ansaldi and curled past Handanovic with a magnificent finish. They have been dreadful for most of this game but Milan lead! 42 min: Bacca shoots at Handanovic from the penalty arc. It\u2019s an easy save but Suso\u2019s pass to Bacca should have been much better. 40 min: De Sciglio hits a pot shot from range. It\u2019s got power and accuracy but Handanovic has remained awake and makes the save. That\u2019s the keeper\u2019s first piece of ation this evening. 38 min: Oh my. Candreva mis-hits a shot that ends up going into the path of Icardi. It seems so simple for the striker from eight yards but he cannot connect cleanly and the ball goes out for a goal-kick. That\u2019s another chance for Inter \u2013 and the longer they continue like this without converting, the sooner it seems Milan will punish them with a counterattack despite being generally awful. 37 min: Medel has pulled a muscle and is unable to continue. He is replaced by Murillo, who will be stationed on the right. 35 min: D\u2019Ambrosio shoots after the ball breaks to him on the edge of the box. It\u2019s deflected for a corner, which is taken short to Ansaldi. The left-back finds Perisic, and he cannot find the target. This time he was at least under pressure from a Milan defender. 34 min: Milan still appear frozen. 33 min: Brozovic\u2019s cross is headed away. Poor. 32 min: De Sciglio is lucky not to get a yellow for sliding in late on D\u2019Ambrosio \u2026 and 10 seconds after the free-kick is taken he does the same to Candreva. That one will be a booking. And Inter have a free from a dangerous spot on the right. 31 min: Milan appear frozen. 29 min: And now Candreva \u2013 the No87! \u2013 finds the side-netting from about 30 yards. 28 min: Gomez heads away another threatening cross from the right, this time sent in by Candreva. Inter are enjoying this. 25 min: And now Kondogbia heads wide from a corner. Inter have done everything but convert. Milan currently look like the mid-table fodder, rather than the reverse. 24 min: Perisic has another chance and this is an even worse miss. D\u2019Ambrosio crosses from the right and again Perisic is left unmarked, but his header is poor, drifting wide to Donnarumma\u2019s right. 22 min: Now Kucka is booked for dragging down Kondogbia just inside Milan\u2019s half. 21 min: It\u2019s poor. And Inter clear. 19 min: Kondogbia, who had clattered Niang a couple of minutes earlier, is the first player to be booked \u2013 for using his arm on Bonaventura. Milan have a free-kick on the left from a decent spot. The big men are up and Bonaventura will deliver an inswinger. 16 min: Inter are enjoying a good spell here but Milan have numbers behind the ball and are not easy to penetrate. 14 min: Perisic has the first proper chance of the game. Icardi takes Abate out of the game with a knock on from a cross but the Croatian attacker, with time and space, curls a harmless shot straight at Donnarumma. 12 min: It has been tight, cagey \u2013 and nobody is surprised. Both are employing identical systems and they are very much cancelling each other out. 8 min: Inter have a less convincing penalty appeal, which is also turned away. Abate collides with Mario when heading a D\u2019Ambrosio cross away. 7 min: This is the really big talking point from the evening. Despite Inter wearing white shorts and socks, it is still difficult to make out who\u2019s who. 6 min: Now Inter attack down the left and Perisic wins a corner as Gomez comes across to block his delivery. It is taken short and Mario cannot get a decent ball in, allowing Milan to break \u2026 but not very far as D\u2019Ambrosio hauls down Bacca. 4 min: Niang gets in front of Medel and goes to ground under substantial pressure inside the area. There are loud shouts for an early penalty but the referee, Paolo Tagliavento, points for a goal-kick. Anywhere else on the pitch and it is a foul. 2 min: Inside 90 seconds Perisic goes down injured after an aerial collision with Kucka. The Inter attacker should be all right to continue. 1 min: We are underway in the 165th Milan derby. Milan begin, playing from right to left as we watch. OK, the Milan derby wins when it comes to tifo displays before kick-off. But in terms of standard of football? No chance at the moment. On BT Sport the commentator has said this is the biggest game of the weekend in \u2026 Europe. I think Real v Atl\u00e9tico and Dortmund v Bayern will have something to say about that. Silvio Berlusconi is in the house \u2013 this will be his final derby in charge of Milan before selling the club to a group of Chinese investors next month. The San Siro is heaving and there are eight minutes to go until kick-off. Prediction: Milan 2-0 Internazionale. Milan: Donnarumma; Abate, Paletta, Gomez, De Sciglio; Kucka, Locatelli, Bonaventura; Suso, Bacca, Niang. Subs: Gabriel, Plizzari, Ely, Zapata, Antonelli, Honda, Mati Fernandez, Poli, Sosa, Pasalic, Luiz Adriano, Lapadula. Internazionale: Handanovic; D\u2019Ambrosio, Miranda, Medel, Ansaldi; Brozovic, Mario, Kondogbia\u2019 Candreva, Icardi, Perisic. Subs: Carrizo, Melo, Jovetic, Biabiany, Ranocchia, Banega, Santon, Eder, Murillo, Gnoukouri, Nagatomo, Barbosa. Hello. Milan and Internazionale have both been rather ordinary for a couple of seasons now but this derby still commands worldwide attention and for the first time in a long time there is significance beyond local bragging rights. Victory for tonight\u2019s home team would move them second, five points behind Juventus, while Inter could be already out of contention for a European spot with defeat. They sit 11th presently and have already had a change of manager. What a game for Stefano Pioli to begin. Kick-off at San Siro is 8.45pm local time (7.45pm GMT). Team news to follow soon. In the meantime, why not enjoy a walk down memory lane alongside Luca Hodges-Ramon as he reminisces about how Mark Hateley became a Rossoneri hero: In the summer of 1984, two of football\u2019s most distinguished names earned record-breaking moves to Serie A. Diego Maradona left Barcelona to join Napoli for \u00a36.9m (then a world record fee) and Internazionale paid Bayern Munich \u00a34.7m for Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Accompanying the duo was Mark Hateley, who arrived from Portsmouth. Milan paid the Second Division club \u00a31m for the 23-year-old English forward. Hateley was bought to replace his compatriot Luther Blissett, who had spent one dismal season at the club and earned cult status among fans for being a super-bidone (rubbish). Though Hateley had enjoyed a prolific season on the south coast, scoring 22 goals in 38 games, the fact that Milan plundering the English second tier for attacking talent shows how badly they were struggling. Physical prowess was not the only weapon in Hateley\u2019s armoury. He was an intelligent operator who was constantly aware of his surroundings and his opponents\u2019 flaws \u2026 In Italy, Hateley will forever be remembered for his derby-day heroics.
