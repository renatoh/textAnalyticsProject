Obama welcomed the selection of a new prime minister by Iraq\u2019s president Faud Massoum on Monday, describing it as a \u201cpromising step forward\u201d toward a more inclusive government. \u201cUnder the Iraqi constitution this is an important step toward forming a new government that can unite Iraq\u2019s different communities,\u201d said the US president in a statement from his vacation home on the island of Martha\u2019s Vineyard. The Obama administration had become increasingly strident in its criticism of Maliki in recent weeks, accusing him of the current Islamic uprising by failing to govern in the interest of all Iraqis. But officials rejected allegations on Monday that it was encouraging \u201cregime change\u201d, insisting instead that the US was merely supporting a constitutional process rather than favouring individual politicians in Baghdad. \u201cThe US stands ready to support a government that addresses the needs and grievances of all Iraqi people,\u201d added Obama, in a short address which did not mention al-Maliki by name. He also dangled the prospect of direct US military support against the Islamic State, the separatists also known as Isis or Isil, if the putative new prime minister Haider al-Abadi succeeds in forming a lasting government. \u201cJust as the US will remain vigilant against the threat posed to our people by Isil we stand ready to partner with Iraq in its fight against these terrorist forces,\u201d Obama said. US vice-president Joe Biden immediately telephoned president Massoum and Haider al-Abadi, whom the White House described as \u201cprime minister designate\u201d, to offer greater US military support in their efforts to defeat Isis. Secretary of state John Kerry said a new government was \u201ccritical in terms of sustaining the stability and calm in Iraq,\u201d urging Maliki not to \u201cstir those waters\u201d by obstructing Abadi\u2019s efforts to form a new coalition government in the coming days. The Daily Beast alleged on Monday that two senior US officials, the American ambassador to Iraq Robert Beecroft and deputy assistant secretary of state Brett McGurk, have been working to shore up Abadi behind the scenes for the past month. It said that Obama had \u201cinstructed his diplomats in Washington and Baghdad to find an alternative\u201d to Maliki. Obama has repeatedly stated in public that the US should not influence the choice for Iraq\u2019s prime minister. \u201cIt\u2019s not the place for the United States to choose Iraq\u2019s leaders,\u201d Obama said on 19 June. Apparently stung by suggestions this might be another case of attempted US-led regime change in Baghdad, the State Department denied there had been any role, at any level by American officials in helping pick the new candidate. \u201cWe support the process,\u201d spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters. \u201cWe have never supported anyone person or one party here.\u201d Asked about Monday\u2019s phone calls by Biden, who also rang Massoum and Kurdish leaders last week but not Maliki, Harf added: \u201cIt\u2019s not about who we speak to on the phone; it\u2019s about who the Iraqis choose through their process, which they have done today, to be their next prime minister.\u201d A US decision to arm Kurdish fighters directly, confirmed earlier on Monday, is likely to have heaped extra pressure on Maliki\u2019s government in Baghdad and Harf ducked repeated questions about whether the US has sought explicit Iraqi support for the shipment. But the precarious situation in Baghdad was underlined by reports that Maliki had increased security forces on the streets and may be resisting efforts to oust him. \u201cHe is still the prime minister, legally and under the constitution,\u201d said Harf, when asked whether the US considered he still had political legitimacy. Earlier Kerry said the US stands \u201cabsolutely squarely behind President Massoum\u201d, but urged restraint amid reports that Maliki may resist what he called a coup against his government. \u201cWhat we urge the people of Iraq to do is to be calm,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cThere should be no use force, no introduction of troops or militias into this moment of democracy for Iraq.\u201d Biden\u2019s involvement was his fourth diplomatic intervention in as many days indicating that further American military support could follow swiftly if Abadi and Massoum succeed in their efforts to form a new government. Pointedly referring to Abadi as the Iraqi prime minister-designate, a White House spokesman said: \u201cThe vice-president relayed President Obama\u2019s congratulations and restated his commitment to fully support a new and inclusive Iraqi government, particularly in its fight against Isil.\u201d Former US officials in Washington also cautioned that the appointment of Abadi by president Massoum, though supported by White House, was not yet a definitive sign of the more inclusive Iraqi government that Obama has been calling for. \u201cThe prime minister still has to be able to form a government, so I am not sure it is really game over,\u201d said Jon Alterman, Middle East program director at the Center for Srategic and International Studies. \u201cNouri al-Maliki is a hard-knuckled veteran of all of this and he is not afraid to roll the dice ... he is willing to take risks.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
