Although data suggests crime figures have significantly declined in the last decade, two academics say life on Britain's streets is not as rosy as it is being painted. Professors Simon Winlow and Steve Hall of Teesside University warn that modern trends, such as the shift of offences from the street to the internet, make contemporary crime statistics unproportional and unreliable. The two, who next month will launch the university's centre for realist criminology, are calling for a new approach to recording crime. In addition, the number of police officers has fallen for the fourth consecutive year with Home Office figures published last month revealing there are 14,186 fewer than when the coalition government came to power in March 2010. Winlow said: \"It is ridiculous for criminologists to argue that, because we are seeing statistical falls in crime, the world is becoming a nicer place and that our society is becoming more civilised and humane.\" Hall said: \"Criminal markets are changing in ways that are leaving traditional policing methods trailing in the dust.\" The official crime survey last month revealed a further 9% drop over the last year, meaning that the crime rate stands at its lowest level since the quarterly survey began in 1981. The rate, the survey said, was less than half the peak level it reached in 1995. Separate figures of crime recorded by the police last month corroborated the significant drop, falling 7% in the 12 months to March 2013 to 3.7m offences. David Cameron described the figures as good news, saying that Britain was \"getting safer as well as stronger\". However, Winlow said the prime minister was mistaken in taking the data at face value."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
