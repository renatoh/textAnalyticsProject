The shares lost a quarter of their value, ending the day down 4p at 13p. The warning followed similarly downbeat assessments of the industry from rivals Colt and Cable &amp; Wireless over the summer and dragged the entire sector lower. Investors have been left feeling that trading in the telecoms sector is still far from stable and the stocks are best avoided until its prospects for recovery are clearer. Colt said at the start of July that corporate customers were holding off spending on next-generation network services and the market remained tough. Later in the month C&amp;W said that revenues had fallen over the previous quarter across its businesses and trading continued to be difficult. Yesterday Thus said its half-year earnings would be below last year's \u00a320.6m and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the year as a whole would be \"not less than\" \u00a339 - below last year's \u00a343.6m and well short of City forecasts of \u00a354m. In a note on the stock by Thus' joint broker Investec yesterday, analyst Christian Maher said the main factor behind the warning had been a \"material deterioration\" in pricing in the UK market over recent weeks. He fingered C&amp;W, Colt, MCI and Energis as \"being particularly aggressive and we find it difficult to forecast when pricing will improve\". As a result of Thus' \"bearish outlook for the sector\" the broker moved its stance on the company to hold from buy. A spokesman for C&amp;W denied that the company has been aggressively going after new customers by writing unprofitable business. \"It's completely ridiculous,\" he said. C&amp;W shares, however, closed down 2p at 100.75p. Colt fell 2.75p to 43.75p. Among blue chip stocks Barclays bounced sharply -20p higher at 540p, making it the highest FTSE 100 riser - after the poor reception given on Thursday to the bank's talks with South Africa's fourth-biggest bank, ABSA. Some analysts were yesterday reining back their negative comments, noting the acquisition would instantly add to earnings. Barclays' recovery helped the FTSE 100 to a 9.8-point rise, closing at 4578.1. Despite yesterday's gains, it was the market's poorest performance in six weeks. Cadbury Schweppes dropped 8.25p to 426.75p after again stressing that full-year results are expected to come in at the lower end of the target range. The group insisted this had been made clear in July when it published its interim results, but yesterday it said that its European beverages business had had a more difficult summer than anticipated. Analysts noted the group is approaching the most critical stage of its integration of Adams, the US business acquired last year. Unilever, which has seen its shares slip all week, was another conspicuous faller among consumer stocks. It closed down 5.5p at 454p. Steel maker Corus remained unchanged after a troubled fortnight at 48.75p. Fund management group Fidelity, which had been buying Corus shares last month, emerged as the latest - albeit modest - seller, disclosing that its stake had been shaved to 2.95%. Concerns have focused on whether Russian shareholder Alisher Usmanov is looking to reduce his 13.4% holding. Man Group rallied 13p to \u00a312.36 after Merrill Lynch countered a downgrade from Morgan Stanley on Thursday. Merrills reiterated its \"buy\" recommendation and held its target price at \u00a322.00. Meanwhile, the speculation that gripped tobacco stocks on Thursday appeared to die down. Gallaher lost 4.5p to 639p; Imperial Tobacco fell 12p to \u00a312.08. BAT was also down - losing 10p to 807.5p. Pilkington shares gained 2p at 87.75p after the glass maker said in a trading statement that it was showing signs of success against the backdrop of rising gas and electricity costs and a weak dollar. It said it would post flat interim profits next week. Analysts had been expecting small declines. It said it was making \"good progress\" on cost reductions. Goldman Sachs increased its holding in Ebookers, disclosing yesterday that its stake had risen to 44.1% after having sold its holding down to 42.9% in March. Takeover speculation continued to swirl around cement maker RMC, with Mexican firm Cemex among the names being mentioned as potential bidders. The shares closed up 17.5p at 599p. Deltex Medical rose 1.5p to 28.75p after the medical equipment group said the latest trials of its heart monitoring system could help reduce the length of stay for patients on the machines by 30%. Previous estimates had been 20%. Oil exploration group Melrose Resources said it has had some success from two wells in the South Batra region in Egypt. Production tests will be required before a clearer picture of reserves emerges, but yesterday its shares rose 11.5p to 299p. DDD, which specialises in three-dimensional imaging, said first-half losses had widened slightly but that there had been considerable positive feedback from its latest products. The shares lost 1p to close at 11p. Dana Petroleum gained 15p to 386p after the Department of Trade and Industry gave its approval for the development of the Gadwall oilfield in the central North Sea. The group has a 50% stake in a joint venture exploration project. The first oil from Gadwall is expected by February next year and estimated recoverable reserves amount to 7.3m barrels."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
