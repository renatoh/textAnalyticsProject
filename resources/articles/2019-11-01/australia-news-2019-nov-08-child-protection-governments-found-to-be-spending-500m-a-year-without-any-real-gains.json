It said governments \u201cshould focus on what outcomes they are collectively achieving from their investments, rather than seeking credit for individual funding announcements\u201d. The damning assessment, in the commission\u2019s draft report released on Friday, said the governments were operating in isolation in a system which was so fragmented they didn\u2019t know what each other was doing or whether services were having any impact \u2013 and fundamental change was needed. Children in the NT are four times more likely to come into contact with the child protection system than other Australian children. In an effort to address the hugely disproportionate rate, the NT and commonwealth governments have made significant financial commitments, spending about $538m in 2018-19. But the Productivity Commission found the money \u2013 which went through nine funding agencies in more than 700 grants to more than 500 service providers \u2013 was being spent without an understanding of what communities need, or what was already being funded by other agencies. \u201cThere is inadequate coordination between and within both governments, with each often unaware of what the other is funding and of what is being delivered on the ground,\u201d the commission said. \u201cThere is immense goodwill, positive reforms and pockets of good practice, but a fundamental shift in approach is needed \u2013 one that is underpinned by a stronger commitment to transparency and collaboration between governments, service providers and communities. \u201cThis would help to ensure that governments are collectively accountable for achieving their shared objective \u2013 of keeping children and young people safe and well.\u201d The report found a particular overlap in services addressing family violence and crisis accomodation, justice and legal services, sport and recreation, and community development services. In some locations dual services existed, while in other places there was nothing. Some individual services were funded from as many as seven different sources. Participants in the study also drew the commission\u2019s attention to gaps in services, including youth mental health, parenting programs, access to safe houses and various youth justice services including rehabilitation. In answer to a long-running complaint in the sector about unpredictable short-term contracts, which hindered long-term plans as well as staff hiring and retention, the commission recommended the government transition to contracts with a minimum seven years, with exceptions for things like program trials. The contracts should also cover the full cost of the service and properly took into account the capacity of organisations, particularly in Indigenous communities. A key finding of the NT royal commission into the protection and detention of children was that government funding was not properly tracked, monitored or evaluated. The commission noted there were more than 15 different types of geographical units used in NT government expenditure reports, and in some cases the money couldn\u2019t be linked to specific towns or communities. The NT government has been criticised previously over a lack of transparency in its Indigenous expenditure. It recommended a formal process between the federal and territory governments which agreed on each\u2019s level of funding, and pooled some funds for distribution based on needs identified in conjunction with the actual communities where they were directed. \u201cCommunity plans should be developed that provide a snapshot of the strengths and needs of children and families in the community and give community voice about which children and family services they would like to retain, change or replace.\u201d While there were positive moves being made, including the NT government\u2019s $230m reform packaged announced after the royal commission, its plan to transfer some government services to Aboriginal communities over the next 10 years, and the federal government\u2019s moving of Indigenous policy into a new specific agency, it wasn\u2019t enough. The significant changes wouldn\u2019t need to substantially realign each government\u2019s responsibilities, it said, which could prove counterproductive, but a new process to coordinate funding was needed. The commission conceded it would be \u201cchallenging\u201d and would require long term commitment and leadership from the governments, suggesting the children\u2019s commission provide external oversight to help \u201cembed incentives\u201d to follow through. The draft report was released in order for the community to provide feedback on the recommendations, before the commission finalised them and delivered them to government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
