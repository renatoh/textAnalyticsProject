Chelsea secured only a second Premier League win in six matches, overcoming stubborn and organised opponents who had merited their half-time advantage and had dared to dream of a first win here in 30 years until a madcap and cruel two-minute period with full-time in sight. The hosts' huddle on the final whistle, with Didier Drogba delivering the post-match rallying cry at its hub, was conducted with this ground exultant in relief. A five-point advantage has been re-established at the top where, for over an hour, they had trembled at the prospect that their lead might be lost before the turn of the year. \"I think that with this victory and this performance we have finished this difficult moment,\" said Carlo Ancelotti. \"It could prove to be one of the most important victories we have in the season. I'm very happy with the reaction of my team: we played together, not as individuals. December hasn't been good to us but it's over now. We have to look forward to January now. We know we can do better and maintain our position at the top of the table. But I'm happy with the way my first six months have gone.\" The Italian would have shivered at the prospect of losing his unbeaten home record while Mourinho, sitting in Roman Abramovich's executive box high up in the West Stand, had been looking on. The pair will renew their fractious relationship, the antipathy cultivated in Serie A last term, when Internazionale and Chelsea meet in the Champions League in late February. This was one of Mourinho's last opportunities to scout the London side's first team, with Drogba, Salomon Kalou and Mikel John Obi en route to the African Cup of Nations. For a while, his mere presence had felt off-putting. The home support cheered him as his image flashed up on the big screens before kick-off, a reaction given greater poignancy when the players departed at the break to a chorus of boos and frustration mounting. Ancelotti needed to inspire a riposte here with a switch to 4-1-4-1 \u2013 with the emphasis on greater width \u2013 and the influence of his substitutes timely. His Mourinho-esque tinkering paid dividends. \"I saw the difficulties in the first half,\" said Ancelotti. \"We were playing slowly, with more concentration in midfield. We had to play in the wide areas. Second half was different because I put Kalou and Joe Cole wide. We put more pressure on Fulham in midfield and played with more determination. There was a different spirit. \"I knew Mourinho was here watching the game but I didn't speak with him. I don't know if he'll have been happy with what he saw. I think Chelsea showed very good things but also some things that weren't so good. We played too much through the middle, not wide enough, so it had been easy for Fulham to control our play. But we've been in a difficult period \u2013 losing some physical condition \u2013 and we only play one game per week in January which will allow us to recover. The most important thing today was the reaction.\" The defeat was harsh on Fulham, who had worked feverishly to contain Chelsea's threat until undone by Drogba's booming header at the far post. They will scan John Paintsil's knee, with the full-back likely to be ruled out of the African Cup of Nations if it reveals ligament damage. \"I'm not trying to keep him out of the tournament,\" said Roy Hodgson. \"I'm more concerned that he might miss the rest of the season, which is always a danger with a twisted knee. \"I don't know about feeling hard done by. The disappointment is that such a hard-working performance, with my team showing so many good things, ends up without offering any reward.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
