I certainly hadn't: I assumed it was the French town responsible for that delicious combination of vanilla ice cream, hot chocolate and Chantilly cream, the chocolat li\u00e9geois. But then, I was also pretty certain that the author of the Maigret detective novels, Georges Simenon, was French. I was wrong about both. Chocolat li\u00e9geois originally came from Vienna - it was renamed for political reasons in 1919 - and Simenon was born in Belgium. As Le Monde pointed out on February 13, the hundredth anniversary of Simenon's birth, the writer left his reporting job at the Li\u00e8ge Gazette at the age of 19 and returned to the city only once to visit his mother. (He didn't stay long: several residents thought they recognised themselves in a semi-autobiographical novel he'd just published and promptly tried to sue him.) He spent much of the 1920s turning out dreadful potboilers with titles like Orgies Bourgeoises and Baisers Mortels (Deadly Kisses): he wrote for the long-defunct Paris-Flirt, slept with the jazz singer Josephine Baker, toured France in a canal boat and, in 1929, invented the character that would make his name: Inspector Maigret. Still, Li\u00e8ge doesn't begrudge the loss of its most famous son, and is keen to remind visitors that Simenon never renounced his Belgian citizenship. The town is hosting a lavish exhibition commemorating his life and work. Produced by the designers of J'aime pas la Culture, a big, casually ambitious homage to the 20th century which attracted rave reviews when it opened in Paris, Simenon... un si\u00e8cle! is a disorienting experience. It's the sort of exhibition that has visitors backtracking and revisiting sections, certain they missed something important. The first thing to strike you is the sloping wooden floor. Is this really finished? Has someone lost the spirit level? I wondered. In fact, the tilting floorboards and corridors are intended to evoke an ocean liner, and the cabins leading off them belong to Simenon's Surrealist contemporaries. There's a lovingly detailed mock-up of Maigret's office on the quai des Orf\u00e8vres in Paris, too, but also Philip Marlowe's bureau, 221b Baker Street and Hercule Poirot's compartment on the Orient Express. Of course, there are cases of vintage book jackets and photographs of Simenon and his mistresses. (He famously boasted to Fellini of having slept with 10,000 women.) If that bores you, listen to the novels through the banks of headphones, or watch the screen versions of Three Rooms in Manhattan and The Cat being filmed. The overall effect is evocative, but slightly perplexing - a bit like finishing a Maigret novel, in fact. We followed the exhibition with lunch at a nearby brasserie, As Ouhes. Li\u00e8ge may be in French-speaking Wallonia, but the town is wedged close to the German and Dutch borders, reflected in the food. It's indelicate and unsophisticated: fatty bacon quiche, veal marrowbone, smoked fish and a remarkably sticky rum baba were served up, none outstanding, all decidedly edible. (Meatballs are a local speciality, as is a thoroughly nasty juniper spirit and a concentrated juice of apples and pears, known as sirop de Li\u00e8ge.) The mirrored and panelled interior and the quiet opulence of the place are what make the modest bill worthwhile. Like much of Li\u00e8ge, As Ouhes is a throwback to an older, more sombre Europe. It is just that quality that makes this provincial, unshowy and sometimes dingy town a real curiosity. Beyond the pedestrianised streets of the main shopping district, Le Carr\u00e9, lies a maze of streets of the kind which have virtually disappeared from Britain: dusty-windowed, zinc-countered cafes selling obscure brands of Belgian beer, alleyways too narrow to walk two abreast, and 1950s shop fronts with their wares laid out carefully in the window. Boutiques promise the latest Modes. Many of the ironmongers and pawnbrokers display shopfronts that could easily date from the 1950s. Li\u00e8ge has no shortage of chocolate shops, but the one I chose was Galler in the rue du Pot d'Or, where a ribbon-tied box of couple of dozen nougats, caramels and truffles costs seven euros (just under \u00a35). The temperature was seven degrees under when I visited and it was a crisp, sunny day - ideal conditions for tackling the 430 steps up the Montagne de Bueren. The view from the Parc de la Citadelle at the top is spectacular, but you can break the climb and enjoy a similar view by turning left at the bottom of the stairs and taking the sentier des Coteaux. This is Li\u00e8ge at its most impressive. Screw up your eyes, block out the 70s blocks afflicting the view, and you could almost be in Dijon. On the bank of the Meuse our guide paused, slightly embarrassed, opposite the Passarelle bridge. \"This is where men went to see women and drink. And they do still,\" she explained. We peered down a rundown alley where a couple of neon lights were blinking optimistically. There were no women to be seen. On the other hand, there were no men either. \"I don't understand,\" one member of our party ventured. This, it emerged, was Li\u00e8ge's \"red lighted district\", and it was in a very similar street across the river Meuse, rue Capitaine, that Simenon first encountered a prostitute. As the tourist board's leaflet puts it: \"On his way back from school, the young Simenon used to go along this street with a thumping heart where he saw women on the game installed behind their net curtains. One evening, with a very strong desire, he hesitated... And then, to his shame, he paid with a watch that his father had given to him. Something that, afterwards, he was bitterly to regret.\" The Outremeuse district was where Simenon grew up, and he plundered it later on for Maigret material - notably the suicide of a friend, a would-be artist and cocaine addict called Joseph Kleine, who appears in Maigret and the Hundred Gibbets. Kleine hanged himself from the door of St-Pholien church with a scarf, a scene Simenon borrows for his novel. Like most of the Maigret novels, The Hanged Man is out of print in English, although the green-jacketed early editions are easy to find in secondhand bookshops. Penguin is publishing new translations later this year. It's as good a way as any to pass the journey from Waterloo to Li\u00e8ge, which takes just over five hours. If you can afford a business class ticket, so much the better. Any delay at Brussels will permit a visit to the Philippe Starck-designed Eurostar lounge, with its retro orange swivelling armchairs. Li\u00e8ge is no jewel. It will never rival the Nordic chic of Stockholm or the charm of Munich. But it won't rip you off, the rose and trinket hawkers found in so many French and Italian cities are unheard of, and the city itself offers a glimpse of mid-century Europe: a few streets where it is still possible to imagine a murder inquiry led by a pipe-smoking detective, and solved without the help of DNA samples and CCTV. Getting there \u00b7 Eurostar operates up to eight trains per day to Brussels, with fares starting from \u00a359 return in Standard Class. Call 08705 186 186 or click on Eurostar for more details and to make a reservation. The journey to Brussels, which takes you from the heart of London right into the centre of the EU capital, takes two hours and 40 minutes. \u00b7 Contact Rail Europe for all bookings by Eurostar to destinations \"beyond\" (also known as Eurostar Plus), Inter-Rail and other rail passes, Motorail, in fact any rail journey on the Continent, tel: 08705 848 848 or visit website. \u00b7 For more information on Brussels and all destinations in Wallonia, including Li\u00e8ge, please contact the Belgian Tourist Office - Brussels &amp; Wallonia on tel: 020 7531 0390 or email: info@belgiumtheplaceto.be. Alternatively, click on to their website. \u00b7 Simenon... un si\u00e8cle! runs until September 30 at the Espace Tivoli. Entry costs 9 euros. A guided tour of Simenon's Li\u00e8ge can be arranged by the tourist office and costs 8 euros."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
