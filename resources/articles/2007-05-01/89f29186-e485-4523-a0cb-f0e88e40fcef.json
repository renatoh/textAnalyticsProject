The ISC was asked to reopen their investigation into the 2005 bombings after it emerged last week that bomber Mohammed Sidique Khan, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, had been on the periphery of the fertiliser bomb plot which saw five men receive life sentences for planning a terrorist campaign. Khan was filmed meeting the leader of the fertiliser bomb plot, Omar Khyam, at a service station in February 2004. A senior counter-terrorism source told The Observer that evidence to be supplied to the ISC would show the West Yorkshire force had been asked to make follow-up inquiries about Khan but the request was never followed through. 'When push comes to shove, evidence will be presented that a request was sent to West Yorkshire police asking them to make further inquiries about Khan,' the source said. West Yorkshire police is said to have no record of the request. But MI5 does not want to blame the police. A security service source told The Observer that further checks on Khan were not considered a priority because he was deemed to be a 'petty fraudster' with no interest in domestic terrorism and that even if there had been further investigations it is doubtful as to whether this would have altered its evaluation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
