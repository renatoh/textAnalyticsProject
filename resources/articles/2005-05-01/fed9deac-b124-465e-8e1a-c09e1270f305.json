The director gives it a real visual punch at times but at the centre you have a vacuum - not only are the songs as bland and unmemorable as you'd expect, but this must be the most unscary Phantom of all time. He starts with the neat, white half-face mask that Michael Crawford wore for so long in the West End. When he removes it - shock, horror! The other half is slightly less perfect than the half we've already seen. The part needs a sadomasochistic weirdo in the Vincent Price tradition. It gets Gerard Butler, who has played Dracula and Attila, but comes over about as scary here as Charles Hawtrey. Musically, it's all a bit Rick Wakeman on ice; neither does it have a star to carry it, as Madonna tried to do in Evita - though Minnie Driver provides a very enjoyable diva turn as La Carlotta. It confirms my view that anything with \"opera\" in the title should be avoided, unless Jerry Springer or the Marx Brothers are also on hand. And there's nothing here to match I'm Packing My Trunk from Richard Curtis's spoof Lloyd Webber/Elephant Man musical Elephant! in The Tall Guy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
