The MP for Tatton, who becomes second lord of the Treasury within a fortnight of his 39th birthday, will have the unenviable task of trying to convince the City that he is up to the job. Rumours late this afternoon that Kenneth Clarke was to return to the role he performed between 1993 and 1997 was greeted with enthusiasm in the markets, which were keen to see an experienced face supporting a young prime minister. The new chancellor is unable to say, as Clarke could, that he has steered an economy back to growth after a grinding recession and taken unpopular decisions to slash the budget deficit. Nor does he have the benefits of the landslide majority and fast-growing economy that Gordon Brown inherited back in 1997. Instead, Osborne has the reputation of a exceptionally bright young politician who combines moments of brilliance with episodes that have made him seem like a liability to David Cameron. On the plus side, the Conservatives would not now be back in government had it not been for Osborne's announcement at the party conference in October 2007 that he was to raise the threshold for inheritance tax to \u00a31m. Up until that point, Brown had been planning to hold a snap election that the opinion polls suggested he would have won. Brown got cold feet \u2013 and was nicknamed 'Bottler Brown' in the rightwing press \u2013 after the positive response to Osborne's initiative. He never really recovered from the election that never was. Less favourable headlines, however, surrounded reports of Osborne's meetings with Oleg Deripaska on the Russian oligarch's yacht in the summer of 2008, while the shadow chancellor's performance during the three-year financial crisis has been mixed. Treasury officials have prepared a full in-tray for the successor to Alistair Darling, a politician seen as having had a \"good crisis\". Reform of the banking sector and abolition of the Financial Services Authority are key issues, but none is as pressing as the need to start work on the budget the Tories have pledged to hold within 50 days. This will begin the process of cutting Britain's record peacetime deficit. If Osborne cuts too much, too soon, there is a risk that the country would be pushed back into recession. If he leaves it too late, the ratings agencies may worry about the commitment of the coalition to get to grips with the problems."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
