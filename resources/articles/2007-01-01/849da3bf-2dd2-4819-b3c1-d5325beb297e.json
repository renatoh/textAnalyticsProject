Julie Bradley became headteacher of St Leonard's primary school, near Burnley, in 2000. She immediately noticed that her pupils seemed to lack vitality and stamina and, together with her staff, set about improving things. As a devoted fan of Burnley FC, she knew that physical education and sport could help her pupils find a new focus. Now the timetable has been rejigged so that that every moment of the school day is used, with a rhythm of energetic and quiet times. Regular breaks for classroom aerobics and mental gymnastics help keep pupils alert and focused on their work, and the school puts PE high on the agenda. Provision of food and drink has also been addressed, with water bottles standard for all pupils and healthy eating at breakfast time, snack time and lunch time. All the hard work is now paying off in the children's improved energy and self-esteem, not to mention a shared passion for Burnley FC.
