Should TerraMax complete the 132-mile course, it will join the four robots to have met part of the Pentagon's challenge: to negotiate, unaided, a man-made obstacle course across the desert. But TerraMax will have failed in the other part of the challenge: to finish in less than 10 hours. The robot vehicles were competing in a Pentagon-sponsored competition funded by the taxpayer with a prize of $2m (\u00a31.3m) for the fastest robot to perform within the timeframe. The prize was expected to go to a team whose Volkswagen, named Stanley, completed the course in less than seven and a half hours on Saturday. While the US military uses some robot vehicles in Afghanistan and Iraq, they have to be remotely controlled by a nearby human. The hope is to develop vehicles capable of delivering supplies and performing other duties without the oversight of a human, with the ultimate aim to comply with a congressional mandate to have a third of all military ground vehicles unmanned by 2015. Last year none of the teams completed the challenge. The course this year was tougher: as well as ravines and a dry lake bed, the vehicles had to go through three tunnels designed to knock out their satellite positioning equipment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
