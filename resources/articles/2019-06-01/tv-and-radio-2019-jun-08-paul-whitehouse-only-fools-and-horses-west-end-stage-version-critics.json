While these shows are rarely awarded top marks by the critics, some do occasionally strike a valuable seam, selling out and pulling in audiences from across the country. One such hit is Only Fools and Horses, which in spite of half-hearted praise in early reviews is doing such a roaring trade that it is listed near the top on most ticket websites, alongside Les Mis\u00e9rables, Matilda and Hamilton. For the comedian Paul Whitehouse, who co-wrote the show and appears in it as Grandad, the success is a joy, but also a source of wry amusement. \u201cI know that some people have been sneery,\u201d he said this weekend. \u201cBut I have been around too long to care. It is not a \u2018classic\u2019, but it is not meant to be Sondheim \u2013 and in fact I would rather see this than Sondheim.\u201d Even the sniffier critics have agreed the cast is excellent and the mood infectious, but the show\u2019s main victory has been at the box office. Whitehouse freely acknowledges this is largely down to the great love the public still feels for the original BBC sitcom, which ran for 20 years and was written by the late John Sullivan. \u201cOld neighbour of mine, a banker, saw it the other day and had a tear in his eye,\u201d said Whitehouse. \u201cPeople come with differing expectations. Some want to see the show they loved recreated and others just come out of curiosity. Audiences have lots of different motivations, but what they don\u2019t realise till they are in the theatre is that they will be seeing a distillation of the whole of the Only Fools story. That is slightly unexpected, I think, and may be why some feel moved.\u201d Whitehouse said the comedian Ricky Gervais has even broken his rule of never seeing a musical \u2013 and liked it. And Whitehouse\u2019s partner on the riverbank, fellow fishing enthusiast Bob Mortimer, also loved it. \u201cI think at first he was secretly hoping my knees were going to give way during one of the dances, but then he enjoyed it.\u201d On Friday, the strength of national feeling for the original show was underlined when a sale of TV props, including Del Boy\u2019s flashy jewellery, drew unexpected interest. A script from Heroes and Villains, the episode in which Del Boy and Rodney dress up as Batman and Robin, went for more than \u00a34,000. But Whitehouse does not believe he was shooting at an open goal. He and Sullivan\u2019s son, Jim, approached the project with caution, and he gives a lot of credit to \u201cbrilliant\u201d music director Stuart Morley, who arranged the songs, which Whitehouse worked on with the late Chas Hodges of Chas &amp; Dave. The director, CJ Ranger, also knocked the story into shape, he says. \u201cI genuinely don\u2019t care what musical theatre critics on broadsheet papers say about it now. I don\u2019t have to. Maybe I would if it had not been such a hit,\u201d Whitehouse said. \u201cI understand that theatre writers have to look at it from an esoteric point of view and don\u2019t care so much about bums on seats, and that is fair enough. I also suppose I am viewed as a bit of a johnny-come-lately.\u201d When the notion of developing the show was put to Whitehouse, he was unsure. \u201cI didn\u2019t jump at it,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, this is a sitcom held in such affection I still sometimes wake up some nights in a cold sweat. I have conversations with myself asking why I\u2019ve mucked it about. But the answer I give myself is a good one: I say that John Sullivan started this. He began writing it before he died.\u201d The writer\u2019s son suggested using a favourite episode about a dating bureau as the heart of the plot, introducing Del Boy to his great love, Raquel. Whitehouse\u2019s two first ideas were a song about the cockney exodus from London and a scene projecting into London\u2019s future. \u201cIt was a good idea to set it back in 1989, but we needed to look forward as well. This was the way to make it more than an exercise in nostalgia.\u201d And there is little of the grandeur of a traditional musical experience: \u201cFairly early on, we break the \u2018fourth wall\u2019, as I believe theatre people call it, and talk to our audience. I want to do it all the time, of course, because of my comedy background. But we have to stick to the script because there are specific things that need to happen on time with the revolving stage. We wanted quick scene changes between the Trotters\u2019 flat and the pub, so it keeps a bit of the feel of the television show.\u201d Most crucial for Whitehouse is the performance of Tom Bennett as Del Boy, which has to convey the burden of the sentiment. \u201cI watch Tom every night in awe. There needs to be that heart. Under the veneer Del Boy has done quite a lot for his family. And Rodney is key \u2013 perhaps the more complex because he is the most grown-up.\u201d Rather like beloved music-hall turns, the Trotter brothers are welcomed with shrieks of appreciation each night as they deliver their catchphrases, newly polished up for resale. Whitehouse is to step down from his role later in the run, but only temporarily. He wants to \u201crekindle\u201d his relationships with his established comedy partners Harry Enfield and Charlie Higson, but promises to be back. As for the lukewarm critical reception \u2013 well, as Del Boy says in the show, \u201cthat is all epidemic now\u201d, because Whitehouse has helped Sullivan\u2019s last wish come true."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
