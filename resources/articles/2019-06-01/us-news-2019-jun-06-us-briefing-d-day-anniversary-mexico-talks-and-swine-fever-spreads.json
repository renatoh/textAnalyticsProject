Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. World leaders join D-day veterans to mark 75th anniversary Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron were among the world leaders gathering in Normandy on Thursday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the D-day landings. The allied veterans who joined them there included the British former soldiers John \u201cJock\u201d Hutton, 94, and 95-year-old Harry Read, both of whom parachuted into France in the early hours of 6 June 1944.

The discussions are focused on migration, with the White House demanding Mexico do more to stem the flow of migrants across its border into the US. Mexico\u2019s foreign minister said on Wednesday that \u201cboth sides recognize the current situation cannot continue\u201d. Migrant numbers. The number of arrests by US Border Patrol at the border with Mexico hit its highest level since 2007 in May, as officials warned they lacked sufficient resources to care for the surge of parents and children entering the US. Millions of Asian pigs culled amid swine fever epidemic South-east Asia is battling to contain what experts say is the world\u2019s biggest ever animal disease outbreak, an epidemic of African swine fever that was discovered in August and has already led to millions of pigs being culled in China and Vietnam. There is no vaccination for the disease, known as \u201cpig Ebola\u201d, which is highly contagious and fatal for pigs, albeit harmless to humans. Regional crisis. Pig farms in Cambodia have already been devastated by the outbreak, with cases on the rise in Mongolia, North Korea and Hong Kong. Thailand, Asia\u2019s second-biggest pork producer, is on \u201cred alert\u201d. Toronto urged to abandon Google \u2018smart city\u2019 project Roger McNamee was an early investor in Google and Facebook, and has since grown sceptical of the tech giants over their handling of user privacy concerns. This week, he warned that Google could not be trusted with the data it would collect on residents of the proposed 12-acre Quayside development in Toronto, a controversial so-called \u201csmart city\u201d being built by the city in partnership with Google\u2019s Sidewalk Labs. In a letter to the Toronto city council, McNamee described the project as \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d. Facial recognition. Privacy activists have launched a new tool to help travellers avoid flying with airlines that use facial recognition technology in airports, including JetBlue, Delta and American Airlines.

The UN has warned that more than 2 million people are at risk of starvation in Somalia this summer unless the international community takes urgent steps to respond to a drought caused by one of the region\u2019s driest rainy seasons in decades. The US Department of Energy has announced plans to reclassify some of the nation\u2019s most radioactive nuclear waste \u2013 found in South Carolina, Idaho and Washington state \u2013 by lowering its threat level to save $40bn in cleanup costs. Must-reads Why Stacey Abrams isn\u2019t running \u2013 yet Her dramatic run for governor in deep red Georgia last November may have ended in defeat \u2013 just \u2013 but it earned Stacey Abrams the admiration of Democrats across the country. She tells Lucia Graves why she\u2019s still weighing whether to enter the presidential race. The evils of bad economics Inequality is rising in most of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries, and we have been led to believe that it\u2019s inevitable. In fact, explains Jonathan Aldred, it is a direct result of economic arguments that emerged from the US and UK in the 1980s. And the trend will only continue if we fail to make a counterargument. The best smaller films to see this summer There are plenty of superhero sequels coming to movie theatres this summer, but look beyond the multiplex and you will find plenty of smaller cinematic gems, says Benjamin Lee, from a Jim Jarmusch zombie comedy to an acclaimed documentary about China\u2019s one-child policy. Kirk Weddle: the man behind Nirvana\u2019s swimming baby Kirk Weddle had marketed himself as an underwater photographer, which is why a record label approached him in 1991 about the shoot for its latest album cover: a baby swimming naked towards a dollar on a fishhook. He looks back on the iconic image he captured for Nirvana\u2019s Nevermind. Opinion The onus of birth control has always fallen on women, but with access to abortion and even contraception under threat, it\u2019s finally time for men to share that responsibility, says Moira Donegan.

It is morally unacceptable.
