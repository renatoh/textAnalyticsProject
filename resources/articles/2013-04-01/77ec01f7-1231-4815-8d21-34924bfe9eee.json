In a typically eccentric instalment of his weekly column for the Radio Times, which Mair largely devotes to fictitious claims about particle physics, mockery of the magazine's editor and worries about the size of his own bald spot, he says he has no ambitions to move from his current job presenting Radio 4's PM on weekday afternoons. Last Sunday Mair won plaudits while filling in on Andrew Marr's eponymous Sunday morning BBC1 show for grilling Johnson on his dismissal from the Times for making up quotes and lying about an affair, But Mair insisted he did not want Marr's job permanently, or that of Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight, or John Humphrys' place on Radio 4's flagship news show Today. He wrote: \"As for all the hullaballoo \u2026 for the record, I don't want Jeremy's job. Or John's. Or Andrew's. I like mine.\" Typically, this protestation was then undermined by a joke: \"Though my contract is up soon and I haven't heard anything, so if you run a radio or TV station and you think there's a future for a 47-year-old in a bad wig \u2013 call my agent.\" Mair's polite but relentless inquisition of Johnson brought him considerable praise, even from the London mayor himself who said his interviewer had done \"a splendid job\", followed by considerable speculation the BBC could move Mair to a more prominent role. After a long diversion about the Higgs Boson particle and a surreal description of the Radio Times's editor, Ben Preston \u2013 who smells, Mair wrote, \"of Pimms and regret\", and speaks like \"a cross between Mike Reid and Arthur Mullard\" \u2013 Mair addressed his newfound celebrity. He wrote: \"One of the joys of live broadcasting is that you never have to hear or see your work unless you really go out of your way. You prepare it, do it, then head to the bar. Well, that's usually the order. But last week there was, for a moment, no avoiding screengrabs and clips of the eminent and likeable Boris Johnson being badgered by a balding sack of potatoes in a cheap suit. Yes, balding. And not the nice Clare kind. \"Never mind all the stuff about what the interview revealed. The photos revealed something very shocking to me. What in my mind was my discreet but manageable bald spot is in fact the size of a dinner plate. Only the over-the-shoulder TV camera angle could tell me this and, what's worse, it was then relayed in every newspaper in the land. \"I could play a monk in a low-budget TV movie. You could sell advertising space on it (note to self: check with BBC lawyers whether this might be do-able for my next Marr stand-in).\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
