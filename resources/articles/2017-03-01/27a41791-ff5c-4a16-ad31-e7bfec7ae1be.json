The problems were caused by damage to overhead electric wires between Retford and Newark North Gate early on Thursday afternoon. Services operated by Virgin Trains East Coast between Edinburgh, Newcastle, York, Leeds and London Kings Cross have been affected, along with those run by Grand Central between Sunderland/Bradford and King\u2019s Cross, and Hull Trains to London. Further information about the disruption is available on the Network Rail website. Virgin Trains has advised customers to avoid travelling and said that tickets would be valid on services on Friday. The delays meant that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, was unable to reach Sunderland to appear on BBC1\u2019s Question Time on Thursday night. It remains unclear whether Virgin services will operate as normal on Friday. The problems resulted in very lengthy journeys for some passengers on services from King\u2019s Cross on Thursday. Some passengers complained on Twitter that power lines on this section of the east coast mainline were often damaged."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
