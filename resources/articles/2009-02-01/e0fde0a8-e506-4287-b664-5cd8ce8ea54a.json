It was with this definition that Robin Knowles QC began his talk on the rise in Islamophobia at the Muslim Safety Forum's session at the Convention on Modern Liberty. Knowles concluded the session by presenting a gentle approach to tackling this fear through measures as simple as sitting down to a meal together with \"foreign\" people in order to understand them. This was a refreshing approach, particularly after the previous speakers detailed incidents of discrimination and bias on behalf of a government only interested in Muslim integration in the context of terrorism and radicalisation and not for its own sake. The Jewish academic Edie Friedman made some interesting comparisons between the Jewish and Muslim experiences. She added that even well-established and integrated communities such as the Jewish community suffer especially when there is an event, such as the recent incursion into Gaza, that could give rise to anti-Semitism. She called for a campaign to combat all racism under a human rights agenda and move beyond perpetual victimhood. While this is an admirable mission, however, she rather conflated race, identity and religion. Perhaps the most important point was raised by academic Stuart Wilks-Heeg, who made the vital link between prejudice and economics. A riveting statistic he apparently uncovered during his research was that the three most active BNP areas in the United Kingdom were the only three locations where employment fell in the boom years prior to the credit crunch. This is possibly the most illuminating angle, for social exclusion, stereotyping and dehumanisation, whether it is directed towards white working class single mothers or Muslims, is a function of their wider alienation from mainstream society. The predication on identity stymies the debate and fragments vision. Having said that, Muslims themselves sometimes do not acknowledge how covetously preserving their identity could further entrench alienation. A question from the audience regarding faith schools was met with a dismissive answer from Tufyal Choudhury and Ifath Nawaz: it was allegedly a red herring and there was no evidence whatsoever to prove that faith schools hamper integration and feed xenophobia. They both went on to admit however, when challenged, that this was an observation not based on any research or study. Sunny Hundal asked a question that I think was on everybody's mind at the conclusion of the session. We know what the problems are, but what are the solutions? I was looking forward to some tangible suggestions, especially from the Muslims on the panel, but it seemed that all the solutions were exogneous to the Muslim community. Tackling macro socio-economic issues, for example, and an optimistic plea to the media to stop sensationalising and over-exposing coverage of Muslim issues. I was about to make the point that these seemd rather passive solutions but there commenced a short presentation about the Islam is Peace campaign. This looks promising, I thought. A \"not in my name\" movement, the organisation attempts to promote understanding by taking out adverts \u2013 in the national press and, soon, on the sides of buses \u2013 stating that \"Islam is Peace\", in the ultimate hope of reclaiming British Muslim identity from the extremists. While this is an admirable campaign that takes the intitiative, I am not sure as to how far it can go to address the serious practical problems facing Muslims in Britain today. The chair concluded the session with Edmund Burke's \"all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing\". Perhaps what is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do too little. \u2022 See more on the convention and civil liberties at liberty central"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
