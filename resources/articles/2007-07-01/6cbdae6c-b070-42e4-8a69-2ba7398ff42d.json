In this she differs somewhat from her 'ard-as-nails predecessor, Dr John Reid, who during last summer's terrorist drama - you know, the deadly exploding liquids on transatlantic planes one - refused point blank to leave his office and insisted on spending the night there in a sleeping bag. In vain, we hear, did Home Office officials protest that his London flat was mere yards away from the department's brand new HQ in Marsham Street; that they could wake him in an emergency (as they have done home secretaries for 200 years and more); that he could be back in the office in minutes. No, Camper John's mind was made up. And we, for one, slept all the more soundly for his sacrifice! \u00b7 We are indebted to indefatigable animal counter-terrorism expert Thomas Yocum, next, for the immensely reassuring news that there exists a Squirrel Defamation League whose unambiguous motto (we quote) is \"All Squirrels Must Die\". Fine work. \u00b7 The Norwich Evening News, meanwhile, reports that Great Yarmouth Sea Life centre has decided to name its newly arrived South American snapping turtle Prescott. Described as \"a tropical variety with a vicious bite and a temper to match\", the beast was apparently \"found by someone cleaning debris from a lake, where we think he'd been surreptitiously dumped by his former owner\", explained the centre's Claire Little. \"Being a northeastern lass and a graduate of Hull university, I instantly thought of the former deputy prime minister.\" As you would. \u00b7 What is it about would-be Tory mayors of London? Archer, Norris, (maybe) Johnson: any connection? Is an overactive libido a requirement or something? (Mind you, Bozza's acceptance speech would be a laugh. \"Crikey, look, let me, um, apologise right now for any offence I will immediately cause ...\") \u00b7 Who, in August 2006, wrote to Hizb ut-Tahrir that he was \"very grateful for your comments on relations between western governments and the Muslim world\", which had been \"fully taken on board\"? Why, the boy Cameron, of course, who on Wednesday repeatedly demanded to know why the Broon hadn't yet banned the group. \u00b7 Earlier this week, you may recall, this column was most impressed by the Kohler C3 toilet seat, with \"cleansing wands; heated seat with three temperature settings; warm-air fan; lighted bowl; deodorizer; Quiet-Close seat and full remote control\". Today it is amazed by the Dutch-made Clean Seat Matic with Automatic Infrared-Activated Voice Chip, which not only lines itself with paper but reminds users (in several languages) to flush it and broadcasts up to three minutes of recorded advertisements. Unbelievable. \u00b7 Off to a good start, then, the Government of all the Talents, what with that spat in the Lords over new trade minister Sir Digby \"Take No Prisoners\" Jones and his siren call for \"more competitive\" corporation tax. But that may be as nothing, we fear, compared to the feud that now looms at the department for business between Sir Diggers (Desert Island Discs top three: Nimrod, Jerusalem and, um, Simply the Best by Tina Turner) and energy minister Malcolm Wicks, who respects the former CBI director so much he publicly accused him of \"scaremongering\" and \"talking nonsense\" less than two years ago. Sparks, as it were, may fly! \u00b7 That's Rudy Giuliani's presidential bid over. The New York Post reckons his third wife, Judi, once helped sell surgical staples for US Surgical, a job that entailed her demonstrating their efficacy on cuts made in drugged dogs, which were then either put down or simply died. Kind of news that'll play really well in middle America. \u00b7 In further foreign news, finally, we hear St Tony has accepted an invitation to address French pres Nicolas Sarkozy's centre-right UMP party at their autumn conference on the subject of \"implementing change\".
