Davis's nephew confirmed this week that Cheadle will also play the jazz pioneer, while Herbie Hancock is in talks to provide the score (I'm not sure why they don't just use Davis's music, but never mind). Let's hope we don't have to wait as long for this project as for the Nina Simone story, in the offing since 2005 and still not due until 2012. Excitingly, Mary J Blige is set to play Simone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
