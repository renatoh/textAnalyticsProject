The company runs three smelters in Australia, which are under financial pressure due to the high price of electricity, which makes up about a third of their costs, and the low price of aluminium due to a flood of cheap supply coming from Asian competitors. The resources minister, Matt Canavan, has recently championed the industry, saying Australia was \u201cone of the best aluminium producers in the world\u201d and claiming it needed a continued supply of \u201ccheap baseload\u201d electricity from coal. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cIf we turn our back on coal, you turn out the lights on aluminium, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d he told ABC Radio last week. However, speaking in London on Thursday night, the chief executive of Rio Tinto\u2019s aluminium division, Alf Barrios, issued a blunt warning that current prices from coal-fired power were too high. He said this was despite \u201cfantastic work\u201d done by the team at the Australian smelter division, Pacific, to improve the performance of the plants. \u201cHowever power accounts for about a third of the global cost of the smelters and the smelters at Pacific do lack internationally competitive energy prices, which undermines the viability of these assets,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working very closely with the power suppliers and the governments to find a solution to this challenge. \u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate on the outcome but clearly the current situation is not sustainable.\u201d The warning comes after Rio Tinto boss Jean-Sebastian Jacques warned in August that Australian smelters were \u201con thin ice\u201d and follows the company flagging last week that it might close its New Zealand smelter. Barrios was speaking to reporters ahead of a quarterly update to investors that listed \u201clow-carbon technology\u201d as a priority for its aluminium business. The company\u2019s head of economics, Vivek Tulpule, said the profitability of aluminium was \u201cchallenged by the quick and cheap expansion of supply to meet growth in demand\u201d. \u201cThis underlines the value of our position in Canada with operating costs in the bottom decile of the cost curve supported by hydro power which will become increasingly important in a carbon-constrained world,\u201d he said. The company is also exploring making greenhouse gas-free aluminium as part of a wider project to reduce its emissions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
