Cheerfully turning out low-budget shlockbusters, Corman emerges as the very incarnation of never-say-die American entrepreneurialism and capitalism, celebrating naughtiness, absurdity and fun. In the process, he has given a career start and an invaluable real-world film education to the likes of Jack Nicholson, Peter Bogdanovich, Joe Dante, Ron Howard and Martin Scorsese. For film theorists, his anarchic movies such as The Terror (1963) \u2013 which he put together just because he happened to have a creepy-looking set which he couldn't bear to go to waste \u2013 are exercises in pure, narrative-less cinema, a series of wacky effects and explosions and stabbings and screams. And yet his anti-racism movie The Intruder (1962) was challenging and courageous; it was precisely because Corman was not encumbered with middlebrow good taste that he was able to make it. The mainstream cinema industry was stuffed with well-meaning liberals who theoretically might have wished to make such a film, but only Corman had the can-do attitude. His teensploitation movies powered the 70s New Wave, inspiring Easy Rider, Jaws and Star Wars. Corman himself never quite graduated to their mega-star level, perhaps because he never wanted to concede control to corporate America and simply because anarchy was and is his vocation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
