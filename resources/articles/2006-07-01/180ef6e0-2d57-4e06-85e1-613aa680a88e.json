Her themes of love, loss and loneliness, are nothing new, and nor are the songs, written between 1990 and 2000. But Millan has never sounded more enchanting or as exposed, oozing resignation as she relinquishes her grip in Losing You, woozily sinking to the bottom of a glass in Pour Me Up. The warm bluegrass of Blue in Your Eye sounds like a Be Good Tanyas gem, while the rocky sensuality of Skinny Boy stems from her day job. Pop fans will think it's a country album, country purists will deem it pop and contributions from friends in both Stars and Broken Social Scene adds a conflicting rock slant. What's not in doubt is that Millan makes it work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
