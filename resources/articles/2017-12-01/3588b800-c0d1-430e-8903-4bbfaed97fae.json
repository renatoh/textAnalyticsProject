Pitt was dumped from his role of assistant trade minister, while Darren Chester lost the infrastructure portfolio in a reshuffle in which Joyce demoted Nationals who opposed his pick for deputy, Matt Canavan, who lost to Bridget McKenzie. The Australian Financial Review reported the move may have backfired, with Pitt reportedly telling colleagues he was considering his options and a possible move to the crossbench. Any defections could destabilise the Turnbull government, which only recently regained its majority of 76 seats in the lower house after the re-election of Joyce and John Alexander in byelections triggered by their dual citizenship. In a further sign of tension, McKenzie, the new Nationals deputy leader, has publicly contradicted Joyce\u2019s account that geographical representation was the reason Chester was demoted. Asked if he was confident Pitt would not quit, Joyce told Sky News on Wednesday: \u201cYes, I\u2019m confident that Keith has a great desire to do the very best for the people of Bundaberg. \u201cI know Keith is a person of immense talent and he will continue to work extremely hard for his constituency,\u201d he said. Joyce reiterated that the reason for Chester\u2019s demotion was that both he and McKenzie were Victorians and there was a need to increase the Queensland representation in cabinet. \u201cWe try to make sure a representation comes from the length and breadth of our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople completely understand in the game of politics and football sometimes you play first grade and times you don\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a reshuffle yet where I haven\u2019t found happy people and unhappy people, predominantly unhappy people \u2026 You have to be brave and committed enough to do them.\u201d On Tuesday McKenzie told Sky News \u201cthe whole argument about geography is ridiculous\u201d. She noted the Northern Territory had just one senator, Nigel Scullion, and he had remained in cabinet. \u201cIf it was about numbers, Nigel wouldn\u2019t be there. It\u2019s about merit.\u201d In reference to Pitt, McKenzie accepted he was a more senior Queensland candidate than David Littleproud, who was catapulted into cabinet despite having been in parliament just 18 months and never having held a ministry. But she said Joyce had wanted a \u201cmix of skills and experience\u201d. The deputy leader accepted that Joyce had the right to make \u201ca different decision about who is going to make up his ministerial team\u201d. McKenzie paid tribute to Chester, describing him as a \u201cclass act\u201d who was \u201crelentlessly positive and optimistic about regional Australia and the role that he can play in its growth and development\u201d. \u201cAt the end of the day the decision is made, we have to respect the decision and get on with it.\u201d On Wednesday the deputy opposition leader, Tanya Plibersek, said there were no plans for a reshuffle on the Labor side, telling ABC\u2019s AM the frontbench were \u201cfocused on their portfolios not themselves\u201d. Pibersek said the Coalition\u2019s reshuffle had \u201ccaused more problems than it\u2019s solved\u201d and showed members of the government were more focused on their own jobs than Australians\u2019. \u201cI think it\u2019s a typical sign of a government that\u2019s spiralling in chaos to have this sort of infighting breaking out just hours after these announcements were made.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
