Liverpool were dominant virtually from start to finish at Anfield, although they did allow Alexandre Lacazette a soft opener and the same player missed a glorious chance to equalise after the hour. Klopp was thrilled with a third successsive victory in their title defence and praised a consummate all-round display. \u201cIt was a really good game, I loved pretty much each second,\u201d he said, making an exception for Lacazette\u2019s goal. \u201cAgainst a top team in form, playing like we did tonight is something, to be honest. \u201cThe way we played, I liked a lot. We looked pretty ruthless and kept them within 25 metres in front of their goal. Each ball you lose is a potential counterattack; everyone knows the speed they have. It takes a proper mix between being brave, flexible, direct and being perfectly protected.\u201d Within minutes of full-time Klopp had crossed swords with Keane, overhearing the former Manchester United captain\u2019s description of his team as \u201csloppy on one or two occasions at the back\u201d as he prepared to come on air. \u201cDid I hear right that Mr Keane said we had a sloppy performance tonight, because I could hear you already? Did he say that?\u201d Klopp asked. \u201cThis was a sloppy performance tonight? Maybe he spoke about another game. It cannot be this game, sorry. That\u2019s an incredible description. This was absolutely exceptional. Nothing was sloppy, absolutely nothing.\u201d Keane had in fact heaped praise on Liverpool\u2019s performance and Klopp had not heard the full context, something he was happy to admit later. \u201cYou cannot defend [against] Arsenal for 90 minutes with the quality they have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely normal they have chances.\u201d Mikel Arteta said Liverpool have \u201cset the bar probably to the best standard the Premier League has seen in many years\u201d and was pleased his players had been \u201cupset and angry\u201d to lose. He suggested Arsenal, who have had a \u00a335m bid rejected for the Lyon playmaker Houssem Aouar, may be involved in a final week of the transfer window that will be \u201creally busy for all the clubs\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
