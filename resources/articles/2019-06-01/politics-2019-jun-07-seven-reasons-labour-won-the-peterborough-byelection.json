Labour\u2019s ruthless campaign for the recall of Fiona Onasanya After Peterborough\u2019s Labour MP, Fiona Onasanya, was found guilty in December of perverting the course of justice, Labour HQ decided the party should be seen by local voters to be at the forefront of any campaign to eject her from office. Despite her continuing loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn, there was no sentimentality, and a focus on securing a next MP in the swing seat. Corbyn issued a statement calling for his one-time party whip to stand down. In January, two full-time party workers were assigned to the city. The ground war had begun. 2. An already impressive Labour database became even better Labour knows its voters across the city, having fought the 2015 and 2017 general elections against a well-oiled Conservative machine led by Stewart Jackson. The recall campaign was used to fine-tune its knowledge of individual streets, which were then assigned to specific councillors and activists. One councillor told the Guardian he had visited one road four times before the end of May, and one activist said they had knocked on some doors up to nine times on polling day to get the vote out. 3. Postal votes Labour realised its core supporters might suffer from voter fatigue after four years in which there have been two general elections, an EU referendum, and local and European elections. So Labour voters were encouraged, more than any other year, to vote by post. It appeared to work \u2013 turnout among postal voters was 69.4%. 4. Labour concentrated on local issues Voters told Labour it would lose if it fought Peterborough on Brexit, leadership and the economy. So it focused on three issues that have particularly worried local voters: a rising crime rate, the state of local schools, and fly-tipping. This strategy caused some concern, particularly after the EU elections revealed that a single national issue, Brexit, could dominate all others. Before the count on Thursday night, one Labour fixer said: \u201cIf we pull this off, it will show that you can run a local campaign and beat a huge national issue. We have policing, fly-tipping and education; they have Brexit, Brexit and more Brexit.\u201d 5. Momentum mobilised hundreds of activists Despite internal rows over Brexit and tensions between the head of Momentum, Jon Lansman, and Corbyn\u2019s key advisers, the grassroots organisation that swept Corbyn to the top of the party is still a significant force. Momentum claims it mobilised nearly 1,000 activists to knock on doors or make calls in the runup to the byelection. This included activists carpooled to Peterborough from North Wales, London, Winchester, Leeds, Grantham, Leicester, Brighton, Bretton, Northampton and Norwich. Others made thousands of calls using Momentum\u2019s distributed phone bank system to mobilise local party members and persuade swing voters. More than 300 people canvassed on the Saturday before polling day and 500 knocked on doors on polling day. Canvassers successfully squeezed the Lib Dem and Green vote on the doorstep by warning that a misplaced vote could give the Brexit party a foothold. One Guardian reader from the city said he had been visited by Ed Miliband and several activists this week imploring him to vote tactically for Labour \u2013 and he was won over. 6. A snap byelection caught out Nigel Farage\u2019s party One Brexit party insider said: \u201cLabour were sensible in calling a snap byelection while our new party was focusing on the Euros. It was just too big a hill to climb for a fledgling party with no historic data.\u201d 7. The Tory vote held up better than expected The Conservative candidate, Paul Bristow, surprised many by holding on to about 7,000 votes. despite the implosion of the national party over Brexit. Labour owe him a big thank you, one key Brexit party official said. \u201cThe Tories worked very hard, from the moment that Onasanya was found guilty, to keep their vote. Without that work, we would have won.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
