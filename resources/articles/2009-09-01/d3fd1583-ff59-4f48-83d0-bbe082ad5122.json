Welcome, then, to Pat Buchanan, thrice a presidential adviser and an oh so rightwing commentator, who will be a star turn tomorrow in central London at a debate titled \"Churchill was more a liability than an asset to the free world\". Pat supports the motion. There is a hint in his book, Churchill, Hitler and \"The Unnecessary War\": How Britain Lost Its Empire and the West Lost the World. Europe, he says, \"the Mother Continent of Western man, is today ageing and dying, unable to sustain the birth rates needed to keep her alive, or to resist conquest by an immigrant invasion from the third world. What happened to the nations that only a century ago ruled the world?\" But it's worse than that. We are, he has said, part of \"a society suffering from a chronic moral sickness\". Aids is \"nature's awful retribution on homosexuals\". He knows his history. The diesel exhaust fumes the Nazis used in the Treblinka gas chambers \"do not emit enough carbon monoxide to kill anybody\", he declared in 1989. In 1990 he wrote of a better time for his country. \"The 'Negroes' of Washington had their public schools, restaurants, bars, movie houses, playgrounds and churches; and we had ours.\" In that context, London, 2009, might seem a bit scary. He's welcome, all the same. Nothing fazes an old Tory warhorse, and as proof we give you Norman Lamont \u2013 now, Lord Lamont of Lerwick, the former chancellor of the exchequer \u2013 who was holidaying in the Suffolk resort of Aldeburgh when his hotel was evacuated during a fire emergency. With the alarm pulsating and guests assembling outside, Lamont (pictured) remained unflappable. Jackie Silverman, occupying a room on the same corridor, has this report. \"As I emerged to go downstairs, this distinguished-looking silver-haired chap poked his head out from the room next door. He was wearing pale blue pyjamas and his reading glasses were perched on the end of his nose. I said, 'It's a fire alarm,' but he didn't seem in a hurry to evacuate the room. Fifteen minutes later, after a fire engine had arrived and we'd been given the all-clear, I went back to my room and he was in the same position. All he said was, 'Nothing disturbs me from the Financial Times!'\" And yesterday's Financial Times reveals that arson is rising because of the recession, prompting a recollection from another Tory warhorse, the former party chairman Lord (Cecil) Parkinson. As a young accountant he was shown around the now useless factory of a firm which had gone bust. \"What this place could do with is a good fire,\" he mused sadly. \"Fred will do it for \u00a3100,\" his escort said. Sharon Shoesmith, head of children's services in Haringey during the tragedy of Baby P, will argue as part of her claim against dismissal that she was accorded pariah status by the government, on a par with the killers of Jamie Bulger, says the Daily Mail. A headline-catching claim to be sure. Might not cut much ice. But there is always a chance, for we note that her lawyer is Tony Child, who once managed to persuade a tribunal that Ken Livingstone could not be disciplined for misbehaviour because at the time of the offence Ken was wearing a winter coat. With Child on the case, anything can happen. Finally, Richard Desmond will tire of accusations that he is trousering a huge income from the Daily Express while cutting the production staff. We feel sure that Saturday's showbiz headline, asking \"Can Dec anally match Ant?\" has nothing to do with that. It could have happened at any time in the paper's long history. So will Des anally match his predecessors, greats such as Beaverbrook? Well, he is doing very well so far."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
