They write things like this: \"We emerged onto a bare rock in the open sunlight. We stood on a lip of stone beside the course of a waterfall, just under the high fringing lip of the plateau. To the south west, six thousand feet below, the Brazilian jungle stretched away unbroken to the far horizon.\" Unheroic people queue in airports for hours, eating vile food and sharing colds with strangers. But at the end of it, sometimes, you can look down from the ninth floor of a Manhattan hotel and see the New York Public Library. There is more mystery, and more to explore, in a good library than in any wilderness, even though both are necessary for lasting sanity. And the New York Public Library, on Bryant Park, is not merely good. It is great. This is true of the architecture, which is somehow simultaneously massive and uplifting, rather like Durham Cathedral. But while Durham cathedral is built from rather dour sandstone, the Library is all marble, almost white. Since this is New York, there is hardly any location from which you can actually appreciate it. A building so fine should be set on a hill, but it is only four or five stories high. And in Manhattan even the most celebrated skyscrapers are largely invisible from the streets around them, choked out by their competition. Still, there is at least one street from which it can be approached up a line of sententious bronze plaques set into the pavement, and then the whole facade bursts on you at the end of the street. But this is merely the preliminary shock. The awe came when I had mounted the steps between huge marble lions and entered a cavernous marble hall. No merely visual preliminaries could prepare me for the discovery that the whole of this vast chamber, so white and pure looking, actually smells of books: of dust and binding glue, the most evocative smell in the whole world. There are, apparently, 75 miles of bookshelves in that one building, and they quietly exhale enough to perfume a hall eight stories high. Nearly fifteen years of writing about religion have left me quite impervious to moral improvement or spiritual authority. But that room made me understand what a pilgrim believer must have felt, reaching St Peter's, or St Sophia in Constantinople. The combination of beauty and knowledge displayed here entitled its owners to rule the world. It seemed perfectly impossible to resist or even resent a civilisation which could produce the library. I said as much, the next day, to Robert Silvers, the editor of the New York Review of Books, whom I was in New York to profile. He laughed, and replied that he was on the board of the library. The great glory of the institution, he said, was how easy it was for anyone to read there. You could walk off the streets, showing almost any kind of ID, and have any book you asked for delivered from the stacks. The reading room used to be full till eleven o'clock at night with earnest students. What were they reading? Oh, Trotsky, I suppose, he laughed. It is a pity, really, that the people who built that and who believed in that kind of grand democratic philanthropy and respect for learning no longer rule the world. They no longer even rule the USA, which was a cause of his amusement. America now is run by a man who, according to one recent biography, used as a child in Texas to play a popular local game - he and his friends would shove firecrackers up frogs and throw them into the air to watch them explode; now they do that with whole countries. * Andrew Brown, whose column appears on Fridays, is an English author and journalist and the author of The Darwin Wars: The Scientific War for the Soul of Man and In the Beginning Was the Worm: Finding the Secrets of Life in a Tiny Hermaphrodite.
