In a short video posted on social media late on Christmas Eve, the former National party leader is seen feeding cattle and reflecting on climate change, declaring that \u201cnew taxes\u201d are not the way to address it. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to wonder what politicians do on Christmas Eve, well, when it\u2019s drought, feed cattle,\u201d Joyce says. \u201cNow you don\u2019t have to convince me the climate is not changing, it is changing,\u201d he says. \u201cMy problem has always been whether you believe new taxes are going to change it back. \u201cI just don\u2019t want the government any more in my life, I am sick of the government being in my life.\u201d With the camera pointing to the sky, the former deputy prime minister urges Australians to respect God. \u201cThere\u2019s a higher authority that\u2019s beyond our comprehension \u2013 right up there in the sky. And unless we understand that that\u2019s got to be respected, then we\u2019re just fools. We\u2019re going to get nailed.\u201d Social media users commenting on the post were quick to point out that Joyce was a member of the government and that he was free to resign if he wanted it out of his life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
