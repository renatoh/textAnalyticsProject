The London club were 2-0 down after nine minutes to a pair of Gonzalo Higua\u00edn goals \u2013 one of them a penalty \u2013 but they stabilised before taking control. Harry Kane pulled one back on 35 minutes and, although Higua\u00edn missed a second penalty in first-half stoppage time, Pochettino was entitled to say that Tottenham were the dominant force. The outstanding Christian Eriksen scored the equaliser in the 72nd minute and the Juventus manager, Massimiliano Allegri, felt the frustration rise. He poured it out afterwards in an attack on the Italian press, whom he accused of underestimating Tottenham. For Pochettino this was one of the finest results of his career and put his team in charge for the return leg at Wembley on 7 March. \u201cAt 2-0 down my feeling was so bad,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWe started sloppily. But we showed great character and I feel so proud. We are a young team in this competition. To show that kind of performance was fantastic. \u201cThe energy was fantastic and it\u2019s important to say we played with one day less [of rest]. Juventus played last Friday while we had the derby [against Arsenal on Saturday]. One day in this competition is a lot. The derby was emotional, you spend more energy. And at 2-0 you always need more energy. \u201cWe dominated possession and forced them to play deeper and only use the counterattack. We were so focused. Only the opening minutes were difficult to handle. But after that we dominated Juventus and that is a thing to praise. \u201cNot many teams come here and dominate Juventus. We showed we are mature enough to compete in this competition. It is my fourth season at the club and we are always improving in different aspects.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
