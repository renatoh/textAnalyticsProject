Trying to get out of bed, I realised I could barely move. So excruciating was the pain in my back, my only option seemed to be to roll myself \u2013 thunk! \u2013 on to the floor. Lying there on my stomach for a few moments, I took in the view (beneath the bed were old shoes and dust balls the size of planets) and then, screwing up my courage, I crawled on to the landing \u2013 which is where I stayed for the rest of the day, sobbing quietly and wondering how I would get to the loo; when, exactly, the NHS emergency doctor would arrive. In the event, it took two shots of morphine \u2013 one in each arm \u2013 to get me upright again. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d I asked the doctor. He shook his head. \u201cNo idea,\u201d he said. \u201cBut your back is in spasm.\u201d He then disappeared into the night, and I went back to bed thinking that everything would surely be fine in the morning. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t. The next three days were hell. Though I took the naproxen he\u2019d prescribed, it made no difference at all to the pain (it also made me feel sick). I begged my GP for diazepam \u2013 the only thing, according to the back-pain sufferers of Twitter, that would really help \u2013 and was duly given all of seven tablets (so addictive, you see). In order to walk, I had to use my late father\u2019s thumb stick, which made me look, bent over as I was, like an etching of death by D\u00fcrer. My mood grew dark. Sometimes, I would bang this stick against the floor and shout, in a silly voice that I fancied to be Chaucerian: \u201cOh, Earth! Let me in!\u201d On the fourth day, I went to the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in Southwark to see Mark Rylance in Farinelli and the King \u2013 an occasion I\u2019d been looking forward to for weeks and wasn\u2019t going to miss even if I did feel as though I had an arrow in my spine. I survived the theatre\u2019s hard, narrow wooden benches only because I took rather more painkillers and diazepam than is strictly recommended. Afterwards, I walked \u2013 I use the term loosely in this instance \u2013 over the Millennium Bridge, hoping to hail a taxi on the other side of the river. This took 20 minutes, as opposed to the usual three; somewhere in the middle, I stopped and gazed at the dome of St Paul\u2019s and prayed \u2013 yes, prayed (I am not a believer) \u2013 that I would make it across. The driver of the taxi I eventually flagged down didn\u2019t try to hide his shock at how long it took me to get to where he\u2019d pulled in. \u201cYou\u2019re like an old woman!\u201d he said, laughing as if this was a huge joke. \u201cCome on, grandma!\u201d I did not tip him. I booked myself an appointment with a physiotherapist, who rolled me around a bit on his consulting table, and clicked my neck. \u201cIt\u2019s your facet joints, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably ease off soon.\u201d Probably? And what should I do when \u2013 if \u2013 it did? How could I prevent this terrible thing from happening again? \u201cI\u2019m only 45,\u201d I said, weakly. Like the doctor before him, he shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult with backs. No one really knows. Some people find Pilates helps, though.\u201d On the way home (another taxi; back pain was starting to be expensive, as well as everything else), cringing at the approach of every speed bump, I considered this. Pilates? I associated Pilates with women in expensive Lycra who had too much time on their hands: vain women who wanted only to make their stomachs flatter, and the gap between their thighs wider. It wasn\u2019t for me. Then again, I was desperate. I registered with a Pilates website, and a few days later someone called Melanie Christou rang me. She told me that she was a former dancer who\u2019d got into Pilates because of her own back pain. For no other reason than she asked me lots of questions and sounded sensible and warm, I signed up for lessons with her: some one to one, others in a class. Pilates was developed by Joseph Pilates, a German physical trainer, while he was interned by the British during the First World War. Nowadays, it often involves some pretty slick apparatus \u2013 for instance, the strange machine known as a reformer \u2013 but mat classes are equally effective, and vastly cheaper, and these are mostly what I did. Melanie is a brilliant teacher. But still, I remember the embarrassments of my first lesson vividly. Kneeling on all fours with my tail in the air, I felt helpless and vaguely humiliated, as if I was in a short story by Mary Gaitskill about a masochistic secretary (or something). \u201cSee you next week,\u201d I said breezily when I left, lying through my teeth. If I did return, it would only be because I had paid up front for a course. By now, you\u2019ll be thinking this is about to become one of those annoying \u201cPilates-changed-my-life\u201d pieces and, in a way, it is. But the point is that the miracle took a very, very long time to happen; in other words \u2013 and I think this is important \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a miracle at all. I would go to the classes, and I would lie there with my legs up in the air in a double-knee fold, and my arms in the position that is known as \u201crib cage closure\u201d (back over your ears, but not quite touching the floor), and I would think: what on earth is the point of this? Yes, my back pain had gone. But perhaps that would have happened anyway. And the whole business was so irritating: all the talk of \u201ccontrol\u201d and \u201ccentring\u201d; all the micro-adjustments one constantly had to make (Pilates is nothing if not obsessed with precision). So many times I almost gave up. Even now, I\u2019m still not quite sure why I didn\u2019t. Fear, I suppose. What if Pilates had cured me? Doggedly, almost robotically, I kept going. But then, three years in \u2013 three bloody years \u2013 something happened. In fact, lots of things happened, all at once. Suddenly, my body could do things it had never been able to do before \u2013 the plank, press-ups, all sorts \u2013 and it looked different, too: more lean and muscular, my stomach flatter and more defined. My posture was dramatically better \u2013 in a gallery, I could walk around for twice as long before feeling even remotely weary \u2013 and there were other, um, more intimate benefits, which I will not describe here, but which had to do with my pelvic floor. I felt happier, too. As I got better at Pilates, and concentrated on it more fully, the lessons became a breather from everything else: the only time in my week when my brain was not doing somersaults. Its nit-picky precision took me away from my desk and my deadlines. My clothes, I realised, were now too big; when I shopped, I had to buy a size down. I could slip into a pair of corduroys, kept for sentimental reasons, that I\u2019d last worn at university. Above all, I felt 10 times stronger. This was incredibly liberating. On a plane, I was like the Incredible Hulk, lifting my luggage into the locker above my seat with utmost ease. In the garden, I could move terracotta pots around as if they were tiddly-winks. I was slightly amazed. OK, I\u2019d been going to my classes twice a week for three years. But in another way, all this had happened without my making any real effort. Nothing else in my life had changed at all. Another two years on, I\u2019m still doing Pilates, three times a week if I can, and all of the above is still true; though there\u2019s little scientific evidence that Pilates helps with back pain, I\u2019ve also had only one recurrence of it since. But there\u2019s something else, too: a feeling that is hard to articulate, but which has to do with the ways in which physical and emotional strength are surely connected. I turned 50 this year and yet, I feel indomitable, somehow: so full of energy, so avid for life, so keenly interested in everyone and everything. My mood soars. These days, when my Pilates teacher talks of my centre, while I attempt to keep my pelvis utterly still, I feel less scornful. Like the core of the Earth, which cannot be sampled or seen, I can register its power only in the seismic effects it has on other aspects of my life. And they are seismic. It is my secret superpower: my engine and my shield. To pinch from Eudora Welty, all serious daring starts from within. pilates.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
