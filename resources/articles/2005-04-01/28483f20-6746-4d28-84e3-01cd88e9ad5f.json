All purport to believe in making Britain a fairer society. Remember that John Major pledged he would create a classless society by the year 2000, and even Michael Howard wants more people to achieve their full potential. Both Liberal Democrats and Labour have spoken of widening opportunities, with Tony Blair's preface to Labour's manifesto proudly noting that every chapter involves \"breaking down the barriers that stop people fulfiling their talent\". Yet this report not only documents the degree to which the UK has become less socially mobile but (in a rare survey of other states) places Britain along with the US at the bottom of a league table of eight European and North American countries. Norway has the greatest social mobility, followed by Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Germany and Canada. The study looks at what happened to children born in the 1950s with what happened to those born in the 1970s. Considerably more born into the poorest quarter in 1970 were still in the poorest quarter at the age of 30 than those born in the 1950s. The major reason for their lack of income was their lower educational attainment. The researchers then looked at children born in the early 1980s, and although the gap between those staying on at school at 16 narrowed, unequal access to higher education widened. While the proportion of people from the poorest fifth of families obtaining a degree rose from 6% to 9%, the graduation rate for the richest fifth rose from 20% to 47%. Doubling the numbers in higher education in the 1990s ended up helping the better off. With much justification, the Sutton Trust complains that Britain replaced academic selection at 11 with social selection. It points to the proportionately few poor students (just 3% on free school dinners) in the best state schools, compared to the national average of 17%. It recognises that inequality starts long before 11 and urges all parties to commit themselves to a comprehensive strategy for restoring social mobility. This would include much wider provision for early years than Labour plans, free school buses for primary children and more generous educational maintenance grants, both at 16 in school and at university. Free primary-school buses would not just help poor children, whose parents tend not to have cars, to get to better schools, but also reduce school runs and traffic congestion. Not just a policy for social justice - but green too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
