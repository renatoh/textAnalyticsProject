Lamine Diack, the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, said last night that Britain would be left with \"no credibility\" in international sporting circles if the bid from Tottenham Hotspur, which is claimed to offer greater economic certainty, was chosen a week tomorrow. Diack's forceful intervention came as Spurs, who propose to demolish the \u00a3496m stadium and replace it with a purpose-built football ground, and West Ham United, who will partner with Newham council and keep the track, prepared to submit tomorrow their \"best and final\" offers to the Olympic Park Legacy Company. Diack said the London organisers would be guilty of a \"big lie\" in reference to the bid-book promise that the track would be retained and the former culture secretary Tessa Jowell's vow to the IOC that the stadium would be \"a purpose-built home for athletics for years to come\". \"You are dead, you are finished,\" Diack told the BBC. \"There is no way to come back with any proposal as far as my generation is concerned. As far as this, it will be finished. There will be no credibility of a great country like Britain. This country, this city saying they are not able to have a stadium with athletics? They would have made a big lie to us \u2013 my colleague who made the presentation \u2013 a big lie. Is it a betrayal? Yes, absolutely.\" The IAAF president was widely expected to back Paris in the race for the 2012 Games but, persuaded by London's vision for an athletics legacy, the Senegalese switched his vote and convinced others to do so. Since the bid was won the government's legacy promises have made no mention of athletics and the OPLC has insisted on a legacy for the sport but not necessarily in the Park. Tottenham propose to redevelop Crystal Palace as a 25,000-seat athletics stadium and establish a legacy fund. West Ham hit back today for the first time at Spurs' claims that fans would be unable to see the ball and would struggle to fill the stadium under their plans to retain the track. The east London club said their pricing strategy would \"encourage a full stadium\" and claimed their \"state-of-the-art roof design\" would create \"an intimate environment\". West Ham will offer family tickets for the same price as a single Upton Park ticket, give away tickets to local schools and the community and still promise a healthy return to the OPLC. Both clubs have been asked for different business cases based on Premier League and Championship figures. Outlining their bid in detail for the first time, West Ham said they would host 20 days of top-class athletics, live concerts that could attract 107,000 fans at a time, Twenty20 cricket and world championship boxing. Tonight Newham council voted unanimously to provide the loan that will underwrite West Ham's plans for the stadium. The chief executive, Kim Bromley-Derry, said: \"It's a loan through a special purpose vehicle [SPV], not to the club. The club will be the anchor tenant and the club will be paying a rent for their tenancy.\" Bromley-Derry said the business case was not based on West Ham being a Premier League club and that the council had no concerns about either the club's owners or future over the term of the lease, believed to be for more than 200 years. \"We don't envisage there will be any further drain on the public purse for the lifespan of the stadium,\" Bromley-Derry said. \"We're very confident in our business case.\" He would not comment on the size of the loan but it is believed the SPV will ultimately borrow at least \u00a340m through the council. Diack's comments appear to kill any chance of Britain hosting the 2017 World Athletics Championships if Spurs win the increasingly acrimonious battle. A proposed bid for the 2015 championships has been abandoned. \"To now demolish the Olympic Stadium, throwing away the original \u00a3500m investment of public money seems to me an outrageous proposition, especially in the present world economic climate,\" Diack added in a statement. Supporters of the Spurs option point out that UK Athletics, its commercial backers and the IAAF were unable between them to find the \u00a35m a year that would have made a dedicated 25,000-seat stadium on the Park a viable option. That remains a fallback plan if the OPLC decides against both bids but would require it to begin the search for a tenant all over again. Spurs' plans were also criticised by the Crystal Palace co-owner Steve Parish as he unveiled his club's rival \u00a350m plans to redevelop the National Sports Centre site, funded by a combination of the sale of Selhurst Park, new-stadium naming rights and pre-sales of corporate and debenture seats. \"It would be like Charlton Athletic moving to Croydon,\" said Parish said of the prospect of Spurs moving to West Ham's home borough. \"If you said that was happening I would think you were criminally insane. As a football fan I think it's a nonsense, but that doesn't mean it isn't going to happen.\" He will argue that if West Ham win the right to move into the Olympic Park it would create a sustainable future for three new stadiums in London \u2013 at White Hart Lane, Stratford and Crystal Palace. Parish said that if the Spurs bid won, however, he would still be prepared to have a conversation about \"building a stadium that is dual use for athletics and football from the ground up\". Spurs and their partner AEG, the O2 operator and a major sports and entertainment player in the US, are insistent that the only viable commercial option is to rebuild the Olympic Stadium and provide an athletics legacy elsewhere."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
