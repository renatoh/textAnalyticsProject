The Israeli's decision to omit Joe Cole and Michael Ballack for the showpiece while asking Nicolas Anelka to play wide on the left of a front three and alongside Didier Drogba for the first time, appeared to contribute to a disjointed performance at Wembley. Spurs prevailed in extra-time, with the Chelsea hierarchy dissatisfied in defeat, though Grant has no regrets. \"It was just one bad day in the life of a team,\" said Grant. \"I don't think I made mistakes in my selection. We came with a very, very strong team. We played with John Obi Mikel, [Michael] Essien and [Frank] Lampard. That same midfield has won many games. Shaun [Wright-Phillips] had been our best player in the semi-final. Didier and Nicolas are great strikers. We had a great defence. It was a good selection. But sometimes the selection is good and the performance is not so good. But I don't live in the past. We were in the title race all the time, but now it's more clear. We've got this game in hand so we can close the gap.\" A win tonight would hoist Chelsea to 67 points, level with Arsenal. Indeed, the team's league record under Grant is remarkable: they are unbeaten in 12 matches stretching back to the defeat at Arsenal in mid-December, one of only two losses he has suffered in his 23 Premiership games in charge. The concern is that the other was to Manchester United which, combined with the Carling Cup final defeat and FA Cup elimination at Barnsley, has fuelled suspicions that his team are vulnerable in key contests. Grant, who will assess Petr Cech's recovery from an ankle injury, dismissed such criticism. \"Any game Chelsea lose is a big match,\" he added. \"If we'd won at Barnsley or in the Carling Cup, people wouldn't have said they were big matches. Barnsley, on paper, wasn't a big match. It was, though, after we lost. When you win against Tottenham in the league [Spurs were beaten 2-0 in January], it's 'reasonable'. When we lose against them in the Carling Cup, it's a big match. I'm sure that if we win this game it'll be 'reasonable'.\" Chelsea's game of catch-up means any slip-up would seriously damage their challenge, and Grant concedes that his friendship with the club's owner, Roman Abramovich, would count for little should he fail to claim a trophy this season. \"When we speak about the team, friendship does not come into it. It's totally separate but, if he ever sacks me, he'll still be my friend.\" Blue period 2006-07 Premier Lge App 32 (4 as sub) Goals 20 (0.56/game) FA Cup App 6 (0 as sub) Goals 3 (0.5/game) Carling Cup App 3 (2 as sub) Goals 4 (0.8/game) Champ Lge App 12 (0 as sub) Goals 6 (0.5/game) Total App 53 (6 as sub) 2007/2008 Before African Cup of Nations Premier Lge App 10 (1 as sub) Goals 5 (0.45/game) FA Cup App 0 (1) Carling Cup App 0 (0) Champ Lge App 4 (0) Goals 4 (1/game) Total App 14 (2) Since African Cup of Nations Premier Lge App 1 (1) FA Cup App 0 (0) Carling Cup App 1 (0) Goals 1 (1/game) Champ Lge App 2 (0) Total App 4 (1)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
