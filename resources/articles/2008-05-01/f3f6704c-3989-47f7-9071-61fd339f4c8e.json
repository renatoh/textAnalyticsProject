A piercing depiction of a swathe of Italian society in the choking grip of the Napoli Mafia, the Camorra, it is the only chef d'oeuvre on show. Director Matteo Garrone, working from the bestseller by Roberto Saviano, has created a modern classic that blends documentary inquiry with a thrilling crisscross of stories and characters all caught in the web of slavery and poverty spun by the Mafia. This isn't a film about mythology and glamour in the way that American movies have festishised the mob, but a brutal confrontation between the thuggish morality and the Camorra's skewed economic logic. In a simple pitch, it's City of God meets The Godfather. There are plenty of nods to neo-realism, too - to Federico Fellini and Vittorio De Sica in particular - yet what makes it special is the director's ability to balance his protagonists and storylines while drawing pity, shock and humour from the situation. The housing estate where the film is set resembles a crumbling, decommissioned cruise liner; Garrone's characters swarm about this hive of corruption, along its corridors, on its towers, at its gates. There's the dapper retainer Don Ciro in his cream bomber jacket; the 10-year-old kid serving an apprenticeship as a decoy for assassinations; the Scarface-obsessed teenagers who find guns and think they can make it to the top alone; fat bosses and their ratty cohorts; the gifted tailor forced into a sweatshop life; the dying Don whose death-bed curse is aimed at 'the euro, the euro'; the linen-clad fixer (Toni Servillo) organising disposal of toxic waste in a huge quarry, a metaphor for the poisons seeping deep into the earth, the culture. Already a hit in Italy where it opened last weekend, Gomorra should win the Palme d'Or tonight. I can see jury president Sean Penn - who early on stated that the winner under his watch will have 'something to say about the times' - sizing up a part in the remake. At its heart, however, Gomorra is about poverty, politics and leadership, the recurring themes of this thoughtful if unspectacular Cannes. Linha de Passe, Walter Salles's film co-directed with Daniela Thomas, followed four brothers in the faceless mass of S\u00e3o Paulo, beautifully tracking their stories amid the chaos of humanity. One is looking to religion, one to crime, another to football and the youngest to a photograph of his absent, black father. This was a lovely work, one that cared deeply for its characters, their mother and the future. Steven Soderbergh gave us two Spanish-language films about Che Guevara, whose early life Salles chronicled so richly in The Motorcycle Diaries at Cannes four years ago. Played by Mexico's Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal then, he's now embodied, with full complement of whiskers, by the superb Puerto Rican actor Benicio del Toro in Che. Soderbergh's films, which played back-to-back in a marathon four-and-a-half-hour session, dealt first with the 1957 revolution set against flash-forwards of his visit to the UN in New York in 1964 and then with his efforts to bring revolution to Bolivia. Che's commitment to his people and his cause makes for stirring stuff and fine guerrilla battles. Certainly one of the best in competition, it's a moody, macho film although a touch on the dour side considering Soderbergh's usual slickness. China's Jia Zhangke also looked at the plight of the disenfranchised in 24 City, a haunting, sad film about a factory in Chengdu, a city near the epicentre of the recent earthquake. Examining the life of an old, giant factory through testimonies of its ex-workers, the film catches China on the cusp of change as the plant is being turned into luxury apartment blocks. It has much in common, remarkably, with Terence Davies's gorgeous Mersey memoir, Of Time and the City, whose rapturous reception here heralded the director's return to a global stage. It's a collage of memories, music and musings over superb archival shots of old Liverpool through the seasons, with Davies's fruity, basso delivery praising the old working classes at work and play, citing Engels ('removed from the sight of the happier classes, poverty may struggle along as it can'), TS Eliot and Willem de Kooning: 'The trouble with being poor is that it takes up all of your time.' The trouble with being rich, adds Davies's voice summing up the Cannes mood, is that it takes up everyone else's. Two icons rolled into town. Mike Tyson, huge and square, as if he'd swallowed a boxing ring, was the subject of a measured documentary by James Toback, who got the former champ and former ghetto hoodlum to reveal unsavoury things about his will to dominate powerful women. But the film Tyson also showed a man coming to terms with his faded brilliance, wealth and power, reminders of his awesome, thunder-and-lightning punches conveyed in thrilling montages. Maradona by Kusturica was so un-detached it's the most uproarious and rambunctious documentary ever made. Emir Kusturica, the holder of two Palmes d'Or, is the film as much as his subject and, positioning Maradona as a revolutionary leader of the poor, delivers a series of grandiloquent voice-overs. He sees the spirit of Diego in his own films and shows us clips of his work alongside lots of wonderful Maradona goals. Kusturica bests Toback in actually going toe to toe with his icon, playing impressive headers and volleys with him and even curling a 25-yarder into the top corner during a session on the Red Star Belgrade pitch. Toback would have been foolish to spar with Iron Mike, I guess, but you've got to respect Emir for such skills. Maradona, so at one with the ball in his playing days, now resembles a giant one himself but he and Tyson now share two things; other than flawed heroism and being miles ahead of their peers they both have tattoos of Che Guevara and Fidel Castro. It has to be said that in comparison, American films in competition came across as inward-looking and indulgent. Clint Eastwood's Changeling was a ponderous, pompous, story set in 1920s LA, featuring a decent performance from Angelina Jolie waiting for her lost son to come back. James Gray's muted, portentous New York-set romance, Two Lovers, featured a revealing flash from Gwyneth Paltrow - she's positioning herself as quite the sex siren these days - and Joaquin Phoenix in a ridiculous anorak. Taking the interior aspect to dizzying absurdity was Charlie Kaufman's directing debut, Synecdoche, New York, which takes place in the fevered mind of its playwright protagonist Philip Seymour Hoffman as he tries to create and direct a masterwork that reflects adequately the pains, aches and lonelinesses of real life. It's one of the oddest major feature films I've ever seen, terribly haunted and sad, trembling on the knife-edge between bonkers and brilliant. Making a last-minute bid for the main prize came a stupendously good film from France's Laurent Cantet. Entre les murs (The Class) centres on the way a young teacher (Fran\u00e7ois B\u00e9gaudeau) deals with his 14-year-old pupils. Cantet's mix of docu-realism, improvisation and scripted dialogue creates the most extraordinary atmosphere, one that pulses with humour, love and tension and demands questions - political and philosophical - of any education system. It brought a Cannes all about inspirational leaders and society's dreams to a rousing close and should be near the top of the class at tonight's prize-giving."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
