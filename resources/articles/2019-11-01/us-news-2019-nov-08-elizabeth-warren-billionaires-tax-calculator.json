On Thursday, the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg opened the door to a possible 2020 run \u2013 which would make him the second billionaire, alongside Tom Steyer, to finance a run for the White House. A day earlier, Bill Gates expressed disdain for Warren\u2019s proposed wealth tax. \u201cI\u2019ve paid over $10bn in taxes,\u201d Gates said at the New York Times\u2019s Dealbook conference on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve paid more than anyone in taxes. If I had to pay $20bn, it\u2019s fine. But when you say I should pay $100bn, OK, then I\u2019m starting to do a little math about what I have left over.\u201d Gates, whose net worth is an estimated $107bn, would have a mere $7bn to survive on under that scenario. But as the Warren campaign was quick to point out, he wouldn\u2019t be forced to pay anywhere near that much. To illustrate the point, Warren shared a tool on her site called A Calculator for Billionaires to help Gates, Bloomberg and other wealth hoarders work out how much they would pay. \u201cSome billionaires seem confused about how much they would pay under Elizabeth\u2019s Ultra-Millionaire Tax,\u201d the site explains. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, now we have a calculator for that too.\u201d The page first asks visitors if they are a billionaire or not. A yes answer offers a prompt to enter your net worth, with quick links available for Bloomberg, Gates or Leon Cooperman, the hedge-fund billionaire who recently criticized Warren\u2019s tax proposals as \u201cidiocy\u201d and \u201cbull\u201d. Clicking through as Gates brings an exciting result. \u201cWow! You\u2019ve got a lot of money,\u201d it reads. \u201cYour wealth puts you in the top 0.0002% of Americans. Now you have the opportunity to invest some of it back into our society so everyone has a chance to succeed.\u201d Gates would pay $6.379bn in tax next year, according to the calculator. Bloomberg would pay $3.079bn. Overall, Warren\u2019s tax would install a 2% rate on a net worth of $50m to $1bn, and 6% for those who earn more than $1bn. \u201cGood news \u2013 you\u2019ll still be extraordinarily rich!\u201d the calculator says. \u201cAnd if history is any guide, if you do nothing other than invest your wealth in the stock market, it\u2019s likely that your wealth will continue to grow.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
