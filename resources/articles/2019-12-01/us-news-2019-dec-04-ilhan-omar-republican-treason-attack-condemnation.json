A fundraising letter sent by George Buck, a Republican running for Congress, suggests that Omar, a Democrat, be executed for treason. \u201cWe should hang these traitors where they stand,\u201d the email reads. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Buck initially blamed the email on an errant staff member before seemingly backtracking and sending the newspaper a statement that referenced the death penalty for treason. \u201cAnyone who commits treason against the United States should be tried to the full extent of the law,\u201d said Buck, who is a member of the Young Guns program run by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC). On Wednesday the NRCC and Kevin McCarthy, Republican House minority leader, removed Buck from the program in the wake of his comments. Buck is the second Republican to reference the hanging of Omar, a Somali-born Muslim, in the past week. A campaign account for Danielle Stella, a pro-Trump Republican candidate for Congress, was banned from Twitter after suggesting Omar be hanged, along with a depiction of a stick figure hanging from the gallows. Both Buck and Stella have based their accusations of treason on an unverified report that Omar is an asset of Qatar who has passed sensitive information on to Iran. There has been no evidence put forward to support this theory and has not been backed by any US government assessment. Omar is a frequent critic of Donald Trump, as well as the human rights records of both Israel and Saudi Arabia. Trump has repeatedly accused his critics of being guilty of treason and said Omar and other political opponents in Congress who are women of colour should be \u201csent back\u201d to the \u201ccrime infested places from which they came\u201d despite their either being born in the US or gaining citizenship and now holding national office. \u201cThe fact that those who make these violent threats very publicly without hesitation reaffirms how much white supremacy has spread within the @NRCC,\u201d tweeted Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat and Omar ally who has also been targeted by Trump. \u201cThey are raising money on a call to hang a Black Muslim member of Congress and too many are silent.\u201d Steve Scalise, the House Republican whip, also criticised Buck. \u201cThere\u2019s no place for inciting violence in politics,\u201d Scalise said in a statement. \u201cInstead of doubling down on these disgraceful comments, the candidate ought to apologize unequivocally and denounce these unacceptable statements.\u201d Buck is one of several Republicans vying to take Florida\u2019s 13th congressional district, which is centered on the city of St Petersburg.
