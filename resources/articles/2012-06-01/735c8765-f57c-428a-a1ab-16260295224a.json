The noun is a place, a city of fragile beauty perched on a cold northern latitude; the adjective is a set of attitudes, a world view. If something is described as very Edinburgh, most people in Scotland know exactly what is meant. Which is? Well, think Jean Brodie, think David Hume, think \u2026 Eric Liddell. Eric Liddell? Chariots of Fire \u2026 of course \u2013 the 1981 Hugh Hudson film. Liddell was the remarkable Scot who won the 400m in the 1924 Olympics in Paris and who \u2013 footballers aside \u2013 could lay claim to being Scotland's most famous sportsman. Although Liddell was born in China, to missionary parents, Edinburgh was the family home in which he spent part of his childhood and to which he returned for his university years. Today he is honoured there in the Eric Liddell Centre, a remarkable place that expresses Scottish communitarian instincts through its support for local volunteer organisations. Liddell's Edinburgh was in important respects a very different place from Edinburgh today, even if there are features that have survived and that still give this city its special character. In the 1920s, Edinburgh was definitely a provincial city, a description that if used today can be calculated to raise the hackles. I can hear them. Provincial? We are certainly NOT provincial: we are a capital city. Yes, yes, but the fact of the matter was that Edinburgh, and the rest of Scotland, had been an enthusiastic participant in the project of the British empire and had been gutted by the union of any significant political influence. The decisions that really counted were made in London, even if vestiges of statehood \u2013 legal and educational systems and a national church \u2013 had been left in place. Edinburgh, at the time of the 1924 Olympic Games, was smug and compliant. Here and there were traces of political and intellectual radicalism but, for the most part, the city was a pretty, rather quiet place, an ideal base for an unassuming, modest man such as Liddell, who understood his role in life in evangelical terms. How different it is today. There is a parliament, there is the world's greatest arts festival, there are ambitious banks (one of them perhaps, in the past, rather too ambitious), there is internationally distinguished scientific and cultural activity. If Edinburgh used to look inward and congratulate itself on the achievements of the Scottish enlightenment, today it looks outward and asks itself what its proper place is. The answers proposed range from Tam Dalyell's iconoclastic suggestion that the Scottish parliament be abolished, to the vision of the current Scottish government that Edinburgh should once again be the capital of an independent Scotland. Most of the city's citizens fall somewhere in the doubting middle of that spectrum. Most of them, according to opinion polls, would like Edinburgh to continue to be what it is today: the capital of a country within the United Kingdom. Mr Salmond does not want that. He wants a new team to be in the 2016 Olympics. Edinburgh watches it all with interest \u2013 a slightly superior smile on its face. After all, it is that sort of place.
