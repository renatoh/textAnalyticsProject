Talks will continue tomorrow, according to both President Trump and Mexico\u2019s foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard. Greg Gianforte, the Montana congressman who pleaded guilty to body-slamming former Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs the day before the state special election, might be running for governor of Montana in 2020. President Trump discussed the Vietnam War and military service with Piers Morgan, and Senator Tammy Duckworth, who lost both her legs while serving in Iraq, was none too pleased with \u201cCadet Bone Spurs\u201d. Here\u2019s a dispatch from David Agren, our correspondent in Mexico: Mexico\u2019s foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard said talks will continue tomorrow, but that US officials focused more on migration matters than tariffs today. That\u2019s a departure from past years, when US and Mexican officials tried to keep matters like trade, security and migration separate. \u201cWhat the US government is looking for are measures in the short-term and medium-term\u201d on migration, Ebrard said. Mexico is promoting a multi-billion dollar development deal for Central America, which president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador insists will slow migration, but observers say won\u2019t show results for decades. Mexico acknowledged the flows of migrants \u201care growing too much\u201d and can\u2019t continue. Mexico is desperate to do a deal. The economy has been sluggish and with tariffs, it\u2019s expected to worsen. Two rating agencies worsened their outlook for Mexico today. Another caravan also entered the country and soldiers just stopped it. President Trump issued a statement via tweet on the US-Mexico talks around tariffs and immigration: Senator Tammy Duckworth, who lost both her legs serving her Iraq, took umbrage with the comments that President Trump made regarding the Vietnam War and military service. She responded to his remarks today: Greg Gianforte, the Montana congressman who pleaded guilty to body-slamming former Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs the day before the state special election, has reportedly told some of his Republican colleagues that he will be running for governor of Montana in 2020, the Hill is reporting. President Trump spoke to Piers Morgan this morning at length about climate change and Meghan Markle - but the discussion also had some interesting tidbits about the Vietnam War, a war in which Trump famously got out of serving because he had a physician\u2019s letter stating he suffered from bone spurs in his feet. Morgan asked if he wished he had served in Vietnam. \u201cWell, I was never a fan of that war, I\u2019ll be honest with you,\u201d Trump answered. \u201cI thought it was a terrible war. I thought it was very far away. At that time, nobody had ever heard of the country.\u201d When asked whether serving in the military was something he would have liked to have done, Trump said, \u201cI would have been honored, but I think I make up for it right now. \u201cI think I\u2019m making up for it rapidly because we\u2019re rebuilding our military at a level it\u2019s never seen before,\u201d he said. Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over for Erin Durkin. Please make sure to take a moment and read the only politics story you need today: a fearless profile by Matthew Cantor of the dog mayor of a Californian town. Donald Trump wrapped up a state visit to the UK, where he dismissed the climate crisis as just a change in the weather, and headed for Ireland, where said Brexit will work out very well for the country. New figures showed a growing surge in migrants crossing the US border, and US and Mexican officials sat down for talks over Trump\u2019s threat to put tariffs on the country\u2019s goods if they don\u2019t stem migration. The Trump administration said it is ending recreation, education, and legal aid services at shelters for immigrant youth. Joe Biden reaffirmed his support for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funds from being used for abortion, drawing criticism from rival presidential candidates and pro-choice groups. Meanwhile, Democratic contenders issued a host of new policy plans: Kirsten Gillibrand on legalizing marijuana, Cory Booker on housing, Beto O\u2019Rourke on voting rights, and Jay Inslee on international climate leadership. Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski attended the annual fundraising gala for the conservative anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List, HuffPost reports. The news comes as the Illinois congressman is taking heat from progressives over his status as one of the few Democrats in Congress who oppose abortion rights. North Carolina\u2019s legislature failed to override a veto by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper of a bill that would have made it a crime if doctors and nurses failed to care for an infant delivered during an unsuccessful abortion, per AP. House homeland security committee chairman Bennie Thompson introduced legislation Wednesday to require the federal government to produce an annual public report on incidents of domestic terrorism. \u201cDomestic terrorism, fueled largely by a surge in white supremacist extremism, presents a growing threat to the security of our homeland,\u201d Thompson said, according to the Hill. CNN is suing the FBI to make public documents from Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. The network says it sued for access to memos outlining what more than 500 witnesses told Mueller\u2019s investigators about Russian election interference, the role of the Trump campaign, and potential obstruction of justice. The FBI had refused to release them pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s other new job is as a contributing editor at the Atlantic. As a Vice editor points out, he wrote an op-ed there headlined \u201cIt\u2019s Time to Hold American Elites Accountable for Their Abuses,\u201d two weeks before announcing he was going to work for a Wall Street bank. Mexico will make its own demands in talks with the US to stave off tariffs, Reuters reports. The Mexican delegation plans to demand redirecting US security funds to Mexico\u2019s southern border, Mexican sources tell Reuters. They\u2019ll also call for a \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d for Central American countries, to boost development there and discourage migrants from making the trek to Mexico and on to the US. Mexico will also demand that the US top the flow of weapons and ammunition to criminal cartels. And they are refusing to accept a proposed designation as a \u201csafe third country,\u201d which would require migrants who arrive first in Mexico to apply for asylum there instead of applying in the US. Trump has threatened 5% tariffs on goods imported by Mexico if the country does not stop immigrants from crossing into the US. New York Mayor and presidential hopeful Bill de Blasio acknowledges needing to brush up on 19th century literature after an inapt comparison of Joe Biden to Dr. Jekyll (who was the good guy). Republican Senator Chuck Grassley predicted that tariffs on Mexican goods will never go into effect. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any tariffs,\u201d Grassley said, the Associated Press reported. \u201cThey got a long list of things they\u2019re going to offer to us, and it will preclude tariffs going into effect.\u201d Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is joining the investment bank Centerview Partners LLC, the Wall Street Journal reports. He will open a Chicago office for the Wall Street firm and advise clients on merger deals and other matters. Perhaps surprisingly, several environmental groups have endorsed \u2014 or at least aren\u2019t actively opposing \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s latest appointee to the Department of Interior: Robert Wallace as Assistant Secretary of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. The Hill reports that Wallace, a Wyoming native and longtime lobbyist for General Electric, has garnered the support of the The National Park Conservation Association (NPCA), Ducks Unlimited and the National Wildlife Refuge Association, citing their background working with him. Wallace has spoken before two Senate committees this week on his willingness to ease tensions between the federal government and more local partners. \u201cPartner is an easy word to say, but a hard word to implement,\u201d he told senators Wednesday. \u201cThe federal government always shows up as the alpha, and that\u2019s a model I will work to better equalize.\u201d As the Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel points out, today\u2019s endorsement of Bill de Blasio by the Hotel Trades Council is only the second union endorsement in the Democratic primary. The firefighters\u2019 union has endorsed Joe Biden. Some reporting from the endorsement event, which comes after de Blasio\u2019s administration pursued a series of policies helpful to the union: Joe Biden is leading Donald Trump in a hypothetical matchup in Texas, according to a new Quinnipiac poll. Biden leads Trump 48% to 44% among voters in the state, which has traditionally voted Republican. Against other top Democrats, Trump comes out a few points on top. The poll also found that registered Democrats and Democratic leaning voters say by a 60% to 27% margin that former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke should challenge Republican incumbent Sen. John Cornyn in 2020 rather than continue his campaign for president. The Trump administration is allowing a major expansion of hunting and fishing in the nation\u2019s wildlife refuges. The Associated Press reports: The plan affects 1.4 million acres (5,666 square kilometers) on federal public lands, including 74 national wildlife refuges, U.S. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said at the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge along Lake Erie in northern Ohio. The proposal would also allow hunting and fishing for the first time at 15 national fish hatcheries. \u201cIt\u2019s a dramatic statement about our commitment to access,\u201d Bernhardt said, adding: \u201cThe goal is to get more people out.\u201d... Among refuges where the expansion is proposed are Green Bay National Wildlife Refuge in Wisconsin and Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge in Wyoming, where deer and elk hunting would be allowed for the first time. Bernhardt said the expansion is the largest proposed by the administration to date. The plan is to finalize the proposal by September after public comment. US authorities took more than 144,000 migrants into custody in May, the highest monthly total in 13 years and a jump of a third from the previous month, the Washington Post reports. \u201cWe are in a full-blown emergency, and I cannot say this stronger: the system is broken,\u201d said acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders. The figures include 132,887 people apprehended by the Border Patrol after crossing the border illegally and 11,391 who arrived at legal ports of entry and were deemed \u201cinadmissible.\u201d Donald Trump will speak at the Lincoln Memorial during a July 4 celebration, the Washington Post reports. He\u2019ll be the first president in recent history to participate in the public celebrations on the National Mall. Trump wants to refashion the event as \u201cA Salute to America,\u201d according to the Post. Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said he\u2019s welcome to speak but should refrain from divisive rhetoric. \u201cThe president can speak at any event that he wants to speak at,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd my great hope would be that he recognizes that the event is a unifying event that celebrates the birthday of our nation.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Donald Trump is treating Mexico \u201clike an enemy\u201d with his tariff threats. She accused him of using the plan to distract attention from the controversy over the Mueller investigation, the Hill reported. She called it \u201cbad policy\u201d and then said that was too kind. \u201cI don\u2019t even think it rises to the level of policy. I think it\u2019s notion-mongering \u2014 again,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really, well, let\u2019s face what it is: It\u2019s a distraction from the Mueller report. And it served its purpose, right? Here we are, here we are.\u201d New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is jumping in on the criticism of Joe Biden\u2019s support for the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal money from being used to pay for abortions. House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler said he\u2019s \u201cconfident\u201d special counsel Robert Mueller will testify before Congress. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that I\u2019m confident he\u2019ll come in soon,\u201d Nadler told reporters Wednesday, the Hill reported. He said the committee will subpoena Mueller \u201cif we have to.\u201d House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said fellow Republicans should support Donald Trump\u2019s plan for tariffs on Mexican goods. \u201cEnd of the day we should support the president so we can get an agreement so we don\u2019t have tariffs. Them talking about not supporting him undercuts his ability to do that,\u201d McCarthy said Wednesday, the Hill reported. Many Republicans have opposed the tariffs and threatened legislation to block them. A majority of Americans say they think Donald Trump will win a second term, a new poll found. In the CNN poll, 54% say their best guess is that Trump will win the 2020 election, while 41% predict he will lose. The prediction comes despite the fact that on every issue polled other than the economy, more Americans disapprove than approve of Trump\u2019s performance. Donald Trump said Brexit will \u201cwork out very well\u201d for Ireland. \u201cI think it will all work out very well, and also for you with your wall, your border. I mean, we have a border situation in the United States, and you have one over here. But I hear it\u2019s going to work out very well here,\u201d he said before a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. The Irish leader made clear he has no interest in a wall like the one Trump wants on the US-Mexico border. \u201cI think one thing we want to avoid, of course, is a wall or border between us,\u201d Varadkar said. \u201cThe way it works now is good,\u201d Trump said of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, a contentious issue in Brexit talks. \u201cI think it should be good. The big thing is going to be your border, and hopefully that\u2019s going to work out, and I think it will work out.\u201d Donald Trump said he believes Mexico is prepared to make a deal to avert tariffs. \u201cMexico, you know, wants to make a deal,\u201d he told reporters on a trip to Ireland, according to a pool report. \u201cThey have their entire delegation right now going over to probably the White House location to negotiate with our people.\u201d \u201cI think they want to do something. They\u2019re sending their top people,\u201d Trump said. The Guardian\u2019s environment correspondent points out some of holes in Donald Trump\u2019s claims today about climate change. Trump dismissed the crisis as a \u201cchange in weather\u201d that \u201cchanges both ways\u201d and said the US has \u201camong the cleanest climates there are.\u201d The US is the world\u2019s second biggest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions, and the highest on a per capita basis. (China is #1 overall). Democratic candidates are pushing for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, after former Vice President Joe Biden said he still supports the rule. The amendment bars federal funding from being used for abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or a threat to the woman\u2019s life. \u201cRepealing the Hyde Amendment is critical so that low-income women in particular can have access to the reproductive care they need and deserve,\u201d tweeted New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. \u201cReproductive rights are human rights, period. They should be nonnegotiable for all Democrats.\u201d Former Texas Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke tweeted simply: \u201cRepeal the Hyde Amendment,\u201d along with a video of him advocating for reproductive choice in a town hall. A Texas teacher has been fired after sending tweets to Donald Trump saying her school district \u201cis loaded with illegal students from Mexico\u201d and pushing for \u201cremoving illegals that are in the public school system,\u201d CBS DFW reported. High school English teacher Georgia Clark told school officials she didn\u2019t understand that her tweets to the president were public, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. The payday lending industry spent $1 million at two annual conferences held at the Trump National Doral hotel outside Miami, ProPublica reports. The Trump administration, meanwhile, is moving to roll back Obama-era regulations on the industry, which would have required lenders to verify that borrowers could afford to pay back their loans while also covering basic living expenses before making a loan. The Trump administration said Wednesday it is ending medical research by government scientists using human fetal tissue, a victory for abortion foes that comes despite impassioned pleas from scientists that some health problems can\u2019t be studied any other way. The Associated Press reports: Research using fetal tissue that otherwise would be discarded has been funded by the government, under leadership of both political parties, for decades \u2014 and has led to life-saving advances including development of vaccines for rubella and rabies, and drugs for the HIV virus. Officials said government-sponsored research by universities will be allowed to continue, subject to additional scrutiny. But ongoing research at the National Institutes of Health involving fetal tissue from elective abortion would not be allowed to proceed. The policy change won\u2019t affect privately funded research that uses human fetal tissue. \u201cPromoting the dignity of human life from conception to natural death is one of the very top priorities of President Trump\u2019s administration,\u201d the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. But ending its use is a priority for anti-abortion activists, a core element of President Donald Trump\u2019s political base. Trump casts himself as \u201cstrongly pro-life,\u201d and his administration has taken many steps to restrict access to abortion, which remains a legal medical procedure. Trump has nominated federal judges who oppose abortion, attempted to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, and expanded legal protection for medical providers who object to abortion. Defending her reluctance to initiate impeachment proceedings, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stressed that impeachment would not actually mean Donald Trump would be removed from office. \u201cDo you know that most people think impeachment means you\u2019re out of office?\u201d she said Wednesday, the Washington Post reported. \u201cThey think, if you get impeached, you\u2019re gone. And that is completely not true. And I may have thought that myself 50 years ago.\u201d Under constitutional procedures, the House of Representatives may impeach a president by majority vote. But impeachment is the equivalent of an indictment, not a conviction. The Senate must then hold a trial, and only if the president is convicted by a two-thirds vote will he be removed from office. In recent history, President Bill Clinton was impeached by the House but not convicted by the Senate, and he completed his term. Pelosi has faced growing pressure from members of the Democratic caucus to move on impeachment, but has maintained the divisive proceedings are not worth it. \u201cMake no mistake, we know exactly what path we\u2019re on,\u201d she said Wednesday, according to the Post. \u201cWe know exactly what actions we need to take.\u201d The Washington Post fact checks Donald Trump\u2019s comments this morning justifying his ban on transgender military service members. In an interview with Piers Morgan on \u201cGood Morning Britain,\u201d Trump said the prohibition is due to prescription drugs used by transgender people during their transition. \u201cYou\u2019re in the military, you\u2019re not allowed to take any drugs,\u201d he said. As the Post notes, this is untrue. Military service members are allowed to take prescription medication. Nor is there any specific prohibition on the hormones commonly used in gender reassignment. \u201cThis statement is incorrect,\u201d said Jane Schacter, an expert on gender and sexuality law at Stanford University. \u201cMany members of the military use prescription medication, and it is made available to them worldwide. Hormone therapy, in particular, is prescribed, including to manage the gynecological needs of non-transgender service members.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s top trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNN Wednesday that tariffs against Mexico \u201cmay not have to go into effect\u201d if the country gets more aggressive in blocking immigration. \u201cRight now, the Mexican government makes money off illegal immigration. After the tariffs are put in place, the Mexican government will bear a cost of that. We believe that these tariffs may not have to go into effect precisely because we have the Mexicans\u2019 attention,\u201d he said. \u201cVice President Pence will be meeting with them today, Secretary of State Pompeo and (US Trade Representative) Robert Lighthizer. I think let\u2019s stay calm and look at the chess board here.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence will meet Wednesday with top Mexican officials who are seeking to head off the administration\u2019s threatened tariffs, the Hill reports. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard is representing his country at the talks and expected to argue Mexico is already taking steps to prevent migrants from crossing the US-Mexico border. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says Paul Manafort should not be held in solitary confinement, and nor should anyone else. Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chair, is reportedly heading for Rikers Island where he\u2019s likely to be held in solitary while awaiting trial on New York state charges. Former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee has moved to Wyoming and changed his political affiliation for the fourth time. The Boston Globe reports that Chafee has registered as a Libertarian. He was once a Republican, and later became an independent and then a Democrat. Chafee says his views haven\u2019t changed much, but he\u2019s struggled to find a party that fits them. \u201cI bought property in Wyoming and registered to vote out there in my fourth party \u2014 I\u2019m a Libertarian,\u201d he told the Globe. \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019ve always been \u2014 fiscally conservative and socially liberal.\u201d Planned Parenthood Action Fund executive director Kelley Robinson criticized Joe Biden for his support of the Hyde Amendment: \u201cTo support the Hyde Amendment is to block people \u2013 particularly women of color and women with low incomes \u2013 from accessing safe, legal abortion. As abortion access is being restricted and pushed out of reach in states around the country, it is unacceptable for a candidate to support policies that further restrict abortion. \u201cThe Democratic Party platform is crystal clear in supporting the right to safe, legal abortion and repealing the Hyde Amendment, a position held by the majority of voters. Supporting Hyde isn\u2019t good policy or politics. We strongly encourage Joe Biden to speak to the people whose lives are impacted by this discriminatory policy and reevaluate his position.\u201d Senior U.S. and military officials are warning Congress about the potential threat to national security from melting ice in the Arctic, the Associated Press reports: Officials from the Office of National Intelligence and the Pentagon say climate change will open the Arctic to more ship traffic and commercial activities by Russia and China and create potential sources of conflict. Peter Kiemel, counselor to the National Intelligence Council, says Russia and China are dramatically increasing their investment there. Jeff Ringhausen, a Navy official, says that though Arctic shipping is likely to increase, it\u2019ll still amount only to a small portion of overall global shipping. He says the Russian government is \u201coverly optimistic\u201d regarding the increased shipping and investment in the Arctic. The witnesses spoke at a hearing on climate change impacts on national security. The Trump administration is canceling English classes, legal aid and recreational programs for unaccompanied immigrant minors staying in federal shelters, the Washington Post reports. The Office of Refugee Resettlement is withdrawing federal funding for activities \u201cnot directly necessary for the protection of life and safety, including education services, legal services, and recreation,\u201d Health and Human Services spokesman Mark Weber told the Post. A lawyer representing immigrant minors vowed to go to court if the cut goes through. A previous federal court ruling mandates education and recreation for minors in federal custody. There are more than 40,800 unaccompanied children in HHS custody. They are mostly teenagers traveling to the US on their own, but during the Trump administration\u2019s since-reversed family separation policy, also included young children taken from their parents. Wisconsin\u2019s state legislature is set to approve several bills to restrict abortion Wednesday, the Associated Press reports. But unlike other states that have recently approved new abortion restrictions, Wisconsin has a Democratic governor, Tony Evers, who has vowed to veto all the measures. And Republicans do not have the votes to override a veto. A rundown of the bills, via AP: One bill up for final approve in the state Senate addresses the extremely rare occurrence in which a baby is born alive during an abortion attempt. It would impose criminal penalties on doctors who fail to give medical care to such babies. Organizations representing obstetricians and gynecologists say existing laws already provide protections to every healthy newborn, whether born during a failed abortion or under other circumstances... Other bills up for approval would cut off Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, prohibit abortions based on the fetus\u2019 race, sex or defects and require providers to tell women seeking abortions using the drug mifepristone that the process may be reversed after the first dose. CNN has identified five instances where Donald Trump planted false stories about members of the British royal family buying or looking at apartments at his properties, or becoming members of his clubs. Another presidential policy plan this morning: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is out with a proposal to legalize marijuana nationwide. She vows to immediately deschedule marijuana as a federal controlled substance, expunge all non-violent marijuana convictions at the federal level, and establish a national process to make marijuana production and consumption \u201cclean, safe, and sustainable.\u201d Donald Trump has wrapped up his trip to the UK after D-Day commemorations Wednesday, and boarded Air Force One to fly to Ireland. He plans to visit the tiny village of Doonbeg, adjacent to his golf course and resort, where many locals consider his business an economic lifeline and he\u2019s not expected to face the kind of protests going on elsewhere in Ireland. Bernie Sanders will attend Walmart\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday to advocate for workers\u2019 rights. The senator and presidential candidate plans to introduce a shareholder resolution that would give hourly employees a seat on the retailer\u2019s board, and push the company to raise wages. Washington governor Jay Inslee released another climate change plan Wednesday morning, the third proposal to tackle the issue from his climate-focused presidential campaign. The plan focuses on restoring the United States\u2019 international climate leadership. It calls for rejoining the Paris climate agreement, and then holding bilateral negotiations with major economic powers to develop more ambitious targets than the ones in the original agreement. It also calls for joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance, which is trying to phase out the use of coal for power, and ending the Trump administration\u2019s promotion of US fossil fuel abroad. Inslee also proposes tariffs on imports from countries that fail to cut carbon emissions. He says the US should include an enforceable emissions standard in trade agreements, and put a \u201ccarbon duty\u201d on imports. Iowa Rep. Steve King is vowing to fight his way back onto the committees he\u2019s been booted from, Politico reports. \u201cIt was a political lynch mob. I had to let the blood cool,\u201d King told Politico. \u201cAnd the blood has now cooled, and now they don\u2019t want to be faced with the reality of what they\u2019ve done.\u201d GOP leaders removed King from his committees over comments suggesting there was nothing wrong with white supremacy, the latest in a history of inflammatory comments. King said the punishment is \u201csomething I will not let go of.\u201d Senator and presidential hopeful Cory Booker proposed a new housing plan Wednesday, calling for a new tax credit for renters. Under the proposal, anyone paying more than 30% of their income on rent would be eligible for a refundable tax credit. The tax credit would cover the difference between 30% of the person\u2019s income and their rent, capped at the federally determined fair market rent for their neighborhood. An estimated 57 million people could benefit from the credit, with the average family getting $4,800 a year. Booker is also proposing requiring cities and towns that want certain federal transportation and housing grants to eliminate restrictive zoning rules in order to make it easier to build affordable housing. The plan calls for a federal fund available to states and cities that guarantee lawyers to tenants facing eviction, as New York City and Booker\u2019s home town of Newark have done. Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke unveiled a sweeping voting rights-based policy plan Tuesday night that promises to ban PAC money from political campaigns, impose term limits on elected officials and Supreme Court justices, and increase voter registration by 50 million by 2024. The plan is made up of three parts: \u201cIncrease participation within our democracy,\u201d \u201cremove barriers within our democracy,\u201d \u201crebuild confidence in our democracy.\u201d \u201cIf we are to reclaim our democracy, we must draw people back into the political process, expand the franchise, and guarantee that every voice counts,\u201d reads an introduction to the plan, which aims to increase voter turnout to 65% \u2014 with 35 million new votes \u2014 by 2024. Under \u201cincreasing participation,\u201d O\u2019Rourke proposes a shift to automatic and same-day voter registration, increased youth outreach and term limits of 12 years (six terms) for House reps, 12 years (two terms) for Senators and 18 years for Supreme Court justices. O\u2019Rourke also proposed making a National Voting Day holiday and introducing legislation to amend the Voting Rights Act, \u201cto make clear that even seemingly race-neutral election regulations are unlawful when they result in disproportionate impact on racial minorities.\u201d Additionally, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s website outlines plans to provide federal funding to improve election infrastructure, enact legislation to prohibit gerrymandering, eliminate the citizenship question on the US Census, and severely restrict corporate money in politics through banning PAC donations to campaigns. The Hill reports that O\u2019Rourke will discuss the proposal at a voting rights-themed town hall in Atlanta tonight. Senators are planning 22 separate resolutions in an attempt to stop US arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the Hill reports. The bipartisan group introducing the measures includes Senator Lindsey Graham, a usual Donald Trump ally who has broken with the president over his support for Saudi Arabia. \u201cWhile I understand that Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally, the behavior of Mohammed bin Salman cannot be ignored,\u201d Graham Wednesday, according to the Hill. \u201cI am also very concerned about the precedent these arms sales would set by having the Administration go around legitimate concerns of the Congress. I expect and look forward to strong bipartisan support for these resolutions of disapproval.\u201d The Border Patrol has been expanding stops and searches of buses and trains to look for undocumented immigrants, NBC News reports. In an email explaining an end to restrictions on the checks, a Border Patrol official signed off: \u201cHappy hunting, stay safe, and have fun!\u201d NARAL is condemning Joe Biden\u2019s support for the Hyde Amendment. President Ilyse Hogue said: \u201cThere\u2019s no political or ideological excuse for Joe Biden\u2019s support for the Hyde Amendment, which translates into discrimination against poor women and women of color plain and simple. His position further endangers women and families already facing enormous hurdles and creates two classes of rights for people in this country, which is inherently undemocratic. At a time where the fundamental freedoms enshrined in Roe are under attack, the 2020 Democratic field has coalesced around the Party\u2019s core values -- support for abortion rights, and the basic truth that reproductive freedom is fundamental to the pursuit of equality and economic security in this country. Differentiating himself from the field this way will not earn Joe Biden any political points and will bring harm to women who are already most vulnerable.\u201d Donald Trump weighed in this morning on the allegations that Joe Biden\u2019s campaign plagiarized parts of his climate change plan, but predicted the \u201cCorrupt Media will save him.\u201d (It was news outlets that made public the apparently lifted sentences). Facing a growing revolt from Republicans opposed to tariffs on Mexico, Donald Trump this morning tweeted what purports to be a statement of support from House minority leader Kevin McCarthy. Former Vice President Joe Biden still supports the Hyde Amendment, the rule banning the use of federal funds for abortion in most cases, his campaign tells NBC News. His support for the rule sets him apart from the rest of the Democratic primary field. Biden supports legal abortion, but as NBC reports, has evolved over the years to be more supportive of abortion rights and says he personally opposes the procedure as a devout Catholic. The Hyde Amendment prohibits using federal funds - including Medicaid - to pay for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the woman. The four female senators running for president - Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar - are co-sponsoring legislation to repeal the amendment. No other Democratic presidential candidate has come out in support of keeping the law. Donald Trump joined world leaders to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day in Portsmouth on the final day of his state visit to the UK. Follow live updates in our UK blog. Trump and Queen Elizabeth greeted D-Day veterans after the ceremony, hearing their stories and thanking them for their service. Trump also had a brief private chat with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is receiving his first union endorsement in his long shot bid for president. New York Hotel and Motel Trades is set to formally endorse de Blasio Wednesday afternoon at its New York headquarters, with president Peter Ward to \u201ctout his pro-worker record as New York City mayor,\u201d according to de Blasio\u2019s campaign. Prince Charles spent the better part of an hour and a half trying to convince Donald Trump that the climate crisis was real, but the president was not sold. Trump dismissed the warming climate as just a \u201cchange in weather\u201d and cast blame on other countries in an interview Wednesday with \u201cGood Morning Britain.\u201d Pressed by host Piers Morgan on whether he personally believes that climate change is real, Trump said: \u201cI believe there\u2019s a change in weather, and I think it changes both ways.\u201d Trump, who has previously called climate change a \u201cChinese hoax,\u201d met for 90 minutes this week with Charles, the Prince of Wales, who has made the climate crisis a signature issue. \u201cWe were going to have a 15 minute chat, and it turned out to be an hour and a half, and he did most of the talking,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe wants to make sure future generations have climate that is good, as opposed to a disaster, and I agree. I did mention a couple of things: I did say, well, the United States right now has among the cleanest climates there are, based on all the statistics, and it\u2019s even gotten better, because I agree with that. I want the best water, the cleanest water, crystal clean air.\u201d Trump has withdrawn the US from its commitments to reduce emissions in the Paris climate accord and rolled back a host of environmental regulations. Morgan invited him to say he accepts the fundamental reality that the planet is heating up. \u201cWhat people want to hear from you about climate change is that you basically understand that almost every scientists that looks into this believes climate change is a very real and present danger, and if we don\u2019t tackle it now...then we\u2019re going to be in serious trouble. Do you accept that?\u201d the host asked. Trump wouldn\u2019t go there, instead calling out other countries for polluted air. \u201cWell, you know, you just said it - China, India, Russia, many other nations, they have not very good air, not very good water,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you go to certain cities, you can\u2019t even breathe.\u201d There\u2019s \u201ca chance\u201d the US will take military action against Iran, Donald Trump said Wednesday. \u201cThere is always a chance. Do I want to? No, I\u2019d rather not. But there\u2019s always a chance,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Piers Morgan. \u201cI\u2019d much rather talk.\u201d Trump also attempted in the interview to clarify his comments saying that Meghan Markle was \u201cnasty.\u201d Told that Markle had called him misogynistic and divisive, Trump said in an interview with the Sun earlier this week: \u201c\u201cI didn\u2019t know that. What can I say? I didn\u2019t know that she was nasty.\u201d Trump said Wednesday that \u201cnasty\u201d was meant to describe her criticisms, rather than the duchess herself. \u201cThey said some of the things that she said and, it\u2019s actually on tape. And I said, \u2018Well, I didn\u2019t know she was nasty.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t referring to she\u2019s nasty. I said she was nasty about me. And, essentially, I didn\u2019t know she was nasty about me,\u201d Trump said in the interview aired Wednesday. \u201cWhat she said was nasty based on what they told me,\u201d he added. \u201cShe was nasty to me, and that\u2019s OK for her to be nasty. It\u2019s not good for me to be nasty to her, and I wasn\u2019t. And in fact I think she\u2019s doing very well.\u201d Donald Trump is facing a growing revolt from Senate Republicans over his plan to put tariffs on Mexican goods. Senators told White House officials at a lunch Tuesday that Trump faces a veto-proof majority to overturn the tariffs, Politico reported. Half a dozen GOP senators stood to speak about why tariffs are a bad idea, according to CNN. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer predicted Trump would not follow through with the threatened 5% tariff, and Trump lashed out at him on Twitter. There\u2019s broad bipartisan opposition in the Senate, Senator Gary Peters told CNBC Wednesday. \u201cMy Republican counterparts are very concerned about these tariffs,\u201d said Peters, the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
