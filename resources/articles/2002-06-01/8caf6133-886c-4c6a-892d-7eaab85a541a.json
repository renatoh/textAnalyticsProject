Early reports indicated that the bomber was the sole fatality. The explosion ripped through a restaurant in the centre of Herzliya, a coastal city just north of Tel Aviv. Rescue services director Avi Zohar said nine people were injured, one seriously. All had been taken to hospitals within minutes after the attack. Joel Leyden, who arrived at the scene minutes after the blast, said the target of the attack was a small Middle East-style restaurant. He said police found another bomb on the assailant's body and were dismantling it after moving people away from the scene. David Baker, an official in the Israeli prime minister's office, denounced the attack: \"The Herzliya terror attack is another example of the Palestinians' intention to commit murder for the sake of murder. \"Palestinian terrorists are bent on obliterating as many Israelis as they possibly can, wherever and whenever they can.\" The bombing took place despite tight Israeli restrictions on movement in the West Bank. Israeli forces have encircled main Palestinian population centres, preventing Palestinians from moving freely around the West Bank, in an attempt to stop infiltration by attackers. Last Wednesday, a Palestinian teenager drove a car bomb from the northern West Bank town of Jenin onto a main Israeli highway and blew up a bus, killing himself and 17 Israelis, most of them Israeli soldiers. The attack led to renewed pressure on the Israeli government to expedite construction of a fence to separate Israel and the West Bank."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
