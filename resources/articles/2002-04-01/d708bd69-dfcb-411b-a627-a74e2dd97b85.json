I was studying photography, and I used to take an aluminium camera case from college and bring it to the Free Trade Hall in Manchester. At the time there were no photo passes and they just let you in because they thought you were from the Manchester Evening News . You could get right down the front without a ticket and no one would bother you. So, when punk started, it was a great chance because suddenly people you were friends with were in bands. A lot of the best rock photos came from that period, when photographers still got to spend a lot of time with bands. It's always worth taking a week to get just one shot, rather than shooting 5,000 pictures in a day without getting the right one. You can see it with Penny Smith's pictures of The Clash. She spent a lot of time with them. You're more likely to get a perfect picture that way than if you're thrust into a hotel room to do a shoot in five minutes with a host of PR people around you. A perfect rock photo can define an era, although the people involved don't realise it at the time. Mick Rock's pictures of David Bowie as Ziggy Stardust defined the glam period because most people were still shooting in black and white but Bowie's over-the-top look lent itself to colour. Musicians themselves help to create the perfect photograph because most people who want to be a lead singer tend to be very vain. That's why Morrissey made a great subject because he always had ideas for pictures. Brett Anderson of Suede knew how he wanted to look and we put a large mirror by the side of the camera so he could check how he looked while I was shooting. You've got to have a certain amount of self-belief to be in the perfect rock photo. \u00b7 Kevin Cummins is a photographer. His new book, The Smiths and Beyond (\u00a312.99, Vision On) is out now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
