Moshiri has so far invested \u00a3400m in Everton, including a fresh injection of \u00a350m last month, and plans to further demonstrate his financial commitment through a share issue that represents an additional \u00a3250m of investment. Depending on the terms agreed, the \u00a3250m will include the conversion of previous loans by Moshiri into equity and an estimated \u00a350m of new cash this season. The billionaire\u2019s shareholding will increase from 77.2% to more than 93% should the share issue proposal be accepted in full. Everton\u2019s net debt decreased from \u00a39.2m to \u00a32.3m due to another \u00a350m from Moshiri and the club insist they remain on a secure financial footing and on course to build a new \u00a3500m stadium at Bramley Moore dock. The net loss includes \u00a319.9m spent on preparation work for the new stadium but, until planning permission is obtained, the sum cannot be capitalised on to the balance sheet. Other exceptional items include the \u00a36.5m cost of paying off Marco Silva following his sacking as manager last December. The Premier League has estimated that clubs are suffering a collective loss of \u00a3100m per month as a result of the pandemic and Everton\u2019s broadcast revenue alone decreased from \u00a3132.7m in 2018-19 to \u00a398m. This figure includes the rebate paid to broadcasters due to the delayed finish to the season, and the result of some matches being postponed until the new financial year. Everton also invested a further \u00a370m on players under the new manager, Carlo Ancelotti, for the 2020-21 season. Over the past three financial years Everton have posted combined losses of almost \u00a3265m (\u00a3139.9m in 2019-20, \u00a3111.8m in 2018-19 and \u00a313.1m in 2017-18). That breaches Premier League profit and sustainability rules allowing for a loss of \u00a3105m over three years, although that is a pre-Covid figure and restrictions have been relaxed as a result of the pandemic. Everton\u2019s chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, said: \u201cClearly this has been a very challenging year, not least from a financial perspective with the impact of Covid-19 having a profound, wide-reaching and material impact on our figures. Prior to the pandemic, we were forecasting record revenues in excess of \u00a3200m. Our final accounts show that a significant proportion of our losses have been directly attributable to the pandemic. \u201cHowever, in this period, it is encouraging that our commercial performance has improved markedly, and this will continue to be a priority moving forward. We have also continued our investment into both our new stadium project \u2013 which continues to progress in line with our project plan \u2013 and, importantly, in strengthening our management and playing staff through the arrival of Carlo Ancelotti and some key additions to our first-team squad. \u201cThese strategically important projects have been enabled by our majority shareholder, who has further underlined his commitment with additional investment into the club, in 2019-20 and into this financial year.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
