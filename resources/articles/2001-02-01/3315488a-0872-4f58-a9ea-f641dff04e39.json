A full transcript of the unedited interview found its way onto emails around the country, causing uproar at the BBC. The transcript begun appearing on the internet today and the Daily Mail has also published extracts. FHM was the first to obtain a leak and its website was among several to have posted the full script today. MediaGuardian.co.uk also ran the transcript before being ordered to pull it down by BBC lawyers. But the BBC does not believe an insider is to blame. \"Someone who watched the interview being filmed must have smuggled in a tape recorder,\" said the spokeswoman. \"We don't produce transcripts until after a show is edited.\" The no-holds-barred interview has Ali G ask a shocked David Beckham if he would rather be married to Baby Spice. But it's Sporty Spice who comes in for the most abuse. At one point Ali G asks Beckham: \"You is the best at football, ya know. \"So you get Posh. So does Sporty Spice go out with someone from Scunthorpe United?\" Later, he asks Posh whether she thought she ought to put on some weight, adding that of course she shouldn't go as far as Sporty Spice. But many of the more offensive - and funny - sections will never reach our screens. The BBC is planning to edit out references to Sporty Spice, among others. And it has set its lawyers on to anyone who tries to publish the leaked transcript. \"We're incredibly unhappy about all this,\" said a BBC spokeswoman. \"Comic Relief was planning to publish bits of the show in the run-up to the broadcast to attract people to its website, which would have brought in extra income to the charity. \"People seeing it beforehand ruins that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
