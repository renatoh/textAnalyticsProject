I think the moral of the story was that being a woman is hard. Anyway, thanks for reading and commenting. If you want to follow me on Twitter, I\u2019m @StuHeritage. I\u2019ll be back here next week to liveblog something else, because that's how these things work. Goodnight. Now it's just Margaret Thatcher. No Denis. No power. No Bollywood. She can hear the birdsong really clearly again, which means her superpowers must be returning. And just in time, because that's the end of the film. Denis is now walking away from Margaret, possibly forever. It's actually a little bit heartbreaking. It's the Hanks/Wilson scene from Castaway, essentially. Someone should give Meryl Streep an Oscar. And for some reason, this has snapped Old Thatcher out of her malaise. She's tidying everything up, and all because we've been treated to an annoyingly lightweight flashback of her entire life. All that's left in this Dewey Coxification is for her to sing Beautiful Ride and it'll all be over. Now Old Thatcher is chanting the word 'Weak' and tipping over a load of shoes. This, truly, is the revenge that she's always been capable of. She's taken his advice, and she's resigned. But it's not all bad news because she got a radio out of it. What should she do? Denis urges her to resign. But he's dead. He might have been dead back then too. He might have always been dead. I'm starting to think that Denis has been Bruce Willising Margaret Thatcher for her whole life. Thatcher is now in the midst of her leadership crisis. But, instead of putting her party in order, she goes to Paris to attend a Dress Up Like Anne Robinson From The Weakest Link banquet. And, as a result, things fall apart. Geoffrey Howe has now resigned from the cabinet. He's citing difference of opinion, but everyone knows he just wants to go and mentor a teenage vampire slayer. Oh. Poll tax riots. I didn't see that coming. This part of the film goes like this: EVERYONE: \"The poll tax is a stupid idea\" MARGARET THATCHER: \"The poll tax is a brilliant idea! I love the poll tax! You are all massive douchebags for not liking the poll tax! What could possibly go wrong?\" Everyone covers their eyes and shakes their heads in an act of pretend disappointment. That section of history over, Margaret Thatcher looks at a badly photoshopped picture of Meryl Streep's face next to Ronald Reagan's face and suddenly there's a montage of Thatcher and Reagan dancing while the Berlin Wall falls. I think she's about to look at an ornament of a career-destroying decision to initiate a poll tax, because I smell trouble. Apparently Margaret Thatcher spent most of the Falklands War sitting at a desk writing letters. Who knew? Anyway, it worked because now everywhere's covered in Union Jacks and loads of old men are drinking champagne and guffawing. Winning wars is brilliant, isn't it? Hey, good guess, me. Thatcher's tracking The Belgrano now. Prediction: this will end horribly. Everyone says \"Hey, let's not start a war, Margaret\". But she really, really wants a war. She really means it, too. She doesn't even look as if she's ready to burst into song. This is serious. During a dance with her dead husband, Old Thatcher falls and sees a military ornament, and immediately zooms away to a flashback about the Falklands. Which is handy because, chronologically, that's where this bit should go. \"Did you know Yul Brynner was a GYPSY?\" asks Dead Denis. Never mind The Iron Lady, I want to see a spin-off exclusively about Denis Thatcher traveling around the country being bewildered by non-whites. That was actually a pretty good depiction of a bombing. Just a bang, and broken glass, and a room caving in without a fuss. Given that just I watched the bit of Fair Game where Cindy Crawford's house blows up and she cartwheels through the air from three storeys up, lands in a lake and then brushes herself down without any visible injury, I can say with some authority that this is better. Although maybe not quite as funny. She's staying at the Grand Hotel now. Prediction: this will end horribly. Now there are riots. And miners' strikes. And tussles with the police. And bombings. And extras with bad haircuts tutting at her as she drives past in a car. Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the Dark Years. \"The medicine is harsh, but the patient requires it to live\". Again, that's something I say, but to myself. About cake. We're in the part of history where everyone hates Margaret Thatcher, but it's OK because she knows how much margarine costs. She's in bed now, reciting favourable headlines out loud to herself for comfort. I do that, you know, but with comments. Thatcher knows that she's imagining Denis. She tries to wish him away. But he refuses. It's a bit like Fight Club, this bit. Perhaps at the end we'll find out that Margaret and Denis were the same people all along. Perhaps they're going to blow up a skyscraper and listen to the Pixies, too. The doctor's asked her about her personal manifesto. \"Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering\" she tells him, right before having an acrobatic lightsaber fight with Christopher Lee. Oh, the film's still on. Old Thatcher's talking to a doctor about how she donated all of Denis's things to Oxfam. His suits, his shoes, his ill-advised ironic turbans. The lot. She's prime minister now. She marches up to the front door of 10 Downing Street with intent and purpose, orders all her ministers to smile nicely for the photographers, and now she's old again. That was a short film. Goodnight everyone! Oh wait, her friend's just been blown up by the IRA. Now she's really going to run the country. I was right, more or less. There she is, dressed up as an ice cream man. Now there she is, in a hard hat. There she is, being spun around underneath a blowdryer. There she is, wearing rollerskates and bodypopping. Now for the wacky makeover sequence. Two party advisors are crowding into her, telling her to lower her voice and stop wearing hats. We are approximately two seconds away from a changing room montage, where Margaret Thatcher dresses in a number of kooky outfits, and several senior members of the Conservative party cover their eyes and shake their heads in an act of pretend disappointment. This whole film is basically 'Can a woman balance work and family?'. It's basically every article that Red magazine has ever published. Margaret Thatcher's decided to run for leader of the Conservative party. But it takes a while for her to announce this to her family because Denis is trying to cook his own breakfast and he's being all 'dur dur dur' about it. She's ranting on about reaffirming Conservative principles and he's all like \"Doy, how do eggs work?\" During a cabinet discussion about the union strikes of the 1970s, the word 'compromise' echoes around Thatcher's head. This might come back later in the film, or maybe she just really likes the sound of the word. I don't know. She's finally in the House of Commons, as education secretary. But she's making a number of silly mistakes. First, her voice is too high. Second, she's wearing a funny hat. Third, she seems to be making a number of points suggesting that children need food and warmth, which seems a little uncharacteristic. It's OK though because - SPOILER ALERT \u2013 she gets better at it. Next in the Dewy Coxification of Margaret Thatcher's life: the bit where she has children who do nothing but exclusively run around sepia-toned paradise-scapes in slow motion shouting with joy. And then the bit where she's elected as an MP and her children immediately start running around gloomy hellscapes in slow motion shouting \"Where's my mummy? I miss my mummy!' Incidentally, if you ever ask Margaret Thatcher to marry you, there's a pretty good chance that she'll bang on for ten straight minutes about her burning desire to rule the world. So, you know, think twice. Now she's remembering the time that she lost her first election, which was notable for crap bunting and Denis Thatcher proposing to her. He asks her in his normal English accent, which is good because I was starting to suspect that he'd do it while pulling his eyes across his face with his fingers to make him look Chinese or something. Her wish might have been to to remember the time that she went to the opera and Denis gave her a sugar mouse, because that's what she's doing. And now I want a sugar mouse. Carol Thatcher just told her mum to make a wish, and she did the exact same thing that a three-year-old would do if you told them to make a wish. I swear to god, this film is one bad decision away from having Thatcher bomb around London on a flying umbrella. Young Thatcher offers her opinion and is scoffed at. Old Thatcher is asked her opinion and gets her bum licked whatever she says. They are two different women united by time. It's what Slaughterhouse Five would be like if Billy Pilgrim had been married to a man who was fond of unfortunately racist impressions of Indian people. Thatcher is now simultaneously attending two dinner parties; one in her current day decrepit state, and one as a young lady. Neither one looks like much fun. The subtext here would seem to be that Margaret Thatcher's life was defined by rubbish dinner parties that were full of idiots. Already, I'm quite taken with Meryl Streep's performance. She's got Old Thatcher down almost perfectly. If it wasn't for my suspicion that she's desperate to jump up and dance around singing a happy song about the importance of keeping busy like Mary Poppins, I'd be completely sold. And here's Olivia Colman as Carol Thatcher. She's basically incomprehensible, so it's a pretty accurate portrayal. Oh. Close. She's gone back to her childhood. Her past was a woozy mish-mash of horn-rimmed glasses and obsessively staring at shoes and being at a theatrical remove from her parents at all times. It looks a bit crap, to be honest. Another one of her talents: being able to travel back in time when she hears specific codewords. One of them is apparently 'Rogers and Hammerstein', and it takes her back to the time she went to a Rogers and Hammerstein concert. If she hears it again, I'm guessing that she'll go back to the age of the dinosaurs. Denis keeps appearing and advising Thatcher from beyond the grave. He's a bit like Dexter's Dad in that respect. Perhaps she really is a serial killer after all. And she sees dead people. She just had a long conversation with Denis, even though he's not alive any more. Part Spider-Man, part Sixth Sense. I like this film already. Especially if it turns out that she's been sent back from the future to kill someone. Hey, it's Margaret Thatcher as an old lady. She's buying some milk and listening to Bollywood music. The milk seems slightly too expensive for her. Also, she hears the ambient noises around her much more sharply than everyone. I wonder if the twist of this film is that she's actually Spider-Man. OK, here we go. Ladies and gentlemen, The Iron Lady. Sponsored by some chips. Apparently it was easier for her to play Old Thatcher because she was more human, and politicians make barnyard noises. That's all I've been able to take from this. Oh, before The Iron Lady starts, Meryl Streep's doing a special 10-minute thing about her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher. That's something, surely. Good evening everyone, and welcome to this evening\u2019s Film on the Box liveblog. Tonight at 9pm, I will be taking you by the hand at guiding you through Film4\u2019s screening of The Iron Lady, aka The Devil Wears Pussybow. I\u2019m going to have to level with you here. I've never seen The Iron Lady before. I\u2019m going into this completely cold. And, since I ended up crying and begging for mercy last time I liveblogged a Meryl Streep film, I\u2019m a little bit nervous about it. Pierce Brosnan doesn\u2019t sing in this one, does he? He doesn\u2019t play a singing version of Leon Brittan in it, does he? Still, The Iron Lady. Obviously it\u2019s Phyllida Lloyd\u2019s Margaret Thatcher biopic, and obviously Meryl Streep\u2019s in it. She won an Oscar for her portrayal of Thatcher, and Abi Morgan won a BAFTA for the script. That said, the film\u2019s only got a middling Rotten Tomatoes score, which seems to be down to the fact that nobody can work out if it's too harsh on Thatcher or not harsh enough. If only it had been written by The Daily Mail, or whoever did the graffiti on the wall next to my local Sainsbury\u2019s right after she died. That would have been a film. The Iron Lady starts on Film4 at 9pm. Here\u2019s the trailer:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
