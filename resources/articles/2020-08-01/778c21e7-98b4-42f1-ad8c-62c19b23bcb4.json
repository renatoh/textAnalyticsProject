Top stories An infectious disease specialist hired to work in Melbourne\u2019s public housing towers during hard lockdown has called the police presence \u201cdeeply dehumanising\u201d, saying the failure to heed the practical living experience of tenants left him \u201cfurious\u201d. \u201cYou had this huge response with police everywhere, apparently to protect \u2018vulnerable people\u2019 who are in fact actually very capable people living in a vulnerable environment,\u201d Dr Chris Lemoh has said.

Delegations from the two countries will meet over coming weeks to establish reciprocal embassies and discuss \u201careas of mutual benefit\u201d. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign for the White House has been buoyed by donor pledges of more than $26m within a single day.

Biden and Harris called for a nationwide mask mandate as the US announced its worst single-day coronavirus death toll in almost three months, with 1,468 deaths confirmed and 53,758 new positive infections recorded.

Recommended reads While \u201cNobody sings Dylan like Dylan\u201d, it\u2019s worth remembering that many of the famous singer-songwriter\u2019s songs became legendary thanks to others. In the steps of the Byrds, Peter, Paul and Mary, and David Bowie, therefore, comes an understated Australian, Emma Swift, whose new album, Blonde on the Tracks, is earning rave reviews.
