They have lost their last seven matches and here they were beaten by a Barbarians side that was out until the small hours of Saturday morning enjoying Cardiff's hospitality. Wales talk a good game but you would never have guessed they had spent the previous three weeks in camp. The players spent much of that time arguing against a restructuring of their pay and, implicitly, threatening industrial action. \"I do not answer stupid questions,\" said the national coach Steve Hansen when asked if all his players would be taking off for Australia today and the Welsh Rugby Union admitted it had still to reach agreement with the squad. There is a lack of harmony about Wales and what the Barbarians expected to be the toughest of their three matches turned into the most comfortable victory. \"We were out until 3am on the morning of the game but we had prepared well,\" said the South Africa No8 AJ Venter. \"It was our third Test in seven days and I would not say we followed the professional route in terms of our preparation,\" admitted the Barbarians' coach Alan Solomons. The Barbarians made their name through the breadth of their vision, but they chose two wings on Saturday who were more comfortable trying to charge through opponents than run round them and the 80 minutes proved more of a fast than a feast. There were moments of individual skill, most notably from the Wales centre Iestyn Harris, but they were lost in the ordinariness of the occasion. The WRU sold the match as the 100th and final appearance of Neil Jenkins in a red jersey. He came on with 15 minutes left and kicked the final points with a trademark wide-angled conversion. Otherwise the crowd was short-changed.
