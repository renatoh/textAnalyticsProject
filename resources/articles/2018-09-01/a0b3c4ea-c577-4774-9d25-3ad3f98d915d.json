Proposals for an independent public advocate are outlined in a broader consultation on improving the rights of victims. The Ministry of Justice will also consult on the creation of a \u201cvictims\u2019 law\u201d \u2013 a promise repeatedly made at party conferences \u2013 and upgrade waiting areas for victims and witnesses in courthouses. The MoJ said an independent public advocate would help guide bereaved families through any investigative process after a disaster \u201cso their voices can be heard at inquest\u201d. Although the title includes the term \u201cadvocate\u201d, the official will not represent bereaved families at inquiries or inquests. The strategy document acknowledges there is \u201csome potential for confusion\u201d. A separate debate about how to fund lawyers for bereaved families at inquests is not yet resolved. Other measures proposed include: \u2022 Extending the unduly lenient sentence scheme to the court of appeal, enabling victims and the public to pursue requests for harsher sentences further through the court system. \u2022 Boosting by 25% the number of registered intermediaries \u2013 communication experts who help vulnerable victims and witnesses give evidence in police interviews and trials. \u2022 Reviewing the criminal injuries compensation scheme (CICS) and considering abolition of the pre-1979 \u201csame roof rule\u201d, which prevented payments from being made to victims who lived in the same home as their attacker. The consultation, which will run until early December, follows criticism of the handling of victims of the Grenfell Tower fire last year and a damning report on the experience of relatives of the 96 Hillsborough victims. In a foreword, the justice minister Edward Argar said: \u201cIt is clear there remain serious concerns about how far the voices of the bereaved are heard, and how far they are supported in fully understanding and participating in the investigatory process.\u201d Theresa May said: \u201cNothing can take away the distress and trauma of being a victim of crime, but ensuring people get the support they need as they rebuild their lives is vital. How we support victims is fundamental to a caring society, and in recognition of that we are taking steps to enshrine their rights in law for the very first time.\u201d The justice secretary, David Gauke, said: \u201cMany of us will be lucky enough to not have to encounter the justice system as a victim of crime, but those who do must not also become a victim of the process.\u201d Helen Newlove, the victims commissioner for England and Wales, said: \u201cThis is a timely focus on the needs and rights of victims, and is a major step forward towards ensuring they receive the care, support and justice they deserve. \u201cVictims consistently tell me that they feel their status in the criminal justice system is not comparable with that of the offender. As victims commissioner I have long been calling for a victims\u2019 law to ensure that the rights of victims are central to the delivery of our justice system.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
