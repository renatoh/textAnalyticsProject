Although the smart money in Downing Street will remain on May 3, the strong lead gives added impetus to go to the polls sooner rather than later. Results in line with the poll would deliver a second land slide victory for Mr Blair almost on the scale of the 1997 historic win - if he can get the potential Labour vote to the polling stations on the day. The detailed results of the ICM poll neatly encapsulate the dilemma facing the prime minister. While the Labour lead is at its highest level for more than a year, it also shows that the numbers of those who say they are certain to vote has dropped three points since last month. The poll underlines Labour fears that it is \"stay-at-homes\" who pose the main threat to the scale of its second-term victory, on the basis that the more likely a landslide appears, the fewer people will bother to take part in what they see as a foregone conclusion. Ministers must also privately doubt if this political momentum can be sustained for a further 10 weeks in the run-up to a May 3 election. The poll shows that despite a month of indifferent headlines for Mr Blair, including the Mandelson resignation and the dome sale, Labour is actually up three points to 47% and the Tories are down two points to 32%, suggesting that the formidable economic feel good factor is responsible more than anything for fuelling this renewed resurgence in the government's fortunes. Labour's dominance on the economy is underscored by the poll finding that 33% regard it as the best party to manage the economy, double the 16% who believe the Tories would be more competent on an issue that was traditionally one of their strengths. The 15-point lead, which is larger than the margin by which Labour won the 1997 general election, is all the more impressive because ICM customarily records a lower share of the vote for Labour than other opinion polls, as it adjusts for a \"shy Tory\" factor. The poll also shows that the overwhelming majority, 64%, believe that Mr Blair was right to ask for the resignation of Mr Mandelson. Only 14% of voters say he was wrong. It reveals that the government has firmly nailed any lingering reputation Labour had as the party of public spending. The voters regard both main parties as equally likely to raise taxes. In February 1997, when the question was last asked, 49% said they expected that Labour would spend more than the Tories if elected. That figure has now fallen to only 24% of voters and in fact a slightly higher proportion, 29%, believe that the Tories would spend more than Labour if they won. A further 25% believe public spending will be at roughly the same level whichever party gets in. The main switch in opinion has been the growth of scepticism about Labour's future spending plans, with the \"don't knows\" growing from 6% in February 1997 to 22% now. This indicates how' expectations of a big boost in public spending during a second-term Labour government have receded. As for the Tories, 38% expect them to increase public spending if elected and only 23% to cut current levels. On tax Labour is now seen as little different from the Conservatives. Both parties are expected to raise taxes if they are elected, with only 20% saying they believe the Tories would cut the overall tax burden. \u0095 ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,000 adults by telephone from February 16-18.
