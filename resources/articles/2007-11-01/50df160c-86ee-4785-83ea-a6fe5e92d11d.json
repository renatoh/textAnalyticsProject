L&amp;G should have paid me interest for the period of the delay. When it didn't, I contacted The Pensions Advisory Service (TPAS) for help. TPAS has spent months trying to get my money from L&amp;G, but has given up in exasperation. MS, Aberdeen Legal &amp; General has made delay a feature of your case. I, too, had to wait weeks for a response because my request had also been overlooked. L&amp;G had initially argued that it should calculate this interest starting three weeks later than your new provider, Hargreaves Lansdown, said. But then, without telling anyone, it decided to pay you no interest at all. The stock market had risen during the four months you had waited for L&amp;G to transfer your pension and you received an extra \u00a3638. L&amp;G decided this outweighed the \u00a3339 interest you were claiming. It closed the file and, assuming there was nothing more to be said, ignored all further letters from TPAS. At this stage, your complaint had not even been filed as a complaint, so no one was investigating that either. L&amp;G blames this on the fact that the original approach came through TPAS, so its administration department treated it as a technical query instead of a complaint. L&amp;G is tightening this loophole. L&amp;G has finally decided there is no justification in continuing to argue about the interest. It is paying you \u00a3339 plus \u00a314 interest on that interest. You will also receive \u00a3200 in compensation. L&amp;G will also grovel to the advisory service. TPAS gives free advice on pensions at www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk. Will Co-op rule mean I'm on a loser with raffle tickets? The Co-op Bank has changed its terms and conditions so that any betting, gaming or wagering by credit card, including buying raffle tickets, is treated as a cash transaction with no interest-free period, a fee and a higher interest rate. I often buy charity raffle tickets and round up the amount to include a donation to the charity. How will the Co-op deal with that? DL, Canterbury You should be all right. Each retailer has a merchant category code (MCC) and, at the Co-op, MCC 7995 indicates betting including lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, off-track betting and wagers at racecourses. The bank says your charity transactions went through on MCC 8398 (charitable and social service organisations). Most credit cards now treat betting this way. MyTravel honours 'lost' discount voucher I booked a holiday to Florida with MyTravel and sent a \u00a3100 discount voucher by recorded delivery. MyTravel lost the voucher, but seems to have no inclination to trace the person who signed for it. MW, Ruthin, Denbighshire MyTravel says it didn't lose the voucher but, for no apparent reason, it was not credited to your booking. It is now. Halifax plays hardball over card bill delayed by strike I received no mail for nine days during the postal strike, so my Halifax credit card bill turned up three days before payment was due. My bank said the money would reach the Halifax a day late, so I rang Halifax to explain, but it was adamant it would charge a \u00a312 late fee and my credit rating would incur a comment. I drove seven miles to the branch and used cash to pay the bill in time. JR, Ormskirk, Lancashire Halifax claims to look individually at each payment delayed by the postal strike, but it insists you were given correct advice and that it was reasonable to expect you to visit the branch. You could set up a direct debit to pay the bill so that you will always be covered. Banks have discretion about how promptly they must report late payers and can allow a seven- to 10-day period of grace. But Halifax confirms that late payment fees are charged immediately. \u00b7 Email Margaret Dibben at money.writes@observer.co.uk or write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 3-7 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5EJ, and include a telephone number.
