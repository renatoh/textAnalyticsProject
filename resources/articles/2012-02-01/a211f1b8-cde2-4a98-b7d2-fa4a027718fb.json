We have an option \u2013 to move our money, but few of us actually do. In fact, we are more likely to divorce than change our bank account, and this despite a growing list of grievances. Forget bank charges, bonuses or lending droughts. Bankers triggered a world recession in 2009 and could well cause a double-dip recession in Britain. What to do? Last week a national campaign was launched to improve the banking system by exercising consumer choice. Move Your Money UK, based on a similar campaign in the US, aims to channel anger into action, by encouraging account holders to move from the big guys to credit unions, ethical banks and building societies, from Potter to George Bailey.
