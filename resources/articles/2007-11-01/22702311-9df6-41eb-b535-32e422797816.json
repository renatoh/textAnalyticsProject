Liz Lightfoot reports.", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/nov/13/schools.uk2", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2007/nov/13/schools.uk2", "fields": {"headline": "Where's my lunch?", "bodyText": "It may not be what teachers want to hear, but one of the things children like most about school is the lunchbreak. It gives them time to eat, build up their social circle, play sport, attend clubs or just run about in the playground. But the traditional dinner hour is becoming a thing of the past. A recent survey found that children are given only 30 minutes for lunch at 13% of secondary schools, and that half of UK secondaries have less than an hour. Some primary schools are beginning to follow the trend. The change is being brought in quietly, usually without consultation with parents, by headteachers who see a shorter break as a behaviour management tool. It cuts down on bullying and fights in the playground, because pupils have less time to get into trouble, they say. But anything less than an hour is not long enough, say teenagers at one large comprehensive school in south-west London that reduced their lunchbreak and shaved 15 minutes off the end of the school day. Jasmine, 15, says: \"We get 40 minutes, but it takes five minutes to pack up and get to the canteen and five minutes to get back to your classroom, so it works out at 30 minutes. You spend your whole time looking at your watch. There's not time to do anything much.\" The death of the lunch hour has coincided with revised teachers' contracts brought in four years ago, which say schools cannot use staff as lunchtime supervisors unless they are part of the senior management team. Instead, they must use support staff, or employ part-time supervisors. But the most common reason given for the change is the reduction of unruly behaviour. \"Essentially, it's saying that we can't do anything about the behaviour at breaks, so we'll shorten them instead,\" says Margaret Morrissey, spokeswoman for the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations. \"I feel cross this has happened with no consultation and, seemingly, with the sanction of government. For most youngsters, the important meal of the day is lunch, because many are too tired to eat at night. When the government is forever trumpeting the health of the nation and promoting healthy food, it seems bizarre to reduce lunchtimes so children do not have the time to eat it,\" she says. Shorter lunchtimes are particularly worrying for parents of primary-aged children. \"Little ones take longer to eat, and they need to be given time to socialise with others and learn to be independent,\" Morrissey says. It's lunchtime at Jasmine's comprehensive. A group of teenagers have commandeered a favourite spot under a tree. Around half are eating. \"We'd all rather have longer at lunch, even if it means leaving school a bit later,\" says Harry, 14. \"Sometimes you get out late for lunch because the teacher is giving out homework, or there's a detention, and then the queues in the canteen are so massive you don't bother to eat.\" Their school reduced the lunchbreak three years ago because of the difficulty of finding lunchtime supervisors able to keep order and ensure the children's safety on a large site. The head, deputies and heads of departments supervise the shorter break. Brendan, 15, eats his lunch on the way home, because he does rugby practice at lunchtimes. \"If you don't go to practice, you can't be in the team. And if you're late back to lessons, you get into trouble.\" Ling, 13, says he has had to give up chess club. \"My mum went mad because I didn't eat my sandwiches, and said I'd got to eat them while I was playing chess. But they don't allow it, so I stopped.\" A report by Ofsted last month says short lunchbreaks are contributing to the decline in school meal take-up since the introduction of the new nutritional guidelines and healthier dinners. It says the number of pupils eating school meals is down in most of schools it visited. \"One of the greatest weaknesses in secondary schools was the very short amount of time allowed for the lunchtime break. This meant that pupils had to be hurried through the canteen at great speed, with no opportunity for them to develop their social skills,\" says the report, Food in Schools: Encouraging Healthier Eating. Pupils find the lunchbreak too short to eat a meal comfortably and socialise with friends, it says. \"Consequently, they preferred to bring sandwiches, which could be eaten quickly where and when they chose. Although these factors may have been an issue before the introduction of the new standards, if they are not addressed, the take-up of school meals will not increase and the impact of the new standards will continue to be minimal.\" Catering companies are also complaining. Sandra Russell, chairman of the Local Authority Caterers' Association (Laca), says lunchtime should be seen as part of the school day. \"Headteachers need to be more aware of the pressure a shortened lunchbreak places on the ability of caterers to turn around a civilised service that entices young people into the dining room to eat well. Half an hour is insufficient time.\" Short lunchbreaks militate against the new emphasis on extra-curricular activities, because there is less time for clubs or sport, say schools resisting the change. Derek Greenup, the head of William Parker sports college, a boys' comprehensive in Hastings, East Sussex, says it's crucial for pupils and teachers to have time to socialise and unwind. \"How many schools have an hour for lunch nowadays? It's being done for behaviour reasons, but there's not time in half an hour for pupils to sit together, or walk together, or play sport together. We think it is incredibly important that the children have time to discuss issues of the day, and eat properly in a sensible way.\" Lunchtime supervision is carried out by the senior management team and supervisors who are brought in and trained. \"We get to know the pupils, and see what is going on. It gives us some fresh air as well,\" he says. \"You can see at last 500 boys out there on the field today playing football, tag rugby and basketball games that they've set up themselves.\" One of the most popular lunchtime activities is the inter-house tug-of-war competition. But if pupils in the UK think they are hard done by, they can take comfort from the fact that they still get longer than their counterparts at some US schools, where lunchbreaks have been cut to 15 minutes to allow more time for lessons. \u00b7 Names of pupils have been changed"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
