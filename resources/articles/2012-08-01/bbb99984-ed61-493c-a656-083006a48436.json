How could it be otherwise? The expectations that have been heaped on the head of the European Central Bank are so outsize that it is impossible for any official, however ingenious or heroic, to meet them. Yet still economists ask whether the ECB will \"save the day\", while blogs pant over a \"game-changing solution\" to the euro crisis. Much of this breathlessness, it is true, has been caused by Mr Draghi himself. It was he who last week promised to do \"whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.\" A marvellously suggestive phrase, it has sparked one of those periods common before the outbreak of the banking crisis, but now all too rare: that of restive financial markets pausing their hubbub and actually listening to someone in charge. Bond yields, for instance, have dropped like a stone: from above 7% last week, the interest on a 10-year loan to the Spanish government is down to 6.6%.Seeing as Berlin can still tap up markets for a 10-year loan at 1.3%, this is hardly the convergence of European monetary union as it was known for most of the last decade \u2013 but it is still a respite from months of panic. Yet it is hard to see how Mr Draghi and his ECB colleagues can live up to the hype. They might very well cut interest rates further \u2013 but by now that is precisely the kind of \"pushing on a piece of string\" that Keynes talked about when discussing the limitations of monetary policy amid crisis. More boldly, the ECB might announce another big doling out of ultra-cheap loans to banks, otherwise known as a long-term refinancing operation. The bank has done two LTRO rounds already, lending out about a trillion euros in just two days. Another round would certainly keep Spanish and Italian banks upright for a little longer \u2013 which in turn would enable them to keep lending money to the governments of Madrid and Rome, in the kind of crazy Ponzi scheme that in southern Europe now counts for financial stability. Being a smarter and far more innovative thinker than his predecessors at the ECB, Mr Draghi would not have just blurted out a promise to do \"whatever it takes\"; he and his colleagues have been working towards a plan, even if it is unlikely that it will be launched in the dead of summer when most of the continent's power-brokers are on holiday. The other big roadblock to any great fireworks today is Jens Weidmann, the head of the German Bundesbank. Any time it looks as if some big leap forward is even being considered by his central-banker colleagues, Mr Weidmann trips them up. He was on form on Wednesday, with a warning that \"policymakers \u2026overestimate the central bank's possibilities and expect too much of it\". Taken literally, Mr Weidmann is right. The problems of the eurozone go way beyond the kind of technical solutions that can be offered by the ECB or any central bank. They are ultimately political; and the reason the spotlight is concentrated on Mr Draghi is the same reason he is bound to disappoint: because his elevation to supreme importance is a function of the politicians' inability to act. The wobbles over the euro would not have been so fierce over the past few weeks were it not for persistent hints from northern European officials and politicians that Greece might leave the euro. The anxiety over Madrid would not be so great were it not for the fact that prime minister Mariano Rajoy is now having to drive through an impossible austerity programme \u2013 and to take on nearly bankrupt regional governments. And the sense of euro drift would not be so acute had governments fleshed out their agreement to a banking union. The reason so much hope is focused on Mr Draghi is that he at least recognises that solving the euro crisis will take more than promises to act; it will require decisiveness, strategy and execution. The eurozone's ruling class is poor on all three."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
