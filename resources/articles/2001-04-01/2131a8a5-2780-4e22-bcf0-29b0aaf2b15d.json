SABC's live broadcast from the stadium showed bodies strewn on the field, covered in blankets. The stampede is reported to have occurred when spectators tried to barge into an already full Ellis Park stadium to watch the national league match between the Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. SABC said too many tickets had been sold for the game and that fifteen of the bodies were found outside the ground after being trapped against barbed wire when trying to push their way in. Scores of people were injured, but rescue services were hampered by traffic gridlock outside Ellis Park. Casualties were instead carried on stretchers to medical helicopters. Officials expect more fatalities once the body count had been finalised."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
