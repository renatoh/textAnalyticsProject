In the quarter-century since that debut, her voice has deepened and strengthened as its subject matter has widened from bereavement and life in a psychiatric unit to more general difficulties with men, family relationships, and the business of living. The simultaneous publication of Hill's new collection The Hat, and a Selected Poems, Gloria, is the perfect moment to rediscover this inimitably exhilarating poet. Despite her thematic preoccupations, there's nothing conscientious or worthy about Hill's work. She is a flamboyant, exuberant writer who seems effortlessly to juggle her outrageous symbolic lexicon. The Hat offers the reader a set of gleaming miniatures, only two of them more than 10 lines long. Gold snails, \"bejewelled\" trout, horses, cows and cowboy country are among recurring tropes which, repeatedly rearranged, reveal a ceaselessly innovative mind at work. For Hill, such rearrangement is metamorphosis. The same gold snails which rest \"deep within the glades of giant rhubarb leaves\" in \"The Holy Brains of Snails\" \"encrust\" a husband's body, and \"used to grace the mouths of billionaires\" in \"Aeroplane\". Image pivots into further image, as if these transformations might continue indefinitely: Her heart is like a room full of roses that fall apart like dry white wounds; her heart is like a garden full of wounds that know that pain needs them and aches for them (\"Violence\") Such rapid transitions are disciplined in register and coherent in both thought and symbol. \"Goose Feathers\", with its explicit homage to Ovid's Metamorphoses - \"she feels feathers / settle on her skin\" - reminds us that the source of this coherence is in the emotional valency of each symbol. Like the great Slovenian poet Tomaz Salamun, whose work Hill's resembles, her starting point, biographically at least, was visual art. Like ...alamun she is a surrealist, using techniques of juxtaposition, interruption and symbolism to articulate narratives of the unconscious. Those narratives are the matter of universal, and universally recognisable, psychodrama. Despite Hill's recently \"outing\" herself as living with Asperger's syndrome, hers is a poetry of piercing emotional apprehension, lightly worn: \"Although she doesn't know what it is / she knows this isn't it / [. . .] Penetrative sex and housewifery / do not really interest her that much\" (\"Penetrative Sex and Housewifery\"). \"The man who burns her burns her all the time. / Why? / Because he loves her!\" (\"Turpentine\"). It's important not to be distracted by the superficial flipness. Like Stevie Smith, whose inheritor she in some ways is, Selima Hill uses apparent playfulness as a decoy. As with Smith's doodles, apparently guileless lines are in fact inky dark. It's not for nothing that A Little Book of Meat (1993) takes as its epigraph what Flannery O'Connor's mother told her about femininity: \"If you need to ask, you'll never know.\" Beside the ever-ready bodies consentingly sexualised by many of our younger women poets, Hill's explorations of femininity's conflicted backstory are sophisticated and multifaceted, their strategies strengthened by her use of book-length series of poems. Hill uses such a series in 1997's Violet to unpick the preconscious in family relationships, aware that to portray close relatives through one's own reactions to them is also to portray the self experiencing those reactions. When \"My Sister Calls Me Darling\", \"It isn't really me / she calls Darling / but another, better, sister / she's invented\". In \"Red Cows\", \"I remember the day we got married. / Very nice. / Prettiness was all I thought about. / It never entered my head to think about you. / Who were you? / Were you there? / I can't think why.\" The \"they\" of Red Roses (2006) are, as the book's dedication makes clear, \"the men I love\", who \"smoulder in hot cars / and steadfastly refuse / to be forgivable\" (\"This Is What It's Like\"). 2002's Portrait of My Lover as a Horse, with its chorus line of \"Portrait\" titles, is another book-length project. But Hill never repeats herself. Here, she uses the way lovers see the entire world through their beloved as a way to re-figure that world - with characteristic vividness: \"Portrait of my Lover as Hildegard of Bingen\" imagines \"[. . .] a constant supply / of uplifting musical instruments / shaped like intestines / made of beaten gold\". Several of these poems draw on metaphysical traditions and address the \"lover\" as \"Lord\" - a blurring of material boundaries echoed in the volume-title Gloria - and it's this sophistication which reminds us just how far her writing is from the involuntary and therapeutic, that \"repetition not reparation\" of which the psychoanalytic theorist Susan Kavaler-Adler accused women poets of the Confessional school. If Gloria's generous 330-odd pages demonstrate how substantial Hill's body of work is, The Hat shows this brilliant lyricist of human darkness writing more acutely than ever. So original that it has sometimes scared off critical scrutineers, her work must now, surely, be acknowledged as being of central importance in British poetry - not only for the courage of its subject matter but also for the lucid compression of its poetics. \u00b7 Fiona Sampson's Common Prayer (Carcanet) was short-listed for the TS Eliot prize."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
