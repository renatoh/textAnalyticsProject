The decision by the home affairs minister to rid himself of the financial interest comes amid fresh revelations about how Malcolm Turnbull threatened to use the constitutional cloud hanging over Dutton to thwart his bid to become prime minister. Following calls from Labor for the matter to be referred to the high court, Dutton said that the he had given up his interest in the RHT Family Trust before the 18 May election. The trust had a financial interest in two Brisbane childcare centres which received commonwealth subsidies, potentially putting Dutton in breach of section 44 of the constitution which prevents an MP having \u201cany direct or indirect pecuniary interest with the public service of the commonwealth\u201d. \u201cTo silence those who are politically motivated and continue to raise this; prior to the minister\u2019s nomination at the May election, he formerly renounced any interest in the trust in question,\u201d a spokeswoman for Dutton said. The minister renounced his interest in the trust despite receiving \u201cunambiguous\u201d legal advice saying he was not in breach of the controversial section, the spokeswoman said. Despite the advice, reports on Thursday morning revealed that attorney general Christian Porter and Turnbull had clashed amid last year\u2019s Liberal leadership spill over whether General Sir Peter Cosgrove could refuse to appoint Dutton because of the doubts over the home affairs minister\u2019s eligibility to sit in parliament. It was reported that Turnbull believed Cosgrove should reject Dutton on that basis but that Porter had told him that view was \u201cwrong in law\u201d. Turnbull defended his view on Twitter on Thursday afternoon: \u201cThe discretion to swear in a person as PM is vested in the Governor General. The proposition advanced by Mr Porter that it is none of the GG\u2019s business whether the would be PM is constitutionally eligible is nonsense. The GG is not a constitutional cypher.\u201d Turnbull said he had sought advice from the solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, about the constitutional cloud hanging over Dutton\u2019s eligibility, which was made public and given to MPs before they elected Scott Morrison as leader. \u201cDuring the week of 24 August 2018 there was advice from leading constitutional lawyers Bret Walker that Dutton was ineligible to sit in the Parliament and thus ineligible to be a Minister, let alone Prime Minister. I ensured we sought the advice of the Solicitor General,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cThe SG\u2019s advice was delivered on the morning of Friday 24th and duly published. His advice was that \u2018the better view\u2019 was that Dutton was eligible but it was \u2018impossible to state that position with certainty\u2019 and there was \u2018some risk\u2019 the High Court would rule he was ineligible.\u201d Turnbull\u2019s public defence comes after Porter said he believed he had given \u201caccurate and correct\u201d legal advice to the former leader in saying he could not stop the governor general from appointing Dutton. But Porter confirmed that the pair had disagreed over the matter. \u201cThe job of the attorney general is to provide advice that he or she considers is accurate and legally correct, and sometimes that advice is not always what people want to hear,\u201d Porter told the Perth radio station 6PR. \u201cBut I have always taken very seriously the role, and the fact that the role requires to give advice that to the best of your legal knowledge and ability you think is accurate and correct, and that is what I have alway tried to do, and that is what I did during the course of that very difficult week.\u201d When asked if the meeting between the pair during the final days of Turnbull\u2019s leadership had been \u201ctense\u201d, Porter said: \u201cSometimes meetings in government are not all potpourri and roses, mate, but that\u2019s life.\u201d According to the two separate reports about the confrontation, Turnbull told Porter he believed he could prevent Cosgrove from appointing Dutton as prime minister because the MP could have a financial conflict under section 44 of the constitution, owing to his wife\u2019s operation of childcare business that received a government subsidy. At the time, Turnbull raised doubts about Dutton\u2019s eligibility publicly, warning that if he were unable to sit in parliament he could not validly exercise the powers of a minister. \u201cThis is a very, very significant point,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cI cannot underline too much how important it is that anyone who seeks to be prime minister of Australia is eligible to be a member of parliament.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A professor of constitutional law at the University of Sydney, Anne Twomey, said had Turnbull consulted with Cosgrove that would not have been \u201cimproper\u201d, but she believed the outgoing leader would not have been able to give \u201cbinding\u201d formal advice about a new appointment. \u201cThe outgoing prime minister is no longer responsible to the parliament for that advice and that is why the appointment of a prime minister is regarded as a reserve power,\u201d Twomey told ABC radio."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
