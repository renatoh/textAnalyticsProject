Lin Liangren, 29, who was convicted on 21 counts of manslaughter on Friday, was told by Mr Justice Richard Henriques at Preston crown court: \"Your conduct in the lead up to the tragedy and its aftermath has been truly shocking. You cynically and callously exploited your fellow countrymen and women, provided dreadful living conditions and transported them on motorways in dangerous vehicles.\" Lin showed \"no regard\" for the safety of his workers, the judge said, forcing them to work long hours in terrible conditions. The gangmaster told \"spectacular lies\" to immigration officials and the police, Mr Justice Henriques said, and his defence contained \"unrestrained and unwarranted criticism\" of everyone from the police to the English cockle pickers who had tried to warn him of the incoming tide on the night of February 5 2004. The two remaining defendants were also sentenced yesterday. Lin Mu Yong, 31, was jailed for four years for facilitation and nine months for 10 unrelated counterfeit offences. Zhao Xiaoqing, 21, was sentenced to two years and nine months for one count of facilitation and three counts of perverting the course of justice. Earlier, Timothy Holroyde QC, for the prosecution, read out a letter from Xu Bin in China, who was orphaned when his parents died at Morecambe Bay. He said: \"Prior to the tragedy I had a lovely and warm family and even though our financial situation was not good the love from my parents made me feel warm. What now?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
