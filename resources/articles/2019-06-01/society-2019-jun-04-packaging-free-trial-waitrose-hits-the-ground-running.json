Harris, head of corporate social responsibility for Waitrose, was striding the aisles at the store in central Oxford to gauge customers\u2019 reactions to the first day of the upmarket grocer\u2019s most groundbreaking green initiative to date, aiming to reduce unnecessary packaging and single use plastics. \u201cThe idea is to find out how far our customers are prepared to shop in a completely different way and just how far they will change their behaviour,\u201d she said. The shake-up \u2013 part of an 11-week trial \u2013 starts at the store entrance, where the cellophane wrap has been removed from all flowers and indoor plants and replaced with 100% recyclable craft paper and fibre-based pots. For those who have arrived unprepared for the opportunity to ditch all conventional packaging, reusable plastic containers are for sale ranging from tiny pots to 3.6-litre food canisters. In the fresh fruit and vegetable section, packaging has been removed from 160 lines \u2013 75% of Waitrose\u2019s fresh produce offering. Dozens of lettuce heads spill over a display, like a market stall. Pak choi, mangetout and spinach are piled high. Customers can put them in compostable bags or reusable cotton bags. Soft fruits and tomatoes, which are vulnerable to damage, are contained in cardboard punnets. At the back of the store is the refill station \u2013 where customers can bring in their own containers, tubs and jars to stock up on dried goods \u2013 with a 15% saving on the packaged alternative. Containers are weighed separately and the price is then calculated and printed on a barcoded sticker for payment at the checkout. Four different wines and four beers are available on tap to take home in reusable bottles. Customers can also grind any of four coffees to take away, while a large freezer contains loose frozen fruit. Ecover washing up liquids can be bought from a refill fixture. Waitrose chose Oxford for the experiment, according to Rachel Edmonds, the company\u2019s customer proposition manager, \u201cbecause it is a large and busy store, and one where we know there is a wide range of different shopping styles \u2013 everything from a major weekly shop to popping in for the ingredients for the evening meal.\u201d Customers will be asked for feedback on the retailer\u2019s website, Twitter and Instagram and the findings will determine which of the ideas will be rolled out to other stores. Customers were curious about the changes, and having heard about the initiative on the radio or from their newspapers, had arrived with their own containers from home. Hundreds of hand-written notes had been posted on to two noticeboards that asked for suggested improvements. \u201cIt would be better if cider was on tap,\u201d read one. Pam Matthew, who lives nearby in Cumnor Hill, bought a bag of pumpkin seeds for \u00a31.55. \u201cI\u2019d normally have to buy a much bigger bag than that, when I don\u2019t need very much. I like the refill idea, but I\u2019m a little bewildered by it and it is a bit time-consuming. Until I get used to it all it\u2019s going to take me longer to do my shopping.\u201d Claudia Reed, an accountant from Poland, said she was an instant convert. \u201cIt\u2019s all very easy to use. We have refill systems back home in Poland and it makes so much sense\u201d she said, weighing her bag of frozen blueberries, which cost 50p per 100g. \u201cIt\u2019s greener and cheaper.\u201d Christine Jacques, who was shopping with her daughter Katy, said she was more sceptical. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to take a long time to get used to. It actually feels quite old-fashioned. But it\u2019s a matter of learning as you go along.\u201d The supermarket has pledged to remove black plastic \u2013 the one used for microwave meal trays \u2013 from all its own-brand products by the end of 2019, and recently launched the world\u2019s first home compostable ready meal packaging. Environmental campaigners welcomed the initiative. Daniel Webb, of the campaign group Everyday Plastic, said: \u201cOffering less packaging through refill initiatives at major supermarkets presents a massive step towards reducing the amount of plastic being thrown away. Let\u2019s cross our fingers that other supermarkets will follow.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
