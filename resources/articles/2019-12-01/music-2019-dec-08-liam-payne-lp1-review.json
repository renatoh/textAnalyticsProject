Liam Payne, One Direction\u2019s erstwhile resident safe pair of hands, seems to have settled on a curious, Unilad-sponsored approximation of Ed Sheeran (who co-writes two songs here) and Drake, eschewing his Wolverhampton roots to become Miami\u2019s least convincing playboy. On the abysmal Rude Hours, one of a handful of generic trap bops, he coos: \u201cMeet me in the parking lot... might be a bad idea I\u2019ll probably do your ass in the car\u201d, while Weekend and Both Ways, the latter about a threesome, are as boring as they are eye-rolling. There are hints at a beating heart behind the bravado on Remember and the lilting synthpop of Say It All, while 2018\u2019s OTT Rita Ora collaboration For You \u2013 chucked on to the album\u2019s second half alongside six other singles previously without a home \u2013 at least injects some drama into proceedings. But, spread over 17 songs that tick off genres with all the flair of an automated Spotify playlist, Payne\u2019s anonymity remains the album\u2019s default through line. Occasionally painful yet weirdly Payne-less."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
