The account is used for annual subscriptions, match fees, sponsorship and fundraising. A year ago the bank wrote saying that, from 1 June 2011, business tariff charges would apply to the account. I admit I did nothing immediately but, when I finally saw the charges, I appealed. I was told the fees were in line with the terms and conditions when we opened the account. MB, Kettering Your experience makes me wonder what happens when customers appeal. In this case, it seems the bank simply repeated its decision without investigating any further because, now that it has looked more closely at your account, it has discovered how it came to the wrong conclusion. Last year, Yorkshire Bank reviewed all its business accounts. In the snapshot month when it checked your usage, there was a large number of transactions. The bank concluded that you were now operating a business that was not entitled to free banking. If it had asked, you could easily have explained that this was income from fundraising which took place at that time of year, particularly from a six-a-side match for children. Yorkshire Bank has now analysed the account over the subsequent months and seen that it reverted to the normal low level of activity. It is refunding the \u00a3133 charges and restoring the account to free banking.
