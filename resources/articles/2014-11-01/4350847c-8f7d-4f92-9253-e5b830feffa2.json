Superintendent Ajith Rohana said Australia\u2019s coastguard intercepted the trawler carrying the Sri Lankans near the Indonesian coast, in the first such case in four months, before handing the asylum seekers over to Sri Lanka\u2019s navy on Thursday. \u201cThe boat left Sri Lanka on November 1,\u201d Rohana said, adding that six children were among the passengers. \u201cInvestigations are being conducted by the anti-people smuggling unit of the CID [criminal investigation department]. \u201cThey are being held in custody, but will be taken before a magistrate shortly.\u201d The Tamil Refugee Council released a statement on Saturday condemning the asylum seekers\u2019 return. \u201cUnder this illegal screening system, these people get asked only a handful of questions, have no legal help and insufficient time to explain their circumstances,\u201d said the council\u2019s spokesman Trevor Grant. \u201cIt is a system designed to ensure one outcome \u2013 that they are returned forthwith. \u201cLess than two years ago, the Australian government\u2019s own statistics showed that about 90% of boat arrivals, including those from Sri Lanka, were judged to be in need of protection. Yet suddenly, under a secret process on a boat on the high seas, with no legal oversight, only one of 38 is judged to need protection. \u201cThe idea that you can properly test a person\u2019s claim for refugee status at sea has been condemned by well-respected legal and human rights groups many times, yet this government cares nothing for its legal, moral or ethical obligations.\u201d The returns were the first since July when a boat loaded with 41 nationals was intercepted by Australia. Sri Lanka charged them with illegally leaving the country, and their cases are due to be taken up by a court next May. Australia has given two vessels to Sri Lanka\u2019s navy to patrol its shores and stop boats leaving the island, as part of Canberra\u2019s hardline border protection policy. Australia faces international censure over its treatment of boat people, who are denied resettlement in Australia and sent to camps in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific state of Nauru."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
