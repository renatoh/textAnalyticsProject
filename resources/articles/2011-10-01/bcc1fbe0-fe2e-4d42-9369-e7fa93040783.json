Their last work, Under Glass, displayed men and women in a series of glass containers, as if they were anatomical specimens; in An Anatomie In Four Quarters, the performers are placed around the auditorium of Sadler's Wells, some on show but others concealed, and waiting to be discovered as the audience walk around. It's a concept that allows the body to be seen from a variety of views, and at the same time, to explore the auditorium's space. Sadler's Wells, EC1, Sat, Sun Judith Mackrell Glasgay!, Glasgow The theatre strand of this year's Glasgay! gets into its stride this week with a number of key shows including Fish And Game's queer history lesson of cross dressing and boarding school crushes, Strange Hungers, and Martin O'Connor's Ch Ch Changes, about growing up gay in the 1970s. But the really enticing show is Liz Lochhead's Edwin Morgan's Dreams And Other Nightmares, a new piece inspired by the life of the great poet who became the first Scottish national poet \u2013 the Makar. Lochhead's piece focuses on the way that Morgan's creativity was fuelled by his gay identity, something that was initially secret but was open later in his life. Various venues, to 12 Nov, glasgay.co.uk Lyn Gardner Fanfared, Sheffield The wonderful actor Victoria Hamilton once said that the Crucible is the only stage in the country where, when you run from the back to the front, you can feel the wind in your hair. As the theatre celebrates its 40th year, it's good to see the next generation getting a foot in the door. So welcome to Invisible Flock, who will be taking audiences on an interactive journey into the Crucible's history that will include peeps into the dressing rooms, underneath the stage and possibly even leading the audience on a merry dance out on to the streets. It's not the only part of the celebrations: over the coming couple of weeks, Sheffield heroes Forced Entertainment will be presenting Tim Etchells's brilliant That Night Follows Day, with a cast of 16 local young people, and Richard Hurford has written a big show for all the family called Lives In Art. Crucible, Tue to 12 Nov Lyn Gardner Collaborators, London It's Moscow in 1938 and the murderous Stalin is about to celebrate his 60th birthday. Someone has to write a play to celebrate the occasion, and in John Hodge's imagination, the poisoned chalice/short straw is handed to writer Mikhail Bulgakov (The White Guard, The Master and Magarita). Hodge's play is inspired by real events but takes off on a surreal odyssey into the mind of the writer and an encounter between him and the dictator. The two had a complex relationship over the years, Stalin initially favouring the writer but later restricting his career. Alex Jennings plays Bulgakov and Simon Russell Beale Stalin in a play that looks at the artist's role in a particularly perilous time and place. Nicholas Hytner directs. Cottesloe, SE1, to 21 Jan Mark Cook Captain Corelli's Mandolin, Colchester Louis de Berni\u00e8res will be at the Mercury in Colchester today to discuss his bestseller, which has been adapted for the stage. It forms the centrepiece of the Mercury's festival exploring collaboration across borders before touring nationally and internationally next year. Set on the Greek island of Cephalonia during the second world war as Mussolini's army advances, Berni\u00e8res's unlikely love story has attracted the attention of the Kote Marjanishvili Theatre from Tbilisi who premiered the show in Georgia earlier this year to considerable acclaim. Three British actors join the cast that includes Mike Maran, who first adapted the book for the stage in 1999, leading Georgian actor Natuka Kakhidze and 10 puppets. Stage adaptations of well-loved novels can be tricky, but this sounds as if it has a good chance of getting it right. Mercury Theatre, to 12 Nov Lyn Gardner Three Days In May, London Warren Clarke is a familiar craggily rumpled face on our TV screens, but he hasn't appeared on stage for more than a decade. Now he returns in a role which he was surely meant to play: Winston Churchill. Three Days In May, by Ben Brown, is for the most part a fly-on-the-wall drama set in 10 Downing Street in 1940, just after Churchil has become prime minister in the wake of Neville Chamberlain's resignation. Brown explores how the War Cabinet came to the epoch-changing decision of fighting on against Hitler rather than following a French proposal of entering into a peace treaty. Clarke gets his chance to do the big Churchill oration in the speech delivering the final decision to the House of Commons. Trafalgar Studios, SW1, Mon to 3 Mar Mark Cook Audience, Plymouth Renewing their association with Flemish theatrical pranksters Ontroerend Goed, The Drum gives Plymouth audiences a chance to experience one of the most talked about productions from Edinburgh this summer. As the title suggests, it's the audience that comes under scrutiny in a show that combines shameless manipulation with some fascinating questions into how groups behave, whether people join in, act against or just decide to watch. It caused some outrage in Edinburgh for its treatment of a young woman \u2013 a stooge in most Edinburgh performances \u2013 but more interesting is its celebration in the opening camera shots of the audience as individuals and in the company's continued quest to push the boundaries of theatre. Drum, Wed to 12 Nov Lyn Gardner balletLORENT, on tour Liv Lorent's company is currently touring two very different works this month. La Nuit Intime recreates the sweat, glitter and pheromone-driven encounters of the world of the nightclub. The audience are free to move around the space, chat to their friends, even order a drink at the bar as a DJ plays underground, contemporary classics and rare tracks and dancers perform pole-dancing, flamenco or disco routines. By contrast, Under The Floor \u2013 which next pops up in Bournemouth on 30 Nov \u2013 is an interactive work for under fives, telling a tale of a magical world beneath the floorboards.
