Or savage mass murderers reaping death and ill feeling across a neighbourhood near you? Where do you stand, in other words, on the issue of cats? Before we begin to dissect this dilemma, I should be open and declare my interests. I have never owned a cat and if I ever had to make such an inane declaration under, say, the threat of thumbscrews it would be that I am a \"dog person\". But please do not think that this has influenced in any way what I am about to say. There's no getting away from it: cats are killers. It may be their instincts at work, but according to the Mammal Society, Britain's 8m domesticated cats (and 1m feral cats) kill up to 300m wild birds and mammals every year. That is about 35 animals every year or one every 10 days, per cat. With much of our native wildlife already under extreme pressure from urban sprawl, agrochemicals, traffic and climate change, small birds don't need to be worrying about moggies lurking in the undergrowth. When you consider the cat density in some urban areas - one study in Bristol found 226 cats per square kilometre - it is surprising that there is any prey left for them to chase. Little wonder that, in another Mammal Society survey (you get the feeling that this group are not exactly cat people despite the apparently inclusive name), cats came second only to rats as the least popular visiting mammal to our gardens. Even a fox is twice as welcome as a cat, according to the findings. So should we order the great British cat cull? While there is certainly much sense in better managing the number of cats through increased neutering, there is much that owners can do to counter their pet's predatory instincts. The Feline Advisory Bureau and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, not obvious bedfellows, have united in endorsing quick-release cat collars mounted with bells as one of the best ways of reducing wildlife kill rates. In tests, cats wearing these collars killed 41% fewer birds and 34% fewer mammals than those with a plain collar. Collars with electronic sonic devices achieved even better results. The RSPB also recommends that garden bird-feeders are placed more than two metres away from dense vegetation and that nesting boxes are located well out of reach of any cats. It also stresses that gardens are becoming increasingly important providers of food and shelter for some of our most endangered native species such as the house sparrow, starling and song thrush. The Mammal Society's study of species preyed on by cats shows that the most commonly killed birds are, in order, house sparrows, blue tits, blackbirds, starlings and robins. There is more cat-owners can do to help. Open-all-hours cat flaps allow a cat to be outside when birds are at their most vulnerable. Birds are most active an hour after sunrise and an hour before sunset, which makes these periods the best times to feed and, therefore, to keep cats indoors. There is, of course, a counter argument to all this: that no animal's instincts should be suppressed. They, like the birds, the frogs and the mice they catch, are all just doing what comes naturally. It could also be argued that cats tend to pick off the weak, thereby aiding natural selection. But except for a species of wild cat in Scotland, cats are not native to these shores and their introduction has caused a disproportionate burden on our already pressured native wildlife. The onus on all owners is surely to reduce the negative impact of their cat's natural calling wherever possible. You say ... Erica Wildwood, Ipswich Cats have a social life entirely separate from humans and you should respect their autonomy. You must also accept the fact that they are predators. It is not OK to keep a cat indoors and to declaw it. Treat a cat well and it will reward you with lots of loving headbutts and purrs.
