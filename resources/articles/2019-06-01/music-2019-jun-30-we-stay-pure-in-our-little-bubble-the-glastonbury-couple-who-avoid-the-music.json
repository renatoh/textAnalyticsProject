In that time, we have seen one act. It was Leonard Cohen, Sunday night on the Pyramid stage, the sun had just dropped \u2013 it was one of those perfect moments. It was 2008 and it is still a vivid memory. It took someone like Leonard Cohen to make us trek all that way. Nobody else has pulled us since. No one has remotely come close. We\u2019ve had a spot in the Healing Field for years. We hear tales from the rest of the festival, that other world. People our end call it Babylon. As far as we\u2019re concerned, we\u2019re at the best part of the festival, so why would we go to Babylon? We\u2019ve heard about people going down there and getting corrupted. We just stay pure in our little bubble. I have a sense of coming home when I go to Glastonbury. Call me a hippie. Music is an essential part of the festival, but it has so many unique things about it. There is this Green Fields vibe \u2013 the crafty bit, the healing bit \u2013 then there is the more commercial, young-people stuff. The way those two aspects of the festival support each other is wonderful. When we first turned up, we had a gong and a tent. We thought: \u201cWe\u2019ll do something; we\u2019re not sure what.\u201d This has evolved into what is now a polished routine: you lie on the mats, we bang the gong and you are bathed in sound. It can be meditative. The easiest way to pitch it would be a relaxing session, but that would be an oversimplification. Some people find a gong bath energising. They drop down into deeper states of consciousness. If people have grief or trauma, that can be triggered to release. It can be a profound experience. But we never say: \u201cCome have a gong bath session, it\u2019s going to do this,\u201d because it is all potentials. We\u2019re very popular. We sell out of sessions very quickly. You might think that it would be hard to access that deeper consciousness with the sound of the festival, but we lead people into it quite artfully \u2013 even if I say so myself. We say that it is just the symphony of life. I heard Kylie Minogue is playing on Sunday [She is on at 3.45pm, in the \u201clegend\u201d slot.] Would I go down for Kylie? Na \u2013 she can come up, if she wants to see us."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
