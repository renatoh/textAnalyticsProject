Southgate did not think he had been misquoted but his verdict on Smalling\u2019s ability was always going to generate headlines and, a week on, it was clear he wished it had turned out differently. Smalling, he said, was entitled to be \u201cupset and disappointed\u201d by the publicity it created. \u201cIf I had been Chris, I would have gone: \u2018That\u2019s a bit unfair.\u2019\u201d Unfortunately for Smalling, the basic point remains the same. Southgate wants his team to build from the back and Smalling, however it is dressed up, is not exactly Beckenbauer-esque in his distribution. Yes, it could have been explained with a little more tact but if there is one thing we should know about Southgate from his 14 months in charge it is how ridiculous it was for anyone to assume he might be afraid \u2013 too nice, according to the popular theory \u2013 to make difficult decisions. Smalling certainly cannot be the only one who feels slightly wounded this week now Southgate is planning to call up Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Demarai Gray and Dominic Solanke for the Brazil game on Tuesday, once they have played for the under-21s in Ukraine on Friday, and has kept out Daniel Sturridge, Jermain Defoe and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain even after the withdrawal of six players. It is easy to see what is in Southgate\u2019s thoughts given the way Germany, England\u2019s opponents at Wembley on Friday, have successfully integrated younger players. Southgate is a huge admirer of that system, especially when his last job was as manager of England\u2019s under-21s, and that helps to explain why Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Tammy Abraham and Jordan Pickford go straight into his team to face the world champions. \u201cIf we don\u2019t try things now, when will we?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just about Russia [next summer\u2019s World Cup], it\u2019s beyond that. Germany took a young team to the Confederations Cup. They are brave enough to take decisions which might get them results or might not. They are constantly evolving and that\u2019s what we have to do.\u201d At the same time, England will have only four friendlies beyond the current international break before they play their first game of the World Cup and the time is surely approaching when Southgate ought to have a set team, with players who know each other\u2019s games and are accustomed to working in the same system. Perhaps that will be easier when the six Spurs players \u2013 now down to three because of the injury problems for Harry Kane, Dele Alli and Harry Winks \u2013 are all available whereas the only real theme for now is that Southgate is planning to operate with a three-man defence, using quick, attack-minded wing-backs, and hoping one or two of his younger players seize the initiative in the way Marcus Rashford did before Euro 2016. That is not going to be easy for Loftus-Cheek bearing in mind he is playing for a Crystal Palace side rooted at the bottom of the Premier League. Yet the England midfield is clearly an issue and Danny Drinkwater\u2019s reluctance to join up, after a personal call from the manager, has left a place available beside Jake Livermore of West Bromwich Albion. Officially, Drinkwater does not feel fit enough to represent England after starting one game for Chelsea, with a further three substitute appearances, since returning from injury in late October. Yet it has also been rumoured for some time that he has not embraced international football and, though he has not put it in those terms to Southgate, it never looks good when a player who is fit, even if it not fully so, says no. Southgate was asked whether he would have done the same in his own playing career and expertly swerved the question. The truth, as everyone in his company knew, was that he would never have dreamt of turning down England. Instead, that opportunity falls to Loftus-Cheek, a creative 20-year-old with a deceptive touch bearing in mind he has the physique of a rugby player. \u201cHe\u2019s always been the biggest kid in the playground but he\u2019s not a player who has survived on physical strength,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cHe\u2019s a different sort of player, at his best in behind the opposition midfield, driving at defences \u2013 great technical quality, dribbling ability, power. He\u2019s a really exciting player. He\u2019s quite a quiet lad so I\u2019m hoping he gets a lift in confidence from how we see him.\u201d What that does for Jack Wilshere\u2019s confidence is another matter at a time when Southgate says he intends to speak to the Arsenal player in the coming weeks but does not appear to have anything particularly positive to say. Southgate said last week that he could not trust Wilshere because of the player\u2019s recurring injury issues but in his latest press conference he also brought in the team\u2019s tactics and, specifically, that Wilshere has been operating as a No10 in his sporadic appearances for Arsenal and previously on loan at Bournemouth. \u201cI think he is a deeper player,\u201d Southgate said, \u201cbut he is not playing deeper.\u201d Everything put together, it sounded very much like Wilshere was a long way from being called back. Slowly but surely, the Roy Hodgson team is being replaced by a new-look version, now with Abraham at the spearhead of the team\u2019s attack, but Southgate insisted that Joe Hart was still his undisputed No1. Jack Butland has been in the thoughts of England\u2019s management and his latest injury, breaking a finger, is another serious misfortune for the Stoke City goalkeeper, leaving the way open for Pickford to stake his own claims. The tricky bit for Southgate would usually be making these changes while taking into account that England are facing the two sides at the top of Fifa\u2019s world rankings but the dangers are reduced by Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s comments that he will be doing roughly the same with Germany. Southgate has been undermined on that front by the absence of so many key players but there was no sense of him being suspicious about any of the cry-offs and, in keeping with a long line of England managers, he used the moment to call for new discussions about the possibility of a winter break. \u201cThe reality is that it is not something that is going to happen in the next couple of years,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
