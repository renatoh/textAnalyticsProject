She expected her venture, Afrori Books, to be a side-hustle at most but interest in black writers skyrocketed as a result of the Black Lives Matter protests, and business is booming. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown massively,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have quite a lot of returning customers, so we\u2019re getting something right. My little side-hustle is actually now about 10 hours a day.\u201d Jacaranda, a publisher and bookseller that specialises in promoting diverse writers, also saw an increase in sales after the BLM protests. \u201cIt\u2019s so bittersweet; on the one hand it\u2019s good that people are paying attention and are learning and they want to educate themselves,\u201d said sales manager Jazzmine Breary. \u201cOur only hope is that it continues, it should not take the death and suffering of black people for it to happen. Let it continue. Let it not be the only moment.\u201d Bernardine Evaristo and Reni Eddo-Lodge became the first black British women to top the UK\u2019s fiction and nonfiction paperback charts in June on the back of soaring book sales, with Eddo-Lodge describing it \u201ca horrible indictment of the publishing industry\u201d that it had taken so long. The veteran bookseller New Beacon Books in north London, the UK\u2019s first black publisher and specialist bookshop, has also benefited from the surging demand for black literature. It has lived through dozens of mass movements, but the events of this year have sparked something different, according to its director, Michael La Rose. \u201cThe consciousness-raising of the global BLM movement has made every country question what is going on in their societies \u2013 people want to know what has happened in the past, to get books, to get information, to get facts,\u201d said La Rose, the son of John La Rose, who founded the business with his partner, Sarah White, in 1966. \u201cThat led to more business on our website and people walking into the bookshop.\u201d Like most retailers, the bookshop has taken a hit this year because of lockdown, and La Rose said a \u201csustained movement\u201d was needed to ensure the longevity of specialist black bookshops in the future. Initiatives such as black pound day, in which consumers are encouraged to shop at black-owned businesses once a month, have helped the retailer in the face of online competition from Amazon, he said, but momentum needs to be maintained. Renewed focus on the lack of diversity in publishing and literature has prompted new initiatives, such as Penguin\u2019s recently announced project to boost diversity in GCSE reading lists, and the newly formed Black Writers\u2019 Guild has been pushing for action from the big publishing houses. But bookshop owners say there\u2019s a long way to go before the publishing industry and mainstream bookshops fully reflect the diversity of black talent in the UK. \u201cIn the long term, my aim and my hope is that we will stop being a bookshop that stocks black authors and just be a bookshop, because we won\u2019t need to be highlighting this stuff, but we\u2019re a long, long way from that,\u201d said Bain. \u201cBut what we\u2019re doing is actually changing the world, because if you read a book by a black author, it changes the way you see things, it changes the way you see black people. And that can only be positive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
