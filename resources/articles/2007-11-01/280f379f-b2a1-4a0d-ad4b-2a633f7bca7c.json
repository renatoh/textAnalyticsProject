The bankers have stopped buying van Goghs", "bodyText": "You can tell how bad things are getting when van Gogh's last landscape, The Wheat Fields, expected to fetch in excess of \u00a316.7m, received no bids at last week's Sotheby's auction of Impressionists in New York. This is despite the fact that New York is humming with chief executives whose reward for presiding over billions of dollars worth of losses has been 'retirement packages' running to tens, even hundreds, of millions of dollars. If I had known that Chuck Prince of Citigroup and Stan O'Neal of Merrill Lynch were not in the running, I might been tempted to put in a bid for The Wheat Fields myself. The panic in the financial markets is difficult to keep up with. On one newspaper page alone last week there were three disturbing headlines: 'Morgan Stanley sounds warning of $6bn write-off'; '[Northern] Rock's deposits drained by \u00a310.5 bn'; and 'Sarkozy warns of \"economic war\" as dollar slides to 26-year low'. For good measure, the International Herald Tribune complained of 'an unprecedented public badmouthing' by the Chinese government of the US dollar, under the banner headline 'Stocks tumble as dollar loses status as a haven', accompanied by a comment from Goldman Sachs's chief European economist that read: 'We are experiencing among our clients an awakening that the United States is in big trouble. It is not just the mortgage market.' Oh, I nearly forgot: the other big news is that the price of oil, at around $100 a barrel, is close (after allowing for inflation) to the level reached during the oil shocks of the 1970s. Depending on your standpoint, this is either good news (if the price mechanism is going to force serious consideration of the implications of global warming) or bad news, in the short term, for industrial economies (because the high price will affect our ability to purchase commodities and goods other than oil, while possibly, because of its inflationary implications, also deterring central banks from lowering interest rates in the face of a credit crunch that is also going to affect output and lead to higher unemployment - not least in the City of London. Are you still with me?). But, again, the soaring oil price may just possibly make President Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney think twice about extending their war in Iraq over the border to Iran - a move that would cause such mayhem as to propel the oil price even nearer to the sky (where, we are told from childhood, every cloud has a silver lining). And, with the banks drawing in their horns, and the price of oil also about to hit the real economy, we also have the impact of the weak dollar on the competitiveness of both the UK and the eurozone, via the corresponding strength of the pound and the euro. Which brings us back to President Sarkozy. You have got to hand it to him; he was not a finance minister for nothing. His broadly pro-American stance may have brought him a standing ovation from both Houses of Congress last week, but he did not mince words about anarchy in foreign exchange markets. Way back in the 1970s, US Treasury Secretary John Connally told Europe that the (then) declining dollar was 'our currency but your problem'. Sarkozy wants 'fair exchange rates' - in which case he will also have to try his luck on the Chinese, whose beggar-my-neighbour policy means that Europe (including the UK) is taking the strain. Mention of strain brings us to a little local difficulty. My personal straw poll has established that most people last week thought the Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, had decided - reappointment be blowed - that he was going to stand up for the Bank and blame the Treasury for not having rescued Northern Rock. This interpretation is not surprising, since that was the way it came across on the BBC's File on Four interview and in newspaper headlines such as 'Darling \"vetoed\" secret move to save Northern Rock'. But in fact, what King actually said in the interview was: 'I don't think it took the Chancellor very long to recognise that not only was this something which central banks don't do, it's also something that governments don't do.' If this was a complaint that the Chancellor had vetoed a rescue plan of the governor's, then my name is Nicolas Sarkozy. Nevertheless, the sound of the members of the failed 'tripartite' approach to banking supervision protecting their backs has been deafening. The Treasury comes badly out of the Northern Rock affair. The Bank of England comes badly out of it. And so does the 'hands off' Financial Services Authority. One should note Mervyn King's remarkable admission that 'we' (variously interpreted to mean either 'the Bank' or 'all three institutions') should have injected 'some urgency into the need for new legislation to enable there to be a procedure for pre-emptive intervention in banks and the reform of deposit insurance'. They had plenty of time, but banking supervision and financial stability are boring until they become interesting - and by then it is too late, especially if experience and resources are lacking. Nevertheless, Dr Sushil Wadhwani, a former member of the Monetary Policy Committee, believes the fiasco might have been averted if the Bank had been quicker to provide 'term liquidity' to the markets in August. And Sir Brian Unwin, head of the Treasury's banking division at the time of the secondary banking crisis of the 1970s, describes the Northern Rock affair as 'a complete mess', adding 'it is difficult to see how it can be resolved... without huge cost to the public purse.' So much for moral hazard..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
