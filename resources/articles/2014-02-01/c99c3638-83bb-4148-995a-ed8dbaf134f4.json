La Chiva Gantiva was started by three percussion-playing Colombian students in the city, who got together with two Belgian musicians, plus one from France and another from Vietnam, to create their own high-energy Latin fusion. There are Colombian influences here, of course, particularly in the furious percussion work that drives on almost every song. But then there's jangling funk in the opening Para Arriba, wailing clarinet and brass on Me Voy De Mi Cabeza, Spanish rap and guitar riffs added to the mix for El Pollo, the story of a lazy adolescent, and echoes of Manu Chao in the one French song, Pigeon. This is frantic, good-time music that I suspect will sound even better live."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
