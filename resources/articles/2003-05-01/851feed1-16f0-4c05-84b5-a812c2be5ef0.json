In my suitcase I had a copy of The English Teacher. From the pink cover of the University of Chicago Press edition the drawing of a desolate dark-haired man, chin resting in his palms, stared up at me with sorrowful eyes. I was 23 years old and choosing an unusual profession for an Indian of my generation and background. Although I had read The Tiger of Malgudi and knew something of RK Narayan's reputation from the glowing Graham Greene blurbs on the backs of his books, he was neither taught nor mentioned at my public school in India where we studied the great works of English Literature: Julius Caesar, Tintern Abbey, Far From The Madding Crowd and The Hobbit. At Cambridge, where I studied for my BA, it was Rushdie and Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez who were all the rage. On cold autumn evenings, after energetic days of learning the ropes at the Institute of Education, I lay down in my train-rattled Queen's Park bedroom full of expectation that this English teacher of Narayan's novel would be a deep-thinking fellow with piercing insights into literature and life, and would perhaps even buoy me up from the chaos and fear I was experiencing in the face of an unfamiliar mob at the Brent comprehensive where I was preparing to teach. To tell the truth, I was not impressed by what I read. Narayan's quiet, plain style, with its comic depictions of old-fashioned college hostels and small-town railway stations, was too far away from my immediate concerns. On the first page, Krishnan, the teacher-protagonist, assesses his life thus: \"I got up at eight every day, read for the 50th time Milton, Carlyle and Shakespeare, looked through compositions, swallowed a meal, dressed, and rushed out of the hostel just when the second bell sounded at college; four hours later I returned to my room; my duty in the middle had been admonishing, cajoling and browbeating a few hundred boys of Albert Mission College so they might mug up Shakespeare and Milton and secure high marks and save me adverse remarks from my chiefs at the end of the year... I was a poet, and I was constantly nagged by the feeling that I was doing the wrong work.\" While I trekked through the fallen leaves and swirling winds of Euston to hear lectures on the theory of language, featuring Vygotsky and Bakhtin, and attended seminars on anti-racism, I was reading about the poet manqu\u00e9 waking up at five in the morning, going for long walks, and bathing in the river in the imaginary town of Malgudi where Narayan sets his novels. Very soon, Krishnan moves out of his hostel and his wife and little child arrive by train to make a home in the town. \"I made a mental note,\" the nervous father tells us while pacing agitatedly to and fro on the platform, \"Must shout as soon as the train stops: 'be careful with the baby.' This seemed to my fevered imagination the all-important thing to say on arrival, as otherwise I fancied the child's head was sure to be banged against the doorway...\" At the same time as I read about the husband, wife and daughter settling into their rented bungalow, my \"fevered imagination\" in London was rife with the repeated insults and humiliations heaped upon me by students whose attention I was trying to secure with hopelessly inadequate lesson plans. The domestic bliss of Krishnan and his wife is spoiled by nothing more than the occasional spat about the shopping list he dares to alter, or the rickety alarm clock - whose shrieking is only silenced \"by placing a heavy book like Taine's History of English Literature on its crest\" - she decides to sell to \"a man who comes to buy old things\". Then, all of a sudden, family happiness is interrupted. The teacher's wife has contracted typhoid. Narayan describes her bedridden emaciation, the vagaries of Indian doctors, Krishnan's devotion and the painstaking nursing of his wife with the same light touch he uses for Krishnan's miseries at the college. He shows us how trauma, sorrow and death can be conveyed without histrionic gesture or pyrotechnics of style. This way of describing the world creates a unique poignancy and beauty, but in my teacher-training days I was too young or too preoccupied to appreciate it. Perhaps I should have been reading Thomas Mann to suit the weight of my mood. I became even more disaffected when less than halfway through the book Sushila dies and Krishnan, in an unusual and brave step, takes over the looking-after of his daughter. Some time later he is contacted by someone who describes himself as a medium through whom he can speak to his dead wife. Much of the rest of the book is taken up with Krishnan's visits to the medium, who writes down the messages sent to Krishnan from his wife, and his efforts thereafter to communicate directly with her; a life-long conversation Narayan is said to have confessed to having with his own dead wife. I can't remember now if I finished the book but my western materialist leanings couldn't be doing with mediums and stories of talking to the dead. Years later, browsing my shelves, I came across The English Teacher again. I was struggling to find a voice for my second novel and the few paragraphs I read were of such beguiling simplicity and clarity that I resolved to make time for a second reading. Revisiting it at the age of 40 I find in it so many beautiful and moving things. I recognise and sympathise with the way Krishnan describes the psychological pain of everyday life, the simple, short-lived epiphanies that light us along our way. \"Why had I become incapable of controlling my own thoughts? I brooded over it. Needless to say it took me nowhere. I felt a great regret at having spent a fine evening in brooding and self-analysis, and then reached a startlingly simple solution.\" In Narayan's hands even the torture of the mind is so untortured; the conversations and descriptions so unadorned as to give the impression of words flowing like blood or air through one's body. To anyone who is a parent the detail of this exchange between motherless daughter and widowed father must touch a special chord. \"'Oh, father has woken up!' she cried happily. I looked at her with suspicion and asked: 'What have you been trying to do so close to me?' 'I only wanted to watch, that is all. I didn't wake you up.' 'Watch what?' 'I wanted to watch if any ant or fly was going to get into you through your nose, that is all...' 'Did any get in?' 'No. Because I was watching... what do you do when you sleep, father?' \" The loss of a mother and of a young wife is sparingly and heartrendingly told. As the flames appear over the wall where Sushila is being cremated, Narayan gives powerful voice to Krishnan's feelings. \"There are no more surprises and shocks in life, so that I watch the flame without agitation. For me the greatest reality is this and nothing else... Nothing else will worry or interest me in life hereafter.\" As I am now married and have two daughters under the age of 10 these are painful words to imagine in a way they weren't before. And as a writer who has struggled with the artifice of words, and who both hates and loves it, I am more aware of the miracle of Narayan's style. He makes it look easy. \u00b7 Ardashir Vakil's latest book, One Day, is published by Hamish Hamilton, price \u00a312.99.
