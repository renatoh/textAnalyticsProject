There he would be, relaxing in front of Match of the Day, while methodically folding his charcoal cashmere jumpers and starching his blue shirts. But explaining why he chose to live in a hotel while manager of Manchester United, he revealed himself as lacking in the domestic department: \u201cI would have to iron, I don\u2019t know how to.\u201d None of us do, do we? Lynsey Crombie, AKA Queen of Clean, answers some pressing questions. How do you iron shirts? Always start with the collar: start in the middle and work your way out because if you iron straight across it, you can get lumps and bumps in it. I don\u2019t use starch. These days you don\u2019t need to, as lots of shirts have collar stiffeners in them. Next, do the yoke \u2013 the part across the upper back and shoulder \u2013 then the sleeves, cuffs and main body. As soon as you\u2019ve ironed it, get it on a hanger and hang it up with space around it. What about iron fitted sheets? I iron fitted sheets so they fit neatly into the cupboard. If you don\u2019t iron them, you tend to screw them up and shove them in. The trick here is to fold the sheet in half, then into a quarter. I don\u2019t bother to iron the elasticated bits separately; I fold it up, so the sheet becomes square-shaped, then iron it. Should you use linen spray? I don\u2019t, but if I\u2019m away without an iron, I make a spray from white wine vinegar diluted with warm water. Spray the garment, then pull it to get the creases out. When do you change the setting on your iron? I separate my ironing pile. I do my delicates first on the lowest setting, then work my way up to the items that need the hottest setting. Which fabrics should you not iron? I iron everything. Silk is the only one you need to be careful with; I put a tea towel on top to prevent damage. Be careful with lace or a netted feature on garments; iron those inside out or put a slightly damp cloth over the top. You might not have to iron it anyway. Should you iron handkerchiefs and tea towels? It\u2019s personal preference. I think an ironed handkerchief looks nicer. I do iron tea towels sometimes, because then they fit in the drawer nicely. How about a pleated skirt? I do. Put it on your ironing board and rotate it, pressing each pleat once. And pants? No. I used to run an ironing business and people would give me their pants to iron, and it was disgusting. But it\u2019s a personal choice. If you want hot, steamy pants, iron them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
