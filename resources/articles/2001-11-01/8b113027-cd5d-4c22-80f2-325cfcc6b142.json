The first change to England's tour schedule has been made because the Bombay Gymkhana ground has no perimeter fencing. Even though refurbishments are unlikely to be completed at the Wankhede before the two-day match against the Mumbai Cricket Association on November 18 and 19, the hosts have decided it is safer in the current political climate to make the switch. Some of England's players were reluctant to travel to India because of the ramifications of the war against terrorism but, with the tour given the go-ahead by organisers and players two weeks ago after a security fact-finding visit to India by English cricket representatives, the hosts are clearly taking steps to ensure safety. The MCA joint secretary Mayank Khandwala said: \"We have been asked to host the match at the Wankhede stadium for security reasons. \"It is a late development. There is some repair work going on in the West Stand, so the Wankhede stadium may not be in the shape we want it to be for a tour match.\" An England and Wales Cricket Board spokesman Mark Hodgson gave his employer's backing to the change of plan, adding: \"The security of the players has always been the ECB's No1 priority on this tour.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
