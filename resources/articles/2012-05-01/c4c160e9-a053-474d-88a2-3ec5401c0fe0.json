Global Radio's Capital had 2.27 million listeners each week on average in the first quarter of 2012 \u2013 its biggest audience for eight years \u2013 and a 5.3% share of the London audience, according to the latest official Rajar figures published on Thursday. Bauer Radio's Magic came second in terms of weekly reach, down nearly 10% on the quarter to just more than 1.96 million, but claimed back No 1 spot in market share with 6.1% because its listeners tuned in for longer. Capital, where Dave Berry replaced Johnny Vaughan on breakfast alongside Lisa Snowdon in January, remained top dog in the breakfast wars with 1.26 million listeners, ahead of Magic 105.4's Neil Fox, with 793,000, and Heart's Jamie Theakston and Harriet Scott (759,000). Global Radio sister station Heart London, which was down 8% year on year to 1.94 million, was leapfrogged by another Bauer station, Kiss 100, which was up 7.5% on last year to just under 1.96 million. Kiss also had the advantage in audience share, with 5.1% against Heart's 4.4%. Heart's share of the audience also lagged behind sister station LBC 97.3, with the talk station gaining 4.6% of the London market despite its audience dropping 10% on the previous quarter to 867,000. Global's Xfm London lost nearly a third of its audience in the capital, down 32.3% year on year (but up 0.7% on the quarter) to 409,000. Better news at another Global station, Choice FM, which was up 36.4% on 2011 to 577,000. Elsewhere in London, GMG Radio's Smooth Radio London had 626,000 listeners, up 37.3% on the previous quarter but down 2.6% year on year.
