But now Forest Green\u2019s plans for an even more eco-friendly future have come unstuck, thanks to that most familiar of reactionary forces \u2013 the local parish council. Plans for a new 5,000-seat stadium, made entirely from wood, have been rejected at the last moment after concerns were raised this week by Eastington Parish Council. Now the club, which finished in the League Two play-off positions this year but were knocked out by Tranmere, will have to decide whether to appeal against the decision with the Forest Green chairman, Dale Vince, calling the outcome \u201ca poor show\u201d. Vince told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: \u201cI am a little bit disappointed about what happened. It is a poor show. Four years of work have gone into this, and the council has spent a lot of time and money doing this job properly. \u201cIt was properly assessed, recommended for approval. They are on weak ground and maybe we will appeal but that is another year of my life. The fans will be disappointed and devastated. If you go around the district of Stroud there will be a lot of people disappointed.\u201d The stadium project had originally been recommended by Stroud District Council but Eastington Parish Council, covering the area surrounding junction 13 of the M5 and the site of the proposed ground, raised several objections at a meeting on 10 June, including complaints about possible noise from the ground and landscaping which would \u201cdetract from the visual appearance of the access to Stroud\u201d. In a final meeting of Stroud District Council on Wednesday night, a motion to approve the stadium was rejected, and a motion to reject the stadium approved. \u201cI think it is stunning but we need to balance the benefits of that development against the potential costs,\u201d said one councillor, Hayden Jones. \u201cOn balance I thought it had greater costs than benefits to the local community and road network.\u201d The planned Eco Park stadium had been designed by Zaha Hadid Architects and promised a state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art construction \u201ccombining the latest material research and construction techniques with new design approaches to build a more ecologically sustainable and inclusive architecture\u201d. The wooden structure would have been the first of its kind and was chosen by Vince in part for its low carbon footprint. \u201cThe importance of wood is not only that it\u2019s naturally occurring, it has very low embodied carbon \u2013 about as low as it gets for a building material,\u201d he said when the designs were announced."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
