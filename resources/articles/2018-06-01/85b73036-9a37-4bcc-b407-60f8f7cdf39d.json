The data is entirely ineffective.\u201d Kogan\u2019s appearance before the Senate comes three months after the revelation that he had transferred his giant dataset to Cambridge Analytica, a now defunct political consultancy that worked on Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. The scandal set off political shockwaves in the US and UK. The academic was portrayed as a liar and a fraud by Facebook when news of the data harvest broke in March. Kogan has argued in the press and before parliament that he was being scapegoated for behavior that was normal and that Facebook did nothing to prevent. At the hearing on Tuesday, Kogan repeatedly took aim at the field of research \u2013 psychometrics \u2013 that Cambridge Analytica claimed it could use to predict voters\u2019 psychological traits and influence their votes. \u201cIf the goal of Cambridge Analtyica was to show personalized advertisements on Facebook, then what they did was stupid,\u201d Kogan said, arguing that it is much more effective for any advertiser to use Facebook\u2019s own advertising targeting tools. Kogan\u2019s dismissal of psychometrics\u2019 predictive value is certain to irk his former colleagues at Cambridge University\u2019s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers with the renowned program published a widely cited study showing that Facebook likes could be used to predict a wide array of personality traits. Whether the ability to predict certain traits can be translated into psychologically tailored advertisements is very much open to debate, however, and Kogan is by no means alone in questioning the efficacy of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s targeting practices. The researcher, who studied prosociality and wellbeing before leaving academia to pursue commercial opportunities, also lobbed criticisms at Facebook for its addictive nature. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that Facebook is in the business of trying to keep you on Facebook as long as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe model does run counter not only to our privacy but to our wellbeing.\u201d Though Facebook has instituted a number of reforms to its privacy practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analtyica scandal, Tuesday\u2019s hearing was a sign that for some US lawmakers at least, there remains an appetite to regulate internet platforms. \u201cAmericans deserve no less privacy than Europeans,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, during his opening remarks, in reference to the EU\u2019s new data privacy protections. Also appearing before the subcommittee were John Battelle and Ashkan Soltani. Batelle, a veteran media entrepreneur who is chairman of an ad tech company and serves on the board of directors of data brokerage Acxiom, said Facebook was incapable of addressing \u201cthe externalities it has created\u201d. He argued for a light touch on regulation, however, saying; \u201cThe wrong conclusion to draw from Cambridge Analytica is that entities like Facebook must build higher walls around their data.\u201d Soltani, an independent privacy researcher who served as chief technologist for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) during the Obama administration, said that he believed Facebook had violated its 2011 consent decree with the FTC and that there was a \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d the body would impose fines against the company. \u201cI have no doubt that Facebook has violated its consent decree,\u201d said Blumenthal. \u201cThe only question now is what should be done about it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
