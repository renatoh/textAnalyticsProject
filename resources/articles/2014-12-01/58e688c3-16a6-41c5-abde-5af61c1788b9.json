Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Representative Stephen Fincher of Tennessee, wrote in a post that Malia, 16, and Sasha, 13, should have shown more \u201cclass\u201d at Wednesday\u2019s annual White House turkey pardoning ceremony. \u201cAct like being in the White House matters to you,\u201d Lauten wrote. \u201cDress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. And certainly don\u2019t make faces during televised public events.\u201d Lauten also took a swing at Malia and Sasha\u2019s parents: \u201cThen again your mother and father don\u2019t respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter, so I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re coming up a little short in the \u2018good role model\u2019 department.\u201d Lauten deleted the post, but not before screen grabs had been taken and shared across social media. The post went viral, with critics suggesting the GOP staffer had gone too far. Some called for her resignation. Hours later, she posted an apology. \u201cAfter many hours of prayer, talking to my parents, and rereading my words online I can see more clearly just how hurtful my words were,\u201d Lauten wrote in a post that was published just before she made her Facebook page private. In a phone interview on Monday, Lauten told NBC News her resignation was \u201cin the works\u201d. Congressman Fincher\u2019s chief of staff, Jessica Carter, said Lauten had resigned. At the annual turkey pardon, Malia and Sasha appeared slightly bored as they watched their father pardon birds named Mac and Cheese. Photos of the sisters casting exasperated looks at one another as their father spoke sparked mostly playful comments on social media and from some media outlets. In a dizzying turn, some Republicans criticized the news media\u2019s coverage of Lauten\u2019s comments, calling the attention politically biased. \u201cChildren, especially the first daughters, are off limits. While the comments were inappropriate and insensitive, the mainstream media\u2019s coverage of this story is appalling,\u201d said the Republican National Committee communications director, Sean Spicer, in a series of tweets on Monday. \u201cIn over 20 years in politics I have never seen 1 of the countless inappropriate comments by Democrats ever covered to a faction [sic] of this.\u201d Roy Herron, chairman of the Tennessee Democratic Party, called Lauten\u2019s words \u201ccruel, outrageous and inexcusable\u201d, an \u201cunprecedented low in Washington mudslinging\u201d and \u201cabsolutely toxic for our civic life and political culture\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
