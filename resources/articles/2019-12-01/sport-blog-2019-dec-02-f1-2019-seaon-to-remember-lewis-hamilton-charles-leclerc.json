In a class of his own, his sixth championship was defined by opening with an almost crushing, relentless run that all but had the job done by the summer break. After Valtteri Bottas started strongly and the teammates shared two wins apiece, Hamilton found another plane. Four from four followed including harassing Sebastian Vettel into an error in Canada, a tyre management masterclass in Monaco and a clinical, precision dissection in France where he finished 18 seconds ahead. Silverstone and Hungary were standouts too, as was Mexico. The 34-year-old was near flawless, Germany being almost the only exception. His touch and control were unmatched in a season that showcased a sportsman at the peak of his powers. Leclerc\u2019s impressive Ferarri debut Few imagined Charles Leclerc could arrive at Ferrari in his first season for the Scuderia and rise to the challenge with such consummate ability. In only his second season in F1, Leclerc gave notice he has every chance to be a future world champion. Lined up against the four-time champion Vettel, who was given lead\u2011driver status, and under the scrutiny and spotlight of driving for Ferrari, the 22-year-old was majestic. His run in only the second round in Bahrain was magnificent, that of a driver beyond his years and a win was denied only by a mechanical problem. He scored the most poles this season with seven and deservedly took victories at Monza and Spa. Of course he made errors but after every one he appeared to emerge wiser and stronger. Other drivers have wilted under similar pressure, Leclerc blossomed. Verstappen shows champion quality Since his crash in practice at Monaco last year, after which he faced considerable criticism for his driving style, Max Verstappen has developed as a more complete driver. This season he exhibited the qualities that define him as a champion in waiting. The aggressive, daring instincts that make him so compelling to watch remain, as demonstrated in his pass on Leclerc in Austria and again in Abu Dhabi, but they have been tempered with more control and judgment. His battle with Leclerc at Silverstone was equally gripping while his win in the wet in Germany was a tour de force as all around him fell apart at the Hockenheimring. Perhaps most indicative of how far he has come was the clinical victory, having been on top all weekend, in Brazil. Verstappen\u2019s fifth season in F1 was his best yet. McLaren\u2019s resurgence There is a way to go until they are back fighting with the big three but seeing a resurgent McLaren is only good for F1. Their fourth place in the championship is their highest finish since 2012 and was thoroughly deserved as they were consistently the best of the rest. With a car that was competitive, the team proved to be able to step up to match it with their execution. Better still in Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz they have a formidable driver pairing. Britain\u2019s Norris proved every bit of his potential in a debut season of which he and the team can be proud. He was not awed by going wheel to wheel with Hamilton and Vettel, and was impressively mature in coping with setbacks out of his control. Sainz, too, showed exactly why he has long been highly rated. His pass on Alexander Albon and Daniil Kvyat up the hill at Monaco was breathtaking. The mid-season purple patch A largely turgid French Grand Prix closed with Mercedes and Hamilton looking to run away with the season and perhaps fears the racing would subsequently not deliver, but a sequence of meetings following that were stunning. Austria was gripping with Verstappen hunting Leclerc; then Silverstone was an end-to-end tumult of passing, scrapping and incident, with the drivers coming away once more with high praise for the old airfield. Chaos, error and drama followed in Germany at a race where second place was held by nine drivers and the crowd roared their approval of Verstappen\u2019s win. Then in Hungary Hamilton and Mercedes came back at Red Bull and Verstappen. It was the first time they had been wheel to wheel and unmissable. The four-race sequence was salutary reminder that F1 can still deliver like no other series. The lows \u2026 Ferrari fight falls away After winter testing every indication was that Ferrari were going into the season with a pace advantage. A real fight at the front with Mercedes was highly anticipated. Within four races it had almost entirely dissipated. Their engine indeed had the edge but it transpired they lacked the balance, downforce and grip to exploit it on the majority of tracks. While Mercedes proved they had their front-wing concept working perfectly, Ferrari were foundering. Even with an advantage, the Scuderia, Vettel and Leclerc would have had to be at the top of their games to challenge Mercedes and often they were not. With the car not where they needed it to be, and Vettel in particular finding it a handful, they swiftly fell away. Ferrari\u2019s disappointment at failing to challenge was echoed by fans spoiling for a good fight. Hubert\u2019s death at Spa The death of the Frenchman Anthoine Hubert in an F2 race during the Belgian F1 Grand Prix weekend at Spa was a huge blow for the sport and a tragedy for everyone involved. Hubert died after a high-speed accident when exiting Eau Rouge. The 22-year-old went off and, having hit the barriers and returned to the track, then took a second impact from the car of Juan Manuel Correa, who could do nothing to avoid it. Hubert was taken to the medical centre but died shortly afterwards. Correa had to receive extensive leg and spinal surgery and is beginning a lengthy recovery process. The accident was so severe that it shocked everyone, but there was also great sadness this year at the deaths of Niki Lauda and the FIA race director Charlie Whiting. In each case the racing community came together in grief and sympathy and to pay tribute, displaying the very best of the sport at some of its lowest ebbs. Worst ever season for Williams For Williams the final chequered flag can surely not have fallen soon enough on a season they will want to forget. Their car was unfinished for the opening days of the first test and when they finally put it on track it was way off the pace, lacked downforce and stability and the team became rooted to the back of the grid. With only one point, this is their worst season in a 42-year history that has returned nine constructor titles and seven drivers\u2019 championships. There was no pleasure to be had in seeing the team who epitomise the spirit of racing in F1 brought so low. Yet in the midst of all this Britain\u2019s George Russell, in his rookie season, managed to tame the recalcitrant beast with a series of performances that gave notice as to why he, too, has a such a promising career in front of him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
