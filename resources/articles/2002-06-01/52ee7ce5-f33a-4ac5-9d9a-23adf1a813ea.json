He promised to bring concrete proposals to improve the situation at a meeting of Fifa's executive committee next week. \"The refereeing has been the only negative aspect of this World Cup,\" Blatter said, replying to howls of protest in Italy over a string of controversial decisions which eventually saw them knocked out by South Korea on Tuesday. \"Sadly, and it pains me greatly, there have been exceptional circumstances and coincidences that saw many errors consecutively made against the same team, Italy,\" he said in an interview with the Italian daily Gazzetta dello Sport. This directly contradicted other Fifa officials who have praised the refereeing. On Wednesday Fifa's director of communications Keith Cooper defended the refereeing at the finals, saying officials were subject to error like anyone else. \"It is always going to happen. The inaccuracies have been kept to a minimum,\" he said. But yesterday his boss took a very different line in a surprising departure from the olympian detachment normally associated with a Fifa president. \"The [referees] have been quite good but the [linesmen] have been a disaster, especially when it comes to offside... they haven't even realised that it is better to award an offside goal than to disallow a good goal. We will remind linesmen of our long-standing directive: in doubt, don't raise the flag.\" Italy claim they had five efforts in three games wrongly struck off by linesmen. Blatter said it was particularly unfortunate in the case of the decision against Damiano Tommasi in extra-time against the Koreans as it would have been the winning golden goal. He added: \"[Francesco] Totti's sending-off against Korea was neither a penalty nor a dive. A referee with a feeling [for the game] would not have shown him the card, bearing in mind the same player had already been booked.\" He suggested that fast-tracking of former professional footballers into top-level refereeing could be a way forward. The Ecuadorian referee Byron Moreno has defended his decision. \"I would do it again. I don't even have to watch the replays... Totti dived,\" he said in an interview with Il Messaggero newspaper published yesterday. Italy's coach Giovanni Trapattoni complained: \"We were continually called back, rebuked and threatened; there was nothing of the sort for the other side. I worked [the referee] out quickly and realised we were playing against an extra opponent.\" In Ecuador, by contrast, Moreno has been highly praised. \"When the big teams go out they always have to find a scapegoat, in this case the referee,\" wrote El Universo. Blatter suggested that future World Cups might see fewer officials from the smaller footballing countries. Answering a question about \"Third World\" officials, he told Gazzetta: \"A World Cup that receives the best players and teams in the world should be overseen by the best referees regardless of their nationality... from now on we will call in the best, full stop, even if they come from just a handful of countries.\" The impression that Fifa's right hand did not know what the left hand was doing was reinforced when the spokesman for Fifa's referees' committee, Edgardo Codesal yesterday insisted that \"the referees in general have done a very good job\". Codesal also said that Fifa planned to restrict replays of controversial incidents on the big screens at stadiums during matches. \"We support showing exciting plays but not slow- motion or repetitive images of plays that highlight questionable decisions by referees.\" While accepting Italy had been unlucky to be knocked out, Blatter urged restraint on the part of Italy's outraged team, officials and supporters, saying that not only the officials but their players had made decisive mistakes. \"I call on Italian football to display some dignity and fair play because you can tell a great side more by the way it accepts defeat than by the way it handles victory.\" Italy were not the only side unhappy with the refereeing, he claimed, saying Turkey, Slovenia, Spain, Belgium and Mexico had all complained. Blatter's comments in an Italian newspaper may have been partly to soothe hurt feelings. They could also be seen as another shot in Fifa's internal battle, which saw Blatter face down a fierce challenge to his presidency on the eve of the World Cup. He stressed that refereeing in Japan and South Korea had been the responsibility of his departing general secretary and now bitter enemy Michel Zen-Ruffinen and promised to tackle the refereeing issue next week \"in the first executive committee of my second term\". Codesal, a Mexican who refereed the 1990 final, tried to stand against Blatter's staunch ally Jack Warner for the presidency of the Concacaf confederation. When his candidacy was blocked on a technicality, Zen-Ruffinen intervened to support him, widening the breach with Blatter. Finally the beneficiaries of the alleged refereeing mistakes on Tuesday were South Korea. And one of the prime movers behind the recent campaign to unseat Blatter was Fifa's vice-president Chung Mong-joon, who is Korean. For the Italians, meanwhile, the only consolation is that Pierluigi Collina now looks to be a shoo-in to referee the final. Bones of contention Brazil v Turkey, 2-1 While waiting to take a corner, Rivaldo is hit in the knee with the ball. The Brazilian, holding his face, falls to the floor and Hakan Unsal, the Turk held responsible, is shown the red card. Rivaldo is later fined \u00a34,500 for \"simulation\". Senegal v Uruguay, 3-3 El Hadji Diouf throws himself over the Uruguayan keeper, the contact-free dive winning a penalty. Two minutes from time Richard Morales gains revenge. Neither defender tracking him tries a tackle but he executes a perfect double pike for another penalty. Italy v Croatia, 1-2 Christian Vieri is ruled offside before heading home, despite having been level with the last defender when he started his run. Then Filippo Inzaghi is penalised for shirt-pulling as Marco Materazzi's through-ball finds its way into the Croatian net. Brazil v Belgium, 2-0 Belgium lose the chance to go ahead before half-time as Marc Wilmots' headed goal is disallowed for a \"push\" on Roque Junior. But contact seems negligible. South Korea v Italy, 2-1 Italy's Francesco Totti receives a second yellow for diving against South Korea although the defender Song Chong-gug gets the ball and also crashes into the Italian, who fell to the ground."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
