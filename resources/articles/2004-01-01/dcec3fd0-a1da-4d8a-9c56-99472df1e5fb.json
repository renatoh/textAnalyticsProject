Deano's Beeno, a 9-2 chance who went on to finish fourth, was typically reluctant to line up and jump off, but the officials felt that McCoy's attempts to persuade him to race went well beyond acceptable limits. Explaining the decision to ban him from January 12-16 for improper riding, William Nunneley, the stipendiary steward, said that after an inquiry, the stewards \"found that McCoy had struck his mount approximately 50 times within two minutes.\" Nunneley added: \"The horse is well-known to be difficult. It was mulish going down to the start and McCoy asked the starter for more time to give him a chance to line up with the rest of the field. But having said all that, these rules are in place to protect the horses and clearly what McCoy did was unacceptable.\" McCoy's ban covers a Monday-to-Friday period, leaving him free to ride in the Victor Chandler Chase at Ascot and then return for the Lanzarote Hurdle meeting at Kempton the following weekend. However, he is still just a few winners clear of Richard Johnson in an unusually close race for the jockeys' title, while a suspension for hitting a horse before the start of a race is, to say the least, an embarrassing way for jumping's leading jockey to start the new year. When it came to the action after the tapes went up, the names on the winners' saddlecloths here yesterday - Nicholls, Pipe, Jonjo O'Neill - were the same ones that will be expected to dominate the Festival meeting in less than three months' time. Yet while Paul Nicholls predictably saddled Santenay to take the novice chase, it was his former wife, Bridget, who took one of the day's major prizes, as Lord Noelie - with McCoy in the saddle - provided the first success of her nascent training career. It is almost four years since Lord Noelie won the Royal &amp; SunAlliance Chase at the Millennium Festival, and he had not managed to find his way back to the winners' enclosure in 13 subsequent starts before he lined up for the Tote Bookmakers' Handicap Chase yesterday. Since joining Nicholls' yard from Henrietta Knight a few months ago, though, Lord Noelie had shown signs of a return to form. He was always travelling well as Gunther McBride and Montifault set a decent pace, and snatched a two-length lead on the final turn that he never threatened to surrender. \"We've had 16 runners so far and a lot of them have been knocking on the door,\" Nicholls said, \"but I was starting to wonder when we would get a winner. I thought he would run well today because he needs good ground and he has to go left-handed, and he didn't run too badly last time behind Kingscliff when the ground changed and went against him.\" Santenay, who justified odds of 4-7 in the two-mile novice chase, was introduced at 25-1 in the Arkle Trophy betting by Cashmans, but is just as likely to contest a handicap at the Festival if the ground is anything but lightning-fast. Santenay increased Paul Nicholls' lead in the trainers' championship, but he had to settle for second prize in the showcase handicap hurdle, after the hot favourite Perouse found absolutely nothing on the run-in and allowed Demi Beau to gallop on to victory. O'Neill, meanwhile, will enter Sh Boom for the Stayers' Hurdle after his narrow defeat of Crystal d'Ainay in the Spa Hurdle. Both horses are 25-1 for the Festival race with Victor Chandler."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
