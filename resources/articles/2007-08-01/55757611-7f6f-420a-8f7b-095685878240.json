The 27-year-old, who is on loan at Leicester from Sunderland, lost consciousness in the dressing room at half-time and was described as \"very seriously ill\" by Leicester's chief executive, Tim Davies. Clarke later regained consciousness and was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre where late last night he was in a stable condition in the coronary care unit. \"When Clive went into the dressing room he collapsed and was very seriously ill,\" Davies said. \"He was taken away in an ambulance to hospital. He did offer a few words in the ambulance. Our thoughts and prayers are with Clive and his family, we hope he makes a speedy recovery. Clive's sick, he's on his way to hospital. That is pretty difficult, not only for the Leicester players but the Nottingham players too. \"Everyone is very distressed and shaken up as you can imagine. This is the first time we are aware of anything happening to Clive,\" said Davies, who praised Forest's cooperation on the night. \"I would like to say a big thank you to Nottingham Forest for dealing with the matter so fast and to [the manager] Colin Calderwood, [chief executive] Mark Arthur and [chairman] Nigel Doughty for calling off the match so quickly,\" he said. Clarke collapsed in the visitors' dressing room with Leicester trailing 1-0 after Junior Agogo's header on 29 minutes. Paramedics rushed down the tunnel to attend to Clarke and the restart was initially delayed for 15 minutes before a further 10-minute delay was announced over the Tannoy. Calderwood and his Leicester counterpart, Martin Allen, then emerged from the tunnel to announce that the game had been abandoned. \"We are afraid that due to the serious illness of a Leicester player both clubs have agreed to postpone the match,\" Calderwood said. Forest's chief executive, Mark Arthur said: \"Football is secondary to human issues and as soon as we found out the serious nature of Clive's situation we went straight to the referee and said we would do whatever is right by Leicester. They are going through a trauma at the moment and the three parties very quickly agreed the game should be abandoned.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
