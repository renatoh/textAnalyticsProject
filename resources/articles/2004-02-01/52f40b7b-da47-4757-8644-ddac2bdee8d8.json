The proposal, which has the backing of Ask's founders, Adam and Samuel Kaye, makes TDR Capital and Capricorn Ventures - the private equity firms which own Pizza Express - strong favourites to acquire the 172 Ask outlets. The move, which still needs the backing of shareholders, came just minutes ahead of a deadline set by regulators for TDR to confirm its bid. The offer is from the same consortium that trumped former Pizza Express chairman Luke Johnson in his attempt to land the business last year. TDR and Capricorn eventually acquired Pizza Express for \u00a3277.8m. The Restaurant Group, which owns Caffe Uno and was previously known as City Centre Restaurants, sparked the tussle for Ask in December with a cash and shares approach worth around \u00a3177m. The group, which also owns Garfunkel's and Frankie &amp; Benny's, had hoped to create one of the UK's largest independent catering chains with more than 400 restaurants. St Albans-based Ask, which opened its first restaurant in 1993, has the Ask, Zizzi and Jo Shmo brands. Adam and Samuel Kaye will remain with the enlarged business, while the bidders have the backing of the family's 9% shareholding. Manjit Dale, a founding partner at TDR Capital, said: \"Adam and Samuel Kaye and their team have built a great business with excellent prospects. We intend to build on their success by developing the leading full-service restaurant chain in the UK.\" The new owners of Pizza Express recently reported a pick-up in sales as like-for-like growth reached 7% over the Christmas period. Strong gains were also seen at The Restaurant Group and Ask Central over the same period."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
