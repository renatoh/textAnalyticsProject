No National Lottery game can possibly be a tax - be it on stupidity or anything else - as there is no compulsion to play. Over 70% of the UK adult population play on a regular basis, but they choose to buy those lottery tickets; they don't choose to pay their income tax or VAT. As Marina is very interested in sport, I'm surprised she isn't supportive of Dream Number. It is the first draw-based game to be dedicated to raising funds for the London 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games - and will play a major role in achieving the National Lottery's target of raising \u00a31.5bn for the games. Dedicated scratchcards and online Instant Win games have already raised \u00a316.3m - \u00a32.3m above target - for London 2012. So it looks like our players are keen to support the games.
