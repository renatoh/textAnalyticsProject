ReDiviDer's core lineup (alto sax, trombone, bass and drums) is augmented on some tracks by UK guests including pianist Kit Downes and cellist Ben Davis \u2013 and Jacobson's writing for nimbly impulsive alto saxist Nick Roth and his tonally subtle trombonist Colm O'Hara also brings Charles Mingus to mind. A couple of electronically mashed episodes of studio backchat act as 40-second interludes, and the five longish band tracks include snappy postbop themes and spacey trombone soloing (Twin Kodes), free-jazzy squalling resolving in horn fanfares (Animal Code), and warm horn harmonies surrounding rich cello-bowing and elegantly squirming freebop alto sax (Bin Saved). Velvet Pouch, with its Mingus-like sax/brass soulfulness turning to brittle, Tim Berneian hooks and fine work from Alex Roth on guitar, is a standout. Berne and Jim Black fans, among others, will feel at home with this variously melodious and unswervingly exploratory music."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
