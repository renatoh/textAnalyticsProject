The Ukraine international was allowed to join Hertha Berlin on a season-long loan last summer in the wake of Keane's arrival at Liverpool and Rafael Ben\u00edtez's decision that the 29-year-old had become surplus to requirements. Voronin remains under contract at Liverpool, however, and with Ben\u00edtez's striking options reduced by the Republic of Ireland captain's reunion with Tottenham Hotspur, as well as Fernando Torres' supporting cast failing to impress at Portsmouth on Saturday, the prospect of an enforced return to Merseyside has been raised. \"There have not been any talks between [Hertha's general manager] Dieter Hoeness, my agent and me,\" Voronin told Bild newspaper. \"I know my agent has talked with Liverpool though. \"I still have a contract there. And now Keane has been sold. Before he came last summer I was playing regularly under Ben\u00edtez. With Keane gone, Liverpool don't have many strikers again.\" Voronin scored five goals in 19 league games for Liverpool last season, his only campaign at the club so far, having failed to build on an initially encouraging start to life at Anfield. The Ukrainian also struggled to settle in England and admits his preference would be to remain in Berlin. \"I would happily remain here,\" said Voronin, who has spent the majority of his career in the Bundesliga. \"I like it here, as do my wife and children. I just want clarity as soon as possible.\" Torres, meanwhile, is confident Liverpool can sustain their challenge to Manchester United for the Premier League title despite the run of six draws in 10 games that helped hand the initiative to Old Trafford. The Spaniard's late goals against Portsmouth and Chelsea in successive league games have spared Liverpool two further stalemates and underscored how pivotal his form and fitness is to Ben\u00edtez this season. Torres, who is expected to play some part against England in Seville on Wednesday, said: \"We began very well and at the moment we're going through a period which isn't the best. But we're not bad, maybe it's just that we're stifled by lesser teams who are happy with a draw. We are better against the big teams and we have to show that against Real Madrid. \"It all depends on how you look at things. You can be pessimistic and think we have been knocked out of the cup and that it was tough for us to win. Or you can think positively, which is what I do, and see that we are fighting for the league, that we're in the last 16 of the Champions League, that on the whole we are better than previous years. That's what I think.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
