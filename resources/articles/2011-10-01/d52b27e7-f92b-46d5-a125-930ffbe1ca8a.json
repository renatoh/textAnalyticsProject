I was money orientated, driven by success, I wore a suit and tie, and wheeled my wheelie suitcase around under tall buildings in London, talking rubbish. I wasn't so fussed about making friends, or about what other people thought of me, I was aiming high, like those big tall London buildings. I wanted to show people that if you have a dream you can achieve it \u2026 Hang on, no I didn't. There were dreams, but \u2026 well this is probably not the right place to go into them. I was unconfident, unfocused, unattractive, un pretty much everything. I thought about girls, but couldn't talk to them. Or to anyone really. No one understood, it was so unfair. I shut myself in my room, listened to music and squeezed my spots. It never occurred to me to start even one business, let alone three. I never made it on to Young Apprentice (BBC1). Well, Young Apprentice hadn't actually (quite) started when I was 16. But I wouldn't have made it on, even if it had. I'm looking at this lot \u2013 Harry and Gbemi, Hannah and Haya, James and Mahamed etc. And they are a different species from the one I was. And from all the teenagers I know. I'll be honest with you, I like Young Me better. And I hate \u2013 certainly did hate \u2013 Young Me. The new candidates look normal enough on the outside, apart from being dressed inappropriately for their age. But then they open their mouths and this nonsense comes out, the same nonsense spoken on grownup Apprentice. They are exactly the same, just smaller, bonsai tossers. And it makes you wonder what's happened in their lives to make them like this. Should social services be concerned? Look at their eyes, there's something different there too. They're dark and lifeless, like little black holes, vortexes of nothing \u2013 or worse, of evil. Just thinking about them sends a chilly shiver down my spine. Lord Sugar likes them though. Loves them, he says. He loves to encourage young people, he loves to give them opportunities, he's full of love today. He sets the first task, to make ice-cream. They go back to the house, a mansion in St John's Wood, with a roof terrace, walk-in wardrobes, and some hideous art, including a big flashing anchor in the hall. One of the boys takes out a spray can, and writes a big W on the wall in front of the big anchor, to remind himself what he's well on the way to becoming \u2026 No of course he doesn't, because that would have required self-awareness, imagination, wit, and a spray can. And these people don't have any of those things. It's boys against girls. One of the girls suggests Sixth Sense as a team name. That's what I'm talking about \u2013 the eyes! They settle for Kinetic. The boys chose Atomic. Mmmm, Atomic ice-cream \u2013 it makes you glow in the dark and gives you cancer. No one wants to be team leader. Ha, where are all your leadership skills now? They're not very impressive at the tasks either. The boys fight, the girls can't add up. Are they all talk and nothing else? To be fair they do sell their ice-cream, but mainly through intimidation and bullying. And by not being entirely up front and open about some of the hidden costs. Like an extra 20p for a cone! Back in the boardroom, and it's time for the Sugar show. \"I mean never mind Ben and Jerry's, it's more like bloody Tom and Jerry,\" he manages to stumble out. He's like a machine with a handle, that you turn and a previously prepared line comes out \u2013 a bit jerkily, like a musical box, because it's hard to turn the handle at a constant speed, but the joke comes out eventually. \"Even though this was a task about ice cream, you're going to find out that I'm no Mr Softie.\" Well done, sir, got there in the end. Any more? Just one corny line, give it to me, dubious humour, from Lord Sugar \u2026 Then Mahamed is fired, his dream torn to shreds. But he does get a ride in Sugar's Roller, and suddenly he's just a little boy, in the back of a very big car. It's a nice touch though, a brief taste of what might have been. Either that or the whole thing is very, very wrong."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
