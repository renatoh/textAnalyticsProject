From tomorrow your Guardian Morning Briefing will take on a different look as we expand our coverage of the UK election campaign. Make sure you are subscribed to have the latest election news hit your inbox bright and early each weekday. Boris Johnson is due to visit the Queen today and then formally announce that a general election will be held on 12 December. His Conservative party\u2019s campaign has been forced on to the defensive after Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire had lacked \u201ccommon sense\u201d in following fire service advice to stay put instead of fleeing. Rees-Mogg issued a \u201cprofound apology\u201d but the Tory MP Andrew Bridgen compounded the anger of survivors and relatives by suggesting Rees-Mogg was \u201ccleverer\u201d than those who died. Meanwhile the Tories have been criticised for propagating fake news after releasing a misleadingly edited video in which Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer is made to look like he can not answer a question about Brexit. Meanwhile Conservative plans to rubbish Labour\u2019s spending plans using civil service costings have been scuppered after the head of the civil service decided that publishing the Treasury analysis only weeks before the election would be improper. This is understood to have enraged the chancellor, Sajid Javid, as it blows apart the Conservatives\u2019 plan to open their election campaign by attacking Labour\u2019s economic credibility. In a Guardian exclusive, we can reveal that Conservative candidates have been instructed by party HQ not to sign pledges on the NHS, the environment or trade deals. But supporting shooting is allowed \u201cas an important part of rural life\u201d, says an internal document that sets out boilerplate replies to questions that candidates might face. A row continues to simmer over the report into Russian interference in UK politics: Marina Litvinenko, the widow of the murdered ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko, says Boris Johnson\u2019s delay in publishing the report helps the Kremlin and feeds suspicions of a government \u201ccover-up\u201d. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 leader, Jo Swinson, has been accused of not taking sufficient action against party activist Steve Wilson, who had to apologise after claiming the Labour MP Dawn Butler had made up her experience of racism in the Commons. The Green party launches its campaign today in what it hopes to frame as \u201cthe climate election\u201d. The party will pledge to spend \u00a3100bn a year on the climate crisis, raising corporation tax and radically overhauling the tax system \u2013 all while stopping Brexit. Airport expansion would be stopped and HS2 scrapped and replaced with investment in rail electrification and local bus services. And Nigel Farage has visited leave-voting, Labour-held Bolsover \u2013 just the kind of seat he would like to steal for his Brexit party. But at least 20 of Farage\u2019s purported 600 or so candidates have already quit. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Gordon Sondland, Donald Trump\u2019s ambassador to the EU, has changed his impeachment inquiry testimony to confirm the president made an \u201cimproper\u201d demand that Ukraine investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son in return for $400m in military aid. &gt; The British backpacker Grace Millane died of strangulation during a Tinder date, a New Zealand jury has been told. The prosecution in the murder trial says the accused, 27, whose name is suppressed, took photographs of Millane\u2019s body, watched pornography, hired a carpet cleaning machine and searched online about fires in the bushland area where her body was later found buried in a suitcase he had bought. The accused man\u2019s defence is that her death was a sex game gone wrong. &gt; The world\u2019s people face \u201cuntold suffering due to the climate crisis\u201d unless there are major transformations to global society, more than 11,000 scientists have warned in a joint statement. They urge an end to population growth, leaving fossil fuels in the ground, halting forest destruction and slashing meat eating. &gt; Government ads praising the Conservatives\u2019 flagship universal credit have been banned as misleading. The advertising watchdog said they made unsubstantiated claims, including that people moved into work faster on universal credit and that jobcentres would pay an advance to people who need it. Aditya Chakrabortty writes this morning: \u201cThat campaign was paid for by taxpayers like you and me \u2026 Almost a quarter of million pounds was taken off us to lie to us.\u201d &gt; This morning in our series on children in the justice system we discuss how vulnerable youngsters in care homes across the country are being bundled off to court for damaging residential facilities or assaulting staff \u2013 showing, says one prominent MP, that the system has failed. * * * \u2018Alarming evidence\u2019 \u2013 British universities are not adequately responding to the growing risk of China and other \u201cautocracies\u201d influencing academic freedom, the foreign affairs select committee has said. It highlighted the role of officials from China-funded Confucius Institutes in confiscating papers that mentioned Taiwan at an academic conference; the use of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association as an instrument of political interference; and evidence that one or more Uighur dissidents studying in the UK had been monitored, with family back in China being harassed. The committee says there is \u201calarming evidence\u201d of meddling, some of which appears to be coordinated by the Chinese embassy in London. * * * Fishing gear litters oceans \u2013 More than 640,000 tonnes of nets, lines, pots and traps used in commercial fishing are dumped, discarded or lost in the sea every year, the same weight as 55,000 double-decker buses. Greenpeace says the gear, which is deadly to marine life, makes up the majority of large plastic pollution in the oceans. About 300 sea turtles were found dead as a result of entanglement in \u201cghost gear\u201d off the coast of Mexico last year, while in October a pregnant whale was found with fishing gear entangled inside its mouth. \u201cThe world\u2019s governments must take action to protect our global oceans and hold the under-regulated fishing industry to account for its dangerous waste,\u201d said Louisa Casson from Greenpeace UK. This should start with a strong global ocean treaty being agreed at the United Nations next year.\u201d * * * Today in Focus podcast: Mexico\u2019s war with the drug cartels Tom Phillips joins the search for some of the thousands of people who have gone missing or been murdered in the country\u2019s bloody drug wars. Plus Luke Harding on the government\u2019s delay in releasing a report on Russian meddling in UK politics. Lunchtime read: \u2018It is well known she likes to dance\u2019 In 1962, a year after the building of the Berlin Wall, three men in grey trenchcoats came to a secondary school in Mahlow on the southern outskirts of the East German capital. They took 14-year-old Regina Herrmann out of class and told her the ruling Socialist Unity party considered her father an enemy of the state, a \u201ccapitalist exploiter\u201d, because he ran his own business, a hairdressing salon. She would not be allowed to continue attending a school in the socialist one-party state, and could bury her dreams of becoming a doctor. In the coming months and years, Herrmann often had the feeling she was being followed. There were sudden rumours she was a Flittchen, an easy girl. At her father\u2019s salon, men would make lewd comments or touch her inappropriately; twice, someone tried to rape her. It was only after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 that Herrmann found in the Stasi archives documents instructing five unofficial collaborators to target her in bars and nightclubs: \u201cIt is well known,\u201d the file said, that Herrmann \u201clikes to dance and is happy for her dance partners to invite her to the bar afterwards.\u201d In communist East Germany, systematic degradation of this kind by the Stasi \u2013 the draconian state police \u2013 resulted in lost careers and mental health issues. Herrmann, now 72, is one of thousands of victims of the GDR\u2019s regime who have, until now, been denied access to long-promised support schemes. In reunified Germany, former employees of the Stasi draw generous public-sector pensions while many of their victims had their lives, careers and health ruined by its intrusions \u2013 while struggling to prove to authorities that things would have been very different if not for the police state\u2019s oppression. Sport Frank Lampard praised Chelsea\u2019s spirit after they fought back from 4-1 down to claim a point against Ajax and keep alive their hopes of reaching the last 16 of the Champions League. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was among the fresh legs brought into the Liverpool side and he scored a delightful goal in a 2-1 win over Genk at Anfield as J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side topped Group E. Granit Xhaka has been stripped of the Arsenal captaincy following his extraordinary fallout with a large section of the club\u2019s fans, Unai Emery has confirmed. Saracens have blazed a trail across Europe but a salary-cap breach has stamped an asterisk on a great club and the game. Sonny Bill Williams will be unveiled as the highest-paid player in the history of either code of rugby next week after agreeing a two-year deal with Toronto Wolfpack. The Los Angeles Chargers owner, Dean Spanos, has denied reports his team are open to moving the NFL franchise to London. And England cannot play in the Olympic Games but their success at this year\u2019s football Women\u2019s World Cup means Team GB, coached by Phil Neville, will appear in Tokyo \u2013 a concept branded unsatisfactory by three of the four constituent parts. Business Asian markets are little changed \u2013 MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan hasn\u2019t moved, with Australian shares and Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock index both up slightly. US stock futures edged lower in Asia after the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.01% on Tuesday, having reached a record high in the previous trading session. The pound is getting $1.287 and \u20ac1.163 while the FTSE is lower ahead of the open. The papers Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s comments about Grenfell victims lacking \u201ccommon sense\u201d for not leaving the burning building are the lead in the Guardian: \u201cRees-Mogg condemned over remarks on Grenfell\u201d and the i: \u201cRees-Mogg grounded by Tories\u201d. The Sun has: \u201cGod save fur Queen\u201d, with a report that the Queen has banned the use of fur on all her new outfits. Several newspapers use the story as an opportunity to run pictures of the Queen decked out in her finest furs. The news of a breakthrough DNA test for babies leads on the Mirror\u2019s front: \u201cBirth test revolution\u201d and the Express: \u201cDNA test at birth to save lives\u201d. The FT has: \u201cJavid furious as top civil servant blocks pricing of Labour pledges\u201d, the Times reports: \u201cChina tries to gag UK universities\u201d and the Mail says: \u201cRail union\u2019s mass misery for millions\u201d, with news that workers for South Western Railway will stage a 27-day strike over December and New Year\u2019s \u2013 but it manages to make the story partisan, saying the strike comes from \u201cCorbyn\u2019s militant pals\u201d. And the longest headline we have seen on any paper in some time features on today\u2019s Telegraph, which leads with a quote from Boris Johnson: \u201c\u2018The tragedy of the modern Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn is that they detest the profit motive so viscerally \u2026 they point their fingers at individuals with a relish and a vindictiveness not seen since Stalin persecuted the kulaks.\u2019\u201d Sign up The Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
