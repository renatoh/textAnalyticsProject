In a paper that suggests the underlying cause of the present pandemic is likely to be increased human contact with wildlife, scientists from Australia and the US traced which animals were most likely to share pathogens with humans. Taking 142 viruses known to have been transmitted from animals to humans over many years, they matched them to the IUCN\u2019s red list of threatened species. Domesticated animals like cattle, sheep, dogs and goats shared the highest number of viruses with humans, with eight times more animal-borne viruses than wild mammal species. Wild animals that have adapted well to human-dominated environments also share more viruses with people. Rodents, bats and primates \u2013 which often live among people, and close to houses and farms \u2013 together were implicated as hosts for nearly 75% of all viruses. Bats alone have been linked to diseases like Sars, Nipah, Marburg and Ebola. The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, found that the spillover risk was highest from threatened and endangered wild animals whose populations had declined largely due to hunting, the wildlife trade and loss of habitat. \u201cHuman encroachment into biodiverse areas increases the risk of spillover of novel infectious diseases by enabling new contacts between humans and wildlife \u2026 We found that species in the primate and bat orders were significantly more likely to harbour zoonotic viruses compared to all other orders,\u201d it said. \u201cSpillover of viruses from animals are a direct result of our actions involving wildlife and their habitat,\u201d said lead author Christine Kreuder Johnson, director of the EpiCenter for Disease Dynamics at the One Health Institute, a programme of the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. \u201cThe consequence is they\u2019re sharing their viruses with us. These actions simultaneously threaten species survival and increase the risk of spillover. In an unfortunate convergence of many factors, this brings about the kind of mess we\u2019re in now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to be really attentive to how we interact with wildlife and the activities that bring humans and wildlife together. We obviously don\u2019t want pandemics of this scale. We need to find ways to co-exist safely with wildlife, as they have no shortages of viruses to give us,\u201d said Johnson. Separately, more than 200 of the world\u2019s wildlife groups have written to the World Health Organization (WHO) calling on it to recommend to countries a highly precautionary approach to the multi-billion dollar wildlife trade, and a permanent ban on all live wildlife markets and the use of wildlife in traditional medicine. The Covid-19 pandemic, says the letter, is believed to have originated at wildlife markets in China, and to have been transmitted to humans as a result of the close proximity between wildlife and people. The groups, which include the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Zoological Society of London and Peta, say a ban on wildlife markets globally will help prevent the spread of disease, and address \u201cone of the major drivers of species extinction\u201d. \u201cThis decisive action, well within the WHO\u2019s mandate, would be an impactful first step in adopting a highly precautionary approach to wildlife trade that poses a risk to human health,\u201d says the letter. The organisations argue that zoonotic diseases are responsible for over 2 billion cases of human illness and over 2 million human deaths each year, including from Ebola, Mers, HIV, bovine tuberculosis, rabies, and leptospirosis. The letter follows acting UN biodiversity chief Elizabeth Maruma Mrema\u2019s call in the Guardian this week for a global ban on wildlife markets. Unlike the conservation groups, Mrema, the acting executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, emphasised that millions of people, particularly in Africa, depend on wild animals for food and that alternatives to wet markets are needed. In a growing sign that global organisations are embarrassed by the emergence of zoonotic diseases in traded animals, Cites, the body which regulates the international trade of animals, refused to be drawn into the growing debate about the origins of Covid-19. In a terse statement it said: \u201cMatters regarding zoonotic diseases are outside of Cites\u2019s mandate and the Secretariat does not have the competence to make comments on the recent news on the possible links between human consumption of wild animals and Covid-19.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
