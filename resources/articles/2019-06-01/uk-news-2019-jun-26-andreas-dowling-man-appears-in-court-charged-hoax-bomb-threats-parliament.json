Andreas Dowling, 23, from Torpoint, Cornwall, appeared at Exeter magistrates court on Wednesday accused of committing 30 offences in the UK and the US. He entered no plea and the case was sent to crown court. The court was told Dowling had been arrested by detectives investigating a series of hoax bomb threats made in 2014 in the US and 2016 in the UK. Dowling was arrested on Tuesday and charged with 20 counts of making hoax bomb threats to schools across England and to the Houses of Parliament in January and February 2016. He was also charged with 10 offences relating to hoax bomb threats made to US schools and police departments as well as Super Bowl XLIX between 10 October 2014 and 1 February 2015. He also allegedly made a threat to a Canadian school during the same period. The court was told the alleged offences were sophisticated and had caused major disruption. The defendant is also charged with an offence of encouraging the distribution of an indecent image of a child. The investigation was led by officers from counter-terrorism policing south-west, who were satisfied the alleged threats were not an act of terrorism. Dowling was remanded in custody. He will appear before a judge at Exeter crown court on 25 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
