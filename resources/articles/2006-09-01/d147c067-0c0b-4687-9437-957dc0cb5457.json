Dramatic demographic changes make a powerful case for this: more people aged over 80 than under five; more over 60 than under 16. By the middle of this century, estimated average life expectancy will be 87 for men and 90 for women. But it is not just about numbers. We must consider people's expectations. The \"baby boomer\" generation born after the second world war is reaching 60. They are less deferential to authority. They will make greater demands and expect to have their voice heard. To meet the requirements of these new consumers of services for older people, we must remodel the way we provide services. The creation of the welfare state had at its heart the need to provide protection against sickness, unemployment, and want, and to provide for retirement. To meet these challenges, a paternalistic, top-down, uniform approach was adopted. The new welfare state must be more about choice: being a facilitator rather than just a provider; engaging and empowering individuals and the communities in which they live and giving control over the options available to them and the services they receive. In some parts of the welfare state, this more responsive approach is already taking place, but it needs to go further and become the norm. It has to be regarded by the government as a fundamental part of its modernisation and reform agenda. It will be a challenge, but it will also provide new opportunities, in particular the chance to bring together a coherent and comprehensive package that can meet baby-boomer expectations. The current comprehensive spending review is key to determining the new offer that can be made to older people. This is said to be a \"zero-based\" review, which means starting from scratch without any preconceptions. The amount available for public spending will be tight and there will be competing demands. But its outcome will determine priorities for the next 10 years. The demographic changes taking place will be a major consideration of the review - that's a positive sign. The danger is that providing a new deal for older people will appear too difficult. This would be a mistake. Leaving things as they are is not an option. The government has made improvements in the lives of many pensioners. Good progress has been made in tackling pensioner poverty and in combating inequality in old age. But there has to be a recognition that more needs to be done - and in a different way. The focus must be on retaining independence - too often older people are regarded as passive recipients rather than active individuals with their own opinions about their needs. Age must not be used as an excuse to deny someone control over how they wish to live. This means providing suitable guidance and advice so that choice is well informed, with budgets devolved to the individual wherever appropriate. It is important, too that the forthcoming Commission for Equality and Human Rights (the single equality body that will replace the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Commission for Racial Equality and the Disability Rights Commission) takes older people seriously, especially in the light of new employment equality regulations that prohibit direct and indirect age discrimination and harassment and victimisation on grounds of age. Longer lives are a cause for celebration, not a social problem. It must be a top political priority to ensure that active independence and choice becomes a key part of our new deal for older people. \u00b7 Stephen Byers is Labour MP for North Tyneside.
