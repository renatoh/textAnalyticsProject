This was the second in the winter-long series held on the velodrome where Cavendish raced in the distant days when he was just a schoolboy with some very big dreams. \"It's great to be back on the track, I love it,\" said the Manxman. \"Especially here, where I started, in meetings like this.\" Indeed, back in winter 2003, at the age of 18, Cavendish turned out at the very first Revolution meeting, riding in the colours of Dataphonic RT. \"The Manx Express has arrived,\" roared the presenter, the four-times world track champion Hugh Porter and, as Cavendish circled the track to be presented to the sell-out crowd, the 26-year-old received a deafening ovation from spectators who had formed lengthy queues beforehand. The Revolution is unique, in that youth and elite riders are united in teams which compete for the overall standings: Cavendish was guesting as team captain for the Howies squad, giving youngsters such as 16-year-old Cardiff rider Zac May a chance to learn from him. \"He's my hero,\" May said, \"he's been making sure we're all right, making sure if there's anything we need we're to tell him.\" The adaptation from steady road riding to the brief, intense efforts of track racing was not going to be easy and, with a week's riding on the road behind him, Cavendish clearly felt it. \"It's difficult, I went into the red as soon as I made an effort in the first race, and I'm going to be tired after this,\" he said. In the earlier events he was given little room for manoeuvre, but in the final event of the evening, a 60-lap scratch race, Cavendish showed the crowd what they had come to see: cool calculation followed by a searing burst over the final lap to come home the winner to more deafening applause. He will be hoping, no doubt, that it proves a promising omen for his next appearance in these parts, at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in Salford on 22 December. Highlights from Revolution will be shown on ITV4 at 7pm on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
