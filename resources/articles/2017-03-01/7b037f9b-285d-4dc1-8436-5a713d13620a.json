But sometimes it\u2019s about the jeans. Seven-year-old Grayson Powell bowled the game of his life to win his team of three a youth bowling tournament in the Newfoundland city of St John\u2019s on Saturday. But shortly after his 171-point game propelled Riverdale to the title, Grayson was disqualified, and was unable to collect his prize. The reason? He wore the wrong trousers. \u201cThe rule is you have to wear black pants,\u201d Todd Powell, Grayson\u2019s father, explained to CBC. Grayson was wearing faded black jeans \u2013 which were evidently not black enough. So as Grayson waited in line to collect his gold medal, Gord Davis, the provincial director at Youth Bowl Canada, informed Grayson\u2019s parents that their son was to be disqualified for his sartorial breach. Powell Sr said he was distinctly unimpressed with Davis\u2019s ruling. \u201cIf this is what sport is about when it comes to kids \u2026 shame on them.\u201d But Davis\u2019s organisation insists it did nothing wrong, and said the dress code for Provincial A tournaments had been in place \u201cfor decades\u201d. In an impassioned defence on Facebook that ran to 2,600 words and seemed to have been written by Davis, Newfoundland &amp; Labrador YBC rejected accusations of wrongdoing and said simply: rules were rules. \u201cMr Todd Powell knew full aware of the dress code, and sent his child to Provincials knowing that it was against the rules,\u201d the post read. \u201cWhy is NL YBC in the wrong here, when parents knowingly broke the rules, and we are the bad guys? \u201cWe did nothing wrong. Stop blaming NL YBC and [president] Gord Davis for something that should never have had happened. Ignorance of a rule \u2026 is not the fault of the governing body.\u201d Powell Sr pointed out to CBC that his son Grayson had been allowed to bowl throughout. Why wait until he had finished to disqualify him? \u201cThe problem I have with it \u2026 they allowed him to bowl prior. He owes these three kids a written apology.\u201d YL NBC said additional opinions had been needed with other executive members before a ruling could be made. \u201cI was not going to embarrass those kids by stopping play and making a scene,\u201d Davis wrote. Later, on the same Facebook page, Gord Davis said that even though the decision could not be reversed, Grayson and his team would be presented with gold medals in a special ceremony because the situation had been \u201cblown out of proportion for simple communication problems\u201d. \u201cI informed Todd that the kids had bowled magnificently and yes they deserve to be recognized for their accomplishments,\u201d Davis wrote. \u201cWe will make sure these kids are taken care of first because that is what we are all about. We apologized for what decision we had to make and the fact that they were not relayed any information during the first or third game.\u201d The governing body said it wished to move on from the controversy and simply concentrate on bowling. \u201cAny kid can play this sport,\u201d the post read. \u201cLots of kids won\u2019t play sports because they feel they don\u2019t belong and they are bullied, or just not good enough. Well, bowling is not like that: we treat all kids equally.\u201d Providing, of course, they\u2019re wearing the right pants."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
