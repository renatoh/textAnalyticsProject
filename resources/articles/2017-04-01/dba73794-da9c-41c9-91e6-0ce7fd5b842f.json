Barkley has been contacted by Merseyside police after CCTV footage emerged of the England international being punched in the face by an unidentified man in a Liverpool bar early on Monday. Koeman has no issues with the 23-year-old socialising following Everton\u2019s 4-2 win over Leicester City on Sunday, explaining the player was driving and not drinking alcohol, but advised against venturing into bars in the city centre. The incident came hours after the Everton manager reiterated that Barkley will be sold this summer should he decide against signing a new contract. However, he does not think Barkley will seek a move as a direct result of being attacked. Koeman said: \u201cI am not concerned, no. He\u2019s a local boy and OK, it\u2019s a little bit about what happened in town in an evening, although I don\u2019t know what happened. On one side it\u2019s really nice to be part of that passion of the fans and the clubs in Liverpool, but on the other side you have to look out for these kinds of things and that is what the boy needs to learn from what happened last weekend. \u201cI go out, yes, but in other places and when people don\u2019t see me it\u2019s better. We spoke about that. Maybe it\u2019s better to stay away from these kind of places but, OK, it\u2019s difficult because then always you like to have a normal life. Also as a football player you know you\u2019re a famous boy in Liverpool \u2013 so stay out of that, and maybe it\u2019s the best lesson he\u2019s learned even last weekend. But we will see.\u201d Barkley has 14 months remaining on his Everton contract and talks resumed two weeks ago with his representatives over a new deal, although there is still no agreement in sight. Koeman insists Everton \u201cneed to know the answer before the end of the season\u201d but believes the club is the best place for the boyhood Evertonian to fulfil his ambition of playing Champions League football. \u201cEverton is the best place for him to continue,\u201d the manager said. \u201cI spoke to him a few weeks ago and he said his ambition is the Champions League. I told him I have the same ambition.\u201d Koeman added: \u201cBefore the end of the season I think is the most ideal situation for the club to know what happens with the boy because if you don\u2019t sign a new contract, then we don\u2019t [want] him going through the last season of contract. I think for players it\u2019s normal business. OK, but if you still don\u2019t know that decision by the end of the season then something is wrong. You have situations like in Holland when players don\u2019t sign a new contract and don\u2019t leave. They wait until the Bosman and they go for free. That\u2019s the worst scenario and you don\u2019t accept that at Everton. \u201cI spoke to Ross and he knows my feelings. It is not necessary to talk again about a new contract. He knows what I like. I also told the club we like to keep the player because he is really a player for the future of the club. The rest is up to the board to get an agreement.\u201d Everton are in talks with the left-back Sead Kolasinac, whose contract with Schalke expires this summer. The Bosnia and Herzegovina international came close to joining Chelsea in January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
