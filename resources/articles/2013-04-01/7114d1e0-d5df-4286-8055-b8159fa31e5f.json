Two men, aged 20 and 54, were arrested during an operation in Northland Road, Derry, on Friday night. Detectives said suspected firearms, ammunition and a pipe bomb were seized. The area was sealed off after police stopped two vehicles at around 8pm. Several homes had to be evacuated until yesterday morning as army bomb experts made the area safe. Chief Superintendent Stephen Cargin praised residents and the community for their patience during the operation. \"We have seen again the blatant disregard of those individuals willing to endanger life in our community. I have nothing but praise for the officers involved in the operation,\" he said. \u25a0 Twenty-five petrol bombs were hurled by children as young as 14 during street disturbances in Derry. The disorder broke out when youngsters began throwing stones from the mainly nationalist Bishop Street into the loyalist Fountain estate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
