Will MPs cross-examining Sir Philip Green on Wednesday be able to put in as good a performance as Cruise in a A Few Good Men and get under the skin of the famously short-tempered tycoon who is on the ropes for his role in the biggest British high-street collapse in nearly a decade? It\u2019s obviously not a murder trial, although few would dispute that BHS suffered a slow death at the tycoon\u2019s hands, but Green is on public trial for his decision to offload the 88-year-old chain to a consortium, led by a former racing driver and serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell, which had neither the financial firepower nor retail skills to pull off a turnaround that he, the King of High Street, had failed to effect. On Friday, the Daily Mail spoke for middle Britain with a front page that screamed: \u201cStrip \u2018Sir\u2019 Shifty of his title\u201d. An extreme censure that would put the once lauded businessman in the company of disgraced bank chief Fred Goodwin, who drove the Royal Bank of Scotland to the wall. The case against Green is that over an extended period his family and its other shareholders took out large sums of money from BHS, a tally of close to \u00a3600m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans during 15 years of ownership. A year on from its sale to the consortium for \u00a31, BHS is in administration and the taxpayer faces a \u00a336m hit on unpaid VAT and statutory compensation owed to workers. Meanwhile, Arcadia, owned by his wife, Tina, which owns a host of other high street names including Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins, is a secured creditor \u2013 the group first in line to receive money back from a liquidation \u2013 and stands to recoup \u00a335m. Then there is the BHS pension fund that, with its \u00a3571m black hole, is being assessed for rescue by the Pension Protection Fund, the pensions lifeboat, an outcome that would surely shame a knight of the realm. Green is being pilloried by a press that gilded his reputation as a retail Midas capable of selling coals to Newcastle. His family\u2019s fortune, much of it in the name of his Monaco-based wife, is put at \u00a33.2bn, amassed via a series of deal in the 00s: BHS for \u00a3200m in 2000 and, two years later, the \u00a3800m purchase of Arcadia. The \u00a31.2bn dividend the Greens paid themselves from Arcadia in 2005 still holds the record as the biggest payout in British corporate history. Critics of his business style argue his wealth has been amassed through clever financial engineering, cost-cutting and squeezing suppliers. Green\u2019s lifestyle of conspicuous consumption \u2013 a new \u00a3100m super yacht, Lionheart, is on the way \u2013 relayed via paparazzi shots of him partying with Kate Moss and enjoying Caribbean getaways with Simon Cowell was tolerated while he was judged to be a wealth creator, but not now. Lord Myners, a former City minister who was chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer when Green launched a takeover bid in 2004, is keen to get to the bottom of the BHS collapse. \u201cWe have learned that over an extended period Green took large sums of money out of BHS and underinvested in the business,\u201d he said. \u201cHe also allowed a large pension deficit to arise and the pension trustees failed to take corrective action.\u201d Some claim that Green was duped by Chappell, but Myners is sceptical: \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that Philip Green could be duped by anyone in a financial transaction. I\u2019ve learned that when dealing with Philip it\u2019s best to sup with a long spoon.\u201d At last week\u2019s hearings, Chappell was described by Michael Hitchcock, a former consultant to BHS, as a \u201cmythomaniac\u201d, a term describing someone with \u201cthe tendency to lie, exaggerate or relate incredible imaginary adventures as if they had really happened\u201d. So more The Secret Life of Walter Mitty than A Few Good Men. There was a further incredible plot twist as BHS\u2019s chief executive, Darren Topp, told the committee Chappell had threatened to kill him after he accused him of stealing money. \u201cHe basically said, \u2018It\u2019s my business, I can do what I want. If you kick off about it I\u2019m going to come down there and kill you...\u2019 He says he was in the helicopter squad of the SAS and I know he has got a gun.\u201d The idea that Chappell\u2019s unsuitability as a custodian of BHS was lost on as shrewd a character as Green is one of the main areas MPs are grappling with. But so far the postmortem has been a circular firing squad. Frank Field, chairman of the work and pensions committee, said it was trying to establish whether Green had helped present a picture of Chappell as a credible buyer after it emerged a short-term transfer of funds from a property group had bolstered his credentials. \u201cWe are following the money,\u201d explained Field, who has likened Green to \u201cBanquo\u2019s ghost\u201d hanging over BHS even under new ownership. \u201cWe will be asking [Green]: \u2018Have you asset stripped this company and destroyed 11,000 jobs and the proper payment of pensions to 22,000 pensioners?\u201d On Friday night, it emerged Green was threatening not to appear unless Field resigned. The businessman is understood to be working on a proposal that could resolve the pension crisis but earlier that day the MP told the Financial Times the committee would \u201claugh\u201d if he offered less than \u00a3600m to plug the pension fund. \u201cI am not prepared to participate in a process which has not even the pretence of fairness and objectivity and which has as its primary objective the destruction of my reputation,\u201d wrote Green in a letter to the Birkenhead MP. Green told the Observer he was \u201cundecided\u201d over whether to appear. Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley, tried to stay away from an inquiry into his business but relented after he was told that he risked \u201clengthy and public\u201d contempt hearings in parliament. Field was unmoved: \u201cThe House of Commons has asked me to chair and him to appear. I will chair and he will appear.\u201d Imagine if it were the bones of M&amp;S rather than BHS that were being picked over. It was Green\u2019s attempt to wrest control of the national treasure in 2004 that earned his acceptance by the establishment, with onlookers impressed by the blue-chip backing he had attracted. Green, aged 64, was born in Croydon but grew up in Hampstead Garden Suburb, an affluent area in north London. He was sent to a Jewish boarding school in Oxfordshire but left at 15 with no O-levels. His father, a small businessman, died when he was 12, and Green started working with his entrepreneurial mother, Alma, who owned a portfolio of garages and car showrooms. He acquired his cockney swagger while serving an apprenticeship in the rag trade, importing jeans from the far east and opening a designer discount store in London. His first significant deal came in 1985 when he acquired Jean Jeanie, a struggling jeans business, for \u00a365,000. Within a year, he had sold it for several million. He went on to run Amber Day, a discount clothes store quoted on the Stock Exchange, but didn\u2019t fit into the corporate world. He was forced out by shareholders in 1992 and retreated to the private arena. One person who knows Green says his best qualities are \u201ca great sense of humour\u201d and \u201cvery loving family\u201d. The couple have three children \u2013 a stepson, Brett Palos, from Tina\u2019s first marriage plus Chloe and Brandon. Green\u2019s acquaintance adds: \u201cPhilip has no spiritual or cultural side. He\u2019s not interested in arts, music or theatre. He\u2019s not well read and is non-active Jewish.\u201d Few of the great and good who have attended Green\u2019s famous birthday extravaganzas have stuck their neck out as the BHS saga unfolds. But they are now being pulled into the net of the inquiry, with Michael Sherwood, a senior Goldman Sachs banker and confidant, and the restauranteur Richard Caring, who owns the Ivy and was one of the original investors in BHS, now called as witnesses. Being knighted showed establishment approval for what Green felt he had achieved. \u201cStripping Green of his knighthood would for Lady Green be the most painful of all punishments, but it would be vindictive and inappropriate,\u201d says Myners. \u201cHe is entitled to have his arguments heard and dealt with in the same way we would respond if the person concerned was a simple Mr Green.\u201d \u2022 Comments will be opened later today THE GREEN FILE Born Croydon, 15 March 1952 Best of times Receiving a knighthood from the Tony Blair government for services to retail, sealing his membership of the business elite in 2006. \u201cI think it is a nice honour \u2013 to have made your mark,\u201d said Green at the time. Worst of times The collapse of BHS into administration has recast his public persona: no longer the \u201cking of the high street\u201d, he has been labelled the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. Having previously been celebrated for his business skills, the hundreds of millions of pounds his family banked from BHS are now being contrasted with the company\u2019s failure and the gaping hole in its pension scheme. What he says \u201cI was working as hard as I could and all these people beat me up. And you have all these people who can\u2019t even spell business or retail saying, \u2018Oh, we don\u2019t want people like him.\u2019 Snooty tooty people.\u201d What others say \u201cThe volcanoes erupt frequently. He\u2019s very sensitive but I think that for all people like Philip, insecurity is a factor, because in their minds they have got to continue to be successful\u2026There\u2019s a very childish side to Philip that looks for affection.\u201d Ian Grabiner, chief executive of Arcadia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
