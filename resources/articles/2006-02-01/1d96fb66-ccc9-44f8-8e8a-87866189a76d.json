There was a time - around 130 years ago I guess - when painters such as Vincent van Gogh would wander the streets unrepresented by commercial agents and PR people, and as a result their work would stand or fall on its artistic merit. Today most artists prefer to attach a manifesto, an attitude or a marketing ploy to their art, and we are asked to digest this as a part of our overall appreciation of their labours. One such artist, a conceptualist called Tino Sehgal, has hit on an idea that seems to have particular resonance for the PR industry. His exhibition is unusual: there are no pictures on the wall. There is not even a collection of bricks on the floor. Visitors to his current show at the ICA (declaration of interest - I am a member of the ICA council) are greeted by a small child who takes you into a series of experiences based around human contact. The artist has also decreed to the ICA curators that no physical objects should be used in the marketing of the show. There is no press release, pack of press cuttings or photography available to journalists who ask about what's happening at the ICA. So this leaves the PR department with a challenge. How exactly are you supposed to whip up the hype for the show when you can't write a press release or send out invitations to a launch event? I like this concept because it forces us to consider our core function as PR people. Most of the major PR agencies in the UK construct their business around writing strategies, drawing up Q&amp;As, drafting positioning statements, scripting advertorials, collating briefing packs, printing press kits and countless other bits of waffle that underpin our daily trade. This rationalising process gets charged to the clients, who in most cases seem happy to pay for it as they have been told that these are necessary building blocks in the construction of the great PR event. Get rid of all this stuff and you would demolish half the industry at a single sweep. All those miserable pen pushers down at HQ who are kept busy filling out evaluation forms all day? They'd be out the door. And the trends analysis team who sit stroking their chins and flicking through fashion magazines? Well, sorry, but they're toast too. If you were to reduce the role of the PR consultant to its most basic function what do you have? The man or woman on the phone whose job is simply to offer a description of their client's product in a topical, creative and engaging way. It's a horrible truth that the more you work for major brand clients, the more likely you are to be dragged away from this pure and poetic form of public relations and sucked into an awful machine that denies spontaneous thought and starts the process of immediate corruption of intent. To be a great publicist you must start by thinking as a journalist. This means creating stories, working to deadlines, moving quickly through the trees of the jungle, engaging people by being interesting, and, most unfashionably, having a mind that likes to question what is put in front of you. The only reason I mention this now is because as we progress into the digital age our industry needs to be clear about its function and identity. Over recent years, several public relations agencies have attempted to legitimise their existence and increase their perceived importance by talking grandly about their role in creating a difference with the consumer. But it's often the case that the resulting work simply fails to live up to these claims. It is agreed that great PR has the power to be the most powerful motivating force within the marketeer's portfolio. But it needs to be founded on the exchange of ideas, opinions and arguments between the PR person and the journalist. This area of human contact becomes even more vital when you consider the huge increase in hours spent absorbing data and entertainment from TVs and computers each day. PR people who don't regularly talk to journalists should go and work in advertising. It's that simple. Selling a story to a sceptical hack is important because it forces you to be exposed to the realities of the world. And any PR agency without this at the heart of their culture will quickly lose touch. Their only route to survival will be to employ a team of media streetfighters who know how to haggle with the man from the Sun or the editor of a glossy magazine. Let me end with a constructive suggestion. Why doesn't the PRCA, the trade body of PR industry, ask one of the PR people who has to promote Tino Sehgal's exhibition at the ICA, to talk to its senior members about his concept of constructive situations? It would help to remind the industry that the art of good PR is rooted in the ability to inspire through personal contact, and not through pages of scripted corporate gobbledegook. \u00b7 Julian Henry is a director of Henry's House PR consultancy.
