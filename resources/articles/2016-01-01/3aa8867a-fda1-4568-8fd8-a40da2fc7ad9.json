But that is just the visible tip of a story far from finished. It might have taken the world No47 only an hour and 19 minutes to dismiss the oldest player in the women\u2019s draw on a warm afternoon \u2013 and there could be no downplaying the emphatic 6-4, 6-2 scoreline \u2013 but hers was a triumph fashioned in midwinter, on cold, wet London nights when she was reduced to tears on the practice court through the grinding effort of repeated drills, yet begging for more hard yards to refine her excellent tennis. Her prize is a much easier assignment on Thursday against China\u2019s Saisai Zheng, who played way above her world ranking of 83 to demolish the German world No62, Carina Witthoeft, 6-1, 6-2 in an hour and a quarter. It will not be a respite, more a return to normality, and Konta should win again. \u201cI actually played her a few years ago at French Open qualifiers,\u201d said Zheng. \u201cThat was a long time ago. Last year in Wuhan she played really well. So I think she will be really tough opponent.\u201d If Konta needed a further lifting of the spirit the No2 seed, Simona Halep fell later to the Chinese qualifier Shuai Zhang, who registered her first grand slam win in 15 attempts. So, the fairway for Konta is wide, with few bunkers and only self-made hazards. She did not arrive here by accident. Her precision, her determination to \u201cstay in the moment\u201d was glaringly at odds with the distracted resignation of her garlanded opponent. Konta deserved to win because Williams was powerless to stop her and, ultimately, she looked drained of desire. As the British No1 recalled: \u201cDuring my pre-season, after day two I was just tired every single day. It didn\u2019t matter what we were doing. Even if I had a day off I was so tired. It takes a lot out of you. And, after you\u2019ve put so much work in, then it is about finding your feet again out on the match court. \u201cIt\u2019s a different ball game all together. The biggest thing that the pre-season does for you is to maximise your chance of playing a full season, of putting yourself in such a physical condition that you\u2019re able to rely on that during some very difficult conditions in matches. \u201c I don\u2019t actually hate anything about training \u2013 I\u2019m complaining about it, but in a good-hearted way; I thank my lucky stars that I get to train hard as a job. But it\u2019s not nice in the moment and, trust me, there are tears, because when I get tired I usually cry. But you learn to love it. One of my previous coaches used to talk about getting comfortable with being uncomfortable, and that\u2019s very true. \u201cIn every aspect of this sport you get thrown into some very uncomfortable situations that are about letting go and feeling at home. In week four of the off-season we were doing interval training on court and my tolerance was head height and my mood was about ceiling height. I had a moment, a bit of a breakdown, so my coach said: \u2018OK, we\u2019ll only do 15 seconds.\u2019 But I was, like: \u2018No! We keep it at 30 seconds \u2013 I\u2019m not crying for you to make this easier, I just need to let this out!\u2019\u201d And so 12,000 miles away in the first slam of the season she found herself looking across the net at Williams, who has won seven grand slams, who reached the final here 13 years ago, who had fought back from illness to return to the top 10 for the first time in five years and who still represented a genuine threat. \u201cThis was definitely the biggest stage I\u2019ve won on, as it was on Rod Laver. In terms of a decorated tennis player and the biggest champion I\u2019ve ever played, yeah, she definitely is. And I\u2019m very proud of the way I was able to stay very present and just keep going, whatever the scoreline.\u201d The match was not without its anxious moments, particularly when Williams broke trailing 0-5 in the second and started to build a little comeback energy. But staying \u201cvery present\u201d, as Konta puts it, has been the defining change in her tennis over the past year or so. \u201cWhen the ebbs and flows of matches go like that, it\u2019s very important to put things in perspective, to be very honest with yourself and say: \u2018Listen, if it does go 5-5 will the world implode? Not exactly.\u2019 \u201cWhile our emotions are running high and there is obviously a lot of adrenalin and things can get a bit tense, it is just a tennis match. Also, you have to realise she played very well [in the second set]. She made very few errors in those two games and was serving incredibly well to hold at 5-1.\u201d But clearly not well enough. There was a gulf that was visible to everyone on the tournament\u2019s main court. Those who might not have been familiar with Konta or her journey (even though she was born in Sydney) surely were aware they were witnessing the dismantling of a once-great player, the oldest in the tournament but still a Williams sister. For much of the match, it was one-sided. It would be illuminating to hear what the loser thought of the experience, perhaps what she thought of Konta\u2019s game and her prospects over the rest of the fortnight. But the American, who can be stubbornly aloof when the mood takes her, refused to come to the mandatory press conference and indicated she was happy to accept the fine. The maximum penalty for her recalcitrance is $20,000 but her fine is more likely to be closer to the $3,000 she incurred for a similar offence at Roland Garros last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
