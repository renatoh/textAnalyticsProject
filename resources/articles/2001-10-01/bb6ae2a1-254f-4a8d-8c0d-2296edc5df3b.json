Houllier suffered an acute dissection of the aorta at half-time during Saturday's Premiership draw with Leeds United. Having undergone surgery through the night he regained consciousness yesterday and, while unable to communicate, is apparently aware of what is happening around him. \"It's very good news,\" said the Liverpool assistant manager Phil Thompson. \"He's come off the ventilator and continues to improve. The surgeons will see how he reacts but they're well pleased. \"It put a good smile on everybody's face this morning and has given the whole squad a timely lift. I'd love the players to be 100% on the game but I'm not daft. They are concerned at G\u00e9rard's state of health and asking about him all the time.\" Houllier's wife Isabelle, brother Serge and his two sons were at his bedside yesterday. Staff at the Broadgreen cardiothoracic centre reiterated that the 54-year-old had not suffered a heart attack and that his heart was, in fact, in \"excellent condition\". \"It's frightening, really,\" said the club captain Jamie Redknapp. \"The gaffer has been a very positive man who lives for football. To see him in hospital is upsetting and all our thoughts are with his family. The Champions League was always his goal, so we have to make sure we put on a good show for him.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
