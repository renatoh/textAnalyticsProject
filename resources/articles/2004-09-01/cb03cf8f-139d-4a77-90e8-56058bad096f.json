Plots of land the size of handkerchiefs, crumpled into the nowhere lands of the Thames Gateway, the M11 corridor and greater Milton Keynes. Hundreds of thousands of new homes: red-tiled, UPVC-windowed, developers' junk. That is what many of us fear when we think of future housing. An England made more subtopian than suburban. A Britain divided between overcrowding and underachieving. Every last corner of a southern English field that once was forever cornflowers, dog rose and meadowsweet now built on in the most meretricious, money-wringing manner. Ever more cul-de-sac housing estates linked together by raging arterial roads lined with chain stores - with a bit of swooping-roofed architectural fantasia sculpted in between. Breeze-block homes - or \"consumption units\" as they will be known by 2020 - with twin garages for two Jags, or a brace of Jeeps. Petrol-powered still, despite the insoluble problems of the Middle East. Superstores. Multiplexes. Distribution depots. An England 100% England free. A getting- and-spending, logoed and baseball-capped land, chock-full of call centres and staffed by customer service facility managers. An England stripped of public-minded public services and punished by even more CCTV cameras, by congestion charges, creativity charges, intelligence charges. An England where no one will remember Adlestrop, much less Grantchester or Little Gidding. A nation of mass housing with as much poetry as the infinite sub-clauses of a particularly turgid and much-delayed government report. A land stupefyingly bland and irredeemably boring. A country offering good old English staples: cappuccinos, quarter-pounders, barbecued ribs and deep-pan pizzas, all you can eat at every bloated turn, every blubbery day. A self-righteous, increasingly foul-mannered nation valuing \"accessibility\", \"inclusivity\", \"sustainability\" and rights rather than duties. A country of shopaholic, drunken, TV-eyed excess, signifying not very much at all. Depressing? Yes, and this is the indolent world we are in danger of creating, while governments, quangos and worthy professional bodies bang on about shaping \"sustainable communities\", their idea for the New Urbanism of the future. But this glum, dystopian world is already with us. It has been, in one form or another, since the 1920s: only its rate of expansion and the places it is colonising are changing. Along the once silver-fringed and bird-haunted marshes of Thamesside Essex are new estates of witless housing, which have been approved - as blustering signposts at Barking Reach boast - by Whitehall. They are so dismal, strung out under high-voltage electricity cables, scented by sewer works and scored by roaring dual-carriageways, that anyone with a choice - something we are all meant to be endowed with in New Britain - would surely opt for a caravan, a tree-house or a lean-to. How can the country - how can London, which once boasted some of the best respected low-cost and middle-class housing in the world - have stooped so very low? Architectural students from around the world now come to gawp at and video the staggeringly inept new world we are creating with which to punish our citizens. By 2020, those who have not been imprisoned for increasingly petty offences to satisfy the baying of moral cretins will, increasingly, live in jails of their own buying, if not making. Or will they? Is there a chance that we might yet use our architectural and design talent, latent though it might be, to shape a very different Britain? Could our housing enjoy a renaissance between now and 2020? Cynics and fatalists will shrug their shoulders and argue that what will be will be: London and the south-east will metamorphose into one amorphous economic hothouse, one big dormitory suburb, a snook to cock at continental Europeans with their elitist, un-American obsession with compact, cultured cities. Sod them for a game of urban warriors. The towns and cities north of the Humber-Severn divide, these cynics argue, will shed their residents like a moulting dog, leaving their centres top-heavy with \"iconic\" City of Culture-style architectural follies, heaving nightclubs, drunken ravers, ailing PFI hospitals and graffiti-sprayed public art in pedestrian precincts. Thankfully, there are alternatives, and we are not too late to build them. Housing does not need to be so vapidly dull, nor so very cynical. If we are honest with ourselves, we might learn to admit that neither suburban sprawl nor stock suburban housing is for all of us. Planning authorities, housebuilders and architects should be able to respond more fluidly, and fluently, to people's dreams. Admittedly, by 2020 we are unlikely to be able to buy the sort of houses evoked in JG Ballard's Vermilion Sands - the very structures of which mutate according to the emotions of those who live, or once lived in them - but we might be able to buy, and even build for ourselves, homes that have more meaning and life than mass-produced, brick-dressed breezeblock boxes. To enable that to happen, planners and those who draw up the planning laws need to think hard, and laterally. If we are going to house people on floodplains, as we are doing in the Thames Gateway, we might offer them houses on stilts, or boat houses - or just boats. The house types already under construction in the area are the architectural equivalent of King Canute ordering back the waves, except Canute did it to prove that even a king had no power over the gods of nature. Contemporary housebuilders appear to believe they have gone one better. High waters, though, will come to the Thames Gateway as surely as they did over Canute's knees, and to ancient Mesopotamia, as recounted in Genesis. Noah built his ark, and survived the flood. We would be wise to follow the mythical example of Noah and assume the waters will come. Or we might choose to build houses that soar above future floodwaters and that, instead of gobbling up land, use as little of it as possible. On pages 16 and 17 we show the ideas for Skyhouse by Marks Barfield, architects of the London Eye. Skyhouse, as Marks Barfield is keen to stress, is not a proposal for a new generation of tower blocks, structures now largely discredited. It is, rather, a kind of giant artificial stem off which grow flats, houses, shops, health clubs and gardens. Powered by recyclable solar and wind energy sources, Skyhouses could provide clusters of ultra-modern homes, offering peerless views without destroying the land from which they rise. They would, in all likelihood, be popular with the young, those without dogs and children, and those happily retired from the Ricky Gervais-style office, customer service facility and chain store world below them. Equally, we might want to build new land, reclaimed from the water, as the Dutch have done with their polder for generations. Or we could build lightweight cabins, or the equivalent of Mr and Mrs Peggotty's boat, on soil unsuitable for conventional homes. We could add cabins along old lanes, flanked by allotments, instead of thumping down executive estates and their dream-shattering houses. But there is a tremendously strong vein of snobbery running through planning departments the length and breadth of Britain. Conventional housing schemes designed in garish, pseudo-vernacular styles - meaning they look the same wherever you go - are given the go-ahead pretty much willy nilly, because they look like the proper homes depicted in children's drawings, even if they undermine the character of the villages they desecrate and make a mockery of centuries of local architectural styles, and run counter to an area's building character and materials. Yet when people try to build truly local homes that would blend in to their surroundings, or add to the character of a locale, they are usually told by their local planning departments that they cannot do so. But think of the startling places of Britain, and consider for a moment the fact that their attraction is owed to what sets them apart from a thousand other places. Then think of how their characters could be destroyed in weeks. Imagine, for example, if Dungeness in the far south-east corner of Kent was to be rebuilt with contemporary, pseudo-vernacular developers' housing. No more black-tarred fishermen's cottages. No more railway-carriage homes. There would be no particular reason to live here. It would be just like anywhere else. It is an irony that Dungeness, a very special place, has been saved by a product of the modern world less attractive to most than even the boxiest of starter homes. It has avoided the fate of much of the rest of Romney Marsh, which once seemed safe from crass housing developments, not so much by its remote, end-of-the-world location on a shingle beach looking across a rough stretch of sea, but because there is a nuclear power station there. Most people want cheap(ish) electricity on demand, but few want to face up to the reality of the nuclear power that helps to provide it. Just a few miles from Dungeness is St Mary-in-the-Marsh; the ancient parish church celebrated by artists for centuries is now faced by a singularly unsuitable row of pseudo-vernacular-style executive houses. That is a dumb piece of building work, but it has been replicated throughout the country. The character of charming old villages throughout Oxfordshire - a county of home workers sitting behind computer screens, SUV in the yard - is being undermined as fast as I can type this by mind- numbingly banal new housing. This same housing can be seen from the windows of any number of garishly painted, privatised trains. Swindon, for example, once the proud home of the Great Western Railways locomotive works, is swamped with the stuff, wilfully badly planned and designed to numb brains. Ely, all of a sudden, is even worse. Didcot, a disaster. This new, ever-extending subtopia is not a patch on Bekonscot Model Village in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. Bekonscot was built in 1929 as an idyllic vision of a contemporary Britain. But it was a dream even then: three-quarters of a century ago, critics were aiming the same criticism at crass new housing developments as we hear today. There were solutions then, as there are now, but clearly the idea of extending the sub-Metroland style of housing and living throughout the country has been, and may yet remain, unstoppable. There is no reason to doubt that in 2020 we will still be building this kind of poorly planned, pokey, two-fingers-up-at-local-character housing, and it will still be marketed in the property pages as some sort of domestic dream. Over the past decade we have seen a rise in the number of new \"apartments\" and \"lofts\", converted from old warehouses, in revitalised city centres, but these are only a small part of the housing market and they will remain so, as will some of the fascinating and even romantic designs by many architects trying to inject fresh ideas into housing. We could, of course, build more on what are known as brownfield sites on former industrial land, especially in any number of the all but forgotten corners of London and its inner suburbs. Why build on virgin land when we have great patches of the London borough of Brent, for example, to build on? And many other inner suburbs in need of upgrading and general redevelopment. The reason we rape so many virgin sites with crude housing is that there is still cheap land to buy. It is much easier, and more profitable, to build cheap, conventional houses for sale on greenfield sites rather than to clear redundant city sites and design intelligent architecture. It is certainly easier to sell those houses than to convince buyers they need not be sceptical about an elegant flat, perhaps with a balcony and a roof garden, or maybe looking over a courtyard or a town square garden. Instead the shoddy little house is sold as a dream, yet it is nothing of the sort, out in the wind-scythed Thames Gateway, where public transport will never be as good or as well connected as it is further into central London. Beyond the question of cheap virgin land versus more expensive used land, we need to think about what our inner suburbs might be like in 2020 if current trends prevail. To ensure they are truly attractive places to build and live, we need to make sure they retain some of their essential and distinctive services - post offices, family-owned shops, libraries, street markets, swimming pools. All those things, however, are in danger of being swept away by dull-minded corporations, which appear to despise the very people they are meant to serve (as in the case of the Post Office), or else by the chain stores pressing hard on the frontiers of even the most special of our old inner suburbs. Who would want to work so very hard and save enough money to buy a home in an area meant to be special, but which ends up - certainly by 2020 - almost 100% free of independent shops and cafes and pretty much 100% full of boring chain stores? The trouble is that there is no grown-up - much less joined-up - thinking in local or national government, much less in planning offices, to prevent the destruction of the distinctive nature of our high streets and suburban centres. Policy in general is aimed at undermining local character, and small family businesses; it encourages powerful national and global business interests better able to pay high taxes. Property is simply too expensive for anyone's long-term good or happiness in Britain. That is unlikely to change by 2020. And yet there is so much talk of \"urban regeneration\", of government quangos working with the best architects, with a desire, however superficial, to raise the standards of housing design and improve the ways we live. That, though, is so much hot air, because the economy does not need to follow such high-flown ideas to keep functioning. It needs only to perform its task at the most prosaic level. By 2020, then, more and more people will live in execrably dull new homes, in increasingly characterless extended suburbs lined with chain stores. Such homes will be described by ministers of parties right and right (there will be no \"left\" or even \"centre\" by then) as \"cutting-edge designs\" in \"sustainable communities\". They will claim to have \"delivered\" (ministers, it seems, would care to be regarded like the milkmen of yore) the half-million new homes, or whatever the figure will be by then, that the south-east of England so badly needs, while palming off northerners with some cultural festivals, more nightclubs, fancy department stores and bread-and-circus architecture. But, what if ... what if we revolted against this trash, this \"delivery\" hype, this wilful blandness, and went for what, in our hearts, and even in our minds' eyes, we might be really happy with, and delighted by? Houses with local character, whether cobbled together from rags and patches or the very latest in leading-edge design. Suburbs revitalised, and given form, with new homes built around squares, along canals, with communal as well as private gardens, shot through with covered markets, street markets, libraries (instead of dumbed-down Idea Stores), served by intelligent public transport services run, not by some bullying, punitive, power-hungry mayor, but by a new, forward-looking public corporation with the aim of providing the very best to ordinary people. On the skyline, there may well be some of Marks Barfield's elegant Skyhouses. Down on the Romney Marshes, or in the byways of Cambridgeshire, there will be cabins - some clapboard, some made of ultra-modern materials - tucked in between hollyhocked hedgerows, choired by songbirds, replacing crass pseudo-vernacular housing estates. Ely and Swindon, Didcot and Doncaster will gang together to demolish trash cul-de-sac housing, and rediscover both their local identities and their place in the world in the third decade of the 21st century. In towns, new housing, whether truly traditional or super-new, will be squeezed into any number of unlikely sites, so people can live cheek-by-jowl with their history as well in the present, while looking to the future. The Thames Gateway will be given back to marshes and fowls, with those who truly choose to live here investing in houses on stilts and houseboats. Independent shops and cafes will be encouraged by planning and local taxation laws; chains will be curbed in their ambition to turn us into a nation of all-consuming dullards. We will learn to stop \"delivering housing\" and to design decent homes and rewarding places to live. In 2020. Maybe.
