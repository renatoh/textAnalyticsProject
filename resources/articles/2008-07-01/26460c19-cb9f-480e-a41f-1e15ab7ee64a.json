But since his is one of the best contemporary small groups on the planet, it is not hard to see why he is happy to stick with it. The group played its only UK gig this week, with British pianist Andrew McCormack's punchy trio opening the show. The pianist's dense improvising ignited his sometimes diffuse themes - but it was an initially spiky and wayward and then urgently swinging account of West Side Story's Something's Coming that brought the set to the boil. Student drummer James Maddren deputised in the trio at a few hours' notice, and confirmed, not for the first time, that he is a UK percussion star on the rise. Branford Marsalis's own drummer Jeff \"Tain\" Watts and pianist Joey Calderazzo are major reasons why his group is able to sustain and vary its intense collective drive. Marsalis lets improvisation run, so the furious ensemble energy borders on the transcendental, but occasionally generates more heat than light. Marsalis could have edited one or two of the longer jams, but his freewheeling tenor solo on The Return of the Jitney and Thelonious Monk's Rhythm-a-Ning testified to his robust jazz spirit. A graceful, full-toned Eric Revis solo bass feature, and a stream of stunning piano solos - from baroque to freebop - from Calderazzo, were also among the most incandescent moments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
