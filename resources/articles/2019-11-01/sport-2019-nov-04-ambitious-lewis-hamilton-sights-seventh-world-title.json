Luckily Wolff did elaborate. \u201cIt\u2019s where talent meets a big push for self-improvement all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat combination makes him stand out in his generation. He will always say there is room for improvement and I think this is the mentality you need to have.\u201d It is why Hamilton\u2019s hunger for success is still nowhere near sated, even after passing Juan Manuel Fangio to become second in the all-time rankings, one shy of Michael Schumacher\u2019s seven titles. Hamilton will celebrate his 35th birthday in January, then set his sights on matching the German\u2019s record, convinced his skills are yet to peak. He sounded restless and relentless on Sunday only an hour or so after his triumph at the Circuit of the Americas, where second in the United States Grand Prix behind his teammate, Valtteri Bottas, was enough to seal a fifth title in six years with two races to spare. Hamilton talked about the need to enjoy the moment but he also said that \u201cfrom the outside things always look great but it\u2019s not always the case. And I am also struggling with lots of different things and battling certain demons.\u201d He was reluctant to elaborate other than to say that everyone has to wrestle with personal challenges in everyday life; negative thoughts and events that demand a positive outlook in response if they are to be overcome. Certainly the death of the Mercedes adviser and mentor Niki Lauda in May cast a shadow over the season. Hamilton also referenced the death of Anthoine Hubert, the 22-year-old Formula Two driver killed in a crash at Spa-Francorchamps in August. \u201cI saw it on the TV, I saw it happen,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cThat again, when something like that happens, it can put lots of doubts in your mind and batting that off and thinking \u2018OK, jeez, is it time to stop or shall I keep going because there\u2019s lots of life afterwards?\u2019 I still want to spend time with my family, I still want to have a family one day, all these different things, but I\u2019m so charged to do and I love doing what I do so much that I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot that can particularly stop me in that sense.\u201d Bottas\u2019s impressive drive from pole to win his fourth race of the year \u2013 the best season\u2019s haul of his seven-year F1 career \u2013 suggests that, if the 30-year-old Finn continues to improve, he may push Hamilton closer next season (Bottas is second in the standings, 67 points adrift of Hamilton). Ferrari may have something to say about that, provided they can conquer reliability problems and cut out the errors that have pockmarked their campaign. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the quickest package for a long time but we were able to make the least mistakes on Sunday and that was probably the biggest key of making us win the championship,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cThere is a reason why the Schumacher record stands, because it\u2019s just very difficult.\u201d Still, it would be no surprise if Hamilton made it four in a row in 2020 and Wolff added: \u201cIf we are able to provide our drivers with a good car next year that is competitive, we continue to work on the gaps we still have, try to minimise mistakes, and Lewis has a good season, I think there is no reason why he couldn\u2019t go for a seventh title.\u201d Before that 2019 concludes with races in Brazil and Abu Dhabi. \u201cUsually the reflection comes at the end of the year, when work finishes and you can just take a load off and just sit back and have a beer,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI will be with my dogs, with my feet up and just only then can you have a moment to grasp how great a year it has been. \u201cIn my mind I\u2019m just too competitive, so I\u2019m thinking: \u2018OK, we\u2019ve got two more races to go. How am I going to do a better job?\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
