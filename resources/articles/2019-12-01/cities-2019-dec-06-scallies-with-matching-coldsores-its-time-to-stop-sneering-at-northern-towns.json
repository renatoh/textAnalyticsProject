It's time to stop sneering at northern towns", "bodyText": "Maybe the driving northern rain has washed away our sense of humour. Jack Hurley\u2019s \u201cRubbish Seaside\u201d, a collection of quasi-satirical railway posters, has been billed a \u201cbackhanded love letter\u201d. To our eyes, as teachers who work with some of the country\u2019s most disadvantaged young people, it\u2019s \u201cbackhanded\u201d in much the same way that an emotionally abusive boyfriend calls you fat, but it\u2019s you who can\u2019t take a joke. The series did feature some nuanced and humorous social criticism. Hurley\u2019s depiction of Manchester thoughtfully contrasted the gold-plated skyline with street-level poverty. However, his treatment of towns such as Blackpool betrayed a regrettable lack of creativity and empathy. In a local authority that has the worst public health demographics in the UK \u2013 due to savage cuts from Westminster \u2013 it seems puerile to poke fun at the \u201cmatching coldsores\u201d sported by the \u201csmall army of scallies\u201d Hurley sneeringly refers to in his note on the piece. Every good comedian knows the rule about punching up rather than down. Maybe an educative trip to Blackpool\u2019s Comedy Carpet is in order. You don\u2019t get away with it by being from \u201cthe north\u201d either. It\u2019s not a lumpen mass; you wouldn\u2019t allow someone from Chelsea to speak on behalf of a council estate in Tower Hamlets, so why conflate Southport and Scarborough? Depictions like Hurley\u2019s are also mediated through \u2013 and consumed by \u2013 a predominantly southern, middle-class gaze. These posters were promoted in a \u201cfun new art exhibition\u201d in Gray\u2019s Inn Square (\u201cPlease do pop in, browse and purchase!\u201d). Funnily enough, we\u2019ve yet to see them displayed in all their glory on the railings of Blackpool\u2019s North Pier. In 1981, the Tory minister Norman Tebbit notoriously regaled the Conservative Party conference \u2013 in Blackpool\u2019s Winter Gardens \u2013 with the fable of his jobless father, who \u201cgot on his bike and looked for work, and kept looking till he found it\u201d. Forty years on, northern towns are still facing the same stigmatising blame-game. The toxic treadmill of social mobility is exposed when middle class \u201cescapees\u201d from poorer post-industrial and coastal towns think they have a free pass to guffaw at those forgotten by a fraudulent meritocracy. In 2017, Justine Greening, then the secretary of state for education, recalled with woe her childhood in Rotherham: \u201cI was aiming for something better \u2026 I knew there was something better out there\u201d. It\u2019s as if her Yorkshire hometown were a remote planet necessitating extraterrestrial journeys to discover intelligent life. Unless the goal of social mobility is that we all eventually move to London, we need to start taking northern towns and their potential seriously. Rather than encouraging talented young people to leave and take their ideas with them, we ought to invest in entire communities. If moving out is the only way of moving up, something\u2019s not working. And it\u2019s not just Norman Tebbit\u2019s dad. We have both taught extensively in schools in Blackpool and elsewhere. We know that children are quick to internalise disparaging media portrayals of their home towns. Their self esteem is inextricably linked to low self-worth at community level. We see this when they describe their towns as dirty and dangerous, and when they use \u201ccouncil house\u201d as a slur. The constant media battering fosters shame and hopelessness; they can\u2019t see a secure and fulfilling future close to home. These kids are told they lack aspiration, but also that there is nothing worthwhile to aspire to where they live. It pits them against their families and neighbourhoods. They can\u2019t win. For every shoddy stereotype in the press, we see a missed opportunity to report on the creativity kindled in response to just these lazy tropes. You might have seen, for example, the divisive Panorama documentary in which Blackburn was publicly shamed as \u201csegregated\u201d (or read the Guardian\u2019s four-star review). Blackburn Museum responded with Kick Down the Barriers, a project collaborating with artists and writers to rewrite this toxic narrative. Particularly exciting is an upcoming piece by Jamie Holman and Sana Maulvi, which takes the form of a series of letters to one another exploring the development of their friendship over the years, and reflecting on the stereotypes and cliches they remember along the way. Have you heard of it? No? The north keeps kicking. Blackpool arts programme Leftcoast commissioned Left Behind, a series of works produced in response to a miserable Financial Times article of the same name. The Manchester-based youth leadership enterprise Reclaim celebrates the diversity of the modern British working class. Hurley\u2019s contribution only serves to perpetuate the feeling that locals need to be embarrassed about their hometowns. Surely there are more deserving targets of his satirical aptitude. Communities will always find strength from within when they are let down by those in power. Media outlets, especially those claiming liberal credentials, have a responsibility to amplify these voices. Rebecca Grant started her teaching career in Blackpool. She currently working on a PhD about educational disadvantage in Manchester, writing for Kick Down the Barriers in Blackburn and continues to teach in secondary schools. Charlotte Yates has worked in a number of roles in education and currently teaches English in a state secondary in the North West of England.
