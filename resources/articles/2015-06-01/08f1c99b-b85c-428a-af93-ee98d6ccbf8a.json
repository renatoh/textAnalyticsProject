The left-back will compete with Kieran Gibbs for a place in Roy Hodgson\u2019s team in Sunday\u2019s friendly against the Republic of Ireland and the Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia a week later, having broken back into the setup for the draw in Italy in March. Bertrand played 39 times for Southampton over the campaign, making his initial loan move a permanent \u00a310m deal mid-season, having endured a nomadic existence with Chelsea. The 25-year-old had nine loan spells with seven different clubs while on the books of the Premier League champions. Although he started the 2012 Champions League final, his debut in European competition, and played 38 games for Chelsea under Roberto Di Matteo and Rafael Ben\u00edtez over the subsequent season \u2013 gaining his first two caps in the process \u2013 his progress rather stalled upon Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s arrival back at Stamford Bridge, with the chance offered by Southampton too good to turn down. \u201cFor me it wasn\u2019t a case of \u2018my career isn\u2019t going right, I\u2019m not playing for Chelsea\u2019,\u201d said Bertrand, who made only one league appearance under the Portuguese in 2013 before departing to Aston Villa on loan. \u201cI know personally I should still be there and I should still be playing [for them]. \u201cI know that in myself. That\u2019s my inner confidence. It\u2019s nothing to do with my capabilities that I\u2019m not there, it\u2019s purely circumstance but it is no drama. That is football and these things happen. I\u2019m not trying to prove people wrong and I\u2019ve no grudges [with Mourinho], no chip on my shoulder. Football is football, business is business. \u201cI am fantastically happy at Southampton now, playing week in, week out, developing as a footballer and really enjoying life. I don\u2019t even look back and wish I\u2019d made the move sooner. Everyone has their own path and this is mine, and I\u2019m thankful for everything I learned in my years at Chelsea. I played with some fantastic players and under some world-class managers \u2013 10 or 11 of them \u2013 and drew aspects from each and every one. Each season at Chelsea I sensed progress, from playing 10 games to 16, 20 to 34 over a campaign. But the season when it didn\u2019t pan out the way I\u2019d hoped [2013-14] and I lost out on being with England, that made it clear I needed to find somewhere to play consistently.\u201d Bertrand\u2019s reward for excellent form at Southampton \u2013 aside from his recall to the England squad \u2013 was a place in the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association top-flight team of the year, alongside three former club-mates at Chelsea. \u201cI felt I\u2019d made progress this last season, that I\u2019d got to know myself more as a player,\u201d he said. \u201cThings come more naturally when you\u2019re not in-out, in-out. \u201cBefore, every time I was called into the team, it felt like an audition. But if you play more regularly, you get to that stage where you know your game and can make a proper impression, or perhaps try new things. Southampton gave me the platform to perform; the foundations I needed. \u201cBeing settled has been massive for me. You get to an age where you need that consistency, not only for yourself but for your family. Previously, every summer I would come back [and ask]: \u2018Am I going, am I staying?\u2019 But this has been about raising the levels of my game. I would play occasionally at Chelsea but now I feel part of it properly at Southampton. I feel like a footballer. When the team win and you are playing consistently, you feel good about it. You get a day off the next day and you feel like you deserved it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
