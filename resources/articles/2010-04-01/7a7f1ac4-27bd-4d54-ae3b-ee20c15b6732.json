And sweet and poetic their chosen names can indeed be. Coral Dawn, Mantanola, Seafoam, Dorandi, Red Planet, Dancing Butterfly all inspire some idea of truth and beauty ready to blossom. But how about nega9000, apintforme, waxy2, yepandthattoo, usini, si15, pokerdonkey and clunie? What do these \u2013 taken at random from an online discussion thread on Comment is free \u2013 suggest will be in store for us? Does it trivialise heavyweight, considered commentary by our leading writers? Is it the reason that threads can be marred by flaming and abuse? Of course, things have changed from the wild west days of the web. The Guardian uses moderation \u2013 a light touch monitoring of posts \u2013 to douse down the flames and eject trolls. Everyone who posts has to register with a real name and email address. That though can be easily faked \u2013 which is why some websites are using social network profiles such as Facebook to verify their commenters' identities. So why do posters continue with their online nicknames? The answer seems to be that a culture and etiquette was laid down in the early days of the internet, when nicknames were part conspiracy of the initiated, part an addiction to sword and sorcery games. Whatever, it became the default of the online community \u2013 and these are the users, the early adopters, who have driven online discussion, first on Usenet and later on news websites. So we often have completely different regimes. Be anybody you like online \u2013 but get real in print. On the Guardian letters page we require a full address and contact telephone number with each letter, and we ring correspondents whose letters we intend to use. We can never 100% guarantee that someone is who they say they are, but with potential cross-referencing on address, by telephone and email address, it would take a certain amount of determination to take on a false identity. And this kind of veracity seems to be what people demand. We receive complaints about using titles like professor \u2013 and about not using them; about how many women (guessed from the name) we publish and how many writers from London we have on the page; lobbyists for good causes want as many identifiable names as possible printed. Maybe it's a reflection of that old expression \"in cold print\", a greater sense of visibility that makes people demand real identities in their paper. Perhaps anonymous or pseudonymous letters carry intimations of slander or sly denunciations to some Stasi or other. So will increasing demands be made for real names in online user-generated content as the medium matures? It doesn't seem like it yet. In a survey of online readers last July, the Economist found fierce resistance: \"You strongly objected to compulsory use of real names \u2026 Some said they feel personally safe to use their own name, but worry for others' safety and care for the candour and liveliness that safety makes possible.\" \"Real names increase trust but hurt privacy,\" said one respondent. \"I'd rather put up with the occasional rudeness than with lack of encouragement for people to express their views freely,\" commented another. Of course safety and privacy can be a real issue \u2013 particularly to people living under oppressive regimes. On the letters page we allow anonymity where it involves risk to someone's personal safety or livelihood, or where the privacy of someone being written about might be breached. There seems no obvious reason in principle why that should be different online, and it may be that the \"privacy\" of people to make exaggerated and sometimes rancourous, if not abusive, comments keeps more people out of the discussion than it attracts in. But there remains the feasibility question. We receive between 200 and 300 letters (in fact, mostly emails) a day and print 15-20 of them. Any one of a couple of dozen articles a day on Comment is free could receive hundreds of postings. Verifying that lot would run up a pretty big phone bill. Until someone finds a way of automating that task (unlikely), our great minds are going to have to engage in good grace with the likes of captainblood and greendragonreprised."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
