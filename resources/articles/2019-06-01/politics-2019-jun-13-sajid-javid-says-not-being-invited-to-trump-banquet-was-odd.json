Javid, who is standing to succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader, expressed frustration at the snub, describing it as \u201codd\u201d after more junior ministers were invited. He stopped short of claiming No 10 blocked his attendance because of his Muslim background, but the former Conservative party chair Sayeeda Warsi suggested it was an example of Islamophobia. Warsi, who has urged the party to launch a full independent inquiry into allegations of anti-Muslim prejudice, tweeted: \u201cTo use my own phrase from 2011, \u2018Islamophobia has passed the dinner table test\u2019.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said it was \u201ccategorically untrue\u201d to link the snub to Javid\u2019s Muslim background. \u201cThe prime minister is proud to have appointed Sajid Javid as the country\u2019s first Muslim home secretary,\u201d he said. Later, Warsi challenged her fellow Tory peer Howard Leigh, when he claimed the party had no prejudice against Javid. She tweeted that there had been numerous cases of party members and activists \u201ctargeting Sajid with anti-Muslim racism\u201d. In his first comments on the snub, Javid said he had written to the prime minister\u2019s office asking why he was not invited, and suggested he was unconvinced by the answer he was given. Asked by the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on Thursday why he thought he was not invited, Javid said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve asked but I haven\u2019t got a \u2026 I was just told that normally home secretaries aren\u2019t invited, so I don\u2019t know.\u201d Asked how he felt about not being asked to attend when other more junior members of the cabinet including Michael Gove and Penny Mordaunt were invited, Javid said: \u201cI don\u2019t like it. For the reason that you have just said. It is odd. \u201cMy office did ask No 10 and they said no. So you\u2019d have to ask someone from No 10 why they made that decision.\u201d Asked whether the snub was linked to his Muslim background, Javid said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not saying that at all. I really don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t got an \u2026 I\u2019ve just been told that normally an invite doesn\u2019t always go to a home secretary.\u201d Downing Street denied any malign intent, saying Javid was one of many ministers to have been disappointed. \u201cThis was a state banquet hosted by Her Majesty the Queen, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to discuss in public who did or did not ask to attend,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. \u201cBut as with any state banquet, only a limited number of places are available to the government. A large number of ministers who expressed a wish to attend were not able to do so.\u201d A Downing Street source said there was a \u201cfixed list\u201d of people who must attend state banquets, including the prime minister, chancellor and foreign secretary, and there were in total eight slots available for Trump. The source pointed out May, when home secretary at the time of Barack Obama\u2019s 2011 state visit, did not attend his banquet. Javid\u2019s predecessor as home secretary, Amber Rudd, was invited to at least one banquet for a head of state during her tenure. The Court Circular records she was a guest at the state banquet held in honour of the king of Spain in July 2017. The former home secretary Jacqui Smith said she was invited to every state banquet during her two years in the post. Javid was one of several British politicians who criticised Trump in 2017 when the US president retweeted videos from the far-right group Britain First. Javid, who was then communities secretary, accused Trump of endorsing the views of \u201ca vile, hate-filled racist organisation that hates me and people like me\u201d. He added: \u201cHe is wrong and I refuse to let it go and say nothing.\u201d Earlier this month, the Muslim Council of Britain wrote to Theresa May asking her if Javid was not invited to the state banquet with Trump because he was of Muslim heritage. The letter cited Trump\u2019s Muslim travel ban, his retweeting of posts from Britain First and his criticism of the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. \u201cWe are all aware of the Islamophobia that President Trump has propagated and tolerated at the highest levels of his administration, both in rhetoric and policy,\u201d the council said. A council spokesman said it had yet to receive a reply to the letter. \u201cIf it is confirmed that the prime minister acceded to a request by President Trump to exclude Sajid Javid because he thought he was Muslim, this would constitute Islamophobia at the highest levels of our government,\u201d he said. \u201cThis would add to the wealth of evidence that already demonstrates the need for an inquiry into Islamophobia.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
