Union officials fear that the banks could make more than 10,000 workers redundant within a matter of months of them joining forces unless they were forced to be more transparent about their plans. The warning came as ministers were put under further pressure to reconsider the terms imposed on banks as part of the government's rescue package, which restricts payments to shareholders. The UK Shareholders' Association, which represents small investors, said Treasury demands that banks pay 12% interest on government loans and hold back dividend payments until the loans were paid would hit investors hard. It said many pensioners who relied on dividend payments would suffer a significant cut in their retirement income. The group has campaigned against the HBOS merger with Lloyds TSB, arguing that the terms of the deal would result in huge losses for shareholders. Roger Lawson, chairman of the group, said: \"We suggest that the government needs to reconsider the terms applied to these recapitalisations and take a more enlightened view on why people invest in stocks and shares.\" He said most stockmarket investors were not \"out to make a fast buck from risky speculations\", but had invested for the long-term dividend income and growth of the company. \"If the government undermines this basic premise by rash interventions, then they undermine the whole capitalist economy and discourage the prudence shown by people in saving for their retirement via stockmarket investment.\" He appeared to be thrown a lifeline by the government's City minister, Lord Myners, who negotiated the bank rescue package. In an article in today's Guardian, he indicates the restrictions on the banks may be short-lived and a return to profits may follow sooner than expected. He said the \"decisive action\" by the government would maintain the UK as \"a world leader in financial services\". Myners said: \"The fundamentals that underpinned our successes over the last decade have not changed: a talented workforce, world-class infrastructure, and an internationalism and openness unmatched by other financial centres. These factors will put us on a stronger footing than ever in the newly shaped world of financial services.\" The government is expected to back the union of HBOS and Lloyds TSB despite shareholders' concerns and fears from consumer groups that the merged business will dominate the high street and work against the interests of consumers. Union complaints that the merged banks will seek mass redundancies as a quick route to profitability are also expected to fall on deaf ears at the Treasury. Officials from Accord, an independent union that represents HBOS employees, said they were not against the acquisition in principle but remain to be convinced that the proposed deal was in the medium- to long-term interests of HBOS employees, customers and communities if speculation of between 14,000 to 40,000 job cuts proved to be correct. As a result, the union has set out a 10-point plan that it wants the management of both HBOS and Lloyds TSB to support. Accord intends to have the 10 points included in the prospectus that must be issued by HBOS. If the management are supportive of the plans, the union may then encourage employees to support the proposed takeover. The 10 points include: a commitment to maintain employment in those parts of the UK where both banks currently have operations; a commitment from Lloyds not to outsource jobs to offshore call centres; and that pay, pensions and other employment terms are protected. Details about job cuts among the 140,000-strong combined staff have yet to be released but cost synergies of \u00a31bn have been promised by the management."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
