They understand their capacity to say no, and the importance of respecting a no when they hear it from others. They also know that certain parts of their body are private and that no one has the right to ask if they can see or touch them. In short, they already understand ideas of bodily autonomy, agency and consent. The value in giving kids the tools to negotiate and assert bodily boundaries from an early age is now widely acknowledged in academic and parenting literature. These skills are crucial for navigating healthy and safe relationships \u2013 including sexual relationships \u2013 later in life, and reducing the chances of experiencing, or perpetrating, sexual abuse and assaults. The recent revelation, then, that New South Wales police have been regularly strip-searching young people, including minors as young as 10, is horrifying. Many of these searches appear to have been conducted unlawfully, without the \u201cseriousness and urgency of the circumstances\u201d warranting them, and \u2013 in the case of minors \u2013 without a parent, guardian or independent adult present. Police have been forcing young people to not only remove all their clothes but also, in some cases, to lift up their breasts or genitals, bend over and separate buttocks, and/or squat and cough, sometimes over a mirror. Such searches, which are also being conducted by police in other jurisdictions around Australia, are likely to be producing significant short- and long-term trauma and should be discontinued immediately. Strip-searches are a form of state-sanctioned violence that, as a recent report suggests, constitute \u201can inherently humiliating and degrading violation of a person\u2019s right to bodily integrity\u201d. It is also widely recognised that they can be experienced as a form of sexual assault and can re-traumatise those with past experiences of abuse or sexual assault. And for young trans and gender diverse people, the additional trauma associated with being forced to strip naked in front of strangers would be significant. In my own research looking at the broad impacts of drug detection dog operations at music festivals and events, interview participants viscerally reported their experience of being strip-searched as terrifying, embarrassing, invasive and dehumanising. One participant described it as \u201cthe most embarrassing and invasive process in my life\u201d, while another reflected that \u201cbeing ordered to strip, it felt \u2026 dehumanising \u2026 it put images in my mind of being a prisoner\u201d. For one young woman, the experience of being strip-searched was particularly traumatic and debilitating as it triggered significant distress associated with her previous experiences of sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Crying, she recalled what happened to her more than a year earlier: \u201cI was in the corner \u2026 my back against the wall, and I was just shaking because I thought strip-search meant cavity search, and I was saying \u201cyou don\u2019t have the right to touch my body! I don\u2019t give you permission to touch my body! ... I thought she was going to pin me down and put her hands inside my body\u201d. The incident had resulted in significant ongoing emotional trauma, negatively affecting her mental and physical health, her capacity to work, her personal relationships and her trust in police, including her willingness to help, or ask for help from police in future. The potential for sniffer dogs and strip-searches to reduce trust in police is of particular concern in relation to already marginalised groups such as First Nations (Atsi) and queer (LGBTI+) communities, who are disproportionately targeted by dog operations (such as at Redfern station and at Mardi Gras parties) and by more general strip-search practices. This gives a particular resonance to the claim made in the UNSW report that many strip-searches are carried out for \u201ca range of non-legal purposes, including punishment and humiliation\u201d. The recent suggestion by the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, in response to growing public concerns about strip-searches, that it was important that young people had a \u201clittle bit of fear of police\u201d also suggests that the searches are being deployed in an attempt to generate respect through the use of terror. Given that police and governments have long justified the use of sniffer dogs on the basis that they act as a deterrent and send a strong message about drugs, it is also likely that many strip-searches are, like the dogs, being deployed as a symbolic deterrence measure rather than simply a detection mechanism. Indeed, most drug dog indications do not lead to police finding any drugs, and those that do generally only lead to the confiscation of small amounts likely intended for personal use. And as several studies, including my own, have shown, the drug dog operations are not preventing drugs getting into events, nor are they acting as a drug use deterrent, but are instead encouraging young people to adapt their drug using behaviours in a range of dangerous ways. This includes pre-loading additional drugs before an event, buying drugs from less reliable suppliers inside, transporting drugs in anal and vaginal cavities, and \u2013 most concerningly of all \u2013 panicking upon seeing the dogs and taking all their drugs at once. At least two or three overdose fatalities at music festivals have been directly linked by coroners to this kind of dog-induced panic. The strip-searches being deployed as part of these drug dog operations no doubt contribute to the fear young people have of them and the kinds of harmful drug consumption practices that result. In these contexts, then, strip-searches are not only producing significant emotional trauma but are increasing a range of substantial health risks for young people. No one, and certainly not children, should be strip-searched for suspicion of minor infringements such as the possibility they might be carrying small quantities of illicit drugs for personal use, or as a deterrent to others to do so. Strip-searches and drug dogs are currently being used as a tool through which to terrorise young people, particularly marginalised young people. They are not reducing drug use or increasing anyone\u2019s safety, but are causing significant and lasting trauma and harm. It is great that the toxic brutality of these practices is currently receiving the public attention and criticism it deserves; let\u2019s now put in place legislative reforms to ensure our children and young people are cared for through evidence-based harm reduction initiatives and practices that respect their bodily autonomy. In contrast to the NSW police minister\u2019s concerning claim that he would be happy for his kids to be strip-searched by police, if \u201cthey were at risk of doing something wrong\u201d, under no circumstances would I ever want anyone to strip-search my children, no matter what a dog thought it had identified or what they were believed to be hiding or doing wrong. \u2022 Peta Malins is a lecturer in criminology and justice studies at RMIT University, Melbourne"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
