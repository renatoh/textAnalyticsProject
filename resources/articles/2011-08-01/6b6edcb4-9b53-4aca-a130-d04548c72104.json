Her nine-person team was immediately shrunk by two and, after 25 years, the service will disappear entirely if no new cash arrives next March. \"We have kept some services running by applying to the Department of Health, and got some money for a project supporting children who have a parent in prison from Lloyds TSB's Foundation. But if by Christmas we don't get new money I will have to think about giving everybody redundancy [cheques]\". If that happens, 167 families with 406 children will be left without a service which, Watson said, many parents struggling to bring up children had come to rely on for school runs, doctor's trips and, in some cases, a shoulder to lean on. Some in government argue that the \"creative destruction\" of public spending cuts will be good for charities by ensuring only the fittest and leanest survive. By winnowing out charities that became dependent on state funding and promoting others that have the scale and the flexibility to thrive in a new funding environment, so the thinking goes, the voluntary sector will emerge ready to take over public services. Watson says such thinking misses the point. Her service is already cost-effective, providing crucial support beyond the reach of the state at just \u00a321 a week for each family. \"We need money to run the police checks, manage volunteers, pay for an office and even put an ad in the local paper. Nothing comes for free. I cannot see how you could do it cheaper,\" says Watson. A report published by trade union-backed False Economy on Tuesday, which shows the impact of local authority spending cuts, has laid bare some of the contradictions of government policy. Although ministers have spent months promoting the idea of volunteering, community groups and charities running public services, the message has been undermined by the extent of cuts to their funding. Home Start has 330 local divisions, and says 40 of these are under threat because of the cuts. Almost 6,000 children will be affected. Branches in Bromley, south-east London, and Hampshire face closure this week. \"It is the depth and the speed of the cuts which have made it so difficult to cope,\" said Vivien Waterfield, director of fundraising at Home Start. There is renewed concern in the sector that the pruning of public spending will shrink the sector. Earlier this year the Charity Commission revealed that more than 8,000 charities have been removed from the official register since May 2010 \u2013 and only 6,400 new charities have been founded in their place. False Economy has identified cuts of more than \u00a3110m across charities in England as local authorities withdraw funding. There has been a rush for charities to huddle together to weather the economic storm. The commission reported a 150% increase in the number of mergers it had to deal with. Experts say many innovative schemes may be lost in the rush to make savings. Your Sanctuary, formerly Surrey Women's Aid, hit the headlines earlier this year for offering confidential helpline advice and one-to-one meetings to men who have been abused. One in six men suffer from domestic violence, according to the latest British Crime Survey figures. Yet the charity's chief executive, Beverley Pass, said that it still ended up losing \u00a338,000 last year, even though it picked up new funding. \"My worry is that local councils are making these decisions on the basis of how they go down with local people. Some services are not politically popular and they are being cut.\" Jack Dromey, Labour's shadow communities and local government minister, says the government has hit councils with \"huge, front-loaded cuts \u2026 and the voluntary sector and community groups up and down the country are paying the price\". Yet some charities have managed to cling on. Hilary Pannick started her award-winning Straight Talking charity 13 years ago in her loft. Its innovative model aims to get single mothers and fathers back into work by paying them to educate their peers in school on the pleasures and perils of early parenting. She admits being \"very angry last year\" when councils cut \u00a360,000 from her charity's budget \u2013 and she had to close services in the south-west. \"It seemed so short-sighted. For the first five years a teenage mother costs the taxpayer \u00a3100,000 and we were helping to cut that [bill]. We had to work twice as hard and made redundancies and got some money from the Department of Health. Basically we clung on by the skin of our teeth.\" Pannick says that her concern is that the coalition is reshaping too much of government too quickly. \"We don't know where anything is or how to apply for grants. It's really very hard to navigate. The private sector can do it much more easily - and I worry we will lose out to them in the end.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
