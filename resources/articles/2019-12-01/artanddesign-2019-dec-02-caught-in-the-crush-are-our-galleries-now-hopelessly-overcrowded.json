But as I progress through Tate Britain\u2019s blockbuster William Blake exhibition on this Saturday afternoon, the sense of hostility from fellow London gallery-goers intensifies. At Blake\u2019s 1793 masterpiece Albion Rose, which measures a scant 25cm by 21cm, a scrum of visitors peer and crane over each other\u2019s heads. In front of Blake\u2019s 1805 The Temptation and Fall of Eve, I sense the unmistakable feeling of elbows on ribs. By the time I reach the room containing his Illuminated Books, I am on the verge of giving up \u2013 and I am not alone. Next to me, two middle-aged women discuss coming back on a weekday, when the exhibition will be less crowded. Perhaps it was to be expected: the exhibition has had rave reviews. But my experience was not anomalous. Venture to many blockbuster exhibitions, particularly on a weekend, and you\u2019ll often be met with overwhelming crowds. Is there a surfeit of public interest in art? Are galleries packing in the crowds to maximise profit? And how best to meet the growing demand for public art without turning museums into amusement parks, complete with heavily managed queues? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pleasant,\u201d remembers Alex Goudie, a 33-year-old civil servant from Liverpool, who went to the Saatchi Gallery\u2019s Tutankhamun exhibition last month. On seeing the crowds, Goudie\u2019s immediate thought was to turn around and leave \u2013 despite having spent \u00a380 on the train fare and a ticket for the show. \u201cThere were a few hundred people in a very small area, trying to get glimpses of these artefacts.\u201d It\u2019s not just the blockbusters you have to watch out for: galleries can be held hostage by their most famous pieces. After Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z posed in front of the Mona Lisa in a 2018 music video, visitors numbers to the Louvre in Paris surged to 10.2 million. In May, staff walked out in protest at persistent overcrowding, explaining that attendance had increased by 20% since 2009, but security staff had decreased by 17%. Things have gotten so bad that the New York Times recently called for the Mona Lisa to be moved to a specially built facility outside the main space in order to alleviate overcrowding. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having a Mona Lisa fiasco all summer,\u201d museum expert Stephanie Nadalo of the New School University says with a sigh. She is critical of the Louvre\u2019s decision to temporarily relocate Da Vinci\u2019s most famous artwork to the Galerie M\u00e9dicis while its Salle des \u00c9tats room underwent renovation. \u201cIt felt like a rugby match. The guards were losing control. People were shouting.\u201d Institutions outside capital cities can experience pressures, too. \u201cThere were quite a lot of elbows,\u201d says Edward Packard of his visit to Oxford\u2019s Weston Library for its Tolkien exhibition last year. The 38-year-old lecturer, from Ipswich, found it impossible to engage with any of the artefacts meaningfully. \u201cIf you stood in front of something for more than 20 seconds,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019d find someone pushing you. Especially as I\u2019m tall. People wanted me out of the way!\u201d This trend has been going on for some time. \u201cIt was horrific,\u201d says 46-year-old Lizzie Hughes, an artist from London, of her visit to Beyond Caravaggio at London\u2019s National Gallery two years ago. \u201cLike being in a nightclub. You couldn\u2019t even see the pictures \u2013 you were being pushed around by the crowd. It was scary.\u201d Despite paying \u00a316, Hughes left without viewing all the paintings, because she felt unsafe. \u201cIt was horrible.\u201d Are these crowds actually dangerous? Probably not, says Paul Townsend of Crowd Dynamics, experts at crowd control. \u201cThey will have to follow building safety regulations,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely to be an unsafe crowd.\u201d But there can be a huge difference between optimum conditions for viewing art and the number of people that can legally be contained in a space. \u201cWhen you let too many people in,\u201d says Townsend, \u201cyou compromise the quality of the experience.\u201d In theory, timed-entry tickets should prevent overcrowding. In practice, they don\u2019t. Natalie Drenth, a 27-year-old marketing officer from Birmingham, recently visited Gauguin Portraits, also at the National Gallery. \u201cThe exhibition was very overcrowded, despite being given an allocated time slot,\u201d she says. Waking up early doesn\u2019t seem to help: Hughes booked an 8.30am slot for Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams at the V&amp;A in London earlier this year. By 9.45am, the exhibition was chockablock. \u201cThe vibe was so bad,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t engage with the work in a way that meant anything to me. It\u2019s the exact opposite of what looking at art should be like.\u201d When so many people are crammed into a small space, the mood can rapidly turn sour. One Tate employee, who did not want to be named, says visitors often complain about there being too many children: \u201cThey say it\u2019s turning into a children\u2019s zoo.\u201d Goudie left the Saatchi after witnessing a scuffle between two people who\u2019d been pushing each other in front of a sarcophagus. \u201cI was relieved to get out,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s put me off going to a really big exhibition again.\u201d Art requires space to be properly appreciated, as Ravi Ghosh, a 22-year-old writer from London, discovered when he attended the Royal Academy\u2019s Antony Gormley retrospective in September. \u201cSo much of his work relies on you having a clear eye-line,\u201d Ghosh says. \u201cIt was disappointing. You feel like you\u2019re not given the opportunity to appreciate the art how the artist would have wanted.\u201d Who is to blame? \u201cThe galleries,\u201d says Hughes firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s their space and they\u2019re selling the tickets. It can\u2019t be that hard to work out what the optimum number of people in a space. They\u2019re obviously packing them in to make money.\u201d It\u2019s hard not to see overcrowding as a symptom of continued cuts to arts funding: 74% of arts organisations have experienced public funding cuts. In 2018, Arts Council England announced a budgetary shortfall of \u00a3156m. As a result, institutions often plump for blockbusters that will be shared on social media. \u201cGalleries are businesses who want to make money,\u201d says the Tate employee, who singles out the current show at Tate Modern by Olafur Eliasson, a kaleidoscopic journey through light shows, fog room and mirror tunnels. \u201cYou\u2019re selling people an image to use on their Facebook or Instagram. People want a picture of themselves in the fog room. Art has become a brand everyone needs a bit of.\u201d The rise and rise of smartphone photography is another cause of overcrowding, as people linger while taking shots. \u201cEveryone has to take a photo of an object to feel like they\u2019ve seen it,\u201d says Nadalo. Photography was banned at the 2016 Gustave Caillebotte retrospective at the Kimbell Museum, Texas, in an attempt to keep people moving. Visitors were permitted to take selfies outside the exhibition at specially erected replicas of the Frenchman\u2019s most popular artworks. Given the dire funding situation, the blockbuster trend looks set to continue. \u201cBlockbusters are part of the game,\u201d says Nadalo. \u201cYou need a blockbuster to finance the exhibitions that are academically interesting or experimental or won\u2019t bring in the crowds.\u201d One curator at the V&amp;A admitted to being aware of overcrowding, but added: \u201cIn terms of building audiences for the major museums, blockbuster exhibitions are really important. The issue isn\u2019t about doing fewer popular exhibitions, but trying to find a way to manage them when they\u2019re huge successes.\u201d Some galleries have implemented certain measures. Reservations are obligatory at the Louvre\u2019s major Da Vinci retrospective and tickets are limited \u2013 when they sell out, it\u2019s sold out. Michael Asher\u2019s 2010 Whitney Biennial in New York was open for 24 hours for three consecutive days, to enable gallery-going for people working nine-to-five jobs. At the Saatchi\u2019s Tutankhamun, information boxes are displayed in large text above head height, readable for large crowds. Some institutions, such as Tate, have implemented members-only hours for a quieter visiting experience. When contacted, many of the galleries mentioned here made similar points: that visitor numbers are kept within safe levels and continually monitored by staff, and timed-entry ticket slots help manage popular exhibitions. But despite these efforts, it\u2019s clear that the experience for many visitors remains far from optimal. Why should we care if our public galleries are overcrowded? Because when a space becomes over-full, it is often only the lucky few who are able to engage meaningfully with art: the critics at the previews, those able to visit on the quieter weekdays. Ghosh wonders if critics would be so generous if they had to experience exhibitions as regular members of the public. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally different experience,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen you\u2019re a lowly punter.\u201d To avoid the crowds, Lizzie Hughes considered taking out annual memberships of her favourite galleries, but the price of this extra access was too costly. Now she doesn\u2019t go to major shows. \u201cIt makes me feel that I am outside of the cultural conversations,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I haven\u2019t seen the exhibitions people have seen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
