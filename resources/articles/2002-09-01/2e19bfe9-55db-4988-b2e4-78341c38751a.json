No sooner had I taken over the club than the FA charged us with contract irregularities and we were fined \u00a3100,000 and docked four points. It's making life very difficult because, five weeks into the season, we're still bottom of the table but I've no regrets about becoming involved - I love a challenge. I've always made it clear that rugby is my first love and I bought Boston because, as a property developer, I want to put a supermarket on our York Street ground and build a 9,000-capacity stadium on farmland on the outskirts of the town. But since becoming chairman, football has grown on me. I've been criticised by some supporters for not attending many games but no one should doubt my commitment to any of my interests: the club, salmon fishing in Scotland, spending a week with my family at Disneyland Paris or taking part in a classic car rally which ended up being in Prague. I simply honoured some previously arranged promises. The second part of the FA hearing into charges against our suspended manager, Steve Evans, and former chairman, Pat Malkinson, was due to start on Wednesday but it's been postponed - leaving us in a state of limbo. Caretaker Neil Thompson is doing a very professional job under difficult circumstances and the board will meet this week to discuss the situation. We weren't helped by striker Daryl Clare refusing to sit on the substitutes' bench during our 3-1 defeat by Oxford on Saturday and then being placed on the transfer list. When I return from Prague today, I'll want to hear both sides of the story first-hand. It needs sorting quickly because we play second-from-bottom Swansea City at York Street on Wednesday. A win by two clear goals would take us above them alphabetically. Perhaps I can become the team's lucky mascot when I put in an appearance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
