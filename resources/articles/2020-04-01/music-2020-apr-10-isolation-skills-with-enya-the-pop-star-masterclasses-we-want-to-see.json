The pop star masterclasses we want to see", "bodyText": "Look, you know the deal. We\u2019re in a global pandemic, and everyone has to do what they can to help other people. It might be shopping for your elderly neighbour, or it could be nailing your parents\u2019 front door shut because they\u2019re insisting if they stay inside \u201cthe disease wins!\u201d Celebs are also pitching in: BTS are teaching Korean online, Natalie Portman is giving acting lessons and Joe Wicks is making horny mums pretend to like online workouts. But this is only the start. There are so many pop stars with valuable skills that could be imparted to the general public... Mariah Carey: denial Mariah Carey doesn\u2019t have birthdays or age, she simply celebrates \u201canniversaries\u201d of turning 12 years old. It\u2019s getting a bit weird now, as her children are catching up (twins Moroccan and Monroe are nine this month), but honestly, wouldn\u2019t we all be having far fewer panic attacks if we retreated into fantastical denial? Also: birthdays in isolation don\u2019t count, right? Enya: isolation skills Notoriously reclusive Enya lives alone in a castle in Dublin, rarely appears in public and spends her days singing in a made-up language to her cats. And, castle aside, that\u2019s basically 2020 vibes all round. Admittedly it\u2019d be quite the U-turn for her to start giving out tips on how to survive isolation over Instagram Live, but in a rare interview five years ago, she revealed she got really into Breaking Bad. Feels like a good place to start. Adele: pub banter After months only socialising on House Party, we\u2019ll all have forgotten how to interact when we\u2019re finally allowed back in pubs. So draft in the A-list\u2019s face of relatable normality, who everyone wants to go on a night out with: Adele. Imagine her reminding us that if we want to leave a conversation in real life, it\u2019s not OK to pretend the wifi\u2019s gone down and simply slam your laptop shut. When you\u2019re in an IRL pub, you can\u2019t help yourself from the fridge \u2013 and please, please wear clothes on your bottom half. Ariana Grande: working from home style Before recent events, the internet mocked Ariana Grande for living in oversized hoodies, always wearing her hair in a ponytail and mostly communicating by Twitter, but look at us now. Turns out she was actually a visionary. Rita Ora: side hustle Rita Ora never met a side project she didn\u2019t like: from actor to model to TV presenter to fashion designer, she\u2019s had a crack at everything, alongside what is ostensibly her actual job (mid-level pop star). She even joined The Masked Singer panel, despite not being able to name one celebrity who wasn\u2019t her real-life friend. It didn\u2019t matter! In these economically unstable, furloughing times, it\u2019s good to be open to new things."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
