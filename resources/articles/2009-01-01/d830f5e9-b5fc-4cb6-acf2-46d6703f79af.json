Before becoming Clinton's chief of staff in 1994, Panetta was director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, and before that a congressman from California and an attorney. Panetta's chief foreign policy experience is as a member of the Iraq Study Group, the congressional panel charged in 2006 with reassessing US strategy in that country. The report, filed in December of that year, had no discernible effect on Bush's war plan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
