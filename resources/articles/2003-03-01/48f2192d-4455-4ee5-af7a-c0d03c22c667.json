The teacher sits on the floor because the whiteboard is a child's painting easel. The classroom we are in is used in the mornings as a nursery, but this is to the teacher's advantage because many of the students are illiterate or semi-literate (in both their first language and English), and the many posters and exercises for learning the alphabet can be adapted for use with the adult students. I am observing a teacher who is fresh from a four-week Cambridge Esol Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults (Celta) course and who has volunteered to teach a group of beginners. What defines this particular group of students is that they are all Kurdish men, relocated to west London when their former home, the Sangatte refugee centre in northern France, was closed in December. With little prospect of getting language support, a charity called Community Language Centres (CLC) stepped in to offer 80 of them English language courses, but government funding was only sufficient to pay for two teachers. My involvement started in January when I received a call from an ex-trainee from one of the Celta courses I help to run at International House in London. He wanted to know if I knew of any teachers who might be able to volunteer some of their time to assist the CLC project - 10 hours per week and with an immediate start. I didn't hold out much hope, given that most ELT professionals in London are busy looking for what paid work they can find. But I was wrong - a large number of people have volunteered their help and given their time. Meanwhile, International House agreed to provide a financial incentive to the volunteers in the form of a lunch and travel expenses package. Of the seven teachers who have volunteered five have been newly qualified. I felt that some developmental feedback, along with the expenses cheque from International House, would be welcome. From my previous conversations with teachers I knew that the teaching was proving rewarding, yet challenging, and I knew that the teachers were spending considerable amounts of their own time offering help and support to the students, and worrying about their lesson plans. As I sat watching the lessons, I wondered how the Celta course had prepared the teachers for this particular group, and what we might have been able to do differently or in addition to help prepare them for teaching Esol (English for speakers of other languages) classes. The class I observe is going well, but one of the biggest challenges for the teacher is that some of the students seem unable or are unwilling to listen to their classmates. I suspect that this is caused, in part, by social differences - these are visible from the students' dress, and by what they say their jobs were when they were in Iraq. Some of the students seem to be ignored by the others, and the answers they do offer are scoffed at. These students probably have very little previous experience of working collaboratively in a lesson and they are, quite naturally, all simultaneously seeking the attention of the teacher. The teacher is gently persisting in encouraging pair work, and is having some success by devising tasks that force the learners to refer to each other for practice and information. An early concern voiced by teachers was about the teaching of script. On most Celta courses, while trainees teach a low-level group for at least part of their teaching practice, it is unusual for them to encounter serious issues with reading and writing - most of their students are comfortable with the English alphabet. In fact, in ELT in general the number of classes for absolute beginners is in decline. The particular needs of this group of asylum seekers are therefore unusual. The teachers, with the help of some International House teaching materials designed for use in script classes, are quickly learning to integrate a literacy angle into their lessons. They are learning, too, that they need to keep lesson topics focused towards the specific day-to-day needs of the students. One of the teachers has been spending her mornings working on rudimentary CVs, which the students are using to take to the local job centre. The afternoon classes are focusing on the sorts of dialogues and exchanges the learners need to engage in to survive in London. The teachers have learnt that their students are grappling with culture shock, and that something as simple as a map of the tube can be very confusing - one student thought that he could walk to St Paul's in about 20 minutes because it was only a few stops away. The teachers' Celta training, while not directly geared towards this type of teaching, has actually provided them with an excellent foundation. They have been quick to see where they can adapt published materials and where they need to devise their own. There has been a lot of debate recently regarding Esol provision in Britain and the similarities and differences between EFL and Esol. I am not sure that any generic teacher training qualification would have prepared these volunteers for this kind of teaching. The needs of the learners are so specific, and unique to this context, that they have needed to do what they have been trained to do - to focus on their learners' needs, and to find ways to address these. Along the way, they have met an interesting and very appreciative group of learners, who have undoubtedly helped them to broaden and develop their range of teaching techniques. \u00b7 Helen Barker is a director of studies at International House, London"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
