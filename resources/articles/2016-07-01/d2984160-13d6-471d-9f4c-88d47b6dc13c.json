Chelsea Clinton, the only child of Bill and Hillary Clinton, introduced her mother at the Democratic convention, speaking before Hillary Clinton made history by becoming the first woman in history to accept the presidential nomination of a major political party. Speaking slowly and in slightly faltering voice that did not recall the conversational ease of her father or the fierce conviction of her \u201cwonderful, thoughtful, hilarious mother\u201d, Chelsea explained how her mother taught her that \u201cpublic service is about service\u201d. \u201cAs her daughter, I\u2019ve had a front-row seat to how she serves,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her holding the hands of mothers struggling to feed their kids or get them the healthcare they need, my mother promising to do everything she could to help.\u201d She recalled what she called the \u201clow points\u201d of her mother\u2019s life, focusing on her failed fight for healthcare reform. \u201cIt was bruising and exhausting. She fought her heart out, and she lost \u2026 She took a little time to replenish her spirits. Family movie nights definitely helped \u2013 Dad, as you heard [on Tuesday], liked Police Academy; my mom and I loved Pride and Prejudice. \u201cAnd then she got right back to work, because she thought she could still make a difference for kids.\u201d Hillary Clinton never forgot who she was fighting for, Chelsea said, listing as examples foster children, 9/11 first responders and \u201cwomen around the world\u201d. \u201cFights like these \u2013 they\u2019re what keep my mother going. They grab her heart and her conscience and they never, ever let go.\u201d In November, Chelsea said, she would be voting \u201cfor the progressive who will protect our planet from climate change and our communities from gun violence, who will reform our criminal justice system, and who believes that women\u2019s rights are human rights, and LGBT rights are human rights, here and around the world\u201d. And she said she hoped that one day her children would be as proud of her as she was of her other, closing the speech \u2013 after a video about Hillary Clinton\u2019s life, narrated by Morgan Freeman \u2013 by introducing \u201cmy mother, my hero, and our next president: Hillary Clinton\u201d. \u201cThis election is so important to me because I\u2019m now a mom,\u201d Chelsea told NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer on Thursday. \u201cAs proud as I am of my mom, this election to me is fundamentally about my children, about Charlotte and Aidan. I couldn\u2019t imagine a better president for them \u2013 I couldn\u2019t imagine a better grandmother for them either.\u201d In June, Chelsea gave birth to a son, Aidan, the second child for her and husband Marc Mezvinsky. Hillary often shares anecdotes about her grandchildren at campaign stops and has described being a grandmother as \u201ctruly like falling in love all over again\u201d. Chelsea told NBC: \u201cI just hope that people understand even a little more when I\u2019m done [with her speech] than when I started about why I love her so much and admire her so much,\u201d she said. During Hillary Clinton\u2019s first presidential bid in 2008, the former first daughter went to great lengths to avoid the press, and on one memorable occasion told a fourth-grade \u201ckid reporter\u201d from Scholastic News that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t talk to the press\u201d. Eight years later, she has re-emerged more comfortable in her role in the Clinton triumvirate. On the campaign trail, Chelsea seems at ease in front of large crowds, appearing as a lead surrogate for her mother. She has also taken on a more significant leadership role at the family\u2019s Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton\u2019s biggest challenge in the coming months will be to convince the American people to trust her. Her daughter\u2019s speech on Thursday night was an opportunity to pull back the curtain on a woman the campaign described earlier this week as \u201cthe most famous, least-known person in the country\u201d. The introduction will inevitably draw comparisons with the speech made at the Republican convention last week by Ivanka Trump, who introduced her father, Donald Trump, in Cleveland, making the case that as president he would be a \u201cfighter\u201d who will \u201cfight for you\u201d. In Cleveland, Ivanka directly engaged critics who have challenged her father\u2019s hiring practices and treatment of women, calling him \u201ccolor-blind and gender-neutral\u201d. She also said the Republican nominee would fight for equal pay for women and affordable childcare, making a clear attempt to win over female voters who might be more inclined to feel Hillary Clinton would stand up for their interests. Earlier this week, Chelsea expressed doubt that Donald Trump would be a good candidate for women when asked during a panel discussion about Ivanka\u2019s portrayal of her father as a \u201cGloria Steinem of the Republican party\u201d. \u201cHow would your father do that, given it\u2019s not something he\u2019s spoken out?\u201d Chelsea said she would ask Ivanka, a longtime friend. \u201cThere are no policies on any of those fronts that you just mentioned on his website \u2013 not last week, not this week. So I think the \u2018how\u2019 question is super-important \u2013 in politics as it is in life.\u201d Chelsea reaffirmed on Thursday that she and Ivanka have remained friends despite the bitter campaign between their parents. She told NBC: \u201cI think it was clear last week, when Ivanka introduced her dad, that she\u2019s so proud of him. I hope it will be at least as clear why I\u2019m so proud of my mom when I introduce her here in Philadelphia. \u201cAnd yet clearly, Ivanka and I have very different views about who we think should be our president, who we think best represents our country.\u201d Asked if she would consider holding a \u201cchildren\u2019s summit\u201d with Ivanka to try to raise the tone of the election campaign, Chelsea said it had not occurred her but it was \u201ccertainly something I would consider\u201d. She added: \u201cI think it\u2019s clear that Mr Trump is running his campaign and saying what he thinks is important in this election. I think what were seeing here in Philadelphia is a very strong contrast to that. My mother\u2019s not engaging in divisive, bigoted rhetoric.\u201d Whether Chelsea or Ivanka becomes the next first daughter, both are expected to be the most politically engaged women in that role since Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s daughter Anna in the 1940s. \u201cChelsea and Ivanka are major figures in the 2016 campaign,\u201d wrote Joshua Kendall, author of First Dads: Parenting and Politics from George Washington to Barack Obama, in the Washington Post. \u201cLike Anna Roosevelt, both daughters are likely to be enlisted as part-time first ladies: Chelsea because the nation\u2019s first gentleman would want to pursue other interests and Ivanka because her stepmother seems to like her privacy \u2026 After January, it\u2019s hard to imagine that either daughter would turn down whatever assignment dropped on her lap.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
