These were the opening skirmishes of a fight scarcely less important than the main event: for the attention and pay-per-view pounds of fans also being beguiled by the meeting between the Irish UFC fighter Conor McGregor and the freshly un-retired Floyd Mayweather, which takes place tat the same venue, the T-Mobile Arena, hree weeks earlier. Golovkin, who brings to the fight an unblemished record of 37 professional wins, 33 of them by knock-out, insisted the Mayweather fight is a mere sideshow. \u201cThat\u2019s not a fight, it\u2019s business,\u201d the champion said. \u201cI think people understand. Do they want a true fight, a boxing fight? That\u2019s mine with Canelo. Or a big show, maybe a funny show, a circus show? Conor is no boxer. If you want to watch a show, watch that one. If you want to watch boxing, watch mine.\u201d Frank Warren, whose BoxNation will broadcast the Golovkin defence in the UK, was in no doubt about which has the greater sporting merit. \u201cThis will be the fight of 2017,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a freakshow, it\u2019s a real fight.\u201d Warren announced that Billy Joe Saunders will defend his WBO middleweight title against an as-yet unconfirmed opponent at the Copper Box on the same night. Saunders, looking some way from peak fitness, took the opportunity to challenge either of the headline boxers to a fight. \u201cI didn\u2019t even recognise him, to tell you the truth,\u201d \u00c1lvarez said later. \u201cHe\u2019s got to come down in weight first before he thinks about fighting one of us. I\u2019ve never really studied him but I can promise you this: with one hand tied behind my back and my eyes closed, I\u2019d be able to beat him.\u201d Saunders may find that both \u00c1lvarez and Golovkin are preoccupied for a while yet. The Kazakh, who at 34 is eight years \u00c1lvarez\u2019s senior, is already keen to arrange a rematch. \u201cMaybe there won\u2019t be only one fight, maybe two or three fights,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is interesting. Why not?\u201d Oscar De La Hoya, \u00c1lvarez\u2019s promoter, had a similar vision, which he said came to him in a dream. \u201cI strongly feel that Canelo and Golovkin can be a trilogy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know for sure, guaranteed, that this fight will deliver, because of their styles. Gennady is a hard puncher, he has a great chin, he comes forward, he has tremendous skills, and so does Canelo. Neither fighter knows how to take a step back. The fans are going to be treated to a wonderful fight.\u201d The only dissent came from \u00c1lvarez, who had been encouraged by Daniel Jacobs\u2019s performance in losing to Golovkin on points at Madison Square Garden in March, which had ended Golovkin\u2019s run of 24 successive knock-outs. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a difficult fight. I\u2019m confident I\u2019m going to win, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be an easy fight. It\u2019s going to be a very tight, very hard fight,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to prove in the first fight that there\u2019s no reason to have a second or a third.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
