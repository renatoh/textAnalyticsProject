Our MP3 players look like works of art and our phones can't get much thinner, so why do we work in the aesthetic equivalent of a wet weekend in Luton? Most of our offices are a perpetual Arndale Centre of drab desks, tacky plastic and ergonomic hazards. \"We spend most of our time at work: it's a big chunk of our day so of course it affects us,\" says Ron Arad, top product and interior designer (you'll know him for his curvy Bookworm bookcase or voluptous Tom Vac chairs). \"You don't have to be a great thinker to know that a pleasant environment is a good thing.\" But pinning down what constitutes a pleasant environment takes a little more intellect. \"I try to make my spaces exciting and exhilarating,\" explains Arad, whose work appears in museums and galleries around the world. \"Different things make that possible - the space itself, the proportions, the objects, the colours, the air, the textures and the views.\" How many of those factors \"exhilarate\" you when you sit down in the morning? Is your office an exciting place to be - or is that wall-to-wall beige about to send you over the edge? Jeremy Myerson is Professor of Design Studies at the Royal College of Art, and a specialist in office design. In Space to Work (Laurence King, \u00a335), he showcases 40 great offices from around the world in order to illustrate the problems most of us face in shabby, headache-inducing cubicles. \"If we go into a shop that has bad lighting, we don't want to shop there,\" he says. \"Most offices are appallingly lit, so why should we put up with them?\" He thinks our dull workplaces are relics of a bygone era: \"Most people now are what are known as knowledge workers - they use a set of skills to complete tasks that are not linear, they are not processes. But our offices are still based on factory floors.\" Myerson believes that any space will grate if we're forced to spend eight hours sitting in it - and that modern offices should reflect the changing way we work. \"Most offices fail on the basics. Bad air, poor acoustic privacy - so there's lots of noise, bad lighting and cheap furniture which can damage our health,\" he says. \"The best offer a variety of places to work. Some have low seating areas with points for laptops, or gardens, or rooftop terraces. Wireless networking has helped a lot.\" The way we work has changed, Myerson says. Employees need flexibility in their work spaces - at home and at work: \" Let's take some of the regimentation out of the working day.\" Ron Arad's studio is a perfect example. \"Fantastic things happen there,\" he says. \"An architecture job is only as good as the client, so when you get the chance to be your own client you have to make the most of it. I have designed several of our studios in the past, and they've always been places where new ideas are allowed to develop. \"For example, I'm very fond of my desk, which was part of an installation we did in Milan. It's a formation of reflective tables. Each one is a different shape, like an exploding spiral. They're all sort of lightly curved around you, but very thin, on very thin legs, so you can pick what shape suits you and which part to work on.\" Good luck asking your boss for one - a recent example of Arad's bespoke design work, a rocking chair, went for $190,000. But if exploding, reflective spiral desks and flexible working represent the top of the scale, Sick Building Syndrome is the bottom. Imagine working somewhere where the air quality is so bad (usually because of poor design) that it actually makes you ill. Symptoms can include headaches, eye, nose and throat irritation, coughs, itching, dizziness and nausea, difficulty concentrating, fatigue and sensitivity to odours. Insert your own \"sounds like a normal day to me\" joke here. Funnily enough, non-stop sickness isn't top of most people's To Do lists - but neither is overhauling the entire office. So, what can you do to make things better now, today? (Well, after lunch anyway, or tomorrow, or definitely this week.) \"Demand that you're near natural light and preferably a window that opens,\" advises Myerson. \"Get yourself a task light - you don't need hot lights beating down on your head, you need a light on the papers next to you. \"It's all about local control - windows, lights, air - unlike the 1990s when it was all done by central computers, which was like hell. Can you organise it with IT so you can get your emails and files from home? Or negotiate with your boss to work from home a couple of days a week?\" According to Ron Arad, our offices are dull because \"most of our restaurants are dull, most of our cinemas are dull, most of our cars are dull, most of the music on the radio is dull - the world tends towards sameness.\" So, strike a blow for freedom and difference (or something) and demand more from your desk. Even if you can't change the fact that Keane dominates the airwaves, you can get yourself a rather more exciting workspace. Some of the world's greatest designers have put their skills to work in the office. The Aeron Chair, by Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf, \u00a3450-\u00a3800 Surfaces made of mesh stretched across a frame mean you feel like you're floating - and you won't sweat if you sit in it for hours. Complete with every conceivable adjustment - and they all operate using gas pistons, so it's as smooth as Leslie Phillips. An ergonomic dream: once you've sat on one, you'll never go back. The Aluminum Group Chairs, Charles and Ray Eames, from around \u00a3800 If it's good enough for Mastermind, it's good enough for you. The classic modernist office chair, it is elegant, simple and effortlessly stylish. The aesthetic opposite of a short-sleeved shirt tucked into Farah slacks. The Anglepoise Lamp, pictured, George Carwardine, \u00a360-\u00a31,660 Designed by automotive engineer George Carwardine in 1932, it is based on a spring that flexes and holds in any position. The iconic lamp's original claim - that it was more energy-efficient because the beam went where directed, so needed a lower wattage bulb - will appeal to the greens. Advanced Table Module Desk System, Jasper Morrison, \u00a3POA The desks and lamps you see in the swanky offices on Spooks. Not just a desk, but a modular desking system with built in, specifically thought-through places for Post-It notes, keys and all the cables that come with working. Apple MacBook Pro, Jonathan Ive, \u00a31,349-\u00a31,899 Fully wireless-ready, for the perfect modern working environment. Only an inch thick when closed, it even looks slick enough to take to the pub at lunchtime to impress people. You can even treat yourself to a giant 30in screen (\u00a31,549) and external keyboard (\u00a319) - for ergonomic reasons, obviously..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
