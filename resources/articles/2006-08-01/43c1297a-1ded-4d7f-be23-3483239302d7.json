Rashid Rauf, arrested last week by the Pakistani police and alleged to have given information about a plot, is still being interrogated, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, Tasneem Aslam, said yesterday. Asked if he had had access to a lawyer, she said: \"I don't think we have reached that stage yet.\" She said there had been no official request from the British authorities for his extradition and she would not comment on reports that Scotland Yard detectives are in Islamabad to interview Mr Rauf, who security sources say is being held in a safe house used for interrogation, rather than in a jail or police station. Concerns have been expressed by two Pakistan-based human rights groups that Mr Rauf may be facing torture as part of the interrogation. Britain has no extradition treaty with Pakistan, although they operate what Ms Aslam described as mutual assistance. Mr Rauf was arrested in the Punjab, she said, along with an unspecified number of others whose names have not been given. Hina Jilani, a lawyer and human rights specialist, said Mr Rauf was lucky because the government had admitted he had been taken into custody and interrogated. \"As far as we know no lawyer has been approached to represent him,\" Ms Jilani said. \"But in this country people just disappear for two or three years. It is not unusual at all. He is lucky because people know who he is and what has happened to him. There will be due process to follow. What we have seen is that under the guise of anti-terrorism people have vanished. Mr Rauf has not, he is in custody.\" Mr Rauf can be held for one month without charge, a process that can be repeated for up to a year. There is a widely held suspicion in Pakistan that the plot has been cooked up to divert the world's press from events in the Middle East. Qazi Hussain Ahmad, leader of the radical Islamic party Jamaat-e-Islami, told the Guardian that the apparent plot to bomb passenger planes was a \"well-orchestrated ploy to divert the attention from the massacre of innocents of Lebanon by Israel\". Ms Aslam dismissed the suggestions. \"This is something too serious to be made up by any government. This was for real.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
