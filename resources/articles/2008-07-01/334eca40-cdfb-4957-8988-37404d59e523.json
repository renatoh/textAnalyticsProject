Here, year 6 children who've just left Queen's Drive primary school in Preston speak about their hopes and fears as they prepare for one of the biggest changes of their lives so far. Usamah bin Zahid Going to an independent co-ed school in Lytham To me, it all feels like this big experience that's just waiting for me. It's exciting, but at the same time it's scary. I'm the only person from my school going on to my new school. I applied to two state schools but I didn't get a place at either of them, and I didn't get a place at appeal either. I was really upset, and so was my mum. So now I'm going to an independent school instead, and I really like it: when I went to look round, the headteacher asked me about my hobbies on the tour, he wasn't just interested in the grown-ups. I liked that. I do worry about things like being bullied. I talked to a teacher about it when I went to look round, and he said if anyone is bullied here we come down on it like a ton of bricks. That makes me feel a lot safer. The other thing I asked about was racism, because there aren't many Asian children there, and he said the same thing about that too, so I felt reassured. The journey is going to be very different - I'll have to get a bus on my own and it will take 45 minutes to reach Lytham, where my new school is. The thing I'm most worried about is, will I make new friends? I live a long way from the school and I go to mosque every evening after school. I think what I might do is start going to mosque just two evenings a week, and then I can spend the other days getting involved in things after school, to meet new people. Jamie Shortall Going to Longridge high, a maths and computing comprehensive college in Preston I know quite a lot about my new school: my sister Phoebe is there, and my second cousin is one of the teachers. But it's still going to be new and strange, and I'll be sad about leaving my friends because I'm the only one from here going to that school. I'll have to walk there on my own because I don't know anyone else going there yet, and I'm certainly not walking with my sister! Ellie Stokes Going to Archbishop Temple High and technical college in Preston, an 11-16 comprehensive It feels sad to be leaving Queen's Drive primary. I've been here a long time - since reception. Miss Webster, our headteacher, has done lots to help us not to be too sad about leaving ... like she's given us all a folder and we can write our memories of being here. Things like your worst day ever at school, and your best day ever. At primary, you know everyone's name. You're a big fish in a small pond, and at your new school you know that you'll be a small fish in a big pond. That's quite frightening. Dinner time is going to be really different. At my new school, they have this system so you have a credit card with your photograph on it. The canteen looks really good - it's got these posh metal chairs and it looks a bit like a restaurant. I'm a bit worried about the bigger kids. I mean, mostly they'll be nice, but there could be some bad ones. And they do not-nice things sometimes, like telling you to go the wrong way when you're looking for somewhere so you get into trouble for being late. Lucy Simpson Going to Archbishop Temple high and technical college in Preston, an 11-16 comprehensive I worry about getting lost in my new school, because it's really big, but I'm looking forward to it as well. It's a Christian school and I didn't have to pass any tests to get in there, but I did have to be a churchgoer. And that's fine, because we do go to church, so I didn't worry about not getting in. It's a good school and they've got a new music block with a recording studio and a room with drums in it. So it's exciting; but what I do worry about mainly is friends, especially about the fact that Ellie, who's my best friend, will be at the same school, but not in the same form. I keep wondering how that's going to feel. We've been best friends from reception: how will it feel not being together all the time? Another worry is the homework. At secondary school you get more than you do at primary, and you have to do it more quickly and give it in after a shorter time. There are other things to get used to as well - things like lunch there is at 1pm, whereas at primary school it was at 12.05pm. It's going to seem funny having to wait an hour longer for lunch. Hope Jordan Going to Broughton business and enterprise college in Preston Not knowing our Sats results has been a bit of a bad thing at the end of primary school. It makes me feel unsettled. I'm not sure if this is right or not, but people say your Sats results have an effect on things like what set you're in at your new school - so I keep thinking, how will they know which set to put you in, if they don't know your results? The other thing is that you want to get your results while you're in your primary school with the teacher who taught you up to them, and now we're not going to do that. I think it's really bad that the government pressurises us to do well, and then doesn't even give us our results. Harry Holden Going to Broughton business and enterprise college in Preston I think secondary school will be full of challenges, and I'm looking forward to them. I like the idea of new subjects, like chemistry - and the opportunities for new sports, too. What makes me sad is losing friends - there are 17 of us going from here to my new school, but there are some people I really like who are going to other schools and I wonder, will we see each other? Some things will be very different: for example, instead of having just one teacher we'll have eight or 10. And there will be so many older pupils there - that will seem strange. They're so much bigger than us, and things are so different - for example, at one secondary school I looked round I noticed how many of the kids were swearing. You didn't get anyone swearing at primary school. I got into my second-place choice, which is fine - but it means I'm still on the waiting list for my first-place choice, and that's a bit annoying because it means you're not absolutely certain where you'll be going in September. Sana Bux Going to Penwortham girls' high, a comprehensive in Preston My dad wanted me to go to the Muslim girls' school but I preferred Penwortham, so that's where I'm going. I'm looking forward to it, but I am nervous: I'm really small for my age - some of the year 3 girls here are taller than me - and I keep thinking, will I be the smallest person in the whole school? They had a sample day there and I did enjoy myself. We had a tour, and then we had an art class. My favourite subjects are science and maths, and I think they're really good at my new school. I'm looking forward to joining lots of clubs too - they have things like dance and sewing and a bookworm club. The uniform is good too - it's cherry red, and I like it. I do worry sometimes: I think what if I accidentally forget something, will they give me a detention? I worry that I'll do something awful and that will be it, my reputation will be destroyed. We'll be going back to the children from Queen's Drive primary in October, to find out how they get on in their new schools. What the parents think Zahida bin Zahid, Usamah's mother I found the whole application process very stressful. You're told that you have a choice, but in reality it's not a choice because you're restricted to a certain area and to the school that offers you a place. Unfortunately, Usamah didn't get a place at either of the schools we applied for, which was very unsettling and upsetting. We want him to go to a good school where plenty will be expected of him, so in the end we're opting to pay for an independent school. But it's been a tough time all round. Jim Stokes, Ellie's father This is second time round for us, because Ellie's older sister is already at the secondary school where Ellie is now going. The fact that you've been through it all before does make it a lot easier - you know what to expect, for one thing. I'm excited for Ellie that she's about to make this big move - I think she's going to enjoy being in a different environment with more opportunities. She's loved primary school but she's outgrown it, and it's time to move on. Yasmin Bux, Sana's mother It was quite difficult working out which school was right, but Sana's father felt she had to go to a single-sex school so in a way that made the choice easier. It seems odd to me, though, that they move on at 11, because in India, where I'm from, you stay at the same school from four or five to 15 or 16. The system here is very different, and I worry about Sana losing friends she's had since reception. Judith Brayshaw, Lucy's mother The thing that's struck me is how the secondary schools go out of their way to make the transition easier. I've been really impressed by it - they give the children maps; they have them in to see their new form room; they introduce them to pupils already at the school. It means they're familiar with the new environment from day one, and that's got to help them to settle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
