Woodpeckers peck wood, bee-eaters feed on bees, and whitethroats are indeed white around the neck. Other names seem almost wilfully obscure: what on Earth does the name puffin mean? Or hobby? Why are turtle doves named after reptiles? And don\u2019t get me started on some of the more bizarre bird names found around the world \u2013 from oleaginous hemispingus to zitting cisticola, leaflove to hardhead, and bananaquit to bearded mountaineer. Yet, as I discovered when I was researching my new book on the origins of bird names, if you dig deep enough, you unearth all sorts of fascinating stories about what the names mean, where they came from and, especially, the men and women who created them. The origin of some names may, at first, seem obvious, yet are not quite as straightforward as they appear. Take the simplest of all English bird names: blackbird. It\u2019s a bird, and it\u2019s black. Isn\u2019t that all we need to know? But what about the crow, rook, raven and jackdaw? All of these would have been very familiar to our ancestors, and all appear \u2013 at least from a distance \u2013 to be black in colour. So why was just one species singled out as the \u201cblackbird\u201d? The reason for this apparent anomaly is that, until the late medieval period, birds were not called \u201cbirds\u201d at all, but fowls \u2013 as in Chaucer\u2019s poem The Parliament of Fowls. The word bird (originally the Anglo-Saxon brid), referred only to young fowls, or chicks. Then, sometime around the time Chaucer was writing, this meaning began to shift. From then on, although \u201cfowl\u201d was still used for larger birds such as members of the crow family, \u201cbird\u201d became the norm for all smaller birds, including the blackbird. So, at the time it was named, this really was the only truly \u201cblack bird\u201d. Many of our oldest bird names \u2013 including raven, rook and crow \u2013 are onomatopoeic: they imitate the sound made by the bird itself. Cuckoo, chiffchaff and kittiwake are other well-known examples. Far less obvious ones include nightjar (from the \u201cchurring\u201d sound made by this nocturnal bird), bittern (from its deep, booming call), and the aforementioned turtle dove. \u201cTurtle\u201d is a corruption of the bird\u2019s soft \u201ctur-tur\u201d call, so has nothing to do with the aquatic reptile. Other ancient bird names relate to a bird\u2019s appearance: its size, colour, shape or distinctive markings. Again, some are obvious: such as great spotted woodpecker, blackcap, long-tailed tit and collared dove. But with others it takes some linguistic detective work to uncover their true meaning. Take three familiar birds: the yellowhammer, redstart and wheatear. All three names superficially make sense, yet as soon as you look more closely, they become problematic. After all, the yellowhammer doesn\u2019t have an especially loud or percussive song, redstarts are not noticeably jumpy, and I\u2019ve certainly never seen a wheatear in a field of wheat. The reason these names appear puzzling is down to one of the most important events in British history: the Norman Conquest. Perhaps the greatest change that resulted from this invasion was in our everyday language: within a century or so, Anglo-Saxon had merged with Norman French to create a new, hybrid tongue known as Middle English \u2013 the precursor to the way we speak today. But as the old language fell into disuse, some of its words no longer made any sense. So, by a process called false etymology, people made up new versions, which sounded plausible, even if their original meaning had been lost. One famous non-avian example, the name \u201cdandelion\u201d, is in fact a corruption of the French dent de lion (meaning lion\u2019s tooth, referring to the shape of the plant\u2019s leaves). The same happened with bird names. Thus, the Anglo-Saxon \u201cyellow ammer\u201d (from the German word for a bunting) became yellowhammer; \u201cred steort\u201d (meaning red tail) turned into redstart; and \u201cwheteres\u201d \u2013 literally white arse, changed into wheatear. Norman French also had a major influence on the names of ducks (mallard and wigeon), game birds (pheasant and partridge), and raptors (peregrine and hobby). What these all have in common is that they were important to the Norman nobility \u2013 either as food, or for hunting and sport \u2013 so their French names took precedence over the older, English ones. Hobby, for example, comes from the Old French verb hober \u2013 meaning to jump about \u2013 and refers to this falcon\u2019s dashing, acrobatic flight. The name hobby also played a role in the naming of the table-top football game Subbuteo. The story goes that when the game\u2019s inventor, Peter Adolph, tried to register his idea at the patent office, he wanted to call it Hobby. When a jobsworth official objected, he cleverly substituted the Latin name of his favourite bird, Falco subbuteo, instead. From the 18th century onwards, existing names were codified by professional ornithologists who also coined new ones, such as black-tailed godwit or white-fronted goose. A trend also arose for naming birds after people: sometimes those who had discovered the species, such as George Montagu (Montagu\u2019s harrier). But birds were also named after polar explorers James Clark Ross and Sir John Franklin (Ross\u2019s and Franklin\u2019s gulls), the political radical Thomas Bewick (Bewick\u2019s swan), and the vicar of Selborne, Gilbert White (White\u2019s thrush). As is to be expected, given the patriarchal nature of society at the time, only a handful are named after women. One notable exception is the woman who gave her name to my book: Winifred Moreau, who during the 1930s studied the endemic birds of Tanzania\u2019s Uluguru mountains, with her ornithologist husband, Reg, and after whom one of the world\u2019s rarest birds \u2013 Mrs Moreau\u2019s warbler \u2013 is named. The naming of birds is ultimately a purely human impulse: the birds themselves are, of course, completely unaware of what we choose to call them. Yet, without the wondrous variety of ornithological names, I believe that our world would be a far poorer place. Ultimately, the names we have bestowed on birds down the ages reflect key aspects of our own lives: our primitive superstitions, myths and legends, invasions and conquests, changes in language, rigorous scientific observation, our love of sound, colour and pattern, and a sense of place. Last, but certainly not least, some reflect the extraordinary achievements of the men and women after whom they were called \u2013 including, of course, Winifred Moreau.
