In her first interview since her surprise announcement on Tuesday that she would quit the human rights commission, she told the Guardian that she had been taken aback by the lack of funding when she arrived at the Geneva headquarters more than three years ago. Funding today, she confessed, was little better: \"It is shoe-string. It is a frayed shoe-string.\" The UN, which has been sensitive lately since having its reputation battered by accusations of poor management and bureaucracy, is nervous at the prospect of having such a critic on the outside, especially one with inside knowledge. Its hope is that once Mrs Robinson leaves office her voice will be blunted without an organisation behind her. Cynical speculation within the UN is that she has another big international job lined up, possibly with a group such as Amnesty International. Speaking in Geneva yesterday afternoon, however, she denied having a job in the pipeline and said she was looking for \"an academic position\" that she could use as a base for her campaign. She said her intention was to \"raise the political temperature\" because human rights is so far down the global agenda, and to force UN members states to put up more cash. She was appaled by the employment conditions of so many of the commission's staff, who put their lives at risk every day. \"Most of our staff are on contracts of less than one year. They worry about whether their contracts will be renewed. There is no career structure. I was surprised.\" According to Mrs Robinson, the commission receives only 1.6%, or about \u00a315.5m, of the UN's overall budget. It has a staff of 365: 200 of them are based at the headquarters in Geneva, 15 at UN headquarters in New York and the rest out in the field in places such as Afghanistan, China, Sierra Leone, Colombia, and the West Bank and Gaza. \"We are stressed by trying to do this on too little funding,\" she said. She said only 15 of the field staff, mainly those in Cambodia, were full-time; most of the others were on three- or six-month contracts. Worries about job security were so prevalent, she said, that it was difficult for the organisation to run efficiently. Had money been available, Mrs Robinson said she would have set up a permanent, fast-reaction force to deal with situations such as the discovery of mass graves in Afghanistan. But she will now refocus on the future, free from the commission's heavy workload. \"I am looking forward to being in Ireland more and have time to reflect more than I have. There is a huge set of daily deadlines and reports to approve. There is a relentless quality to the work. But that is not the reason I am leaving. I have never shirked work.\" She told staff on Wednesday morning that, after consideration, she had decided she could better achieve reform by working outside the organisation rather than within it for the next four years. Outspoken on human rights, she antagonised China, Russia, Israel and a host of other countries. She has, however, no regrets about upsetting them. \"I have never felt personally inhibited from saying things.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
