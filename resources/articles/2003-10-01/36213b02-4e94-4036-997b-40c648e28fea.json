Already the longest-serving manager in the Premiership, Ferguson received a formal new contract offer yesterday, the terms of which would take his service to the club beyond the 20-year mark and elevate him ahead of Sven-Goran Eriksson as the best-paid man in the business. The offer was faxed to him via his solicitors before the team flew to Stuttgart for tonight's Champions League tie and he immediately made it clear that he was willing to sign. It followed a seven-hour board meeting at Old Trafford which concluded with the chief executive David Gill finalising a financial package reflecting Ferguson's status as the most successful manager in Britain. Gill has made this his first major project since replacing Peter Kenyon, and the club's continuing financial success has allowed them to push the boat out. Ferguson, whose present deal expires in June 2005, has the option of signing an extension for either two or three years, and his annual salary would leap from a figure in the region of \u00a32.75m to closer to \u00a34m backdated to the start of the season and with improved bonus payments. \"The club have made certain proposals which I received this morning. It's not easy to get excited at my age but the important thing is that this is what I want to do,\" said Ferguson. \"I feel strong and healthy and there is no point retiring when you feel like this. You have to consider how you feel health wise and, secondly, do you still have the motivation? Those are questions I'm comfortable with.\" Ferguson, 61, did not rule out emulating Sir Bobby Robson by staying in the job beyond his 70th birthday. \"I don't have a date in mind but if I still feel good I will consider carrying on,\" he added. He then turned his thoughts to tonight's opponents and admitted he would have preferred to meet the Germans at another time. Stuttgart are top of the Bundesliga, in their best form for years and yet to concede a goal in their first seven league fixtures. It was no surprise that he said he would be satisfied with a draw in the Gottlieb-Daimler Stadium. Stuttgart have combined fluid attacking football with a parsimonious defence. Rudi V\u00f6ller, the Germany coach, has likened the finishing skills of Kevin Kuranyi, a 21-year-old newcomer to the national team, to those of Ruud van Nistelrooy, and if Felix Magath's team keep out Cologne for the first 68 minutes on Saturday Timo Hildebrand will break Oliver Kahn's goalkeeping record of not conceding a league goal in 802 minutes. \"It's going to be a difficult night for us,\" Ferguson said. \"We are seeing the emergence of a great team in Stuttgart so we will need to show what we have learned in Europe over the last few years.\" Ferguson said he had spoken to the Rangers manager Alex McLeish but had taken little encouragement from the Scottish champions' 2-1 win over Stuttgart at Ibrox. \"The roof fell in on Stuttgart that night. Until Rangers scored they never looked in it; Stuttgart had been in total control.\" The French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, linked again with a move to Paris St-Germain, may be on the bench for the first time this season because of an injury to Roy Carroll. But Ferguson reported no other problems and reiterated that Van Nistelrooy would remain their designated penalty-taker despite missing from his last three attempts.
