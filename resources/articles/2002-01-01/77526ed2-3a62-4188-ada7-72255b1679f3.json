You can cry chauvinism if you like, but there's more than national pride to the way I see this year's championship developing. I'll stick my neck out even further: France have the ability to pull off the grand slam, although that may all hinge on England's visit to the Stade de France. Why am I so confident? Firstly, France are performing at a far higher level than last year. Since the summer tour we've seen them play with power and ambition behind a very strong set of forwards. They have everything it takes to compete: a nucleus of seasoned players and a set of enthusiastic youngsters. The turn-around from last year's championship is unbelievable, and it boils down to the choice that faced Bernard Laporte last spring. He had two alternatives: to continue with the players he had, which was a group that clicked from time to time, or bring in the young players - some with fewer than 10 games for their club's first teams - with a view to the 2003 World Cup. It's the young players who have made the difference, guys like Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud, Damien Traille, Thierry Privat, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Michalak and Aur\u00e9lien Rougerie. They have what we call culot , a sort of cheeky courage that means they don't easily become overawed. It will be their biggest asset in the next few weeks. There are other key players: Fabien Galthi\u00e9, for his experience, Tony Marsh for his power, and Peter de Villiers, whose power and speed make him simply the best No3 in the world. Laporte has made other changes. In July he brought in a new forwards coach in Jacques Brunel, who used to coach Pau, and who took Colomiers, a tiny team, to the European Cup final. And the backs coach Bernard Vivies is new as well, a man who likes to see rugby played with panache. Together they've taken the pressure off Laporte a little. Before they arrived he had to see to everything; now he can have more of an overview. The draw is in our favour as well. We will receive England and Ireland, who are the two toughest teams, and that means the most difficult away game will be Wales in Cardiff. England are the best team in the world over a series of matches, but they can be beaten. They are a fabulous team, but they've lost three grand slams by a whisker. And the way France are playing now, we are capable of scoring more tries. France have more players who are able to break through the first line of a defence. Austin Healey, Jonny Wilkinson and Jason Robinson can do that for England but the rest of the team plays in a more organised way, which is also more predictable. They know just what to do, but they don't often deviate from a plan. France are less structured, better able to spring surprises. The young players have brought us la folie , but it's creative madness. In terms of our progress towards the World Cup, the principal objective will be to beat England. We've lost to them for the past three years, so it's about time we put that right. Because England are the reference point in the northern hemisphere, and we've seen off South Africa and Australia in the last year and a bit, beating les rosbifs would show that Laporte is just where he wants to be. Even if we do lose the tournament, getting the best of the English would be fair compensation. This is my final championship table: France, England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Italy. Now its up to les bleus to prove me right. PS: I'd just like to express my thanks to the ERC appeal board for reversing the decision to suspend my friend Ismaela Lassissi. It raises another question, however. Just how professional must the whole saga have looked to an outsider? Still, they made the right decision in the end.
