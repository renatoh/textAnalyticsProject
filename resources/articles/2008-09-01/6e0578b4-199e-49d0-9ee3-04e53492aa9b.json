For instance, until last Friday, \u00a358.80 would buy a Chesterfield resident nearly five working hours in London using a Saver ticket. Now that trip requires a new \"Off-Peak\" ticket that costs 17% more. Those not wanting to pay more will find only a \"Super Off-Peak\" ticket - which allows less than three working hours in London. While I can understand why a cash-strapped government would connive with the rail industry to dilute fare regulation, it's difficult to understand why the groups claiming to represent passenger interests are happy to turn a blind eye to this crude trickery. John Geddes Winster, Derbyshire The train operating companies seem to have no motivation other than maximising profit and the introduction of the new fare system has given them ample opportunity to extend their profiteering. In 2001 I travelled on a regular basis from Blackpool to Frome on a Saver return for \u00a345. I'm astonished to look at the fare structures today for the same journey and find that the cheapest option is \u00a381 (an Off-peak return). The much-vaunted option of two cheap singles is \u00a3130 for the two tickets, regardless of how far in advance they are booked. And the most amusing or tragic aspect of this fare structure is the chance to buy an Anytime First return via London for \u00a3501. I could travel to New York and back for the same amount.
