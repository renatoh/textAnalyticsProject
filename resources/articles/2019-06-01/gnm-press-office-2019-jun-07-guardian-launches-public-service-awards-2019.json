The annual awards showcase projects, teams and individuals making a real difference to people\u2019s lives. The Guardian Public Service Awards are free to enter and are open to all those working in the UK\u2019s public services, whether in a public body, private firm or voluntary organisation. There are 12 categories in total, which this year includes two new awards; \u2018climate champions\u2019, which will celebrate a public service project or team that has made real strides in demonstrating environmental excellence, while \u2018workforce wellbeing\u2019 will be awarded to an outstanding project that has supported the health and wellbeing of staff working in public service. A panel of external experts and Guardian public service journalists will assess the entries for this year\u2019s awards and also draw up the shortlist for the public servant of the year award, which will open to a public vote in October. David Brindle, public services editor and panel chair, Guardian News &amp; Media said: \u201cAusterity has put the dedication of public service workers to the test \u2013 and they haven\u2019t been found wanting. Excellent public services are the hallmark of a civilised society. They exemplify our core values of mutuality, fairness and common decency. As long as we can still point to such services, and tip our hats to them, we can be sure that we haven\u2019t wholly lost our way.\u201d Entries for the Guardian Public Service Awards close on 15 July 2019 and the winners will be announced at the end of November at a ceremony in London. A full list of categories and criteria, including information on how to enter can be found here. -Ends- For more information please contact: publicservicesawards@theguardian.com Notes to editors About Guardian News &amp; Media Guardian News &amp; Media (GNM) publishes theguardian.com, one of the world\u2019s leading English-language newspaper websites.
