On the strength of its songs, it\u2019s hard not to see it as a cynical vehicle for her newfound primetime position on the US version of The Voice and her high-profile relationship with fellow judge Blake Shelton: they are weaker than a hinge on one of those swivel chairs. A team of Sia/Katy Perry/Adele hitmakers have been drafted in to forklift Stefani\u2019s sound to similar heights, but the result is a familiar storyboard of proven radio formulas: Bieberish dancehall-house on Send Me a Picture, Zedd-aping tropical disco-house on Rare; Make Me Like You lives by the disco stomp you\u2019ve heard everywhere since Get Lucky and the popular trap trimmings reign supreme, as on the Fetty Wap-adorned Asking 4 It. Only reggae-lite skank Where Would I Be hints at Stefani\u2019s once playful personality. But the truth is that this feels like little more than careerist chart fodder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
