While the chairman Charles Koppel says the club will go bankrupt if they do not make the switch - they are due to move into a new 28,000 capacity stadium there in time for the start of the 2003-04 season - the fans want a return to a local stadium as the alternative to ending the ground share with Crystal Palace. This afternoon they will take their campaign to the streets with a march before the First Division game against Birmingham City. Leaflets opposing any move out of London will be distributed and a petition circulated, which they hope Birmingham fans will also sign. Banners will be unfurled inside the ground and just before kick-off dozens of black balloons released. Afterwards fans will be asked to remain behind to try and force Koppel to address them. They are also planning to hit the club financially by refusing to buy merchandise and programmes. Former Wimbledon players such as Chris Perry, Vinnie Jones, Laurie Sanchez and Dickie Guy have declared their opposition to the move and the fans appear to have found a potentially powerful ally in David Burns, the chief executive of the Football League, who has said Wimbledon should investigate the possibility of a return to Merton. \"The general principles of the league have always applied that a club should play its football in its natural home,\" Burns said. \"Wimbledon have moved from their natural home and one of the things the league will do - and I have already written to the council - is to find out why they can't go back to their natural home.\" For its part Merton council, in the guise of its leader Andrew Judge, has called for the league to reject the Milton Keynes move and look into what Wimbledon have done to \"find a new stadium closer to Merton and within the M25\". The league wants to make sure there are no alternatives within the club's present area and although Koppel claims the search for other sites in south London has been exhausted, the Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association says that it has identified four possible locations. Wisa, led by Kris Stewart, is to commission feasibility studies into the sites. Stewart plans to present the findings to the Football League board, which meets next week to discuss the matter. Burns has already assured Stewart that the board will examine Wisa's sites carefully and consider the fans views before making any decision. Stewart said finding alternative locations was crucial to Wisa's campaign. \"We have had to find alternative sites within the south London area because the club is not looking,\" he said, adding that several experts, such as property lawyers and surveyors, had offered to help. \"We will present our findings to the league and blow Koppel's arguments out of the water. We are confident that we will find a site suitable for a new ground.\" Wisa has been drumming up support from fans' groups around the country and has also won the backing of local MPs, the local council, London's mayor Ken Livingstone. It hopes to meet the sports minister Richard Caborn in the next few weeks. A fighting fund has been created and a briefing document, outlining Wisa's position and countering Koppel's arguments, drawn up. The fans are digging in for a long campaign. Stewart said: \"We have to counter the message the club has been putting out and feel we are at last doing that. We are going to protest at every match until Koppel withdraws his plans. This is going to be hard battle.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
