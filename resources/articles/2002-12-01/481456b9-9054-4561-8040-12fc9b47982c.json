The Lambourn trainer and his big-race jockey Mick Fitzgerald combined to put punters in a festive mood yesterday with five well supported winners at Newbury. And hours earlier, as his stable staff made their way to the gallops, a bitter Berkshire dawn had them in full north-pole gear for the first time this winter, complete with long johns, ear muffs and woolly mittens. Looking ahead to the King George - and heartened by the Kempton clerk of the course's gloomy personal forecast for \"more rain\" - Henderson spoke of Bacchanal's \"talented but somewhat kinky\" style and admitted he has tried every trick in the book to iron out the creases in his jumping - without success. He said: \"Bacchanal's habit of jumping right has been well documented. We have tried prickers [a pinching piece of tackle to discourage heading off a straight line], different bridles and new bits and nothing has worked. \"Watch him jump in the indoor school and you would never think he had a problem. He is as straight as a gun barrel at every fence and we just cannot get him to deviate, but as soon as he sets foot on a racecourse he has a brainstorm and goes violently right at almost every obstacle. \"Both Mick and I are totally bemused. It has even confused our brilliant horse master, Yogi Breisner, who is at a loss about how to put things right as Bacchanal is so foot-perfect in his homework. It's in his head - if only horses could talk!\" At least the clockwise Kempton course is the right way round for the eccentric jumper, as the presence of the rail discourages any inwards kink, but ideally Bacchanal wants a stiffer test of stamina than its flat three miles. The form book also suggests that the 5-1 second-favourite with Coral will have his work cut out to reverse last year's King George form with Florida Pearl (7-1) and Best Mate (11-8), having been beaten three parts of a length and six by that pair 12 months ago. Henderson accepts it will be a battle and acknowledges his eight-year-old \"won't improve any\" and that \"only the weather can help us\". He added: \"It was good ground last year, and every drop of rain that falls between now and Boxing Day has to be in our favour. Best Mate is a more natural jumper than we are, but on soft ground we might be able to draw the sting out of him. \"I hope the Kempton drains are blocked and that the sprinklers jam, because this is our Gold Cup - at Cheltenham in March we'll be heading for the Stayers' Hurdle, where Bacchanal's jumping problems are not quite so costly as they are over fences. \"I would love to win a King George - Remittance Man ought to have won 11 years ago - and Bacchanal, who sailed through rehearsals over hurdles at Newbury last month, has never been better.\" Nor is Bacchanal the only string to the stable's bow in the big race and Henderson warned: \"While we have still to decide on a jockey for Marlborough, that one is by no means a bit-player either.\" And what of the fears that Kempton will shortly scrap jump racing in favour of a lucrative all-weather track? \"Don't get me on my soap-box again,\" he said. \"My ideal Christmas present would be an envelope containing the shredded plans for their dirt course. Kempton drains so well and they provide good ground all the year round. We cannot afford to lose it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
