In a letter in today's Guardian, the presidents of associations representing six of the biggest surgical disciplines claim \"patients attend their GP surgeries with conditions that can be effectively treated by surgery and are being turned away\". Some of the patients may not even be told that an operation could help their problem, the surgeons say. Even when the sick are referred to a hospital consultant they can be refused operations because trusts have \"arbitrarily defined a number of operations that reduce pain, improve quality of life and prevent serious long-term complications as being of 'limited clinical value'\". Individual health trusts are allowed to make decisions about the provision of treatments to reflect the needs of the local population, but surgeons say medical procedures ranging from those aimed at tackling back pain and common hernias to bone-anchored hearing aids and varicose vein removal are being simultaneously scrapped across the NHS. The list of treatments exactly mirrors those procedures that management consultants McKinsey said the NHS should \"decommission\" to save \u00a3700m in a report commissioned by the Department of Health last year. Surgeons claim cost-cutting lies at the heart of moves to \"ration patient care\". Last week the Department of Health revealed a new age of austerity in the NHS \u2013 signalling that trusts would have to save \u00a31.5bn by reducing \"unnecessary prescriptions and hospital referrals\". The situation is already critical said Alan Johnson, the president of ENT UK which represents surgeons who specialise in the ear, nose and throat. In a straw poll this month, ENT surgeons said 30 trusts had restricted simple procedures \"which they would not fund\". Johnson said what would in the past have been considered routine surgeries for removing ear glue in small children and taking out tonsils have been \"withdrawn effectively from the health service. These procedures have been classified as of low clinical value. But a child who cannot hear has his or her development impaired. Acute tonsillitis in the worst case can see patients admitted to emergency wards which is much more expensive than removing their tonsils.\" In orthopaedics, common surgeries such as knee replacements and carpal tunnel syndrome are habitually refused. Michael Bell, president of the British Orthopaedic Association, said: \"Both conditions are treatable. But now we hear that knee replacements only relieve pain for 80% of patients after six months. Apparently that is not a good enough outcome. Same for releasing trapped nerves. The decision for what is clinically necessary is made without consulting surgeons.\" The underlying concern, says Bell, is surgeries have been curtailed both to save costs and to meet the patients' guarantees of the new health service constitution, which comes into force this week and mandates patients to be treated within 18 weeks of their referral to a hospital by a GP. \"We deliver 60,000 [elective surgery] episodes a month \u2026 but 40% of trusts won't hit the treatment within 18 weeks target in the new NHS constitution. So trusts are trying to delay referrals from GPs. Otherwise patients could go to the courts and seek judicial review of a decision. But you can't review a decision when you have not been referred to a consultant.\" In the letter the surgeons say that everyone who works in the NHS is aware of \"the serious financial crisis facing public services\". \"Service cuts are being made without public consultation and the responsibility for informing patients denied treatment is being left at the doors of doctors.\" Opposition parties say the government has long known of financial pressures building up in the health service but tries to hide the extent of the problem. Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrats health spokesman, said the surgeons' concerns were \"cuts by stealth\". \"These are quietly being done by trusts without any sense of the evidence behind it,\" he said. \"They are trying to save millions of pounds but this is not the way to address the financial crisis in the NHS.\" Some primary care trusts are already heavily overspent. A Guardian investigation this month revealed that dozens of trusts were in the red and some had already begun cutting back on treatments. In London, the capital's assembly two weeks ago warned health trust deficits had now topped \u00a385m \"considerably more than the \u00a372 million total of trusts and PCTs [primary care trusts] were in deficit at the end of in 2008/09\". The Department of Health last night said there were numerous examples of surgical procedures that have been superseded by either medication or better operations. Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of the NHS, said: \"Good surgery is about fine judgments which ensure that each patient gets the right operation for them. \"This means continually reappraising the relative effectiveness of old, new and emerging options, whilst recognising that an operation which is suitable for one patient may not be suitable for another with different medical or personal circumstances. seems inconceivable that any PCT or even the Department of Health would unilaterally draw up a definitive list of apparently ineffective procedures without a clear consensus from surgeons who are experts in the field.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
