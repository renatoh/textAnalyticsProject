City beat Ipswich 4-1 at Portman Road to earn their manager a trip back to the club he managed from 1992-97 and played for in the early 80s. It will be the first time Keegan has taken a club to St James' since he resigned in January 1997. It is the outstanding tie of a last 16 which pairs only two Premiership clubs, with Middlesbrough given a home game against Blackburn after their win against Manchester United on Saturday. Rovers knocked Steve McClaren's team out of the Worthington Cup in October. Cheltenham's reward for their impressive defeat of Burnley was a visit to West Bromwich, another First Division club, who have knocked out two Premiership sides in Sunderland and Leicester. Arsenal, last season's beaten finalists, should enjoy a straightforward passage to the quarter-finals after being drawn at home to Gillingham or Bristol Rovers, whose tie was postponed. Walsall, who managed a notable giant-killing act on Saturday by winning at Charlton, are at home to Premiership Fulham. Tottenham or Bolton will be at home to Tranmere Rovers, which means the Spurs manager Glenn Hoddle could come face to face with the team who came from three goals down to defeat his Southampton side in the fifth round last season. Chelsea or West Ham, who replay at Upton Park, will be at home to Preston, twice winners of the competition, though not since 1938. Everton, who last lifted the trophy in 1995, face First Division Crewe at Goodison Park. But the Newcastle v Manchester City game will draw most attention and Stuart Pearce, a former Newcastle player who was part of City's success at Ipswich, was clearly looking forward to the visit. \"We have got one or two connections,\" he said. \"The manager is obviously the main connection. I'm sure he'll love going back with the ovation he'll get.\" Fifth-round draw Tottenham Hotspur or Bolton Wanderers v Tranmere Rovers Newcastle United v Manchester City Arsenal v Gillingham or Bristol Rovers Chelsea or West Ham United v Preston North End Middlesbrough v Blackburn Rovers Everton v Crewe Alexandra Walsall v Fulham West Bromwich Albion v Cheltenham Town Ties to be played on the weekend of Feb 16/17."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
