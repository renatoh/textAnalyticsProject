Andersen\u2019s chilly fable, brightened for a modern audience with original songs and a narrative spin that put the relationship between two sisters at its core, was renamed Frozen. At its premiere in 2013, Disney\u2019s chief executive, Bob Iger, wept behind his 3D glasses. And why not? Within weeks the movie had made more than $800m in worldwide bums-on-seats. Its soundtrack was No1. The DVD sold 3m copies in a day. Though a sequel has been slow in coming \u2013 Frozen II is in cinemas later this month \u2013 it has been an absolute inevitability, ever since somebody, somewhere, bought the clinching ticket or disc and Frozen moved past The Lion King to become the most successful animated film of all time. I was the father of a new baby girl when the Frozen madness began, back in 2013. In the tiny gaps between ninja nappy-wrapping and sprinting out on emergency Persil runs to the shops, I was vaguely aware of the arrival of a cultural phenomenon. I didn\u2019t know the specifics, nothing of the heroine-princess Elsa, her younger sister Anna, their gang of comic friends or their quest to save a frozen Scandinavian kingdom from ruin. I hadn\u2019t heard any of the songs which, people said, were wilier and more mischievous than the straighter, soapier, we\u2019re-in-love-now ballads that defined Disney movies past. My first exposure to the curious potency of Frozen\u2019s soundtrack came that first summer after its release. I had been sent to interview a footballer. When I arrived at his home he was running late, and I was parked in the kitchen with his children, who were playing the soundtrack on a loop. And I mean loop. This music, plainly, was as much a fixture of the home as the unliftable art books and nice rugs. One of the tracks, For The First Time In Forever, caught my ear. In the song, the two sisters consider a glamorous upcoming ball from two perspectives. Anna, the fun sister, can\u2019t wait: \u201cDon\u2019t know if I\u2019m elated or gassy,\u201d she sings, \u201cbut I\u2019m somewhere in that zo-o-o-ne!\u201d Elsa, secretly cursed with the power to shoot ice from her hands, is terrified: \u201cConceal! Don\u2019t feel! Put on a sho-o-o-w!\u201d I was amazed at how much character was packed into one short, pert song; how touching and unself-pitying it was. I went away intrigued, though not expecting to find out much more about Frozen for at least another 15 years, at which age my daughter, having been raised on a diet of leather-bound Dickens and Bunraku mime, would be allowed to watch her first Hollywood film. We trick ourselves, any time we think we can curate a careful menu of things our kids will obsess over. Before my daughter was born, I had this idea it might be neat if I chose a pop song for her. The first piece of music her little ears would hear! I would play it as soon as we got her back from the hospital. As it was, in the cab taking us home, the driver slapped on the radio, we got Fuck You by Cee-Lo Green, and that was that. Frozen was also my fault. We were days into a rained-off holiday in the countryside and the place had a DVD player plus a copy of the film. What could it hurt? I brought in snacks. Arranged cushions. We sat and watched the thing, and she surprised me, when the baddie did an embarrassing bad-guy dance, by gurgling out a laugh. I could almost see the mental connections fusing, that weird human delight taking shape in the interplay between humiliation and amusement. Before long we had watched Frozen a second time, then a third. It became one of our things. \u201cFer-zen,\u201d she called it. Recently I spoke to the movie\u2019s co-directors, Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, about this. I was not the first to offer \u201cFrozen dad\u201d feedback: Lee described the gruff, unimpressible, fortysomething men who would come bounding up, \u201cbreathlessly, saying things like, \u2018Anna loves too much. That\u2019s her problem. And that\u2019s her strength.\u2019\u201d Buck said: \u201cFathers and daughters are the fans I find most fascinating. The dads enjoy the movie on its own merits, but it gives them a connection with their daughters they may not have had before. A way in.\u201d Ten viewings, 15. In these early innocent stages (mere foothills of a coming obsession), my daughter seemed to like the wacky supporting characters best: a brought-to-life snowman, Olaf, waddling about at waist height; a lonely mountain-man, Kristoff, who gets a little song about preferring his pet reindeer to people. The film\u2019s final song features musical trolls who band together for a topsy-turvy dance number about learning to tolerate people\u2019s flaws. These trolls, I eventually noticed, somewhere around the 20th or 25th viewing, had been snuck a cheeky line in which they speculated that Kristoff and his reindeer enjoyed a relationship \u201ca little outside of nature\u2019s laws\u201d. Of all the un-Disneyish subjects: bestiality. I must have gasped. \u201cWhat? What?\u201d my daughter asked, while I winced and bit my tongue. Here was that flattering sense, well known to parent-chaperones at Pixar movies, of a gag aimed over the heads of the kids for the grownups. Elsewhere in Frozen, in a patch of apparently innocent repartee, the film-makers slipped in a penis joke. Anna is asked about a prospective boyfriend\u2019s foot size, and snaps back: \u201cFoot size doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I asked Lee and Buck whether there\u2019d been any debate about this and Lee roared. \u201cDid not debate it at all. We were improv-ing in the room and the line just came out\u2026 You\u2019re the first person to bring that up.\u201d I could hardly bring myself to admit just how many times I\u2019d seen the film. Forty? Fifty? I knew it backwards. I had half the dance moves. There was obvious pride, for these film-makers, that their Frozen should ever have ridden the zeitgeist like this. An initial pitch, in 2008 or 2009, that Elsa and Anna did not need boyfriend-saviours and might in fact save themselves, must have sounded pretty revolutionary in Disney\u2019s Burbank studios. (I\u2019m thinking Lenin pitching the Russians: no more tsars.) But Buck and Lee got the idea through and the resulting film turns on a moment of familial, not romantic, love. Kristoff and an oily prince called Hans yap about, gesturing at being the hero, before winding up as arm candy for Anna, an irrelevance to Elsa. I had some beautiful chats with my daughter about this. As she grew up and changed, the world was changing, too. Often, when our larger talks stuttered, it was Frozen and its intimately known beats that we referred back to. The movie became something like a demonstration table, from which colourful examples from life could be picked up and placed down. \u201cSo you know how Anna starts off thinking that getting married to Hans is the only thing that matters\u2026?\u201d \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d As with a great many Disney movies, the plot of Frozen requires that the lead characters be orphans. In order to keep the plot brisk and economical, the parents die early, in a shipwreck. This happens mid-song, their ship going down under a wave during a storm. Lee explained that they didn\u2019t want to linger on a \u201cBambi moment\u201d. Watching through adult eyes, I always found this a deft piece of storytelling. It never occurred to me that my daughter had missed anything, not til our 45th or 50th viewing came to an end, with the winter-struck kingdom returned to sunshine and prosperity. There had been more and more talk, online, about a Frozen sequel. I asked my daughter, idly, what she thought would happen next to the sisters. She yawned, throwing out her lengthening limbs into a massive, contented, after-movie stretch. She said something about Elsa and Anna\u2019s parents finally getting home from their sea voyage. Silence on the sofa. The credits rolled. \u201cOh, baby,\u201d I began. Deep breath. And so we had our first conversation about death. *** Frozen mugs. Frozen T-shirts. Frozen Crayola. Frozen Lego. As of autumn-winter 2014, brides have been able to walk down the aisle in an authorised Frozen wedding dress, in ivory or in Elsa\u2019s trademark turquoise. Around the time that Frozen\u2019s turnover passed the $1bn mark, with Disney stock soaring, chief executive Iger went on an open call to investors and promised Frozen video games, Frozen theme park attractions, \u201cnot just new product but continued interest and continued impact on the bottom line for quite a while\u201d. Across America, a lottery system had to be introduced, to deal with the extent of shops\u2019 demand for merch. Lee, who had cast her daughter in a small role in the movie (voicing a nine-year-old Anna), went out shopping one day and came across a miniature Frozen tandem. When you pressed a button on the basket, an excerpt of her daughter\u2019s singing voice crackled out. At Disney\u2019s Florida theme park they got an Anna and Elsa-themed log flume. In the California park, they got an Anna and Elsa\u2019s Boutique. After a couple of Christmases as a Frozen parent, I was living in what amounted to an Anna and Elsa\u2019s Boutique myself. Pencil case. Indoor football. Bedspread with matching pillowcase. We had affiliated Frozen tat of every conceivable size, purpose and quality, from tiny, self-assembly characters out of Kinder eggs to solid plastic figurines, heavy as murder weapons, that presented Anna in two \u201clooks\u201d, her ball look and her winter travelling look. There was an official Frozen picture book and some unofficial Frozen lip salve. Prized above everything, by my daughter, was a cloaked Elsa dress. It came with Elsa gloves, an Elsa wand and an Elsa braid. For her fourth birthday, we were able to find an inflatables guy who had painted a plausible Elsa on his bouncy castle and was touring it, one step ahead of the patent lawyers, I expect, around kids\u2019 parties. My daughter came in character, as Elsa. A dozen other little girls came in character, all as Elsas. On the way home, I asked her what the deal was with Elsa: \u201cShe\u2019s cursed. She never smiles. Anna\u2019s the fun one! Why does nobody ever dress up as Anna?\u201d It made no sense. Anna was witty, gutsy. Elsa was surly. I asked Frozen\u2019s songwriters, Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, a married couple who\u2019d written the music and lyrics in a tiny office above a Greek bakery in Brooklyn. Kristen had noticed the Elsa-Anna imbalance, too, counting the kids who came by their house every Halloween and putting the ratio at 12:1. She shrugged. \u201cElsa is sparkly. Otherworldly. Anna is only human.\u201d One day, recently, I called up Elsa herself \u2013 the actor Idina Menzel, a big-voiced Broadway veteran (Rent, Wicked) who was in her early 40s when she was cast as Frozen\u2019s lead in 2012. Menzel was in the middle of recording an album of Christmas songs when we spoke. She admitted that, growing up, she wasn\u2019t much of a fan of Disney princesses. \u201cBut don\u2019t tell them that. I think Disney\u2019s gotten a lot better, since then, at making empowering female characters.\u201d As for Elsa\u2019s strange magnetism, Menzel puts it down to the fact that Elsa, as with many young women, has too often been told what not to do. Casual and funny, a fortysomething with dark hair, the actor does not share many surface qualities with Elsa, a buttoned-up Scandinavian ice-teen. But, Menzel says, \u201cI can relate. When I was young, I had this bi-i-i-g voice. People would talk about it, say I had a gift, yet I didn\u2019t want to show it off, in case people thought I was bragging. So you end up taking a strength and burying it. That\u2019s not something that goes away. As women we work on it all the time. We\u2019re always wrestling with, \u2018How much is too much? How big is too big?\u2019 When you speak your mind, your anger, your ferocity \u2013 when is that OK, when is that allowed, as a woman?\u201d In the first half of Frozen, audiences watch Elsa suppress her ice powers until a supreme second-act song called Let It Go. At this point she abruptly stops giving a hoot and, whipping off her gloves, letting down her hair, she conjures up an ice fortress, a snow demon, plus a cool new frosty disco dress. From the earliest screenings, it was clear to all that Let It Go was Frozen\u2019s centrepiece triumph, its money-maker and access-all-areas pass, eventual winner of an Oscar for Best Song and a Grammy. The Lopezes told me they first wrote it under the working title of Elsa\u2019s Badass Moment, while walking in a Brooklyn park. The song had to express a release of pent-up, unsayable truths. Kristen channelled some of the frustrations she had at the time, \u201craising a two-year-old and a six-year-old, trying to have a career, trying to have a good marriage, trying to stay skinny. Expectations can be so high, for what we are allowed to be. I thought, what would happen if I just let all that go?\u201d Days after Frozen\u2019s release, at a time when the lunatic power of Let It Go was starting to become plain, Disney fed a coming craze by putting the unabridged song on YouTube. It has since been viewed 675m times. A month later, a singalong version went live, complete with lyrics and bouncing snowflake. An absurd 1.8bn views. Taylor Swift covered Let It Go on tour, as did Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, another Frozen dad. Every night on Broadway, before curtain-up on Frozen The Musical (which opened in 2018), audiences have to be patiently reminded not to hum along. The karaoke company Lucky Voice said that Let It Go was its most-sung track of 2015. And 2016. And 2017. The song has become a gay anthem; Elsa, in turn, has been taken up as a (possibly) gay icon. You suspect this rather caught Disney off-guard, the studio having been timorous, to say the least, about representing a diverse sexuality in its family movies. In the summer of 2016, an online campaign began, calling on Disney to #GiveElsaAGirlfriend in any future sequel. The studio had been praised, in 2013, for letting a princess off their conveyor belt without an attached boyfriend. Clearly there was an opportunity to break new ground in 2019, with Frozen II, and a small hint seemed to be dropped when Disney publicised a still from the sequel during Pride month, showing Elsa in a purple dress. Accustomed to using Frozen as a launchpad for all sorts of parent-child discussions, I pencilled in an opportunity for another landmark chat with my daughter. So, I asked co-directors Buck and Lee, what was the plan? How had they responded to Elsa becoming a gay icon? There was a pause. \u201cWell, y\u2019know,\u201d Buck began \u2013 and I sensed a careful workshopped answer coming. \u201cFor Elsa, it\u2019s all about the importance of family and, y\u2019know, the strength of that. And we\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019re staying in that lane.\u201d He meant, in the sequel, Elsa would #NotBeGettingAGirlfriend. Lee cut in: \u201cBut what we love is that people see themselves in her, [especially] anyone who feels that they have a part of themselves that needs release.\u201d Who knows? Future instalments of the franchise might go to braver places. There have been plans to keep taking the story further. When I spoke to Menzel, she had just been on a night out with her co-star Jonathan Groff, the voice of mountain-man Kristoff. Groff had described the first movie as a seed and the second movie as a sprout. Something like that. Menzel couldn\u2019t quite remember. She paused our conversation and took out her phone. \u201cI\u2019m gonna text him right now. Hold on there. I\u2019m texting Kristoff while we speak.\u201d After many journeys on the fixed rails of Frozen\u2019s plot, there was something so thrillingly off-book about a text pinging between Elsa and Kristoff that I could hardly sit still. I wondered what my daughter would make of it. Menzel chuckled. \u201cTell your daughter \u2018Hi\u2019 from me. Tell her some old lady with dark brown hair says \u2018Hi\u2019. That\u2019ll freak her out.\u201d I said I would. *** The Lopezes have a story about how they were once in a Disney store before Christmas, queueing to buy Frozen toys with everybody else. Their songs were playing on an endless loop out of a speaker and when the Lopezes got to the front of the queue, hoping to curry favour with the server and perhaps get some sort of discount, they mentioned they\u2019d written Let It Go. The server looked at them, as the songs played and played, and asked: \u201cWhy?\u201d Robert told me: \u201cAt first our friends and neighbours used to say, \u2018Thank you for writing these songs, you\u2019ve brought our family together.\u2019 And then\u2026\u201d He laughed. \u201cAnd then it started to shift.\u201d His wife, Kristen, referred to something she called \u201cmini-van fatigue\u201d: too many road journeys, too many restarts of the CD. When I asked Lee about the most common parental response to her movie now, she answered drily: \u201cFrozen has cost me a lot of money.\u201d Rising levels of parental ennui present a challenge, as these film-makers prepare to release their sequel. \u201cWe had to start with a question,\u201d Kristen said. \u201cWhy do Frozen II at all?\u201d When she said this, an answer sprang to my mind, and it ended with nine zeros. But the Lopezes said they were most intrigued by the challenge of ageing a group of obsessed-over characters. Lee told me that, before writing the script, she plunged into books about Elizabeth I\u2019s reign, seeking ideas about where to take Elsa next. She was looking over the heads of the kids who might have come and gone as Frozen fans, eyeballing the next generation. \u201cBefore the first Frozen, I asked myself: what did I wish had been there for me as a child? And it was a heroine who was not perfect, who struggled, who wasn\u2019t good or evil, and wasn\u2019t pitted against other women. Same with Frozen II. I sat down and thought, what would have helped?\u201d Lopez mentioned geopolitics in this context. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been through crises in the last few years,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an anxiety level we all share. We wanted to show how our characters would deal with that, too.\u201d I wasn\u2019t able to see the sequel but \u2013 just a guess \u2013 look out for set-piece songs in which Elsa refreezes the melting icecaps. Anna votes Elizabeth Warren. Olaf gets Brexit done. Or maybe not. Disney will not want too many risks taken with its golden franchise. In spring this year, the company announced that Frozen The Musical would open around the world, in Sydney, Hamburg and London. Meanwhile building work was under way on a Frozen realm at Disneyland Paris, a deal that elicited an excited tweet from President Macron. Plans were announced to sell Frozen coding kits. A Frozen quad bike. Back on Broadway, they sold their millionth ticket. I went along, ducking in to see the musical during a work trip. While a real-life Elsa roamed the stage, her ice powers simulated with flashing lights and dry ice, I did my best to watch it through my daughter\u2019s eyes. I wanted to remember all the tiny details, to ferry them back to her in London. I could hardly wait. She had just turned six. We\u2019d been Frozen nuts, together, for more than half her life. I used to think that, because of her, I had seen Frozen more times than any other movie. More recently I\u2019d begun to wonder if I\u2019d seen Frozen more times than all other movies put together. There was no longer a question of irritation or fatigue: Frozen was simply a fact of parenting life, same as getting up early, having a sore back, worrying. It was while I was away in New York that my daughter was taken to see Matilda in London. Her first West End show! This came after a summer of fascination with the Women\u2019s World Cup, reading The Worst Witch books and liking Wonder Woman. When I got home, she listened politely to my stories about Frozen The Musical, then went back to recreating the big number from Matilda, the one about kids who are desperate to get on and grow up. One day she came to find me, with the air of someone who\u2019d been sitting on a big confession for a while. Deep breath. She admitted she\u2019d started to find Frozen boring. Babyish. She would come and see the sequel with me (a concession to my feelings). But the fact was she had other favourites. We hugged. I thought of the time she first teetered away, walking, or spent a whole morning at nursery by herself \u2013 fantastic new beginnings that also marked, unequivocally, an end. I needed to vent some of this to wiser ears. Who better than the songwriting Lopezes, emotionally nimble enough to stuff one single film with the biggest pop song of the decade (Let It Go), a masterpiece of musical storytelling (For The First Time In Forever) and a sneaky joke about bestiality? I explained that my daughter had pushed through the other side, gone post-Frozen. Was it weird that I felt so distraught? \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable,\u201d Kristen said. \u201cWe had the same. Our daughters were so in love with the first movie. Then they grew up. They got obsessed with Hamilton. Our eldest is 14 now and into Billie Eilish and YouTube ukulele stars.\u201d They tried to write some of these anxieties into songs for the sequel, Robert said. \u201cAbout growing. Going into the unknown. Facing some of the fears we all have around change.\u201d The family had just that week been to a screening of Frozen II, Kristen said. It turned out that even the 14-year-old Billie Eilish fan could get back into Anna and Elsa for a night. \u201cWe talked about it the whole car ride home,\u201d Kristen said. \u201cThey\u2019re kind, sweet girls. But, yeah, they\u2019re on their own paths now. And the fact that we got 45 minutes of their warmth, again, that was\u2026 That was a very nice thing.\u201d \u2022 Frozen II is out on 22 November.
