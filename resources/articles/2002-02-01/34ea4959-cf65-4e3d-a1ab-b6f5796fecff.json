But Lancashire, who stripped Crawley of the captaincy at the end of last season, are short of experienced batsmen following Mike Atherton's retirement and are refusing to accept the 30-year-old's notice. The chief executive Jim Cumbes has referred the matter to the England and Wales Cricket Board, insisting yesterday: \"John is still under contract and this is a matter we hope to resolve.\" Cumbes also denied Crawley's claims that he had been told to stay away from the club by the new cricket manager, Mike Watkinson. However the former England batsman, speaking on BBC radio last night, described the county's decision to go to Lord's as \"a little surprising really. With what's happened, from my point of view, it's extremely difficult to motivate myself, and it's going to remain so. It does seem to be a total breakdown and an impasse situation. \"I consider myself no longer a [Lancashire] player although I do understand that Lancashire may have the right to appeal my decision to a higher body.\" The start of the first Test series to be played on neutral territory, meanwhile, proved a box-office disaster yesterday as only a few dozen fans turned up at the 22,000-capacity Sharjah stadium to see Pakistan recover from a slow start to reach 230 for five against West Indies. The Pakistan Cricket Board moved the series, comprising two Tests and three one-dayers, after the West Indies refused to travel to Pakistan because of security concerns. Pakistan quickly slipped to 94 for four but 53 from Younis Khan and an undefeated 78 by Yousuf Youhana steadied the ship. \"We allowed the game to drift in the final session in particular,\" said the West Indies captain Carl Hooper, who took two for 31. \"We didn't bowl that well and our fielding wasn't up the mark.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
