It transcends costume drama with the hallucinations and delusions of the sick scientist (Paul Bettany) with an illness that also kills his favourite child. At times, it resembles The Singing Detective, also directed by Amiel all those years ago. The nature footage and the illustrated tales he tells the kids are brilliantly pulled off. This adds a layer of meaning to the central, well known science v God dilemma, which troubled Darwin's religious wife."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
