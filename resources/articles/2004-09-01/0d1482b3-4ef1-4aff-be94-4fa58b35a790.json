The extent of the damage to America is being assessed after Ivan hit Alabama on Thursday, weakening to a tropical depression as it continued across the state, with hurricane-force winds, heavy rainfall and flooding still a concern, and tornadoes predicted in eastern Georgia and western North Carolina. Tropical Storm Jeanne's path over northern Hispaniola threatened hurricanes in destinations including Bahamas and Turks &amp; Caicos. On Grenada 90 per cent of houses were damaged and half destroyed, and most hotels are still closed. A spokeswoman for Grenada Board of Tourism said most should be open by the end of the year. Direct flights from the UK have not yet resumed, but shuttle flights from Barbados are running. Abta spokesman Keith Betton said: 'In most cases bookings won't be taken until the end of October, but that might be put back to January while tour operators assess what needs doing and hotels are repaired.' Kuoni has redirected Grenada bookings until 31 October and will not take more to the island until then. Virgin Holidays will not sell it until January. Clients due to visit will be moved to Tobago or elsewhere. In the Cayman Islands telecommunications are still down, and 80 per cent of houses and many hotels were damaged. Emergency flights only are landing. Kuoni is offering alternatives at least until 31 October, Virgin until 11 December. Most damage in Jamaica was cosmetic, said the tourist board; airports have reopened and BA and Air Jamaica have resumed flights. Hotels remain closed but all are due to reopen in the next couple of weeks. Thomson will wait to send clients until Jamaica's infrastructure is repaired, and Virgin is offering alternatives as only one of its 12 featured hotels is open. On Grand Bahama many hotels are closed due to damage by Hurricane Frances. Anyone due to travel to the Caribbean area should contact the relevant tour operator, hotel or airline. \u00b7 Information is available at: www.caribbean.co.uk www.bahamas.co.uk www.visitjamaica.com www.visitflorida.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
