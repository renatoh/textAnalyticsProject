We are unusual bedfellows, including Alaska Native leaders, the director of Bristol Bay's largest commercial fishing group, royal jewellers, fisheries conservationists and keen anglers. Together we express our support for protecting Bristol Bay, home to the world's largest, sustainable and most valuable wild-salmon fishery. Anglo American has not gained broad community support for the mine. Some 80% of Bristol Bay residents are opposed. The all-party parliamentary group for tribal peoples has tabled an early day motion, expressing concern at the lack of consent of the local population, as required by the UN declaration of the rights of indigenous people. Last week a group of 30 investors, including the UK local authority pension funds, representing over \u00a3106bn, wrote to the US Environmental Protection Agency urging a review process under the Clean Water Act to evaluate the waste impacts of the proposed mine on the Bristol Bay watershed, which produces roughly half the world's commercial supply of wild sockeye salmon. We do not want to see a renewable resource that feeds the local communities, employs 10,000 people and provides a source of healthy seafood to the world put at risk for a non-renewable resource. We are proud to stand together in our opposition to the proposed Pebble Mine.
