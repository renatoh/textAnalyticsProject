Guardiola is ecstatic, especially with his rookies, most of whom performed very well - especially Zinchenko and, because of a very composed penalty in the shootout on his senior debut, Nmecha. Man City were beatable today, yet remain invincible in England this season. Mahrez, with a stuttering run up, sends a weak shot down the middle ... and Bravo saves! Leicester 3-4 Man City Vardy, who scored at the end of normal time, blasts wide! Leicester 3-4 Man City Jesus, who misses against Spurs at the weekend, gets it right here. Leicester 3-4 Man City Nmecha, a 19-year-old on his debut, sends the keeper the wrong and scores masterfully! Leicester 3-3 Man City Iborra nets neatly despite a good attempted save by Bravo. Leicester 3-2 Man City Maguire bangs it low into the corner. Leicester 2-2 Man City Toure makes no mistake! Leicester 1-2 Man City Gundogan dinks one into the bottom corner as Hamer goes the other way. Leicester 1-1 Man City Fuchs fires high into the top corner! 1-0 to Leicester Leicester will go first .... I would be very interested to hear Pep Guardiola\u2019s take on the theory that shootouts are a lottery. I suspect and hope that he finds it offensive. A penalty shootout looms! Will Guardiola ask any of the youngsters to step up? ET 30 min: Man City threaten to snatch qualifiation at the death, but Toure\u2019s curler from 25 yards is easily saved by Hamer. There will be at least one more minute, that\u2019s all. ET 29 min: Maguire strides forward from half-way and then tries to drop a pass on to the boot of Vardy, who had peeled wide to the right. Vardy tries to volley home from nine yards. But he mis-hits his shot. Leicester are well on top now. Can they find a later winner? And how much time will the ref add on this time, bearing in mind he found eight minutes at the end of normal time? ET 26 min: Mahrez threads a nice low pass into the path of Vardy, who goes down in the box under pressure from Danilo. Penalty!? No, the ref waves away the appeals. It seemed to be the correct decision at first look, as Danilo didn\u2019t appear to be make any contact despite an ungainly lunge. ET 25 min: Mahrez wriggles away from Zinchenko down the right and then fizzes in a curling shot from the corner of the box. Bravo bats it away... ET 24 min: Both managers are standing on the sidelines, gesticulating in ways that their players may or may not understand. ET 22: Walker gives the ball away deep in his own half. Gray plays a snappy one-two with Vardy and closes in on a shot ... but Walkers whizzes back and pokes the ball out for a corner! Leicester substitution: Benalouane on, Dragovic off. That is, er, presumably for the penalty shootout. Et 20 min: Nmecha makes a strong run into the Leicester box and then tries to pick out Jesus. But Iborra makes a timely intervention. Man City regain the ball and recycle it to Zinchenko, who tries a shot from 25 yards. It\u2019s a powerful, swirling effort and flies only inches over the bar! ET 18 min: Excellent tackle by Nmecha on Okazaki. ET 17 min: A scrappy, low-fi start to the second period. Leicester were the more dangerous in the first half; but this could be headed for a shootout, just like Man City\u2019s tie against Wolves in the last round. ET 15+1 min: Toure curls the ball over the wall. Its a good effort, but Hamer flies across goal to save quite comfortably. ET 15 min: Maguire booked for clattering into Dele-Bashiru. Freekick to Man City about 25 yards out. A perfect opportunity for Toure to remind everyone that he\u2019s still on the pitch ... ET 13 min: I\u2019ve just remembered Yaya Toure is on the pitch. ET 12 min: Bravo takes a touch to control a pass back right in front of his goal ... and before he knows it, Vardy is on top of him! The ball ricochets off the striker ... and trickles just wide! ET 10 min: Zinchenko, who has taken his opportunity to impress today, wins a freekick down the left, about 18 yards shy of the corner flag. Gundogan floats over a in-swinger. Iborra nods it back out. ET 9 min: Mahrez curls a freekick to the back post. Maguire sends a downward header several yards wide. ET 7 min: Mahrez is having a party. He\u2019s jinking and teasing his way into the box, looking for an opening while also daring Man City players to try tackling him, at the risk of bringing him down. Eventually, and under much duress, Man City players manage to shoo him away. ET 5 min: Walker is shown a yellow card after going down in the box under a tackle by Dragovic. And it was the right decision, even if you can understand Walker trying it on after the penalty that was given against him earlier. Two wrongs just make one wrong bigger. ET 4 min: Walker shows his speed and alertness to reach the ball before Okazaki after a slip by Adarabioyo hinted at an opening for Leicester. Meanwhile, Arsenal are the first team into the semi-final of this season\u2019s League Cup: they\u2019ve beaten West Ham 1-0 today. ET 2 min: Walker flies down the right and chips in a lovely cross to the near post. Jesus, leaning back, gets a nice header on it, but Hamer makes a comfortable save. ET 1: Man City do the honours. Danilo, by the way, was booked for protesting against the award of that late penalty. This is Leicester\u2019s to lose now: they have something close to their first team on the pitch for extra-time, while Guardiola threw on a couple of teenage debutants towards the end, not suspecting that extra-time would be needed. 90+8 min: The more replays I see of that penalty, the less convinced I am that there was a foul or even much contact. I\u2019d like to hear Gray\u2019s explanation for exactly what sent him tumbling. Vardy hammers it hard and low into the corner, beyond the dive of Bravo. Game back on! Gray went down under as Walker chased him into the box. I\u2019m not sure that was a foul but no matter, Vardy is going to have a chance to take this into extra-time ... 90+5 min: Man City are keeping the ball down the Leicester end, much to the irritation of the home fans. Resurrecting the discussion about Pep\u2019s four competitions, Nathan Walsh points out that \u201cIt should also be noted that Copa del Rey is two-legged from when La Liga teams enter in the round of 32 till the final. And the super cup (Supercopa) is also two-legged. So not really a dramatic difference in # of games compared to England.\u201d 90+3 min: Mahrex sweeps a freekick beyond the back post Maguire rises high but can\u2019t direct his header on target. Man City substitution: Dele-Bashiru on, Foden off. And just as that substitution is made, the fourth official announces that there will be at least eight minutes added time. Pep\u2019s expression suggests he hadn\u2019t seen that coming! Which is understandable: I\u2019m not sure where the officials found that time from. I\u2019d like to think they stopped their watches every time the ball went dead, but if that were the case, there\u2019s be about 35 minutes added on. 90 min: Gray slaps a low pass across the face of goal ... Vardy stretches to meet it six yards out .... but misses it by inches! 89 min: Okazaki can\u2019t quite control a pinged low pass by Fuchs. Adorobioyo and Walker combine to snuff out the danger. Man City substitution: Nmecha on, Diaz off. That\u2019a senior team debut for the 19-year-old forward. 85 min: Man City have no intention of simply hanging on. They take the play down the other end, and Maguire has to slide in to divert the ball wide before Foden can get on the end of a low cross from the left. 83 min: Walker is now on for Mangala. 82 min: Brilliant by Mahrez! This time he gave young Zinchenko a lesson, shimmying past him in the box befre flashing in a low shot/cross from the right. Bravo parries ... and then pounces on the rebound before Vardy. 80 min: Man City are reduced to 10 players while Mangala is off the pitch receiving treatment (in fact, it looks like he\u2019ll be replaced by Walker). Toure goes to centreback in the interim. He is immediately caught dawdling on the ball by Vardy. But Leicester fail to do anything with it. 78 min: Mangala jumps bravely to win a header above Vardy before banging his nose into the striker\u2019s bonce. Blood streams down in crimson tribute to his courage; then the medics scamper on to stop all the gushing. 77 min: Maguire does well to beat Jesus to a pinged low cross by Silva. 75 min: Mahrez tries to coax Zinchenko into diving in for the ball so that he can be easily eliminated just to the left of the Man City box. But the youngster is too wily for that and bides his time ... before making a well-timed intervention and nicking the ball off the 2016 Premier League player of the year. 73 min: Gundogan bangs over a freekick from the right, near the corner flag. Jesus flicks it on at the near post in a move inspired by Guardiola\u2019s mentor, George Graham. But no one got on the end of it to complete the hommage. 70 min: Mangala heads Fuchs\u2019 cross out for a corner as the pressure from Leicester increases. 67 min: Chilwell overhits an attempted pass to Vardy. If he\u2019d got the right weight on that, the striker would have been clear on goal! 66 min: Manuel Lagos has sent this wikipedia link to League Cup competitions from around the world, for anyone interested. Feel free to forward it on to Pep Guardiola. 65 min: Gundogan booked for a suspected dive. 64 min: Mahrez rolls a freekick to Maguire, who tries to blem it into the net from 30 yards. It does\u2019t even make it into the box before it\u2019s blocked. 63 min: Play is becoming more open and tempers are rising: League Cup fever has finally taken hold! Mangala cops a telling off for a forceful clash with Okazaki. The home crowd boo because they think the Frenchman should have been booked but, in fact, he did nothing wrong: the collision was robust but fair. 61 min: Silva dashes in behind Fuchs and down the right wing ... and all the way into the box. From near the byline he tries to knock a lateral pass to Jesus, who would just have to tap it into the net from close range .. but Silva pulls the pass behind him! 60 min: Bravo rushes out of his area to smash the ball out of play just before Mahrez could collect the pass over the top. 58 min: Man City play the ball calmly out from the back despite frantic pressing by Leicester. Bravo was particularly cool as Vardy bore down on him. Leicester substitutions: Mahrez and Vardy on, Albrighton and Iheanacho off. Both of the departed duo had decent games but the changes should amount to an upgrade. 55 min: Mahrez is warming up for Leicester. They\u2019re not giving up on this yet ... 53 min: Jesus flips the bal around to Gundgoan and spins and dashes for the return pass. Hamer dashes out to get there first, with Jesus partially impeded by Dragovic. 50 min: Fuchs launches another throw into the box. Zinchenko heads it away again, but only as far as the edge of the box. Chilwell jumps in to send a diving header ... over the bar. 49 min: Fuchs hurls a long throw from the left into Man City\u2019s six-yard box. It causes all manner of bother until Zinchenko nuts it away. 47 min: Jesus gets told off by the ref for clipping Maguire from behind. By the way, have you seen the first batch of entries to the Guardian\u2019s latest list of the world\u2019s top 100 players? It was compiled with input from a dazzling array of experts, including bona fide footballing aristocracy such as Ronaldo, Hernan Crespo and Barney Ronay. Go on, have a gander: 46 min: The second half has started so it must finish. \u201cRegarding the four competitions, surely Pep meant the league, the FA cup, the league cup, and the FA Community Shield (or whatever it\u2019s called these days)?\u201d suggests Justin Kavanagh. \u201cAnd before you say that that last one isn\u2019t really a competition but a one-off match, bear in mind that you have to win the league (or the FA Cup) to qualify for it, which is more than can be said for the so-called Champions League. Si, Pep knows his English football.\u201d Again, nothing unique about that: lots of countries have equivalents of the Community Shield, including Spain. Guardiola\u2019s reserves have the lead thanks to a lovely goal but Leicester have taken a decent fight to them since then so this tie is still alive. A thunderous half-time team-talk from Claude Puel could be all it takes to trigger a turnaround .... 45+1 min: There will be at least one more minute before the break. \u201cDo you want a fight?\u201d blurts Sam Hughes \u00e0 propos of je ne sais quoi. Are you asking whether I hope this match descends into violence? Or are you challenging me to a duel? If it\u2019s the latter, meet me tomorrow at 10am on Winnie the Pooh Street in downtown Warsaw. I\u2019ll be the bloke in the black suit of armour. 43 min: Albrighton bangs another beautiful cross over from the right. No one had anticipated it, bizarrely, so it runs all the way over to Fuchs on the far side. He sends it back into the danger zone, Mangala completely miskicks but Zinchenko manages to whack it away. 42 min: In today\u2019s other game in this competition, Arsenal have taken a 1-0 lead over West Ham thanks to Danny Welbeck. 40 min: Leicester continue their resurgence as Iheanacho collects the ball some 25 yards out and goes for a goal himself, forcing another decent save fro Bravo. \u201cWho else apart from England has a League Cup?\u201d fumes Oleg Giberstein. \u201cEngland is the only one who has four competitions - and it\u2019s a silly thing to do!\u201d And yet here you are, following the coverage of this League Cup tie. Although apparently you don\u2019t follow the equivalent competitions in France, Scotland and Portugal, to name a few others. 36 min: Fuchs drops in a fine corner into the six-yard box. Bravo comes off his line and punches well away. 33 min: Fuchs releases Chilwell down the left and the youngsters plays a low ball over to Iheanacho. The Nigerian swaps clever passes with Okazaki in the Man City box, as the defence scramble to cover. Then Iheanacho gets off a a quick first-time sidefooted shot from 10 yards ...and Bravo plunges low to his right to make a smart one-handed save! That\u2019s much more like it from the hosts! 31 min: This Man City side have really begin the thrum in the last 10 minutes or so. Leicester are looking all out of ideas at this point. \u201cWhen Pep said \u2018here you have four competitions\u201d what did he mean?\u201d asks Raimond Skrupsk. I\u2019m guessing he meant the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Champions League, which is, of course, three domestic competitions and a continental one. Which is certainly not unique to England. 28 min: After cute work by Diaz, Foden curls a delicious cross in from the left. Leicester put it out for a corner with great difficulty. But they clear the corner more easily. Gundogan won the ball in the centre circle and embarked on a long run forward. Jesus dragged a couple of defenders away with a decoy run. Then, as he approached the box, Gundogan poked a ball through to Silva, arriving in support to his left. And the Portuguese poked the ball past the advancing Hamer and into the net. Swift and deadly. 23 min: Danilo leaves a back pass short, obliging Bravo to charge out of his area and try to punt clear. Iheanacho chases after it ... the keeper gets to it first and boots the ball away and then jumps to avoid a hefty collision with Iheanacho, which suggests the ref didn\u2019t see quite what happened: the striker did nothing wrong \u201cThe action photo at the top of your blog suggests that the EFL is still using the ball that Pep Guardiola called \u201chighly unacceptable\u201d after a match in a previous round,\u201d chirps Peter Oh. \u201cPlease keep an eye on Pep for any expressions of contempt, disgust, or nausea when an errant ball goes into the away side\u2019s technical area.\u201d He was actually asked about that before this match and said he is now happy with the ball: he didn\u2019t say why. 20 min: Man City take a corner short and work the ball eventually to Foden, who tries a long-range shot. It takes a nick off Iborra and dribbles out for another corner. Adarabioyo shows strength and determination to get to the out-swinger before Fuchs, but he heads wide from eight yards. 19 min: Gundogan exchanges passes with Silva down the right an then shapes to cross. But instead he goes for a cheeky lob and darn near catches Hamer out from 25 yards! The keeper backpedals quickly and pushes it over the bar for a corner. 17 min: Zinchenko - playing out of position at left-back, much like Fabian Delph - gets caught by a quick ball over the top. Albrighton sprints down the right and delivers a typically fine cross. Okaaki, scampering in at speed, can\u2019t get above the ball to guide his header downwards from nine yards. 14 min: Panic breaks out at the back for Leicester! Hamer came to intercept near the edge of the area but the ball rolled out so he could not pick it up, and Gundogan stole it and got off a quick shot. Maguire - the only defender between Gundogan and the goal - blocked the shot. Hamer got back in time to thwart Silva\u2019s follow-up effort. 12 min: After much drab probing, Man City get in, courtesy of an error by Fuchs. Silva darted in to the left of the box and fired at goal, obliging Hamer to make a decent save. 8 min: Amartey does well to muscle in front of Diaz and regain possession before the tricky winger could cross from the left. 6 min: Top pressing by Leicester, as iheanacho and Albrighton threaten to dispossess Mangala at the edge of his own area. But the defender uses his strength to hold them off and create just enough room to boot the ball out for a throw-in, which is less than Leicester looked like they might get. 4 min: \u201cIf you squint, Man City\u2019s no35 looks a bit like de Bruyne,\u201d notes Michael George, and he\u2019s not wrong The No35 is the 21-year-old Ukrainian left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko. But if you\u2019re looking for someone who could produce deliveries as sumptuous as De Bruyne today, Marc Albrighton could be your man. 2 min: A pattern has formed: can you guess what it is? That\u2019s right, Man City are dominating possession and the home City are coiling deep and looking to counter, presumably. 1 min: Leicester kick off ... and big the ball straight out of play: that\u2019s surely a deliberate ploy to annoy Pep - such waste can only hurt his brain. The teams stride out on to the pitch and strike their photo poses. Leicester are in Tardis blue, while City wear a lighter shade. All is as it should be. Some players are wearing gloves because it\u2019s cold, which seems perfectly sensible. Here\u2019s Guardiola on why he changed his lineup so much: \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to reach the semi-final ... you cannot play four competitions with the same guys. All around the world countries have three competitions, but here you have four.\u201d Asked what particular advice he has given 17-year-old Phil Foden today, he replies: \u201cNothing. Play like he knows how to play. Do what he has to do.\u201d Puel has also spoken. Brace yourselves for fireworks: \u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity for us. We have to put in a good performance of course. Of course it\u2019s difficult.\u201d And there was plenty more where that came from. You\u2019ve had enough, haven\u2019t you? So then, we\u2019ve got two improvised teams and apparently City have decided to not even fill their bench, plumping for just the six substitutes rather than the permitted seven. Guardiola has also gone for an inexperienced defence. I don\u2019t really get why Puel hasn\u2019t gone full gun against them: Leicester aren\u2019t in Europe, nor are they in relegation bother, and if they get through this tie, there\u2019s a fair chance of them going on to win the whole shebang. I know their fixture list is chock-a-block but it\u2019d have been nice to see them give this one their full attention. But hey, maybe their backup players will seize this opportunity to prove their worth. Leicester: Hamer; Amartey, Dragovi\u0107, Maguire, Fuchs; Albrighton, King, Iborra, Chilwell; Okazaki, Iheanacho. Subs: Jakupovi\u0107, Simpson, Benalouane, Gray, Mahrez, Vardy, Ulloa Man City: Bravo, Zinchenko, Adarabioyo, Mangala, Danilo, Tour\u00e9, B. Silva, G\u00fcndogan, Foden, D\u00edaz, Jesus Subs: Ederson, Walker, San\u00e9, Nmecha, Duhaney, Dele-Bashiru. Well lookee here, suddenly it\u2019s up to the League Cup to make English football appear competitive again. With Manchester City drumming out party beats on the bowed heads of everyone in the Premier League - 16 rhythmic thrashing in a row and counting - this is the only domestic competition in which Pep Guardiola\u2019s jolly artistes have been knocked a little out of their groove, Wolves holding them to a frustrating 0-0 in the last round before losing on penalties. What chance Leicester going the whole hog today and knocking them out of the actual tourney? Very little, if we are to judge by Leicester\u2019s most recent performance, which was an outstandingly limp display against Crystal Palace. But perhaps that was but a glitch and they will today return to playing the slick jive that Claude Puel had taught them prior to that? Remember that the Frenchman came within one bad refereeing decision of winning this competition last season, which is a lot closer than Guardiola has got so far to lifting an English trophy, although City are, of course, on schedule to clinch this season\u2019s Premier League by early January or thereabouts. Today\u2019s lineups will probably show this competition isn\u2019t a priority for either City but it\u2019s not one they\u2019ll want to sacrifice cheaply, all the same. In other words, belter ahoy! Maybe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
