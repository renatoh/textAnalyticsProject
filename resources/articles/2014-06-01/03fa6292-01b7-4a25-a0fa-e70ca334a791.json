Less than six days before their team's opening match against Italy, the \"two Dans\" attempted one-handed handstands and kung fu-like kicks during a performance of capoeira Brazilian martial arts outside the Rocinha community, which is close to England's base camp in S\u00e3o Conrado. The favela \u2013 one of the biggest in Latin America \u2013 is supposed to have been \"pacified\" by the authorities, but the community remains deeply troubled with almost nightly gunfights between police and gangsters. The two England strikers \u2013 along with Jack Wilshire, Adam Lallana and Fraser Forster (who declined to join the capoeira) \u2013 visited a sports complex just outside Rocinha in an act of football diplomacy that also included a \"five figure\" cash gift from the Football Association. Following anti-FIFA protests in Brazil last year and accusations that football's elite are becoming too distant from supporters, outreach activities have probably never been as important. The event started with the capoeira display by local youths, whose leaps and somersaults put even the most acrobatic goal celebrations into the shade. This was followed by an autograph session and ball juggling on the rooftop pitch, set against a backdrop of the favelas homes crammed together on nearby hillsides. After first class travel and starred hotels, Lallana said it was great to see another side of Brazil. \"It puts everything into perspective,\" the England midfielder said. \"I didn't really know what to expect. People said there were 100,000 people living in the favelas. That's a lot of people. But looking at this backdrop, you can see exactly why ... They get on with their lives. It's probably normal for them. To be around players like us may be a life-changing experience for them.\" The ragged artificial pitch posed too many injury risks for the players to take part in a five-a-side game with local kids, but participants said they were thrilled. \"This is very special for my son,\" said Eliana Ribero, the mother of one of the young players. \"It is also good for the community. The image of favelas is the opposite of the reality. We have conflicts, like everywhere, but that's normal. We have a great community.\" But serious problems remain. Police who moved in to Rocinha ostensibly to clamp down on crime have been found guilty of torture and murder. Residents said the authorities have also lost control of some areas of the favela. \"There are frequent shootouts. Walking around at night is a big worry. Armed traffickers with combat weapons patrol some of the higher areas,\" said a local man, who asked to remain anonymous because of the risks of being seen as taking sides. \"The visit of the English team is no big deal. The shootings, rapes and robberies will continue. A visit by famous players doesn't change anything in the lives of the residents.\" Excitement about the World Cup is also more muted than in the past as a result of unease about over-spending on stadiums, corruption and police brutality. There are fewer street decorations in Rocinha, though residents hope that the mood will pick up as the kick-off comes closer. \"People are not so excited. In other years you would see Rocinha totally colourful and decorated. But this year it's definitely been slower to start,\" said Leandro Lereu Paim, a sound engineer. \"But we love football, and we love the team so for sure during the World Cup everyone will start to be involved and there'll be more of a buzz. People are discontent with politics and the management of this country, but not with the team.\" The visit by the England players was appreciated but none of the participants in Monday's event felt they were in the presence of the likely winners of the tournament. \"England is cool,\" said capoeira teacher Cabrito. \"But the final will be Brazil versus Spain.\" The FA might dispute that, but for the moment, the mood was more one of relief at having carried out a worthwhile public relations exercise without any negative fallout. At the end of the event, Trevor Brooking, the FA's head of football development, said he had sent a relieved message to manager Roy Hodgson after Welbeck and Sturridge joined in the capoeira. \"Got through warm-ups unscathed. Very enjoyable session.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
