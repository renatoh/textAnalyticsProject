Darkest day: The French again, this time in the group stages of 1999 when referee Paddy O'Brien awarded a controversial penalty try against them. Won't let you forget: How important the man in the sky is. The 1997 World Cup sevens side had 'Philippians 4:13' plastered on their jerseys, a Bible verse that says: 'I can do all things through Him who strengthens me'. Svengali factor: A former New Zealand SAS soldier, Mac McCallion apparently still can't get enough of the military life. This summer he confined his men to barracks for endless drills and training exercises. Has to beat golf at La Manga. How do you beat them? Highly dependent on their running game, opponents will grind their forwards down to deny them good ball. How do they beat you? Strong on the counter-attack with, as ever, no shortage of ball-handlers. Lost without: Unusually for a winger, Marika Vunibaka might also qualify for our 'Avoid in a dark alley' category. Made his name terrorising foe for Fiji on the sevens circuit. These days he does it for the Crusaders in the Super 12. Avoid in a dark alley: Greg Smith. Veteran hooker brings needed aggression to the pack. Words of wisdom: 'Levu sara!' (plenty of things) declares skipper Isaia Rasila of rugby's never-ending attraction . OSM prediction: Won't be overawed by Scotland or France, but a giant kill may be asking too much. The squad Backs: M Rauluni, S Rabaka, N Little, W Serevi, S Rabeni, A Tuilevu, S Rokini, E Ruivadra, F Delasau, R Caucaunibuca, M Vunibaka, N Ligairi, A Uluinayau. Forwards: J Veitayaki, R Nyholt, I Rasila, N Seru, G Smith, B Gadolo, K Leawere, I Rawaqa, A Naevo, E Katalau, V Maimuri, K Sewabu, A Mocelutu, K Salawa, S Koyamaibole, S Tawake, R Alivereti Doviverata. Did you know that... Fiji faced the prospect of having to book double seats for their players if they managed to qualify for the finals, after a Fijian Rugby Union report in March 2002 damned them for loving family portions and being, well, too fat. 'This confirms what we can see,' Pio Bosco Tikoisuva, the FRU chief executive, said. 'Unfortunately, this is the complete opposite of the world trend.' The guilty Billy Bunters were ordered off the puddings and on to the Ryvitas. The result? An automatic qualifying berth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
