Unless, that is, you head to a spot like Glentress Forest in the Borders, where the Forestry Commission has constructed some superb trails that allow for year-round riding. The freely drained tracks remain rideable in the worst rain, snow and sleet that Scotland can throw at you. Indeed, the fact that they snake beneath thick forest canopies for the most part also means that there's some shelter from the elements, particularly the biker's worst enemy - the wind. Situated two miles east of Peebles, Glentress is now the number-one outdoor attraction in the Borders region, with more than 130,000 visitors last year who came here to hike, bike, ride a horse (there are trails for all three) or just to enjoy a picnic at one of the forest's fine viewpoints. And five miles east at Innerleithen, Red Bull has recently completed a new downhill course for mountain bikers who require such things as 14ft drop-offs to have a good day in the country. To date more than \u00a3100,000 has been spent on the mountain bike trails at Glentress, most of it from Lottery funding, and trail designer Pete Laing, from nearby Selkirk, travelled to France and Switzerland and worked with American experts for inspiration before putting the routes together. The Forestry Commission's regional recreation manager Jeremy Thompson says that more money is being sought from the Lottery to develop further trails, including a race-standard cross-country course that will link in with the Red Bull Trail. The decision to focus on mountain biking at Glentress came about, Thompson says, after the marked increase in bikers using the forest over the past 10 years. \"A lot of them were getting bored with the forest roads and were heading off on to forest walks, where there was a danger of collisions with walkers - so we decided to put in some purpose-built trails.\" So what are the new trails like? Well, because Glentress Forest is the oldest Forestry Commission woodland in southern Scotland, with planting stretching back as far back as 1920, there's a reasonable amount of trees for a start. That said, there are still a few ruler-edge boundaries - in fact the superb Black Trail follows one of these as you start your descent after the long climb to Dunslair Heights at 600m, but that's easily forgotten when you take in the sweeping views across the wild, open moorland above the Tweed Valley. The routes are graded in the increasingly familiar ski resort style with a blue, red and black. Blue is the easiest, consisting of around 7.5km of relatively gentle riding and only 200m of climbing, although it still reaches a good viewpoint on 550m Caresman Hill. Red consists of 15km of mixed forest road and exciting single track, climbing a total of 460m. And Black is 30km long with an unspecified amount of uphill - suffice to say there's a lot. In return, you get some of the finest and most challenging single-track descents you could want. All the routes are built so that, whatever your ability, the ascents are rarely too steep or technical to ride. But it's the descents that you really go for, and these are a fine commendation to the trailbuilders' skills, taking in everything from twisty, cambered single-track to tricky stream crossings on wobbly planks, intimidatingly steep descents, sections over rocks and tree roots, and a nice blast down wide-open fire roads to finish at the car park (where there's a hose to clean your bike and maybe yourself). Interestingly, the routes are also designed with conservation in mind - one of the requirements of the Forestry Commission was that not only should they be rideable in all weather, they should also have a working life of 20-25 years. The whole lot is charted on trail maps available at the car park, although you scarcely need these as the markings on the ground are so good. When I visited Glentress on a bright afternoon, the car park was full - there must have been more than 100 people riding in the forest that day, yet once out on the Black Trail, I saw only six riders other than the three I was with. The ability of the forest to disperse people is another great attraction. Having ridden all over Europe and North America, I have to say that if Glentress and other Forestry Commission sites, such as Afon Argoed and Coed-y-Brenin in Wales, are the way mountain biking is set to go in Britain, there won't be any reason to travel abroad soon, because we really do have some world-class trails in these centres - and the views aren't bad either. But how about a ski lift to the top?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
