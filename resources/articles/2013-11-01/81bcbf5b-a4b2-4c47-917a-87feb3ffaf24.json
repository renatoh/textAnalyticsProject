Sudan's most-watched television network \u2013 Blue Nile \u2013 will shortly broadcast the country's first Apprentice-style reality show, a format that programmers hope will shake up Sudanese television and indirectly boost Sudan's tanking economy. And Mahdi, a former finance minister, is being courted as one of the show's judges. Mashrouy \u2013 Arabic for \"my project\" \u2013 will present 12 young Sudanese entrepreneurs pitching and developing their ideas for a creative start-up firm over the course of several episodes. The dozen hopefuls will be mentored \u2013 and ultimately eliminated \u2013 by four leading Sudanese businesspeople and economists \u2013 before viewers vote on the winner from a shortlist. The Sudanese are no strangers to reality television, but locals say the premise of such a business-oriented show \u2013 which has drawn comparisons with Dragon's Den and the Apprentice \u2013 is unprecedented. \"Even the term 'creative entrepreneurship' is new in Sudan,\" said Mahir Elfiel, one of the show's co-ordinators. \"There was no specific word for it before. And that's the idea behind the whole project \u2013 to introduce the concept here.\" Sudan has a youth unemployment rate of 34% \u2013 one of several contributing factors to recent anti-regime demonstrations in which more than 200 protesters were killed by state officials. The cash-strapped government was once able to keep unemployment under control by employing many young jobseekers within the bowels of its ministries, but its empty coffers \u2013 reduced by state mismanagement and international sanctions \u2013 no longer allow for this. \"There is a limit to how many they can employ,\" said Mahdi. \"The vacancies are in the hundreds, but the unemployed are in the thousands.\" As a result, there is an increasing desire, inside and outside government, to encourage more investment in private enterprise \u2013 and Mashrouy, allocated a primetime slot on Sudan's most popular channel, is one attempt to inspire this change. \"If we can duplicate this kind of programme, I hope it will make a difference,\" said Mahdi. \"It will help people get beyond the traditional thinking of getting employment in the government sector.\" Most private enterprise in Sudan currently involves small, low-budget projects funded by micro-finance. Mashrouy aims to encourage graduates to create larger and more ambitious entrepreneurial projects \u2013 and to encourage banks to invest in them more readily. Contestants include Mustafa Shaib, the hacker behind what he says will be Sudan's first tech company to focus exclusively on internet security, and English teacher Yassim Gasim, who wants to export spicy peanut butter \u2013 a popular Sudanese delicacy that is little known outside the country. Gasim's previous experiences highlight why Sudan's business community is so excited about Mashrouy. Gasim first had the idea for his business five years ago \u2013 but couldn't find anyone willing to finance him, such are the restrictions on \u2013 and lethargy towards \u2013 investment in Sudan. As a result, he imagined that his horizons were limited to small low-tech micro-finance projects such as chicken-breeding. But more ambitious entrepreneurial projects seemed out of Gasim's reach \u2013 and even his vocabulary. \"The first time I read the word riyada,\" said 38-year-old Gasim, referring to the word for entrepreneurship, \"was when I saw the billboard for this show four months ago.\" Sudan has no shortage of entrepreneurial small traders or self-employed day labourers. But with credit only available to those from rich families, the concept of a western-style entrepreneur \u2013 armed with a long term business plan, and backed by investors \u2013 is less well established. So too is a business-based television show. \"It's been challenging,\" said Elfiel, whose colleagues were forced to postpone filming because of the unrest in September. \"We have stuff like American Idol, but nothing business-oriented like Apprentice or Dragons Den. No TV station has done this before.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
