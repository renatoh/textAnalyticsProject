Ages: Bruce is 65, Demi 57. Appearance: A symbol of togetherness, in matching green-striped pyjamas. But I thought they were divorced. This is Hollywood. Divorce is a relative term. Yes, it means they are no longer relatives. Don\u2019t be silly: in Los Angeles, divorce is just the start of a beautiful relationship. I have no idea what you\u2019re on about. That\u2019s because you have your head stuck in a book and have not been studying Bruce and Demi\u2019s grown-up daughter Tallulah\u2019s Instagram account. You\u2019re so right. I\u2019m finding Tolstoy a great comfort during the lockdown. Well, that\u2019s why you\u2019ve missed a fantastic picture posted by Tallulah showing her mum and dad embracing while giving a thumbs-up as they quarantine together. Isn\u2019t that a bit weird? Look, it may seem weird to you, sitting at home eating beans on toast and reading Tolstoy in your flat in Cheam, but Hollywood A-listers do things differently. Why shouldn\u2019t Bruce, Demi, their three daughters, two of the daughters\u2019 boyfriends, some unidentified bloke and lots of Demi\u2019s small dogs isolate en masse and post pictures on social media of them all wearing fetching pyjamas? Even the dogs! No reason. It\u2019s just I thought they had been divorced for years. They divorced in 2000; Willis married the model Emma Heming in 2009. Willis and Heming have two daughters together. Is Heming also seen in her pyjamas? Strangely enough, no, but she is unconcerned about her husband quarantining with his ex-wife, responding to the picture with the comment: \u201cNot many can pull that color off! Lookin good squad.\u201d Do Moore and Heming get on well? Like sisters, apparently. Moore attended Willis and Heming\u2019s wedding, and was there again when they renewed their vows in 2019. She\u2019s clearly good at not harbouring a grudge. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing to say, but I\u2019m very proud of our divorce,\u201d Moore wrote last year in her bestselling memoir, Inside Out. What are they doing in their mass isolation? Moore has had a few issues in the past with substance abuse, and that put a strain on her relationship with her daughters. That\u2019s over now and this is a great opportunity to continue their renewed relationship. Moore once revealed to the New York Times that she and her daughters are very into \u201cspiritual psychology\u201d and \u201csoul-centred living\u201d. Beats Scrabble, I suppose. What a very Cheam remark. Do say: \u201cWhat a wonderfully heartwarming story in these dark times.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cYou don\u2019t think they did it just to sell the fancy pyjamas, do you?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
