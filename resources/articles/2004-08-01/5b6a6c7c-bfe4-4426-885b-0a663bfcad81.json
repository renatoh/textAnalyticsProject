Ask Jeeves, but probably for sentimental reasons. It was one of the first companies I did business with on the internet, six years ago. They gave me a promotional T-shirt which I'm still quite fond of. I do believe they have the best national language search that's out there. Ever begun a relationship online? My husband is a complete technophobe, so I guess the answer is no. To his horror I was tempted to buy my wedding ring online - he protested and we went to buy it at a normal jewellers. Last technological faux pas? I was recently pulled up by my colleagues for using the Yahoo messenger buzzer. I was told it was extremely annoying and I should stop. It is a way of getting someone's attention but I guess it was too \"in your screen\", as it were. It's the instant-messenger equivalent of using capitals on email, which everyone used to do, the way people shouted into the telephone when it was first invented. Main source of news online? I'm addicted to the internet's ability to deliver news as and when I want it as opposed to it being broadcast at me, like in other media. I set loads of Yahoo! news alerts on what I'm interested in. Most useful website? The one that I have been most loyal to would be Hotmail. I don't know which company came up with the slogan \"email is for life\", but for me it has been the only constant in the past five years. I have moved jobs and house but not email. It's supposed to be one of the products that customers are most loyal to. Do you use a screen saver? I have a 17th-century quote: \"Go placidly amid the noise and haste.\" Most surprising new use of the internet that you have seen? Hitwise.com. It says to a retailer: we can tell you every day where a customer goes before you or where he goes after, or what his favourite shops are. If you think about it that's pretty amazing. Do you still bother with old media? Not so much for information but definitely for entertainment. I am an avid Hello! reader. I love the cinema: the last thing I saw was an obscure Russian art-house movie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
