It very much depends on who is taking the risks. In the opening match on Centre Court Nadal, the defending champion and world No1, beat Michael Russell, a 33-year-old American hard-court specialist of worthy but modest achievement, ranked 90th in the world and who, briefly, sent a frisson around Wimbledon playing just the sort of tennis that Nadal was advocating. He drew ripples of admiration from a crowd who barely knew who he was for attacking the net and trading forehands with one of the cleanest hitters in the history of the sport. Russell bashed, lobbed, chipped and scrapped. Nadal was shaken. The Spaniard had to save a break point in his first service game. Russell had another break point in the sixth game and this time Nadal double-faulted to go 4-2 down. What if the 5ft 8in Texan pulled off a miracle, we asked the venerable Bud Collins, sitting nearby? Where would it rank among first-round shocks at Wimbledon? Up there with Charlie Pasarell putting out the defending champion Manuel Santana in 1967, he said. We scribbled down our stats. We recalled how John Isner had similarly pushed Nadal to the limit over five sets in the first round at Roland Garros last month. Others spoke of Roger Federer's first-round nightmare here last year against the Colombian Alejandro Falla. But Russell faded, as we suspected he would. He double-faulted twice and then hit a forehand long to drop serve and Nadal took the first set. Russell won just four games in the remaining two sets and his grand fight was over. For mortals, going for broke against the elite is suicidal. Only Nadal's peers dare take him on at his own game \u2014 and even they struggle for parity. CHAIR BOXING It is the 30th anniversary of the War Of Independence II in the Wimbers press room. There wasn't really a winner when the Brits and the Yanks scrapped over a tough question for John McEnroe about his then on/off girlfriend Stacey Margolin, but Nigel Clarke, then with the Mirror, now with the Express, decked Charlie Steiner, who was working for an American radio station then and is now a big shot on ESPN. Nigel, like Andy Murray, loves boxing. But he is not too proud to admit he cheated in that quick bout. He threw his kayo blow while standing on a chair. It is unlikely there will be any trouble this year. For a start, the chairs are fixed to the floor. Also, our trans-Atlantic friends are now rubbish at tennis and start to lose interest about day three. KEEP YOUR HAT ON It took Wimbledon quite a while to get a roof, but they're not going to wear it out. There was no chance of pulling on the hood early on the first day, or adding a fourth match in the evening, to ease the fixture list \u2014 but they might have a rethink on Wednesday, when the weather is expected to turn seriously foul. On day one, meanwhile, it did its job, allowing fans to see three completed matches. TV was satisfied again, screening Andy Murray's opening match in peak viewing time, just as they did the first time the roof was used, for Murray's match against Stanislas Wawrinka two years ago. The roof has been a canny investment, all round. GETTING THERE This blog starts its journey in Muswell Hill in north London and, thanks to Crouch End neighbour and snapper colleague Tom Jenkins, who drives, we did the journey on day one in one hour and 27 minutes. Tomorrow, post-strike, it's back on the bus (102 or 234), tube (Northern Line to Euston, Victoria to Victoria, District to Southfields) and a 15-minute stroll to the ground. Will be surprised if it takes as long as Tom - although thanks for the lift, mate. Alternatively, you can tube it to South Wimbledon on the Northern Line and mini-cab it in for \u00a37, plus tip. THEY SAID WHAT? It is the fate of beaten players to come to the press room afterwards and answer only questions about the better-known opponent who has just humiliated them in public. And so it was that the 34-year-old very late substitute Marc Gicquel, ranked 119 in the world, stepped up to tell us how good was the latest wunderkind, Milos Raonic. The 20-year-old Canadian had just carted him off Court 14 in straight sets, sticking 25 aces past him, in a bit over an hour and a half. \"It's tough, because I couldn't see where was the serve of Raonic is going,\" the amiable Frenchman struggled to tell us in faltering English. \"He can serve every side. I cannot read his serve.\" Gicquel says he only found out half an hour beforehand that he was going in against Superboy in place of the injured Italian, Fabio Fognini. Raonic says he was told 45 minutes before he went on court. Did Gicquel know how good Raonic was? \"Yeah, I saw him on TV.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
