Directed by Gareth Nicholls, who enjoyed such success with David Ireland\u2019s Ulster American last year. If You\u2019re Feeling Sinister: A Play With Songs Gilded Balloon Patter Hoose For all of the sensitive boys and girls who have swooned at the Belle and Sebastian album of the same name, Eve Nicol\u2019s play should be an indulgent treat. The Glasgow theatremaker has used Stuart Murdoch\u2019s lyrics to tell the story of an artist and an academic who fall dangerously in love. Moot Moot Summerhall Rosana Cade and Ivor MacAskill are Barry and Barry, lookalike radio hosts with grey suits, grey hair and moustaches, hosting a surreal radio phone-in. Complete with office-chair choreography and a live soundscape by Yas Clarke, it is a satire of the cliches and catchphrases of modern communication. Hair of the Wild C at SESH Hairdressing Spanish artist Concha Vidal believes you can learn a lot about someone from their hair. What we have (or do not have) on our heads tells the world about our gender, class and even our mental health. Performing in a real salon, Vidal digs out some wigs and speculates about their owners. La Reprise. Histoire(s) du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre (I) Royal Lyceum Milo Rau is one of the hottest directors on the European theatre scene, although his work has been relatively little seen in the UK. A chance to catch up now with his meditation on violence, both real and theatrical, and an evocation of the homophobic murder of Ihsane Jarfi, a 32-year-old Belgian man, in 2012. All of Me Summerhall A few years ago, performer Caroline Horton stirred some debate about the appropriateness of using a jokey format to discuss anorexia. She was speaking from experience, however, and behind the send up of a micromanaging persona, Mess was a touching insight into an eating disorder. In All of Me, she is on similarly fraught ground as she uses a backstage metaphor to consider the urge to live and to die. Cardboard Citizens: Bystanders Summerhall As homelessness grows more visible on our streets, the humanising message of Cardboard Citizens is all the more urgent. After winning acclaim for its adaptation of Cathy Come Home a couple of years ago, the company returns with a compendium of true-life stories from homeless people, ranging from a Polish migrant to a Windrush-generation boxer. Arthur Your home Quite a few family units are doing shows on the fringe, including this by Daniel Bye, who is joined by his infant son, Arthur, under the direction of his wife, Sarah Punshon. To see the show, which picks apart the nature-nurture debate, you have to book it for your own living room. How Not to Drown Traverse Playwright Nicola McCartney joins forces with Dritan Kastrati to dramatise his experience firstly as a refugee from Kosovo and secondly as a child in the UK care system. The ThickSkin co-production, directed by Neil Bettles, is about the trauma of never being welcome in the world. House of Hundred C Aquila An intriguing-sounding installation that combines video, live looping, traditional Turkish music and sound effects to evoke the transition of an Istanbul mansion from the Ottoman era to the present day. Based on the family history of creator Yesim Ozsoy, it is staged by Istanbul theatre company Galata Perform. Oedipus King\u2019s theatre Celebrated director Robert Icke collaborates with the formidable ensemble of Internationaal Theater Amsterdam in his own update of the Sophocles tragedy. We\u2019re now in the age of a media-savvy politician \u2013 somewhere between Obama and Macron \u2013 on the night of a presidential election that\u2019s going swimmingly until awkward secrets return from the past. Lucy McCormick: Post Popular Pleasance Courtyard With her last show, Triple Threat, McCormick re-enacted the birth of Christ from the point of view of both Mary and the baby. It was not for the fainthearted. Expect more filth and iconoclasm as she turns her attention to the use and abuse of power in the company of Samir Kennedy and Ted Rodgers. Musik Assembly Rooms Pet Shop Boys fans on standby as the team behind Closer to Heaven reunite for a one-woman show. The story of fictional rock icon Billie Trix is written by Jonathan Harvey, performed by Frances Barber and includes six new songs by the electropop legends. Islander: A New Musical Roundabout @ Summerhall Part of the Made in Scotland programme, this small-scale musical has been praised for its haunting soundtrack of layered voices created by live looping. Suitable for children and adults, it\u2019s inspired by Scottish folk music and tells the tale of a lonely island where a mysterious stranger is washed up. Narcolepsy Summerhall Theatremaker Chris Goode has a 25-year record on the fringe, so it\u2019s an appropriate time for him to look back to his formative days. Reflecting on gay life in the 1990s, he focuses on the late River Phoenix, in a show that is one part documentary, one part \u201cfractured autobiography\u201d. Purposeless Movements The Studio Robert Softley Gale\u2019s stock is high after the runaway success of the subversive My Left/Right Foot \u2013 The Musical, which he wrote and directed. Here, working with his Birds of Paradise company, he creates a dance-theatre piece focusing on the \u201cpurposeless movements\u201d of four men, like him, with cerebral palsy. The Last of the Pelican Daughters Pleasance Courtyard Developed by Complicite, this show by the Wardrobe Ensemble is about four sisters coming to terms with the loss of their mother. A comedy about inheritance, loss and justice, it looks at the way people can exert a hold on us even after they\u2019re gone. From the creators of Education, Education, Education. Pathetic Fallacy CanadaHub @ King\u2019s Hall It\u2019s all very well talking the environmental talk, but if you\u2019re burning up the planet in the process, you could be part of the problem. Step forward Anita Rochon, who appears in her own green-themed show only by remote video while a local stand-in takes her place in the lead role. Rich Kids: A History of Shopping Malls in Tehran Traverse Javaad Alipoor scored a fringe hit with The Believers Are But Brothers, an interactive play about radicalisation and misinformation, which is returning for a lap of honour at Assembly George Square Studios. Meanwhile, the writer and director looks at the growing disparity in wealth between the rich and poor in Rich Kids, a play about entitlement, consumption and digital technology. Total Immediate Collective Imminent Terrestrial Salvation The Studio Actor and playwright Tim Crouch joins forces with the National Theatre of Scotland for a piece of apocalyptic meta-theatre. Contemplating our need to come together in a theatre to see a fictional tale played out, he asks the audience to join with him to do exactly that \u2013 and maybe change the world. Dance and circus Hard to Be Soft \u2013 A Belfast Prayer Royal Lyceum London-born Oona Doherty arrived in Belfast aged 10. Hard to be Soft recreates her observations of the alien culture she landed in, from the twitchy energy and pent-up aggression to the \u201charsh strong girls\u201d practising for disco-dancing competitions. David Holmes provides the soundtrack. The Crucible Edinburgh Playhouse A world premiere from Scottish Ballet, celebrating its 50th anniversary year. American choreographer Helen Pickett digs into the drama, claustrophobia and fear of Arthur Miller\u2019s 1953 play The Crucible. Danced to a new, live score by the appropriately monikered Peter Salem. Trisha Brown: In Plain Site Jupiter Artland Postmodern dance icon Brown died in 2017 but her company lives on. In tune with the choreographer\u2019s interest in bodies interacting with the structures around them, the dancers perform some of Brown\u2019s short pieces amid the sculptures at the wonderful Jupiter Artland. Looping: Scotland Overdub Zoo Southside An Afropunk ceilidh club night with a political edge, led by Scottish Dance Theatre and Optimo records. SDT\u2019s dozen dancers let loose in moves by Felipe de Assis and Rita Aquino, who created the original Brazilian show that inspired this Scottish spin-off. Ockham\u2019s Razor: This Time Saint Stephens theatre British aerialists Ockham\u2019s Razor make work that is full of charm, warmth and humanity. At 2016\u2019s festival they won a Total Theatre award for Tipping Point and now they\u2019re back with a meditation on time, performed by a cast aged 13-60. The Hospital Dance Base Twisted dance theatre from Norway\u2019s Jo Str\u00f8mgren Kompani, The Hospital was first seen at the Edinburgh fringe back in 2005. Its original cast returns, 14 years on, as three sadistic nurses in an empty hospital playing out a gory comic horror. Body Language Dance Base Inspired by the idea that 65% of our communication is non-verbal, this UK premiere from the excellent Dublin company CoisC\u00e9im Dance Theatre promises a spontaneous performance each day, created in real time from live interviews, photography, video, music and dance. Rachael Young: Nightclubbing &amp; Out Summerhall A theatre performer and live artist increasingly using movement to make her point, Young has been garnering praise for two defiant shows looking at black and queer bodies and their space in the world, via dancehall, Afrofuturism and the goddess Grace Jones. Super Sunday Circus Hub Think Jackass doing circus. This grungy, freewheeling show from Finland\u2019s Race Horse Company makes its Edinburgh debut, packed with japes and genuine peril, from the Wheel of Death to the human-sized catapult, plus some of the most joyfully transcendent trampolining you\u2019ll see. Raven Assembly Roxy The brilliant Bryony Kimmings worked with Berlin circus trio Still Hungry to bring some of her straight-talking style to this piece exploring the realities of motherhood. NB. For more a more millennial take on feminist circus, check out mouthy Australians Yuck Circus. Comedy John Kearns Monkey Barrel Still the only comic ever to win Best Newcomer and Best Show at consecutive festivals, the buck-teeth-and-tonsure-wig funnyman \u2013 a comic laureate of suburban bathos \u2013 returns with Double Take and Fade Away, his first show to premiere at Edinburgh since his 2014 Comedy award win. Stephen Fry Festival theatre There aren\u2019t many acts of whom you can say, \u201cembarking on his first tour in 40 years\u201d. Step forward Stephen Fry, bringing the stage version of his Greek legends book Mythos to the EIF as the opening dates of a UK tour \u2013 his first since hitting the road with Hugh Laurie four decades ago. Sophie Duker Pleasance Courtyard Full fringe debut for the much-touted \u201csexy-cerebral comedy underdog\u201d Duker, of C4\u2019s Riot Girls and club night Wacky Racists. Her show Venus is described as \u201can unconventional journey of woke self-discovery\u201d, addressing her daddy issues, hatred of Yorkshire puddings and penchant for sexy racists. Nick Helm Pleasance Dome The last time he brought a new show to the fringe, Nick Helm\u2019s One-Man Mega Myth was nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy award in 2013. Six years on, the star of Uncle returns with another fragile/aggressive nugget of hoarse, heavy-metal comedy. Catherine Cohen Pleasance Courtyard Known for her weekly cabaret at Alan Cumming\u2019s Manhattan club, the 27-year-old alt-comedy darling specialises in self-mocking jokes and songs about dating in NYC. This is her Edinburgh debut. Kieran Hodgson Pleasance Courtyard A treat for completist comedy fans, as multiple Edinburgh Comedy award nominee Hodgson revives his four hit solo shows \u2013 from the cute French Exchange to last year\u2019s big-hitting Brexit pre-history \u201975 \u2013 in rep throughout the second half of the festival. If you only see one: 2015\u2019s Lance is a cracker. Desiree Burch Heroes @ The Hive Desiree\u2019s Coming Early! runs the title of her new show \u2013 ironically, given she\u2019s a year late for this engagement with fringe audiences, having had to cancel her 2018 run. The wait is likely to have been worth it for fans of the New Yorker\u2019s unflinching and energetic comedy \u2013 as seen on Frankie Boyle\u2019s New World Order and beyond. Simon Munnery The Stand A little slice of comedy history here, as perennial fringe maverick Simon Munnery does a very un-Munnery thing, and revives his hit character from yesteryear Alan Parker: Urban Warrior. However will this \u201cWolfie Smith of the 90s\u201d cope with the blasted political landscape of 2019? We\u2019ll soon find out. John Robins Pleasance Courtyard You\u2019d forgive John Robins for feeling overlooked. Coverage of his break-out 2017 breakup show focused as much on his ex, Sara Pascoe, as himself. Then the show with which it shared the Edinburgh Comedy award \u2013 Hannah Gadsby\u2019s Nanette \u2013 became a global phenomenon. Happily, no one is better than Robins at turning mortification and inadequacy into blistering comedy \u2013 as Hot Shame may demonstrate. Jonny and the Baptists Assembly Roxy What do you do when you\u2019ve been making \u201cmusical-activist\u201d lefty comedy for a decade, and the country\u2019s come to this? Pretend everything is just fine, according to Jonny Donahoe and Paddy Gervers, whose new show aims (it claims) to heal a divided world. Elsewhere in Edinburgh, Donahoe premieres his first solo theatre show since the global hit Every Brilliant Thing. Phil Wang Pleasance Courtyard The title of Phil Wang\u2019s new one, Philly Philly Wang Wang \u2013 hot on the heels of recent Radio 4 vehicle Wangsplaining \u2013 may not suggest sophistication. But judging by its rave reviews in Melbourne this spring, and the high quality of 2017 predecessor Kinabalu, a clever, contemplative and very funny show seems a certainty. Eddie Izzard Assembly George Square Who knows what to expect from the standup turned actor turned activist, pitching up in Edinburgh \u2013 where he was nominated for the Perrier award 28 years ago \u2013 with a work-in-progress reading, of all things, of Dickens\u2019 Great Expectations. It sounds like the quintessential fringe ticket. Phoebe Robinson Assembly George Square NYC comic and actor Robinson, best known for her hit 2 Dope Queens and Sooo Many White Guys podcasts, makes her UK standup debut. As per the title of her bestseller Everything\u2019s Trash, But It\u2019s OK, the show \u2013 called Sorry, Harriet Tubman \u2013 celebrates pop culture and analyses her failure to live up the black female icons of yesteryear. Josie Long The Stand There are Edinburgh mainstays and then there\u2019s Josie Long, indie comedy goddess, activist, film-maker \u2013 and now a mum, which is the subject of her new show. Like much of Long\u2019s work, Tender will thrum with the tension between Long\u2019s sunny disposition and the despair of being a progressive in grimly regressive times. Zo\u00eb Coombs Marr Monkey Barrel A Barry award-winner (and Edinburgh nominee) as her sexist standup alter ego, Dave, then talk of the fringe in critique-the-critics theatre event Wild Bore, Coombs Marr steps out from behind the gimmicks (she claims) in this UK debut of 2018 show Bossy Bottom. Rave-reviewed in Melbourne, it takes aim again at the tired conventions of trad standup. Rose McGowan Assembly Hall Where better than the fringe for big names to try something new? \u201cIt\u2019ll be my first time performing a song live!,\u201d says movie star Rose McGowan \u2013 now better known, of course, as a #MeToo campaigner. Her four-performances-only Edinburgh debut, mixing spoken word, visuals and music, promises to teach us \u201chow to create a liberated, fairer society for ourselves\u201d. Ciar\u00e1n Dowd Pleasance Courtyard The returning crop of 2018 Comedy award contenders is strong this summer, with Ahir Shah, Glenn Moore, Sarah Keyworth and more back for another pop at the prizes. None whet the appetite more than Ciar\u00e1n Dowd\u2019s ridiculous Zorro pastiche Don Rodolfo, who swashbuckled his way to last year\u2019s best newcomer gong and now returns, improbably enough, as a priest. Lou Sanders Monkey Barrel Her 2018 show Shame Pig discussed her recovery from alcoholism, and \u2013 perhaps not coincidentally \u2013 was her biggest hit, winning the Comedians\u2019 Choice award for best show at the fringe. Expect the outr\u00e9 but companionable Sanders to capitalise with follow-up Say Hello to Your New Step-Mummy. Anna Drezen Pleasance Courtyard Some of America\u2019s finest female comics announced themselves to the UK recently via eye-catching fringe runs \u2013 Michelle Wolf in 2016; Kate Berlant last year. Might 2019 be the turn of Anna Drezen \u2013 writer for SNL, editor of satirical woman\u2019s mag Reductress, writer of How to Win at Feminism? Ahir Shah Monkey Barrel Mr Dependable Ahir Shah has delivered consistently strong comedy sets in recent years \u2013 usually political, although 2018\u2019s Duffer swerved towards intimacy with the tale of a trip to India to visit his sick gran. After two successive Comedy award nods, Shah\u2019s new show, Dots, is worth a flutter for this year\u2019s big prize. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 June 2019 to correct the title of the Pet Shop Boys musical Closer to Heaven."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
