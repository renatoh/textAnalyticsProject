Dominic Rabb is expected to signal this morning that lockdown measures will remain in place beyond next week, in the first key decision to be taken with Boris Johnson in intensive care, where he has spent a third night. There is heightened concern that any suggestion of loosening restrictions could have an immediate impact on the Easter holidays, with concerns a growing minority will flout the law during the break. At least five police chief constables want tougher measures brought in. A new study on China\u2019s experience of the virus warns that restrictions can\u2019t end until a vaccine is found. \u201cWithout herd immunity against Covid-19, cases could easily resurge as businesses, factory operations, and schools gradually resume,\u201d said Prof Joseph T Wu from the University of Hong Kong, who co-led the study. Our Science Weekly podcast explores how it is possible to lift a lockdown, and you can read the measures in place to enforce restrictions around the world over Easter. At home, Britons are being urged to help raise \u00a35m for NHS staff with One Million Claps appeal, as part of the third \u201cclap for carers\u201d tonight. Meanwhile domestic abuse helplines are reporting a 25% surge in calls. The US has again recorded its highest one-day death toll, with 1,858 fatalities. New York retains its grim position as the worst-hit city, with more than 4,000 deaths in total. But the White House\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, said there was cautious optimism that mitigation efforts were working, raising hopes the US could defy the projected death toll of 100,000-240,000. African Americans are being hit hardest, with data showing they are dying in disproportionate numbers. As global cases approached 1.5 million, the World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told world leaders not to politicise the coronavirus, in an apparent rebuff to Donald Trump, who has accused the WHO of being \u201cChina-centric\u201d and failing in its initial response to the pandemic. Tedros said politicising the debate would lead to more deaths: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to have many more body bags then you refrain from doing it.\u201d Here is our latest at-a-glance summary and we will have all the developments throughout the day on our coronavirus live blog. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Sanders pulls out \u2013 Bernie Sanders has withdrawn from the Democratic presidential challenger race, opening the way for Joe Biden to take on Donald Trump. The 78-year-old Vermont senator announced his exit from the campaign in a live-streamed event from his home, capping what has been an extraordinary rise from relative obscurity to standard-bearer of the American left. \u201cI cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour,\u201d Sanders said. He made it clear Biden would be the Democratic nominee and that he would actively throw his support behind the former vice president. Columnist Bhaskar Sunkara says Sanders may be out but his political revolution is not over. * * * Cardinal George Pell \u2013 Victims of child sexual abuse should not be dissuaded from coming forward as a result of Australia\u2019s high court overturning the jury conviction of Cardinal George Pell on historical child sex abuse charges, experts said. \u201cIt would be unfortunate and legally wrong if the message in the community was that the high court\u2019s ruling has weakened the strength of, or point in, bringing such cases to court or making properly founded allegations,\u201d Prof Gideon Boas, from Melbourne\u2019s La Trobe university said. \u201cThe bottom line is that the ruling will have little or no effect on civil cases and limited effect on future criminal cases.\u201d * * * Ostrich eggs mystery \u2013 The British Museum is set to reexamine decorated eggs, including ones that date back to the bronze age, to understand their origins and design. \u201cThousands of years before Easter, people were already decorating eggs. We are now closer than ever to cracking the conundrum of who created the eggs and who coveted them,\u201d said the project leader, Dr Tamar Hodos of Bristol university. Coronavirus extra In our 100 days that changed the world series, the Guardian reports on the cluster effect \u2013 how social gatherings were rocket fuel for Covid-19\u2019s spread, including at Australia\u2019s Bondi Beach.

The Guardian\u2019s Michael Safi and Patrick Wintour recount the first 100 days as coronavirus took hold, upending the lives of billions of citizens Lunchtime read: The sound of Antarctic icebergs melting It was mid-January, the peak of the Antarctic summer, when the Guardian\u2019s global environment editor, Jonathan Watts, joined a pole-to-pole expedition by scientists and campaigners on two Greenpeace ships. The journey to map the frozen continent\u2019s ecosystems also recorded the changing underwater landscape, and the sound of melting icebergs: \u201cWe were so close to the ice that this ancient fizz was surprisingly loud. Though we humans never hear it above the surface, this is the sound the Antarctic makes every summer. And as the planet heats, the sound is getting louder.\u201d Sport The new head of UK Athletics has said any employee who does not share her vision for \u201cethical success\u201d will lose their job, and there are \u201cdefinite plans\u201d to hand over a 2015 internal report into Alberto Salazar\u2019s relationship with Mo Farah.

And a Florida man has filed a lawsuit against Tiger Woods and his caddie, claiming he suffered injuries from the caddie pushing him out of the way during the Valspar Championship that Woods played two years ago. Business Half a billion people could be pushed into poverty as economies around the world shrink because of the coronavirus outbreak, a new study has warned. Research by the United Nations University\u2019s World Institute for Development Economics Research shows developing countries could be set back by up to 30 years. \u201cThe impact will be quite devastating,\u201d said co-author Andy Sumner, international development professor at King\u2019s College London, who warned of a \u201cpoverty tsunami\u201d.
