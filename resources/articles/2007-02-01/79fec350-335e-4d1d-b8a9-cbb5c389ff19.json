So, it is depressing to think that so many of us spend eight hours a day, five days a week exposed to the aromas of the office. And what are we breathing in hour after hour at our desk? Damp, industrial cleaning products and the occasional toasty note. In short, the smell of work. But unless something gets very stinky, we rarely even consider the fragrances in our immediate environment: we don't stop to sniff the roses, let alone wake up and smell the coffee. This lack of awareness is all the more strange considering the riot of fragrances (including whiffy employees and competing perfumes) brewed up behind the sealed windows of the office. \"If you want to know whether the smell of a place is important in changing people's moods, go into a florist's shop and watch as people walk in. Watch their faces as they smell the leaves and the blossoms and you'll see them start to smile and you can watch their moods lift,\" urges smell scientist and perfumer George Dodd from AromaScience. But despite this connection between smell and emotions, for thousands of years how our sense of smell works has remained a mystery. It was only in 2004 that Richard Axel and Linda Buck were awarded the Nobel prize for describing the exact process of how our olfactory system works. Humans have approximately 6 million smell receptors in their noses (by comparison, dogs have more than 200 million), which detect odour molecules; our response to these molecules is processed by the limbic system, the part of the brain that deals with emotions. \"Good\" odours can release dopamine and serotonin - which have an antidepressant action. Unfortunately, finding a consensus on what smells good is almost impossible. \"Smell is intensely personal and one thing that is certain is that you will get a strong emotional response to the issue. In the work I do with companies, I emphasise that they should focus on the personal smell environment rather than trying to get them to push smells into a public environment,\" explains Dodd. As well as the possibility of smells making us happy, however, there is also the possibility that the smell of the office could make employees sick. Although medical opinion is divided on the cause of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, one theory is that the condition is caused by the smell of chemicals we are routinely exposed to at work, from bleach to air fresheners and even perfumes. A straw poll of office workers certainly bears out Dodd's prediction of a strong emotional response to fragrances: a top five hated smells become apparent quite quickly. Top of the list is body odour (it seems that every office has one person who could become better acquainted with soap). Next is the smell of cigarettes filtering in through windows, or the smell of a colleague shortly after their fag break. Interestingly, perfume rates highly among the least favourite smells, shortly followed by pungent foods. But perhaps the most unexpected entry on the list, nominated by both men and women, is wet suits. Charlie from Manchester explains: \"If you get caught in the rain and your suit gets wet it's a nightmare. As you sit in the office and you start to get warmer, there's a weird smell that emanates from the material which smells unappealingly like you have a damp dog under your desk. It's not a good smell.\" But while all but the most pungent of smells in the office might not register on our conscious minds, according to the Smell Report research carried out by Kate Fox, companies are keen to exploit these strong reactions. The next time you're late paying a bill it could be interesting to sniff your final reminder. A UK company called Bodywise found that people who received bills scented with androstenone - a steroid found in sweat - were 17% more likely to settle up. There are also companies who use particular scents at different points in the day to establish different states - a blast of citrus in the morning to wake workers up and woody scents in the afternoon to raise flagging energy levels. \"In a very crude sense you can use different smells to get a different response from people. But it comes back, ultimately, to individual preference. I'm very much in favour of people looking after their own immediate personal space and using smells which will not diffuse very much so that they don't effect the wider environment,\" explains Dodd. Of course, not all smells are bad - and workers looking to fragrance their personal space with smells their fellow employees might like could do worse than finding some chips, which rated highly in the straw poll. Other favourite smells around the office include coffee (but definitely not on someone's breath), toast and mown lawns outside. And Samantha, a secretary from Bristol, suggested one smell that must be universally popular: \"Even though the smells on leaving the office - petrol fumes, damp leaves and cold air on your nose - are no more fragrant than the smells inside the office, they suggest freedom to me and therefore have to be the best of all work smells.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
