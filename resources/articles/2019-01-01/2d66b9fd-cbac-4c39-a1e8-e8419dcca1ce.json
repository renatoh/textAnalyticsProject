Overwhelmed as Arsenal ripped into them through a one-sided first half, Maurizio Sarri\u2019s team had no incision of their own with which to muster anything approaching a riposte. A side lacking a focal point to their front-line limped away in defeat attempting to recall what had constituted their solitary shot on target, and with the gap to fifth and sixth place trimmed to a precarious three points. Their efforts had been feeble. They are a team treading water at present and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, a short-term fix at 31 and a striker with no previous experience of the helter-skelter of this division, cannot arrive on loan from Juventus soon enough. How they could have done with the Argentinian in his pomp here as they attempted to retrieve the deficit shipped in that furious opening period, though that lack of firepower was only one aspect of the problem. Their play was too stodgy, their threat only ever sporadic, but it was Sarri\u2019s attack on their character which will have stung most of all. His post-match laceration questioned his players\u2019 motivation, determination and, as a result, their basic commitment. A club which only recently was built around John Terry and Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba and Petr Cech, has suddenly been rendered mentally frail. Prone to implosion. A side who roll over who are \u201cnever going to be a team well known for its battling and fighting qualities\u201d. That was utterly damning, the kind of public criticism that, when key players had the owner\u2019s ear, might actually have left the head coach\u2019s position under serious scrutiny. Sarri\u2019s predecessor, Antonio Conte, was once rendered equally livid by a thrashing in this arena, but duly ripped up his blueprint and started again with a completely different approach. Chelsea went on to win the title that season. Sarri, however, does not work that way. He was brought to this club to play a certain way, with a style that established his reputation at Napoli, and he will not change. Yet, if this group really cannot adapt, that inflexibility could end up costing all dear. Their points tally is identical now to the same stage last season, when Conte\u2019s tenure was apparently unravelling, but they have scored one goal fewer. This is a team whose identity is drifting. They had wilted before the break, blown away by Arsenal\u2019s greater intensity. Their defending was made to look flimsy by the excellence of Aaron Ramsey, Alexandre Lacazette and a workaholic Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, and a tigerish midfield. Yet, in many ways, it was the inability to recover which was more troubling. Marcos Alonso nodded against a post, the 16th time this season Chelsea have struck the woodwork, but that was as close as they came. The statisticians\u2019 insistence that the visitors had managed a first shot on target since the 64th minute against Newcastle seven days previously had felt generous, whether it referred to Ross Barkley\u2019s attempt, blocked by Laurent Koscielny, just after the hour-mark or Alonso\u2019s cross shot, pushed away by Bernd Leno, eight minutes from time. Regardless, each effort had been repelled with relative ease. It was telling that Koscielny, a player whose form had been rusty ahead of a sixth league appearance after seven months out with a ruptured achilles, looked a centre-half reborn. The days when Drogba would rampage at will in this arena, wrecking Arsenal opponents\u2019 careers en route, have never felt more distant. This was a victory to cherish for Unai Emery after a difficult week. His switch to a diamond midfield, tipped by the Juventus-bound Ramsey, proved a masterstroke, and the furious nature of the hosts\u2019 first-half display showcased Arsenal at their attacking best. The hosts might have scored three times even before, as the quarter-hour mark approached, Lacazette collected H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn\u2019s centre on his instep amid a clutter of opponents. The Frenchman, initially with his back to goal, twisted smartly away from Pedro and beyond Alonso\u2019s half-hearted attempt to block before, with the angle suddenly horribly tight, spitting away a shot which ripped high inside Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s near-post with the goalkeeper pawing at fresh air. Had they led by only one at the break, Arsenal might have been frustrated given the misses by Sokratis Papastathopoulos, Koscielny and Aubameyang. As it was, the home side would not be denied. Papastathopoulos\u2019s optimistic shot six minutes from the interval turned into an astute cross with Koscielny, stooping on the edge of the six-yard box, looping in a second improbably off his right shoulder. Emery later suggested that progress was being made on Denis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s loan arrival from Barcelona, the only sour note on a restorative evening\u2019s work a serious knee injury sustained by Beller\u00edn late on. That will need to be scanned \u201cbut first impressions are not positive\u201d. His team have already claimed more points \u2013 eight \u2013 against the top six this season than they did last, and are now hovering alongside Manchester United on Chelsea\u2019s shoulder. Both will smell blood."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
