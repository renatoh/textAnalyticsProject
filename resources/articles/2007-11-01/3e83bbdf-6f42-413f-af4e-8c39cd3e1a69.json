Some of his Labour colleagues dubbed him \"the grouchy Marxist\" because, in his humourless way, he had carried over from his previous membership of the Communist party an overdeveloped conspiracy theory attitude. He tried to persuade disbelieving Labour colleagues that I had to be \"a CIA agent\" because his suspicious mind allowed no other explanation for someone born in New York's Bronx developing such a fascination for British politicians. He was born, the son of a dressmaker and a postman, in Donaghee, County Down, Northern Ireland. The family moved to Manchester, where he attended Manley Park elementary school, Ducie Avenue central school and Manchester Junior commercial school. Leaving school at 16, over the next 30 years on Merseyside he held a number of jobs: accounts clerk, miner, fitter, signalman, office manager and civil servant. It was only after, in middle age, he acquired better academic qualifications - a diploma from Ruskin College, Oxford in 1968 and a BA Hons from Liverpool University in 1970 - that he could secure professional jobs. Between 1970 and 1974 he was a lecturer in industrial sociology at the Bolton Institute of Technology. He was never willing to disclose when he joined or when or why he left the Communist party, which bled membership in the late 1950s after the Khrushchev speech on the horrors of Stalinism and the 1956 Soviet suppression of the Hungarian rebellion. He joined the Labour party in October 1959, secure in the knowledge that with the backing of his union, ASTMS, he might finally have a political career. This began on Liverpool city council in May 1963. He captured Preston South at the February 1974 election, ousting its veteran Conservative MP, Alan Green, and helping, too, to oust Edward Heath from No 10 and allow the return of Harold Wilson. In the Commons, Thorne soon established a pattern as a leftwinger particularly hostile to defence expenditures, except for British Aerospace, which had a factory in his constituency. He opposed prevention-of-terror measures, then aimed at the Provisional IRA. As a militant trade unionist he fought against Labour's wage-control measures as well as the 1975 budget, which, he judged, would increase unemployment. In July 1975 he stormed out of a meeting of the leftwing Tribune Group in protest against Michael Foot's attempt to explain why he remained in Wilson's cabinet. Curiously, he thought he was becoming popular, allowing his name to go forward for election to Labour's national executive in 1976. He came second last. Consistent in his outlook, he helped celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Communist paper, the Morning Star, in June 1980. He blamed the death of IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands on British government \"intransigence\". He warned against the \"destructive role\" of Trotskyists in the Labour party. After the 1983 boundary changes forced him to fight and win the enlarged seat of Preston, there was no discernible change in his collection of stances, apart from coming out in January 1985 for the right of doctors to provide contraceptives for under-16s. This was after he had announced, two months before, that he would not stand again. He retired in 1987, at 69, which gave him more time for his hobbies of dancing, bridge, chess and golf. He leaves his wife, Catherine, two sons and three daughters. \u00b7 Stanley George Thorne, Labour MP, born July 22 1918; died November 26 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
