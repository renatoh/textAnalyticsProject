The Manchester City striker was doing a touchline television interview when he was the target of abuse from a supporter and engaged in a finger-pointing response, and shouted back, before being led away. \"These things happen, I don't want to make any fuss about it,\" Bellamy, the Wales captain, said. \"Maybe it was because of a few drinks. I have shown my commitment to Wales by turning up for these sorts of games, but it is me that always seems to get picked on for stick. I'm the one who turns up for games. I'm passionate about my country, maybe too passionate.\" Wales had been beaten by a late goal from Legia Warsaw's Brazil-born striker Roger Guerreiro. Guerreiro, who was given Polish citizenship last year, beat Hull City's goalkeeper Boaz Myhill \u2013 who was a couple of yards off his line \u2013 with a clever chip from outside the box. Wales had hit the bar through Joe Ledley and did not deserve to lose after a decent performance. The Wales manager, John Toshack, said: \"We are disappointed to lose a goal like that, and I am not blaming Boaz. But we gave as good as we got, they are a very strong side with a lot more experience. It was the first time we have seen these lads for three months, so with big World Cup matches coming up in March this was a good exercise.\" After several withdrawals forced him to field a very inexperienced line-up, Toshack believed the match would be beneficial to his youngsters. \"We lacked some experience against clever players who know all about the tricks of the trade, field- craft if you like,\" the Wales manager added. \"You only get to handle that by facing players like that who know their way around. Some of our lads have not been getting too much action at their clubs of late, so it was good to see people like Ched Evans doing well.\" Poland had three good early chances but Wales improved and began to make opportunities. Bellamy hooked over from 12 yards before, in the 33rd minute, curling a free-kick into the box from which Ledley produced a clever chip to clear Lukasz Fabianski, the Arsenal goalkeeper, only for the ball to bounce on to the bar. Then from a Bellamy corner David Edwards' header was cleared off the line. PA"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
