Peter Garrett, the federal education minister, who had planned to visit two schools in Brisbane, said he was stunned at the decision by Queensland education minister John-Paul Langbroek to stop him from attending. \"When permission was sought to visit Yeronga State School, minister Langbroek's office refused it,\" Garrett's office told AAP. Lanbroek\u2019s office said he was angry at the federal government\u2019s continued use of schools to promote the Gonski reforms. \"We will not allow Queensland schools to be the venue for the Gonski media roadshow,\" his office said. \"If the federal minister wants to come to Queensland and discuss Gonski, he is welcome to make time to meet minister Langbroek.\" Garrett said it was his ministerial responsibility to explain the Gonski funding reforms to school workers and parents. \"I have never been prevented from doing so until now,\" he said. Meanwhile, prime minister Julia Gillard was forced to change the venue out of a scheduled Labor funding event she was due to take part in at John Curtin College of the Arts in Fremantle, following directives from the Barnett government in Western Australia. The decision has been branded \u201coutrageous political censorship\u201d by the prime minister\u2019s office. The WA government say they were only aware the event was designed to raise funds for the party at the last minute. The prime minister was due to appear with the British novelist Ben Elton. The event will now take place at Fremantle Victoria Hall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
