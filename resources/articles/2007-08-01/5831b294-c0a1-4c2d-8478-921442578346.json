The 21-year-old, who will discover today whether he has been named in Steve McClaren's squad for the friendly against Germany on Wednesday, was told by England's goalkeeping coach, Ray Clemence, that his international career would stagnate as long as he remained second-choice at Anfield. \"I knew that I'd have no chance of playing for England if I was just No2 at Liverpool, playing Carling Cup or FA Cup games,\" admitted Carson, who enjoyed a successful loan spell at Charlton last season after he had been called up to the England squad for the 2006 World Cup. \"At the end of last season I spoke to Ray Clemence and he said: 'It's a big season for you. You need to be playing regularly.' Hopefully coming here [to Villa] will give me that opportunity. \"Hopefully I can start getting in the England senior squad more regularly, and get a few caps. It's a big season for me because of the European Championship next year. You don't know what's around the corner. If I'm playing games every week in the Premiership, it gives me a better option in case something happens along the way. Even if it's only a friendly and I get a half or something, I'd be delighted to get one cap: it would top the last couple of years off for me.\" Although Carson is keen to make the step up from the Under-21 side to the senior squad, he believes David James, one of his rivals for the three England goalkeeping positions, along with Paul Robinson, Robert Green and Chris Kirkland, ought to be in McClaren's squad. \"[James] played in the tournament in Hong Kong the other week and he was unbelievable,\" he said. \"I think he's still a top keeper and I think he's got a lot to bring [to the England squad].\" Carson, who admitted he was disappointed to have made only nine appearances for Liverpool since joining in January 2005, confirmed there is an option for Villa to make his loan move permanent at the end of the season. His arrival in the Midlands has not been welcomed by everyone at Villa, however, with Thomas Sorensen, the club's former No1, set to be fined by Martin O'Neill after he questioned the manager's decision to bring in another goalkeeper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
