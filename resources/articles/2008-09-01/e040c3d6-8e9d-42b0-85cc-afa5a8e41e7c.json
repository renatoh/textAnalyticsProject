But the intoxicating blend of blushing innocence and knowing sexuality that eroticised the girl-group pop of the early 60s, bewitched the Beatles and so obsessed Svengali producer Phil that she became first his wife, then his prisoner, is still as potent as ever. Taking to the stage after a brief retro workout by her six-piece band, Spector's leg-skimming flared jeans belie her years, while her tousled mane displays her glamorous roots. When she sings, however, the voice that broke a million hearts shakes uncomfortably, overpowered by the stomping rhythm of the Ronettes' I Wonder. But Spector's smile never fades, through the frustration-laden Why Don't They Let Us Fall in Love? to the burnt-out 70s sigh of Billy Joel's Say Goodbye to Hollywood. Big names and famous fans fill her affectionate reminisces, and she wraps Amy Winehouse's Back to Black in authentic class. The longer she sings, the stronger her voice becomes, and she glides through the doo-wop of the Schoolboys' Please Say You Want Me. This Is an End, from her latest album, reveals her tough, sultry side, her shirt undone to expose a Madonna-esque basque. Ronnie the romantic is less assured, though, and her faltering vocals fail to set the classic Be My Baby alight. But her charm remains undiminished, and with the help of the smitten crowd, she pulls through."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
