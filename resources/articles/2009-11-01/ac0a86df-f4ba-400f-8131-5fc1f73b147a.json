The England spinner, 27, who is currently in Johannesburg playing for Highveld Lions, joined Sussex on a three-year deal this week having endured a disappointing season in which he had lost his central contract. \"I felt Northants were no longer working with me to become an England player,\" he said yesterday, when the opening one-day international between England and South Africa was abandoned without a ball being bowled. \"The bizarre thing is that they have also lost Graeme White to Notts, so they have lost two England-qualified, locally-produced players in favour of Nicky Boje, a South African. It was down to money. They had budgeted for me being an ECB centrally contracted player. They also have Boje as captain. I thought that I needed to be playing a dominant role in the team's success, and being made to feel welcome is part of the process.\" Panesar, at one time a match-winning bowler for England, became something of a cult figure in the team with his black patka, his maladroit fielding and his comical celebrations after taking a wicket. He has come to South Africa, where he did township work in January, to rediscover his form before the domestic season. \"I loved playing for Northants. I regarded it as my home club but I had to go to where I was most wanted, and where it was best for my cricket in the short, medium and the long term,\" he said. \"Sussex has a good support staff and has a reputation for having a family feel to it. They are successful. I like the captain, Michael Yardy, too. I roomed him with him with England A. He was really keen for me to go to Sussex and replace Mushy [Mushtaq Ahmed] as a match-winning spinner.\" But Northamptonshire, where Panesar spent 10 years, and who turned him into an England player, challenged his comments last night. David Capel, the coach of the Division Two club, said: \"I don't thinkthey're fair. Monty played just about every match for us last season and we worked very hard on his game. He was usually our first spinner in the team although Graeme White was pushing him hard at times.We did persist with him although he bowled over 400 overs and took only 18 wickets at nearly 60 apiece. \"The club and everyone here was working with him to get him back in the England team. What he might have been alluding to is that our wickets here at Northampton have changed in character. They are no longer spinning tracks but have more pace and bounce.\" When Northants did produce a spinning surface for their game against Kent, James Tredwell - who has just joined the England party here - took 10 wickets in the match while Panesar took two. Panesar cannot have felt that bitter about his treatment at Northampton because when he left he donated \u00a310,000 to the club as a mark of gratitude. The move though would appear to be the best solution for all parties. Panesar struggled on his Lions debut this month, taking two for 131 as Eastern Cape Warriors piled up 532. \"But I found my rhythm and took some wickets in my second match in Cape Town,\" he said. \"Coming here is the start of the process to get back in the England team. I don't feel I have been forgotten.\" His first wicket in Test cricket was that of Sachin Teldulkar in 2006 and when he took 23 wickets at 18.13 in four Tests against West Indies in 2007 his place had looked secure for years to come. But his problems started in Sri Lanka two years ago, when he took eight wickets in three Tests at 50.63 apiece.Perhaps it was the heavy rain that has been falling here for three days now - or it might have been the virus infection that has made him unwell in recent days - but Panesar was in an introspective mood. Before that disappointing series Panesar had been due to play club cricket in Colombo, but the arrangement fell through. \"That was the start of the phase when things went not as If I had gone to Sri Lanka I would have been in a better place. Then, in India last winter, I did not have much chance to prepare and suddenly there was a Test match. I was up against Sachin Tendulkar. It felt like being up against a heavyweight boxer in his own ring. There was only to be so many rounds I was going to last. It went downhill then, bit by bit. But I'm determined to play for England again, in Test and one-day cricket.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
