The Guardian has learned that the University of St Andrews \u2013 one of the UK\u2019s leading higher education institutions \u2013 is among those facing a black hole in its accounts due to the pandemic. In response to the crisis, Universities UK (UUK) has proposed a series of measures to the government that would double research funding and offer emergency loans to troubled institutions, as well as placing a cap on the number of undergraduates many institution can recruit in 2020-21. The government will embrace UUK\u2019s public support for limiting student recruitment, which would reduce its losses from unpaid student loans. The Guardian revealed last month that ministers were pushing universities to consider a cap. The proposal would result in universities in England and Wales temporarily capping their UK and EU undergraduate intake at the forecasts that they have already submitted, plus a maximum increase of 5%. Students already holding firm conditional offers will be guaranteed their places if they meet their grade requirements. Sources at several leading universities say they expect the falls in international student numbers and research grants next year alone to cost them hundreds of millions of pounds, while lost income from conferences, accommodation and catering will drain \u00a3790m from the sector by the end of summer. St Andrews\u2019 principal, Sally Mapstone, warned her staff on Thursday that the university had already lost \u00a325m as a direct result of the coronavirus crisis, which would force it into significant cost-cutting. \u201cIt is as serious a financial crisis as our university has faced in modern times, and it will mean that we cannot do everything you want or expect us to, and that we have to take some very difficult decisions about our future,\u201d Mapstone said. The proposal by UUK, representing 137 institutions, gives dire warnings of the financial difficulties in which many universities find themselves, with campuses shut and students abruptly leaving. \u201cWithout government support, some universities would face financial failure, others would come close to financial failure and be forced to reduce provision. Some will be in places where they are the only local higher education provider with damaging impact on the local community and economy,\u201d states the document agreed by vice-chancellors on Wednesday. Alistair Jarvis, UUK\u2019s chief executive, said it was without question that British universities were likely to go bankrupt without further support: \u201cThere is a very significant chance of some institutions going bust \u2013 and part of this proposal is to prevent that from happening.\u201d But its plans were attacked by the University and College Union as \u201cpiecemeal\u201d measures that fail to fix the sector\u2019s weaknesses. \u201cUniversities need to step back from the dog-eat-dog approach of recent times and come together properly in the wider interest. We fear these proposals risk leaving many universities vulnerable,\u201d said Jo Grady, UCU\u2019s general secretary. The UUK scheme also offers to \u201creduce costs, increase efficiency and moderate certain behaviours\u201d such as curbing unconditional offers, as well delaying capital spending and freezing recruitment. It also calls for a \u201ctransformation fund\u201d to \u201creshape and consolidate\u201d the sector through mergers. Its requests include doubling quality-related government research funding from \u00a32bn to \u00a34bn a year, as well as assistance for universities relying on \u201cvery high numbers\u201d of international students. Others include giving universities unrestricted access to the UK government\u2019s coronavirus business support programmes. Vice-chancellors also want the government to make a multi-year commitment to offering loans and financial support for institutions \u201csuffering significant income losses\u201d. UUK warned that the loss of valuable international student fees would end the ability of universities to cross-subsidise expensive science and technology research. Jarvis said losses would hamper their ability to conduct research into pandemics in the long term. Scottish university sources said their crisis was more acute because of Scotland\u2019s government not fully funding the costs of teaching local students, despite its policy of not charging tuition fees. That increased their dependency on overseas student income. University leaders say privately that they do not expect the governments to agree to all the proposals, with some fearing that ministers will \u201ccherry-pick\u201d the least expensive options."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
