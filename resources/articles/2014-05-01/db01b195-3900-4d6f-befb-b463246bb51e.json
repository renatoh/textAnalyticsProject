The Brighton manager has had an uneasy relationship with the club's board since he was appointed last summer and a parting of the ways seems inevitable after he informed them of his desire to leave in the aftermath of the defeat to Steve McLaren's side. Although Brighton remain supportive of Garc\u00eda, who sought assurances that funds will be made available this summer, and stressed that they want him to stay, he is unlikely to change his mind and has already told his players that he may not be there next season. Garc\u00eda's desire to find a new challenge will not come as a surprise to Brighton, who have been aware of his dissatisfaction for a while. He believes that they were held back this season by a lack of investment in both transfer windows and the situation was not helped when Ashley Barnes was sold to Burnley and Liam Bridcutt moved to Sunderland in January. Barnes and Bridcutt were both key members of Garc\u00eda's squad and the 41-year-old's concern about the direction in which the club was heading grew after they were not adequately replaced. An extensive injury list added to Garc\u00eda's problems but after a difficult start to the season, he helped Brighton finish sixth and snatch the last play-off spot after they beat Nottingham Forest on the final day of the Championship season. Yet the manner of the defeat to Derby, who beat Brighton 6-2 on aggregate, forced him to evaluate his position. However Brighton may justifiably argue that they are a club on the rise. The move to The Amex Stadium in 2011 has enabled them to compete at a higher level and they will also move to a new \u00a329m training ground this summer, which will enable them to improve their infrastructure and their youth academy. If Garc\u00eda leaves, then he is unlikely to be short of potential suitors. His youth, association with Barcelona and commitment to attacking, possession-based football makes him an attractive candidate. Garc\u00eda, who led Maccabi Tel Aviv to the Israeli title in the 2012-13 season after a spell coaching Barcelona's Under-19s, favours a move to the Premier League or La Liga and it is understood that West Ham, who may sack Sam Allardyce this week, and Aston Villa have both been watching his progress with interest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
