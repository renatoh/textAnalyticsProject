Commentators said that the question was not whether South Africa deserved the World Cup, but whether the World Cup deserved South Africa. Which makes it all the more dismaying, just seven weeks later, to see a country once more at unease with itself. Tens of thousands of people are back on the streets, this time not with smiles and vuvuzelas, but with placards and songs of anger. A massive state workers' strike has crippled schools and hospitals. Tales abound of a needless loss of life, pregnant mothers turned away from hospital gates, premature babies left unattended, nurses receiving death threats for crossing picket lines and children being abused for trying to learn. Even the national health minister has been forced to work a night shift to keep hospitals running. South Africa's powerful unions say there is a simple way to end this painful impasse: pay a decent wage. Their demand is way above inflation, but they argue that if the governing African National Congress (ANC) can afford a World Cup, as well as luxury cars and hotels for its ministers, then surely it can keep its promise to reward the nation's nurses and teachers. President Jacob Zuma is under attack from another constituency. His government has proposed new laws that would broaden the definition of official secrets, with whistleblowers and journalists who infringe them facing up to 25 years in prison. The outcry has been resolute, with comparisons drawn with the censorship of the apartheid era or Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe. Opponents note the words of government minister Blade Nzimande, who said the media are always \"looking for bad news out of the ANC and its alliance partners... we have no opposition other than the bourgeois media\". And of the ANC's youth wing, which called for the immediate establishment of a media tribunal \"to save our organisations and leadership from repeated attempts to assassinate their characters and sow divisions\". It appears the media's sin is to have repeatedly exposed the corrupt activities of politicians and, in a country where one party remains dominant, played a vital role in holding them accountable. None of this is cause to despair in a teenage democracy that swings from rainbow nation optimism to hysterical pessimism and then back again. But it should concentrate minds in the party that Mandela led to power with such hope in 1994. Great tournaments won't appease the unions' sense of betrayal, nor the 43% of the population who survive on no more than \u00a31.50 a day, nor the half of black youth who cannot find work. Cronyism, graft and lavish living are indefensible in a society that competes with Brazil for the title of most unequal in the world. The threats to the media \u2013 one journalist was recently arrested over a story he had not even published \u2013 smack of diversionary tactics when the social and economic imperatives are so pressing. The ANC, admired by democrats around the world, is surely bigger and better than that. Having welcomed the praise of the international community for South Africa's marvellous hosting of the World Cup, it should now heed criticism of actions that are squandering the goodwill."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
