Having promised not to introduce university top-up fees in its last election manifesto, the Labour party did precisely the opposite in its review of higher education funding last Wednesday. The education secretary, Charles Clarke, maintained that the government had remained true to its word because the changes would come into effect only after the next election, but since the legislation is to be introduced, debated and passed in the current parliament, this was transparent sophistry. The rights and wrongs of top-up fees are debated fully elsewhere in this section, but the financial implications bear closer scrutiny. All universities will be allowed to charge top-up fees of up to \u00a33,000 per year: students won't be asked to pay up-front, but instead will have to repay them on graduation at a rate of 9p in the pound on all earnings over \u00a315,000. The government suggests that students will actually be better off, as the repayment threshold for loans is currently set much lower, at \u00a310,000. This is disingenuous. Student debt is set to more than double, from about \u00a310,000 to \u00a321,000. This will still have to be repaid in full regardless of earnings; all the increase in threshold means is that graduates will be a little less broke for much, much longer. Graduates are also likely to have to defer house-buying, and will almost certainly not contemplate contributing to a pension until well into their thirties. The government suggests that students should regard their degree as an upfront pension in itself - a ticket to higher earnings. For those taking a job with Goldman Sachs, this is unquestionably true; those choosing to work in the public sector might disagree. On the same day that the higher education funding review was published, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) released its Risk Outlook for 2003. With the average household having debts - excluding a mortgage - of \u00a35,000, the report makes interesting reading. \"Some consumers don't seem to be thinking ahead sufficiently prudently when deciding how much to borrow and how much to save. This could cost them dearly in the long run,\" said FSA managing director Carol Sergeant. \"Borrowing by consumers in the UK has been growing at an unsustainable rate, and some segments of the population are already having difficulty meeting their debt commitments. The results could be lower overall economic growth, hardship for consumers, and increased credit risks for lenders.\" Curiously, no one in government has seen fit to explain its higher education proposals in the context of the FSA report. Far from reducing the burden of debt, the government is suggesting that graduates should quadruple it. If current levels of debt are already unsustainable, how can this be justified? It seems self-evident that the prospect of taking on such a high level of debt would be far more likely to deter students from poorer backgrounds from going to university. To stave off criticisms of elitism, the DfES has reintroduced a limited maintenance grant. From 2004, students from families earning less than \u00a310,000 a year will qualify for a grant of \u00a31,000; those from families with an income of between \u00a310,000 and \u00a320,000 will receive something as yet unspecified. In his speech to the Commons, Clarke indicated that roughly 30% of students would qualify for the full maintenance grant; how he arrived at these figures is unclear. Neither the Treasury nor the Department for Work and Pensions was able to provide a figure for the number of households earning less than \u00a310,000. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) promised to phone back if it came up with a figure: no call was received. The only vaguely helpful figure on the ONS website was that of 13.4% for out-of-work households with dependent children. Even if Clarke's figure is right, it is, to some extent, irrelevant. Even allowing for the government to achieve its figure of 50% of 18- to 30-year-olds to experience higher education by 2010, it is reasonable to assume that the vast majority of those who don't go to university will come from lower-earning families. One can also assume that a grant of \u00a31,000 will provide a meagre incentive for the poorest students, given the high levels of debt that will accompany it. In other words, the government might set aside some \u00a3300m a year for grant payments, but it is unlikely to make a major impact. Maintenance grants are guaranteed only until 2006. So while they might go up, it is also possible they will be abolished once more as the new funding regime gets up and running. Either way, it's hardly a solid commitment. It is also not entirely clear how things are going to work on a macro-economic level. The government has promised to increase state funding for universities from \u00a37.6bn to \u00a39.9bn by 2006. Yet there is no indication what level of state finance will be made available for higher education once the new regime kicks in. A DfES press officer said: \"The government will pay the students' tuition fees upfront and the Treasury will claw back the money over time.\" Nor is there any real sense of whether the new arrangements will put right the \u00a38bn black hole of under-investment in university funding. Things will undoubtedly improve, but there are no figures available to say by how much. There is more than a suggestion that the figure of \u00a33,000 in fees was decided upon according to what the electorate would tolerate rather than by what was actually needed. In fairness, similar criticisms were raised when Australia switched to fees in 1989, and - a few hiccups excepted - its system works much better. However, it is open to question whether Australian universities were previously in such a precarious financial position. The white paper encourages universities to seek other free-market sources of funding and will allow taxpayers to offset donations to universities against tax through Giftaid. No guesstimated figures for this are put forward. All told, it's hard to know what difference the new scheme is going to make. The government has already admitted that its primary numeracy strategy has failed: one rather fears its higher education numeracy strategy is heading in the same direction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
