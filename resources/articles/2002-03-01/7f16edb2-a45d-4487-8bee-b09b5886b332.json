At one end is the thriving La Houssini\u00e8re, with its ferry port, fish-packing plant, campsite, beach, smug locals and resident scheming businessman. To get around (there's a twee map in the front of this book), you might try hiring a bicycle from the stereotypical patron of the Chat Noir cafe, who is looking at you narrowly as he leans in his doorway smoking a Gitane. \"Bof,\" he will say with a Gallic shrug. \"I have no bicycles. What for should I have bicycles?\" Boo to him, and to all those other stuck-up Houssins, too. Boo! On the other side of the island is Les Salants, not so much a village as a row of dilapidated fishermen's cottages menaced by coastal erosion and populated by gloomy old coves. Like their enemies across the island, the Salannais are much given to saying \"Bof\", shrugging, smoking Gitanes and sinking their moustaches into the local hard stuff, le devinnoise, or nibbling the local pastries, les devinnoiseries. And yet these unpromising, fish-poor, beach-bereft, dispirited folk are our heroes. Hurrah! And the tide is going to turn for them, quite literally, and they will get their revenge on the Houssins. Quite literally! Such, at least, is the simplistic ethico-physical terrain that Harris has mapped out in her new novel. At the outset she has the gall to say that Le Devin has \"a character entirely its own, dialects, food, traditions, dress all as different from the other islands as they are from mainland France\". But this character remains unexpressed in the rest of the book (except for the above-mentioned delicacies and a loose-fitting nautical top, which hardly constitute a cultural identity). Rather, Le Devin remains a little bit of rustic France uncontaminated by reality; it is not beset by ethnic strife, congestion, dog crap, nuclear power plants, encroaching globalisation, or indeed intellectual life - those characteristics of the real modern France. In this, Coastliners ' chief appeal is to those Channel-hopping Britons who want to visit France, strip-mine it of its fine wines and fruit tarts, and return home blissfully ignorant of what it is really like. But at least Harris is consistent: in her trilogy of food novels, she created a commodified and stereotypical rural France, seductive to those who enjoyed Peter Mayle or who want second homes in a country that they don't really want to understand. She has created a literary sub-genre, as lucrative as chick- or lad-lit, though more cynical than all but the worst examples of either. Brittany Ferries should sponsor her; the French government should take out a contract on her to stop her writing books that drive Britons - quite literally - to settle in Cahors or Provence. The drama starts when Madeleine (Mado) Prasteau, a painter from Paris, comes to the island armed with sketchpad and big-city sass. Harris's fans will recognise this opening gambit - the outsider who descends on a cutesy backwater and shakes things up - because she's played it three times before. In her Whitbread-shortlisted Chocolat, Vianne Rocher arrived in the sleepy village of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes, opened a chocolate shop and seduced all the Catholics into her pagan world of pleasure. In the sequel, Blackberry Wine, jaded Jay Mackintosh, a second-rate English sci-fi writer, moved to Lansquenet from England, inspired by the eponymous drink. And in Five Quarters of the Orange, Framboise arrived at a little Loire-side village to set up a restaurant using a recipe book written by her mother. Like Framboise, Mado is no stranger to her village. She finds her childhood home threatened, both by the sea and by the machinations of the aforementioned businessman, whom Harris describes as having a \"bombastic moustache\" and a voice \"as rich and expensive as good wine\". If we can imagine him at all, it is as a caricature who cannot grow beyond the limits Harris has set him. Distressingly, this is true of all her characters. It is wicked Brismand who has deprived Les Salants of its beach and threatened the Salannais with oblivion. His expensive breakwater shelters La Houssini\u00e8re's beach, that generator of tourism and wealth. But thanks to a charismatic Irish drifter called Flynn, Mado manages to change all that. Together they galvanise the Salannais to build a reef of old tyres and concrete to change the tide for Les Salants, thus proving several tired adages all at once, namely \"No man is an island\" (Harris quotes this at the start), \"To see a world in a grain of sand...\" (this too), and the one about stuff always coming back. You know - tides, karma. This is ghastly enough, but the romantic storyline is worse. Even those who don't read Mills &amp; Boon will detect early that Flynn, the tousle-haired eye-candy who harbours A Secret, will impress his charms on Mado at some point during this chunky book. After all, most of the other contenders are small, unattractive and quite possibly inbred. The only question is when Harris, unskilled at the arousing dynamics of sexual deferral in romantic fiction, will get the pair to get it on. This takes too many pages, during which she allows Mado, who narrates, to deploy a few clunking nautico-erosion figures to account for her growing interest. Flynn causes \"a gradual erosion of my defences which left me baffled\". Later, she finds his mysteriousness seductive: \"It was unsettling, like a shadow under deep water. Nevertheless, like all deeps it drew me.\" By a strange equivalence, like all shallows, Harris's book repels me. It doesn't (and this is the worst thing one can say of it) have the courage of its own cynicism. It refuses to plunge properly into genre fiction but remains sniffily aloof, convinced that it is true literature, rather than pulp. Like someone getting belated compunctions at an orgy, Harris is irksome company. But then, Harris is not writing for me. Who is she writing for? The French? Hardly. They would despise her vision of their homeland. There are French writers such as Philippe Delerm and Daniel Pennac - of negligible popularity this side of the Channel - who get all gooey about a hackneyed France. But when, say, Delerm eulogises the Tour de France or the first mouthful of French beer, his writing is charged with real feeling and love for France. Nothing so fond or so appealing animates Coastliners. No matter. The film rights to Coastliners have been sold and Harris will write the script. It remains only to suggest the cast. Hopefully, Juliette Binoche (who starred in the yucky film of Chocolat) will not be available, and instead it could be acted entirely by non-French people. Dame Judi could reprise her irascible coastal local from the adaptation of The Shipping News; Flynn could be barrel-chested Brendan Fraser in a curly red wig; Mado could be Jennifer Aniston from Friends with a daft accent; all those aesthetically challenged EastEnders extras could play the islanders. The French would hate it, as would anyone else who loves France, but it would make a great deal of money for Harris. And that is the important thing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
