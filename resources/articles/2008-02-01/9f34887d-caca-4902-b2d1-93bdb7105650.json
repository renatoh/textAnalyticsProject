Hawaii, where the Illinois senator grew up, is not a surprise, but the margin of victory in Wisconsin is. This is classic Hillary Clinton territory: blue-collar, white, old-school Democrat. She should have won there - or, at the very least, lost respectably. Instead, she was hammered. Listen to John McCain's speech after his own election victories Tuesday, and he's clearly decided the primary season is over. From now on in, he'll be campaigning against Obama, critiquing his foreign policy, casting doubt on his ability to defend America from terrorism. Over the last few months, Obama's had something of a gentle ride from the media and fellow politicians. Now that he's the frontrunner, however, he's started to come in for some sustained attacks, some raising valid questions, others far more nebulous. In recent weeks several commentators have run with Clinton's argument that Obama's nothing but a great orator. In his victory speech, McCain picked up where Clinton left off. The attack is two-fold: first, that there's no substance behind the words (a line of reasoning I have some, though not too much, sympathy with, and which I wrote about from Nevada a month ago, back when Edwards was still in the race and still coming up with damn fine, nuts-and-bolts policy ideas). It's a claim Obama, whose campaign has generally avoided dealing with nitty-gritty policy specifics that might alienate some of his fan-base, hasn't fully refuted. The second part of the argument seems to me weirder, and it is that great speechifying is inherently dangerous - that somehow there's a Hitler waiting to be unleashed inside every hypnotically good orator. Now that's disingenuous. What makes a dangerous demagogue isn't the ability to speak well, but the ability to say terrible things and articulate diabolical visions in a way seductive enough to capture the hearts and minds of the multitudes. Let's get real: Obama's not in that category. He tends to say the right things well - albeit in a slightly vague, hazy sort of way, that leaves few hostages to fortune in its wake. And while that might be maddening to opponents, it's an entirely different story from that of the dangerous, evil cult leader. In disturbing and perilous moments in a nation's journey, it is the ability to mobilise through words as much as specific policies that can often make the difference between success and failure. Witness the role of Winston Churchill's rhetoric in shoring up the UK populace's resolution in the days leading up to and during the blitz. Sure, Britain's arms factories had to survive the bombs, the infrastructure had to be repaired at breakneck speed and tough policies had to be implemented, but would any of that have been enough to withstand the Nazi assault had the country's spirit been broken? Probably not. That it wasn't was at least in part due to the power of oratory. Think how many old men and women today can still quote the ringing words they heard Churchill utter while they huddled around their radios waiting for the bombs to fall. Think how many young people, who might know nothing about the details of the second world war, can conjure up phrases like \"we shall never surrender\" - even if they don't know who authored the fabled words. Fast forward 20 years. John F Kennedy was peculiarly important in American history not because he was a particularly effective administrator - in terms of their respective handles on the legislative process, Lyndon Johnson ran rings around him, as did Richard Nixon - but because at a critical moment in US history, when the country was veering toward a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, he captured a yearning for change. And in capturing that spirit, marshalling it, focusing the energies of a generation, he set in motion the cultural transformation that ultimately led to what we think of when we conjure up images of the 60s. Kennedy's inaugural speech was one of those fulcrum moments via which a generation can divide time. There was a before and there was an after. (Of course, tragically, his subsequent assassination marked an even bigger before and after moment for that same generation.) Similarly, Martin Luther King Jr became so pre-eminently important because the power of his spoken words was such that it forced America to look itself in the mirror, to explore whether it really was living up to its highest ideals. Absent the speeches of MLK, in particular his I Have a Dream speech, the civil rights movement might have sputtered to a halt in the early 1960s, or, alternatively it could have taken a much more violent, nihilistic turn during this period, as indeed it did in the latter part of the decade and the 1970s when King was no longer around to steer it. Mario Savio's 1964 peroration outside UC Berkeley's Sproul Hall, the famous words that summed up the goals of Berkeley's free speech movement and set the stage for the campus upheavals of the second half of the 1960s, is still quoted and written about, not because Savio was a strategic genius but because he was an utterly magnetic speaker, throwing his words out before an agitated audience hungry for change. The idea that a president only needs to be a competent administrator fundamentally misunderstands the role of the commander in chief. Of course a president needs to be competent - the lack of effective government response to, say, the destruction of New Orleans throws that necessity into stark relief. But that's only a baseline. He also has to be a mouthpiece for a vision as much as a specific set of policies, for like it or not the presidential system personalises politics, and personalises how the rest of the world views America. That so many people are utterly aghast at the United States at the moment is in part because George Bush's Texas swagger and the actions accompanying it, as well as his inability to articulate orally a vision beyond simplistic good versus evil soundbites, come off so badly on the international stage. We can assume that both Clinton and Obama would surround themselves with first-rate brains, and that that network of brains, rather than the individual experience, or lack thereof, of the president would make and shape public policy. After all, both Clinton and Obama would have access to, and would use, some of the finest political strategists and thinkers around. We can assume that after eight years of White House cronyism, we'd see something of a return to competent administration. Should Obama or Clinton, or for that matter McCain, take the oath of office next January, better governance would be a top priority. But along with better governance will be the pressing need for a renewed civic spirit, for a roll-back of a culture of cynicism that increasingly assumes misrule and unresponsiveness to be the currency of Washington's political realm, and for an ability to better communicate a vision to people both domestically and overseas. And this leads back to personality. Charisma has always played something of a central role in American politics. Lincoln, FDR, JFK and Bill Clinton all had charisma up the wazzoo. Hillary Clinton's attacks on Obama for being all mouth and no muscle are particularly ironic given the fact that Bill Clinton won office, and then won it again, at least in part because he was a damned good speaker, the sort of wordsmith who gave audiences chills, a man who made people feel better about themselves just by listening to him. Remember Bill, accepting his party's nomination in 1992, ending his speech with the line: \"I still believe in a place called Hope?\" Or his impassioned election-eve rally when he was so hoarse he could hardly do more than croak out his words? Great speechifying has always been, and will always be, important in democratic politics, not just in America but globally. Of course there has to be substance behind the words, but to attack Obama simply because he's a fine speaker, well that's below the belt.
