There were 85 fires burning across NSW on Tuesday, and 42 were uncontrolled. With predictions of temperatures surpassing 40C and a wind change for the afternoon, firefighters expected conditions to deteriorate. About 2,700 firefighters are in the field, many from volunteer NSW Rural Fire Service brigades. As smoke brought the city\u2019s air quality to more than 11 times the hazardous level, Scott Morrison spoke in Sydney about the religious discrimination bill. Asked about concerns over how long the tens of thousands of volunteer firefighters \u2013 many who have been away from work for weeks now \u2013 were expected to continue without pay, Morrison said they \u201cwant to be there\u201d. \u201cThese fires have been going on for some months now and when I was speaking with the commissioner on the weekend out where we have the megafire at the moment we were talking through the crew rotations,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the fact is these crews, yes, they\u2019re tired, but they also want to be out there defending their communities. And so we do all we can to rotate the shifts to give them those breaks but \u2026 in many cases you\u2019ve got to hold them back to make sure they get that rest. And I thank them all for what they\u2019re doing, particularly all those who support them.\u201d He rejected suggestions that volunteer firefighters \u2013 who reportedly make up the largest volunteer firefighting force in the world \u2013 should be professionalised. \u201cThe volunteer effort is a big part of our natural disaster response and it is a big part of how Australia has always dealt with these issues,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cWe are constantly looking at ways to better facilitate the volunteer effort, but to professionalise that at that scale is not a matter that has previously been accepted and it\u2019s not currently under consideration by the government.\u201d There are reports of RFS brigades crowdfunding or seeking donations for water and food for those in the field. Morrison did not address that and he rejected suggestions there was more the federal government could do. He said state governments get everything they request from the commonwealth, whether that was logistics and support or assistance from the Australian defence force. \u201cI know what the practice is and I know what the experience is and I know what\u2019s happening on the ground and I know that whether it\u2019s the ADF or any other agency of the commonwealth, all of those agencies, our efforts have been \u2026 directed and channelled into the response of the state and territory staff on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what was intended to be set up and that is operating, and I\u2019m pleased with the way those arrangements are being worked out. And if there is any other matter that would need to be addressed, it would be raised with the commonwealth, because there is a direct line to make sure that happens.\u201d The government has rejected a call from the independent MP Andrew Wilkie to use air force transport planes to waterbomb. Morrison also rejected calls by the opposition and by his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, for a nationally coordinated response to the fires. Turnbull said emergency management in Australia needed to be restructured because the threat was now a \u201cnational security issue\u201d. \u201cThe national government has to provide leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously the federal government can\u2019t do everything but the federal government\u2019s job is to lead and this is an issue that needs leadership.\u201d Morrison said there already was a \u201cnationally coordinated effort\u201d which he did not think could go any higher. \u201cIt\u2019s led by a cabinet minister who reports directly to me and I deal with it directly with the premiers of the states and chief ministers of the territories,\u201d he said. The Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council (Afac) said cross-state firefighting resources were funnelled and distributed across the country where they had been requested, by its national resource sharing centre. \u201cWhile many volunteers are not available to travel far from their homes or interstate due to local responsibilities, employment or managing drought-stricken stock that require daily feeding, others are prepared to deploy,\u201d Afac said. It said there was integrated engagement with the commonwealth and national protocols for managing incident responses and the available fleet of 140 aircraft and international personnel. \u201cAustralia has never been better prepared to face natural disasters,\u201d it said. Leading scientists said this week that the fires should be a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the government about the lack of focus on the climate crisis, with climate experts telling Guardian Australia they were \u201cbewildered\u201d how little attention the emergency had been given during the last parliamentary sitting week of the year. Last month a coalition of former climate chiefs said the government \u201cfundamentally doesn\u2019t like talking about climate change\u201d and that it had ignored their advice for political reasons. The group of 23 fire and other emergency chiefs had tried to meet with Morrison since April, but said they had been \u201clocked out\u201d of discussions. On Tuesday Morrison said the government\u2019s climate change policy was in the \u201csensible centre\u201d of balancing environmental and economic needs, and was meeting emissions reductions targets. \u201cOur actions on climate change are getting the results they\u2019re intended to get,\u201d he said. Australia is not on track to meet its emissions targets without using carryover credits from the Kyoto period, an accounting trick other nations have ruled out using and which is being challenged by about 100 countries at the UN climate talks in Madrid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
