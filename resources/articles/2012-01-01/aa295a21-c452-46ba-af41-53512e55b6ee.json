Their 11th league win of the season \u2013 out of 12 \u2013 might have been in the bag but, after a festive holiday of mixed performances, Conor O'Shea's side has plenty to think about before they head for Northampton on Friday. After losing their unbeaten record to Saracens at Twickenham last Tuesday, the league leaders came within six minutes of a second defeat in four days at Exeter. And Northampton, suddenly third in the table and on something of a roll, will not be slow to pick up on the lesson the Chiefs handed out when it came to scrummaging. If the Harlequins pack plays as poorly at Franklin's Gardens as it did for an hour at Sandy Park, then it is hard to see them escaping unscathed against a team who have taken 27 points from their last seven games, pride themselves on the power of their pack and have lost only once in the league since September. Until the 127kg (20st) frame of James Johnston joined the fray on Saturday, the Harlequins front row, including Joe Marler and Joe Gray, two of many Harlequins being mentioned for possible inclusion in Stuart Lancaster's squad for the Six Nations, were all over the shop against Exeter's experienced scrummagers and probably escaped lightly at the hands of the referee JP Doyle. Harlequins further contributed to their own difficulties by having a kicker who wasted 14 points before landing the penalty which snatched the game from under the Exeter noses. Rory Clegg will be 22 on Friday and will hope for a better performance than missing five of his first six kicks. That he landed the seventh says much about the No10's character on a day made difficult for kickers, as Exeter's replacement fly-half Gareth Steenson found out when he attempted the drop goal which would have retaken the lead with only two minutes to go. In fact O'Shea praised Clegg's \"bottle\" insisting that the former Newcastle man, currently in the side because Quins' former All Black, Nick Evans, has a damaged hand, was \"an 80%-plus goal kicker\" having an off day.
