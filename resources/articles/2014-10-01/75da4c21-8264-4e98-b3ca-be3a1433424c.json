She rather undermines her case, though, by appearing on the cover of her third album in bra and pants \u2013 as if that volcanic voice needs a helping hand after the relative flop of her last album. Further training her sights on America, she\u2019s constructed Sweet Talker to fit a gap somewhere between Beyonc\u00e9 and Pink. The latter is conjured up in Masterpiece and Said Too Much, which are heavy with pop-rock melodrama and strength-from-within ruminating; elsewhere, the brash R&amp;B of Burnin\u2019 Up (listen for guest 2 Chainz being thoroughly upstaged) and Seal Me With a Kiss (featuring De La Soul, who utter the word \u201cbloke\u201d as if it\u2019s in a foreign language) will win over US radio programmers. Your enjoyment will hinge on how you feel about the strained earnestness of her delivery \u2013 it\u2019s notable that the best moments come when she uncouples herself from it and just sings for the joy of it, as on the brilliant, fizzy pop banger Bang Bang, a deserved No 1 this summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
