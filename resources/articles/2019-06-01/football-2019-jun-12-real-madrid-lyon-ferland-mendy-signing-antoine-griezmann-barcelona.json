While across the city, the Atl\u00e9tico chief executive, Miguel \u00c1ngel Gil Mar\u00edn, believes Antoine Griezmann will join Barcelona this summer \u2013 and insisted he has known about the move since March. Real announced on Wednesday that Mendy will sign a six-year contract, with Lyon saying the transfer was worth \u20ac48m (\u00a342.7m). The 24-year-old\u2019s signing comes a week after Real also bought Eden Hazard from Chelsea for \u00a388.5m and the forward Luka Jovic from Eintracht Frankfurt for \u00a365m. Mendy joined Lyon from Le Harve in 2017 and scored three goals in 44 appearances last season. He made his debut for France in a friendly against Uruguay in November. Griezmann announced last month he would leave Atl\u00e9tico this summer after spending five seasons in the Spanish capital. Barcelona have long been linked with a move for the France forward and the 28-year-old has a release clause in his contract that the Spanish champions are reportedly ready to trigger. While no official offer has been made, Gil Mar\u00edn said he has been aware of Griezmann\u2019s next destination for the last three months. \u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear where he is going to play, I\u2019ve known since March. At Barcelona,\u201d he told the Spanish TV station Movistar Toros on Wednesday. Griezmann moved to Atl\u00e9tico from Real Sociedad in 2014 and helped the club win the Europa League in 2018, scoring twice in the final against Marseille. Earlier on Wednesday, Jovic was officially unveiled at the Bernab\u00e9u, the striker declaring that he was the \u201chappiest man in the world\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
