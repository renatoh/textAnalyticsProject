In 2005 the club was born from the disgruntlement of some Manchester United followers at the Malcolm Glazer buyout. On Monday night the emotion fuelled the \u201cUnhappy Mondays\u201d stance taken against the switch from Saturday for the tie to be broadcast on television. A team featuring plasterers and mechanics were roared on by a support brandishing a banner reading \u201cI Don\u2019t Like Mondays\u201d and chanting \u201cFuck BT Sport\u201d while others showed dissent by remaining outside until the second half. Within seven minutes United were rocked. Sylvan Ebanks-Blake, who played twice for Manchester United and scored once, pulled the ball back to Gboly Ariyibi and the American beat David Carnell to give Chesterfield the lead. FC\u2019s 3-1 reverse to Telford last Tuesday was a sixth consecutive defeat in the Conference North. As the programme stated, this is a \u201cclub record\u201d and what occurred next did little to suggest United might come back from the deficit. The visiting left-back, Dan Jones, scooted along his flank and pinged in a cross that Lee Novak met with his right boot to beat Carnell. To the home fans\u2019 credit their singing continued and enough bonhomie remained for those behind Tommy Lee\u2019s goal to inform the main stand of where they might go, as there is a friendly rivalry between the two sections. There was, though, something more edgy about a \u201cFuck the FA\u201d banner, one more sign of the unhappiness at the game being moved. Yet Karl Marginson, the manager of FC United since their founding, offered a more balanced view. Before kick-off he said: \u201cOn the footballing side it does have pros and cons \u2013 most of the lads will have been working during the day but on the other hand it had given them an extra couple to prepare following Telford.\u201d The start of the second half meant those involved in the protest outside Broadhurst Park would enter, if they adhered to their plan. Before the game around 100 fans had voiced their disquiet at the FA, before refusing to enter, instead intending to listen to the opening half on the radio. Marginson made his own move, replacing Craig Lindfield, a left-sided attacker, with the striker Rory Patterson, and Greg Daniels with Rory Fallon, also a forward. There was almost an instant dividend when Sam Sheridan swept a diagonal pass left to right to find Patterson. The Northern Irishman took aim but then missed. Rai Simons made it 3-0 before Ollie Banks, a former FC player, sealed victory with two minutes left. There was a late consolation from Luke Ashworth but it is Dean Saunders\u2019 Chesterfield who play Walsall in the next round. United, though, are about the bigger picture. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a football club. It\u2019s more about the belief we can make a difference,\u201d said Marginson. \u201cWhat goes out on the pitch, that\u2019s a showcase. But the amount of people this club\u2019s affected, we see numerous instances where we are able to give people a vision they can believe in.\u201d Marginson\u2019s belief is that FC United will be going strong on their 20th anniversary. \u201cHopefully the rent won\u2019t cause any problems,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be looking [in the next 10 years] to hopefully strengthen our youth team and academy so we can start producing our own players. That\u2019s going to make us sustainable for the long term.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
