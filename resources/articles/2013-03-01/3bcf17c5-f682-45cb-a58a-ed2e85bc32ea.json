If they had the choice they, too, would have beat a quick and quiet retreat back across the border. There, at least, the Welsh celebrations would have been out of sight, even if the hymns and arias resounding across the country were still in earshot. They will echo on through the weeks, months, and years, ahead. This was a win that will be remembered as long as this tournament is still being played. Whatever words Chris Robshaw had for his team as he gathered them tight around him in a huddle after the whistle, they would have been drowned out by the cries of \"Ea-sy, ea-sy, ea-sy\" that rolled down from the stands. That's the kind of insult that lasts long after the bruises have healed. This generation of England players will carry the scars from this game through the rest of their careers, just as those who came before them did after they blew successive shots at the grand slam in 1999, 2000, and 2001, and, like them, Robshaw's men will be hoping that the skin grows back thicker in the future because of the damage done now. \"The important thing is,\" Robshaw said, \"as hard as it is now, is that we learn from this. It would be easy to brush it under the carpet and go our separate for the next two months, when we all go back to club rugby. But we need to make sure this hurt makes us a better side.\" Lawrence Dallaglio told his own team something similar when England last lost a grand slam to the Welsh, at Wembley in 1999. \"Bottle this feeling.\" The team, Stuart Lancaster said, \"had never found a foothold\". They spent much of the match scrambling, in defence and attack. In the first 50 minutes they made double the number of tackles Wales did, but missed six times as many as their opponents. They won only a single scrum, gave up 18 turnovers, and conceded 12 penalties. Not just beaten by a better side, then, but humiliated by them. Robshaw trotted out the old cliche: \"You don't become a bad team in one performance, and you don't become a great team in one performance. It is about consistency.\" Quite right too. But he was being little less honest when he added: \"We showed it in four games of this tournament, but we didn't today.\" England's play has been far patchier than that assessment suggests. Since they scored four tries against Scotland they have managed only one more in four games. They got away with it, thanks in part to a couple of lucky breaks that were balanced out by what happened in Cardiff, when everything seemed to go against them. Against Ireland the game changed when Jonny Sexton went off injured after 30 minutes, and against France Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 shot himself in the foot with a series of baffling, blundering substitutions. Which isn't to say that England are a bad team. Just a young one. There were flashes of fine play in the thick of the carnage: Mike Brown's tap tackle on George North, Robshaw's superb work all around the field, and Owen Farrell's audacious dummy and deft grubber-kick to set up a chance for Brown. But those moments were outnumbered by the ones in which England betrayed their inexperience as an international side. The moment when Manu Tuilagi spilled a pass with the Wales line open in front of him set the tone. Farrell missed two kicks. Alex Goode spilled a couple of catches. Error was added to error. Less forgivably, Chris Ashton played as poorly as he has all tournament. Some players will get stronger for going through an experience like this. Others may slip out of the side on to the wayside. Lancaster has shown a lot of loyalty to Ashton but the sight of him trailing off yet another runner like a scarf in a stiff breeze has become too familiar to bear much more of. Tactically, Lancaster felt his team had made the mistake of chasing the game in the final quarter, and so \"made a bad job worse\". Too often they slipped without thinking into a plan that would have been better suited to a late-night shift in a sausage factory: keep shoving meat into the grinder and never mind what's coming out the other end. When the roaring dies down in their ears, the English players will reflect on a match that was played under more pressure than anything they had experienced before. English teams in Wales aren't just saddled with having to defend their own tryline but the bedroom tax, cuts in subsidies to the Welsh Book Council, the slashing of the S4C budget, the price hikes on the Severn Bridge, the failure of Glamorgan CCC to find a another native fast bowler to replace James Harris and, quite possibly, the drop in demand for mutton among London restaurateurs. The stadium itself was, as Andy Farrell said, \"a cauldron\", bubbling over with heat, smoke, and noise. Outside there was no welcome for those wearing white shirts on the scarlet streets, where a red river of people ran round islands of scarf salesmen and scalpers seeking tickets to sell. \"These are the types of occasions where you gain experience for knock- out matches in the big tournaments,\" Robshaw said. \"I don't think that out of a World Cup games can come any bigger than this one.\" That's true. And this time, England were found wanting. \"The long term goal is the 2015 World Cup,\" Robshaw continued. \"But it is hard to see that now, an hour after the final whistle in a game where we got smashed by 30 points or whatever it was.\" If there was a positive to be taken, it was this: England now know that they \"still have a fair way to go\" as a side. As the captain says: \"It's in the worst defeats that you learn the most.\" There will be no shortage of lessons from this mess."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
