At the end of this season, Atl\u00e9tico are leaving their home down by the Manzanares; Real will not be back to the arena that they left victorious for the 30th time. This, like the man who secured it, will be remembered on their side of town. Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s hat-trick here took him beyond Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano: no player has ever scored as many Madrid derby goals. It also took Real, unbeaten in 29 games, nine points clear of Atl\u00e9tico in the league, four above Barcelona. There was symbolism here, too, the sense that something shifted. Zinedine Zidane described his team as \u201cenormous\u201d. \u201cNot many sides will win here,\u201d he said. That has included his side of late: Real had defeated Atl\u00e9tico twice in three years in the Champions League final, but Diego Simeone had resuscitated a derby that had died, and Atl\u00e9tico had been beaten only once in 11. Defeat was possible, but defeat like this was unexpected. Real Madrid were without Casemiro, Pepe and Toni Kroos, and there was no starting place for Sergio Ramos or Karim Benzema, returning from injury. If that seemed problematic, it may have proven beneficial. Zidane has always said that the \u2013 BBC \u2013 a front three of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano \u2013 is non-negotiable; without them, he did not only change personnel, he changed positions too. Madrid began with something close to a 4-4-2, with Gareth Bale to the left of midfield and Lucas V\u00e1zquez to the right. Up front was Ronaldo and, dropping off him, Isco. One of Madrid\u2019s recurring problems against Atl\u00e9tico has been that they almost invariably found themselves outnumbered in midfield, red and white shirts flooding the area beyond their front three and to either side of the middle three. Here, it was different. \u201cThe middle is fundamental,\u201d Zidane admitted. Madrid had four-plus-one in there, the space denied when Atl\u00e9tico looked to run. On either side, Bale and Lucas worked tirelessly though only occasionally broke free \u2013 it was the latter who was brought down in the move that lead to the opener and the former who provided the third goal. In this formation, Ronaldo\u2019s position was the No9 role he has increasingly adopted over the last two years and he responded his way: with a hat-trick. Isco, meanwhile, found himself in a role that rarely exists in this side and one in which, given freedom and responsibility, suits him best. \u201cHis best position,\u201d in his manager\u2019s words. For 45 minutes he was superb: passing, dribbling, turning, working, his touch smooth. Bandy-legged, wide-hipped, so often in possession , he stood out. From the middle, he combined with Luka Modric and Mateo Kovacic and carried towards Ronaldo. Twice in the opening quarter of an hour, Isco lifted the ball cleverly, almost gently, over the head of opponents. Modric and Kovacic had a man to seek in short; Madrid had a man waiting to receive when they went long, the knock downs often his. Marcelo cleared a hard, swinging Yannick Carrasco free-kick at the far post, then Nacho hooked away from Fernando Torres and soon after Stefan Savic volleyed wide from Koke\u2019s angled pass. All that happened in the opening 10 minutes, but then it did not happen again. Atl\u00e9tico looked unsure in the middle, exactly where they are usually so strong. Madrid began to exercise a degree of control. It was not total but it was there, ushered in by Ronaldo\u2019s header from Marcelo\u2019s ball. The Portuguese thought that Jan Oblak had saved it over the line. Ronaldo then failed to connect from the edge of the area and Oblak saved Modric\u2019s shot. When Lucas was brought down 28 metres from goal, there was another chance. Ronaldo stepped back, that long, paced-out run-up and struck the free-kick straight at the wall, which opened. The ball went between Gabi and Savic, hitting the central defender on the hip, changing course and going in. He had gone 33 shots without beating Oblak \u2013 not including that penalty in Milan \u2013 and soon he had a 35th, turning cleverly inside Godin but not getting sufficient power with his right foot. Atl\u00e9tico flew out at the start of the second half. Inside the opening five minutes, Carrasco curled over, Antoine Griezmann flashed one across the face of goal, and then he shot from distance. At the other end, Bale headed over. A double change followed: K\u00e9vin Gameiro and Angel Correa appeared to make good the change, but the rebellion was quashed swiftly. Isco hit the post and then, with 20 minutes left and the game alive, an Atl\u00e9tico goal kick ended it. Rapha\u00ebl Varane leapt to head it, the ball travelling 30 yards, over the top and back into Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s area. Ronaldo and Savic ran after it, grappling for position. The defender fell, legs up, and brought Ronaldo down. Accidental, perhaps, but a penalty. Ronaldo against Oblak from 12 yards again, just like the very last kick in Milan; just like Milan, Ronaldo scored. The game was over, Atl\u00e9tico crushed, Simeone later saying his team had seen its \u201chope cut\u201d, but that was not the last of it. Bale broke on the left, released by Isco, and delivered the perfect pass for Ronaldo to score the very last derby goal at the Calder\u00f3n."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
