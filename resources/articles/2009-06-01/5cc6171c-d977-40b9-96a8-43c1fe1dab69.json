Christine Gilbert, the chief inspector of schools, sets out a wide-ranging overhaul of inspections that will see annual surveys of parents, schools rated on their pupils' \"wellbeing\", and some snap inspections of low-performing schools. Ofsted is abandoning \"lighter touch\" inspections, introduced four years ago, in favour of tougher systems in which inspectors will spend twice as much time in the classroom scrutinising lessons. Schools that get lower exam results cannot be rated good, even if they are in tough areas and are making steady improvements. \"My impression is that it will be harder for a school to be rated good or outstanding,\" Gilbert said. She said she hoped the changes, to be introduced in September, would not trigger an increase in the number of schools being poorly rated in inspections, but that schools would raise their game and get better results. The best schools \u2013 those already rated good or outstanding \u2013 will be allowed to go up to five years without inspections, as long as their results do not drop and annual surveys show that parents are happy. Ofsted is looking at ways to survey parents independently of schools, such as online questionnaires. During inspections, schools will be judged on pupils' wellbeing and awareness of health issues, test and exam results, and the progress children make. Teachers and pupils will also be surveyed. Ofsted has dropped proposals for unannounced inspections across the board, but will instead be reducing the amount of notice schools get from a maximum of five days to two. Inspections of schools in special measures and about 40% of schools rated \"satisfactory\" will be unannounced. Teachers immediately accused Gilbert of unfairly making inspections harder. John Dunford, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"I am extremely concerned that Ofsted is again raising the bar and making it harder to get good and outstanding grades. \"It's like telling athletes running a four-minute mile that they need to do a mile and a quarter in the same time. The increased emphasis on raw results will make it more difficult for schools in challenging circumstances. School leaders will be more reluctant to take on headship.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
