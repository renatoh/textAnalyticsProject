MPs inside the private gathering said there were surprise interventions from colleagues who had never before spoken out against Corbyn, including Lloyd Russell-Moyle and Marie Rimmer. The parliamentary Labour party (PLP) meeting came amid anger about how Corbyn\u2019s office had handled harassment complaints against two senior Labour figures, as well as an investigation into Labour antisemitism by the equalities watchdog. One MP leaving the committee room said it had been Corbyn\u2019s \u201cworst meeting in his time as leader\u201d \u2013 including those that led to the vote of no confidence in him. \u201cHe did not even seem to acknowledge there were difficulties, from Brexit, to sexual harassment, to antisemitism.\u201d Speaking to MPs for the first time since the European election results, where Labour was beaten into third place by the Liberal Democrats, Corbyn reiterated that the party would back a referendum on any deal passed by parliament and said the issue would be discussed by the shadow cabinet on Tuesday, but the assurances did little to stem the criticism. Rimmer, whose speech inspired whoops and cheers in the room, told Corbyn: \u201cPeople who worked with you for years are turning away from us.\u201d In what colleagues described as an emotionally charged speech, Rimmer said that it \u201cwasn\u2019t easy for me to vote Labour\u201d in the EU elections, and \u201cthe leadership is not there\u201d on the party\u2019s Brexit policy. \u201cShe eviscerated him,\u201d one Labour MP said. \u201cNo one was expecting her to speak out like that.\u201d Another called it \u201cone of the best speeches I have ever heard in here \u2013 it clearly came from the heart\u201d. Russell-Moyle, a key Corbyn loyalist, intervened to insist that MPs should be allowed to criticise senior staff by name if they were influential in policymaking, saying there was \u201ca difference between frontline workers and the management\u201d. His comments were a direct counter to Corbyn, who had earlier called for MPs not to publicly attack staff or the shadow cabinet. That comment from Corbyn led several MPs to shout, \u201cShe\u2019s sitting next to you\u201d and point to shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who was demoted from her usual slot standing in for Corbyn at PMQs after she criticised the party\u2019s Brexit policy on election night. In his speech before the interventions, the Labour leader said the party must unite to take on the \u201cdangerously damaging policies\u201d of the Tory leadership candidates, including tax cuts that will benefit the richest, attacks on abortion rights, and a \u201crace-to-the-bottom no-deal Brexit\u201d. He said Labour was committed to working cross-party to stop no deal. \u201cTo break the Brexit deadlock, we need to go back to the people. Let the people decide the country\u2019s future, either in a general election or through a public vote on any deal agreed by parliament,\u201d he said. One Corbyn ally said they had been taken aback by the tone of the criticism. A Labour source called the meeting \u201crobust\u201d, but said it had not been worse than previous meetings. \u201cClearly, there are very strong feelings about Brexit and how it should be handled, both in the Labour party and the country \u2013 and among Labour MPs. That\u2019s no secret at all,\u201d the source said. \u201cWe are in a period of heightened polarisation on Brexit, and that is why Jeremy is trying to find a way that reflects our conference policy and that brings the country together. We are listening to the views of members and our MPs \u2026 The PLP is very passionate, and that\u2019s what we would expect.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s comments about ending the criticism of staff were taken to refer to Karie Murphy, his chief of staff, who was criticised in leaked emails for her apparent handling of two harassment complaints, one against senior Labour aide David Prescott and another against Pete Willsman, a member of Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee who has since been suspended over allegations of antisemitism. Jess Phillips, the chair of the Women\u2019s PLP, told the meeting the revelations were shameful. \u201cIf you abuse women in the Labour party and they\u2019re a friend of yours, they get away with it,\u201d she said, according to MPs in the room. Corbyn robustly denied that was the case, saying she should not have suggested that. MPs also expressed alarm that Corbyn\u2019s opening speech failed to mention the investigation into antisemitism in the party that has been launched by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The party\u2019s handling of antisemitism cases was compared with the automatic expulsion of the former spin doctor Alastair Campbell for admitting he had voted Lib Dem in the European elections. Labour MP Wes Streeting suggested this was a double standard. Labour\u2019s new Peterborough MP, Lisa Forbes, apologised to MPs at the meeting for liking Facebook posts that referred to \u201cZionist slavemasters\u201d. But MPs including Margaret Hodge said Forbes had failed to address another aspect of the complaints, her signing of a letter criticising the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s definition of antisemitism. Forbes said she had written to Jewish community groups and hoped to meet the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Labour Movement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
