I mean, it's really hip. The decor is reminiscent of a hipster's paradise with cool colour blocking in the entrance way and a simple open bar atmosphere. It's a great place to just chill. The drinks are superb. They make their own colas which are divine and the happy hour is great. Speciality drinks can cost up to $10 but there is also something for those looking to spend less \u2013 a \"happy meal\" for $5, consisting of a burger, beer and fries. Also cool to note are the shots named after Beat writers. Bukowski, Thompson, Burroughs and more are all honoured with a twist to their signature cocktail choices served up for $5 a pop. They always have good tunes playing and awesome DJs come out to spin weekly. The last time I was here the security guard gave me a ride home. Now that's swanky. \u2022 407 Gallatin Road, +1 615 650 7344, bar308.com. Open daily 5pm-3am Red Door Saloon You've heard of skeletons in the closet, but Red Door Saloon has a skeleton in the basement. It's tricky talking your friends into laying down on a bar-room floor and peeking into a tiny hole in the wood but once they do, they will see a full skeleton. Who cares as long as the drinks are strong and the music is loud? There is a Red Door in both East and West Nashville, with both basements displaying the remains of a past life. And if you've ever envisioned a bar made out of money, then Red Door would be it. The entire bar top is made out of pennies. They serve up the finest brats in town, Chicago style, and the jukebox is always on loud. Did I mention it's a biker bar? Ask for Billy Wayne. \u2022 1816 Division Street, +1 615 320 6525, thereddoorsaloon.com. Open daily 11am-2.30am The Patterson House Not sure this is happening in other cities, but folk in Nashville sometimes like to dress like they live in the 1930s. I think this started with the bartenders at Patterson House. Known as the first \"speakeasy\" (wasn't that the 30s?) in Nashville \u2013 well, speakeasy \"themed\" \u2013 Patterson House has helped cultivate the true art of mixing a good drink in the city. Just as with speakeasies in the past, this place is not outspoken and you won't see a sign for it until you reach the door. They make their own sodas here and I'm convinced Edward Scissorhands shaves their ice cubes for them \u2013 they're incredible and there's a fine art to making them. They have about 20 different bitters and syrups they make in-house. One drink which never changes is the bacon-infused Old Fashioned. The scene is old English and dark\u2026 perfect for a romantic cocktail. \u2022 1711 Division Street, +1 615 636 7724, thepattersonnashville.com. Open daily 5pm-3am Fran's East Side Fran's East Side is one of the seediest bars in Nashville. Fran's was there before the cool people moved to East Nashville. Fran's was probably here before the dinosaurs. And if you talk to the two men running karaoke you will know why. Veterans of the country music scene in Nashville, these two are decked out in top country gear and they sing the old hits. Make sure to bring cash because that's all they take. Also bring your beer appetite because that's all they have. The buckets of beer come on ice and are dirt cheap. Ask for Trina. And don't be scared. These are the friendliest people you'll ever meet. \u2022 2109 Greenwood Avenue, +1 615 226 9697, facebook.com/pages/Frans-East-Side. Open daily till 1am Robert's Western World Roberts Western World is a world class honky tonk. There are many great bars on Broadway in downtown Nashville, but this is the one locals go to. The music is always great and the burgers are amazing. They even cater to those on their uppers, serving up the \"recession special\": a bologna sandwich, Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, and a moon pie for $5. There's music every night, and we're talking the finest music in town. Roberts usually has two bars on weekends, which makes getting a drink relatively easy even on a busy night. The wall of cowboy boots is a favourite of many. Ask for Riley and she will make you a stiff one. \u2022 416 Broadway, +1 615 244 9552, robertswesternworld.com. Check listings/website for venue/gig hours The Gold Rush A friend recently told me he'd spent eight hours at the Gold Rush one Sunday. With bartender Patrick introducing patrons to each other, people sit and visit for hours. It's got an old school feel but it's not considered a dive bar. Dive bars don't serve catfish poblano mac and cheese. Buster is the kitchen king here and the Gold Rush is known for some of the best bar food in town \u2013 that's why it's where the locals go. Not only is the food outstanding but they have all the drinks. They serve up the local brews as well as all the main liquor contenders. You can find many Nashville natives belly up at the bar on a Sunday with hot cakes and bloody marys for hours. I recommend cabbing it home. \u2022 2205 Elliston Place, +1 615 321 1160, goldrushnashville.com. Open daily 11am-3am The 5 Spot The 5 spot isn't just famous from the hit ABC TV show Nashville. It's also famous because it's the only live music venue in East Nashville. Along with great tunes, they serve up loads of different beers and all the main liquors. It's known as the east side neighbourhood bar and although they make improvements to their building, they aren't putting on any airs. It's decorated like your high school band's practice space and if you're cool that means you'll feel right at home. Important to note is the insanely cool Monday night dance party. Everyone in town knows about it. DJ Jacob Jones and others spin the old hits (Otis Redding, Curtis Mayfield, Al Green) and everyone cuts a rug. Make sure you dress to sweat because you'll be on the floor all night. Go before 10 and get in free. After that it's three bucks but it's the best workout in town. \u2022 1006 Forrest Avenue, +1 615 650 9333, the5spotlive.com. Open daily 8pm-3am The Flying Saucer Located behind the Union Station Hotel, The Flying Saucer is a very large, open bar with plates (saucers) on every wall. These plates represent a \"badge of honour\" by patrons who have tried every beer they have, and trust me, there's a lot of beer in this draught emporium: 83 beers on tap and over 120 bottles and counting. They issue a card where customers can register all the drinks they've had. Once they reach their goal a plate with their name and date is placed on the wall forever. And some people have more than one plate! The bar's decor is much like the Union Station Hotel close by \u2013 old and fancy, sans the plates on the wall. In the 1900s, this was a train station and the bar area is right where they would pull in. They even have an old freight tram near the parking area. \u2022 111 10th Avenue South, +1 615 259 3039, beerknurd.com. Open Mon, Fri-Sat 11am-2am, Tues-Thurs 11am-1am, Sun noon-midnight The Greenhouse Bar The Greenhouse Bar in Green Hills (a few miles south of downtown Nashville) is, quite literally, a greenhouse. This is one of the most interesting bars in Nashville. If you've never had the chance to get drunk in a greenhouse well, here is your opportunity. With affordable drink prices and great food, this bar is frequented by the after-work crowd as well as the Saturday night party animals. The Food Company next door caters the food and with items like bacon popcorn and bacon jalapeno deviled eggs, it's sure to draw a hungry crowd. There isn't really a drink menu here, per se, but they have everything from bourbon and beer to their very own fruity \"tipsy tea\" that they make in-house. \u2022 2211 Bandywood Drive, +1 615 385 4311, thefoodcompanynashville.com. Open daily 4pm-3am The Villager Tavern The Villager in Hillsboro Village is best known for the infamous dog bowl. But we'll get to that later. The best part about this bar is that it's old school. It's old school in a new age neighbourhood \u2013which I guess means it's a dive bar, and a great one at that. \"The Village\", as it's coined, is a hip college area near Vanderbilt University. No one is really sure how long The Villager Tavern has been there. The photos which cover the walls, and serve as the bar's main decor, suggest it's been entertaining patrons for quite some time. I think I spotted Abraham Lincoln in a photo but I'm not sure. This is a beer and wine only bar and they don't serve food, but hungry drinkers can walk right out and have several restaurant options. There's a large open dart room out back. And if it's your birthday, you get a free dog bowl of beer to drink out of. Cheers! \u2022 1719 21st Avenue, +1 615 298 3020, no website. Open Mon-Wed 3pm-2.30am, Thurs-Sun 2pm-2.30am Lindsay Scott is a writer and photographer from East Nashville \u2022 For more information on holidays in the USA, visit DiscoverAmerica.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
