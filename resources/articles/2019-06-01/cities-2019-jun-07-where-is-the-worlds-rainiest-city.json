Without soil to soak up excess water, drains can overflow and roads turn into streams. Daily life is brought to a standstill. Some cities, of course, have more practice than others \u2013 but identifying the world\u2019s rainiest city is not straightforward. A map of World Bank data shows that the rainiest countries in the world are clearly centred around the equator \u2013 the top of South America, in central and west Africa, and among the islands of south-east Asia \u2013 but the World Bank doesn\u2019t specify city-level data. It is, though, possible to look up locations in those areas individually to find online data collected from local weather stations. The highest recorded rainfalls are in remote places where few people live. Looking at Asia first, two small towns in north-east India \u2013 Mawsynram and nearby Cherrapunji \u2013 vie for the title of \u201cwettest place on Earth\u201d. The average annual rainfall in Mawsynram, which is recognised as the world\u2019s wettest by the Guinness Book of Records, is 11,871mm \u2013 more than 10 times the Indian national average of 1,083mm. If we limit our focus to large cities, the Indian megacity of Mumbai (2,386mm average annual rainfall) and the city state of Singapore (2,378mm) could feasibly lay claim to the top spot. The capital of the Philippines, Manila, receives 2,047mm annually and the Indonesian capital of Jakarta gets 1,855mm. In Africa, annual precipitation in Liberia\u2019s capital, Monrovia, can exceed 5,000mm, according to the Liberian Hydrological Services. It is known as the \u201cwettest capital city\u201d by residents and its dampness is no doubt due to its location on a peninsula jutting into the Atlantic Ocean. The port city, home to just over a million people, gets an average of 996mm in July alone. The rainy season can cause havoc, as potholes fill with water and roads turn to rivers. Hilo, Hawaii\u2019s largest city, is often cited as the rainiest city in the US, with 3,459mm a year. The mountains of the state\u2019s Big Island neatly divide its rainy north from its dry south-west, with one side exposed to wet weather and the other protected. Hilo is in the north-east. In South America, Colombia has a few claims to rainiest city. The remote city of Quibd\u00f3 is sometimes cited as the rainiest in the world, with average rainfall of 7,328mm a year, according to one estimate from local weather station data. Home to 125,000 people, the city is a former slave-trading hub that sits on the banks of the Atrato River and is surrounded by dense tropical rainforest. Despite being just 40 miles from the Pacific Ocean, Quibd\u00f3 can only be reached from the coast by air. It is not unusual in Quibd\u00f3 for rain to fall every day in some months, yet it has no reliable source of drinking water. \u201cIn Quibd\u00f3 people live from rainwater,\u201d says the academic Edwar Calder\u00f3n, who spent three years studying in the city. \u201cAbout 85% of the population drink water collected in containers on their rooftops. People with money can afford to buy bottles of water, but most of the population is poor so they collect and then boil the rainwater. It is an essential part of life.\u201d But while vital for survival, rainfall paralyses the city. \u201cIt will rain very heavily for four or five hours at a time,\u201d Calder\u00f3n says. \u201cPeople get stuck under shelter where they are for the whole of that time.\u201d Two smaller places in Colombia \u2013 L\u00f3pez de Micay and Llor\u00f3 \u2013 have also competed for the title of rainiest inhabited place on Earth. L\u00f3pez de Micay had an estimated average annual rainfall between 1960 and 2012 of 12,892.4 mm \u2013 which would rank it above even Mawsynram in India \u2013 but the statistics provided by the Colombian meteorological service have been disputed due to gaps in the record. Similarly, Llor\u00f3 recorded an average annual rainfall rate of 12,717mm between 1952 and 1989. With populations of 20,000 and 11,000 respectively, neither match Quibd\u00f3 for city status. In places such as Britain and the northern US, cities typically suffer from high numbers of drizzly, overcast days rather than heavy bursts of rain. For the likes of Manchester and Seattle, a reputation for rain is a well-known part of their charm, even when the data does not always back that reputation up. A Met Office analysis from 2014 found that Cardiff was in fact the UK\u2019s rainiest city with an average 1,152mm of rain every year, followed closely by Glasgow. Manchester, with 867mm, only came eighth. Similarly, Seattle is not the rainiest mainland American city, says Brian Brettschneider, a climate scientist based in Alaska who creates maps for his blog based on climate data in the US. \u201cWhen I made the map about the rainiest places in the US, I found that Seattle averages 950mm of precipitation annually, and that is very close to the average value for the entire US,\u201d he says. \u201cAround 45% of the US is wetter than Seattle, counting both rain and melted snow. \u201cWhen I published the map on Twitter, a lot of people in Seattle were very upset about it. They take a lot of pride in it being rainy. But somewhere south, like Texas, gets more. It\u2019s just that it falls in about a third of the days that Seattle has rain \u2013 whereas there it\u2019s overcast and frequently drizzly.\u201d To counter the disappointing finding about Seattle, Brettschneider performed a new analysis of places that have what he terms the \u201cdreariest weather\u201d, a measure that combines precipitation (including snow), wet days and cloud cover. East coast and Pacific north-west cities came top on the dreary scale. \u201cSeattle came very high on that list,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is one of the dreariest cities in the US.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
