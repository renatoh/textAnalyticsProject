Speaking on his podcast, the War Room, which was distributed in video form on a number of social media outlets, the far-right provocateur appeared to endorse violence against Wray and the US\u2019s most senior infectious diseases expert. \u201cSecond term kicks off with firing Wray, firing Fauci \u2026 no I actually want to go a step farther but the president is a kind-hearted man and a good man,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cI\u2019d actually like to go back to the old times of Tudor England. I\u2019d put their heads on pikes, right, I\u2019d put them at the two corners of the White House as a warning to federal bureaucrats, you either get with the programme or you\u2019re gone.\u201d Twitter banned Bannon\u2019s War Room account permanently, saying it had suspended the podcast account for violating its policy on the glorification of violence. The same video was on Facebook for about 10 hours before it was also removed. Later on Friday, William Burck, an attorney for Bannon in a fraud case in New York City, told a federal judge he was withdrawing. Bannon is accused of misappropriating money from a group which raised $2m from thousands of donors to build a wall on the border with Mexico, and has pleaded not guilty. Burck did not give a reason for his withdrawal. There has been mounting concern over the risk of violence following this week\u2019s US elections, amid highly inflammatory rhetoric from Trump and his allies, who have falsely said Democrats are trying to \u201csteal the election\u201d. Philadelphia police arrested two men allegedly involved in a plot to attack the Pennsylvania Convention Center on Thursday night. Police were tipped off, possibly from a concerned family member of one of the men, who had driven 300 miles from Virginia. The moves against Bannon came hours after Facebook banned \u201cStop the Steal\u201d, a group involved in organising protests this weekend throughout the US against the presidential vote count. One post, shared by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, declared: \u201cNeither side is going to concede. Time to clean the guns, time to hit the streets.\u201d The increasingly heated language around the election has also included interventions from more mainstream figures, including the former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich, who appeared to call for election workers in Pennsylvania to be arrested. Speaking to Sean Hannity on Fox News, Gingrich amplified Trump\u2019s false complaints of election rigging and mused about what he believed was the solution. \u201cMy hope is that President Trump will lead the millions of Americans who understand exactly what\u2019s going on,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cThe Philadelphia machine is corrupt. The Atlanta machine is corrupt. The machine in Detroit is corrupt. And they are trying to steal the presidency. And we should not allow them to do that.\u201d \u201cFirst of all, under federal law, we should lock up the people who are breaking the law,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou stop somebody from being an observer, you just broke federal law. Do you hide and put up papers so nobody can see what you\u2019re doing? You just broke federal law. You bring in ballots that aren\u2019t real? You just broke federal law.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
