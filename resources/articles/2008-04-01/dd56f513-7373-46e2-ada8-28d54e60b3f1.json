Murphy chose him in preference to Vodka Bleu, who will be ridden by Paul Moloney. Ladbrokes, who reported money for Comply Or Die, also trimmed Turko to 25-1 from 33-1 in response to the booking of Richard Johnson for the Paul Nicholls-trained six-year-old. Nicholls had said on Monday that his charge would not run if a suitably senior rider could not be found. Johnson's booking is therefore bad news for connections of Philson Run, who learned yesterday that their horse still needs one non-runner from those above him in the weights in order to make the safety limit of 40 runners for the race, as his latest handicap rating is lower than that of Black Apalachi, set to carry the same weight of 10st 8lb. \"It's terribly disappointing, but it looks as though everything's going to run,\" said Philson Run's trainer Nick Williams. \"We've got into lots of big races as the last one so it's the law of averages that we should miss out this time, though he was second reserve two years ago and didn't get in then.\" Philson Run, fourth in last year's National at 100-1, will be rerouted to the Scottish National if unable to run. Williams' best hope of a withdrawal may be Opera Mundi, for whom the going may not be soft enough. Barry Simpson, spokesman for owner Sir Robert Ogden, said: \"I expect to declare him [at the final entry stage] on Thursday and see how the course rides that afternoon. We will make a decision on Friday, in time for a reserve to take his place if he doesn't run.\" Ron Cox's tip of the day Rebellious Spirit 4.10 Nottingham Sean Curran has done remarkably well with Rebellious Spirit who notched up his eighth win in total, and his first win on turf, when posting an easy victory at Warwick last time out. He has to shoulder a 6lb penalty for that success but as that impost means he runs off a handicap mark he has already won off on the all-wether there is every reason to believe he can win again today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
