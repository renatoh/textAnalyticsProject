John Madejski, the club's chairman and Conservative Party benefactor, played a significant part in the undermining of IDS, and on Saturday evening Steve Coppell, if perhaps only temporarily in this case, put the skids under WBA. Having watched their main rivals clatter into an untidy heap, West Brom, the First Division leaders, kicked off late in front of the television cameras with the chance to establish themselves on even higher ground. However, they possessed neither the wit nor gumption to overcome a five-man midfield and a vertically challenged Reading defence, to the obvious frustration of their manager Gary Megson. There is much to admire about The Hawthorns. Wisely they refused to sell their birthright in a vain attempt to stay in the Premiership and they have emerged all the stronger. This feels like a well-run club that is going places and it is important for them not to stall. But this was a disconcertingly na\u00efve performance. Coppell has barely had time to bed in since Alan Pardew's departure, although there has been no sudden or disruptive change of style to date. The ball is played to feet with composure and style, albeit with little in the way of attacking rhythm on this occasion. Coppell has been hit with key injuries in central defence and Megson selected both Rob Hulse and Daniele Dichio in an attempt to exploit any frailties. But the big men were stymied in the first half, notably by Ricky Newman, who has played at full-back, midfield and now at centre-half. \"I call him my Paul Madeley but he hasn't a clue what I'm talking about,\" said Coppell. Old Leeds men could put him in the picture. Megson switched his side around after half-time, introducing Lee Hughes and Neil Clement, and for 10 minutes or so the momentum mounted. Unfortunately for West Brom both the best chances fell to Bernt Haas who at the end lingered on the pitch, perhaps fearing the reception he would receive in the changing room. Not that the fault was his alone. The arrival of Clement, and the increasingly forceful running of Jason Koumas, gave Hughes and Hulse greater support but it was never sustained. \"To be successful we must get more people forward on a regular basis,\" said Megson. There is no outstanding side in the division so, as Megson suggested, \"it's going to be a bit of a grind\". West Brom appear well equipped, for there is no doubting their commitment or fitness. \"They are the best team in the division,\" said Coppell. \"If you finish above them then you'll get promoted.\" Coppell talked of mental strength, the importance of not being discouraged by \"strange defeats\" and the belief that points garnered at this \"dark side of the year\" would bear fruit in the spring. They were the words of a man travelling in hope rather than expectation whereas Megson exuded belief and anticipation of a return to the promised land.
