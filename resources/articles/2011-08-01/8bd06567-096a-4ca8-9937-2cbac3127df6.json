Between Healey and Dawn Porter, they've covered every aspect of the journey, from tufty teen to swaggering adult. So hereforth are the Seven Life Lessons, as handed down to us on big television tablets made of thoughts \u2026 1 - Dating In Cherry Goes Dating the aforementioned Cherry \u2013 Sarah Beeny's less judgemental kid sister \u2013 interviewed a number of women about their love lives, including a girl who'd been on 300 dates with no success. Lesson You should \"be yourself\" when you meet men and \"be less rigid\" in your requirements. So invite for dinner any gankin' tramp who can sit upright and turn up to dates in your pyjamas with no makeup on and scratch your bum crack at will. 2 - Spontaneous public nudity In the now infamous Dawn \u2026 series on BBC3, Dawn Porter, the thinking man's blow-up doll, embarked on a series of deeply personal adventures into her fluff-bound psyche. Perhaps the very worst was Dawn Goes Naked, in which she tackled feminism by riding around on a bus with her top off. Lesson The true meaning of feminism is tits out for yourself, not the lads. Right, girls? (Also, stripping is empowering, but we'll save that for another show.) 3 - Pregnancy Dawn and Cherry both made shows about having a baby, but only one of them bothered to get pregnant before filming began. Full credit to Cherry for her commitment. Lesson From Cherry we learned that impending motherhood is bewildering, exciting, surreal and wonderful. From Dawn? That those strap-on bellies they give to teenagers to promote contraception are, like, heavy and make you look fat, OMG! 4 - Parenthood Dawn left this one to Cherry, who is currently wrangling her own toddler and interviewed parents up and down the land to find out what's in store for her over the next 16-and-a-half years. Or 35-plus, if the kids find that years of academic study and professional apprenticeship still aren't enough to keep them in a job. Lesson The parents of teenagers are anxious, disillusioned husks of their former selves, desperate for the sweet relief of university/borstal/elopement. Basically, the darkness is coming. 5 - Sexual experimentation Heterosexual Dawn became bi-curious at exactly the moment a TV producer wanted her to make a show about kissing girls. Some things are just meant to be. So off she went to live with some nice lesbians, whom she teased with her possible Sapphism before finally recoiling in horror when it actually came to touching any of them. Unless she was pissed. Lesson We learned Dawn will try anything once as long as she doesn't actually have to try it. 6 - Alternative lifestyles Ever the uncompromising adventurer, Dawn travelled the world to check out ways to have sex in other countries. In Dawn Porter \u2026 for C4 (her series are all self-titled) she examined polygamy, free love, mail-order brides and being a geisha. Lesson We learned that there are as many different kinds of love as there are people, but most importantly, you must get flip-flops that fit if you're going on a huffy date with a Japanese businessman. 7 - Serious illness Cherry has yet to tackle this one, but Dawn had a go in her Sky1 show My Breasts Could Kill Me. Somewhere among the pieces to camera in which Dawn spent lingering, emotional moments admiring her breasts, there were interviews with people with breast cancer. Lesson We learned that people who actually have cancer fight against it stoically, while healthy TV presenters find it all too harrowing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
