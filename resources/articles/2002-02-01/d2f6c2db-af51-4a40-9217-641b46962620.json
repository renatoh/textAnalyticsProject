City's victory was capped by late goals from Eyal Berkovic and Shaun Goater after the foundations had been laid by Kevin Horlock and Darren Huckerby in the first period. Wolves' comfortable victory over lowly Walsall 24 hours earlier had established an eight-point advantage for the Black Country club and, despite the advantage of games in hand, had prompted Keegan to declare his side second favourites for the title. Keegan may have been echoing the sentiments of most managers when he asserted that it is points on the board that matter, but his comments also served to remind that the hyperbole surrounding City's cavalier season was at least slightly misplaced. Having apparently settled off-field disciplinary matters by issuing fines and final warnings to the goalkeeper Nicky Weaver, defender Richard Dunne and injured reserve Jeff Whitley after a nightclub skirmish in Liverpool, Keegan then confirmed that the matter closed by including Dunne and Weaver in his starting line-up. Those matters dealt with, City were ready to resume their task of attaining promotion and, typically, it was a task they set to with gusto and that despite an early scare, when Paul McLaren released the on-loan David Johnson only for Weaver to smother the danger. Prompted into a response, City quickly demonstrated the threat that had previously produced 43 goals in 18 home games. The effervescent Shaun Wright-Phillips played the ball into the feet of Goater, whose lay-off found Horlock in space 30 yards from goal. The Northern Ireland midfielder advanced two strides and then sent a delightful curling effort into the top corner of Kevin Pressman's net. Sixty seconds later and Huckerby almost doubled the lead with his first mazy run of the evening. The former Leeds and Newcastle forward did enough to gain a clear sight of goal and was unlucky to see his firm, low drive clip the far post. Undaunted, Wednesday responded in kind and would have drawn level had Shefki Kuqi's header been six inches to the left after the Finn had met Matthew Hamshaw's corner. With Johnson providing a constant threat, the Owls always looked a danger and Steve Howey will count himself fortunate that a clumsy challenge on the forward did not result in a penalty kick. Huckerby, though, was always likely to punish the tiniest of errors and he capitalised on the visiting defence's reluctance to block his progress and sent a low shot inside Pressman's near post to put City two up. The two-goal cushion re moved any lingering feelings of anxiety and City, or more specifically Berkovic, began to play with greater ambition and fluidity. Four minutes before the interval the Israeli playmaker worked his way to the byline and pulled the ball back for Goater, who astonishingly failed to add to his season's tally when he scuffed his shot wide. Moments later Berkovic again proved too elusive for the defence, this time teeing up Wright-Phillips who shot over under a heavy challenge that ended his involvement. The interval did nothing to dent City's momentum and within three minutes of the restart Danny Tiatto burst into the area, collected a weighted pass from the wing-back Niclas Jensen but fired in an angled drive that cannoned to safety off the far post. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
