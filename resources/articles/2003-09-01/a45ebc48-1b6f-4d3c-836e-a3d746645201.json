A home defeat at the hands of an Armenian side guaranteed the Irish the wooden spoon in Group Six. The current famine, that now extends to 1152 fruitless minutes of action, has surpassed the previous mark set by Liechtenstein and, depressingly, came on the the back of successive, positive displays against Spain and Ukraine that had raised hopes of an upturn in fortunes McIlroy's side continued to be afflicted by the combination of poor finishing and rank bad luck that had marred their previous 11 outings. Andy Smith, the Glentoran striker drafted in to provide David Healy with much needed support up front, was guilty of sending a free header wide from Damien Johnson's seventh minute cross before defender George McCartney twice spurned equally tempting chances. Northern Ireland's wastefulness was to prove expensive as Melikyan surged down the left flank before pulling back to forward Artavazd Karamyan who produced the kind of sharp, ruthless finish seemingly foreign to the home side to beat Maik Taylor for a 27th minute opener. Steve Jones looked Northern Ireland's most likely source of a goal although the Crewe striker twice failed to direct headers beyond the Armenian keeper Roman Berezovski, summing up a miserable night for the Irish. Northern Ireland (4-4-2): Taylor; Baird, A.Hughes, McCartney, McCann; Gillespie (Jones, 29), Griffin, Johnson, Doherty (Mulryne, 26); Healy, Smith. Armenia (3-5-2): Berezovski; Hovsepyan, Zeciu, Bilibio; Sargsyan, Petrosyan (Karamyan, 12), Khachatryan, Voskanyan, Melikyan; Karamyan, Mousesyan. Referee: A.Stredak (Slovakia)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
