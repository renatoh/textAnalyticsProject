The lobbyists have flocked to Manchester, the press, they love him. He can choose his associates. An enviable position of strength. Which is why so many continue to be surprised at his decision to stick with the homophobes and Holocaust dissemblers in his European parliament grouping. And closer to home, they wonder why his lieutenants in Doncaster are being allowed to line up alongside the English Democrat mayor Peter Davies, who has a Tory-dominated cabinet. The mayor's water carriers seem content with his early attempt to scupper the gay pride march, his attacks on diversity, his professed view that people could learn about family values from the Taliban, and his plea for council staff to join the English Democrat inspired union, Workers of England. Others not so. Last week 34 of the 35 councillors voted to distance themselves from his \"outrageous, inflammatory and insulting\" remarks. The one Tory who turned up backed the mayor. And it is a month now since the area's four MPs wrote to Cameron imploring him to break the link with the man who would be Alf Garnett. The result, silence. The first day for our new supreme court, a bright new dawn in which justice will be done, and seen to be done. But all of this conducted in the only major court in the land in which the architects, amid all the ballyhoo, have apparently forgotten to include a press box. A little thing perhaps, but these have been a symbol of open justice and a feature of British law since the time of the Levellers. The law lords saw the design. No one said anything. But then, perhaps, this is all of a piece with current thinking. The protagonists in cases to come before the court are mostly anonymous, identified only by coded letters. \"Your first term docket reads like alphabet soup,\" chided Geoffrey Robertson QC. And it's just as transparent. Staying with the law, and there is, the Sunday Times helpfully informs us, no suggestion that Jack Straw \"supports suicide bombing\". He is the justice secretary, so that's good to hear. But isn't it interesting that as Straw prepares for his face-off with BNP leader Nick Griffin, spooks should emerge from the woodwork to claim that he may be \"too close\" to undesirable Islamists. Too close, perhaps, \"to the Muslim Council of Britain\", \"a security figure\" tells the paper; recipient of support from a man who chairs a mosque that has in the past invited \"radical\" speakers. All denied; and there is no suggestion here that security figures might be happy to see the justice secretary squirm as Griffin suggests that he is in hock to Muslim extremists. But if that is what happens on Question Time, don't be surprised. At the National Theatre, watching a preview of David Hare's new play on the financial crash, The Power of Yes \u2013 which opens tonight \u2013 it occurs that much fun is to be had watching those who come under his spotlight sitting in the audience. John Scarlett, head of MI6, part author of Tony Blair's dodgy dossier on Iraq, was there for Hare's Stuff Happens. This time, we saw Ed Miliband, presumably checking up on what Hare (pictured) says about Gordon. Also Lionel Barber of the FT, whose paper features prominently. Adair Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, who is portrayed, was also there but by curtain down he had disappeared. Where to? \"He's gone backstage to see himself and tell the actor not to be so strident,\" a friend told us. Similar sightings welcomed. We promise to pass them on. And finally, a welcome to all our regular readers, even if that includes the rightwinger, Sun columnist and SunTalk presenter Jon \"Shock Jock\" Gaunt. \"I read the Guardian first of all the papers,\" he told an audience at Coventry University. \"As a former leftie, you want to know what they are thinking.\" We are thinking that you're wrong about almost everything, and so are your mates. Welcome in, all the same."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
