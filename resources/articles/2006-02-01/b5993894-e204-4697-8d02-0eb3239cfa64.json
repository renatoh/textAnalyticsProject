Some of Exit's elements - face paint as formal wear, for instance - are in keeping with the grand tradition of music festivals, but Exit, founded in 2000 as a student protest against President Milosevic, has a stronger rationale than most when it comes to the partying-with-a-conscience element. Last year, when Fatboy Slim headlined, with back-up from the White Stripes and Carl Cox, 150,000 revellers took in everything from extreme sports to extremely avant garde cinema. Beer is cheap (as are tickets), the backdrop - the medieval fortress of Novi Sad - is unique and the climate cheerfully Mediterranean. As Annie Mac of Radio 1 put it: 'The setting is spectacular, the line-up massive and the people completely inspiring. It's a truly special festival.' \u00b7 Exit Festival (www.exitfest.org)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
