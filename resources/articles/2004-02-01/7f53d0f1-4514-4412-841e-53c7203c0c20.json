It was ever thus. As the European parliamentary elections loom in June, and a new team of European commissioners is to be nominated this autumn, Brussels is already bristling with gossip about who will get the plum EU jobs. Top of the list, of course, is the nominee to replace the somewhat hapless Romano Prodi as president of the European commission. One golden rule applies. Whoever seriously wants the job should avoid a blessing from the British government like the plague. UK governments have a spectacularly poor record in selecting commission presidents. Jacques Santer was plonked into the post because John Major vetoed Jean Luc Dehaene, the then Belgian PM. Unless one subscribes to the conspiracy theory that her majesty's government actively wanted a dithering president who would preside over the humiliating mass resignation of the commission, it hardly counted as a masterstroke of political personnel management. Romano Prodi was the favoured candidate of Blair. \"A disappointment\" is about the best thing said of him today. So Antonio Vitorino, the pocket-sized Portuguese commissioner widely touted as the favoured candidate in London, better watch his back. Or at least go out of his way to distance himself from UK sponsorship. A well chosen speech advocating, say, full blown EU tax harmonisation should do the trick nicely. Gordon Brown and No 10 will be apoplectic, swiftly disown their protege, and Vitorino's chances of success will improve overnight. The Germans are said to favour Jean Claude Junker, the long standing PM of Luxembourg, understandably said to be bored running a country with the population of a medium-sized British town. The French, as ever the masters of these shadowy games, are still keeping their counsel. They are suspected of looking favourably on Guy Verhofstat, the Belgian PM and about the only non-French government leader who takes Jacques Chirac's idea of a \"pioneer group\" of EU member states seriously. Various characters from the smaller EU member states are popping their heads above the parapet. Paavo Lipponen, a singularly dour former Finnish PM, is plodding his way round Europe telling anyone who will listen (not many at the moment) that he is ready to take on the job. Costas Simitis, the grandfatherly outgoing leader of Greece, is claiming it's high time that Brussels is led by a Greek. And so the unseemly spectacle goes on. All the while, governments are supposed to respect the fiction that any decision should not formally be taken until the European elections are over and a new European parliament is sitting. The rule is supposed to be that a new president \"reflects\" the composition of the new parliament, in other words that he or she must be of the same party as the largest political group in the parliament. This, in turn, explains an even more unseemly drama which has recently unfolded in the corridors of the European parliament - the shabby agreement struck between Michael Howard and Hans Gert Pottering, the German MEP and head of the centre-right European People's party in the parliament. The facts are straightforward, if utterly perplexing. The Conservative party is a Eurosceptic party. Conservatives abhor European federalism. A sizeable number of Tory MEPs are anti-European zealots. Roger Helmer MEP, for instance, one of the leading Colonel Blimps of the Europhobic brigade, is on record as saying \"what I do not believe I can honourably do is to join a party or group which is committed to federalist objectives\". Yet, surprise surprise, that is precisely what the EPP is. Helmer has candidly admitted in correspondence with other MEPs that the EPP only tolerates his presence and that of his fellow UK Conservatives because \"it needs our numbers for the EP headcount game ... and is determined to suppress the Conservative vision of a Europe of Independent States\" (whatever that means). To be fair to Howard, he has pulled of a minor coup of sorts. He delivered a speech in Berlin recently which didn't retreat one iota from his traditional Euro hostility, but delivered it in sufficiently dulcet tones to dupe the press into reporting that he had significantly \"softened\" his stance on Europe. More importantly, he also duped Hans Gert Pottering into keeping the UK Conservatives in the EPP while guaranteeing them complete freedom to campaign against everything the EPP is purported to stand for. Herr Pottering has managed this remarkable contortion while simultaneously declaring that \"the [EPP] group will remain fully committed to European integration\". The mind boggles. It is difficult to discern who has abandoned their principles more shamelessly, the federalist Herr Pottering or the Eurosceptic Messrs Howard and Helmer. The explanation for these political gymnastics leads us straight back to the nomination of the next commission president. If Herr Pottering wants to claim that prize for his political group, he needs to muster the necessary numbers to remain the largest group in the European parliament. And that, he has calculated, is only possible with the addition of Michael Howard's Conservative MEPs. Convenience has once again triumphed over political principle. The Tories continue to revel in their familiar role as the awkward squad, bleating from the sidelines without the courage of their convictions to sever links with their continental partners. Herr Pottering controls sufficient numbers of MEPs to demand the trophy of the next commission president. And so the merry-go-round of EU politics spins again. My prediction? Somehow I suspect the real winner of this particular race has not fully emerged yet. In such a crowded field, the present front runners are more than likely to trip before the finishing line. Watch out for some of the more inconspicuous candidates still sheltering in the middle of the pack. Rodrigo Rato, for instance, the outstanding Spanish finance minister (and conveniently a member of the EPP political family). Or Pat Cox, the brilliant political communicator and president of the European parliament. Watch this space... \u00b7 Nick Clegg is the Liberal Democrat MEP for the East Midlands.
