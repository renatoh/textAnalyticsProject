In its 150th year, the gallery has grabbed attention by exhibiting the Beatles holding broken dolls and huge pieces of meat. Now a careful count of tree rings has shown that a portrait of Mary Queen of Scots, previously thought to be a later copy, dates back to her 16th century life. Critics bemoan the focus on subject over artistic object. But that is what marks this gallery out and helps it illuminate the past. Portraits do not just record, but define how and even who we remember. Holbein's famous depiction helped lodge an image of Henry VIII as larger than life in the nation's memory. Millais' encapsulation of a stern Gladstone hangs opposite his portrayal of a tricksy Disraeli - cementing their respective status as moral crusader and political playboy. By humanising distant figures, portraits keep people interested: the striking pictures of Thomas Cromwell and Thomas More help them stand out from history. The changing mix of subjects is fascinating, too. Before 1900 few women besides monarchs get a look in. They were rarely thought to be worth recording in their own right. More recently, royalty has had to learn to share the gallery's walls with the likes of Charlotte Church and a sleeping David Beckham. The portraits we keep as a nation themselves give a picture of the way we have changed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
