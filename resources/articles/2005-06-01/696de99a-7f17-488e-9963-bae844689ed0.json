One balloon crashed on to a barbed wire fence protecting Ministry of Defence land, while another touched down in the middle of a busy road. A third snagged itself on a tree. The chaos, which led to emergency switchboards being bombarded, is believed to have been caused by sudden changes in the wind. Experts said it was not uncommon for balloons to lose altitude because of a change of weather, but it is relatively rare for so many to come down in a town at the same time. The balloons began dropping out of the sky on Thursday evening. Chris Chorley, 56, was enjoying dinner in his garden in Bath when he noticed they were having problems. Mr Chorley, a civil servant, said: \"I was having dinner in the garden when they began to congregate in the sky. They seemed to be having trouble getting any lift at all. \"One got so close to my garden the people in it said, 'nice supper'.\" The balloons are thought to have taken off from Bath's Royal Victoria park at 6pm. One had to land at the MoD offices in Warminster Road, while another briefly touched down in Bathwick Street before being whisked back into the sky. Yesterday another balloon, this one from Swindon, got into trouble. It struggled across the river Avon before snagging itself on a tree. Police said nobody was injured."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
