It was at T in the Park 2011, an otherwise unmemorable weekend festival in Scotland. During her main-stage performance, the woman then known as Ke$ha told the crowd that she had one pressing question. \u201cIs there,\u201d she said, prolonging the anticipation, \u201cenough glitter on my titties?\u201d The noisy consensus was no, there was not, so her accomplices doused her in a can of lager and an explosion of gold that left her looking like the daughter of C-3PO and Dolly Parton. These gleeful exploits defined Kesha Rose Sebert as a pop star for a while. She followed her defiantly trashy 2010 debut, Animal, with the equally riotous Warrior in 2012, becoming a trailblazer for hedonistic pop. Then she disappeared. In 2016, a new image emerged: Kesha wearing a white suit, sobbing in court as she tried to escape her contract with the producer Dr Luke (AKA Lukasz Gottwald), whom she accused of sexual and emotional abuse including date rape and bullying that led to her developing an eating disorder. He denied the allegations. Her case was dismissed. While she could pick new collaborators, she still had to record for his label, an imprint of Sony, and he countersued for defamation. Kesha\u2019s third album, 2017\u2019s Rainbow, arrived during her legal struggles. While she couldn\u2019t sing about her alleged strife, she made her stance plain: \u201cWhen I\u2019m finished, they won\u2019t even know your name,\u201d she belted on Praying. The rockier, more personal album earned her the best reviews of her career. \u201cI was not used to having nice press,\u201d Kesha says with a small, stunned laugh. \u201cIt was shocking, and also at a time where I so needed kindness.\u201d But the validation left her feeling uneasy. \u201cI don\u2019t feel as if I\u2019m beholden to be a tragedy just because I\u2019ve gone through something that was tragic,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s really important for people to know \u2013 you do not have to be defined by something that was done to you.\u201d It is early October. Kesha, now 32 and newly brunette, has just debuted her new album, High Road, at a glitzy playback for the media. A few downbeat songs aside, her new music revitalises her rowdy trademark sound \u2013 in the way that Tina Turner and Rihanna did after rejecting their own victim narratives. \u201cAfter Praying, people thought I\u2019d always take the high road,\u201d she tells us, handing out tequila. \u201cAnd this song is about getting super fucking high.\u201d A while later, the drink worn off, Kesha sits in a hotel room. She is wearing enough gold chains to deflect a bullet and the glitter is back: translucent blue hearts encrusted beneath her eyes; gothic, bejewelled nails that look like 10 mini Iron Thrones crowning heavily tattooed arms. But she is nervous, speaking carefully and often steering her answers back to her gratitude for her fans\u2019 kindness \u2013 not so much platitudes, more a conversational safety net for a woman legally prevented from discussing certain things. She returns that kindness, too. When I ask for advice about a shared experience, she goes off-record and is so compassionate that I have to pull myself together before continuing. Before starting her fourth album, Kesha didn\u2019t think she deserved to make happy music. \u201cI can be so fucking mean to myself,\u201d she says, sighing at the understatement. Her brother told her she should be writing pop songs, the thing she was good at. \u201cAnd I was pissed!\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t do well with people telling me what to do, and I was so conflicted about what I wanted versus what was expected of me, and trying to please everyone is exhausting.\u201d She wrote her defiance into a rumbling thigh-slapper called My Own Dance: \u201cWhat\u2019s a girl to do? / You\u2019re the party girl / You\u2019re the tragedy / But the funny thing is I\u2019m fucking everything.\u201d She still had to be talked into following the poppy direction it suggested. \u201cThere was an element of not feeling like I should be celebratory because of everything I\u2019ve gone through so publicly.\u201d She pushed through: on High Road, wine is smuggled in handbags, impromptu drunk tattoos are inked, plentiful highs are toked. It is as rebellious for Kesha to make feckless pop now as it was a decade ago. Then, she preached crashing the party, \u201cpissing in the Dom Perignon\u201d and the sexual liberation of women and LGBTQ people. She was seen as an emblem of the post-recession generation, revelling in the wreckage of their promised future. While she wasn\u2019t consciously addressing the economy, she says she related to \u201cgrowing up without extravagance\u201d, recalling her mother, the Nashville songwriter Pebe Sebert, using food stamps. \u201cBut she still found a way to make life very joyful, and I never felt like I went without.\u201d Kesha never knew her father \u2013 never wanted to, although she contemplates what that might have been like on a softer new song, Father Daughter Dance \u2013 and says her childhood fostered her \u201cnihilistic\u201d approach to life: \u201cNothing matters, the world is going to burn up one day so I might as well have a good time while I\u2019m here, because what is the point of life? I don\u2019t know. But I have found that speaking from the heart and creating have made me more able to cope with that intensity.\u201d Kesha\u2019s verve excited Dr Luke. After he heard a country song and a goofy rap number that she had recorded during her mum\u2019s studio time, his interest was piqued by the latter and he brought the teenager to work with him in Los Angeles. The newly christened Ke$ha released her debut single, Tik Tok, in 2009. It spent nine weeks at No 1 in the US and announced the loud arrival of a new pop archetype: the female libertine who brushed her teeth \u201cwith a bottle of Jack\u201d before an all-nighter. The outraged response is quaint to revisit, not least because she steals a pushbike in the video. \u201cThere was some quote that said: \u2018Everyone\u2019s acting like Kesha is walking door to door selling butt plugs and heroin.\u2019 I remember thinking, this is it!\u201d She laughs. \u201cI\u2019m literally talking about everything that men have sung about since the beginning of music.\u201d Not that she minded \u2013 it proved her point. \u201cThe Stooges are my favourite band and Iggy is my god. If I\u2019m not ruffling feathers, I\u2019m not a true child of punk rock.\u201d She started something: soon Miley Cyrus became the twerking, tongue-lolling Miley Cyrus, Sia\u2019s self-obliteration anthems reigned and Icona Pop\u2019s I Love It (\u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d) gave a generation its soundtrack. But 10 years on, pop has gone dark, its stars battling anxiety over political and environmental apocalypse. While Kesha isn\u2019t surprised, she still thinks escapism is a noble pursuit. \u201cSince the beginning of making music, I wanted to make people happy.\u201d Though she has had to redefine her own version of escapism. She has alleged that Dr Luke repeatedly told her that all she was supposed to be was fun, and that he limited her music\u2019s emotional reach to capitalise on this image. Meanwhile, she stated in legal filings, he put her \u201cunder immense pressure to starve myself\u201d, an endeavour that she says nearly killed her. She went to rehab for an eating disorder in 2014 and ditched the dollar sign from her name. These days, she doesn\u2019t care how anyone thinks she looks: \u201cMy body, my business\u201d is her abiding philosophy. Understandably, she doesn\u2019t care if anyone thinks that her return to pop is \u201cinauthentic\u201d. She avoided Auto-Tune and rapping on Rainbow because it didn\u2019t feel right. Both are back on High Road. \u201cAnd the beauty of it is that it was under my consent,\u201d she says pointedly. She has always wanted to be more involved with music production, and recalls a cross-country road trip with her brother in her teens: she was making beats in the sweltering car, only pausing recording to open a window so they didn\u2019t faint. Luke gave her little creative control. She executive-produced Rainbow and High Road and her new collaborators have to respect her assertiveness, but being respected in the studio is still not always a given. \u201cI\u2019ve realised it\u2019s OK to have boundaries, to have an opinion and to know what you want,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t make you a bitch.\u201d While she prizes her authority in the studio, vulnerability has become a survival mechanism. \u201cI spent a lot of my career and life thinking the way to protect myself was to be strong: I don\u2019t give a fuck, you can\u2019t hurt me,\u201d she says. But to witness the music industry laud her emotional honesty sometimes felt like another kind of expoitation. As part of the 2018 Grammy awards\u2019 support of #TimesUp, Kesha performed Praying, backed by female musicians including Cyndi Lauper and Camila Cabello. She wept at the end. It was moving, but left a bad taste: a woman exposing her pain for the industry that allegedly enabled it, on a night where only one woman won a major award and the Grammys president suggested women \u201cstep up\u201d if they wanted recognition. Kesha\u2019s lasting memory of the night is one of solidarity, \u201cgetting a giant hug from all these people that the media had previously pitted against each other. It was us saying no.\u201d She considers my perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting because I was putting a very traumatic experience on display, but it was something I consented to. I was also terrified. But if something terrifies me, I feel like it may be important. Even if it sounds like utter hell and I just weep on the microphone, at least I tried.\u201d The #MeToo movement saddens her. \u201cThat enough people have been assaulted and treated poorly that there has to be an entire movement,\u201d she says. She has no idea whether things have changed for younger, apparently freer peers such as Billie Eilish \u201cbecause you never really know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes. Because for a long period, people had no idea what was going on behind the scenes with me.\u201d The backdrop to the revelry of Kesha\u2019s fourth album is ongoing legal strife: her second appeal against Dr Luke\u2019s defamation case was denied in October; the case is ongoing. To cope, she says she has to avoid living in the past, or thinking too much about the future. \u201cI truly feel like I\u2019ve been through the shit and I have earned my happiness back,\u201d she says emphatically. \u201cI have God only knows the amount of therapy bills and meditation apps and transcendental meditation retreats.\u201d She thrusts her right fist open in emphasis, revealing an eye tattooed on her palm. But she hasn\u2019t softened. In May, she attended a Grammys event wearing a diamante muzzle to protest against Alabama\u2019s abortion ban. She didn\u2019t anticipate a renewed assault on reproductive rights when she was singing about sex so freely 10 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s really archaic,\u201d she says. She describes the era when American iconography \u2013 the dollar sign and flag \u2013 littered her work as \u201ca very different time\u201d. It was subversive, but also a bit patriotic. \u201cObama was president. We agreed upon not everything, but a lot of things.\u201d She would be unlikely to wear the stars and stripes today. \u201cVery basic human rights \u2013 women\u2019s rights, trans rights, gay rights, gun control \u2013 are being challenged and ruining people\u2019s lives. The basis of my constitution is all humans should be treated equally and lovingly.\u201d She sighs. \u201cMusicians used to be the rebellious ones. But now I feel an overwhelming responsibility to be as empathetic and kind and loving and as safe of a place as humanly possible for people.\u201d She thinks back to staging her first cruise in February \u2013 it sailed from Florida to the Bahamas and saw her play to fans alongside other acts including Betty Who, Girl Talk and Big Freedia. She had no idea what to expect and was moved by her fans\u2019 community spirit. While often \u201ctotally fucked, walking around naked\u201d, they looked after one another. There was one guy she\u2019ll never forget, who was paralysed from the neck down. \u201cThe other fans were helping him dance with his arms because he didn\u2019t have control over them, and putting glitter in his beard,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was so beautiful to see people being so kind and understanding and allowing each other to be exactly who the fuck they wanted.\u201d Here was what defined her, a reclaimed kingdom built on debauchery and respect. High Road is released on 10 Jan 2020 on RCA."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
