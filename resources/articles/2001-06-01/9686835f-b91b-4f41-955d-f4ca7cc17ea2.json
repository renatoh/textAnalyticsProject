Investors dumped shares in both companies yesterday - Lloyds TSB slumped 32.5p to 715p, while Abbey National fell 74p to \u00a312.21. The report is thought likely to urge new trade and industry secretary Patricia Hewitt to block the deal, or to impose strict remedies which may prompt Lloyds TSB to drop its bid. Ms Hewitt has 20 working days to consider the report, before announcing a decision on the tie-up. Many banking analysts believe the deal will be blocked. If it allows the deal, the government may order Lloyds to sell its Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester mortgage business, which would significantly reduce the savings achievable from the merger. A less extreme condition would be for Lloyds to pay a higher rate of interest on its current accounts - a combination of the two banks would have a 27% share of the market for current accounts. Mark Thomas, a banking analyst at investment bank Fox-Pitt Kelton, said: \"I think there is a one in three chance that the deal will be barred.\" If this happened, he said, \"it would be a blow to the credibility of Lloyds TSB but in economic terms, the deal is irrelevant - it would contribute only 10% of the profit which Lloyds TSB would deliver organically.\" The decision will be among the first big issues facing Ms Hewitt. She also faces a tricky competition decision over Interbrew's takeover of Bass Brewers, which has been referred back to the government by the High Court."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
