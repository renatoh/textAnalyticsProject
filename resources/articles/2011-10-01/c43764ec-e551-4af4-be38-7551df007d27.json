The man's a professional. And the defence secretary clearly rates him very highly. For many were surprised to hear Dr Fox tell the Commons that Werritty \u2013 who has now assisted Cabinet Office inquiries \u2013 worked for him as \"a paid intern\". It has never been a given that Dr Fox would pay his interns. Our friends at Interns Anonymous point us to one example, a 2009 advertisement placed by Fox as shadow secretary of state when he sought someone to provide \"research support for policy development\". The salary; nil, nada, zero, nothing. Still, if you don't even pay peanuts, you don't get Werritty's. \u2022 \"Unfortunate \u2026 lost opportunity \u2026 trust fallen away \u2026 must find better way\" \u2013 the great and the good of the Commission on 2020 Public Services delivered a suitably damning verdict today on Voldemort Lansley's NHS reforms. And who do we find among the signatories? Why, none other than Stephen Dorrell, Tory chair of the health select committee. A man who, when asked by David Dimbleby on Question Time whether he wanted Lansley's job, could only simper coquettishly. The commission says that its verdict is a \"shared judgment\" representing \"the balance of views across our group rather than the views of any one individual\". No doubt Dorrell spoke up for Voldemort. No doubt. \u2022 An interesting evening in prospect as the gilded flowers of Eton invite Class War founder Ian Bone to deliver a lecture. He is one of many distinguished speakers to address sixth-formers in recent years. But there is a particular history to this. Bone keeps busy, and most recently one of his campaigns, inspired by the stand-off at Dale Farm, has been a move to occupy Eton's playing fields. Tensions are rising on the veteran troublemaker's blog. \"I would not return to Eton if I were you,\" warns one critic. \"For although they are disciplined, the school may take legal action and you will lose. Eton College has influence over every level of society.\" Another is more direct. \"Sometimes I wish that there was anarchy because then I could easily kill wankers like yourself without retribution,\" he says. One, styling himself Dirty Miguel, seems the feistiest. \"If you anarchist bitches wanna play ball then bring it.\" And Class War do like a ruck. Oh dear. \u2022 Another clash of heads, this time in Oxford, where Christians irked by Richard Dawkins' refusal to debate with their champion, the US philosopher William Lane Craig, have hit back by spending \u00a38,000 on bus advertisements. Thirty buses are now trundling around Oxford, where Dawkins lives, bearing the banner There's Probably No Dawkins. He is on tour in the US, and so won't have seen them. Still, they'll be running when he returns for a speaking engagement in the city on the 28th. \u2022 And as the Leveson inquiry into journalistic ethics sifts through the dirty linen, old hands from the supermarket tabloids in the US wonder why the fuss? They made our hacks look like Mother Theresa. According to the Gentleman Ranters website, a home for journalistic memories, reporters on the National Enquirer took a particular palm tree close to the office as a place of refuge. It was well out of sight and earshot of the paper's tyrannical owner, Gene Pope, \"a man whose word was law and whose edicts were often so bizarre they prompted those unfortunate to hear them to laugh uproariously. But never in his presence, of course.\" There was one stampede to the tree by hacks who \"had just been tasked with the high-seas hijacking of the Queen Mary. Pope, apparently, had decided such high-profile targets were vulnerable to piracy and wanted to demonstrate how easy it was.\" Another rush occurred when Pope \"made it plain he wanted to sponsor the first human head transplant. 'If they can transplant a heart, they can transplant a head,' the fount of all knowledge said'.\" One reporter recalls being yelled at for disobeying the owner's edict that his story should begin with the last words uttered by Elvis. But his last words were, \"Dearest, I'm going to the bathroom,\" the chastised reporter said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
