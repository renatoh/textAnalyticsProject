Blogposts for all five seasons will feature \u2013 as well as many, many of your comments, which have made this blog the great forum it is. Thank you for all your suggestions for the title last week. We will bring you further details soon. Season three, episode seven \u2013 would legalising drugs be so wrong? Bubbles is a man who has enjoyed the highs and suffered the lows, but his journey through Hamsterdam is particularly dark. So dark that he stays clean. Hamsterdam at night is portrayed as Dante's Inferno made real, a vision of hell, junkies shooting up in the street and public sexual favours for a score. It looks much worse even than the normally miserable scene you would associate with drug dens. Johnny, in his messed up state, calls it \"paradise\". In the same episode Bunny, whose brainwave all this was, gets new stats that reveal that crime is down in the district, and markedly down in the areas where the drugs business would be taking place were it not for the existence of Hamsterdam. Later, when Carver is forced to tell Jimmy and Kima about the \"free zone\", Greggs can't quite get over the fact that drugs have been legalised, while McNulty is more understanding, either because, as real pOlice, he knows that there are more important crimes to eliminate than drug taking (such as murder, in a town with a horrific homicide rate) or because he just likes giving a fuck when it isn't his turn. When his old boss, Bunny, explains the situation \u2013 McNulty: \"And the bosses don't know?\" Colvin: \"Fuck the bosses\" \u2013 that's Jimmy's kind of language. The Hamsterdam storyline follows a real-life Baltimore initiative, when mayor Kurt L Schmoke had the temerity to suggest decriminalising drugs. America has a long and unhappy history with the criminalisation of substances that some (many!) people find enjoyable. In the 1930s, prohibition didn't stop alcohol, it merely drove it underground and created a criminal culture around it. The present-day war on drugs has had much the same effect. That is certainly The Wire's take on it. The show is loaded with dialogue about how the war can never be won and the story arc that sees one kingpin replaced seamlessly by another certainly suggests that the participants may change but the business goes on. And it is a business. A lucrative one. And because it is illegal it is accompanied by guns and murder. Which of course begs several questions. Why fight a war that can't be won? Why decide that alcohol is fine but other drugs (notice I say \"other drugs\") are not? Alcohol, by dint of its legal standing, is considered socially acceptable, and yet is a major factor in significant levels of crime (domestic violence, road deaths) and social disintegration. Marijuana leaves its takers much less likely to fight than drunks. More likely to eat a lot of chocolate, but that is a much less serious social problem, I think. Of course the drugs that are being taken on these mean streets are harder than marijuana. Cocaine in all its forms is highly addictive. But so is alcohol. Marijuana use does not necessarily lead to cocaine and heroin use, just as alcohol does not automatically lead to methylated spirits. And, were they legalised, it would at the very least force the organised crime around it to move elsewhere. Quote of the week: \"What are you, a fucking communist?\" Herc to Carver after the latter forces dealers in Hamsterdam to take better care of their employees. Running totals Murders: up one to 49. Snoop (dressed like a girl!) guns down Rico from the back of a motorbike. Poot narrowly escapes. McNulty giving a fuck when it's not his turn: up two to 24, having gone behind Daniels's back (again) and backed up Bunny. Drunk: up one to 16: although we don't see him drinking, we know that it was he who got Kima legless before her domestic dispute. Dubious parenting: no sign of the kids. Still six. Bunk drunk: he's sober, recovering missing guns and cutting ties (of the neck variety). Still five. Herc fuck-ups: up one to eight and a half (if we are being unkind and counting his inability to remember Avon's full name, but not if we think that he did at least spot him). Omar stick-ups: none. The gunman was in pensive mood mulling Bunk's ministrations. Still seven. Bubbles attempting to get clean: up one to three (as long as we count his hesitant declining of Johnny's offer)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
