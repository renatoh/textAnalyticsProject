Lidl said the package of four primary school essentials \u2013 comprising two polo shirts, a sweater and trousers or pleated skirt \u2013 would go on sale for \u00a33.75 next Thursday. In response its rival Aldi slashed its earlier offer of \u00a34 for its Back to School uniform \u2013 the same items \u2013 to just \u00a33.69. The parallel moves undercut other high street retailers by as much as 80%. Aldi fired the opening shots in the new price war in June, when it launched its \u00a34 uniform package \u2013 offering a round-neck sweater for just \u00a31.25, a two-pack of plain polo shirts for \u00a31.25 and a school skirt or pair of trousers for \u00a31.50 \u2013 adding up to \u00a34. But cutting the price further this week, Tony Baines, managing director for corporate buying at Aldi, said: \u201cIn order to deliver outstanding quality at unbeatable prices, we have reduced the retail price of our Back to School uniform package from \u00a34 to \u00a33.69.\u201d Lidl said its collection \u2013 comprising 41 separate items and including 100% cotton fabrics and leather shoes \u2013 could save British families with two children up to \u00a32,854 over their entire primary school education. The discounter claims it offers an 80% saving compared to John Lewis\u2019s uniform range. At John Lewis, the same items cost \u00a319, at Marks &amp; Spencer they are \u00a315, Sainsbury\u2019s \u00a313.50, Tesco \u00a38.50 and at Asda \u00a37.50. \u201cOver the course of seven years at primary school, parents can find themselves racking up thousands of pounds in the cost of school uniforms, which can be especially tough on families with more than one child,\u201d said Josie Stone, non-food buying manager for Lidl UK. At this time of year, internet talkboards such as Mumsnet are dominated by parents\u2019 concerns that cheap, mass-produced, poor quality school uniforms are a false economy, as they will not last long when worn and washed regularly. Aldi said its range, in sizes 4-11, had been praised for its quality in independent tests. Lidl insisted that, despite the price, product quality had not been overlooked. But earlier this year the chain sparked controversy when it offered a pair of jeggings for just \u00a35.99 at its 600-plus UK stores. The items were manufactured in Bangladesh, where the minimum legal wage for a garment worker is 23p an hour. Lidl said the school uniforms were made in Bangladesh and China. Martin Buttle, head of apparel and textiles at the Ethical Trading Initiative, said: \u201cPaying an extra couple of pounds on a school uniform is not normally a massive cost to a UK consumer, but the difference can be huge to a Bangladeshi or Chinese garment worker.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
