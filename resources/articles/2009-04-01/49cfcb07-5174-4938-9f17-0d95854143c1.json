Liam Lawrence, whose goal ensured that one of the most written-off teams in the Premier League's history would survive with a month to go, collapsed on his back and gazed up into the blue sky above him. Abdoulaye Faye dashed round the stadium in a kind of high-stepping dance. Thomas Sorensen and James Beattie met by the centre circle and embraced. As in any cup final, the result was all. The game had been a thing of high balls, long throws and hard, hard tackles. It seems strange that a city famed for its bone china and porcelain, and which was dazzled by Stanley Matthews, should produce such harsh, sometimes brutal, football but Stoke City, unlike Wedgewood, have survived. And they could not have done so without it. Sam Allardyce had remarked before kick-off that going to Stoke now carried the same degree of difficulty as a trip to Anfield, and the Blackburn players bore their manager out. In both matches they did not manage a worthwhile shot. There were only two in the match and both fell to Lawrence. From the second, he scored his first goal since Aston Villa were beaten here in August. Had he not missed three months of the season because of an ankle injury sustained when tripping over his labrador on the stairs, there would have been more. \"It was the biggest game of our careers out there and I just collapsed on the floor because I had nothing left to give,\" Lawrence said. \"I didn't get much sleep last night because for us this was like being in the European Cup final. Everything was going through my head \u2013 whether we would win or if I would score. I got up and watched some TV and, luckily, the dog was in the kennels.\" To understand what this result meant to Stoke you would have to go back to 1984-85, the most humiliating season in the club's history. It had been their last in the top flight and saw them relegated with 17 points, a low that was broken by the Sunderland side Lawrence played in. There were some, not least the publicity-seeking bookies who paid out on Stoke's relegation after they lost their first match at Bolton, who expected a repetition. Those same bookies were yesterday offering 16-1 against Stoke going down. \"Relegation and the thought of it is horrible,\" said Lawrence. \"It was horrible at Sunderland. We didn't want to be going to Arsenal needing a win or a draw on the last day \u2013 Ars\u00e8ne Wenger hates us anyway.\" Allardyce's attempt to salvage Blackburn began in December against Stoke. Then, he thought it might take half-a-dozen fixtures to pull out of the relegation zone. Four months later they stand three points clear of the drop and, if they are to survive, Blackburn, like Stoke, will have to rely on home form. Wigan, West Bromwich and Portsmouth all have to come to Ewood Park and Allardyce believes perhaps five points might see them safe. \"We are not where I thought we'd be,\" he said. \"We have thrown away far too many valuable points that we thought we'd had in the bank. Now, there is suddenly a big pressure to produce a win against Wigan.\" Man of the match Liam Lawrence (Stoke) There were only two shots on target in the entire game - both from Stoke's Liam Lawrence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
