Scotland\u2019s woeful performance in drawing with Lithuania on Saturday evening was alarming enough for beleaguered Tartan Army foot soldiers before Strachan provided the latest glimpses of his signing up for the flat earth society. No sooner had James McArthur snatched a last-minute equaliser than Strachan spoke of bad luck, outstanding displays and similar. Scotland have been in this movie far too often for anyone to take their manager\u2019s bullishness at face value. Strachan was effusive, to the point of being condescending to anyone with eyes in their head, after the dismal defeat in Georgia in September last year that spiked an already stuttering run towards Euro 2016. Strachan could not be allowed to contemplate Tuesday evening\u2019s now crunch tie in Slovakia without further assessment of what arrived immediately before. For a manager who prides himself on preparation and the drilling home of tactical instructions to players, it should have been astonishing to Strachan that Scotland played with such a lack of cohesion when Lithuania visited Glasgow. To the untrained eye, and without knowing Strachan\u2019s conscientiousness, this looked like a group of players sent out with no plan. Ticket prices notwithstanding, the sight of more than 10,000 empty seats at Hampden Park told a story of its own. Strachan needs action to back up words, and soon. \u201cYou are being silly if you are suggesting there were no tactics,\u201d claimed Strachan on Sunday. \u201cThe tactics were to get the ball to our wide men, get the full-backs in, one of the midfield players tucks in on one side and allows Andy Robertson to go round there [from left-back]. \u201cYou see Robertson tackling, Matt Ritchie comes in, Oliver Burke stays a wee bit further, Burke tries to spin in and go behind them. If he doesn\u2019t get that he stays and plays as a striker, if he comes out of there Robert Snodgrass goes into there, the two midfield players stay together to pick off their one midfield player who goes there, then when the ball moves up to there one of the midfield players goes up to that position, when it is wide we try to get four people into the box. That was the tactics. \u201cIf we cannot get through them we chip diagonal balls to Chris Martin into his chest. If you see in the first half we got two good moves out of three from that.\u201d All of this failed to acknowledge the basic means by which to beat modest opposition: namely moving the ball quickly and accurately. Martin, who has not scored in 20 club outings, is about as mobile as his 59-year-old international manager. \u201cThe trend that I saw in the European Championship is that there is a bigger striker playing up front for most countries,\u201d said Strachan. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to be the quickest, they just have to bring other people into play.\u201d It was damning to hear Scotland\u2019s manager admit his approach was \u201cnot that much\u201d different to the away fixture in Malta last month. Steven Naismith and Steven Fletcher are among those likely to come into Strachan\u2019s thoughts forTuesday. Slovakia have troubles of their own after Saturday\u2019s loss in Slovenia ensured zero points from two Group F games. \u201cWe hoped to take something anyway,\u201d said Strachan. \u201cBut yes, of course we need something now. The less you\u2019ve won, the more you need to pick up points further on. That\u2019s common sense. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a crazy group. It\u2019s a crazy group already. From pot two, Slovakia haven\u2019t got any points yet. Slovenia, who beat Slovakia, got a draw at Lithuania but Lithuania could have been three up before they were pegged back. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a crazy group, then the team from pot two goes through. And we\u2019re pot four. If it wasn\u2019t crazy, then it\u2019s quite simple. We go home because we\u2019re the pot four team. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that the difference could be getting a big result away from home. This is an opportunity. There are four opportunities and we need to get one of those big results away from home if we\u2019re going to try to get second. I don\u2019t know if a win takes Slovakia out of the running but it makes it very hard for them, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d This point, at least, was indisputable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
