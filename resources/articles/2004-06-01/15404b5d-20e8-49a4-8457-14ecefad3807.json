French rider Philippe Gaumont accused his Cofidis team-mates of having taken banned substances in January, after he admitted taking the banned substance EPO. Seven of the Cofidis team - including Philippe Gaumount, Robert Sassone, Mederic Clain, Marek Rutkiewicz and Daniel Majewski were charged with doping offences. But Miller is being treated as a witness, not a suspect. The charged players, along with the Corfidis physio, Boguslaw Madejak, and an ex-manager of their third division team, Oleg Kozlitine, have all since left the team or been sacked."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
