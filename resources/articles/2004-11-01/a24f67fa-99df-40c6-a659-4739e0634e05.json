Rain had fallen every day for almost two weeks before England arrived in the Namibian capital on Tuesday, and it has continued intermittently since. The weather is due to clear before the warm-up matches against Namibia on Sunday and Tuesday, but much of what England came here for has already been lost. They fly to Harare on Wednesday. Three of Zimbabwe's rebel cricketers have withdrawn from a resolution process set up by the International Cricket Council in July to settle their long-running dispute with Zimbabwe Cricket. Heath Streak, Stuart Carlisle and Trevor Gripper have lost faith in the ICC's efforts to find a solution, according to their lawyer, Chris Venturas. The ICC recently ruled that there was no evidence of racism in Zimbabwe Cricket. \"Essentially we just couldn't afford the high legal fees involved, especially as we are down to three with everybody else making new lives elsewhere,\" said Carlisle. \"We agreed that the tribunal would not have got us anywhere.\" Jacob Oram was unbeaten on 63 in helping New Zealand to recover from 138 for five to 250 for seven on the opening day of the first Test against Australia at Brisbane. Michael Kasprowicz took three wickets before Mathew Sinclair responded with a gritty 69. Shane Warne then extended his world-record tally to 543 wickets with the wickets of Craig McMillan and Brendon McCullum."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
