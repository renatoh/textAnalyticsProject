I aspire to not pay taxes myself. I consider taxes mafia-style theft.\u201d The president, who was raised in the city\u2019s sprawling borough of Queens before spending most of his adult life as a real estate developer at the heart of fast-paced city life and business in Manhattan, announced that he was moving his tax domicile to Florida. There he owns his private resort club Mar-a-Lago in the wealthy community of Palm Beach and can expect to avoid New York state\u2019s top tax rate of nearly 9% and New York city\u2019s top rate of nearly 4%. Trump has never released his tax returns, either as a candidate or since becoming the Republican president of the United States after the 2016 election, thus flouting presidential convention and resisting efforts by the US Congress and New York state and city authorities to force him to disclose them. He confirmed the decision to move his permanent residence to Florida on Twitter, saying of himself and his wife, Melania Trump, that he would \u201cbe making Palm Beach, Florida, our Permanent Residence\u201d. Trump has spent only 20 nights at his 58th-floor penthouse home at the Trump Tower skyscraper on Fifth Avenue in New York since becoming president. So his decision to abandon the city is largely symbolic. But in his message, Trump said he felt mistreated by the city\u2019s political leaders. \u201cFew have been treated worse,\u201d he said, and described his decision as the \u201cbest for all concerned\u201d. With that at least, New Yorker Virginia Doty largely agreed. \u201cGood riddance,\u201d she told said. \u201cGood luck in Florida. He\u2019s useless. He pays no taxes here. What do we need him for? He just trouble, and its inconvenient when he comes to town. So long. Wish you all the best.\u201d New York political leaders shared that sentiment. \u201cGood riddance,\u201d the governor, Andrew Cuomo, tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Mr. Trump paid taxes here anyway. He\u2019s all yours, Florida.\u201d Others were less charitable. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful \u2013 he already makes everything so that they benefit him,\u201d said paralegal Jason Winn. \u201cHe\u2019s rich. He should stay and pay his fair share \u2026 and maybe more.\u201d But some were realistic about the contribution high earners make to the city\u2019s coffers. \u201cI know people who make a lot of money in New York also get taxed a lot more but I think if he was more responsible he\u2019d stay,\u201d said Wall Street finance worker Natalie Nakamura. \u201cBut he\u2019s not \u2013 he\u2019s self-interested. That\u2019s always been pretty apparent.\u201d Some closer to retirement age said they were thinking of doing the same thing. Florida has long been a place for the wealthy to escape the higher taxes that come with living in a city that likes to think of itself as the capital of the world. \u201cIt\u2019s about taxes, man,\u201d said insurance broker John Curley. \u201cWhy would you want to live in New York if you could retire somewhere you\u2019re not taxed? Everybody makes their own decisions. But it\u2019s bad for New York because it\u2019s going to miss out on his taxes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
