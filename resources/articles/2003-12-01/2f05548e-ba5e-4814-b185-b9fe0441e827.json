Fran\u00e7ois Doumen's brilliant staying hurdler was given too much to do by the trainer's son, Thierry, in last year's race when outwitted by Tony McCoy on Deano's Beeno but turned the tables on that rival in the staying hurdlers' championship race at the Cheltenham Festival and had that opponent seven lengths behind at Newbury last time. But no one is going to get rich backing the French raider and the nap bet suggestion on an excellent card is Multeen River (3.10) , who has not been knocked about in any of his races since joining Jonjo O'Neill and could turn out to be on a very fair handicap mark at present. Jakari is the obvious danger in a race in which few make any appeal. This year's Cheltenham Festival Bumper looked an above-average renewal and Trabolgan(1.00) , who finished second to Liberman in that race, should be supported in the opening maiden hurdle. Fast ground and a fast pace will suit Albuhera (3.40) ideally. The Paul Nicholls runner is 7lb better off with Self Defense for a narrow beating at Cheltenham last month but in truth this looks a tricky race with any number of promising types in the field. Odagh Odyssey (1.30) usually needs a run and travelled well for a long way on his reappearance at Folkestone. He is very well in on his chase form and again has the assistance of Tony McCoy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
