Originally published in Germany in 1995 as Die Ringe des Saturn, Sebald\u2019s landmark work of psychogeography and melancholic speculation was translated into English by Michael Hulse and published here in 1998. It was quickly recognised as a classic, garnering ecstatic reviews and topping end-of-year lists. Typical was James Wood\u2019s encomium in the Guardian: Anxious, daring, extreme, muted \u2013 only an annulling wash of contradictory adjectives can approach the agitated density of WG Sebald\u2019s writing. More simply, this German who has lived in England for over 30 years is one of the most exciting and mysteriously sublime of contemporary European writers. That fits our theme of European literature neatly \u2013 although I\u2019m conscious of the irony that we\u2019re going to be reading a book about England, plenty of it set within walking distance of my own house in Norwich. Or, non-walking in Sebald\u2019s case, who details a long period of recuperation spent in the Norfolk and Norwich hospital, as well as the journey he undertook before he injured his back, tramping around coastal Suffolk from Lowestoft to Southwold to Bungay. There\u2019s also far more to The Rings of Saturn than the English landscape. It also takes in the Holocaust, slavery, the decline of herring catches, the destruction of English elms, the lives of silkworms. A few years ago in the Guardian, Paul Macinnes gave a neat example of its variety: \u201cSebald spends two days in Southwold, a spell that prompts a mental journey into the history of colonial exploitation in the Congo and the links between Joseph Conrad and English knight, Irish nationalist and, ultimately, British traitor, Roger Casement.\u201d It\u2019s a strange, potent mix that has inspired many writers in the 20-odd years since it was first published \u2013 but has never yet been matched. I\u2019m looking forward to revisiting it and hope you\u2019ll join me. Just in case you\u2019re still wavering, have a look at what James Wood, Will Self, Iain Sinclair, and Robert Macfarlane have to say about a writer so important he\u2019s earned his own adjective \u2013 and about what it means to be Sebaldian. By way of further encouragement and thanks to Vintage, we have five copies of The Rings of Saturn to give to the first five people from the UK to post \u201cI want a copy please\u201d, along with a nice, constructive suggestion in the comments section below.
