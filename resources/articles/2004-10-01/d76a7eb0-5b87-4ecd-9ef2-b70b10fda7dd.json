The emergence of the interest of Icelandic bank Landsbanki in Numis follows months of speculation that another City firm, Singer &amp; Freidlander, will receive a takeover bid from Iceland's biggest bank Kaupthing. It has also turned the spotlight on the ambitions of Iceland's major companies and their inter-relationships. Kaupthing is the main banker to Baugur, the retail company that is considering a takeover bid for the troubled Big Food Group, the UK concern that owns the Iceland frozen food chain and the Booker cash and carry business. While Baugur has already made its mark in Britain, taking over toy shop Hamley's, clothing companies Oasis and Karen Millen, and Goldsmiths the jewellers, Iceland's banks are still fighting to win complete control of a British financial company. Analysts in Iceland believe the City should not be surprised by the UK ambitions of Icelandic companies, particularly banks despite the relative size of the Icelandic and British economies. \"The banking sector has grown rapidly here. The local market is very small, with only 300,000 people and with only so many businesses. The three main banks [Kaupthing, Islandsbanki and Landsbanki] have grown very fast. The capital structure is strong. The way to grow is to look outside of Iceland,\" said Atli B Gudmundsson, analyst at Islandsbanki. Until yesterday, the City had been most aware of the ambitions of Kaupthing which has amassed a 20% stake in Singer &amp; Freidlander and which this week announced plans for a rights issue which could be used to fund a takeover bid. But another Icelandic financial firm, Burdaras, has also built a stake in Singer &amp; Freidlander, of nearly 10%. And Burdaras is in turn linked to the bank rumoured to have approached Numis, Landsbanki, which owns a major stake in Burdaras. Numis, of which Icap chairman Michael Spencer owns nearly 10%, would not reveal the identity of its spurned bidder. Its shares rose 55p to 610p yesterday. It was reported, however, that the approach was from the once state owned Landsbanki. The bank is now stock market listed but largely controlled by three wealthy individuals - Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson, his father Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson and their business partner Magnus Thorsteinsson. Until Iceland started privatising its banks in the late 1990s, the Icelandic stock market had been dominated by the fish industry. However, the banking sector now dominates the market along with one pharmaceutical company, Actavis, which is also linked to the three individuals who run Landsbanki. But it was Baugur, which is considering using its 22% stake in Big Food Group as a platform for a full takeover bid, which first helped make the City aware of Icelandic companies' ambitions. Baugur made its first foray into the City with an ill-fated takeover attempt of Arcadia, the Top Shop and Dorothy Perkins. Baugur's boss Jon Johannesson already had the franchise for Top Shop in Iceland and wanted control of the whole firm which is now owned by entrepreneur Philip Green. Mr Johannesson has tentatively offered 110p for Big Food Group. But Big Food Group's shares were down 1p at 91.75p yesterday amid concern that Baugur might try to lower the price after Big Food's second quarter trading statement showed the fall in sales was accelerating.
