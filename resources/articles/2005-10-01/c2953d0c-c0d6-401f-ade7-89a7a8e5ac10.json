In contrast to the FTSE 100, which ended the session little changed, ICI advanced 6.5p to 295.5p after a leading broker said third-quarter figures due on November 3 were likely to match City expectations. \"Despite sluggish UK retail sales and raw material costs pressures, we expect ICI to grow earnings year on year driven by cost-cutting, price increases and solid North American demand,\" Deutsche Bank told clients. Those comments helped soothe concerns that ICI, whose shares have underperformed the wider market this month, would follow Tesco, up 0.25p to 302.75p, and Cadbury Schweppes, 4.5p better at 561p, by warning that high oil and gas prices had dented margins. Deutsche Bank was also responsible for one of the sessions other biggest risers - O2. The share price of the mobile phone group improved 4.5p to 164.25p after the German broker said Deutsche Telekom could afford to pay 200p-a-share for O2 and the deal would still enhance earnings. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 settled 6.2 points higher at 5,380.7 as a strong performance from Marks &amp; Spencer, 13.25p stronger at 397.25p, was cancelled out by a weak opening on Wall Street. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 index improved 39.1 points to 7,808.4, while the FTSE Small Cap index firmed three points to to 3,107.1. In the bond market, the 10-year gilt closed around 103.800, yielding 4.275%. Sugar maker Tate &amp; Lyle was the day's biggest blue chip riser, climbing 16p to 475.25p as hedge funds scrambled to buy back their short positions in the wake of positive feedback from a US investor roadshow. Traders reckon Tate is close to announcing an expansion of its Sucralose sweetener business. Scottish &amp; Newcastle was also in demand, gaining 13.75p to 469p on vague bid rumours and reaction to Monday's share purchase by chief executive Tony Froggatt. But Cable &amp; Wireless remained in the doldrums, falling a further 2.75p to 116.25p after Morgan Stanley placed 14m shares for a client at 117p. Trading in PartyGaming was again volatile. It shares slumped to 67p in early trading before bouncing back to 75p and then turning tail to close just 0.5p higher at 71.5p. Dealers pinned PartyGaming's late retreat on rumours that a US broker had set a \"worst-case scenario\" target price of just 24p. Insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson was among the best performers in the FTSE 250. Its shares advanced 40p to 485p after highly-rated insurance team Numis Securities upgraded to buy from sell and set a 535p target price, citing a significantly more positive assessment of revenue growth. Numis also lifted its rating on another insurance broker Benfield, 10.75p higher at 323.75p, to add from sell. Intermediate Capital Group advanced 34p to 1250p after the mezzanine finance provider revealed half-year profits had almost doubled to \u00a378.5m. Numis Securities responded to that news by slapping a 1500p target price on the stock. There was also talk that a European rival had been in the market trying to get hold of a large block of stock. However it was unable to find any sellers below the 1300p level. WH Smith moved up 14.5p to 348.5p as short sellers squared positions ahead of tomorrow's full-year figures. On the downside, house broker ABN Amro called time on the recent strong run of engineering group Charter. Lowering his recommendation to hold from buy, ABN analyst Phil Oakley said Charter needed to improve its cash flow performance to justify further share price outperformance. Boosted by strong demand for its welding products, Charter shares have risen 73% this year but they fell 9.5p to 393.5p yesterday. Among the small caps Stanelco, the packaging technology specialist, fell 1.75p to 12.25p in heavy volume amid rumours that several analysts had moved to lower their forecasts. Elsewhere Agcert International, the carbon emissions trading group, gained 20p to 151.5p after an overhang was cleared. On Monday, blue chip US bank Morgan Stanley started coverage of the company with an overweight rating. Construction group Mowlem eased 0.5p to 169.5p despite Cantor Fitzgerald declaring an increased stake of 6.5%. Market professionals believe Cantor is warehousing the stock on behalf of a high-profile client. On Aim, Biofocus was one of the best performers. Its shares advanced 29p to 144p tracking the 11% rise of Galapagos, the Belgian biotech group that recently launched a \u00a320m cash and stock offer for Biofocus. Heading in the other direction was Forminster, which plunged 6p, or 37.5%, to 10p after the company revealed its franchise agreement with French retailer Kookai would not be renewed. White Nile, the oil exploration group that claims to have found 5bn barrels of crude in war-torn south Sudan, closed above the 100p for the first time since August. Phil Edmonds, the former Test cricketer and White Nile's founder, is rumoured to be in the US drumming up demand for the stock. The shares rose 3p to 104p. What next? Next was under pressure yesterday amid fears that its core high street clothing business is continuing to suffer. Next recently revealed a weak start to the second half of its fiscal year, with same store sales down 6% in the six weeks since the end of July. However, with several major competitors proving that they are coping well in the tough retail environment, analysts believe Next is still struggling. \"With the biggest competitor of them all, Marks &amp; Spencer, now bouncing back it would be a wonder if Next Retail were not continuing to suffer significant like-for-like sales declines,\" Investec Securities said as it cut \u00a38m off its profits forecast for this year. Next shares, which have underperformed the wider market by 26% this year, fell 8p to 1353p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
