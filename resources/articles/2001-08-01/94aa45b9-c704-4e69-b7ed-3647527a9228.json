Brown was in the Irish capital to watch Scotland's next opponents in the World Cup qualifying series, Croatia, play the Republic in a warm-up and admitted that he did experience an unaccustomed sensation when Mirko Jozic and Mick McCarthy, the respective managers, started showing off with substitutes. It was most specifically in attack that Brown was reminded of his own problems. McCarthy was able to remove one partnership, Damien Duff and Robbie Keane, and replace it with another, Clinton Morrison and David Connolly. All this, and Niall Quinn still to be summoned when fitness permits. Jozic, who succeeded Miroslav Blazevic as coach of Croatia following Scotland's 1-1 draw in Zagreb last year, enjoyed the same luxury, withdrawing Alen Boksic and Bosko Balaban to make way for Davor Suker and Davor Vugrinec. What would have been even more poignant for the Scotland manager would be the fact that substitutes Suker, Vugrinec and Morrison all scored, the latter to give the home side a 2-0 lead before Vugrinec struck with a well placed header and Suker converted an impeccable penalty kick to make the final score 2-2. Since Duff had opened the scoring for the Irish in the first half, Brown was able to reflect on the unusual phenomenon of all the goals coming from strikers. This is not something for which Scotland are famous. The most prolific scorer in the present squad is Don Hutchison, essentially a midfielder, while the most productive recognised striker, Billy Dodds, is unable to command a place in Rangers' first team. 'I wouldn't envy either Mick or Jozic anything, but I must admit that the idea of having that number of forwards at their disposal does make your mouth water,' said Brown. 'But I remain optimistic about these things, I go into every match convinced that we'll get the goal or goals we need from somewhere and now is no different. 'Yes, it would be better for us if Billy Dodds was playing for his club, as he was in terrific form in our last two World Cup ties, when he scored two against Belgium and one against San Marino. But he wasn't a regular with Rangers then, either, so I'm not too despondent about him.' Brown's resources are limited enough, nevertheless, to have caused him to travel to Holland on Friday to watch Scott Booth in a league match with Twente Enschede. The former Aberdeen striker was recalled to the national squad last spring for the first time since the 1998 World Cup and, although he has yet to convince anyone that he has rediscovered the form that made him such a promising young player, he will almost certainly be called for duty. Brown names his squad on Thursday for the double header with Croatia at Hampden Park on 1 September and Belgium in Brussels four days later and, in terms of having influential players match fit, he is already walking on glass. Barry Ferguson, the Rangers midfielder, is already a certain absentee and his clubmate, Neil McCann, missed yesterday's match with Hibs and is not expected to be ready for the Ibrox side's Champions League match against Fenerbahce in Istanbul on Wednesday. McCann has frequently made significant contributions to the national side, most notably when he scored the only goal of the opening match in the World Cup qualifying series in Latvia. More than anything, however, Brown regards him as a reliable provider of crosses for the marauding Hutchison. 'You'd want to see McCann there,' said the manager, 'as he delivers a good ball into areas where Hutchison comes in from deep positions. They've worked well in the past together and I can see them upsetting defenders, if given the chance. I'm told McCann should be recovered by next weekend, the Saturday before we play Croatia and, if he gets even part of a game then to confirm his fitness, that will be good enough for me.' The most irritating aspect of Brown's shortage of recognised strikers is that, on the evidence of Croatia's outing against Ireland, they may be vulnerable in defence. Brown noted that their tall players at the back, particularly Igor Tudor, seemed to be unsettled by smaller, quicker players such as Duff and Keane 'getting in about him'. Brown is much less concerned about midfield, where Paul Lambert, Craig Burley, Colin Cameron, Jackie McNamara, Scot Gemmill and Hutchison are all available. There has been in the past few days a media campaign to recall Gary McAllister, the Liverpool veteran who quit the international game after being booed by home fans in the 2-1 defeat by the Czech Republic in a Euro 2000 qualifier at Parkhead. Brown has said that he would only ever return to McAllister in an emergency and the player himself has said he would not leave his friend in the lurch. But Brown made it clear the other day that it would have to be the kind of emergency in which martial law is declared. 'We have so much cover in midfield that there will be no need to trouble Gary,' he said. 'Everybody knows his situation and that won't change. He has made his feelings quite clear and I think too much of him, have too much respect for him, to start giving him dilemmas.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
