Every night, much to our amusement, she'd totter along the beach to dinner in her wooden blocks. But she didn't care, she was besotted by her shoes. Paul &amp; Joe has this effect on you. The label manages to be feminine, cool and chic. And if you're looking for something girly - a floral chiffon top, a kitten-print camisole, a jersey draped dress - or great cut-off jeans, if you want to treat yourself to this season's make-up colours and you've got a weakness for fab packaging (the kittens again), then you'll be as happy as I am that a Paul &amp; Joe boutique has opened on London's Sloane Street. Paul &amp; Joe has been delighting the fashion set since the late Nineties, when designer Sophie Albou launched the label - named after her two sons. The first of four London franchise stores was opened by the Metta family in Notting Hill, in 1999. Mother-and-daughter team Mireille and Marcelle Metta added their label Mamie to Albou's collection. The range, based on their love of vintage fabric, increased Paul &amp; Joe's following with those in search of one-off pieces. From the elegant Brompton Road store, Diana Metta launched her own jewellery range, Scarletta, in 2002 - vintage pieces inspired by her grandmother's treasure box of jewels. The Floral Street men's store opened in 2003, stocking womenswear a year later due to demand. The latest edition to the empire is the Sloane Street Store is the most decadent of all. In addition to the spring range, it will be introducing the Paul &amp; Joe children's range. A lifestyle range of cushions, sheets and blankets emblazoned with eye-catching motifs will be introduced in August. Other brands are stocked, but exclusive Paul &amp; Joe pieces will be designed for the shop. So if you're after a one-off gift or a pretty summer pick-me-up, head down to Sloane Street. \u00b7 Paul &amp; Joe, 134 Sloane St, London SW1 (020 7824 8844) jo.adams@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
