I'm in Trafalgar Square with around a thousand protesters watching two guys who've climbed on top of a van, and who are greatly enjoying the attention. You read it here first: tomorrow's newspaper front page is these two guys - one a punk, together with hand gestures to the police, the other looks like and thinks he's Jesus. It's a good-natured end to a decent day. At 2pm, when we met at arms company Lockheed Martin, the police were quick to cordon the approximataly 2,000 protesters off in a cordon, just like they did two years ago. Apart from occasional scuffles and charges, it went off peacefully and one by one people were let out - on the promise they wouldn't return. Another breakaway group managed to get to the Strand, close to the Shell headquarters, and waited for the rest to join them. Then there was a good-natured march down the Strand towards Trafalgar Square, gently corralled by police. But then a group managed to break through, and at a quick march headed through the back streets of Leicester Square, around Piccadilly and then back to Trafalgar Square, where they picked up more protesters and headed for Downing Street to shout at the police and their dogs there. Then it was over to Trafalgar Square, to watch these two lads do what they seem to do best. Show off. So here we all are in Trafalgar Square, around 1,500 of us, milling around the area of London police have more experience policing than any other. There's been no violence that I have seen, and only a few arrests. The breakaway groups enjoyed the freedom and empowerment owning the streets for a while brought them, which is how it should be. Police helicopters continue to circle overhead, and in past May Days it is only when the police and protesters get really tired of each other that violence breaks out. We're not there yet, and I'm not sure it is on the agenda this time round. Being honest, I'm disappointed with the turn-out. Maybe Inspector Trotter was right after all, and the weather kept people away. Maybe it was laziness, or maybe May Day has gone out of fashion for direct activists - if so, I stand corrected, but hope they will turn their attention and power to September's arms fair at London Docklands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
