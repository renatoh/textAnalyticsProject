I studied their joyous, earnest expressions. I took in how genuinely happy and safe they looked in their whimsy. \u201cYou joyful fools,\u201d I thought. \u201cYour vigour for life appals me.\u201d Last year, my social anxiety was sky-high and my insomnia the worst it had ever been. Exhausted, I said no to every social invitation, but the more I stayed in, the more scared I became of going out. Work was stressful and adulthood felt so goal-oriented: work longer, run faster, cycle further, vegan harder. I tried meditating, but my mind wouldn\u2019t stay still. Exercise felt like a slog. I tried colouring books, but they didn\u2019t work. I have extreme stage fright and I am an introvert, but I was fed up with my grey life and outlook and wanted to try something radically different. I signed up for an eight-week improv course \u2013 structured but spontaneous play with total strangers. I grabbed my coat and said my prayers. On the first day, my instructor, Liam, told the class: \u201cImprov is not about being funny. It\u2019s not about being clever. Or quick.\u201d Sorry, what? \u201cIt\u2019s about being open and in the moment. Saying yes to suggestions. And going with whatever your scene partner offers you.\u201d Liam divided us into groups of four for a game called \u201cRemember when?\u201d Each group had to create a story. A guy named Clover began. The two others in my group were a tall man and a woman with blue hair. \u201cDo you remember the time we bought that jar of pickles?\u201d asked Clover. \u201cAnd it was the last jar in town,\u201d Tall Guy said. They turned to me. \u201cAnd \u2026 we buried it and swore we\u2019d never tell anyone about it,\u201d I blurted out. I wanted the story to be about secrets, broken loyalties and the apocalypse \u2013 when the pickle jar would save us. \u201cBut then we wanted a roast dinner,\u201d said Blue Hair Girl. \u201cAnd we wanted those pickles,\u201d said Tall Guy. \u201cNo, no, no. We kept them buried for 20 years, remember?\u201d I said. I came to the scene with a fully formed story in my mind and struggled to deviate. I did not want this to be about a roast dinner. Pickles don\u2019t even belong in a roast dinner. How could I work with these people? I knew performing would be scary, but relinquishing control was the mind-screw I had not anticipated. In another scene, I was paired with a woman named Maria. \u201cYou\u2019re in a garden centre!\u201d Liam said. I didn\u2019t know what to say and neither did Maria, who looked at me blankly. Then, \u201cLook at these shrubs!\u201d she yelled, pointing at a beanbag. \u201cVery green!\u201d I finally said. \u201cWhat do you think this shrub is doing?\u201d Maria asked. I froze. \u201cI think there\u2019s something wrong with this shrub,\u201d Maria added, her eyes pleading with me to join in. Spontaneous. Free-flowing. Yes, and \u2026? \u201cMa\u2019am, this shrub is PREGNANT!\u201d I shouted. Where had that come from? Free from my everyday boring self, I was discovering sides of my personality I had never known. I could feel my brain shifting as I became more creative, playful and animated. After safely delivering the shrub\u2019s baby (7lb 6oz, the mother is doing fine, thank you for asking), I began to realise that at improv you can\u2019t worry about work deadlines, breakups or money woes because you are constantly jumping from scene to scene. I was free from the agonising loop of being myself: introvert, anxious and shy. My anxiety evaporated in that room. My stage fright transformed into excitement, and I became dynamic, looser, more spontaneous. Happier. I had social anxiety, but in every scene, I leaped off a cliff into the unknown and my scene partners, virtual strangers, would catch me. After class, the world seemed kinder and more manageable because mistakes were so easily forgiven. My shyness slowly melted away. In one class, I laughed so hard that I cried, full-on shaking with laughter, as tears streamed down my face. My scene partner couldn\u2019t hold it together either, and the feeling came over me suddenly. Oh, no. My vigour for life appalled me. I now regularly try to make room for improv and play time in my life. It is a bright spot when I am feeling beaten down by the everyday. The three hours of laughter do wonders for my stress levels, and afterwards I sleep without a care. I love improv, which means I have to reckon with the most hideous thought: I might actually be a joyful, whimsical fool. However, I am far too busy playing a drunk scientist off the coast of Papua New Guinea to care. \u2022 Sorry I\u2019m Late, I Didn\u2019t Want to Come: An Introvert\u2019s Year of Living Dangerously by Jessica Pan (Doubleday) is \u00a312.99.
