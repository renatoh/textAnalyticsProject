The Lowy Institute poll shows that since 2011 faith in the US to act responsibly has fallen from 83% to 55%, while only 30% of Australians have confidence in Trump\u2019s foreign policy. \u201cThere is no question that Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has eroded Australians\u2019 trust and confidence in the United States as a responsible global actor,\u201d said the Lowy Institute\u2019s executive director, Michael Fullilove, adding: \u201cYet despite concerns about the current occupant of the White House, Australians\u2019 support for the US alliance has held firm.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Fully three-quarters (76%) of Australians say the US alliance is either \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cfairly\u201d important to Australia\u2019s security. The postwar global order has faced fundamental challenges over the past two years, Fullilove said, from the UK\u2019s vote for Brexit, to Trump\u2019s unconventional leadership, and China\u2019s economic rise and muscular regional policies. Domestically, for the first time in the 14-year history of the Lowy poll, a majority of Australians \u2013 54% \u2013 believe that immigration into the country is too high, up 14 points from 40% last year \u2013 perhaps reflecting widespread political debate about immigration settings, infrastructure in Australian cities and house prices. Concerns about climate change have increased and Australians\u2019 preference for renewable energy over coal has solidified. And nearly three-quarters (72%) of Australians (up from 56% in 2014) believe that the government is \u201callowing too much investment from China\u201d. Forty-six per cent believe it is \u201clikely that China will become a military threat to Australia in the next 20 years\u201d. Three-quarters of those respondents believe that conflict will be sparked by conflagration with the US. There is a stark age divide in attitudes to China. Beijing\u2019s growing power does not alarm most Australians but a majority (52%) of those over 60 see the country as a critical threat to their nation\u2019s interests. More than eight in 10 Australians view China as \u201cmore of an economic partner\u201d than a \u201cmilitary threat\u201d. Australians, it seems, want the government to walk a careful diplomatic path with the world\u2019s established superpower and its emerging one. Eighty-one per cent of respondents say \u201cit is possible for Australia to have a good relationship with China and a good relationship with the United States at the same time\u201d. The Lowy Institute\u2019s research director and the author of the poll, Alex Oliver, said while Australia\u2019s fealty to the US alliance was a pragmatic one, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be complacent about it: it won\u2019t last forever.\u201d Australians\u2019 faith would be more fundamentally shaken if Trump \u2013 or a Trump-like president \u2013 were to win the next election. Oliver said the concerns about China were less about influence than they were about investment, pointing to concern about house prices. Australians\u2019 feelings of safety are at their lowest levels in the poll\u2019s history. In 2018 78% of respondents say they feel either \u201cvery safe\u201d or \u201csafe\u201d. In 2005 that figure was 91%. Terrorism and North Korea\u2019s nuclear program \u2013 the poll was conducted before this month\u2019s historic meeting between Trump and North Korea\u2019s supreme leader, Kim Jong-un \u2013 are viewed as the greatest threats to Australia. But Australia is seen as being in better shape than the rest of the world, with 46% of respondents saying they are satisfied with the way things are going in the country. But only 17% of respondents are \u201csatisfied with the way things are going in the world today\u201d, with 78% dissatisfied. The poll was conducted by phone and online by the Social Research Centre in March, surveying 1,200 adults. The margin of error is approximately 2.8%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
