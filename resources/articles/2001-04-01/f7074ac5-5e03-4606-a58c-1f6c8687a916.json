Low-cost stakeholder pensions, aimed at those without access to a pension scheme, went on sale two weeks ago but in the run-up to their arrival many life insurers were selling so-called pre-stakeholder pensions, offering broadly the same terms. CGNU, created by the merger of CGU and Norwich Union 11 months ago, said the figures showed it was well placed for a leading position in the stakeholder market. The group's shares gained 31p to 994p after it said worldwide new life and pensions sales in the three months to March 31 rose 23% to \u00a33.3bn. But jittery stock markets had caused a 46% drop in sales of investment products in the US, Australia and Canada. In the Netherlands, investment sales slumped to \u00a315m from \u00a3371m in the same period last year, reflecting \"extreme volatility in investment markets, which resulted in negative consumer sentiment to equity-backed products\". Britain fared a lot better, with sales of investment products such as Isas up 25% and record life sales achieved - up 22% to \u00a32.2bn. The group is likely to have picked up business in recent months as a result of Equitable Life's troubles. A spokesman said CGNU believed independent financial advisers and banks would be the main distribution channels for stakeholder pensions. \"We are the leading IFA provider and, together with our bancassurance relationship with the Royal Bank of Scotland, are well placed to achieve significant and profitable stakeholder sales,\" the company added. Chief executive Richard Harvey said: \"Despite volatile equity markets, which created difficult conditions for retail investment sales, our increased distribution capability produced record new business sales.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
