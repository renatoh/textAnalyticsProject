As a sport gathers to decide the host of its global championship, questions are raised about the favourite. The country\u2019s record on workers\u2019 rights is abysmal. Those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender risk prison. And the heat, which is so oppressive many avoid the sun \u2013 and suffer vitamin D deficiencies as a result \u2013 is uncomfortable for athletes and spectators alike. Yet in the end, money wins. It wins because vast amounts are spent on sporting venues, on infrastructure and the smoothest public-relations campaigns. And while there is a compelling story too \u2013 of new lands, audiences and opportunities \u2013 it would largely go unread without a metronomic pumpjack of oil money. Which brings us to the International Association of Athletics Federations\u2019 vote for the 2019 world championships in Monaco on Tuesday lunchtime. Three cities \u2013 Doha, Eugene and Barcelona \u2013 are in contention but the Qatari bid is considered the strong front-runner. Of course it is. For Qatar accumulates sporting events like the Kremlin buys gold. Over the next year it will host world championships in squash, short-course swimming, handball, boxing and para-athletics as well as almost 40 other international sporting events. Then there is the 2022 World Cup, which looks likely to remain in situ after last week\u2019s whitewash. Hosting an athletics world championship would be another significant success. The IAAF reckons it is the third largest sporting event in the world, with an estimated TV audience of five billion viewers. And while such claims are best swallowed with a pinch of Persian Gulf salt, grabbing it would surely help Doha\u2019s case for hosting the biggest one of them all: the Olympics. We know from past experience \u2013 England 2018 anyone? \u2013 that determining the voting intentions of sport\u2019s big men is a murky business, but everyone I speak to believes Qatar is ahead on the IAAF\u2019s key criteria, which includes the bid\u2019s vision and general concept, accommodation, security, finance and \u2013 of course \u2013 legacy. Jason Henderson, the editor of Athletics Weekly, was present when the IAAF\u2019s evaluation committee visited Doha recently and described to me an \u201cAladdin\u2019s cave of hi-tech athletics equipment and stadia\u201d. The focus on using the championship to help Qatari youth become more active also apparently went down well. Meanwhile Henderson pointed out another difference between Doha and its rivals: its PR machine. While he was bombarded with press releases from the Qatari bid, representatives from Eugene and Barcelona could muster only one email between them. Away from the silky presentations and public-relations campaign, the high-wattage outrage regarding how Qatar treats migrant workers who build their shiny new stadiums refuses to dim. As first reported in the Guardian, hundreds of workers involved in the construction of World Cup 2022 facilities have died in workplace accidents or because of unexplained cardiac arrest \u2013 and there is little evidence those involved in building work for Doha 2019 will have it much better. Last week, Qatar\u2019s sports minister, Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser al-Ali, pledged to tackle the issue of workers\u2019 rights in the next few months. But labour reforms were also promised in May 2014 yet, according to a recent report from Human Rights Watch, \u201cthe announced reforms, for which there is no timetable nor draft legislation, will not adequately protect migrant workers from human trafficking, forced labour, and other rights violations\u201d. Workers still often have to surrender their passports, are sometimes not paid on time and are banned from joining unions. It is hardly reassuring either that in September two British researchers documenting the problems faced by migrant workers were held for 10 days before being released without charge. Given that the Qatari authorities claim the athletes\u2019 village for Doha 2019 will be built regardless of what happens in Monaco, the IAAF\u2019s power to stick up for workers\u2019 rights is probably limited. But imagine the credit they would get if they found the backbone to insist on certain minimum standards if Qatar got the bid? It is not as if the IAAF does not have choices. Barcelona is one of the world\u2019s great cities, with excellent facilities and a stunning stadium. Eugene, meanwhile, is the sentimental underdog \u2013 a small city of 157,000 which has been labelled as Track Town USA because of its deep affection for track and field. Qatar has made much of the fact it would host the first athletics world championship in the Gulf but the United States, the most successful athletics nation by far, has never staged an outdoor world championships either. When I visited the decathlon world record holder, Ashton Eaton, in his home in Eugene last year, he spoke enthusiastically about what it might do to the sport in the United States.\u201cLet me put it this way,\u201d he added wryly. \u201cWhen you are at the bottom the only way is up.\u201d Yet Doha remains the overwhelming favourite. In an era where large sporting events are no longer cash cows but cash-sucking leeches, you can understand why. Qatar is happy to spend, spend and spend again: the prestige of hosting of a major sporting event mattering far more than any potential profit. Even so, wouldn\u2019t it be refreshing if morality \u2013 as well as money and legacy \u2013 played a part in the IAAF\u2019s decision-making on Tuesday?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
