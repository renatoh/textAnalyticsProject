On Tuesday night Northern Territory police arrested the suspected shooter on a Darwin city street. He remains under police guard in a Darwin hospital, with police expected to lay charges on Wednesday. On Wednesday the NT police commissioner Reece Kershaw said the man, who was released from jail on parole in January and was wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet at the time of the shooting and was \u201cwell known to us\u201d. The first reports of a man firing shots came at the Palms Motel just outside the Darwin city centre about 5.50pm. A man was killed at the motel before three other deaths occurred at the nearby Buff Club, Gardens Hill Crescent and an industrial site at Jolly Street in the suburb of Woolner. Witness Leah Potter told the Today Show she had followed a police officer to the scene of the shooting at the motel. \u201cWe followed him, and the scene that we came across, I could not even believe that this could happen in Darwin,\u201d she said. \u201cA man had come through the Palms Motel and shot every window.\u201d She said the man was looking for someone, and after shooting up the motel he allegedly found his target and shot him dead. Potter said the man was well known. \u201cHe\u2019s a local Darwin lad that all of us know. So it\u2019s quite shocking,\u201d she said. Kershaw confirmed that the suspect had been wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet at the time. A shotgun was used but its exact type is not yet known. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to establish the intent and the motivation behind this,\u201d Kershaw told reporters. He said the shooting was not terrorism-related. Asked if the man was a member of the Rebels motorcycle gang, Kershaw said he may have associated with them. Kershaw said the man may have been trying to hand himself in to police and urged members of the public who had information or video footage to contact the force. Witnesses told the ABC that the man had walked into the Palms Motel and opened fire with a pump-action shotgun just before 6pm on Tuesday. A group of about a dozen men who were friends and relatives of a man who died at the motel gathered outside after the shooting, many in tears. Matthew James was standing in a car park nears the Palms when it all began. \u201cIt was just surreal,\u201d he told Nine\u2019s Today program on Wednesday. \u201cAll of a sudden there were these gunshots. \u201cMoments later someone came running towards me carrying this woman who was covered in blood and just basically put her at my feet and she was screaming that she had been shot. \u201cThe guy that actually carried her up was pretty frantic at the time, saying he had opened the door and there was a gunman there with a shotgun and he proceeded to fire upon anybody inside the building.\u201d James said the woman was hysterical. \u201cShe was caught up in it, she said, \u2018I\u2019ve been shot, I don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t have anything to do with anything.\u2019 The woman told James the shooter had been going from room to room, firing his gun and shouting the name of a man \u2013 Alex. \u201cIt just seems so insane,\u201d James said. Chris Dalgleish, who was having a beer on the balcony of the Frontier Hotel pub across the road from the Palms, said people had raced inside when they realised someone was shooting. \u201cEveryone started jumping inside, then locking doors and windows and went to the back corner,\u201d he told Australian Associated Press. John Rose told the ABC he had seen a gunman walk into the motel with \u201ca sawn-off shotgun\u201d. \u201cHe shot up all the rooms and he went to every room looking for somebody and he shot them all up. Then we saw him rush out, jump into his Toyota pick-up, and rush off.\u201d He said the gunman had appeared calm. \u201cOnce he left we went in and found one gentleman, he\u2019s over there, we pulled him out,\u201d Rose said. Leah Potter said the gunman had been armed with a pump-action shotgun and had shot a woman through her hotel room door. \u201cI was in the car park [of a neighbouring hotel] when I heard what I thought were fireworks going off, really loud cracking, banging fireworks,\u201d she told the ABC. \u201cThis lady turned up and started screaming, and we didn\u2019t realise there was another person in there \u2026 apparently he\u2019s dead, he\u2019s been shot.\u201d The NT chief minister, Michael Gunner, said thoughts were with the families and friends of the victims. \u201cThis is not the Darwin we know,\u201d he told reporters. A police duty superintendent, Lee Morgan, told the Guardian shortly after the shooting there were \u201cfour deceased and a number of other people who have been shot\u201d. Morgan said police had first received calls about shots being fired at 5.50pm local time. The alleged gunman was finally arrested by NT police without incident at 6.45pm at the busy Stuart Highway and McMinn Street intersection. Officers expect to lay charges against him on Wednesday. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has been in touch with the Northern Territory chief minister. \u201cThis is a terrible act of violence,\u201d he told reporters in London. \u201cI just want to extend my deep condolences and sympathies to all the people in the territory, particularly in Darwin. This is a very tight community and I know they will be rocked by these events.\u201d A Royal Darwin hospital spokeswoman, Sally Edwards, said the emergency department was treating a woman with leg wounds who was in a stable condition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
