Indeed, in yesterday's first-round victory over Julia Vakulenko, the 21-year-old Belgian looked more like she was preparing to fight Lennox Lewis than face up to the challenge of the Williams sisters. Henin's heavily bandaged hand, injured in the Rosmalen final against her compatriot Kim Clijsters last Saturday, seemed more in keeping with a boxing ring than a tennis court. Even though the No3 seed took a few hits in capturing the first set 7-5, the second saw her land a knockout blow on her Ukrainian opponent, as she took the match 6-1. \"I'm pretty happy first just that I can play. The second issue is that I won,\" said Henin. \"My injury is still bothering me. It's painful, but when I'm focused I can forget it a little bit more.\" Henin, who defeated the champion, Serena Williams, in the semi-finals at Roland Garros last month, was asked if she, as a smaller player - she is just under 5ft 6in - would prefer if the game had not moved towards the bigger, more powerful players. \"I think it's great like it is,\" said Henin. \"I think it's good to have different kinds of games and different kinds of personalities in the top 10. Tall girls, girls like me, I think it's great to have these differences.\" Jennifer Capriati, three inches taller and twice a semi-finalist here, began her 10th attempt at the title with an easy win over Myriam Casanova of Switzerland, the 27-year-old No8 seed from the United States going through 6-1, 6-3 in just over an hour. She, too, had the Williams sisters in her sights. \"I had a great run the last two years,\" said Capriati. \"I mean, winning three grand slams and coming closer to the Williamses than anybody.\" Mary Pierce is one of those floundering in the wake. She was champion at Roland Garros in 2000, but a series of injuries has seen her slip to 83rd in the world. Yesterday, however, she served notice that she is far from completely clapped out with an emphatic 6-0, 6-0 win over Ansley Cargill of the United States, who managed just 16 points in the 37-minute match. Alexandra Stevenson, the 26th seeded American, was a semi-finalist on her debut at Wimbledon in 1999, but has struggled to recover that form and she made her exit as Emilie Loit of France spirited away the second set tie-break to take the match 7-5, 7-6. Two other women seeds bit the dust: Meghann Shaughnessy of the United States, the 19th seed, who lost 6-3, 6-2 to the 203rd ranked Hungarian qualifier Aniko Kapros; and the No32 seed Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand, who succumbed to the Japanese Akiko Morigami."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
