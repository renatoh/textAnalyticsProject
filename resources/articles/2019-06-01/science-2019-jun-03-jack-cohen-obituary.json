He also co-authored popular science books and science fiction, and designed alien creatures and ecosystems for science fiction writers. But he will be best remembered for the bestselling four-book series The Science of Discworld, which he wrote with Terry Pratchett and me. I first met Jack in 1990, when he phoned me at Warwick University. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Jack Cohen. I have a question about your book on chaos theory. Can we meet?\u201d We had lunch at a pub in Kenilworth, and four hours later we were still there, having discovered that a mathematician and a biologist could have far more in common than they expected. We became close friends and collaborators, writing three popular science books together: The Collapse of Chaos (1994), based on four years of pub conversations, Figments of Reality (1997) and What Does a Martian Look Like? (2002). We wrote two science fiction novels: Wheelers (2000), whose complex plot we invented during a long car journey to appear on a scientific game show on BBC radio, and a sequel, Heaven (2004). We also collaborated on scientific papers: mathematical models of evolution, the supposed decline of the human sperm count, and an article on alien life for a Nature astrobiology supplement. The culmination of these activities was, for us both, the Discworld books. Jack and Terry had been friends since Terry was a struggling young journalist, brought together by a common love of science fiction. After Terry became famous for his humorous fantasy books, he would often phone Jack to discuss biological curiosities. Jack introduced me to Terry at the Birmingham Science Fiction Group\u2019s annual SF convention Novacon in 1990. At another convention we ended up at a Mongolian restaurant near Dudley. The conversation turned to books \u201cexplaining\u201d the alleged real science behind TV series such as Star Trek, and we wondered about doing the same for Discworld. We agreed that it would make good use of Terry\u2019s much-loved stories of wizards and witches and trolls and vampires to explain some real science to a general readership. But Terry foresaw a problem. \u201cThere\u2019s no science in Discworld. It runs on magic. Dragons don\u2019t breathe fire because they swallow combustible material. They breathe fire because that\u2019s what dragons do.\u201d Six months later, we figured it out: \u201cTerry: if there\u2019s no science in Discworld, can you put some there?\u201d The wizards of Unseen University, we suggested, should bring into being the Roundworld Project, a magical force field the size of a football that contains the whole of the real universe. It keeps magic out, so inside it, everything runs on scientific rules. The wizards would be puzzled by the weird ways that rules work, such as round worlds with something called \u201cgravity\u201d to stop people falling off the bottom, instead of sensible flat worlds like the Disc. The science chapters would be about real science in this universe, narratively embedded in Discworld. Terry could write a Discworld short story, with hooks on which Jack and I could hang the science, intercut with the story like \u201cvery big footnotes\u201d. It worked like a charm. The Science of Discworld was published in 1999, with three further books following in 2002, 2005 and 2013. The series sold more than a million copies and changed our lives; Jack considered it one of his proudest achievements. He and I became regulars at Discworld conventions. Occasionally we joined Terry on one of his marathon book signings \u2014 five hours, typically. Jack was born in Norwich, into a Jewish family, and grew up in Stoke Newington, north London. His father, David, was killed in 1945 when a ship carrying explosives blew up. His mother, Lilian (nee Jacobs), was a seamstress and ran a children\u2019s clothing factory. Jack was educated at Central Foundation boys\u2019 school. In his early teens, he bred tropical fish and cycled all over London with a glass tank strapped to his bicycle, selling the fish to aquarium shops. He considered training as a rabbi, but read Spinoza and became an atheist. He studied for a zoology degree at Hull University, funded by the profits from his fish trade, obtaining a BSc in 1954 and a PhD on feathers in 1957, which led to research on how rats\u2019 whiskers grow. In 1959 he was appointed lecturer in zoology and comparative physiology at Birmingham University. After a year at Harvard Medical School he returned to Birmingham, later leaving academic life, in 1987, to work as a consultant to IVF clinics. Science fiction was a lifelong passion. When his head of department was looking for people to lecture to schools, he noticed a copy of an SF magazine on Jack\u2019s desk, and wrote on the lecture list \u201cWhat does a Martian look like?\u201d Jack gave the talk more than 300 times. He acted as a consultant to leading SF writers, helping them to design scientifically plausible aliens and scenarios for novels. He provided scientific underpinnings for Anne McCaffrey\u2019s Dragonriders series, including explaining how the Red Star could \u201cbe at zenith\u201d in two different directions at once, and worked with Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle and Steven Barnes on alien ecologies for their Heorot series. With help from Jack, Warwick University awarded Terry his first honorary degree in 1999. Before the ceremony, Terry made Jack and me honorary wizards of Unseen University, an event reported in Nature. More conventionally, Jack was made an honorary professor in the mathematics department at Warwick in 2000. Jack was always friendly and open, though he could bite when necessary. He preferred informality, but wore a spectacular waistcoat for special occasions. He enjoyed music, especially opera. He set up tropical and marine fish tanks, kept snakes, and designed ecologically sound lakes. When I needed a media-friendly tiger for the BBC Christmas Lectures in 1997, it was Jack who spent six months chasing up contacts to locate one. He had an enormous circle of friends, colleagues and former students, and was final year tutor to the Nobel prizewinner Sir Paul Nurse, who remembered him as an \u201cinspirational teacher: highly knowledgable about animals, intelligent, stimulating, challenging, eccentric, an enthusiast who thought out of the box, not infrequently wrong but always in an interesting way.\u201d He was married, and divorced, three times: first to Carmela Mia Dawidowicz, with whom he had two children, David and Rebecca; second to Judith Evans, with whom he had four children, Daniel, Tabitha, Beth and Felix; and then to Carol Irving. He is survived by his partner, Persephone Arbour, and by his children. \u2022 Jack Sidney Cohen, biologist and writer, born 19 September 1933; died 6 May 2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
