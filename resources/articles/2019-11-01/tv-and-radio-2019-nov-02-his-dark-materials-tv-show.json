How many times will I have to watch a special child central to the mystic storyline run lightly across the high walls of an olde building? How many times will I have to watch another child, their friend (not special), gasp \u201cWait for me!\u201d as they pace off into the distance? How many times will the matron of the house grab the special one by the ear and say: \u201cYou know you shouldn\u2019t be out here, miss, racing around like that! G\u2019worn now!\u201d? How many times will I have to watch two old men in scholars\u2019 uniforms meet secretly by a fireside and say: \u201cThe girl \u2026 she is not long for this place\u201d? How! Many! Times! Will! I! Have! To! Watch! A! Bad! Guy! Converse! With! A! Snake! How many fantastical airships will I have to watch take off from perfectly trimmed, green and lustrous lawns? How many MacGuffins will I have to watch be handed with holy sanctity to a child before they go on their \u201cjourney\u201d? \u201cCareful, Lyra,\u201d the scholars may as well be saying, \u201cfor the MacGuffin is vital, and made of bronze. Nerds on Reddit will be talking about the importance of this for, like, the next five years.\u201d How many times do I have to watch a child be warned: \u201cDon\u2019t go in there, dear: for it is my forbidden room\u201d \u2013 then watch the child walk straight into the forbidden room and find a secret almost immediately? How many times do I have to watch a rough-and-tough character storm around in the mud and snow and ice and then, on their return to the warm embrace of humanity, be saluted and addressed as \u201cLord\u201d? How many two-minute intro sequences where stirring orchestra-and-choir music plays while swish CGI graphics construct either a clock or a horse out of atoms will I have to sit through before the abyss embraces me? How many arcane-symbol bad guys will I have to watch talk in plotting whispers as they look ominously off over a high balcony? How many times will I flinch when everyone in the show says \u201cma\u201d instead of \u201cmum\u201d in forced, rough, drama-school working-class accents? How many times, crucially, will I have to listen to a boring man with a thin, lank ponytail tell me at length at a party that, actually, the books were better, and, actually, a very crucial scene from the second book has been omitted, and that\u2019s why the thing with the dragon doesn\u2019t make sense? Anyway, we\u2019re in an era now \u2013 and you know what I mean: post-Game of Thrones \u2013 where fantasy is now all right, and the adult figurine market booms. This latest BBC effort is lavish, A-list, beautiful, drawn from immensely popular and perfectly mystery\u2013adventure-dense source material (in this case Philip Pullman\u2019s hit novel series), and they\u2019ve got James McAvoy in as the glue. They have \u2013 apart from a small segment in the first episode where someone shouts: \u201cNO! THE GOBBLERS ARE REAL!\u201d \u2013 got everything right. So in answer to the question of how many more of these I\u2019m going to watch entirely through before death, the answer is: at least one more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
