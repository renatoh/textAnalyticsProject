Other social workers report that the coronavirus crisis has reduced their contact with at-risk children to a WhatsApp call, or being shown them at a safe distance on the doorstep by parents who say they are self-isolating or are anxious about infection. It\u2019s a deeply unsatisfactory state of affairs that is alarming social workers across the country. \u201cThere are four families on my books \u2013 10 children in all \u2013 where, however hard I try, I really can\u2019t know that the children are safe,\u201d says Kirsty, a senior practitioner with a council in the Midlands. \u201cIf it all goes Pete Tong, who is going to be accountable?\u201d Face-to-face contact is integral to social workers\u2019 practice. The coronavirus lockdown has left children and families specialists, as well as those working with vulnerable adults, without any national rules or advice on how to adapt their approach to ensure even minimal safeguards when contact is limited. \u201cThe fundamental problem is that there is no public health guidance for social work,\u201d says Ruth Allen, chief executive of the British Association of Social Workers (BASW). \u201cThere\u2019s also a concern that this situation may enable some families to put up barriers. But it\u2019s the social worker\u2019s job to overcome those barriers.\u201d Kate\u2019s authority is still requiring her and her \u2018front-door\u2019 colleagues to make visits to follow-up referrals, even though other services such as family support have stopped. \u201cFamilies don\u2019t want us visiting because they are worried about us going from household to household [and carrying infection],\u201d she says. \u201cI appreciate that. But when you end up trying to do an assessment in the garden, I just feel like I\u2019m not doing my job and may be leaving the child at risk \u2013 and putting my registration at risk.\u201d Charlie does the same job as Kate with a council in the Midlands. She is currently self-isolating and assessment visits are being undertaken by two colleagues. Their managers have stipulated that, for the time being, no visit should exceed 15 minutes. \u201cThat makes it very difficult to assess what\u2019s going on, assess relationships and assess risk,\u201d says Charlie, 30. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get a bit more creative and tech-savvy with WhatsApp and FaceTime, doing what we can to still have a conversation, but it doesn\u2019t sit right. It\u2019s not a good time to be a social worker.\u201d For Kirsty, who is part of a post-referral child safeguarding team, schools would normally offer an alternative location for a visit and there would be time, in a private space, to draw out a child through games, toys or drawing. But relatively few at-risk children are still being sent to school, even though they remain eligible to attend. Only one of Kirsty\u2019s caseload of 21 children is still going. \u201cThe school are marvellous: they scrub down, sterilise and deep-clean every time I\u2019m there,\u201d says Kirsty, 47, contrasting the precautions with those of her own employer who, she reports, has issued her with a flask for water, a bar of soap and paper towels so she can wash her hands between visits. Some of her deepest concerns are reserved for children and teenagers in households marked out for domestic abuse and drug and alcohol misuse, that have now declared themselves off-limits for visiting. \u201cI have a family with a 17-year-old who has a boyfriend who abuses her, a younger sister of 15 and a mother who has mental health issues she doesn\u2019t acknowledge,\u201d says Kirsty. \u201cHow am I supposed to know if the boyfriend is there? How am I supposed to ensure those children are safe?\u201d Allen says the BASW is urgently drawing up guidance on home visiting, which it hopes to publish in the next few days and which will stress the imperative to keep contact to an essential minimum while observing basic health precautions. But it is vital that social workers like Kate, Charlie and Kirsty, working alone, feel they are not carrying sole responsibility for any gaps in the system during the current emergency, Allen says. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that organisations create virtual teams to maintain relationships. That\u2019s quite possible to do. Managers and supervisors are operating under tremendous strain \u2013 everyone is \u2013 but they need to ensure that their social workers still have team support.\u201d * All social workers\u2019 names have been changed"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
