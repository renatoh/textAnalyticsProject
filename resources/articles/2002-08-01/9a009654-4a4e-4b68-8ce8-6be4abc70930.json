He shanked. A shank results in the ball flying uncontrollably sideways, and in this instance it finished in a lake. For a 23-year-old playing in only his fourth European Tour event it should have been the end. As he himself said yesterday: \"Psychologically it's the most destructive shot in golf.\" But it failed to destroy McDowell, who went on to win the tournament and mark himself down as yet another magnificent talent emerging on the European Tour. In only a couple of months he has overtaken the much heralded trio of Walker Cup players who turned professional before he did - Luke Donald, Paul Casey and Nick Dougherty - and he is quickly closing the gap on Justin Rose, who has been a professional for four years. To be able to win such a strong event so soon is commendable; to do it after a shank hugely creditable. \"I was only 10 yards from the pin,\" the Northern Irishman said of his recovery, \"and the shot I hit was almost perfect. \"They say a shank is like that. I used to be quite prone to it but somehow it has never affected me like it does some people. I've always been able to pull myself together. This time I birdied the next hole, which was very pleasing.\" By going on to victory he brings to mind the likes of Sandy Lyle, who won his first professional event - albeit only the Nigerian Open - and Jose Maria Olazabal, who won twice during his rookie season. Ben Crenshaw, too, won first time out and Phil Mickelson and Scott Verplank, of course, won as amateurs on the US Tour. The win does rather more for McDowell than add \u00a3200,000 to his bank account and give him a precious exemption from qualifying for two years. It makes him eligible for the NEC World Golf Championship in Seattle in three weeks and he has been invited to play in the Air Canada US Tour event in British Columbia the following week. That means he will be playing for a total of \u00a36.5m in those two weeks against what was the probable alternative, the Challenge Tour, which is offering a total of \u00a3330,000 in the same period. His life, quite literally, has been transformed and the amazing thing is that it almost did not happen. The week before the Scandinavian Masters McDowell did not have a place in the event and he and his management were thinking that he should go to Finland for the Challenge Tour event there. They were also thinking that he might do better to concentrate on that tour and try to get into the top 15 who qualify for the main tour each year. But a last-minute invitation from the owner of Kungsangen got him into the Swedish event. And then his team had to consider where he should play this week. Although he could get into the Wales Open, might it not be better to go to the Challenge Tour's Russian Open and attempt to get into that precious top 15? The decision had to be made by Thursday of last week in order that visas could be sorted out. But the problem resolved itself when McDowell opened with a 64 in Sweden and followed with rounds of 73, 66 and 67 to win by one shot from the South African Trevor Immelman. If he was capable of that, the team reasoned, he would be better off on the big tour. McDowell's win is not a complete surprise. Peter McEvoy, his captain in the 2001 Walker Cup team, had him as well as Dougherty and Donald in mind when he said after that match that there were \"three or four players who will be winning tournaments and playing in the Ryder Cup sooner rather than later\". The arrival of these talented young players at the same time is somewhat similar to the happy accident when Lyle, Nick Faldo, Bernhard Langer, Seve Ballesteros and Ian Woosnam burst on to the European scene at almost the same time. McDowell was also the best amateur in the US during his final year at the University of Birmingham in Alabama. He won the Fred Haskins Award given annually to the top-ranked player - an honour awarded in the recent past to Tiger Woods and Mickelson. And he has another link to some of the greats of the game. He uses the interlocking grip, not the more popular Vardon grip. \"I don't know why,\" he said yesterday. But then, with the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Woods, Colin Montgomerie and Sergio Garcia all doing likewise, he doesn't have to. Four more young lions destined to go far Paul Casey, 25.
