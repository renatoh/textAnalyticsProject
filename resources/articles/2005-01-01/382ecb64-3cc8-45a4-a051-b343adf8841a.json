The trees around it, so old that they have to be propped up, are overlooked by mullioned windows probably older still. It's easy to see why there's a film unit parked outside; these buildings are shorthand for centuries of privilege, rule of law, power. They are also, at the moment, the location of a burgeoning constitutional crisis. When the law lords ruled in December that indefinite detention, without trial, of foreign nationals under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 was a breach of their human rights, and thus illegal, Charles Clarke, then home secretary for all of a day, responded that he would be seeking parliamentary permission to renew the emergency provisions. Ian Macdonald QC, a special advocate for the dozen or so men affected, resigned in disgust. This week, his colleague Rick Scannell walked too. He was in Hong Kong when the law lords published their decision, \"and I wasn't keeping a close eye on what was going on in the UK\". In fact, he found out about it from his mother, who had emailed him about David Blunkett's resignation - \"I think she realised that might be of some interest,\" he says, eyebrows arching with knowing understatement - \"so I had a look at the decision on the website.\" \"I thought it was excellent. I had a lot of sympathy with Lord Hoffman's view that, 'The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws like these'\"; that the new emergency anti-terror measures were more of a threat to Britain than perhaps anything al- Qaida could do. It was immigration that brought Scannell to the bar. Although he studied law at university, his initial conclusion was that he wanted nothing to do with it: he defected to politics, working as a speechwriter for Betty Boothroyd when she was in the shadow cabinet, and for Greville Janner, MP for Leicester West, whose constituents had many immigration problems. Then, when a counsellor at the UK immigrants advisory service went on sabbatical, Scannell took over her caseload, and \"found I really enjoyed advocacy\". At bar school he met his wife, Sona Osman, who practices family law and some immigration just across the way; they have 14-year-old twins, Liam and Vida. He used to be an acrobat on the flying trapeze, and Vida has followed his trail through the air. \"I catch her\". He has fought some high-profile cases, but says it's the people that stick - the Kurdish asylum seeker who bounced from appeal to appeal for more than 10 years, ultimately losing his case at the House of Lords, or the Sierra Leonean woman who had suffered \"unspeakable violence\", including deliberate blinding. \"Sometimes when you represent people you feel an incredible personal frustration that they even have to be there.\" To get as far as court they have to have been refused, \"and you just think, 'How can someone like that berefused? How?'\" Scannell gets very cross about the political machinations that cause these situations - the periodic well-trumpeted clampdowns, the craven middle England-vote-chasing - though \"you begin to understand why the decision-makers\" [I think he means the beleaguered operatives in the Home Office] \"make bad decisions.\" The job of a special advocate, since 9/11, has been to represent people suspected of being linked to international terrorism. This is done in closed, secret sessions, with no jury (though there's never a jury in immigration cases). What makes the advocates \"special\" is that they are given top-level security clearance. Only they and the government - not the accused, and not their solicitors, with whom the advocates can consult until they receive \"closed evidence\" - know the exact details of the allegations. It is a fairly new institution, with obvious unfairnesses and difficulties - including the fact that \"it's lonely. The moment the shutters have come down the only person you can talk to is your junior.\" But Scannell, who has been a special advocate since 1998, stresses it isn't the institution per se he objects to: after all you don't want \"to give somebody who's said to be a risk to national security a full-blown account based on all the sensitive material\" - just the uses to which it has increasingly been put since 9/11, and the abuses for which he is a fig leaf. Last February the Home Office suggested that anti-terror laws might be extended to allow the introduction of criminal trials conducted in secret with a non-criminal standard of proof. Scannell and four other special advocates, including Ian Macdonald, reacted with horror. They wrote, in an open letter to the press, that the extension would, \"contradict three of the cardinal principles of criminal justice: a public trial by an impartial judge and jury of one's peers; proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt; and a right to know, comment on and respond to the case made against the accused. The special advocate system is utterly incapable of replacing these essential fundamentals of a fair trial.\" As it stands, the men currently in custody aren't even getting criminal trials - where reasonable suspicion leads to a defined process and end. \"What is so odious\" - Scannell leans forward, intensely, - is that this is \"worse than the end-stage of even the most heinous crime and detention, because it's indefinite.\" There is no possibility of parole. \"What is it that the government were saying about Guant\u00e1namo Bay last week?\" asks Scannell heatedly. \"The objection was that these are British citizens facing indefinite detention without trial. There are obviously other things involved, of course; there have been no suggestions of torture here ...\" But doesn't the treatment of Belmarsh detainees amount to psychological torture? I ask. He hesitates only slightly. \"I ... I ... I would indeed accept that. If you suffer acute physical and mental suffering - and I underline mental in the context of the psychological effect of indefinite detention, and indeed the fact that at least two of them are in Broadmoor - then yes, I would agree with you. You may well have a very powerful argument that begins to look like a breach in itself of article 3. It's Britain's Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\" Until Monday, Scannell represented the interests of three of the \"Belmarsh detainees\" - though in fact two of them are no longer in Belmarsh or Woodhill or Broadmoor - at all: they have left the country, for France and one other country (Scannell can't say). Which highlights another thing he can't stomach. It's often claimed that Britain is not abusing any human rights, the detainees are free to go. Well, only insofar as they have a choice of going back to a country that might torture them, or applying for visas elsewhere, inevitably getting turned down (the one in France was lucky - he had dual nationality; he's also free, because France, like the rest of Europe, does not detain people without charge). Moreover, British citizens accused of the same crimes get nothing like the same treatment: they are processed properly, through the criminal justice system. So the law lords' decision - and Clarke's \"slightly intemperate\" reaction to it - brought everything to a head. Scannell didn't react immediately, because he was away, and getting everything secondhand; then, in January, he heard Tony Blair on the Today programme. \"He was pretty strident. He wasn't asked, specifically, 'Are you going to release these men?', I don't think, but it was an interview in which I was left with the overriding impression that you're [Blair] not going to respond to this House of Lords decision by simply releasing these men.\" Scannell looked at his office diary and saw that detention hearings were still scheduled for late January and early February, and made up his mind. He waited only to consult with human rights group Liberty about timing before tendering his resignation to the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith. But how about a report in this paper, a couple of days ago, that the government intends to announce changes next week? Or reports that on February 8 the home secretary is to appear before the foreign affairs select committee to justify the laws? Couldn't Scannell have waited? \"They've had a month. It should not take that long where people's fundamental rights and liberties are concerned! Forget the European convention on human rights. The right to habeas corpus goes back to 1215 and the Magna Carta.\" But surely if you are one of only 15 or so people in the country who know the detailed allegations against the detainees, there is now one less person on their side? \"It's a fair question. It's something that I struggled with, as a matter of conscience, but it didn't win the day. I just felt now was the time to come out.\" His junior will be taking over from him, in the upcoming detention hearings at least. \"I've found it very very difficult, actually. But I am pleased that I've done it. I feel quite liberated.\" Did you hope to achieve anything else? Yes, he says. That \"in some small way, it might help persuade the government to release the men and, if appropriate, detain them as persons charged with criminal offences rather than have them remain facing indefinite detention without trial. It's draconian and unecessary.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
