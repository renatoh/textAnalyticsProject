Was DJ-ing in Tenerife. It was the first time I'd been to one of those English-invaded resorts. It was like Blackpool, but with Spanish sunshine and police. I sneaked off to an old town up in the hills and I really liked it, it was so unspoilt. I've got into the habit of doing that, exploring. When I'm travelling I always miss... Newspapers. It's hard for me to chill out. I don't sleep for more than five hours and I need to keep up with what's going on. I'll never go back to... Naples. I love Italy, but I just didn't like the attitude in Naples. But if you travel a lot that's going to happen occasionally. I never travel without... My mobile. I need to be in touch with my assistant and office and producers at Radio 1. A week away is a long time in my business, so I've always got to be on it. My top travel tip is... Be friendly. The great thing about travelling is that you can start again. If you've had a horrible week you can go abroad and pretend everything's different. My favourite hotel... Is the Half Moon Bay in Jamaica - I took the family and everybody loved it. The food was great, the facilities exactly right and the staff brilliant. Everything just fell into place. I'm a West Indian and I love West Indian food. The chef cooked traditional West Indian breakfast, lunch and dinner. I always bring back... Mosquito bites. They love me! I went to Namibia at the end of last year and for the first time felt I needed a memento and deliberately went to a market trader and bought a carved tribesman. I've decided I'm only going to bring things back if it's a really memorable place. The best beach I've ever seen was... In Rio de Janeiro. It was a public holiday, so Copacabana was heaving with Brazilians. Just to hang out there was great; Ipanema was a bit quieter, but still had a great vibe. The view was amazing... and I wasn't looking out to sea! I love the idea of... City breaks. My missus loves museums and going to art galleries. Recently I went to New York. I've been perhaps 20 times, but never really walked around properly. I went to a slavery exhibition and walked from Chinatown all the way uptown and saw parts that I'd never seen. I've always wanted to visit... Japan. It sounds like a completely insane place and the people are totally different to me. \u00b7 Trevor Nelson presents Soul Nation, Thursdays 1am-3am on Radio 1"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
