Even I can do the maths on this one. It's must-win for Arsenal tonight, what with them sitting flat on their arses scratching their heads like village idiots at the bottom of Group B. The good news is that Kiev travel about as well as something that doesn't travel well at all. A jelly with a fancy cream hat atop on the tube during rush hour, that kind of thing. The team news is that Arsenal are definitely missing Patrick Vieira (thigh, out till December) and Martin Keown (gorm deficiency, no known cure), while Dennis Bergkamp and Sylvain Wiltord are arguing over who's going to run around behind Thierry Henry to little effect tonight. Kiev are without defender Yuri Dmitrulin, who has a chest injury, and does anybody care that the referee is Lucilio Cardoso Cortez Batista of Portugal? Besides Mrs Cardoso Cortez Batista of Portugal, obviously. Team news as soon as it's confirmed, of that you can be sure. First and quite probably final email of the night \"I realise I am well ahead of the game here and not even going to read the commentary,\" writes a knife-twisting David Voss, \"but I am killing time in the office until my brother turns up, at which point we're off to the pub to watch the football. \"Which pretty much makes this a bit pointless, but I thought it'd be nice for you to have an email when you get in for your evening's 'work'. Have fun!\" Oh I will alright, Voss, for I have a tuna and egg baguette for my tea, plus a cup of Barry's Tea, a particularly flavoursome brew from the Emerald Isle. How could I not have fun? Team news, as you'd see it on the referee's team sheet Arsenal Lehmann Lauren Toure Campbell Cole Ljungberg Parlour Silva Pires Bergkamp Henry Subs: Stack Wiltord Edu Cygan Clichy Kanu Aliadiere Dynamo Kiev Shovkovskiy Fedorov Leko Nesmachnyi Gavrancic Ghioane Shatskikh Belkevich Peev Onyschenko Gusev Subs: Alessandro Melashchenko El Kaddouriv Rincon Nanni Sablic Reva 2 min: They're off, with Arsenal kicking left to right on my TV. \"It's called dinner, not tea,\" snorts snobbish Duncan McVerry. Not round my mock-Georgian it's not. Nothing much to report, merely two sides sizing each other up. 4 min: Ljungberg runs towards the D then falls like any Arsenal player worth his salt. Henry lines it up, just right of centre, and curls it three inches over with the keeper beaten. 6 min: A superb last-ditch tackle from Sol Campbell prevents Shatskikh a clear shot from three yards, as Kiev make slick progress down their left. Another good cross from the same flank skips dangerously across the face of goal and to safety. 9 min: Now Bergkamp slides a delicate pass into Ljungberg whose stretching shot is kicked away by the Kiev keeper who was going the wrong way. Lucky escape. I believe they'd call this end to end. 12 min: Bergkamp to Ljungberg again, this time with the Swede raiding down the right, and his cross skids dangerously across the face of goal with no Gunner to poke it home. \"Isn't Mr. Glendenning going to be pissed off that you drank his tea?\" asks Phil McTim, holding his sides and hooting loudly. \"Just kidding, I know all about Barry's. It's the best. Rather odd this, but you can buy in a chain of supermarkets in New Jersey. They don't stock any other kind of British/Irish tea, just Barry's. Also, like Guinness, it somehow tastes better in Ireland.\" 15 min: Nothing much to report here, bar knee-knack to some Kiev character. This email is marginally more exciting. \"I've a bet with my friend Michael as to when your computer 'crashes',\" writes Kevin Hession, as if he doesn't believe our technical troubles. \"I'm saying by the 15 minute mark at the latest. He says you'll be fine until the second half.\" 17 min: Pretty passing from Arsenal, but as yet no killer ball. And either someone in the Farringdon vicinity has bought fireworks, or some sleazy grass has just taken five in the chest down a back street. We're quite close to Kings Cross, so don't rule out the latter. 19 min: Kiev free-kick on the right touchline comes to nada. Neither does a Pires shot from 12 yards and an acute angle, it's weak and trundles into the goalkeeper's arms. 22 min: Onyshlenko injures himself chasing Bergkamp about the park, so hobbles off to be replaced by Sablic. From Bergkamp's right-wing free-kick, Silva heads straight into the keeper's arms, then said custodian knocks Henry over clearing a through ball. The pressure's building. Meanwhile... \"I don't understand your last email, which may have been part of a cunning disinformation campaign,\" writes John Fearon. \"The Barry's in New York taste's just fine, and if you feel like a change the 'certain' supermarket chain also carries Lyons, a nice respectable Dublin cup of tea. What doesn't travel well are the Tayto crisps.\" I'm starting to think maybe Barry would have been better discussing this, what with him wearing natty rose-tinted goggles tonight. 25 min: Two quick Arsenal corners, the first of which sees the Kiev keeper flap like Madchester flares in the wind. Alas, from Arsenal's perspective at least, there's no-one on hand to tuck it away. 27 min: This keeper's dodgy. Pires races to the right by-line in his white wellies and crosses, Shovkovskiy fumbles it into the side netting. Moments later, Gilberto Silva sees yellow for a minor misdemeanour. 34 min: Kevin Hession and his mate were both wrong, it cocked up on the 28-minute mark. Dribbling geek heads will roll, mark my words. The most notable incident you missed occurred just now, when Pires won a corner instead of a penalty after another piece of pantomime play acting. From the corner. Ljungberg heads over the keeper but it's cleared off the line. Right, Save, Launch, Crash. Here we go. 38 min: Leko picks up a yellow for clattering Silva, who winces and rolls on the turf for several minutes like a small child deprived of some sugar-based stick. Nothing much else happening here, unlike up in Scotland, where Celtic are three up on Anderlecht. 42 min: The most impressive move of the night sees the soon-to-be-'Doing-One' Danny Rookwood make for the kettle for another round of Barry's. Oh, and Pires bends one inches wide from 20 yards. Alas, no biscuits. 44 mins: Phil McTim's back. \"John Fearon sounds like a man who has never sampled Barry's Tea while in Ireland. I'm sure it's 'fine' in New York. It's 'fine' in New Jersey. But in Ireland, it's bloody fantastic. I'm sorry, but it is.\" As it is in Farringdon, as I believe should be clear by now. Half-time: 0-0 Much huff, much puff but little to write about, and I certainly wouldn't have written home about any of it. Arsenal were on top and slowly squeezing the pressure up, but they've struggled to find any real rhythm. They'll need to up the tempo in the second half. Trust me, I know my stuff. \"What a great night so far!\" beams Robbie Sweden. Or Robbie in Sweden. \"Celtic are three-up and it looks like there's is gonna be a fight anytime soon!! Elbow's are beginning to fly and I love it. That's what Arsenal need badly, someone who's not afraid to get involved... Barry's tea has rarely tasted this good!\" He must be following a different game. This is duff so far, and the milk was off so that's three Barry's bags wasted. From bad to worse. It's still half-time: But they're about to kick off again, but my attention's been snatched by an email entitled \"Tayto crisps my rosy red arse, Mr John Fearon\". It's from Mark Steeples, who claims \"Tayto crisps don't travel well because they don't set off well. They're about as nice as Hoppy Shipper's own-brand crisps. Is that libellous?\" Hoppy Shipper? Never heard of them so don't see how it can be. 46 mins: Early free-kick on the right for Kiev, free header from 12 yards which loops hopelessly and haplessly into the crowd. \"It's very simple,\" writes Duncan McDonnell. \"Barry's tea doesn't taste better in Ireland. It's just something tourists getting ripped off by my fellow countrymen in Dublin tell themselves. \"Do Kiwi fruits taste better in New Zealand? No.Coffee and pizzas here in Italy taste better but that's because they are made better. A teabag on the other hand is a teabag. No art involved.\" 49 mins: Sixty-yard ball, flick on from Henry, Bergkamp runs on and should score but fires against the keeper's legs and away to safety. Henry then skips through and flashes across the face of goal. Getting closer, as electro-beat collective Nitzer Ebb once sang. They probably didn't have this game in mind, though. 53 mins: Pires is starting to feature more for Arsenal, though as yet with no end product. A goal is what I mean, clearly. Ljungberg skies the best effort of note, and it's still floating over north London as we speak. \"If you think the tea's bad you should try being stuck at the office, on the pretence of working, drinking Nescafe, whilst listening to the sounds of fireworks/gunfire here in EC1.\" So writes Martin Stanley, grasping the wrong end of the caffeine stick. \"But oh to see the pain on Wenger's face as Arsenal penalty dive their way out of the Champion's League!\" 57 mins: Parlour slips a ball through to Henry but it's too strong. Then, at the other end, neat work down the right cuts Arsenal open and some Kiev player whose name I couldn't see crosses across the face of Lehmann's goal. They should have scored. \"Kiwi Fruits really do taste better in NZ since they developed the hairless kiwi fruit,\" announces Vivienne Kent. Bald fruit, clearly the way forward, then. 59 mins: Back and forth and back again. Pires scuffs a header wide when he should have scored, an open goal at his mercy. Then, straight down the other end and Belkevich misses an even easier open goal. It's only a matter or time, and Kiev have realised Arsenal aren't all that. 62 mins: Marked \"Short Straw\", Nigel Gomm's email reads simply \"Monaco 7 Deportivo 3\" And while he has a point, this is warming up nicely. Ray Parlour scuffs a decent chance into the turf and it's easily cleared. And on we go. 66 mins: Shatskikh shoots straight at Lehmann from 10 yards after a good turn. Then Martin Stanley made me laugh and miss the rest of the action with a joke I couldn't possibly use. This is the Guardian, Mr Stanley, though you wouldn't bet your hat on it. 69 mins: Arsenal are trying to pick pretty, intricate passes through this Kiev defence, a defence that's kept only two clear sheets in its last 32 European games, and so far it's just not working. Swapping Wiltord for Ljungberg is hardly going to help, but that's what they've just done. 73 mins: The clock is ticking. In truth it's been ticking from the start, that's how it works, but it's ticking in the sense that Arsenal are becoming increasingly desperate. Hence that last substitution. \"No art in a tea bag?\" growls the aptly-named Tim Madden. \"B******s! Clearly Duncan \"Dunkin'\" McDonnell, in spite of his name, has never done any tea-bagging or been tea-bagged! Not pure art, but a nice mix with science nonetheless.\" Would that be an off-shoot of dogging, Timothy? 76 mins: Toure in particular is getting desperate, so kicks out at an opponent and picks up a yellow card. Straight in front of Arsene, but he was looking at his shoe so probably didn't see it. Kanu's on for Romford tinker Ray Parlour. Last throw etc. 80 mins: Toure can't control a simple ball across the six-yard box, and another chance slips away. It's now 8-3 in Monaco. \"All this footballing talk is masking the real issues in the world. Like if you could have any part of a ducks anatomy attached to your own - which would it be and why?\" Who are you, Snarf Vodafone, and what do you really want? 83 mins: Henry chases back deep into his own half, such is Arsenal's panic. Kanu gets tugged in the area [no, this is the Guardian] but for some reason nobody in red bothers to appeal. I've a sense they may yet save themselves, but I've been wrong far more than I've been right. 86 mins: Sol Campbell concedes a cheap free-kick 20 yards inside his own half. Nothing comes of it, but it runs down a few more seconds. A sublime back-heel from Kanu plays in Toure for a shot eight yards out, only for a last-ditch tackle to deny him. It breaks free and Bergkamp's shot from the edge of the area is palmed over. Nothing develops from the corner, but replays suggest Toure's effort could have been a penalty. GOAL!!!!!!!! Ashley Cole header from three yards, the potty mouth throws himself in and diverts it past the keeper. Arsene saw that one alright, and turns out I was right for once. 91 mins: Edu for Bergkamp, wastes a bit of time. Ralph Roche would like to thank Cole for his sterling work tonight. \"You may have noticed that my e-mail address is arsenal@lsinter.net,\" he wrote just seconds before Cole struck. \"If we don't score in the next four minutes, I will change it to muppets'r'us@lsinter.net. GOAL!!!!!! A shot from fully 65 yards spills through Lehmann's hands and rolls agonisingly into the ne... Not really, they're still running the clock down. Full-time: Arsenal 1-0 Dynamo Kiev It wasn't pretty and it's going to take a far feistier performance than that to win in Milan, but Ashley Cole's goal keeps Arsenal alive in Group B. And if they think they'll win that big shiny cup come May playing like that, well they'd do well to think again. Still, all that matters at this moment in time is that Arsenal have picked up their first win in nine European games, and that my taxi home is waiting at the bottom of the stairs. Thanks for your emails and so on, you're the best. Really you are, every last one of you. Except you, Snarf, you're just weird."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
