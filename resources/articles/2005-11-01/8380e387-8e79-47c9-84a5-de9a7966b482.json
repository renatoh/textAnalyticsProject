Citing a tip about a firm called African Lakes, Mr Hipwell's barrister, Philip Hackett QC, said the journalist had written a story that anticipated an announcement later made by the company. \"Is this an example of a share tipster who has done very, very well indeed?\" Mr Hackett asked the jury. He said the City \"lived off rumours\" and that other newspapers had reported on market speculation as well as the Mirror's City Slickers column, which Mr Hipwell co-wrote. The prosecution, which alleges that Mr Hipwell misled investors about the value of shares in which he had himself invested, has claimed that many of his articles in the Mirror contained inaccuracies. Today, Mr Hackett set out the defence's interpretation of evidence the jury has heard over the past six weeks. He cast doubt on the testimony of one of the prosecution's witnesses, the former Mirror lawyer Martin Cruddace. Mr Cruddace told the court that on three separate occasions when he bought shares in companies that were soon afterwards tipped by the City Slickers he did not know they were going to be featured in the paper, and that his purchases were therefore a coincidence. But Mr Hackett said today Mr Cruddace had failed to explain his investments when cross-examined. \"I asked him to explain how he came to invest in these shares and he could not,\" Mr Hackett said. \"He was given every opportunity, and he is a lawyer, that's his background. He said, 'There has been an internal inquiry and I have been cleared.' Well, so what? We do not know the evidence at that internal inquiry and we do not know if he was cross-examined. \"Form your own views on him. If you think he was not telling the truth, form your own views on the internal inquiry that cleared him.\" Mr Hipwell and a private investor, Terry Shepherd, deny charges of manipulating the stock market between August 1999 and February 2000. The trial continues. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
