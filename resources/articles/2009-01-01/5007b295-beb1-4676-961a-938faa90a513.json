And then they want you to share your games for free. Francis Charig, Chief Executive, visited the gamesblog's elevator and gave us the skinny on their technology. Explain your product to my mum in 140 words. The Antix Game Player (\"AGP\") makes games as portable as music or video. Download and play an AGP game to your phone, and copy it to your other AGP-enabled devices such as another phone or even something like a TV and play the same game there. Buy a game, and beam it directly from your phone to someone with an entirely different handset. The copy may be a trial version to allow them to try before buying the complete game. People with different handsets can connect to your phone and play along with you in 2 player games, even without owning the game. There's more for the consumer than that but it gives a flavour of the AGP's power that is otherwise absent from rich casual and premium game engines in the market today. How do players control the product? It's no different from playing a game written directly for a Nintendo DS or an Apple iPhone. Anyway, it's determined by the developer and the AGP can be as transparent as the developer needs it to be. The point here is that we don't increase complexity at all but it's the handset provider or the game developer who decides how many key presses to start the game or what is required to receive or send a game and the play itself, joystick or keyboard or touchscreen control is really up to the person writing the game. We just provide all the necessary infrastructure to make that choice possible. What is your background? I founded the business in June of 2007 along with a great team who have accumulated between them several hundred years of experience in the design and bringing to market of rich media software platforms working for operators, handset manufacturers, games publishers, compiler companies and silicon design houses. Take a look at antixlabs.com and view the animation on the home page. This will give you an impression of our culture, AGP and the market issues that we solve. Name your competitors. Java &amp; Flash are not really competitors - already they sit comfortably alongside games written in C and C++ that are written in most cases directly for the software platform (e.g. a version for Windows Mobile, another for Symbian, for Android and for the many proprietary platforms supported by the manufacturers). C and C++ are the languages used for writing games on the Wii, PlayStation, Xbox, GBA, DS, PSP and so forth. That's where the serious gaming is taking place. But with games being written for specific devices and with an inordinate number of devices available, this means there is mass fragmentation which is at odds with an increasingly convergent world where devices have different operating systems, chipset architectures, screen sizes, input devices and so on. Apple has a strong game playing environment for the iPhone, Nokia for its NGage phones but games written for them are device specific and games cannot be shared in the same way that we can do and which we believe the market wants. If an operator wants to run games services competitive with Nokia and Apple but deployed to its subscriber base across many different handsets, connected home devices and so forth then how does it do it? Apple in particular has shown the market potential, raising the profile and addressing issues like ease of access, fun and great quality graphics but to extend this to the whole market needs Antix and in that sense there is nobody else that one can define as a competitor. How many users do you have now and what's your target in 12 months? We have two blue chip handset companies licensing our Player; we haven't yet launched it in the market. Targets are confidential. What's your biggest challenge? The economy! What's the weirdest development experience you've had thus far? We have not really had much that's weird. We have an experienced team and probably the more experience one has, the less one is surprised and so little appears to be out of the ordinary. What's your distribution/publishing plan? You're asking questions that really are under wraps - not because we don't have them, but they are confidential as our plans include some quite innovative things. Are mobile games the latest killer app? Mobile games are an important part of the overall service that a consumer expects and they have huge revenue potential having overtaken music in terms of $ generated in 2008, but over time games will decreasingly be described as \"mobile\" or \"console\" as the market converges. Are you the next big thing? I already am but have been trying to do more exercise since Christmas. The company has enormous potential and we're very confident that we have the right product at the right time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
