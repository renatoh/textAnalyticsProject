Carl Edwards and Brad Keselowski have \"previous\" that dates back to Talladega last spring. A collision between the two as they raced for the chequered flag at Nascar's fastest track sent Edwards's car airborne and into the protective fence that separates fans from the race track. Keselowski won the race while Edwards's Ford came to rest sunny side up, but on fire and 100 metres short of the line. Seven fans were injured by debris, with a 17-year-old girl knocked out. Nascar officials, having previously tolerated the robust racing that the series was famous for, reacted by outlawing \"bump drafting\", the tactic of shoving the car in front in order to increase the speed of both. Fans and drivers felt Nascar's \"no contact\" rule produced boring racing, so the authorities changed tack over the winter and announced that contact was back. \"Boys, have at it and have a good time,\" said Robin Pemberton, Nascar's vice-president of competition. Edwards was listening. Early on in last Sunday's race Keselowski and Edwards again got together, the incident resulting in the latter spending 156 laps in the garage for repairs. When he returned to the track he had \"bad intention\". Edwards's Ford and Keselowski's Dodge were running nose-to-tail when Edwards deliberately spun his rival at 195mph. Keselowski turned around and took off, coming close to hitting the fence before landing back on the track. Nascar immediately \"parked\" Edwards, who was unrepentant upon exiting his car. \"Brad knows the deal between him and I,\" Edwards said before admitting on Facebook that his actions were premeditated. \"At least I didn't do it intentionally when it happened,\" said a dazed Keselowski. \"It will be interesting to see how Nascar reacts to it. If they're going to allow people to intentionally wreck each other at tracks this fast, we will hurt someone either in the cars or in the grandstands. It's not cool to wreck someone intentionally at 195mph.\" Nascar reacted to Edwards \"having at it\" and endangering the lives of a rival and spectators by putting him on probation for the next three races \u2013 the pair will face off again at Bristol, Tennessee, next weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
