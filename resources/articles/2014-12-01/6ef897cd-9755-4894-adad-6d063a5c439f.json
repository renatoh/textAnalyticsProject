If you expected the pyrotechnics of the past three seasons \u2013 assassination attempts, bombings, impromptu crane-based executions \u2013 well, you\u2019re likely to be very disappointed indeed. But if you were just happy with something that provided some sort of emotional resolution while setting the show up for its fifth season, this did the job adequately enough. I\u2019m just about in the latter camp, though with some reservations. Ultimately, Long Time Coming didn\u2019t match its predecessors\u2019 big finishes, but nor did it need to, given the trio of action-heavy episodes that preceded it. Instead, what we got was a brooding blue note, languidly (and at times soporifically) paced but still seismic in its implications for the series in the future. Most seismic of these is the return of Saul as director of the CIA, after forming an uneasy alliance with Dar Adal. That final shot of Krieg Nicht Lieb \u2013 Dar Adal sitting in the back of Haqqani\u2019s vehicle, looking a bit shifty \u2013 hinted that he may have \u201cturned\u201d. This being Dar Adal, the truth was somewhat more complicated: he had struck a deal with Haqqani, removing his name from the CIA kill list in return for the video of Saul in Haqqani\u2019s custody, which, were it to be released, would almost certainly nix Saul\u2019s chances of getting the job. What\u2019s more, Dar Adal had promised that America would leave Haqqani alone, provided that he didn\u2019t harbour terrorists in Afghanistan. Which rather overlooks the fact that Haqqani himself is, as Saul points out, a fairly striking example of a terrorist, given that he had just killed a number of US citizens in the embassy attack. Still, a pact of non-aggression with Haqqani is the primary stipulation of Saul\u2019s return, and one he\u2019s apparently happy to observe for now. It will be interesting to see how long he is willing to go along with it in the future: that Hillary Clinton quote in Homeland\u2019s opening credits, about how \u201cyou can\u2019t keep a snake in your backyard and expect it only to attack your enemies\u201d, seems fairly apposite here. How also will Saul deal with Dar Adal, the real power behind the throne, and a man who still seems to have his own closely guarded agenda? If Saul\u2019s future looks to be with the CIA, the same can\u2019t necessarily be said of Carrie, who looked to be giving serious consideration to leaving the organisation altogether. Her desire to get out was fuelled in part by Quinn, with whom she shared an unexpected (and yet totally expected \u2013 Long Time Coming and all that) kiss at her father\u2019s wake. I\u2019ve thawed a little towards the idea of Carrie and Quinn getting together. In part because, well, we\u2019re stuck with it, aren\u2019t we? What I\u2019m less enamoured with is the thought that, as with Carrie and Brody, this is set to be a doomed romance, a theme which derailed the show in its second and third seasons. The concluding moments of Long Time Coming \u2013 Carrie deciding too late that getting out of the CIA and disappearing into the sunset with Quinn was what she wanted, then finding out that Quinn, tired of waiting, had already taken a dangerous mission fighting Isis operatives in Syria \u2013 don\u2019t augur terribly well. Still, if season five can avoid too many storylines about Carrie and Quinn endlessly attempting to reunite against the odds a la Carrie and Brody, I think there is some promise to this relationship. The tension between their obvious mutual attraction and many professional disagreements crackled nicely in this fourth season, and I\u2019d be happy to see it explored further next time. I was less on board with the introduction of Carrie\u2019s mother, who, after disappearing 15 years before, returned when she heard about the death of Carrie\u2019s father. Introducing such a significant character in a season finale is an odd move, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel that the scenes between her and Carrie felt a little artificial; plenty of opportunity for Claire Danes to show off her emotional range, but otherwise lacking in substance. More than anything, they acted as a plot mechanism: helping Carrie recognise the parallels between her own absent parenting of Frannie and her mother\u2019s mistreatment of her, and also, in her mother\u2019s admission that she didn\u2019t leave Carrie\u2019s father because of his bipolar disorder but rather because of her own infidelity, allowing Carrie to realise that her own illness needn\u2019t be a barrier to her relationship with Quinn. Good drama tends to let characterisation guide the plot, so to have such a significant figure turn up merely to help Carrie learn a couple of life lessons was very weak indeed. Better were the scenes where Carrie grieved quietly for her father. Theirs was a relationship that Homeland was committed to exploring properly, and the show did a nice job in conveying the gravity of her loss through small details: his possessions neatly arranged on his bed, his insistence of having \u201cpopcorn, soda and snow caps at the movies\u201d. Carrie\u2019s funeral speech, too, was genuinely touching. \u201cI\u2019m taking over now, Dad,\u201d she said, and it was a promise that, in the wake of the horrors of Islamabad, she seems willing to commit to. Generally, I thought that Long Time Coming encapsulated this season of Homeland: not without its flaws, but still bold, distinctive drama, and a massive improvement on those meandering past couple of seasons. There is a sense of purpose about the show again. Bring on season five! Notes and observations Making a markedly anti-American speech on Saul\u2019s TV was none other than Tasneem. It looks like she has done well out of the turbulent events in Islamabad. Can we expect her to be a player in season five? In his defence of forming a dialogue with Haqqani, Dar Adal cited Menachem Begin as someone who progressed from terrorist to political player. Begin became prime minister of Israel in 1977, 21 years after his Zionist paramilitary group Irgun killed 91 people in the 1946 King David hotel bombing. Here is a Guardian piece about another of their plots: an attempt to assassinate Ernest Bevin. Finally, a massive thanks for all your comments, theories and love letters to Quinn over the past 12 weeks. I hope you can join us again for another round of fevered speculation when Homeland returns next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
