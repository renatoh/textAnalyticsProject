The release of the final Harry Potter book, for example, or the decision that Sebastian Faulks of Birdsong fame was to write a new James Bond thriller. Last week, just such a piece of news came from Penguin Books' headquarters in London. It's a book that is expected to sell - and make - millions and introduce a new generation of readers to a classic of the Eighties cultural landscape. And yet it relies on the work of an author who, despite a near-constant presence on the bestseller lists in both the UK and USA and having books translated into some 24 languages (not to mention having Peter Kay as a fan of his stand-up comedy) is not a household name - at least, not for those without young children. He is called Eoin Colfer. He's the 43-year-old author of the Artemis Fowl series of children's fantasy books, a former teacher from County Wexford in Ireland, where he still lives, just miles from the house where he grew up. And what is the deal catapulting him to national prominence? He has been commissioned to write the sixth book in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, seven years after the death of its creator, Douglas Adams. As if that is not enough to keep Colfer busy, it has also emerged that a major Hollywood deal has been struck for another of his books - Airman, about a boy born in an air balloon who ends up having to avenge the death of his parents and his king. And that's on top of an Artemis Fowl film project involving his fellow countryman, director Jim Sheridan, whose films include My Left Foot. It is going to be hard to avoid the man whom the Guardian has credited with 'reinventing the fairy tale'. Colfer almost didn't accept the challenge of writing the new Hitchhiker's Guide. 'My first reaction was semi-outrage that anyone should be allowed to tamper with this incredible series,' he says. Needless to say, the announcement has proved controversial. Some question whether it is right for the job to have been handed to a children's author. Others are simply up in arms that anyone has been given the chance to add to Adams's work. The Times even dedicated a leading article to the topic that says: 'Sci-fi aspires to otherworldliness, but the best of it is shot through with contemporary anxieties... Adams set adrift in hyperspace a world now past; Colfer's talents would be wasted in trying to recreate it.' This is not a view shared by Adams's widow, Jane Belson, who describes herself as a Colfer fan. 'I love his books and could not think of a better person to transport Arthur, Zaphod and Marvin to pastures new,' she says. The books trade agrees with her. Waterstone's science-fiction buyer Michael Rowley describes Colfer and the Hitchhiker's Guide as an 'inspired combination'. So what is it that accounts for Colfer's extraordinary success? The best place to look for an answer is from a member of his main fan base, such as Sam Llewellyn Smith who - at 10 - is exactly the same age as Colfer's own younger son. 'His books are better than Harry Potter because they're somehow more real life,' says Sam. 'The fairies, for example, don't have magical wings; they have mechanical ones. I also really like it that in the first Artemis Fowl books, Artemis is a bad person, but he becomes good over the series.' The buyers of the 18 million copies sold worldwide (against some 16 million copies of Hitchhiker's Guide) must agree. John Spain, books editor of the Irish Independent, says that although Colfer's books are very different from those by Adams, 'they have the same sense of fantasy, humour and adventure'. And Joel Rickett, editorial director of Penguin imprint Viking, says his appeal lies in his positioning as a 'campfire storyteller with a twist'. They paint a world of fairies and leprechauns and goblins and farting dwarves through which Colfer traces the adventures of mischievous Artemis, who is 12 years old. Eoin Colfer was born in Wexford in 1965. His father was a primary school teacher and artist and his mother a drama teacher. He has four brothers (the only four people he allowed to read his early books in manuscript form) and went to the all-male Christian Brothers School. Being unsporty, his childhood was marked by the dual passions of reading and Celtic fairies, which he points out are not flowery creatures in pink tutus, but swashbucklers with axes. 'My brother Paul and I, we were obsessed. It was very much a minority thing then, as was reading, actually. You didn't have many friends you could swap books with and when you did, it would be a really tight band.' He grew up wanting to be a teacher like his parents and after Dublin University, that is what he became, moving between Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Italy, before returning to Ireland. This provided a third strand of his past that can be seen to have had a direct bearing on his books. 'I drew mostly on the kids I was teaching,' he says. Colfer's first book, Benny and Omar, which borrowed from experiences in Tunisia, was published in 1998 to moderate acclaim. The sequel, Benny and Babe, came the following year, when he also published Going Potty. The next year brought The Wish List and in 2001, the first Artemis Fowl book appeared (there are now six), the success of which allowed Colfer to leave teaching and dedicate himself to writing. There was a bidding war for the novel, earning him an estimated \u00a3700,000, which saw Bloomsbury, the Harry Potter publishers, lose out to Penguin, and Miramax buy the film rights for \u00a3250,000. When the deal was signed, Artemis Fowl was in fact described by its American publisher as 'the new Harry Potter', on account of the energetic young hero and fantasy universe it created. Colfer has said he was more inspired by Huckleberry Finn (his second son is called Finn), which taught him that the hero of a book need not be the good guy. According to one appraisal, with Artemis Fowl, Colfer 'reinvented the fairy tale by mashing it up with Die Hard-style action adventure, throwing in a sizeable dollop of scatological humour - personified by Mulch Diggums, a flatulent dwarf'. This year, anyone who wondered how Colfer would fare if he wrote without the jokes discovered that he could expect equal success, with the publication of Airman, which has caught the attention of Hollywood producer Robert Zemeckis - responsible for such animation classics as Who Framed Roger Rabbit? - and become a bestseller, too. The Observer's children's books editor, Kate Kellaway, says Colfer is the only author to have escaped the 'albatross' of being labelled the new JK Rowling. 'While he hasn't quite matched her success, he is comparable,' she says. 'And he's always said he's just writing the kind of book he'd like to have read as a child.' A self-professed member of the school reading clique who has gone on to write about a world inhabited by fairies and farting dwarves might be expected to be a somewhat retiring figure. But while Colfer says he would rather live in Wexford and commute to London and Dublin than live in a capital city, he is prepared to enter the limelight when it is required. He claims to have hated book tours at the beginning of his career and only made an effort when Terry Pratchett, the grand old man of the children's sci-fi world, told him it was necessary for success. But he has certainly embraced it now. In 2005, on his way to the Edinburgh Books Festival, Colfer found his journey disrupted by a Robbie Williams concert in Dublin and on arriving in Edinburgh to give his talk, he decided to rant about the rock star rather than discuss the book. 'What would be selfish moaning in one's own house was deemed comedy on stage,' he says. There followed a comedy tour. His subject matter expanded, too, from Robbie Williams to the Colfer family - the brothers, his wife Jackie, whom he married in 1991 and who ran a boutique in Dublin, and his two sons. The comedian Peter Kay told him: 'Listening to you talking about your childhood made me think about my own.' It was a sell-out and Michael Morpurgo, the former Children's Laureate, likens his stand-up comedy to his writing: 'He is one of the great communicators, both live and on the page.' The confident stage performer is also not immune from the occasional flamboyant touch in his personal life, driving a convertible Audi A4 that, he says, was 'bought in a moment of madness', and having purchased, in 2006, Priory Hall, which dates from the 1830s and sits in 10 acres of garden. He has converted a barn into a writer's den. Colfer says the Hitchhiker's Guide - to be called And Another Thing - is the biggest challenge of his career and at the same time 'a gift from the gods'. It is also a gift to the books trade. 'This new book will bring as many new young readers to Adams's work as it will introduce adults to the brilliance of Eoin Colfer,' says Penguin managing director Helen Fraser, who stands to benefit both ways. And then Colfer will have to pack his bag and venture out of his Wexford barn to Hollywood. The Colfer lowdown Born: Wexford, Republic of Ireland, May 1965. His parents were teachers. Married Jackie in 1991 and has two sons, Sean and Finn. He still lives in Wexford, and writes in a converted barn. Best of times: Signed deals worth almost \u00a31m for Artemis Fowl when still working as a teacher in 2001, which enabled him to give up his job and become a full-time writer. Worst of times: Has never been particularly down on his luck, although he does say he turned to fairies at school because he wasn't very popular or good at sport. What he says: 'I feel more pressure to perform now than I ever have with my own books, and that is why I am bloody determined that this will be the best book I have ever written. And if it isn't I will make sure that the cover is extremely pretty.' On being asked to write the sixth Hitchhiker's Guide book What others say: 'He brings a thoughtfulness and spontaneity to his writing and has an imaginative range that is quite extraordinary. He has made a massive contribution to children's literature.' Fellow author and former Children's Laureate Michael Morpurgo"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
