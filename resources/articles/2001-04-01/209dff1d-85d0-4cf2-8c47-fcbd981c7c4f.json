It was not difficult to discern why these sides had entered the game on the back of poor results. The early going was punctuated by free-kicks, mostly untroubling despite a few being within firing range. Among the better used, Bert Konterman's direct strike in the 16th minute was straight and true but did not ask more from the Hibernian goalkeeper Nick Colgan than to keep his concentration. For Hibernian, Franck Sauz\u00e9e swung in a ball from the left four minutes later which had Rangers' keeper, Stefan Klos, electing to punch under pressure. Konterman's attempt came after a period of sustained Rangers pressure. Even though much of it consisted of lateral passes, the exercise allowed the visitors to find their touch. Hibs, scrappier, were more reliant on kinder breaks of the ball. Rod Wallace's conversion of an Arthur Numan cross in the 27th minute may have been ruled offside, but it posted a warning, confirmed as Rangers grew in confidence in midfield. While Hibs looked most dangerous down their left, they also looked at their most vulnerable on that side, the Fernando Ricksen-Tore Andre Flo combination for Rangers giving Ulrik Laursen and Paul Fenwick an awkward time. Flo eluded his marker six minutes before the interval to run on to a Billy Dodds pass and force Colgan to block with his knees. Fenwick earned his corn, however, in the 68th minute when he made a saving tackle on Rod Wallace's breakaway and shot. Greater determination on the part of both sides in the second-half delivered a Numan shot tipped on to the crossbar by Colgan and an open-goal miss by Dodds when he over-cooked his connection with a Ricksen cross. However, it ended as it had begun: Rangers remain six points ahead of the Edinburgh side."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
