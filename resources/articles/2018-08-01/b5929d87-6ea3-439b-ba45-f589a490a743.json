Ralph Krueger, the chairman, organised the get\u2011together at a city-centre restaurant, with Gao Jisheng, the club\u2019s Chinese owner, also present, as well as Mark Hughes, to usher in the new season, one the Saints start with renewed vigour. The manager was quick to reference the instant lift that Ings, rejected as a 10-year-old schoolboy by Southampton after being deemed too small, has provided and how he is confident his five summer signings can help them solve their goalscoring troubles. They scored fewer goals than relegated West Brom on home soil last season and recorded only four league wins at St Mary\u2019s. Charlie Austin \u2013 Ings\u2019s former strike-partner at Burnley, whom Southampton host on Sunday \u2013 finished last season as joint-top scorer with just seven goals and no player has reached double figures in all competitions since 2015-16. \u201cWe just wanted to increase our potential for scoring goals and creating chances,\u201d said Hughes, who replaced Mauricio Pellegrino in March and was given a three-year contract after avoiding relegation. \u201cStuart Armstrong has always scored goals from midfield positions, Mo Elyounoussi we feel is going to be a real talent in the Premier League. We\u2019ve tried to address that and clearly Danny coming in as well will complement the strikers we already have. I think we\u2019re in a better position in terms of our attacking threat this year. \u201cWe are going to try and be better, and be better at home as well, because I think it\u2019s important that we give our fans a little more encouragement and entertainment. At times in the last couple of seasons the fare on offer has not been what everybody wanted, for whatever reason. We\u2019ve had a blip \u2013 and that\u2019s what we hope it is and what we suspect it is \u2013 last year. In terms of how the season panned out, we don\u2019t want to go down that road. We\u2019ve made purchases with a view to making sure that doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Elyounoussi, a \u00a316m arrival from Basel, is certainly a player for whom Southampton harbour high hopes; they have tracked him since 2012 and watched him about 30 times before making their move. Born in northern Morocco, the Norway international, who started his career playing under the former Sheffield United striker Brian Deane at Sarpsborg, has shone in the Swiss Super League since 2016 and scored 16 goals last season, including at Manchester City in the Champions League in March. But perhaps most important, Southampton has not proved the revolving door of recent years. As well as strengthening, they have retained key players, namely the full-backs Ryan Bertrand and C\u00e9dric Soares. The arrival of Angus Gunn has pushed Fraser Forster further down the pecking order, though, and the 30-year-old goalkeeper could be among those to leave on loan, with the striker Sam Gallagher and the left-back Sam McQueen also keen to play first-team football. The only sale this summer was the \u00a315m exit of Dusan Tadic to Ajax, while the \u00a319.2m record-signing, Guido Carrillo, and Sofiane Boufal have left on loan. Hughes said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t had too many outgoings and I think that was important. We have added freshness to the squad as well and you have to do that. It stimulates the group and allows people that have been here longer than most to be re-energised \u2013 they see new players coming into the building and players have egos, they like to compare and contrast with those coming in, to contrast the strengths and weaknesses. That stimulates the group and is a good thing, so we are pleased where we are.\u201d Southampton begin the new season against Burnley, a team evidently enjoying themselves after reaching the third qualifying round of the Europa League. Sean Dyche\u2019s side did not return from Istanbul until Friday and have already played three competitive matches. Saints qualified for the group stage two years ago and, asked if they can repeat that feat this time around, Hughes\u2019s response was bullish. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThe expectation here is that we are a top-level club, a top-half club \u2013 that\u2019s why everybody was so disappointed last year, so we will try and achieve that again. \u201cYou just have to be ready to take advantage if one of the top six \u2013 because they do have a massive advantage in this league given the resources and quality they have \u2013 take their eye off the ball or don\u2019t quite have the season that everybody expects. You have to be ready to be the one to take their place and that\u2019s how we\u2019ll approach the season. We have to try and get ourselves into a position to capitalise on that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
