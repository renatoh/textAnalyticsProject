B&amp;Q's marketing director, David Roth, said the company, a client of the Cordiant-owned advertising agency Bates for the past 20 years, had been forced to make \"contingency plans\" because of the group's financial position. \"At this busy trading period we're keen to avoid any disruption to current business and we need to make contingency plans to ensure we're not affected by the difficulties at Cordiant. However, we'd like to make it clear that we're happy with the Bates team and the service it provides,\" said Mr Roth. B&amp;Q said it had not yet decided whether to pull all its business from Bates, although it is has spoken to several London agencies, including the WPP-owned J. Walter Thompson about taking over the account. One option being looked at would be to broker a deal that would see the Bates account team working on the B&amp;Q account move across to a new agency. Cordiant owes its bankers more than \u00a3175m and has until July 15 to sell its assets or find a buyer for the company. The loss of the lucrative B&amp;Q account will be a severe blow to the agency, which has suffered a string of account losses in recent months, including Royal Mail and Woolworths. The decision of drinks giant Allied Domecq to dump Bates triggered Cordiant's latest financial crisis. Bates pioneered the use of real people in ads with its famous ads featuring B&amp;Q workers explaining \"You can do it when you B&amp;Q it\". A deal for Cordiant to sell City public relations firm Financial Dynamics to its management team for \u00a325m is understood to be imminent. The buyout is backed by Advent International, a US private equity group. Rival advertising giants Publicis and WPP are understood to have asked to see the company's books, although Cordiant warned earlier this month takeover discussions were unlikely to produce a bid at current share price levels."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
