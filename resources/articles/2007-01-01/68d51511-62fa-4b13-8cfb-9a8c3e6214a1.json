Much of the emphasis will be on trying to recruit into the cadet forces, and later into the fighting forces, those young people \"deterred by other factors\". Like rubbish housing, perhaps. \u00b7 Universities are giving their sculptures the once-over this week after a $1m (\u00a3518,000) campus artwork in the US crumbled to the ground. Kennesaw State University, Georgia, blamed faulty glue for the disintegration of the 175-tonne piece, which had been unveiled only three months ago. Finnish artist Eino had designed it to represent the fragility of the earth. Warwick, Birmingham and Glasgow universities, which have valuable sculpture collections, were said to be paying particularly close attention to their treasures. Clare Mullett, assistant curator at Birmingham University, said: \"We are keeping a watchful eye.\" \u00b7 \"Jewish students gagged at Leeds\" was the headline in the Jewish Chronicle, on a story claiming that a student union decision took away from Jewish students the \"authority to define Jewish identity\" and gave it to Palestinians. Having found the motion itself, we are pleased to report it does none of these things. Drafted by the university's Palestine Solidarity Group, it runs to 23 paragraphs and 1,782 words. But it doesn't \"gag\" anyone, and the only evidence for the allegation about Jewish identity is this: \"JSoc [the Jewish Society] is expected to expect and accept having other parties declaring and promoting opposing stands in the university, as long as Judaism as a faith is not offended.\" The motion claims that the Palestinian students were forced to spend \u00a3150 removing the words racist, apartheid and Zionist from their model of the Israeli wall of separation, but JSoc was allowed to display a map that implied Palestine did not exist. It looks as though 2007 will see the Middle East conflict fought out on UK campuses. \u00b7 If you've given up tranquillisers for the new year and are having trouble getting to sleep, you could do worse than order a copy of Single Statement of Learning and Skills Policy Requirements. The latest oeuvre from the Learning and Skills Council presents a succession of summaries of the quango's policies, in 86 pages. \"The purpose is to bring clarity, simplification and coherence to the communication of learning and skills policy requirements by systematically maintaining a single, authoritative source on an annual basis,\" it says on page 7. Even the most hardened insomniac will never have to read that far in."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
