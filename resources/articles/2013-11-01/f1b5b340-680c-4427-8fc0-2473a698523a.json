Next year's competition is in France who earlier this year ended England's unbeaten record here 30-20. So on a dank evening in south-west London this was a warming victory. It was also good entertainment for the few thousand spectators in the two lower tiers of the east and west stands who had bothered to stay behind after the Argentina match. England played expansive and effective rugby to give their visitors a drubbing with their captain and fly-half Katy McLean scoring 13 points. This was France's third game in seven days and it showed. It had been a fallow year for England until now, the loss of their Six Nations title followed by a 3-0 whitewash by the Black Ferns of New Zealand but Maggie Alphonsi, their totemic flanker, returned after a 20-month absence to win her 64th cap. She was outstanding on her comeback. England showed plenty of early ambition and Alphonsi nearly marked her return with a try after 12 minutes. She was held up just on the line after some heavy pressure by the England pack and the home side managed to recycle the ball and Amber Reed and McLean gave the full-back Kay Wilson the opportunity to touch down in the corner. France have a big pack but minutes later they turned the ball over at a maul 30 metres from their own line. McLean saw a large gap and the French cover melted away for the fly-half to score a second try near the posts that she again converted. France were at sixes and sevens and the biggest cheer of the night was soon to come. England moved the ball to their right flank and the wing Claire Allan charged forwards and slipped a pass inside for Alphonsi to run in a try from 30 metres. There was no shortage of desire from France as the England flanker Marlie Packer discovered when she was dumped into the advertising hoardings by the centre Lucille Godiveau but England were playing at a brisker tempo and using the width of the pitch much more effectively. The England backs were able to spin the ball wide again and created an overlap for Allan to help herself to a fourth try that virtually wrapped up the win before the interval. Sandrine Agricole landed two penalties but France left the pitch at the break looking bewildered. It got no better after the break. Alphonsi made another searing break before having a hand in the fifth when a huge overlap gave Wilson her second try. Perhaps England were playing with too much ambition by this stage and out of le bleu France scored a try of their own when McLean saw her pass intercepted by the centre Marion Li\u00e8vre, who touched down beneath the posts. There was another blow for England at the end of the third quarter when Wilson was forced off the field with a leg injury and Gary Street's side lost a little momentum with the French pinning them back in their own half. But England's forwards, with the substitute back-rower Hannah Gallagher, on for Packer, impressive with Alphonsi, were unyielding. For all their second-half territory France could make little impression on the England defence and the visitors were stretched again when player of the match Ruth Laybourn broke a tackle by the full-back Jessy Tremouli\u00e8re to run half the length of the field for a sixth try. Li\u00e8vre scored a late try that was no consolation at all for France. England face Canada across the road at The Stoop on Wednesday, their World Cup ambitions now back on track."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
