The Association of Teachers and Lecturers will second a resolution at the Trades Union Congress conference next week calling on the government to abandon its presumption that the attainment of a national numerical target equates to real service improvement. ATL will argue that performance league tables for schools have led to the high-stakes testing of pupils, which has narrowed their learning opportunities and increased stress and ill-health among teachers. ATL executive member Ralph Surman, who will speak on the motion, proposed by the Association of First Division Civil Servants (FDA), said: \"We need our professionalism to be restored to the heart of the rhetoric and philosophy of government. \"This would be central in winning over the hearts and minds of professionals who understand and are best placed to deliver a broad balanced and rich curriculum for children in this country. It would lift a nasty cloud of poisonous mistrust from the school workforce and those who believe they know better.\" The union, which represents around 160,000 teachers, lecturers and education professionals, will also put forward a resolution calling upon the TUC general council to persuade the government that its education and training policies need to emphasise the quality of teaching and learning rather than the delivery of knowledge and skills, so that young people and adults are actively engaged in learning on a lifelong basis. The ATL's general secretary, Dr Mary Bousted, said: \"For the last 10 years the teaching profession has been deluged with waves of national policy documents which tell teachers what they should teach (in the form of a national curriculum) and how they should teach (through the national strategies for teaching and learning. \"However, whilst there has been a strong emphasis on teaching, the word learning has barely been mentioned in government documents, Ofsted reports and other 'official publications'.\" A major reason for the \"levelling off\" in standards of achievement, she added, was that pupils are becoming disengaged from a curriculum too narrowly focused on test content and technique, which encourages \"surface\" teaching for the test rather than teaching to learn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
