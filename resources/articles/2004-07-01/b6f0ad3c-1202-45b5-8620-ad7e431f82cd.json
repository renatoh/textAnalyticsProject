It was full of bloody cranesbill, spotted, pyramidal and O'Kellii orchids. I must have passed by hundreds of times and never noticed this minuscule field. Of course orchids have their mysterious ways. Many a time I have marked where they grow only to find the following year that there were none in the same location. We know that they reproduce by seeding, but I still think some should grow in the same site! The seeds are but specks, so minute that it is a marvel they grow at all, especially since, upon germination, each seedling has to attach itself to a fungus in order to have any chance of survival. To think that, under our feet, as we walk the Burren, there might be scores of as yet unflowered orchids - the wonder of the visible and invisible. To quote Yeats: \"Tread softly because you tread on my dreams\"! So, home again, where I find, in a site different from the one I wrote about in 2002, two epipactis pendula/ phyllanthes, green-flowered helleborines. I wonder where I'll find them next year. Recently I also found two twayblades ( listera ovata ). I placed a plastic bottle over each so that our helper wouldn't cut them down when strimming. However, the wind blew one bottle over, snapping the twayblade. I put it in a jar of water and nurtured it for several weeks. Thus I had this wonder to myself. The folklore of Ancient Greece associated orchids with love, and their roots were mixed with goats' milk to make love potions. The same infusion was common in rural Ireland, with the same motive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
