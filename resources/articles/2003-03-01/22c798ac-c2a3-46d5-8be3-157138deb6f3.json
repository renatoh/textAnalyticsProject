There was a tranche of announcements at the start of this year, including a further \u00a3280m for e-learning credits to be spent on approved digital resources listed on the government's new online resources catalogue, Curriculum Online; a further \u00a3287m to give all schools a (fast) broadband connection to the internet; and \u00a38m for online training of teachers. It's a significant budget for a vibrant sector now under Clarke's personal charge. There was also an extra \u00a3195m to get more laptops into teacher's hands ( the target is 66% ownership by 2006), which is a area covered in a five-page Guardian evaluation survey of laptops carried out by Teem (Teachers Evaluating Educational Multimedia). Be warned, though. The easier access is to the web, the greater the need among teachers to be aware of safety issues, particuarly those affecting vulnerable teenagers. Young people particularly enjoy the anonymity of teenage advice sites, of which there are plenty. In a trawl through some of the sites on the internet, Connie Loga raises some worrying issues and urges teachers to be extremely cautious before recommending sites. She also mentions several approved sites, including the relatively new government-funded Connexions Direct."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
