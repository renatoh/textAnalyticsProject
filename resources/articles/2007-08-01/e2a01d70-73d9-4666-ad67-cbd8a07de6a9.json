Following the FTSE 100's biggest drop in four years and sell-offs throughout Asia and Europe, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dived by as much as 340 points forcing stock market authorities to implement trading curbs. But in the final hour of trading, banking shares led a recovery and the US blue-chip index ended with a fall of just 15 points to 12,845. Investors took heart from comments by the government-backed home loans guarantor, Fannie Mae, that it may be allowed to raise temporarily a cap on its ability to buy mortgages. The US Federal Reserve had pumped $17bn of short-term funds into the financial system in an attempt to improve liquidity. At one point, the Dow was down 10% on its record close just a month ago. The credit ratings agency Moody's warned such was the volatility that a major hedge fund could be caught unable to unwind positions, triggering a collapse of the scale of Long Term Capital Management's demise nine years ago. Moody's vice-chairman, Chris Mahoney, estimated that there was a 50% chance of a shock equivalent to LTCM's losses: \"A possible consequence of the repricing of risk assets would be the failure and disorderly liquidation of a hedge fund or other institution of sufficient size as to disrupt markets, as LTCM threatened to do in 1998.\" Nick Parsons, head of market strategy at NAB Capital in London, said the widening credit spread between US treasury bonds and three-month interbank rates on Wall Street were evidence that the money markets were seizing up. \"The only name the markets are prepared to lend to is the US government,\" he said. Aversion to risk was also apparent in the currency markets, where the Japanese yen rose sharply across the board. It was up by four yen against the dollar at 113.4 and from 233.80 to 224.90 against the pound. Sterling, until recently one of the main beneficiaries of the yen carry trade, was under pressure against the dollar, closing at $1.978. In the US, all eyes were on Countrywide, which employs 54,000 people and wrote more than $400bn of mortgages annually at the height of the US housing market. It became the biggest lender yet to admit that it was facing a struggle for survival by saying it had tapped all of a $11.5bn contingency credit line provided by 40 of the world's largest banks for use in times of distress. Its president, David Sambol, said: \"Countrywide has taken decisive steps which we believe will address the challenges arising in this environment and enable the company to meet its funding needs and continue growing its franchise.\" Countrywide usually sells on its loans to other financial institutions and profits by pocketing the proceeds. But fears of default by less affluent householders have caused buyers of these loans to shy away, leaving the firm with huge liabilities. Analysts were far from certain that Countrywide will survive. Paul Miller, a banking analyst at US broker Friedman, Billings, Ramsay &amp; Co, suggested bankruptcy was a possibility if the liquidity crisis lasted for more than a month: \"Countrywide may be forced to sell assets at a deep discount, putting tremendous pressure on its book value and stock price.\" The 10th largest home loans firm, American Home Mortgages, collapsed last month and another major player, Thornburg Mortgages, is in trouble. First Magnus, an Arizona firm with 5,400 staff which funded 160,000 mortgages last year, yesterday shut its doors saying it was taking no new business. The US commerce department released figures yesterday showing that the pace of home building in the US fell by more than 6% to a 10-year low last month, while the number of building permits, a good guide to future construction activity, was down 2.8% in July to its lowest level in 11 years. The US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, conceded that market turmoil will extract \"a penalty\" on economic growth and that there would be bankruptcies. But he brushed aside fears of a recession. \"My strong belief is, although it will take a while to work through these issues and although there will be bumps along the way and there will be losses along the way and some institutions will cease to exist, we have a market and an economy strong enough to absorb it,\" he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. Mining companies such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto plunged on fears that a construction slowdown will hit demand for raw materials. The price of crude oil dropped $2.88 a barrel to $70.47. In Australia, mortgage company Rams Home Loans revealed it had been unable to refinance A$6.17bn of short-term loans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
