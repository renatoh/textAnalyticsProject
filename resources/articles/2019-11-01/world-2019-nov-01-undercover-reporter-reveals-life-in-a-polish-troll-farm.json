That\u2019s why they use nonsense to pull the wool over people\u2019s eyes,\u201d replies Magda Rostocka, whose profile tells her almost 4,400 followers she is \u201cleft-handed with her heart on the right\u201d. In reality, neither woman existed. Both accounts were run by the paid employees of a small marketing company based in the city of Wroc\u0142aw in southwest Poland. But what the employee pretending to be Magda Rostocka did not know is that the colleague pretending to be Girl from \u017boliborz was an undercover reporter who had infiltrated the company, giving rare insight into the means by which fake social media accounts are being used by private firms to influence unsuspecting voters and consumers. Social media companies are coming under increasing pressure over fake accounts. Facebook has said it disabled 2.2bn fake accounts in the first three months of 2019, but the European Commission this week said there was a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between such claims. The undercover reporter, Katarzyna Pruszkiewicz, spent six months this year working at Cat@Net, which describes itself as an \u201cePR agency comprising specialists who build a positive image of companies, private individuals and public institutions \u2013 mostly in social media.\u201d. A member of the Reporters\u2019 Foundation, a consortium of Polish investigative journalists, Pruszkiewicz\u2019s first task when she joined the company was to set up a social media avatar for sharing \u201csocial and political content\u201d with the aim of attracting 500 followers. After a trial period, she was given access to the company\u2019s internal communications channels, through which the company\u2019s employees, each of whom ran a dozen or so social media accounts, would receive guidance and instructions from their managers \u2013 what issues to engage with, who to promote, and who to denigrate. The accounts produced both leftwing and rightwing content, attracting attention, credibility and support from other social media users, who could then be rallied in support of the company\u2019s clients. \u201cThe aim is to build credibility with people from both sides of the political divide. Once you have won someone\u2019s trust by reflecting their own views back at them, you are in a position to influence them,\u201d said Wojciech Cie\u015bla, who oversaw the investigation in collaboration with Investigate Europe, a consortium of European investigative reporters. \u201cReading these communications, you can see how the leftwing and rightwing accounts would receive their daily instructions, how they would be marshalled and directed like two flanks of the same army on a battlefield.\u201d A majority of Cat@Net\u2019s employees are understood to be disabled, allowing the company to derive substantial public subsidies from Poland\u2019s National Disabled Rehabilitation Fund. According to the Reporters Foundation, the company has received about 1.5 million zloty (\u00a3300,000) from the fund since November 2015. \u201cMany of them are really good people \u2013 they are compassionate, they do charity work and engage in social activism in their spare time, but their disabilities mean that their employment opportunities are limited,\u201d Pruszkiewicz told the Guardian. \u201cFor them it was just work and that\u2019s it.\u201d One of Pruszkiewicz\u2019s responsibilities was to operate anonymous accounts with instructions to promote content produced by TVP, Poland\u2019s state broadcaster, which is widely reviled by critics for its extreme partisanship and hate speech directed against minority groups. \u2018It would be great if you posted positive comments about the government\u2019s subsidy for TVP and the television licence fee,\u2019 read an email from her manager. An internal report seen by the Guardian details how the fake accounts were used to denigrate legitimate criticism of the broadcaster. According to an analysis by ISD Global, a London-based thinktank that studies global trends in extremism and polarisation, Cat@Net accounts created up to 10,000 posts in defence of TVP, with a potential reach of 15 million views. Another beneficiary of Cat@Net\u2019s influence operations was a recently elected member of the Polish parliament for the leftwing Democratic Left Alliance party. Cat@Net\u2019s leftwing accounts promoted the politician\u2019s candidacy to the European Parliament in elections held in May this year, with at least 90 different accounts circulating and responding to his social media posts. The company\u2019s rightwing accounts would then oppose the leftwing accounts, generating conflict and traffic, thereby drawing attention to the candidate. \u201cIf [he] is followed only by our accounts, this is really suspicious,\u201d wrote one employee during an internal discussion of the campaign. Accounts were created that would concentrate on the aviation and defence industries, and target key decision-makers involved in the awarding of major government defence contracts. The accounts were used to undermine public support for the Polish government\u2019s decision to place a major order with the American contractor Lockheed Martin for the F-35 fighter jet, promoting instead the Eurofighter Typhoon produced by a consortium that includes Airbus, BAE Systems, and Leonardo \u2013 which has a Polish subsidiary, PZL \u015awidnik. Cat@Net employees were reminded by their managers that \u201cthe F-35 is our enemy number one\u201d but \u201cdon\u2019t be too pushy with the Eurofighter, otherwise they will know they are being trolled\u201d. It is unclear whether the organisations and individuals on whose behalf the fake accounts were lobbying were aware of Cat@Net\u2019s practices. Internal documents suggest the company received most if not all of its commissions from an external PR company, which may have been outsourcing the influence operations without its clients\u2019 knowledge. PZL \u015awidnik said it \u201cconducts its business activities in an ethical manner in all respects\u201d and any supplier of services to it is required to comply with its code of ethics. It denied engaging in any wrongdoing regarding communications practices relating to disinformation, hate speech, or attempts to influence political decisions. \u201cThe big question is how regulators everywhere are going to respond to the challenge posed by this kind of activity,\u201d said Peter Pomerantsev, a London-based expert on disinformation and author of This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality. \u201cThey might argue that none of the content that was shared was illegal \u2013 it wasn\u2019t hate speech, it wasn\u2019t inciting violence, it wasn\u2019t war propaganda. But what it exposes is just how flimsy and ineffective our regulatory framework is, and how vulnerable we are to more dangerous actors using similar techniques.\u201d In a statement posted to its website, Cat@Net strongly denied it was a \u201ctroll farm\u201d: \u201cThe company\u2019s field of activity is the outsourcing of marketing operations to social media. We communicate accurate information, speak for our clients, and promote their products and services like any other agency of its kind.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
