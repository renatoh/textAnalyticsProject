Crunch! Thwack! Take that, you ****ing ****! Even before a ball has been kicked in the Premier League, the football publishing championship is in full swing, accompanied by the unedifying but lucrative noise of axes being ground, slights avenged, and punches thrown from a safe distance. Roy Keane, of course, is at the centre of attention, principally for disclosing that his tackle on Alfie Haaland in the Manchester derby last year was committed with intent to injure his opponent - as if anyone who saw it at the time could have been in any doubt. If the nature of Keane's revenge were not by itself enough to confirm the impression that this great player has a couple of screws loose, his other major revelation certainly does. The description of his last-minute withdrawal from the Ireland squad at the World Cup this summer may have added little to the copious amount of evidence already published, but it forms a masterpiece of deluded self-justification. And Keane is not the only football person whose autobiography can be found filling the sports pages with bile this week. His old boss Brian Clough is ranting about Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Sir Alex Ferguson, and anything that comes to whatever is left of his mind, all over the back of the Sun. When players and managers tell their stories in the form of an autobiography, they follow an increasingly predictable pattern. Their publishers will pay them a hefty advance - somewhere between \u00a31m and \u00a31.5m in Keane's case, it is said - on the understanding that they include a few juicy stories of conflict between the author and other well known football personalities, in order to attract offers for the serialisation rights from newspapers. The more lurid the anecdotes, the more money the newspapers will pay. And because serial rights are usually split between publisher and author, the former will please the company accountants by getting a good chunk of the advance back before publication, while the latter will make some extra dosh for no extra work whatsoever. And a prominent serialisation, preferably one that provokes continuing news coverage, acts as a more effective sales tool than any number of good reviews. In the case of Clough's disclosures, the sensible response is to avert the eyes and move quietly away. In 1994, a year after his retirement, he published a sturdy and apparently comprehensive autobiography. What new can he have to tell us? That he stopped drinking before it killed him, certainly. That he is proud of the achievement of his son, Nigel, in gaining promotion to the Conference with Burton Albion, perhaps. But, judging by the material that has already appeared in the Sun, his criticisms of Arsenal's disciplinary record are out of date, while his opinion of Ferguson's decision to postpone his retirement is hardly to be taken seriously from a man who so clearly botched the timing of his own departure. Yet this is trivial stuff, and only those who choose to waste their time and money on such a load of tosh will have any reason for complaint. In Keane's case, however, the matter will provoke a more serious debate on the state of the game. Football is not flower-arranging. It has always been a physical game and so it must remain. But a balance must be maintained, and there is a feeling that, thanks to the achievements and reputations of players such as Keane, Patrick Vieira and Steven Gerrard, the desirable equilibrium is under threat. Players are such fast and powerful athletes nowadays that the pitch has become a very crowded place. No one is given time or space to dwell on the ball. There is a premium on the ability to anticipate an opponent's pass and dispossess the recipient before he has had time to take control. Between the strong men of midfield, such as Keane, Vieira and Gerrard, the battle is at its fiercest and most heavily symbolic. Keane versus Haaland came into that category, and the Irishman did not so much walk across the threshold of unacceptable conduct as drive a tank through it. His \"honesty\" in admitting the nature of his intentions is simply a way of making more money from what - even if it was not directly responsible for Haaland's subsequent injury problems - amounted to an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. It seems astonishing that Manchester United's representatives should have read a copy of the manuscript and endorsed its publication. What was the difference between Keane's assault on Haaland and Eric Cantona's on Matthew Simmons? At least Cantona had the excuse of genuine provocation. Keane, too, should have been prosecuted under the law of the land. Too late for that, now. But not too late for the FA to level a charge of bringing the game into disrepute, and to fine him a sum exactly equivalent to his earnings from his wretched book."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
