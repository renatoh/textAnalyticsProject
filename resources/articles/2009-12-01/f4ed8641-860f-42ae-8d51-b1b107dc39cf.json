The telecoms operator has warned that it will take legal action if the government presses ahead in the new year with plans to liberalise the nation's mobile phone spectrum. BT's move could derail a key part of the government's Digital Britain programme. The government's pledge to introduce universal broadband access of at least 2Mb a second in time for the London Olympics was seen as one of the least contentious parts of the final Digital Britain report in June. But universal access requires changes to the way the airwaves are split between the UK's five mobile phone networks, so they can run mobile broadband services in rural areas where fixed-line services are too slow. It also requires the sale of new space on the spectrum that will be freed-up when the analogue TV signal is switched off in 2012. The government appointed the former regulator Kip Meek as an Independent Spectrum Broker to try to thrash out a deal with the networks. Part of his proposals included letting them run mobile broadband on the spectrum they were given in the 1980s and 1990s for voice and text services. In return, the five networks would have the 3G licences, which they snapped up for \u00a322.5bn in the dotcom boom, extended indefinitely. Those licences are due to expire in 2021. Meek also suggested tying the sale of the old analogue TV signal with the sale of a new part of the airwaves at 2.6Ghz, which is perfect for super-fast broadband in urban areas. He also proposed capping the amount of spectrum that any one operator could own. BT, however, has sent a \"letter before action\" to the business secretary, Lord Mandelson, raising serious objections to Meek's plans and threatening a judicial review if they are implemented. The company believes the mobile phone companies are being given an unjustifiable government subsidy by having their 3G licences extended. It also wants the government to be more even-handed with new entrants when it comes to selling off new wireless spectrum. BT is believed to be interested in snapping up a sizeable chunk of the 2.6Ghz spectrum and using it for super-fast wireless broadband in towns and cities. \"BT has major reservations around the wireless spectrum proposals from the Independent Spectrum Broker,\" said a BT spokesman, confirming that the company had written to the government. \"The proposal to extend current 3G licenses indefinitely represents a gift of several billion pounds from the UK taxpayer to the mobile operators and is a barrier to competition and innovation in the mobile market,\" he said. \"We would like spectrum to be auctioned in a way that is fair to all operators and stimulates competition in the market for both existing operators and new entrants,\" he added. \"We are discussing our concerns with BIS and are hopeful that these will be addressed.\" The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has already extended the deadline for consultation on Meek's plans by a further month in an effort to appease BT. But senior figures within the mobile phone industry have warned that the new deadline \u2013 of 5 February \u2013 could leave the government with no time to enact the necessary secondary legislation before a general election. Mobile phone industry executives are also livid at BT's opposition to changes to the spectrum regime, given that the company itself will benefit from the 50p-a-month telephone tax , which will be in next year's finance bill. The tax is designed to raise upwards of \u00a3175m a year to help pay for the roll-out of the next generation of super-fast broadband networks in rural areas. BT is expected to be the main recipient of the cash. Some senior mobile phone industry insiders have also pointed out that while BT objects to anything that helps out their industry, it is currently fighting for the right to be able to demand that the entire fixed-line telecoms industry helps pay its pensions bill. BT is locked in talks with the regulator Ofcom about trying to narrow its pension deficit by raising the price that its Openreach business charges everyone else for access to its residential phone lines."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
