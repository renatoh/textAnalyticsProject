After Beckham was not picked for the Team GB football squad by Stuart Pearce, the London 2012 chairman, Lord Coe, had said that the 37-year-old's contribution in bringing the Games to London would be recognised. The Guardian reported on Monday that Beckham was set to play a role in the opening ceremony, amid increasing speculation that the boxing legend Muhammad Ali will also have a part. Beckham is expected to take part in a parade of well-known figures as part of the build-up to the lighting of the flame. The organisers are desperately trying to keep secret the identity of the person performing this ceremony. \"It is some kind of role in the opening ceremony which I am honoured to be involved in because obviously I was involved in the start process with this seven years ago,\" said Beckham. \"And for Seb to have kept me involved I'm very proud of that.\" Beckham was in Singapore in 2005 as part of the delegation that won the Games for London and has not hidden his desire to be part of them, despite missing out on a berth in Pearce's 18-man squad. Beckham said he planned to criss-cross the Atlantic during the Olympics to fulfil his Major League Soccer commitments as well as watch some sport. \"I'll be going back and forward but I'll definitely be trying to get to a few events,\" he said. The former Manchester United midfielder appeared at the Westfield shopping centre adjacent to the Olympic Park on Monday and said he could feel the excitement growing during a visit to the stadium. \"I was at the stadium yesterday and the park yesterday and you can feel the kind of atmosphere building,\" Beckham said. \"I was brought up around this side of London and to actually see the changes that have happened and the excitement that's going on is a proud moment.\" However, Beckham is saddened that he will not get to play in Britain's first Olympic football team since the 1960 Games despite making 115 appearances for England, a record for an outfield player, and he has not given up hope of representing his country again. \"I'll always have ambitions in football as long as I am playing,\" Beckham said. \"I might be 37 years old but I still want to win championships, I still want to continue to be the best that I can be and continue to represent my country in any way, shape or form.\" The International Olympic Committee will brief all competing nations on Thursday in an attempt to avoid them dragging their feet at the opening ceremony. There is a feeling that the parade of athletes at recent Games has become too unwieldy, with some teams moving too slowly round the track while they take pictures and pick out familiar faces. While keen not to spoil the experience for the 204 nations that take part, the IOC and London 2012 organisers are keen that all teams make their way round the stadium at a reasonable speed. It is understood they have come up with various \"devices\" to ensure that teams maintain an even pace. The opening ceremony director, Boyle, has previously joked that Underworld, who are composing the score, had been told to speed up the beat of the marching music."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
