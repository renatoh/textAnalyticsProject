Five days before England arrive in Tallinn, Croatia are here tonight and although superficially this looks like a certain three points for the visitors - even Croatia's manager, Slaven Bilic, has suggested that Estonia are not as strong as in recent years - he is also aware that even if Estonia cannot win they may eke out a draw that would shape the group as much as a rare victory. Estonia may have only 1.3m citizens but in the last European Championship campaign they were tough enough to draw 0-0 at home with the eventual group winners, Bulgaria. More pertinently for Bilic, Estonia's first game in that group was in Osijek where they also drew 0-0. The two points dropped then meant that Croatia finished second and had to come through a play-off against Slovenia. But, unlike England, this time around Croatia come to Tallinn with their destiny in Group E in their own hands. A Croat win tonight would put them five points ahead of England at the top of the group - with the same number of games played - and would leave them confident about the task awaiting them next Wednesday back in Zagreb, against Russia. By next Thursday there is a chance that Croatia will have sealed one of the qualifying spots, intensifying the pressure on England and Russia. Given that Croatia have already drawn in Moscow, beaten England and won in Israel, six points from these two fixtures does not appear an unrealistic expectation. But even a manager as young as Bilic is sensibly cautious beforehand. \"To us the Russia game doesn't even exist,\" he said this week. \"We are fully concentrated on Estonia. I have been told Estonia do not seem to be as strong as they were but although they have lost every game in the group so far they only lost 1-0 to Macedonia and 2-0 against Russia. In the Macedonia game they had more opportunities and should have won. So I don't think Estonia are a joke. They just started the qualifiers on the wrong foot.\" That wrong-footing has left Estonia's Dutch coach, Jelle Goes, vulnerable. He had been praised for his work in the World Cup qualifying campaign, when Estonia won five games and drew 1-1 with Russia. Four of those victories, though, were against Liechtenstein and Luxembourg and the other was at home to Latvia. \"But with sides of the quality of England, Croatia, Russia and Israel we're now in a group that's much tougher,\" Goes said. \"These are difficult teams to beat and even Macedonia are a hard side to overcome.\" England are not the only major footballing nation in danger of missing out on Euro 2008. Spain face Latvia in Riga tonight knowing that defeat could have serious consequences for their chances of reaching next year's tournament. Northern Ireland lead Group F on 13 points, with Sweden one point behind and Spain trailing on nine points in third. Luis Aragon\u00e9s's side will be under pressure to produce a positive result and must do so without four key players, including the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid striker Fernando Torres. Fernando Morientes is also missing, meaning David Villa must provide the chief attacking threat. \"I don't think there is a dependency on me. We have a lot of good forwards in the Spanish team,\" he said. \"It's taken me a lot of work to become a regular; there have been a lot of contests where I haven't played. I'll go out there and hope not to lose my place.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
