Following numerous complaints from British officials, Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, issued a mild rebuke to Nashi, a fanatical nationalist youth movement that has been stalking Britain's ambassador, Anthony Brenton. The group took exception to a meeting Mr Brenton attended last summer. It has been harassing him since September - tailing his car, dumping leaflets on his windscreen and heckling him at meetings. After a meeting on Tuesday with Nashi's leader, Vasily Yakemenko, Mr Lavrov said the group had agreed to abide by the Vienna convention, which protects diplomats from harassment. Yesterday, however, Nashi said it would continue its campaign until the ambassador \"apologised\". \"Our position is that Anthony Brenton has to say sorry or leave Russia. He says that he wants civil society. Our pickets against him are part of civil society,\" a Nashi spokeswoman, Anastasia Suslova, told the Guardian. Nashi - which means \"our own\" - says Mr Brenton is \"guilty\" for attending a conference of opposition parties last summer, just before the G8 summit in St Petersburg. They are angry that he shared a platform with Eduard Limonov, a radical critic of Russia's president, Vladimir Putin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
