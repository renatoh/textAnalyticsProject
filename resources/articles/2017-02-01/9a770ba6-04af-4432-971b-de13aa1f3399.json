It was in the Midlands 14 months ago, the night before a 2-1 win over West Bromwich Albion, that the \u201crealisation of what happened\u201d hit him. Nine days earlier his fiancee Rachel had given birth to a stillborn daughter, Renee. Arter broke down and walked out of the hotel, sobbing. Arter heads back to the Hawthorns on Saturday, with a new baby daughter waiting at home for him. At midday last Friday, in a planned caesarean, Raine Renee Arter was born at the Portland hospital in Marylebone, London. \u201cIt has been an emotional week but I am very happy,\u201d Arter says. \u201cIt is very hard to put into words because I was kind of in shock, I guess. There was a lot of anxiety and it was a strange moment, really. It was a surreal day. Anyone who has had a caesarean before, the procedure is actually quite quick. From the time they put the epidural in her back \u2013 which started to work after five to 10 minutes \u2013 the baby was out within four minutes.I don\u2019t think anything in my life will be able to replicate that feeling.\u201d Arter articulates clearly and with great courage. It speaks volumes that he and Rachel discussed the coincidental timing of the West Bromwich Albion fixture this week. \u201cI actually said to my missus a couple of days ago that this was the first away game after Renee and this is the first since Raine,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a real tough period of my life, and hopefully it will not be too emotional in that sense because my main focus is to make sure we win. I can remember it like it was yesterday, it was Christmas time and I was seeing families with their kids. I was thinking: \u2018I wish that was me.\u2019\u201d Now it is. Arter feels it has given him a \u201cspring in his step\u201d. His positive outlook echoes the words inked on his right forearm. A tattoo reads, \u201cSetbacks pave the way for comebacks\u201d, just above Renee\u2019s date of birth \u2013 10-12-15. He and Rachel placed the hat provided for Renee\u2019s memory box, given to them by the charity 4Louis, on Raine\u2019s head when she was born. Renee is also Raine\u2019s middle name and it is a name that Arter says any of his future daughters would also carry. \u201cIt is important,\u201d the 27-year-old says, after slowly absorbing the question. \u201cWe wanted her to have her sister\u2019s middle name and when she gets a little bit older, we can explain to her why. I am sure she will understand and hopefully want to learn about her sister. It is important to tell her at the right age, we would not want to tell her too early and it was important for us \u2026 not to make us remember, because having that as her middle name would not necessarily make us remember Renee more.\u201d Arter has taken an unorthodox route to the Premier League via Staines Town, Woking and then Bournemouth, for whom he regularly plays in front of thousands of fans, but it was the prospect of changing Raine\u2019s nappies at a London hospital that left him feeling a little daunted, in front of only a handful of spectators. \u201cI felt more pressure watching people watch me change a nappy than I do playing football,\u201d Arter says, with a smile. \u201cWhen I was in the hospital they asked me to change one and when there was a big crowd \u2013 of about five people \u2013 there I did not want to do it.\u201d Arter believes the ups and downs over the past 14 months or so has put everything into context, giving him a further sense of perspective and he admits to struggling to see the importance of results towards the end of last season. \u201cYou understand what is important in life and what is not,\u201d he says. \u201cThe way I am with Raine, I am not too sure I would be so hands-on if it was not for Renee. For any family that loses somebody \u2013 regardless of if it\u2019s a baby \u2013 it definitely does change you for the positive. When negatives happen, you look at your life a lot differently to try and change it for the positive and I am really thankful for Renee for that. \u201cI went through a phase towards the end of the season, I was finding football very tough to be bothered about results. Of course, three points tomorrow [Saturday] is not life or death \u2013 but professionally it is. I had to kind of understand that and when I understood it I could put it right. It is my profession, I have to be professional, I had to understand that.\u201d Arter speaks of Raine as a \u201crainbow baby\u201d \u2013 a phrase used by some parents to compare their new child to the beautiful sight after a storm. Arter posted a message with a rainbow backdrop when he announced the birth of Raine. \u201cI learned that [phrase] after Renee passed, before that I did not have a clue what it meant,\u201d he says. \u201cThat message is important to me to understand my feelings. I think it is a very important message. Now I understand totally what it means. I was worried that I would feel a tad guilty that the new baby is here and now all my attention is here \u2013 which it does have to be, if I am being honest. I just feel that message is a nice message to make me understand that even though there is a beautiful baby here now, it does not mean that Renee did not exist and everything is fine now. In an ideal world I would love them both to be here.\u201d A rainbow emoji also accompanied his thank you message on social media, to the \u201cfour or five thousand\u201d people who sent individual congratulatory messages. \u201cOn the Saturday [after Raine\u2019s birth], I went through the messages and it was very overwhelming, for someone who played non-league seven years ago to be playing in the Premier League now, to get messages from teams in the Conference, in League Two and so many messages sending their best wishes to myself and Rachel.\u201d He has been inundated. Arter has been touched by heartfelt well wishes from Pep Guardiola, four days before Raine\u2019s birth, opposition supporters and by those far beyond the footballing community. \u201cThe social media side of things was lovely,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was hard to catch up on all the messages because there was so many. Social media sometimes has some bad times and not so nice messages but it is nice when everybody is so positive. It does not matter if they were very well-known or just a local fan who nobody has ever heard of. To receive a message from somebody who has taken time out of their day \u2013 I am really thankful for all the messages.\u201d There was the hair-raising moment eight minutes into Bournemouth\u2019s match at Turf Moor, when Burnley supporters joined away fans in a minute\u2019s applause. It was Renee\u2019s first birthday, one Arter and Rachel insisted they would celebrate. \u201cThe Burnley gesture was unbelievable,\u201d he says. \u201cI have still got it on record on my telly, it is nice to look back on sometimes and I am honestly so thankful for that. It was a club I have never had anything to do with, to be honest \u2013 I never played for them or anything like that \u2013 I was so thankful for that.\u201d On the day of Raine\u2019s birth Arter\u2019s Bournemouth team-mates were overseas, wrapping up a three-day training camp at Real Madrid\u2019s Ciudad complex, so he sent them a message on the group chat to inform them of Raine\u2019s arrival into the world. \u201cWe have such a close-knit group here, they shared the experience for me last year and it was nice for them too that the baby was here safe,\u201d he says. Arter has a tight bond with Eddie Howe as well, and the Bournemouth manager says he sensed the player\u2019s \u201crelief and happiness\u201d on his return from the Spanish capital. Howe \u2013 without naming names \u2013 feels some of his squad have benefited from the discipline that fatherhood brings. \u201cI think it will affect him, change him but all for the better,\u201d Howe says. Arter \u201cdefinitely wants more kids\u201d but insists now is for him and Rachel, who is three years younger, to enjoy Raine and rest physically, mentally and emotionally. \u201cI want her [Rachel] to enjoy her life again,\u201d Arter says. \u201cShe has been pregnant for the last two years so it\u2019s important for her to get her life back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
