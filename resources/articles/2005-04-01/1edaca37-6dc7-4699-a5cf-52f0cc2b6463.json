Arsenal can still end this season with a trophy, with an FA Cup semi-final against Blackburn Rovers to come on Saturday, but Cole described the campaign as \"disappointing\" and believes the club might have enjoyed greater success with a deeper and more experienced squad. \"The club definitely needs to invest to avoid being left behind,\" the left-back told New Nation weekly. \"We've got a great young squad, but when it comes to vital games maybe we would have got out of jail with a bit more experience. \"It is quite hard sometimes when you see Chelsea and even Manchester United buying big-name players and chucking their money around. You would love your club to have a lot of money to buy great players. \"Of course it is good that we are bringing the young ones through. But sometimes I think if we would have had a top-class midfielder, or a top-class player to fill someone's boots, it would have been a little bit easier.\" Cole pointed out that Arsenal's current points total would usually leave them with a chance of winning the title but noted that other teams, notably Chelsea, have improved. He and Chelsea face possible disciplinary action over a meeting to discuss a potential transfer earlier this season. Submissions to the Premier League were due in yesterday and an independent commission could be set up as early as next week, although it is unlikely to meet before Arsenal and Chelsea play at Stamford Bridge next Wednesday. The case could even be delayed for longer depending on the availability of commission members. However, it is hoped that it will be heard before the end of the month. By then Cole hopes Arsenal will be looking forward to a Cup final. \"We need to win [against Blackburn] first, but it would be a great day if we could play against Man U in the final and beat them,\" he said. \"It would be an amazing time because we owe them after they beat us twice this season, and it would be a fitting last final in Cardiff.\" Leeds United's misfiring striker David Healy, who has scored just one goal in his last 18 appearances for club and country, might not play again this season after sustaining an ankle injury in Saturday's 2-1 victory over Watford. The 25-year-old limped off in the 27th minute and will now undergo a scan to ascertain the extent of the damage. He is likely to be absent for between two and six weeks. The incoming Millwall chairman Jeff Burnige has denied that his arrival heralds a downturn in the club's ambitions. \"We have now established ourselves as a club expected to challenge for promotion to the Premiership, and that remains our aim,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
