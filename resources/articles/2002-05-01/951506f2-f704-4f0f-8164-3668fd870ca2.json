Despite its name, it is not a boathouse, but a pleasure pavilion or viewing platform for wealthy private clients. It is something one just comes upon. For all its boldness, it integrates gracefully into the landscape, almost disappearing against the greenery. It looks like a glass box floating on the river, and juts out sharply over the water. There is a sense of magic to it, since you can barely see the structure that supports it. If you are inside looking out, you experience a sort of weightlessness as you gaze over the river. Completely contrasting in scale and context is London's Centre Point, by architect Richard Seifert. It has become quite a landmark in London, with its distinctive V-shaped concrete cladding. But the building is austere and uninviting, like a monument. I have nothing against tall buildings, but we architects shape the environment people live in. It is up to us to make them come alive through the people who use them. \u00b7 Annette Fisher is a candidate for the presidency of the RIBA, and the architect of the Square Restaurant, Regent Street, London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
