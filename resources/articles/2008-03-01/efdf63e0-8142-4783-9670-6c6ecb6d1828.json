About the people I had come to meet in that country, their roguish humour, their everyday ways and lives, and the delicate balance they had struck in order to live those lives under tyranny. During the late Seventies, I had shared a flat in Manchester with Jonathan Powell - my then fellow researcher on Granada Reports, the nightly news programme in north-west England - who became Tony Blair's chief of staff. Some twenty-odd years later, I watched him alight from Blair's helicopter at Camp David near Washington - wearing sunglasses and poised on the burdensome eve of war - to be greeted by President George Bush and Donald Rumsfeld (who at least knew what they were doing). In my mind's eye, watching the handshakes , I recalled, with fondness but looming dread, conversations I had had in Fallujah about football, in Basra about rock'n'roll. I thought about the ever-open doors and welcoming spreads of food and beer the Iraqis invariably laid on, the barefoot waifs who gathered at football matches and lovers who spent evenings in parked cars, protected from view by newspaper lining the windows. As the Marine Band struck up a tune, Rumsfeld gave my former flatmate an older man's smile as if to say: 'Good to have you on board'. And I wondered whether any of the defiant good humour and hospitality for which I loved Iraq would survive what was coming. I remembered Iraq first time around, in 1991. The news arrived in Baghdad that the Royal Air Force had missed a bridge across the Euphrates and instead hit the marketplace of a town of which I'd never heard, Falluja, killing 240 civilians. We set off to cover the story with trepidation. My companion was the late, great Bob Simpson of BBC Radio. When we arrived amid the wreckage, and presented ourselves tentatively to gathered groups of lads, something unexpected happened. Upon realising we were British, they wanted to know which football team we supported - 'Meester, are you Leeverpooool or Manchesterrr United?' Another man asked: 'Meester, which do you like, the Beeeatles or the Who?', and we shifted to that discourse, generally favouring the Beatles. Bob and I were grateful for this introduction to Falluja, but made some remark akin to: 'But... we've just bombed your market!' The boys agreed it had been terrible, but 'it was not you, it was your leaders'. And thus we proceeded through the wretched streets, into the well kept homes of Falluja, where Terfeh Mehsan sat on a cushion beside her grandson Abdullah, 12, with stumps and septic wounds where his legs used to be. He liked watching cartoons and football on television. Uncle Hamid Mehsan was forgiving and gentle, but could not hide a moment of acrid reflection: 'The British? It is not a matter of hatred. We know the British are the colonial people.' But apart from Uncle Hamid's remark, every visit to every home was accompanied by coffee and food without hostile comment. The pleading and pain over what the RAF had done was, by way of balance and almost good manners, followed by further talk of English sport, music and even Graham Greene, with a medical student. It was the same in Shia Basra where, among those who are not supposed to consume alcohol, there was usually a bottle of something in the cupboard to share. In Basra, a devout biology student told us how he had witnessed the public burning to death of leaders of the 1991 Shia uprising, then inquired that if the Stone Roses ever made a second album, could we try and get a copy to him. When we offered to pay for our meal, he asked if we would instead buy a particular perfume, preferred by a girl he liked, from the market. By the time I left Iraq after two tours, I harboured strong affection for the Iraqis. We tend now to think of Iraqis as a blur of people we came to liberate, but who have somehow morphed into faces in angry crowds, either tending their dead and wounded, or else cursing the West. But the Iraqis were the Scousers of the Arab world, and that is a compliment. They were funny, roguish and good at organising themselves. There was always an open door, often a spread of food in the humblest homesteads and hours to talk over coffee and beer. There was intensity about the outrages they endured, but what set the Iraqis apart was that survival instinct which thrives on a mischievous glint in the eye during times of tribulation. Almost everyone hated Saddam, but it was considered vulgar to talk about him, unless to tell Saddam jokes, mainly about incestuous sex with members of his family in Tikrit. Like the Poles I remember under communism, the Iraqis had gouged a space in which to live under tyranny. One kept one's head down, but not forever - if there's one lesson my generation learned in Eastern Europe, it is that tyrannies fall from within, not only because rebellions mobilise themselves, but because they do so out of this sense of mischief that made the Iraqis such an agreeable lot. I remember a row of parked cars on an artery leading out of the upmarket Mansur suburb of Baghdad, newspaper covering the windows. This was Lovers' Highway rather than Lovers' Lane, the cars occupied by young people doing what they could not do at home. I had only seen this in Naples, and was surprised, under a dictatorship in a Muslim country - but why should I have been? Indeed, I was reprimanded by my fixer for being so 'because you are jealous', he laughed. I wonder if Lovers' Highway is still there - probably not. In 2003, I was sent by this newspaper to find the intelligence colonel who had interrogated our colleague, Farzad Bazoft, executed by the Saddam regime in 1990. I found Kadem Askar, a former intelligence colonel who admitted he knew Farzad was innocent because his wife, on whom he had cheated, was sufficiently angry to locate him. There was a series of lunches with her family - Shia intellectuals - for the last of which one of her beautiful daughters changed from the usual black jihab into a sparkly purple one, with matching eye shadow, and chirped on about her favourite Iraqi and Western pop. Time came for a last goodbye, after weeks of regular hospitality, and it seemed a shame in my western mind that one simply cannot respectfully shake a lady's hand in such circumstances. But what the hell, I took the teenager's and kissed it, did the same to her mother's, waiting for the heavier hand of reproach at this silly offence. But everybody just burst out laughing. I wonder whether, if lunch at that gracious household were even possible now, they would laugh again. Football is the universal bond as well as tribal divider of mankind, and Iraq is the one most football-mad countries I have ever visited. At the end of the market in what is now called Sadr City, past men firing Kalashnikovs over one's car (now probably at it) is a spread of pitches, and boys playing. Afterwards, you can talk about any team in Europe to fans with a cosmopolitan command of detail unthinkable in Britain. I had come to learn this back in 1991. Each journalist was then allowed to submit one special request to Information Minister Tariq Aziz, and most entered an unrequited bid to interview Saddam. Not wanting to waste my coupon, I asked to go to a football match. I followed European soccer closely, and it was a relief after England to talk with my minder from the ministry about the innards of the Cup Winner's Cup semi-final between Juventus and Barcelona. At the end of the conversation, the minder, a Bayern fan, asked if I would petition the Home Office to help him escape to England, 'and I'm supposed to be the secret police watching you!' he laughed, demolishing a miniature of whisky. The game was between reigning champions Tayaran, the air force, against little-fancied Sulaikh, third from bottom. The fans waved little flags painted with Arabic script attached to wooden sticks, and the air force posse wore the only trendy haircuts in Baghdad, shaven at the back and sides, gel on top. There were hundreds of crop-headed waifs in robes, clinging to railings at the front, signalling toothlessly at each other and to players on the scrappy pitch. 'Arse-face! You may be tall but you're good for nothing,' chanted the lads in rhyme at off-form star Natik Hashim. After Sulaikh equalised: 'Air force heroes, you bring shame on all.', and when they realised there was a Briton in the stand, they chanted at me, confusingly at first: 'Gaza! Gaza!', meaning 'Gazza'. Just after the last war, in May 2003, I wrote an article for this newspaper about civilian casualties during the 'liberation' itself (markedly in Falluja) concluding: 'America and Britain have proclaimed their war in Iraq over and won, but wars, unlike football matches, do not end when the whistle blows. How I wish I'd been wrong. I managed to see the first post-war game, between Baghdad's al-Zawra and the Police Service (even though the country had no police then, it maintained a force football team). The huge portrait of Saddam I remember dominating the stadium in 1991 was blacked out. The waggish humour was still the same, only now politicised by a brand of religiosity I had never come across before the invasion. The star player, Saith Hussein, had explained that 'it was pretty frightening to play for Iraq because every mistake you made put you in prison'. Saddam's appalling son Uday would himself send goons to beat up offenders, but, explained Hussein, Uday's thugs were fans themselves, and would say: 'Look, scream a bit, while we beat the shit out of the furniture.' After the match, the crack of gunfire punched the dusk, but a husky little voice from around waist level demanded a say. It was a barefoot urchin called Haida Mohammed, with bright, puckish eyes. Which team did Haida support? As luck would have it for me, the answer was Juventus, my team, so we chatted, and his knowledge was flabbergasting. 'What's your dream for the future of Iraq?' I asked him. 'That I will play for Juventus,' he replied. 'How old are you?' I inquired. 'I don't know,' he answered. I wrote then that 'with fear and loathing of Saddam Hussein now redundant, you could say that football is the only force for cohesion, the only common language, in a now riven country'. And sure enough, last July, Iraq - 'The Lions of Mesopotamia' - won the Asia Cup with a team of Sunnis, Shias and Kurds. In defiance of the curfew, hundreds of thousands of people belonging to all three groups took to the streets to celebrate, firing bullets into the air, but not at each other. I think these were the only 24 hours since the invasion that no one was killed. Now that America's and Britain's vainglorious Iraqi enterprise has spiralled down into hell, just as my favourite building, the spiral mosque at Samarra, swirls heavenwards (though last time I beheld that glorious creation, its mystical magic was surrounded by Humvees and barbed wire). And I wonder whether that Iraqi vivacity in spite of all remains, or has been crushed. Now they have been 'liberated', do Iraqis laugh, love, entertain, make merry and mock the powers that be, as they did? I'm not sure the spread of meze, beer and coffee, and chatter about the Who, would be quite so forthcoming in Fallujah if I were to return tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
