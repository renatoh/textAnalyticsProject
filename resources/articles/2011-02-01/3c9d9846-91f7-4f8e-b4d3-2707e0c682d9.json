The England international, who scored the only goal in the first leg of their last-16 tie at San Siro on Tuesday night, said there is \"no limit to what we can achieve\" after Spurs vanquished the Serie A leaders without several key players. Spurs have now defeated Internazionale, the reigning champions, and their neighbours and seven-times winners of the competition, Milan, in the last three months, fuelling confidence within Redknapp's squad that they are capable of beating anyone in Europe. That their latest success came without the injured Gareth Bale and featured only a second-half cameo from Luka Modric, has further strengthened Tottenham's belief ahead of their second leg against Milan on 9 March. \"Gareth Bale and Luka Modric are top, top players and if we can come to the San Siro and win without them [in the starting line-up], then there's probably no limit to what we can achieve,\" said Crouch, who described scoring the winning goal against Milan as being \"right up there\" with his best moments in football. \"I don't think we have got anyone to fear. We've had a great comeback here last time against Inter [when Tottenham lost 4-3 after being 4-0 behind at half-time and down to 10 men], we beat Inter at home, we have come away from home \u2013 which was a fantastic test for us \u2013 and to win in Milan, hopefully people will start believing that we can do something in this competition.\" Tottenham executed their gameplan to perfection. Redknapp's side looked dangerous on the counterattack throughout but they were also disciplined without the ball, with Wilson Palacios and the young Brazilian Sandro assuaging any fears that their presence in central midfield might be an area of weakness for Milan to exploit. A goalless draw at White Hart Lane will now be enough to see Spurs through to the quarter-finals although playing for that result is not in the team's DNA. Crouch anticipates Redknapp's instructions in the second leg will be to adopt the same high-tempo approach that has produced convincing victories in all four European home matches this season. \"I think it will be an open game,\" he said. \"We'll attack. I don't think we will go and defend our lead because that's not our style. I think we'll go to White Hart Lane and attack them and try and score goals and try to put the game to bed as early as possible. It will be a great atmosphere.\" History is on Tottenham's side. Although 22 teams have gone through in the knockout stages of the Champions League after losing the first leg, Ajax are the only side who have managed to do so after being defeated at home. With Bale and Modric both expected to be fully fit for the second leg, and Milan without their suspended captain, Gennaro Gattuso, the odds are stacked in Tottenham's favour, although Redknapp's players refuse to view progress into the last eight as a formality. \"It was a great night for us, the club and for the fans, but the job is not yet done,\" said the Spurs goalkeeper, Heurelho Gomes, who produced two outstanding second-half saves to deny Mario Yepes. \"It is not yet finished. We are halfway there. Maybe now we are unstoppable but we know how Milan play and how they have experience in their squad. Up front they have a lot of quality players. We need to be careful and we need to finish the job at White Hart Lane.\" Ends"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
