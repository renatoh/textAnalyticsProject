Even as key Republican senators acknowledged Trump\u2019s guilt on charges of abusing power and obstructing Congress, they defied public opinion on Friday by voting to block witnesses and documents, paving the way for the president to be acquitted and claim exoneration. Republican fealty to Trump has long wearied liberals but the senators\u2019 move appeared to cause a new level of anger. The Indivisible Project, a progressive group, announced it would target nine senators, among them majority leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Trump loyalist Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, in November\u2019s elections. Indivisible said it would next week call out one of the \u201cnine Payback Project senators for their participating in a coverup by placing a full page newspaper ad in one of their biggest state papers\u201d. In an appeal to activists, it said \u201crage is good for recruiting. Hello. Are you pissed about impeachment too?\u201d Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in December, for seeking to coerce a foreign government for his own personal political gain. Two articles of impeachment \u2013 abuse of power and obstruction of Congress \u2013 were transferred to the Senate for trial. But on Friday the Senate failed to allow documents and new witnesses including the former national security adviser John Bolton, who in an upcoming book accuses the president of making military aid to Ukraine conditional on an investigation into his rival Joe Biden. Every impeachment trial in US history, including the two that featured presidents, allowed documents and witnesses. But only two Republicans voted in favour: Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah. Some said they did not think Trump did anything wrong. Others went through extraordinary contortions. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Rob Portman of Ohio reasoned that Trump\u2019s actions were wrong but not impeachable. In an interview with NBC\u2019s Meet the Press due to be broadcast on Sunday, Alexander said: \u201cIf you have eight witnesses who say someone left the scene of an accident, why do you need nine? I mean, the question for me was: do I need more evidence to conclude that the president did what he did? And I concluded no.\u201d Alexander told the New York Times why that was not enough to require Trump\u2019s removal: \u201cThe Senate reflects the country, and the country is as divided as it has been for a long time. For the Senate to tear up the ballots in this election and say President Trump couldn\u2019t be on it, the country probably wouldn\u2019t accept that. It would just pour gasoline on cultural fires that are burning out there.\u201d In a stunning Medium post, Marco Rubio of Florida, humiliated by Trump in the 2016 primary, went even further, arguing that impeachment would be too divisive even if a president engaged in clearly impeachable conduct. \u201cJust because actions meet a standard of impeachment does not mean it is in the best interest of the country to remove a president from office,\u201d he wrote. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a moderate who Democrats courted, said the case was rushed and flawed. She told reporters she was \u201cangry at all sides\u201d and the prospect of a tie vote on witnesses weighed on her decision. She also said she knew how she would vote on the charges but: \u201cWill I share it with you tonight? I\u2019ve had so much drama today, I\u2019m just going to chill. How\u2019s that? Was that fair?\u201d Trump\u2019s takeover of the Republican party appears complete. On Saturday the widely read Politico Playbook commented: \u201cHere\u2019s the truth: Republicans are not comfortable with the president\u2019s behavior. They say it privately, some say it publicly on their way out. \u201cBut they have no incentive to say this aloud no matter how egregious they believe the president\u2019s behavior to be. To win as a Republican in any seat that\u2019s at all marginal, you need to appeal to Republicans to vote.\u201d Republicans who break from Trump can face a bitter backlash. Matt Schlapp, the chair of the American Conservative Union, announced on Twitter that Romney was \u201cformally NOT invited\u201d to the influential Conservative Political Action Conference. Democrats will seek to make Republicans pay in November, as they did in the 2018 midterms when victory in the House made impeachment possible. Under the headline, \u201cHow impeachment could flip the Senate\u201d, Rahm Emanuel, a former White House chief of staff, wrote in the Washington Post that \u201cimpeachment is likely to have an outsize impact\u201d and every Republican senator will \u201cown Trump\u2019s emboldened rhetoric of being exonerated\u201d. He added: \u201cSome 63% of voters in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina look unfavourably on the Senate\u2019s decision \u2026 to disallow witnesses and hide documents... That may partly explain why the five Republican senators are \u2018underwater\u2019, meaning more constituents view them negatively than positively.\u201d The trial will resume on Monday for final arguments. That evening, Trump is sure to cruise to victory in the Iowa caucuses while Democrats battle for the right to challenge him. The president will deliver his state of the union address on Tuesday and is set to be acquitted by the Senate on the following day. As he did after special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, Trump is expected to falsely claim \u201ctotal exoneration\u201d and that Democrats seek to overturn the last election. In turn, Democrats will warn that the president will solicit foreign interference again. David Axelrod, a former chief strategist for Barack Obama, suggested the trial could inflict lasting damage. \u201cFor Trump, this trial is going to end swiftly, as he hoped,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cBut it\u2019s not ending well. Far from vindication, even some who oppose his removal, acknowledge his guilt. And the conspicuous avoidance of material witnesses like Bolton casts an inescapable shadow.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
