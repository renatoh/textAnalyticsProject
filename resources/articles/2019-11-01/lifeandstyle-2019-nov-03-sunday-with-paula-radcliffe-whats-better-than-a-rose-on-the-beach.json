Rarely. Sunday is marathon day. As a kid I\u2019d be racing at the track; as a professional it\u2019s the day I\u2019d compete. Now I\u2019m often at events as an ambassador or to commentate \u2013 last Sunday in Chicago, I was up at 5am. What about days off? I stay in bed as along as possible, or until my nine-year-old decides I\u2019ve had enough sleep. Sunday breakfast is pancakes, we make them together, and then I\u2019ll head out for a run. That\u2019s when I have space to think. How do you relax? We live in Monaco, so on the beach with kayaks in the summer. Antibes is beautiful and not too far away. When it\u2019s colder we might head to the mountains and ski, or I\u2019ll stay at home with my daughter, who loves to bake. Do you ever have the day to yourself? Never happens, and I\u2019d be lost. I suppose I\u2019d potter in the garden and do jobs around the house, then sprawl on the sofa and open my book. Right now that\u2019s James Patterson\u2019s 19th Christmas. It\u2019s easy reading, and I like the suspense. The best Sunday lunch? At home with friends. I\u2019m not one for traditional Sunday roasts \u2013 my cooking is quick and healthy: salmon, salads and stir fries. The rule is nothing that takes longer than half an hour. Do you drink? Yes, though that\u2019s not limited to Sundays. There are so many French vineyards on our doorstep \u2013 and what\u2019s better than a chilled ros\u00e9 on the beach? A special Sunday? Marathons, again. I set both of my world records on Sunday, but I\u2019ll never forget the London race day in 1985. I was waiting to cheer my dad on at the side of the road, aged 11, when Ingrid Kristiansen \u2013 in the middle of breaking her world record \u2013 came running past. It was inspirational to witness, such a special moment.
