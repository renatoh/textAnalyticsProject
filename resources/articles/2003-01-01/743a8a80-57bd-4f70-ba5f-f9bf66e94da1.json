Jim Krewson and Jennie Benford are at the helm of the loose-knit Pinetops line-up (banjo, fiddle and string bass to the fore); they write most of the songs and share the vocals between them. Their raw voices burrow deep into the unfathomable mystery that gives this music its force. Although no one in the band has an ancestral mountain-music name like Scruggs, Watson or Monroe, their all-original songs fit into the great tradition with uncanny ease. The title tune howls like an Appalachian coyote, and you'd swear My Grey and Fading Dreams must be in the Louvin Brothers' catalogue somewhere. Hoedown!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
