While Blair remains on course for a majority after 7 June, the election in Northern Ireland will be a close-run thing. And in the balance hang the fortunes of the Province's First Minister, David Trimble, and the future of the peace deal signed on Good Friday, 1998. Blair's pledges to ratify the Good Friday Agreement have come back to haunt him and unionist politicians who took him at face value. Blair, once Trimble's greatest asset, is now his biggest liability. Even on the Merville estate, an upwardly mobile loyalist area of working to lower middle class, just north of Belfast's shoreline, Blair would endure a far rougher ride than he received last week at the hands of Sharron Storer outside Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital. During the May 1998 campaign, Blair unveiled a series of handwritten promises aimed at shoring up the Ulster Unionist leader and reassuring a sceptical unionist electorate about the necessity of the peace deal with the IRA and its political wing. Among Blair's five-point contract with Ulster's Protestants were assurances that 'those who used or threatened violence would be excluded from the government of Northern Ireland' and 'prisoners would not be freed unless violence was given up for good'. The Prime Minister helped give the Yes vote a small unionist majority in favour of the peace deal. Just over three years later there is a widespread perception among Protestants that Blair has let them down. Tapping into resentment over the IRA's refusal to dispose of the largest terrorist arsenal in the Western world and the ongoing violence committed by all paramilitary forces is Nigel Dodds, the champion for Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist Party in North Belfast. Bounding up avenues lined with blossoming cherry trees last Thursday, Dodds was treading on what should have been natural Ulster Unionist territory. The 40-year-old lawyer, educated at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen whose old boys include Samuel Beckett and Oscar Wilde, is not the stereotypical DUP representative that rages on about hellfire, damnation and line-dancing. A double first from Cambridge, Dodds is able to appeal to unionism's floating voter, the type that believed Blair three years ago and reluctantly voted Yes. 'There are people who voted Yes to the agreement who are supporting me this time,' the energetic Dodds predicted. One resident told him: 'I've always supported the Ulster Unionists, but I'm giving you my vote this time, Nigel. Tony Blair lied to us. The IRA have kept their guns, got their prisoners out of jail and continue their violence.' It is a mantra repeated by others who welcomed Dodds from their immaculate whitewashed houses. North Belfast is a must-win seat for Paisley and his party. The DUP predicts it can take three seats from the UUP and become the largest unionist party. For its supporters it is a second chance to ditch the Agreement. Defending the seat for the UUP is Cecil Walker, a genial, hard-of-hearing pensioner. Walker said his record and the 'negativity' of the DUP would let him hold the seat. 'David Trimble got devolution. If the DUP got their way, power would go back to London. The DUP have no realistic alternative,' he said. Tactical voting is another big theme. Last weekend in The Observer, Trimble appealed to middle-class Catholics and non-aligned liberal Protestants to support his candidates where they face a strong DUP challenge. A slight shift in voting patterns in areas like North Down and Strangford might save one seat for Trimble and gain his party another. Enough probably to save his leadership until the 1 July deadline for the IRA to begin decommissioning arms. In North Belfast, however, a double war is being waged. In the Ballysillan estate the struggle between loyalists is fought with bullets. The pro-Agreement Ulster Volunteer Force is engaged in a murderous feud with the anti-Agreement Loyalist Volunteer Force. Ominously for Trimble, the UVF and its political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, refuse to take sides in the political war. The irony is that, had the DUP sunk the Agreement three years ago, most of these men would have remained in the Maze prison. Now some of those who benefited most from a peace deal that the DUP seeks to destroy are willing to vote for Nigel Dodds.
