It happened in 1981, seven years before he was born, though Liverpool did manage something by way of compensation that season in the form of their third European Cup. That scenario may well repeat itself this season \u2013 both clubs failing to make the top four, that is, not one being crowned champions of Europe \u2013 though Lallana believes Liverpool could still finish in the Champions League positions, and he would like them to use Sunday\u2019s game against United at Anfield as a springboard. \u201cThis was always going to be a big week for us and if we can get three points from the next game I would say it has been a successful one,\u201d Lallana argues. \u201cWe played so well against Arsenal we were a bit disappointed to only get one point, but if we can beat United it puts us right back in the mix. \u201cThe results went our way to an extent in the week but even so, the draw against Arsenal felt like two points dropped. It would have been even more disappointing had we not taken anything from the game, though. A point was the least we deserved. We could have lost and that would have been a massive sucker punch after letting them back into the game. We need to take our momentum and confidence into the United game, because it feels like we keep getting within touching distance of the top four and then taking a step back. \u201cWe need to be more consistent to pick up wins, that\u2019s how you find yourself in the top four. Plus United beat us twice last season and we didn\u2019t put in a great performance at Old Trafford in September, so we definitely owe them one.\u201d The dismal 3-1 defeat in Manchester was one of Brendan Rodgers\u2019s last games in charge. Indeed, many felt the insipid performance was instrumental in convincing the club hierarchy that change was necessary. J\u00fcrgen Klopp arrived with some fanfare in October, and though Lallana is right to suggest progress since has been stop-start rather than smoothly upwards, the one thing Liverpool can point to with some pride is their record against the bigger clubs this season. Chelsea and Manchester City were comprehensively outplayed at their own grounds, and Liverpool managed to raise their game to match Arsenal despite losing several key players to injury. \u201cWe\u2019ve done well against the big teams this year. We\u2019d like to keep that going and especially against United,\u201d Lallana says. \u201cThis is an opportunity we need to take. It is going to be a huge game, a great atmosphere, and that normally brings out the best in us.\u201d True enough, though it could be pointed out that ninth in the table versus sixth does not sound like a meeting of giants. It is quite hard to spot the big clubs this season \u2013 do Chelsea still count? \u2013 and normally the interest in north-west derbies lies in the possibility of one side denying the other the title. Liverpool and Manchester United remain big names, though you would have to consult the history books rather than the league table to understand why the derby continues to be invested with significance by participants and spectators. \u201cThis is always going to be one of the big fixtures. I think even the gaffer appreciates that and he has not been involved in the rivalry before,\u201d Lallana says. \u201cBut the days of big teams dominating the league seem to be coming to an end. You can\u2019t predict the top four any more. Any team seems capable of beating any other, and I don\u2019t think you are going to see just two or three teams running away with it, as has happened in the past. \u201cA number of teams look capable of winning the league, and that\u2019s got to be a strength. If you ask me it\u2019s the strongest league in the world at the moment, because games are just so hard to predict. Look at Leicester, people were writing them off after our result against them, everyone thought they would dip, but they got a great result at Tottenham the other night and it makes the whole top four battle very interesting. It\u2019s great for the spectators that there are so many teams in contention at the top of the league.\u201d An early poster boy for the extra running required under the Klopp regime, after he collapsed photogenically into his manager\u2019s arms at the end of the game at Tottenham, Lallana has not only recovered from exhaustion but managed to avoid the hamstring problems that have hampered so many of his team-mates this season. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously, we have had a few injuries of late but it shows you the levels the players are working at. Maybe it has been a bit of a shock to the body and some bodies are still adjusting, but it has also been an intense period over Christmas and other clubs have suffered with injuries, too. The important thing is that we are still in every competition and we still have players to come back.\u201d The rate at which Klopp was moving up and down the Anfield touchline during the Arsenal game suggested the next hamstring failure might be a managerial one, but the German\u2019s demonstrative nature and physical style seems to endear him to his players. \u201cHe\u2019s a warm character, very affectionate and emotional,\u201d Lallana says. \u201cQuite often you get a bear hug if you have done well and that\u2019s nice. It shows he appreciates the work you are doing. When a new manager comes into a club it\u2019s almost like that first day at school feeling. You want to impress, show what you can do, prove yourself all over again. But the gaffer\u2019s been great, not just for me, but for everyone. \u201cThere won\u2019t be too many who have anything bad to say about him, even if he can be quite intense at times. I\u2019m sure you have seen it on the sidelines when he is screaming at us. He says he prefers not to scream but then finds himself getting completely involved in the game. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve seen him lose his temper, but if he\u2019s not happy with something, let\u2019s say something that\u2019s happening repeatedly on the pitch, he can become quite a bit more vocal.\u201d That is clearly a euphemism, though it would be unfair to press Lallana any further. What goes on between a coach and his players in private ought to remain private. If Klopp ever goes in for the old hairdryer treatment, or in his case haartrockner behandlung, Lallana is not about to spill the beans. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you that,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s just say he\u2019s quite emotional and passionate about us doing well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
