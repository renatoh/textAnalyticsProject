It might be kind to make the bed, but don't be tempted to help with the unpacking. As soon as we meet someone, get back in the car and go. Leave us to meet the people we'll be living with. \u2022 Don't visit: Unless you're invited to, don't come to see us in the first term. It's our time to meet new people and settle in and, honestly, the local costume museum is not that riveting. But if you want to forward me the money it would have cost instead \u2026 \u2022 Do send food parcels: Receiving a parcel is always exciting, but when it contains treats we will suddenly find ourselves the most popular person on the corridor. \u2022 Don't ask us to come home: If you miss us or feel lonely, get a hobby. Don't make us feel guilty about you. You always said you wished your parents had let you have piano lessons \u2013 well, now's your chance. \u2022 Don't phone before 10am: Recognise that an early call will not go down well. Ideally, steer clear until the afternoon \u2013 any day of the week. \u2022 Don't inspect the toilet: When you collect us at the end of a term, look past the dirt. This is our territory, not yours, and the dirty sink hasn't killed us yet. \u2022 Don't go on about when you were at university: Accept that it was 30 years ago and things have changed. Given the amount of debt we're racking up, we don't want to hear about your rent strikes. And no, I don't want your Che Guevara poster, thank you. \u2022 Do take an interest: Remember to show support and call the day before a deadline or exam, but offering to come clubbing to celebrate will probably not be appropriate. And please don't Facebook-stalk our friends. \u2022 Don't exclude us: Just because we're not living at home doesn't mean we're not still interested in giving you the pleasure of our company on the family holiday. A beach in the sun would be nice. \u2022 Welcome a new relationship: We're not your babies any more, but that doesn't need to be negative. We're pleased the teenager/parent years are over and really looking forward to having you more as a friend. But, no, you still can't come clubbing. To my parents: I am not accusing you of all the above, at least not all at the same time. And to all student parents: we do still need you, even if we don't always let you know. Though failure to adhere to the above tips might strain that. John Crace \u2022 Don't think your acting tough fools us: We know it's a big deal for you to be leaving home. It is for us too. If it's any comfort, I'll be sobbing most of the way down the M6. Not so sure about your mother, though. \u2022 Don't complain when we get a dog: I know we said there was never a right time to get a dog. Well, it turns out there was and it was the week after you left home. We've never had someone in the house before who is thrilled to see us every morning without fail, and we rather like it. \u2022 Don't ring us to say how much work you've got on: It may feel like a human rights violation that you have one essay to do each week, but we'd kill to have such a slack timetable. You probably hadn't noticed, but we've both been working 12-hour days for the past few years. \u2022 Do excuse the odd snigger: It must be terribly difficult for you that there are a couple of students in your flat who never lift a finger and leave their stuff all over the place, but we can't help thinking it's poetic justice. My life has been transformed by not having to beg you to pick the wet towels off your bedroom floor. \u2022 Do still come with us on holiday: But please don't go on and on about what a favour you are doing us. We'd miss you a great deal if you didn't come, but we can't remember you offering to pay your own way. Or do any of the cooking, for that matter. \u2022 Don't treat us as if we're stupid: You are very bright and you are studying a subject we know little about, but that doesn't mean we've turned into total morons overnight. Don't forget that I still thrash you at University Challenge every time. \u2022 Do let us visit from time to time: Try to accept that we do miss you and being missed doesn't make you any less grown up. We really don't want to take over your life \u2013 well, I certainly don't; we just want to keep in touch. Especially on days when Spurs are playing an away game near you. \u2022 Don't go mad when you find everything isn't exactly as you left it when you come home: Hard to believe, I'm sure, but we haven't converted your bedroom into a shrine. And yes, I have deleted 12 episodes of the Kardashians from the Sky+ box, not because we were running out of space on the hard drive, but because you weren't here to stop me. \u2022 Don't spend so long on Facebook: It's such a waste of time and just because you're living 200 miles away, it doesn't mean that your brother isn't stalking you and grassing you up to us. \u2022 Don't take this the wrong way, but we actually much prefer you now you're at university. Not that we haven't always loved you, but you were pretty boring as a toddler and very grumpy as a teenager. Now you're human.
