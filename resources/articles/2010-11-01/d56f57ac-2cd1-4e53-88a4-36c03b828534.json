But Dillon's home city of Glasgow has finally succeeded where others failed, by marking the composer's 60th birthday with the long-delayed premiere. With three conductors, the BBC Singers and Scottish Symphony Orchestra, Les Percussions de Strasbourg and multiple sound projectionists and engineers, it was an immense occasion, unquestionably the most significant new-music event in Britain this year. The pieces that make up Nine Rivers can all be performed independently. When heard in the context of the whole, though, their connections become much clearer. Dillon's starting point was the poetry of Rimbaud \u2013 quotations from Le Bateau Ivre head each movement \u2013 but references to alchemy and to the two meanings of the word \"river\" are woven into the allusions, too. Residues of the unpitched percussion of the opening East 11th St NY 10003 provide an aural thread through the first four pieces; the last four are connected by haloes of electronic sound, with the central La Coupure standing apart, twice as long as any of the others, and made up of discrete musical objects rather than the dense, ever evolving layers of the material elsewhere. The cumulative power of it all is massive, the range of musical experience vast. There's the weightless hyperactivity of the six solo violins in the second movement, L'ECRAN parfum; the bleak horrors of the sixth, L'Oeuvre au Noir; and the Wagnerian grandeur of the last, Oceanos, which Dillon calls the \"delta\" of the piece, with its 16 voices embedded in swathes of electronics and orchestral textures constantly threatened by heavy brass. Quite extraordinary. \u2022 Broadcast on Radio 3 on 11 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
