Chesa Boudin\u2019s parents were members of the far-left, anti-Vietnam war Weather Underground, which was active in the 1960s and 70s. His mother, Kathy Boudin, survived an infamous explosion in Greenwich Village, New York City, in March 1970, when members of the group accidentally detonated a bomb intended for an army ball in New Jersey. She and her husband, David Gilbert, were sent to prison when Chesa was an infant, for their role in an armed heist in New York in 1981 in which three people were killed by members of the Black Liberation Army. Kathy Boudin was released in 2003. Gilbert remains in jail. Boudin, 39, has said growing up with incarcerated parents motivated him to study law and reform the criminal justice system. In 2002, the Yale grad and Rhodes scholar told the Guardian: \u201cGrowing up in a household where people have a political consciousness, where people think and care deeply about political issues has an impact on you.\u201d He was raised by two other well-known Weathermen, Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn. \u201cMy parents are all people who have taken a stand for what they believe in over and over again,\u201d he said 17 years ago. \u201cThat to me is a fine example \u2013 even if I disagreed with some of their choices.\u201d In a campaign video this year, he said: \u201cGrowing up, I had to go through a metal detector and steel gates just to give my parents a hug.\u201d After college, Boudin had a spell working as a translator for Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the late president of Venezuela. On Saturday night in San Francisco, he declared victory after four days of ballot-counting determined he was ahead of Suzy Loftus. Results from the San Francisco department of elections gave Boudin victory by 2,825 votes. Loftus, the interim district attorney, said she would work to ensure a smooth transition. Loftus was appointed by Mayor London Breed last month, after George Gascon announced he was resigning and moving to Los Angeles to explore a run for DA there. Loftus was endorsed by the Democratic establishment, including California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, and the US senators Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, for whom she worked when Harris was San Francisco DA. \u201cSan Francisco has always been supportive of a progressive approach to criminal justice,\u201d Harris said on Sunday while campaigning in Iowa for the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of that town and I congratulate the winner.\u201d Boudin received high-profile support from the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and the writer and civil rights activist Shaun King. Congratulating Boudin, Sanders tweeted: \u201cNow is the moment to fundamentally transform our racist and broken criminal justice system by ending mass incarceration, the failed war on drugs and the criminalization of poverty.\u201d Boudin is the latest candidate across the US to win district attorney elections by pushing for sweeping reform of incarceration policies. In a statement on his win, he said he wanted to tackle racial bias in the criminal justice system, overhaul the bail system, protect immigrants from deportation and pursue accountability in police misconduct cases. \u201cThe people of San Francisco have sent a powerful and clear message,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for radical change to how we envision justice. I\u2019m humbled to be a part of this movement that is unwavering in its demand for transformation.\u201d This article was amended on 11 November 2019. It originally said Boudin was ahead by 8,465 votes. In fact, his final margin of victory was 2,825. It was further amended on 13 November 2019 to correct a misspelling of Chesa Boudin\u2019s first name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
