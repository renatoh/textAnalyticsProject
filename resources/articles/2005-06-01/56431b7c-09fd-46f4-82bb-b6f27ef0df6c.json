It is both smaller and lighter than its equivalent 20GB iPod, and unlike the Apple player, it is compatible with Windows Media Audio (WMA) as well as MP3 and ATRAC files. It is also a bit cheaper, at \u00a3200. Its main advantage over the iPod, however, is its battery, which runs for 40 hours if using ATRAC, and just less than 30 if using MP3. The NW-HD5 also boasts a couple of new facilities: a large display that works in landscape or portrait mode, and a menu option that lets users see the tracks most recently transferred to the device. The sound quality is exceptional for a hard disk player. However, while its large, slightly recessed buttons are simple to use, they are not as fast or as accurate as Apple's superb scroll wheel. Apple also still has two ace cards: its intuitive iTunes software, and its popular online music store. But as for the hardware, this device just about gives Sony the edge. www.sony.co.uk \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Online, send your emails to online.feedback@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
