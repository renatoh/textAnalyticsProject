The loyalist sighs. He still wants the prime minister to win the election. \u201cIt\u2019s all mixed up at the moment.\u201d When the contradictions become too much and his head throbs from the paradoxes, Matthews, 76, a retired painter from Holywood, Co Down, retreats into meditative silence. \u201cI turn off the radio.\u201d He is not alone. This Brexit election has swivelled the usual political signposts for unionists, nationalists and non-aligned voters. Remainers have reason to back Brexiters, nationalists have reason to cheer Tories, and unionists have reason to hope Jeremy Corbyn, a Sinn F\u00e9in sympathiser, ends up in Downing Street. Northern Ireland has passed through the looking glass into a campaign where voters are asked to believe as many as six impossible things before breakfast. The election is a combustible cocktail that combines questions about the region\u2019s constitutional status with economic uncertainty, tribal allegiance, tactical voting, profound weariness and widespread confusion. \u201cI consider myself a socialist but I\u2019d probably want Boris Johnson to win,\u201d said Billy, a 56-year-old Belfast punk rocker. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d say that. But that\u2019s the effect of being here, that\u2019s Northern Ireland.\u201d Voters in England face dilemmas in choosing between Labour, the Tories, the Liberal Democrats and Brexit party, but they are spared counter-intuitive imponderables that confront Northern Ireland voters. Sinn F\u00e9in opposes Brexit but it is holding a conference in Derry this weekend amid the giddy prospect of a victorious Tory PM ramming through a deal that advances republican goals. \u201cWhat Johnson proposes in terms of an all-Ireland economy arguably advances the cause of Irish unity more effectively than the abstention, armed struggle and episodic participation which have characterised republican tactics over the years,\u201d Jon Tonge, a political analyst, wrote in the Belfast Telegraph. \u201cAll-Ireland regulation of goods? Tick. An All-Ireland customs regime, even if Northern Ireland formally remains with the UK\u2019s? Tick. Goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland treated as exports not internal trade, if likely to head onwards to the EU? Tick. Unionists apoplectic about what they see as the marginalisation of Northern Ireland within the UK? Tick.\u201d Nationalist parties have agreed an electoral pact under a pro-Remain banner that will prove hard for some people to swallow. By standing aside in Belfast North to boost Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s chances \u2013 and obtain a quid pro quo in Belfast South \u2013 the SDLP is asking supporters to set aside their scorn for Sinn F\u00e9in and its policy of abstention. Unionist Brexiters face even sharper quandaries. Do they accept Johnson\u2019s assurances \u2013 and those of some business leaders \u2013 that the deal would be an economic boon and barely tinker with the union? If so do they vote against the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which wants to kill the deal, and with it perhaps Brexit\u2019s last hope? George Chittick, 76, a retired civil servant, is torn. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting out of Europe. It\u2019s a corrupt regime.\u201d A deal that weakens the union would be a steep price, said Chittick. \u201cIf Boris Johnson does the dirty on us we\u2019ll do the dirty on him.\u201d But Chittick worries more about Corbyn winning power. \u201cIt has to be the Tories. If that means Boris\u2019s deal, so be it.\u201d A hung parliament could restore DUP leverage at Westminster while presenting an acute predicament. Try to patch relations with Johnson, who threw the DUP under the bus, in hope of negotiating a new deal? The resulting imbroglio could torpedo Brexit \u2013 which gives Remainers reason to roll the dice with the DUP. Or it could lead to a no-deal crash-out that wreaks havoc on Northern Ireland. Or should the DUP support a Labour leader branded by many unionists as an IRA fellow traveller? Logic points to Corbyn, Newton Emerson, a unionist commentator, wrote in the Irish Times. \u201cLabour \u2026 is promising to negotiate a soft Brexit withdrawal agreement that would solve the DUP\u2019s sea-border problem, followed by a second EU referendum that could solve all the DUP\u2019s Brexit problems.\u201d The party\u2019s first election broadcast in Northern Ireland, aired last week, resolved the contradictions by making not a single reference to Brexit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
