In a peculiar moment of theatre yesterday Brigadier-General Vince Brooks, the deputy director of operations at central command in Qatar, held up one of the decks of cards in front of television cameras but refused to name the 55 suspects. \"There are jokers in the pack, there is no doubt about that,\" he said. The ace of spades is marked with a photograph of Saddam Hussein, while his younger son Qusay appears on the ace of clubs. American officials have tried to insist the war in Iraq is not about targeting individuals but removing the regime as a whole. Yesterday, however, it became clear that the 55 individual Iraqi leaders were indeed being hunted down. Despite the immense firepower the US military has brought to Iraq, their troops have failed to capture a single top-ranking leader. \"They are either dead or running like hell,\" General Tommy Franks, the commander of the US-led operation, said yesterday. Only one regime figure appears to have been killed - Ali Hassan al-Majid, the general otherwise known as Chemical Ali - whose body was reportedly found in the rubble of his home after a US air strike. Yesterday US warplanes destroyed the home of another senior Iraqi, Barazan Ibrahim al-Tikriti - Saddam Hussein's half-brother - in the town of Ramad, west of Baghdad. One report quoting his family said he had died when six JDAM bombs destroyed his house early yesterday morning. Central command described him as a \"regime presidential adviser\" but he was also a former head of the secret police. Other Iraqis likely to be in the pack of cards are deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz, and vice-president Taha Yassin Ramadan, and the revolutionary command council vice-chairman, Izzat Ibrahim. \"All our efforts are not focused on pursuing any one individual,\" Gen Brooks said yesterday. But he added: \"We have also been consistent in saying that we are after removing the regime and that means taking away its capabilities, taking away its decision makers. We consider them all to be legitimate military targets.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
