He'd journeyed to the top of the mountain - or the Trellick Tower, at least - and he'd returned with reports not so much of a promised land, more a future imperfect. The collision of celebrity and violence, global warming - he'd been there, seen it and got next season's T-shirt while everyone else was still in loon pants. His was always a floridly car-centric future, too - particularly in the Heathrow area. I've read Crash. The sage of Shepperton's greatest novel did for the airport's slip roads and dual carriageway arterials what Dickens did for Victorian London. So what was I doing on a train tonning it up to Heathrow? Ballard's sketches of our future unconscious never included the 100mph Heathrow Express, eight gunmetal-grey and Trafalgar-blue carriages, whooshing me from Paddington to Terminal 1 in 15 minutes. Ballard's vision of the airport itself has come to pass. Terminals 1-4 are the slowly cohering centre of a future city, one with everything but housing. Unless you count the hotels, that is. But his other vision of Heathrow, as the hub of a great automobilic civilisation, has slipped below the horizon. Most passengers still arrive there by car, but they do it like smokers, furtively and taxed. There's a public transport levy on every car-park ticket and the Prescott-sponsored bus lane is black and proud, if mostly empty. Heathrow's overlords like to point out that the airport contains the UK's busiest bus station. And they like to swank about Heathrow Express. Justifiably. I've used it a lot and it's hard to fault. It's fast, clean, smooth, well-staffed, reliable and constantly being upgraded - extra coaches now, new lines and a T5 extension in the future. So let's list those faults. The MTV Hits channel has its place in the world, but it's in the gym, not on the Heathrow Express video monitors. There are no on-train loos - arriving at Heathrow, the nearest is a good five minutes' walk. And the first-class carriages are covered in advertising, sponsored like some dodgy polo tournament. First class on Heathrow Express is a pig's arse altogether, actually. Its operators intended it to be one class only. But the airlines shuddered at the thought of their first-class passengers being asked to finish their journey to central London in the company of Mr Hoi and Mrs Polloi. They insisted on a two-class system. And while the first-class carriages might be more luxurious, they're decidedly uglier. It's pricey, too. A one-way ticket is \u00a313 - or 1.44p a second. First class is \u00a325 - 2.8p a second. There's profit in there, of course, about \u00a32 per ticket. At that rate, the original \u00a3450m investment could well be paid back by, oh, 2050. So far as I know, London's other major airport, Gatwick, has never featured in Ballard's future visions. But it did in mine. As Sussex Downs' teenagers, we'd drive there in the middle of the night, partly because it embodied escape, speed and unfettered possibilities, but also because it was the only place open for a coffee. Even then, Gatwick's glamour was more tempered by daily realities than its older, more urbane sister, Heathrow. Which is partly why it got into public transport earlier - it's always been more concerned with the coach party than the carriage trade. It was built with an integral mainline rail link - the first airport in the world to have one. Gatwick Express has been running since 1984 and is now joined at the marketing hip - as Airport Express - with the Heathrow and Stansted links. It leaves from Victoria, where its company colours, red and yellow, make it a little hard to pick out from the adjacent Burger King. After years of using a ragbag of BR cast-offs, Gatwick Express now has some shiny new train sets. The switchover has been one of the great privatisation fiascos. Simply, the trains didn't work, in all kinds of ways. It wasn't Gatwick Express's fault, but it was its problem. Some of the problems have been fixed - both my jaunts arrived five minutes early. Some haven't. There are still creaks and squeaks - though maybe that's the track's fault. There are also stains and chewing gum on the carpet - though I doubt that's the company's fault either. While Heathrow Express is essentially a luxe, urban rapid transit system, Gatwick Express is a kind of inter-city lite. So its carriages have the extras needed for the longer, 30-minute trip - loos, more tables, more comfortable seats and a snack trolley. As you'd expect, Gatwick Express is cheaper (\u00a311 express class, \u00a318 first class) and tries harder. Onboard announcements are in five languages, shaming Heathrow Express's anglocentric monoglotism. Paul Costelloe designed the staff uniforms. And there's a giant Gatwick Express logo on the roof of each train. Essential, I guess, if one ran wild and had to be tracked down by helicopter-borne police marksmen. To disinter and muck around with an old clich\u00e9: I have seen the future of public transport and it works, though at a price. If all trains were this good, the roads would empty overnight. Which would be quite marvellous. All the more room for me, JG Ballard and our cars."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
