The country\u2019s human rights record has been described by Amnesty International as \u201cheinous\u201d and it and Human Rights Watch have characterised the event as a blatant attempt at sportswashing to legitimise the country\u2019s repressive regime. The night race is set to take place on a street circuit in Jeddah as the penultimate meeting of the season. It is believed the deal with Saudi Arabia will last 10 years, with the intent to begin racing on a purpose-built circuit outside Riyadh in 2023. Minky Worden, the Human Rights Watch director overseeing sport, was unequivocal in condemning the decision. \u201cSporting bodies like Formula One and the FIA cannot ignore the fact they and fans are being used for sportswashing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is part of a cynical strategy to distract from Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights abuses, detention and torture of human rights defenders and women\u2019s rights activists. \u201cFormula One has made human rights commitments, and should explain how the company\u2019s operations will improve human rights in Saudi Arabia. Have F1 staff used their negotiations with Saudi leaders to advocate for the release of women\u2019s rights activists whose only crime was advocating for the right to drive? Fans, media and race teams should use this moment to say their sport should not be associated with such serious human rights abuses.\u201d F1 made a public commitment to equality this year, launching its \u201cwe race as one\u201d initiative to promote inclusivity and diversity across race, gender and sexuality within the sport. However, in November last year Amnesty condemned an announcement issued by Saudi Arabia\u2019s state security agency categorising feminism, homosexuality and atheism as \u201cextremist ideas\u201d. Amnesty\u2019s Middle East and North Africa director, Heba Morayef, cited it as a clear indication of the true nature of the regime. \u201cThe Saudi state security agency\u2019s announcement which labels feminism, atheism and homosexuality as extremist ideas punishable by jail and flogging is outrageous \u2013 clearly contradicting the kingdom\u2019s bogus reformist image which crown prince Mohammed bin Salman continues to flaunt internationally.\u201d Felix Jakens, Amnesty UK\u2019s head of campaigns, called for teams and drivers to speak out: \u201cWith critics of the government either jailed, exiled or hounded into silence, the Saudi authorities have pursued a twin-track approach of crushing human rights while throwing large amounts of money at glittering sporting events. \u201cThe bitter irony over a Saudi Grand Prix is that the very people who fought for the rights of Saudi women to be able to drive are now themselves languishing in jail. Brave people like Loujain al-Hathloul and Nassima al-Sada. In the lead-up to the race, we\u2019re saying to F1 drivers, owners and teams they should brief themselves on the dire human rights situation in the country and be prepared to speak out about the plight of Loujain, Nassima and others.\u201d When asked last week about the prospect of a GP in Saudi Arabia, Lewis Hamilton, who has been strident in his campaign for diversity and equality in F1, said he would need to find out more abut the regime before making a judgment. At the Emilia Romagna GP the world champion wore a Black Lives Matter T-shirt that included the phrase \u201cWomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d. Saudi Arabia has been making a concerted effort to host major sporting events in recent years, including Formula E meetings and a world heavyweight title fight between Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr. The Spanish Super Cup was held in Jeddah and in February the world\u2019s richest horse race, the Saudi Cup, was run in the capital. The state\u2019s sovereign wealth fund recently failed in a takeover bid for Newcastle. F1 has lost huge amounts of income this season with races cancelled and meetings held behind closed doors. The reported $50m (\u00a338.7m) fee for Saudi Arabia would be a major boost. Formula One said in response: \u201cFor decades F1 has worked hard to be a positive force everywhere it races, including economic, social and cultural benefits. Sports like F1 are uniquely positioned to cross borders and cultures to bring countries and communities together to share the passion and excitement of incredible competition and achievement. \u201cWe take our responsibilities very seriously and have made our position on human rights and other issues clear to all our partners and host countries who commit to respect human rights in the way their events are hosted and delivered.\u201d The calendar has yet to be ratified by the World Motor Sport Council but next year\u2019s 23-round F1 schedule is expected to be signed off in the coming weeks. Saudi authorities were approached by the Guardian for a response to this article but have yet to respond."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
