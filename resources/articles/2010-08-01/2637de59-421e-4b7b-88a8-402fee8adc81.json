A modest increase in the number of people working longer hours since last summer was recorded by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. The economic downturn led to a loss of more than half a million jobs in the two years to spring 2010 and a shift from full-time to part-time employment. Full-time employment fell by almost a million in the same period, while the number of part-time jobs increased by 330,000, according to CIPD research published today. Many people opted to work shorter hours to help their employers cut costs and avoid job losses during the recession, which the study found resulted in a fall of 32 million hours worked each week. The total number of working hours has begun to rise, indicating a \"modest\" pick-up in demand for workers in the past year, said the CIPD report. The institute said there was more of a \"mixed hours\" culture, with as many people working between 16 and 30 hours a week as those putting in more than 45 hours. John Philpott, the chief economic adviser at the CIPD, said: \"A marked shift to shorter working hours has been one of the key characteristics of the recession. But signs of an increase in long hours working since the trough in hours in summer 2009 suggest that the fall in working time during the jobs downturn was a forced detox for Britain's workaholics, most of whom will be eager to start putting in the hours again once the economic recovery gathers steam. \"HR managers mindful of the importance of a sensible work-life balance will need to determine whether a return to long hours working is the best outcome for staff or the organisations that employ them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
