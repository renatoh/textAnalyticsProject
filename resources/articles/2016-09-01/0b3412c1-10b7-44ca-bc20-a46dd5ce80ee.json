Zaina Erhaim, an award-winning journalist and campaigner based in Turkey, had her passport taken away by UK border officials when she landed at Heathrow airport. After more than an hour of questioning, they told her that the document had been reported stolen. The complaint came from the government she has been campaigning against for years. \u201cI expect to be harassed inside my country,\u2019 Erhaim told the Observer. \u201cI know that if I went home I would be killed, but now I find that Assad\u2019s arm can even reach to the UK. This is a dictator pursuing a journalist.\u201d A receipt that Erhaim was given for the passport states: \u201cDocument reported as stolen.\u201d Erhaim, who is travelling to the UK for an event with the BBC\u2019s Kate Adie at the Kew literary festival, said it contained her name, photograph and fingerprint. Erhaim had previously used the passport without problems to travel to the UK in April, when she collected the Index on Censorship\u2019s Freedom of Expression Journalism award for her work. She had also travelled on it without any problems across Europe. The officials told her that they \u201cdid not get involved in politics\u201d and that this was \u201cour system, our rules\u201d. The passport would be returned to Damascus, they said. Erhaim also has an older Syrian passport that she can use to return to Turkey, because it is still valid. But because it has no pages left for visas or immigration stamps \u2013 the reason she got the new document \u2013 she will effectively be unable to leave Turkey again. \u201cThis is just the regime trying to handicap us,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are collaborating with him. And they still wonder why Syrians are floating all over Europe seeking asylum.\u201d The decision is particularly painful because it was taken by a government that had given Erhaim a prestigious Chevening Award, which brings \u201cfuture leaders, influencers and decision-makers\u201d to study in the UK. \u201cWhat really, really hurts me is I am a Chevening scholar, you funded my master\u2019s degree and I work for a UK-based, UK-funded organisation,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd despite that you take the regime\u2019s word against mine.\u201d The development came two days after foreign secretary Boris Johnson said a change of government was the key to peace in Syria, and blamed Assad\u2019s government for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Syrians. \u201cThere can be no genuine ceasefire unless there is a genuine political agreement that we can have a transition away from the Assad government,\u201d Johnson told the UN security council. \u201cBecause it is the Assad government that is responsible. That regime is responsible for the vast majority of the 400,000 deaths.\u201d The Home Office said Britain had to comply with the request because passports are the legal property of the government that issues them. \u201cIf a passport is reported as lost or stolen by a foreign government we have no choice but to confiscate it,\u201d the spokesman said. He suggested that Erhaim seek consular assistance from the Syrian government, which has a well-documented history of imprisoning, torturing and killing opponents. This was condemned by Index on Censorship, which invited Erhaim to speak at the event. \u201cI am appalled and frankly ashamed at the treatment of Zaina Erhaim by the UK. This is a woman who has risked her life simply to do what every good journalist aspires to do \u2013 bring both sides of the story \u2013 in an area of conflict that is also her home,\u201d chief executive Jodie Ginsberg said. \u201cThe message the UK sends when it takes such action is that it is not on the side of those struggling to defend human dignity amid the inhumanity of war.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
