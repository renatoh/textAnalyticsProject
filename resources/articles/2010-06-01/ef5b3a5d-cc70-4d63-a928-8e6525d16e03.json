We start by hearing from Raphael Honigstein about Germany's terrific start against Australia. Can this young side go all way? And was the Socceroos' starting line-up the least ambitious we'll see in this competition? Jonathan Wilson shares his thoughts on England's weaknesses, and his experience of the tournament so far. This is a man, remember, who thinks 'goals are overrated'. Finally, we look ahead to tomorrow's games, including Holland's meeting with Denmark, and the first outing for World Champions Italy, who take on Paraguay. Tweet us all you want, and we'll see you tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
