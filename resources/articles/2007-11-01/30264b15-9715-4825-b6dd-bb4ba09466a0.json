It came without setup discs. I want to extract Windows XP from the hard drive to install on a new laptop, which I'm downgrading from Vista because some software won't run. Tim Brown I'm sure that the Windows XP that came with the Acer was \"licensed with the hardware as a single integrated product and may only be used with the hardware\", which is why it didn't cost you very much. You have no legal right to run it on any other machine. Even if you can get it running, you would still have to activate it. (A retail copy of Windows XP can be moved between PCs, but is absurdly expensive.) Microsoft often provides \"downgrade rights\" as these can be useful to businesses. Vista Business and Ultimate can both be \"downgraded\". In the unlikely event that you have one of these, you will have to read your EULA (End User Licence Agreement) to check your options. However, I'm surprised if you have many programs that won't run under Vista. The ones that won't run are usually programs that operate at a low level (where Vista has changed a lot from XP) or perform non-legal operations. Examples are anti-malware programs, CD/DVD authoring programs, and games. See the list at tinyurl.com/f5arg. To get other software to run, right-click each program's .exe file, select Properties, and then click the tab marked Compatibility. Tick the box that says \"Run this program in compatibility mode for\" and then select the mode you want. Examples include Windows 95, Windows 2000 and Windows XP (Service Pack 2). You may also need to tick one or more boxes such as \"Disable visual themes\" and probably \"Run this program as an administrator\". At home, all our software runs in Vista without using a compatibility mode, though some programs needed patches. I'd have doubts about both the programming competence and management capabilities of any company whose current software doesn't run under Vista. I'd look for alternatives, rather than downgrade. Laptop plus monitor I sometimes use an external monitor with my laptop. How do I stop the display closing down when the laptop lid is shut, please? Mike Cooper Go to the Control Panel and run the applet called Power Options. Click the Advanced tab on the properties sheet, and look for the section that says: \"When I close the lid of my portable computer\". Click the down arrow for the list of options, and select \"Do nothing\". Dialup downloads The downloads required to keep Windows antivirus, firewall and anti-spyware software up to date takes a terrible toll on a 56K dialup connection. What is your recommendation for people who use the internet only occasionally, and for whom pay-per-minute dialup is perfectly adequate? Richard Bell The downloads tend to be small so there shouldn't be a problem if you log on every day or so. That's reasonable if you use email. Failing that, you could try \"borrowing\" a broadband connection from a relative or friend just after the second Tuesday of each month: that's when Microsoft releases its monthly Windows Update. If you connect via a Cat 5 cable to a router (not a USB modem), the connection should be automatic and should not disturb your dialup settings. Does anyone have a better idea? Twain and Twunk What exactly are Twain and Twunk? I think they're probably something to do with Lexmark, but I'm getting conflicting messages as to whether they're healthy or not. Tom Drane Twain is a standard system for talking to scanners and digital cameras (twain.org). Twunk_16.exe and Twunk_32.exe are usually legitimate Twain files. However, the Blackmal.C trojan also uses these filenames to avoid detection: Symantec has details (tinyurl.com/yshkjk). You can tell from part 4 if your version is malware. Otherwise, most anti-virus products should pick it up. Double check using SuperAntiSpyware. Backchat \u00b7 Gren Dix asked about his \"missing\" drive space. I pointed out that part of the problem was that manufacturers used decimal instead of binary counting, and that their \"20GB\" is 20bn bytes, and therefore only 18.6GB. Kevin Williams has bought a 320GB drive that's really 300GB and asks: \"Has the industry considered regulating the marketing of drive space more honestly?\" The problem is they would all have to do it at once, which they won't. Also, as the numbers get bigger, the difference gets bigger. The International Electrotechnical Commission's recommendation is to add a \"bi\" for binary bytes, and use gibibytes instead of gigabytes. A 20GB drive would therefore be 18.6GiB. There are also kibibytes (KiB), mebibytes (MiB), tebibytes (TiB) and so on. \u00b7 blogs.theguardian.com/askjack"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
