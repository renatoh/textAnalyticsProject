Seafood exporters are the latest industry group to report disruptions in accessing the Chinese market and Geoff Raby, the Australian ambassador to China from 2007 to 2011, said Australia needed China more than the other way around. Raby, in an interview with Guardian Australia, argued that Australia had joined itself at the hip with the United States over the past few years in seeking to resist China\u2019s rise \u2013 an approach he believed went against Australia\u2019s interests. That is despite the Morrison government\u2019s assertions \u2013 including at high-level talks in Washington in July \u2013 that Canberra is pursuing its own policy and is not doing anything to injure the important relationship with Beijing. In a new book published on Tuesday, Raby suggests Australia\u2019s strategy for managing the rise of China has been \u201cincremental, reactive to others\u2019 agendas, and as such, incoherent\u201d. He also says talk about Australia significantly diversifying its economic relationship with China by turning to other markets is \u201cnothing other than wishful thinking\u201d. The complementarities between the two economies \u201care so profound that Australia\u2019s economic dependency on China will not change\u201d unless Australians choose to accept a major cut in their living standards, according to the book, China\u2019s Grand Strategy and Australia\u2019s Future in the New Global Order. \u201cCanberra hates this, but I start with the premise that it\u2019s an asymmetrical relationship [and] whether we like it or not, we need China more than they need us,\u201d Raby, who is also a former Australian ambassador to the World Trade Organization, said in the interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of who\u2019s right or wrong. Diplomacy and pragmatic foreign policy should be about getting outcomes and results that are in your interests.\u201d The Australian government has said it will not bow to economic pressure and is seeking to stand up for its values. Raby questioned whether Australia\u2019s interests were best served by the current situation \u201cwhere we have exposed ourselves to repeated rounds of Chinese economic coercion\u201d. He said while Australia should reject China\u2019s economic coercion \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not going to keep doing it to us and we\u2019re not going to keep paying the price\u201d. On Monday, the Morrison government called on Beijing to provide certainty to Australian rock lobster exporters, after several shipments were held up by customs authorities for further testing over the weekend. The Seafood Trade Advisory Group, which represents seafood exporters on trade and market access issues, said there were positive signs on Monday \u201cwith the Chinese authorities undertaking additional testing over the weekend and confirmation that delayed consignments are starting to clear customs\u201d. The delays had fuelled fears that seafood could be the next Australian sector affected by trade tensions with China after barley, beef, cotton, coal and wine were all targeted by official or undeclared trade actions. While it is difficult to quantify the cost of the trade war, Perth USAsia Centre research shared with Guardian Australia last week showed the total annual value of exports to China in the five industries affected by declared and undeclared sanctions was $19bn. An additional $28bn worth of services exports could be at risk if Beijing\u2019s warnings to its citizens against travel to Australia \u2013 based on claims of an elevated risk of racist attacks \u2013 prevents a post-Covid recovery in tourism and international education. Raby likened the Australian government\u2019s approach to the Black Knight, the hapless character from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. \u201cThe Black Knight\u2019s got his arms and legs chopped off and he yells \u2018Come back you chicken\u2019. We\u2019re a bit like that. And I\u2019m just calling for pragmatic, realist policy.\u201d Australia needed to think about how it could offer a circuit breaker without selling out its interests, Raby said. \u201cIt needs to be about changing the conversation with China,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that matter most to Beijing, I\u2019d argue from a country like Australia, is recognising China\u2019s territorial integrity, the legitimacy of the Communist party as the governing party of China and China\u2019s ascendancy as a major power in the region and one that needs to be respected for that.\u201d In the book, Raby contends that recognition of China\u2019s interests and its party-state are required for Australia to seek opportunities to engage with Beijing on issues such as the environment, water resources, energy, terrorism, transnational crime, cyberwarfare and the militarisation of space. He lays out several other foundations for \u201ca grand strategy\u201d for Australia, including no longer taking for granted America\u2019s preparedness to defend Australia. Canberra\u2019s strategy should also include increased investment in Australia\u2019s cultural diplomacy and soft power in the region, and a return to \u201cactivist middle-power diplomacy involving coalition building across a range of issues\u201d. Raby, an ambassador to Apec in the early 2000s, says regional states should seek common purpose when dealing with China \u201cto remind Beijing that a push against one is a push against all\u201d. After serving as Canberra\u2019s top diplomat in Beijing for four years until 2011, Raby has more recently provided advisory services to Australian and Chinese businesses. He is registered on the Australian government\u2019s foreign influence transparency scheme as a board member of Yancoal, a resources company that is listed on the Australian stock exchange but majority-owned by a Chinese state-owned enterprise. In the book, Raby criticises the Chinese government over \u201cwidespread internment camps\u201d across the Xinjiang region and notes Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201cincreasingly authoritarian control of domestic politics\u201d. \u201cHaving as our major economic partner a wilful, difficult, abrasive but nonetheless brittle and still weak power, one that is more comfortable with tyranny than democracy, but on which Australia\u2019s economic wellbeing and security in the region rest, is the dystopian future that Australian policymakers will need to learn to navigate,\u201d he writes. Raby summarises the Chinese government\u2019s strategic objectives as security for its borders, respect for its territorial integrity, and protecting the continued rule of the Communist party. He argues China is \u201ca constrained superpower\u201d that acts as \u201cboth a status quo power and a disruptor\u201d and has a range of strategic vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities include China\u2019s heavy dependence on other countries for the resources and energy it needs to fuel its economic growth, leaving it exposed to future disruptions in supply."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
