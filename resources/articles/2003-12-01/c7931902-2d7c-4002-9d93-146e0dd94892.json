Haddock as long as a man's torso; record dab, plaice and turbot weighing up to 16lb. That was 30 years ago, when Mr McLean sported a thick black beard and his fellow sea anglers flocked to the island in their hundreds for its annual fish festival. Now, his hair is grey and the fish are gone; the waters of Lamlash bay strangely still beneath the steady surge of the waves. \"There was always good fishing on Arran,\" says Mr McLean, 68. \"There was fish everywhere; quality cod and haddock. No other place produced haddock like this. Now you might catch the odd haddie in the summer. But I haven't seen any for 12 years.\" Today, the people of Arran hope to persuade the Scottish executive and the fishermen of the Firth of Clyde to let them start reversing the decline in marine life. At a meeting in Glasgow, they will ask if they can set up Scotland's first official no-take zone in a small section of Lamlash bay. There are 490,000 square miles of commercial fishing grounds around the UK but only one statutory no-take zone, a a 2 mile zone around Lundy Island off North Devon, set up by English Nature this year. Scientists have estimated that up to a third of the world's oceans will need to be designated as marine protected areas if the global fishing industry is to be saved. The Arran trial would see a 240 hectare (600 acre) section of Lamlash bay set aside as a no-take zone, from which no marine life can be removed. A further 550 hectares would be designated as a marine protected area, closed to mobile fishing gear and commercial diving. A scientific study would measure the impact. The proposal is small scale, but the islanders say it is a crucial first step to countering the devastating effects of modern commercial fishing. \"There will be dire consequences unless something gets done,\" says Howard Wood, of the community of Arran seabed trust. \"Even in two or three years time there will be nothing left and the politicians will have to do something.\" Mr Wood, 49, was one of the first to raise concerns about the decline in Arran's marine life almost a decade ago. A recreational diver, he was used to swimming through shoals of fish or small scallops, known as queenies. When his 16-year-old son started diving this year, it took six months before he saw his first fish. \"When you went through a shoal of queenies it is like a cloud of butterflies; they would rise up from the seabed,\" said Mr Wood. \"There are virtually no queenies left. You need areas that fish can mature in. Around Britain at the moment, no marine life is getting to the stage of maturing.\" Other countries that have embraced marine regeneration, including New Zealand, Australia and Canada, have amassed compelling evidence that no-take zones vastly improve fish stocks. \"Marine protected areas are remarkably effective tools for recovering stocks of exploited species,\" says Callum Roberts, professor of marine conservation science at York University. \"Within about five years of establishing a marine protected area , you can expect to see a doubling or trebling of the amount of exploited species present.\" Mr Roberts is encouraged by the Arran initiative, but argues that it is the government who should be pushing such strategies. \"The government is really dragging its feet on marine protection; we really need to ramp it up.\" The Scottish executive, which recently announced a consultation on the marine environment, said the Arran trial could only proceed with the agreement of all interested parties. Patrick Stewart of the Clyde Fishermen's Association says he is going to today's meeting with an open mind, but expects to oppose the plans. He rejects arguments that the Clyde has been overfished. He says the industry has not declined, just changed, and cannot see the benefit to science or the industry from the Arran project. \"If I said your garden should not be planted with roses because I want to see what happens when your garden is not planted with roses what benefit does that have to the countryside of Scotland?\" he said. \"The answer is nothing at all. These are matters for the state because they have such wide repercussions. I would oppose this proposal but not the concept.\" Don Macneish, chairman of the Arran initiative hopes that the fishermen will recognise the benefit to their industry. \"For us to tell them to agree to give us 0.0001% of their fishing ground seems to be like us saying to them we're going to sink your boats and you will never be able to make any money. We are not saying that. We're saying if we do this there might be a business for their sons and sons' sons.\" Neil McLean has been trying for 30 years to persuade the Clyde fishermen to let the waters of Lamlash Bay recover. The time for action, he says, is running out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
