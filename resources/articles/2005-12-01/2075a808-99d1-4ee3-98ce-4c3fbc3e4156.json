All right, it is definitely an upmarket, white, middle-class world where the neuroses of the main characters are explored while wandering streets strangely devoid of the poor and the down-at-heel. And yes, the films are a mixed bag of cinematic achievement. But, if you share just a little of his love of New York and are beguiled by the city's gorgeous screen appearances, then to pound the streets of the city in the footsteps of Woody Allen is thoroughly recommended. The centre of Allen's film world is the Upper East Side, reaching out to Midtown and with forays into Soho and Greenwich Village. It's among the swanky and highly expensive real estate of the Upper East Side that Allen lives. He's never had to venture far from his own front door with a camera, especially in perhaps his best and most highly regarded work, Manhattan. A walk starting from Allen's neighbourhood will take in many of this film's locations and include some from his other movies. Like the opening narration of the film Manhattan there are several possible starts to this walk. So long as you start on the eastern side of Central Park close to the Guggenheim Museum you'll be in a good position to orient yourself. The best place to begin is on the roof terrace of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This is where you get those wonderful views of the buildings that flank the park and the trees beneath them - especially so in autumn. This roof-top vantage point, however, does mean that you have to pay an entrance fee to get into the museum - so, this done, you might as well get lost inside this great temple of art for a few hours. After lunch in the superb basement cafeteria you'll be fit for the walk. Go north up Fifth Avenue to find the Guggenheim Museum designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. It's not difficult to miss, striking a dramatic pose on the edge of the city's Museum Mile. The building's exterior, white bands of concrete, is a landmark in this part of town. The museum has undergone a facelift since his best friend's mistress in Manhattan artistically humiliated Allen's character, Isaac, and his teenage lover in one of its galleries. Heading east form here takes you into the decidedly smart and sassy Upper East Side. Walking along 89th Street towards Second Avenue, tall apartment blocks huddle next to older low-rise townhouses. Sweating joggers with iPods attached to the arms of their Yale-alumnus hoodies are ushered into vestibules by men in tasselled jackets and caps. Children in the uniforms of private preparatory schools confidently strut the sidewalks avoiding the cracks. On 89th between Park Avenue and Lexington is the Dalton School - the school that Tracy, the object of Isaac's desire, attended. Continuing the walk east, the rarefied neighbourhood air takes on a more business-like feel. As you hit Second Avenue you hit the noise and bustle. Turning south on Second you soon pass Elaine's restaurant where the opening scene of Manhattan takes place. Celebrity stalkers take note - this is reputed to be a favourite haunt of Woody. Elaine's sits incongruously in an area known as Yorkville. It's a pleasant muddle of the posh and the humble, like many areas of this city. The restaurant remains fiercely shuttered during the day, ignoring the thrift shop across the street, the butcher's, the boot mender and the dry cleaner. Walk south, pulled along by the tide of fast-walking Manhattanites. You can cross over to First Avenue at any time the mood takes you. Like its neighbouring grand avenue the pace is fast. You're only a couple of blocks from the East River, and once you catch sight of the elevated ramp up onto the Queensboro Bridge you're close to Sutton Place Park at the very end of 58th Street. From here you get the classic, Manhattan film poster view of the bridge. This is where Woody Allen and Diane Keaton's characters admired the late-night view from a bench. The bench is no longer there, but this is still a relatively tranquil spot in another upmarket neighbourhood where smartly dressed women walk (or carry) smartly groomed dogs. Keaton's dog, by the way, was a dachshund. Head west from Sutton Place, along 59th Street until you reach Lexington Avenue. Here you'll come across Bloomingdale's department store, home of the famous brown carrier bag and hundreds of tourists eager to acquire one to take home. The appeal of the store to New Yorkers, and its reputation as a desirable place in which to be seen, are as strong as ever. The perfume counters are the place for liaisons of the dangerous kind, as they were for two of the characters in Manhattan. Continuing the theme of illicit meetings, go south down Lexington. You're on your way into the Midtown. Some of the city's top hotels are to be found within a mile or so of this location. When you come to 55th go west until it meets 5th Avenue. Here is the French baroque style St Regis-Sheraton hotel, built over 100 years ago and used as the setting for the clandestine meetings between the characters played by Michael Caine and Barbara Hershey in Hannah and her Sisters. If the menus in the restaurants look too pricey then just keep going along 55th until you hit 7th Avenue. The Carnegie Deli attracts tourists by the drove but it's still a place where you can get good old-fashioned New York staples. It was used as a location for the movie Broadway Danny Rose and - obsessive fans take note - Woody Allen has been known to dine there. Go on one short block and turn right onto Broadway, the backbone of Manhattan Island. It's not far up to Columbus Circle, remodelled in recent years. Here is a grand entrance to Central Park. If you take Central Park West instead of going straight into the park here you can enter at 67th Street and walk right past the Tavern on Green where Alan Alda's film producer character offers Woody Allen a job in the film Crimes and Misdemeanours. You're back in the park. Head vaguely north-east and you'll end up back where you started, on the Magnificent Mile. Well, vaguely anyway. What does it matter, you're in New York? You're in one hell of a big film set. Go wander.
