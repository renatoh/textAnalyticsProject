The Faber Book of Science edited by John Carey This collection contains some of the best science writing since Leonardo da Vinci first picked up a quill. From Newton's discovery that white light is made up of a rainbow of colours, to Armstrong and Aldrin's first moon walk, Carey lets the history of science unfurl in the words of the people who made it happen. I can't recommend this book strongly enough. 2. Possible Worlds by J B S Haldane (Chatto and Windlass 1927) The British biologist J B S Haldane, who died in 1964, ranks as one of the best science writers we've ever had. A dedicated Marxist who wrote for newspapers and magazines in the 1920's and 30's, he combined clear explanation of scientific ideas with forthright political opinions and vivid personal anecdotes. This is one of the best collections of Haldane's articles but, for a taste of his work, read his essay On Being the Right Size in Carey's The Faber Book of Science. 3. The Man Who Counted by Malba Tahan In a series of tales straight out of the Arabian Nights, Beremiz Samir, an ingenious Persian mathematician, uses his mathematical skills to solve puzzles, settle quarrels, and overcome his adversaries, thereby winning his way to fame and fortune. A mathematical fantasy, originally aimed at children of 10 years and older (but with a narrative that will captivate any adult), this book deserves to be as widely read as Harry Potter. It must be good: I lent my copy to a friend several years ago and haven't had it back. 4. Zarafa by Michael Allin Zarafa was the first giraffe ever seen in France. This delightful book tells the story of her capture in Africa, her journey down the Nile and her marathon 550 mile walk from Marseille to Paris. The sight of this extraordinary long-necked animal so astonished the people that by the time she arrived at le Jardin des Plantes, the French centre for research into natural history, in 1827 she was feted as a celebrity. I love this book for its meticulous research and beautiful writing. It's a simple tale, but one to treasure. 5. Darwin by Adrian Desmond and James Moore I don't think I've read a better biography. This one grips from beginning to end: the dilettante student; the adventure of the Beagle; the stress of his secret theory; the illnesses; the acclaim that greeted The Origin; it's all here, thrillingly written, wrapped in insight and peppered with so many brilliantly observed details that you feel you're walking in Darwin's shoes. 6. The Double Helix by James D Watson On a recent visit to the Science Museum I found myself marveling at how Crick and Watson's original model of DNA - the famous double helix - was held together, Heath-Robinson style, by a handful of retort stands. Watson's own account of how he and Crick unraveled its structure in Cambridge in the 1950's - between chasing girls and surviving the college food - is one of the classics of science literature. 7. Fermat's Last Theorem by Simon Singh In the pages of an old text book the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat left a tantalising note: \"I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain\". His proof, however, was never found, and the proposition - Fermat's last theorem - remained unsolved for 358 years. Simon Singh's compelling account of the quest to solve the riddle is a tale of driven personalities, mathematical enigmas, and, ultimately, sheer determination. 8. On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen by Harold McGee This is more of a reference book to dip into, rather than a book to read in one go, but it's a great volume to have handy in the kitchen to answer those puzzling questions such as why sauces thicken, how toast browns, and why some meat is white and other meat red. 9. Companion to the Cosmos by John Gribbin This book is surely a must for amateur astronomers, or indeed anyone interested in the universe and what makes it tick. It's essentially an encylopaedia of astronomy, but Gribbin's explanations are beautifully clear, and the range of subjects covered - from aberration to ZZ-Ceti stars - is as comprehensive as most people could wish. 10. Bold Science: Seven Scientists who are Changing Our World by Ted Anton Entertaining short biographies of some of the major players at the cutting edge of science today: gene-mapper Craig Venter; neuroscientist Susan Greenfield; planet-hunter Geoffrey Marcy; immunobiologist Polly Matzinger; cosmologist Saul Perlmutter; conservation biologist Gretchen Daily; and physicist turned evolutionist Carl Woese."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
