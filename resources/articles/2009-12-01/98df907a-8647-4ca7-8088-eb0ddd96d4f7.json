Avram Grant left Chelsea tonight with nothing other than sympathy to cling to and another Chelsea penalty to curse. The league leaders had re-established their advantage at the top here somewhat fortuitously at his Portsmouth side's expense. At least the last time the Israeli was dismissed from these parts there had been the promise of a pay-off to sweeten his exit. It is almost 19 months since Grant took the Londoners to within one penalty kick of their first Champions League trophy in Moscow and, where that one was fluffed by John Terry, here the Israeli was left deflated by a conversion. Frustration had been welling in home ranks at Pompey's rugged resistance when, 11 minutes from time, Marc Wilson panicked and slid in crudely on Branislav Ivanovic to puncture his own team's chances of an unlikely point by sending the Serb plunging. The spot kick was clear, and converted emphatically by Frank Lampard. The last time Grant witnessed the England midfielder scoring a penalty at Stamford Bridge had been in the second leg of the Champions League semi-final against Liverpool in the spring of 2008. He had sunk to his knees in delirious celebration on that occasion, with passage to Moscow beckoning. This time the 54-year-old was left with head hung and the potential ignominy of the Championship, rather than Champions League spoils, to come. He took what positives he could from defeat: a warm reception in the most part from the home fans, a valiant team performance from his new side and, almost, an unexpected point. \"We closed them down, made sure they didn't create too many chances, and if the result was disappointing then the performance was good,\" said Grant. \"The reception was touching. It made my heart warm that people respect the great year we had at this club (in 2007-08 under his leadership). But we are bottom, they are top, and you couldn't see a big difference.\" Chelsea were aware of how uncomfortable it all felt. This victory may have curtailed a four-match sequence without a win, but it was a stodgy and, at times, desperate display. Denied Didier Drogba by a back injury, their forward line lacked muscle despite Nicolas Anelka's menace. At the back, they remain uncharacteristically fragile. The goal shipped to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Piquionne six minutes after the interval was outrageous, Jamie O'Hara's free-kick deflecting first from Salomon Kalou and then from Ashley Cole into the Frenchman's path, but it was the 12th goal from a set-piece among the 14 conceded this term. Terry had admitted in his programme notes that the set-piece defending in Saturday's 3-3 draw with Everton had been \"unacceptable\". Pompey, too, might have prospered here in the driving sleet had they retained more composure in front of goal, with Carlo Ancelotti bemoaning a lack of communication between his own charges at times. On the break the visitors' threat was sporadic, Hermann Hreidarsson failing to convert from close-range after Petr Cech had parried Piquionne's attempt, and Tal Ben Haim flicking over the bar, but a combination of occasional vulnerability at the back and profligacy at the other end might have cost the hosts yet more points. This was messy, but the inquest has been staved off with a chance to impose themselves \u2013 most likely with Drogba fit and fresh \u2013 at West Ham on Sunday. \"We did a good job, not a beautiful job,\" said Ancelotti. \"There were 15 minutes in the second half after they had equalised when we lost our composure. We were afraid of drawing the game and lost our idea to play. But we reacted well and, in the end, deserved to win. That was the most important thing: to win after four games without a victory.\" The hosts might have capitalised more comfortably against a re-shaped Pompey line-up, with injuries and illness prompting seven changes from the draw at Sunderland, but Anelka's was the only reward taken from the early pressure. Kalou had nodded awkwardly over an empty net, unnerved by Steve Finnan's presence, by the time Alex barged his way beyond Wilson to the by-line and pulled back for Anelka to convert. The Frenchman had scored only one league goal for Grant following a \u00a315m move from Bolton, also against Portsmouth, and had ended up missing the last penalty in the Champions League final. Asmir Begovic's excellence kept him at bay thereafter, and might have earned the visitors their draw, until Grant endured his cruel finale."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
