Tens of thousands of citizens of all races and religions and most political persuasions demonstrated against government policy. So, naturally, the BBC decided to keep the event a secret on its news broadcasts. Possibly, the browbeaten post-Hutton corporation just couldn't afford the expenses to get a crew from White City to Trafalgar Square. They can't pretend they didn't know the march was happening - they had given John Reid ample airtime to denounce it in advance. It is all of a piece with a steady tightening of the screws by the establishment as the catastrophe in the Middle East becomes more and more bloody and intractable. Certainly, the last few months have seen an increase in institutional hostility towards the anti-war movement from \"authority\" - more harassment from police, more obstruction placed in the way of public political activity by local councils and university bodies. I'm sure this is not separate from the general post 7/7 assault on civil liberties. There is a steady trend towards, if not the criminalisation of opposition, at least to its delegitimisation in the public space. Hence the craven attitude of the BBC. Not that it made much difference on Saturday, probably the biggest anti-war protest since 2003, the year of the attack on Iraq and the Bush state visit, when demonstrations reduced the President to circling Buckingham Palace in his limousine. Diverse, united, militant and numerous. What made the difference? The increasingly dreadful news from Iraq, of course: the massive assault on Samarra and the clear evidence that the occupation is stimulating rather than preventing a civil war between Sunnis and Shia - not my assessment, but that of MI6 agent turned US-appointed premier Ilyad Allawi. That and the new crisis in occupied Palestine surely helped mobilise people for one further trip to London to protest against a manifestly calamitous foreign policy. But I believe the spirit and the turnout was also raised by factors that have little to do with the war directly - the prime minister's new dependence on Tory votes to secure the passage of his legislation, and the engulfing loans-for-ermine scandal. We are nearing the end of the road which the government set out on when it pledged to follow George Bush wherever his war lead after 9/11. There is a smell of death around New Labour. It is being nailed to that eternal pillory from which all the spinning of its PR machine will not avail to redeem it, and tens of thousands want to bear public witness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
