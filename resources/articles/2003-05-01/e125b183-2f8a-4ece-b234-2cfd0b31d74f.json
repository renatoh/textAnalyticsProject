The Brazilian has been struggling with a calf injury he picked up in the first-leg last week which Real won 2-1, and his place in attack goes to Raul, who is fully fit again after missing the first match due to an appendix operation. In the absence of injured French midfielder Claude Makalele, Real coach Vicente Del Bosque opts for Argentine Esteban Cambiasso in the defensive midfield role alongside Flavio Conceicao. Juventus coach Marcello Lippi opts for Croatian Igor Tudor to partner Paolo Montero in the centre of defence in place of the suspended Ciro Ferrara. General whinge at the Disney Corproation rounded off by unreasonable request from Mike Madden in the USA: \"For some reason known only to the executives at Walt Disney who own ESPN, only Tuesday matches in the Champions League are televised here in the States. Instead of Real Madrid v Juventus, ESPN2 is showing some NBA highlight show featuring comedian Bernie Mac. So we here will be depending on you today. No typos please.\" That's told me. And Uncle Walt. Build-up: Teams come out, teams line up, teams listen to fancy music, handshakes all round, photographs etc. You know the drill at this stage. Players on yellow cards: Birindelli, Zambrotta and Nedved from Juventus. 1 min: Trezuguet has an early chance for Juventus, but Real spring the offside trap and the linesman waves his flag. 2 mins: Juventus have started at quite a fair clip and have done all of the attacking in the opening couple of minutes. 3 mins: Real Madrid win a free-kick about 40 yards out after Davids clatters Guti. Roberto Carlos takes his customary 20 metre sprint up to the ball and leathers it. The ball fizzes narrowly wide of the motionless Buffon's left post and almost curls in. If it had gone in, it would have been a replica of that free-kick Carlos scored for Brazil against France six years ago. 5 mins: There's been more action in the opening five minutes of this game than in both legs of the all-Milan semi-final. It's - cliche alert! - real end-to-end stuff. Juventus are having the better of it so far. Salgado fouls Del Piero, who wins a free-kick down near the corner flag deep in Real territory. It's deflected out for a throw-in, with which Davids tees up Nedved for a long-range shot. Wide. 9 mins: Real remain camped in their own half, with Hierro having to block a volleyed dipper from outside the area by Zambrotta. Soon afterwards, Del Piero squanders a half-decent goalscoring chance from distance after Roberto Carlos had carelessly gifted him possession. 11 mins: GOAL: Juventus 1 - 0 Real Madrid (Agg: 2-2) Game on! David Trezeguet sneaks one home from the edge of the six-yard box after latching on to a brilliant knock-down from Del Piero. Desperate goalkeeping from Casillas, who allowed the ball to go past him at his near post. 14 mins: You'll be delighted to hear that my computer has taken to throwing J-Lo hissy fits every time I try to launch a new snatch of commentary, so you'll have to accept my apologies in advance for any delays. Juve's goal was no more than they deserved for their sprightly start, but the blame for it would have to be laid squarely at the door of their young goalkeeper and Esteban Cambiasso, who was caught in no-man's land when he should have been running across the edge of the six-yard box to mark Trezeguet. Regardless of whose fault it was, the fact of the matter now is that Juventus have the upper hand in this tie on away goals. 17 mins: Igor Tudor cuts across Zinedine Zidane, causes obstruction and concedes a free-kick about just outside the D of the Juventus penalty area. Zidane has a pop and the ball is deflected out for a corner by the Juve wall. 20 mins: \"Why hasn't anyone dubbed Zidane 'the footballing monk' or something to that effect?\" writes Tracey Mohr in a mail entitled \"Zidane's hair\". While I'm pondering this conundrum, Raul finds himself with the ball at his feet, alone in front of the Juventus 'keeper about eight yards out. Unable to believe his luck, he looks at the linesman before duffing a half-hearted shot straight at Buffon. There was no flag. If he'd scored it would have counted and he'll never have an easier chance. Play the whistle son! 23 mins: The Brazilian Conceicao up-ends Davids just outside the Real Madrid penalty area and goes into the referee's notebook for his troubles. Juve waste the free-kick. My computer freezes again, before announcing that it's going to do a cache clean-up. Whatever that is. 27 mins: A bit of a lull. Which is minute-by-minute speak for \"anything could have happened, but I don't know because I was under the desk trying to meddle with technology I really don't understand.\" (I realise this revelation may come as something of a shock to those of you who continue to labour under the delusion that I'm actually at the match, snuggled between Steve McManaman and Ronaldo in the Real Madrid dug-out.) 30 mins: Figo squanders a scoring opportunity by ballooning a free-kick from just outside the area over the bar. My computer informs me that it's doing yet another \"cache clean-up: removing 79 files.\" Heap of junk. The match has definitely slowed down in the last 10 minutes, though. 31 mins: Trezeguet attempts to score with an ambitious bicycle-kick after being picked out in the Real box by an excellent cross from Nedved. He doesn't make firm contact with the ball, but if he had, the three Real defenders who didn't bother picking him up would have had a few questions to answer. 35 mins: Juventus blow a fantastic opportunity to go 2-0 up on the night. On the edge of the penalty area, Del Piero gets in front of Hierro before making a monkey of him by beating him to the ball and then turning him inside out. In the process, the ball rolls into the path of Trezeguet who, despite being clean through, snatches at it and scuffs his shot straight at Casillas in the Real goal. The goalkeeper needlessly spills it and Trezeguet is forced too wide to do anything with the rebound. After some slapstick defending from Real, Miguel Salgado eventually hacks the ball into Row Z. 39 mins: \"I'm tired of Americans complaining about not being able to see European football,\" writes Emmett Williams, who thinks I have nothing better to do than insert capital letters in his emails for him, because he clearly couldn't be bothered. \"Every match they really want to see is on in a bar somewhere. The only reason I'm not watchingthis is that I'm hard at work at a job that ends next Friday. So if you or the Guardian is hiring ...\" I'd love to help Emmett, but unfortunately we at the Guardian sort of have this policy of only employing folk who know the difference between upper and lower case. Call us picky, but ... 42 mins:GOAL!!! Juventus 2 - 0 Real Madrid (Agg: 3-2) Alessandro Del Piero shimmies his way into the Real Madrid box, wiggles his hips like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, wrongfoots two defenders and then shoots low and hard, beating Casillas at his right-hand post. Half-time: Real Madrid are all over the shop. Their players are bickering with each other, with the referee and with their opposite numbers. Meanwhile Juventus are giving them a lesson in football. I wish they'd give my computer a lesson in decaching quickly. Half-time dissension: This from Ben Keys: \"If I started a website called \"showmoresoccer.com\" and petitioned ESPN to show more soccer (see what he's done there? - BG), instead of their usual fishing and hunting shows, 1989 NBA playoff highlights, early rounds of world's strongest man competitions and women's billiards championships during the day, do you think it would have any effect?\" Eh, in a word ... no. More pedantry: \"Call ME picky, but didn't your English teacher tell you that exclamation marks should be used sparingly, if at all? Certainly not in threes,\" writes Ashley Cotter-Cairns, who doesn't state whether he/she's a he-Ashley or a she-Ashley. Either way, I think it's a bit rich that somebody who needs two surnames is giving out to me for being too profligate with my exclamation marks. The hypocrisy of the posh, I suppose. 45 mins: Real Madrid get the second-half underway. They need to score once to force extra time. 46 mins: Juventus have started the second half as the finished the first, using Nedved and Zambrotta to try and exploit the gaps being left by Roberto Carlos's rampaging forays up the field. They're the first team in the tournament to have managed it so far, so if they pull it off they'll have earned their win. 51 mins: Zambrotta robs the ball off Roberto Carlos deep in his own half and whips in a cross. Casillas gathers. Carlos is having a shocker tonight. For Real Madrid, Ronaldo replaces his compatriot, Flavio Conceicao. 52 mins: Ronaldo pulls off a passable Pippo Inzaghi impersonation by getting needlessly caught offside with his first contribution of the match. 53 mins: Pavel Nedved shoots from distance but doesn't trouble Casillas. Over the bar. 54 mins: Mike Madden (opening whinge) is back and he's opened a can of what can only be described as whup-ass: \"Tell your lower-casing friend Mr. Williams (39 mins) that I'm theoretically hard at work myself, and that American bosses don't understand, much less look kindly upon, employees who sneak off during the day to watch Champions League semi-final return legs.\" I agree wholeheartedly Mike. And what's more, considering Mr Williams's job finishes on Friday he should be able to go and watch the match in a bar if he likes, and to hell with the consequences. What's the worst thing that his boss can do to him if he only has two days left on the job? Juventus win a corner which is swung in to the back post. Casillas comes for it, misses it and flaps hopelessly. Luckily for him, Del Piero fails to make clean contact and the young Real goalkeeper avoids embarrassment. 59 mins: Juve's left-back Birindelli is replaced with Pessotto. A straight swap. 60 mins: After relentless probing and pressure, Zidane, Figo, Salgado and Ronaldo combine to win ... a corner. Ronaldo makes a laughable claim for a penalty, which the referee rightly ignores. Davids clears the corner-kick. 62 mins: Del Piero does well to win the ball on the half-way line and set Trezeguet on his way. Offside. Tacchinardi gets a yellow card for a foul on Cambiasso. it's his eighth of the Champions League campaign. 64 mins: \"I think you can turn off that cache clean-up thing. Not wanting to be too critical of the Guardian IT department, but don't you have someone who can sort these problems out for you chaps?\" writes Brian Potter. You are having a laugh, aren't you Brian? And while you're here, are you the same Brian Potter that runs the eponymous nightclub in Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights? 65 mins: Montero brings down Ronaldo in the Juve penalty area. Penalty for Real Madrid. 66 mins: Gianluigi Buffon saves the most rubbish penalty I've ever seen from Luis Figo. He hit it nowhere near the corner and Buffon had all the time in the world to drop to his right and save it. 68 mins: Here's a thing - assuming he was booked for the challenge that gave away the penalty (it should have been a straight red, as Ronaldo was lcean through on goal) that means Montero has been booked twice in this match and not been sent off. 71 mins: Juve win a free-kick in the Madrid half after Helguera scythes down Trezeguet. It's whipped in to the box, but the Spanish defender atones for his indiscretion by heading clear. 72 mins GOAL: Juventus 3 - 0 Real Madrid (Agg: 4-2) Pavel Nedved latches on to a fantastic Zambrotta pass from the half-way line, sprints between the static Real centre back pairing and buries the ball past Casillas in the Real Madrid goal. Game, set and match. 74 mins: Steve McManaman replaces Somebodyorother on the Real Madrid team. Camoranesi replaces Trezeguet for Juventus. A midfielder for a striker, so Juventus are shutting up shop. Who'd a thunk it? Real Madrid have really been missing their injured midfielder Makelele tonight. 78 mins: Juventus almost bag a fourth, when Del Piero is denied twice in quick succession by two excellent saves by Ikar Casillas. 79 mins: More abuse being hurled in Mike Madden's direction, this time from Tony Long: \"Can Mike Madden explain why he was moaning that the game was not on ESPN if he is too scared of his boss to go and watch it even if it was on?\" he asks, showcasing the kind of irrefutable logic that Matlock himself would be proud of. Thuram dispossesses Ronaldo with a brilliant tackle in the Juventus box. Magnificent defending. 81 mins: Pavel Nedved, who has had an absolute blinder tonight, gets booked for a late tackle on Steve McManaman. He'll miss the final, the poor sod. 82 mins: Real Madrid have all but given up, and are still letting Juve take the game to them. This from John A Hird, the only one of you shower of ingrates that was ever decent enough to send me a present, even if it was only a rip-off $2 Sunderland jersey that he bought in a Saudi flea market: \"Barry, as no-one has had the decency to congratulate you on Sunderland's record breaking season I will,\" he smarms. \"Well done Sunderland and may you go on to break similar records in the Nationwide.\" Thanks John. Kick a man while he's down, why don't you. Luis Figo gets booked. He'll miss the final too, but not because of the yellow card. 86 mins: Raul launches a long basll into the Juventus half which Ronaldo doesn't bother chasing. He's right too. If I had his money, the only things I'd be chasing would be wearing short skirts. Actually, I wouldn't even do that - I'd let them chase me in scenes reminiscent of the closing credits on the Benny Hill show. 88 mins: GOAL!: Juventus 3 - 1 Real Madrid (Agg: 4-3) Zidane pulls one back for Real Madrid, but is it too late? One more will put them in the final, and not Juventus. There'll be five minutes of extra time. 90 mins: Zidane's goal briefly silenced the crowd in Turin. He controlled a ball over the top and, although there was a hint of offside about it, he did well to beat Montero and shoot low past Buffon into the Juventus goal. 90 + 2: Zambrotta, who has switched from the right flank to the left, turns Salgado inside out and buys some time for Juve by winning a corner. Real Madrid clear. 90 + 3: Raul attempts to play in Ronaldo, but Montero steps forward and the overweight, clearly unfit Brazilian is caught offside. 90 + 4 mins: It's over. Juventus have eliminated Real Madrid from the Champions League and will face AC Milan in the first ever all Italian final at Old Trafford in two week's time. All those commentators and pundits are right - the English Premiership really is the best league in the world. Pavel Nedved is distraught. After a brilliant performance, a single act of petulance has cost him his place in the final. Other loose ends: Ashley Cotter-Cairns has written in to confirm that he is in fact a he-Ashley, while Emmett Williams has sent in another one ... two ... three ... four as yet unopened emails to go with the several of earlier. I think it's time you got yourself a life Mr Williams. However, I'm going to stop making fun of him, as apparently his soon-to-be-ex-colleagues are giving him hell over his inability to capitalise. Oh yeah, and Benjamin Keys has started his petition against the Disney Corporation, which I'm putting up here to humour him. You could do the same by signing it. If that doesn't terrify Mouse Inc into showing more footie on ESPN, nothing will.
