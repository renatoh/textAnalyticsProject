There will be no hiding place for any of us \u2013 each MP will have to make a decision. The impact of the Brexit vote has already seen the UK go from being the fastest growing G7 economy to one of the slowest. We represent constituencies that voted both Leave and Remain. Our constituents did not vote to put jobs at risk or to be worse off and they certainly did not expect to pay a \u00a340bn divorce bill without knowing what our future trading relationship with the EU would be. Far from a Brexit dividend, there will be a heavy penalty for the NHS, public health, social care, science and research. This is why the people \u2013 not only their MPs \u2013 must have a say on whether we go through with this. The main party leaders will not commit to putting the decision back to those we represent at this stage. We acknowledge there is not yet a majority in the House of Commons for a necessary cross-party amendment providing for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d at the time of the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on the government\u2019s motion to approve the withdrawal agreement, which takes place in 10 days\u2019 time. And without the support of the leader of the opposition or the prime minister for such a cross-party move it cannot succeed. But this need not be the case. Parliamentary support grows every day and we will keep making the argument. Our principle is simple: the terms of Brexit \u2013 whatever they are \u2013 should be put to the British people to decide whether to proceed on those terms or to keep the current deal we have as a member of the EU. Beyond the large group of MPs who, like us, have publicly backed the campaign, many MPs on all sides have indicated privately they will support a people\u2019s vote if the prime minister\u2019s \u201cdeal\u201d falls. It is clear the prime minister\u2019s plan will not command a majority and so that moment is already upon us \u2013 there is no need to wait and see what is now inevitable. Others wish to resolve this matter through an early general election but it is clear there is not the requisite two-thirds majority in the House for that proposition either. A commitment to supporting a people\u2019s vote amendment in the coming weeks could build further support across parliament. We call on all party leaders and parliament to trust the people with the final say so we can face the future united. The time of the meaningful vote is the only guaranteed opportunity \u2013 written in statute \u2013 for the Commons to back a people\u2019s vote. There may be other opportunities, but whether there are debates and votes in the house is very much in the control of the government. The indications are that the prime minister, within a matter of days of her plan failing to carry the house, will seek to return to the house in a second attempt to get a revised withdrawal agreement through. It is vital, given the speed with which events will unfold, that we do not prevaricate in ensuring that the people are given their rightful seat at the table. If that opportunity is missed, our country and our younger generations in particular \u2013 who stand to lose the most \u2013 will never forgive us. We must not fail to make the case for the people to give their informed consent to the path the UK follows when the moment most demands it.
