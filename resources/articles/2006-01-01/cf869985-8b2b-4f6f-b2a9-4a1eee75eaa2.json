Bethany Usher, 25 was arrested on suspicion of attempting to obtain pecuniary advantage by deception and was taken to Belgravia police station. Ms Usher is understood to have applied for a job as a housekeeping assistant at the palace. It is thought that Ms Usher had already begun working at the palace but police were prompted to make the arrest after checks were made on a CV. News of the World sources are, however, claiming that staff from Ms Usher's former employers, the People, tipped off the Clarence House head of press, Paddy Harveson, about Ms Usher's plan after she moved to the rival tabloid. A People spokeswoman declined to comment on this claim but Ms Usher is thought to have started her investigation while working at the People last year. Mr Harveson refused to be drawn on the claims insisting that he \"would never comment on security matters anyway\". Ms Usher, a former Sunderland Echo reporter, joined the News of the World at the beginning of this month. She was unavailable for comment at the time of publication. A News of the World spokeswoman said: \"Bethany Usher was engaged in a legitimate journalistic exercise investigating security at Buckingham Palace. \"Following questioning she was released having been bailed to return in February.\" A Metropolitan police spokeswoman confirmed that a 25-year-old woman had been arrested at 2pm at Buckingham Palace by officers from the SO14 unit which provide royal protection at the palace. The spokeswoman added that the woman had not been charged. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman also refused to comment. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
