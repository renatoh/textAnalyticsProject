Ten Surrey cricketers stood in empty pose as the game wound down around them. It was left to Adam Hollioake to inject the energy. The Surrey captain bowled with such vigour from the pavilion end that in the last over of the day he was removed from the attack for persistent bouncing, adding a typical Surrey flavour to the lingering death. The game was long drawn, even before 44 overs had been lost to rain, but a hundred spectators were still in their places at 11 o'clock. Why is a question for sociologists but, if fans will come to a wet, dead match at a cavernous ground, four-day county cricket can scoff at the doubters. Those who stayed to the end were treated to dappled sunlight, to Saqlain Mushtaq at ten past five and to an opening stand of 186 from Andy Strauss and Sven Koenig, their highest of the season. Koenig took them past the previous best of 176 with a swept six off Ian Salisbury and celebrated by repeating the shot in the same over. Then Salisbury spoilt the fun. Strauss was caught at leg-slip by Mark Butcher, five short of his century, and Koenig lost concentration too, caught at first slip off Hollioake. Owais Shah and Ben Hutton played the day out. \"We are happy with a draw,\" Strauss, the Middlesex captain, said afterwards. \"On Sunday night we were under a bit of pressure as they came after us trying to win the game but today it was easier because of the rain delays. Playing them shows us the standards we have to reach if we want to win the championship. We have to be a bit smarter.\" Then came the bite. \"I think they could have shown a bit more ambition in the last hour and a half of their innings on Sunday,\" he said of a period of play Surrey might like to forget. With less than half the season gone, Surrey will not be worried yet. But this result leaves them only six points ahead of Sussex. They remain 18 ahead of Lancashire - who have a game in hand on the top two - and take on Essex tomorrow in Chelmsford. Mali Richards, the 19-year-old son of Viv, arrived at Lord's on Sunday from Antigua. He is contracted to Middlesex for the rest of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
