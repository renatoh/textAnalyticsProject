She writes: I have a well-paid job in new media and take home \u00a31,800 a month. My husband and I deal with our money separately, apart from household bills, but we are like Jack Spratt and his wife. His spending and saving patterns are sound and he does not need financial advice, but I do. We recently bought our first house with a 95 per cent mortgage, and a deposit borrowed from my father-in-law. We have worked out a repayment scheme to pay back the deposit and the mortgage, which total \u00a31,051 a month. We have opened a 'mortgage account' and between us we pay in \u00a31,200 a month. That pays both the mortgage and repayments to my father-in-law and we let the excess build up for emergencies such as repairs and as a cushion against any future interest rate rises. So I am putting aside \u00a3600 a month for the mortgage, \u00a3250 into a joint current account for my half-share of bills and food, and \u00a375 a month in a joint savings account which tends to pay for holidays. I have an outstanding credit card balance of \u00a3600, which I am slowly clearing and have reduced by \u00a3700 over the past three months. Apart from the credit card, the mortgage and a student loan, I have no other debt. But neither do I have any savings. However, since I started working about four years ago I have been paying into a pension. My employer contributed to the first one but, now I have moved jobs, I pay in \u00a3200 a month myself. My main question is about saving versus pensions. I am very conscious that I have no savings, not even the recommended three-month salary back-up, but I do have a pension. Which is more important? Should I keep making pension payments, or stop them and put the money instead into a savings fund, or is it worth using the pension money to overpay on my mortgage? Or are there any better ways to organise my money? There's no reason why you can't save Action plan You manage to save for holidays, so there is no reason why you should not handle the rest of your money as efficiently. You might find it easier to become disciplined if you organise your finances with personal finance software such as Microsoft Money or Quicken. It will take time to type in your personal information, but persevere because once done you can quickly see where your money is going, how much you have and what your owe. You can download bank and credit card statements from many banks, create a budget and monitor it, track upcoming bills, calculate how best to repay your debts and play around with 'what if' situations. Microsoft Money (www.microsoft.com/uk/retail) costs \u00a330. Quicken (www.intuit.co.uk/quicken) is introducing a simplified version, Quicken Money Manager, in early June for about \u00a319. Check the internet for the lowest prices. Before deciding whether to divert some of your pension contributions into savings, make sure your outgoings are as low as possible and concentrate on paying off your most expensive debt, the credit card. Anna Bowes, savings manager of Bath-based adviser Chase de Vere, suggests you stop spending on the credit card. 'Cut it up and transfer the outstanding balance to a card charging 0 per cent interest.' Philippa Gee, investments director of Wolverhampton-based Torquil Clark, suggests checking that you are on the cheapest mortgage rate. She adds: 'Emily should look closely at her bank statement in case she is still paying standing orders she thought had stopped.' Make sure you are earning the best rate of interest on your savings. Gee recommends ING Direct paying 4.5 per cent gross or a mini-cash Isa such as Safeway's at 4.35 per cent tax-free. Gee believes that, for your age, you are paying quite heavily into your pension and points out: 'She will be more comfortable than most when she retires but pensions are a long-term investment. She cannot draw out money in an emergency so needs to have more cash in a flexible plan.' She suggests you open a savings account separate from the holiday fund: 'Ideally she should pay in the same as she is paying into her pension, in addition to the pension contributions, as she should by now have found ways to cut her costs.' Bowes recommends checking where your pension money from your previous employer is invested: 'It may be possible to invest in a similar plan with lower charges. As Emily has a long time until retirement, she can afford to take more risk.' Alan Hardy, head of investments at LloydsTSB Private Banking, explains that pension contributions made when young give best value but adds: 'In the real world everyone has to make choices about jam today or jam tomorrow. Overpaying into the mortgage account will help build up an emergency fund and she should aim for a fund equal to six months' mortgage repayments.' Check if you have a stakeholder pension because these allow you to change your contributions without penalty, says Hardy. 'If so, she doesn't need to have an all-or-nothing approach to pension or savings because she can top up her pension payments as and when she can afford it.' Or you could open a stocks and shares Isa as part of your pension plan, knowing that you can get at the money if necessary. Bowes believes: 'She should start saving in a cash Isa but, once this has built up, she can be more adventurous with some equity holdings in an Isa, perhaps a UK equity income fund such as Jupiter or Framlington. These involve leaving the money for seven or eight years so are less flexible than deposit accounts.' A final piece of advice from Hardy: 'Both Emily and her husband should check if their employers provide life insurance and sick pay.' If not, they will need insurance to pay off the mortgage if one of them dies or lost income through ill health. Emily's to-do list 1. Transfer your credit card to a 0 per cent interest deal. 2. Stop using the credit card and repay the debt fast. 3. Make sure your outgoings are as low as possible and keep monitoring interest rates. 4. Start saving for an emergency fund of at least three times your monthly salary, initially with a cash Isa. 5. Then switch your savings into stock-market related investments for medium-term saving or eventually to supplement your pension. 6. Keep your pension payments going. 7.
