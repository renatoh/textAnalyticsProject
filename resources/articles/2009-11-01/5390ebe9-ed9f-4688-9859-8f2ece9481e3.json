The result means Hibs are now level on points with the Ibrox club in second place in the Scottish Premier League after their 2-0 victory over Falkirk, two points behind Celtic. The Dons took the lead after 17 minutes when striker Lee Miller reacted smartly to prod home a Michael Paton driven cross for his third goal of the season. Mark McGhee's team were reduced to 10 men on the hour mark when captain Mark Kerr was shown a second yellow card. The Gers threw everything at Aberdeen but the battling home side managed to withstand the pressure to earn a win. A Derek Riordan double earned Hibernian victory against Falkirk. The Scotland forward struck a sweet volley after 33 minutes with the aid of a deflection off Bairns centre-back Brian McLean, before settling the outcome two minutes from time. Motherwell and Dundee United drew 2-2 at Fir Park. Jon Daly continued his comeback from serious injury by earning nine-man United a point. Well looked in control after recovering from Andy Webster's early opener to lead through John Sutton and Lukas Jutkiewicz, but Daly levelled in the 83rd minute despite Prince Buaben's earlier red card. Danny Swanson followed him down the tunnel in the 87th minute before Nicky Weaver earned United a point with a fabulous late save. Christian Nad\u00e9's second goal in as many matches proved to be the winner as Hearts secured their first league victory in six games, winning 2-1 at Kilmarnock. Eggert Jonsson opened the scoring in the second half, and Nad\u00e9 added the visitors' second 11 minutes later. Kevin Kyle missed an 87th-minute penalty for Killie, who dominated the first half and had a goal ruled offside, before Craig Bryson scored their consolation a minute later An equaliser from Filipe Morais ensured St Johnstone shared a 1-1 draw with fellow SPL strugglers Hamilton Accies. Hamilton's on-loan Dundee striker Micka\u00ebl Antoine-Curier had given the visitors the lead in the 24th minute when he bundled in a Richard Hastings corner. However, Accies' advantage was to last only five minutes, as Morais headed in a Kevin Moon cross to restore parity in a game of few clear-cut chances. Saints pressed hard for the winner in the closing stages but their Lanarkshire opponents held out for a precious point in a frantic finale."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
