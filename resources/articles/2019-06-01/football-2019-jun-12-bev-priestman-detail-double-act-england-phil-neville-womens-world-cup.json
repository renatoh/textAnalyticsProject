Her name is Bev Priestman, she grew up in Consett, County Durham and, as a teenager, attended virtually every training session presided over by a bright young university lecturer and part-time futsal coach called John Herdman. When Herdman landed a big break and emigrated to New Zealand to work for that country\u2019s football association, Priestman \u2013 by then a University of Liverpool graduate who had played for Mo Marley\u2019s Everton \u2013 followed him, literally to the other side of the world. The pair would later move to Canada where, among assorted development roles, Priestman served as Herdman\u2019s first lieutenant in his job as manager of the women\u2019s national team. Once her mentor took charge of the country\u2019s senior men\u2019s side last year, their paths finally diverged. It made her the perfect partner for Neville as England\u2019s coach sought a talented, trustworthy assistant but the switch has proved quite a culture shock. \u201cJohn and Phil are very different,\u201d says the 33-year-old Priestman, who is being cheered on in France by her wife, Emma, and their baby. \u201cThey\u2019ve been on very different paths. Phil\u2019s a world-class man-manager, he\u2019s worked under the best manager in history [Sir Alex Ferguson], he\u2019s played the game at the top level and nothing fazes him. In contrast, John\u2019s had a lot of experience of a lot of tournaments and he\u2019s detailed; my background has been along that Herdman path so you put me and Phil together and I hope it\u2019ll bring England success. \u201cPhil and I complement each other. Phil\u2019s the most open guy I\u2019ve ever met. He\u2019s also a humble guy, who probably doesn\u2019t reference his Manchester United experiences as much as he should. He recognises my experience and draws on it. I\u2019ve brought experience of tournaments so when you get to the games that really matter, seven games in and after 50 days on the road, the players are still fresh and ready. I also know how Fifa works. That, and my knowledge of other countries and how they play, are probably the areas where I\u2019ve helped.\u201d It seems that, if Neville is the strategist, Priestman takes care of the small print. \u201cYou have to allow him the time to concentrate on [man-management] and not get bogged down in the details,\u201d she says. \u201cIt means he can get the best out of every player.\u201d Priestman is talking at a resort hotel on the Normandy coast where England are preparing for Friday\u2019s game with Argentina in Le Havre. By way of relaxation she joins Neville for 6am beach runs. \u201cSometimes you think: \u2018Should it be sleep or exercise?\u2019 but it\u2019s a big part of the staff culture and that all starts from the top,\u201d she says. \u201cPhil can get a bit hardcore with his hill sprints, though \u2026 I got lost on the first run here \u2026\u201d Neville\u2019s enthusiasm appears boundless. \u201cI can see the excitement in his eyes,\u201d Priestman says. \u201cHe\u2019s played in Champions Leagues and everything but I believe him when he says this World Cup is the biggest thing he\u2019s ever done. He eats, sleeps and breathes the Lionesses. The girls feel that and they will run through brick walls for him. He\u2019s a laid-back guy but he\u2019s also passionate and he\u2019ll put the work in. The girls know it and that\u2019s important.\u201d It also helps that England\u2019s manager is highly emotionally intelligent and does not seem remotely puzzled by female players\u2019 penchant for asking \u201cWhy?\u201d much more than their male counterparts. \u201cPhil\u2019s quite unique in that he\u2019s got great intuition and gut feel,\u201d Priestman says. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed women have emotional intelligence, that they understand women. But I think the fact Phil has a twin sister, Tracey, and she\u2019s in netball [as England coach] means he\u2019s got a really good gut instinct too. He\u2019s been around his sister and netball a lot and it\u2019s given him a good feel for things.\u201d Given Priestman\u2019s long association with Herdman \u2013 a sports psychology specialist particularly focused on mental health problems \u2013 her insights carry added weight. She is especially impressed by Neville\u2019s willingness to listen. \u201cPhil will tap into people around him,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s really good at saying: \u2018Bev what do you think?\u2019 He does the same with veteran players like Jill Scott, Karen Carney as well as the captain [Steph Houghton]. It\u2019s quite a two-way harmony. \u201cTo succeed, you have to know your tactics but you also need team spirit, togetherness and a winning mindset and Phil has really brought those. As long as the mindset is right, we can achieve great things.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
