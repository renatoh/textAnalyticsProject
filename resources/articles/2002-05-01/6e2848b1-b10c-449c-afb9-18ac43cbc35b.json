The reason for this is the constant pressure to adapt to external directives. At the moment we are implementing the \"key stage 3 strategy\" intended to promote pupil performance in English, maths and science during the first three years of secondary school, years 7, 8 and 9. At the end of that period, key stage 3 is rounded off when year 9 pupils across the country sit standard assessment tests (SATs). All of this means catch-up classes for those arriving in our intake year (year 7, most of whom are or will be age 12 during this year); mentoring for year 8, and \"booster classes\" for year 9. We have also had to review our curriculum for the years involved, and in particular literacy and numeracy. Simultaneously, staff are teaching new GCSE syllabuses, introduced in September 200I. To complete the load, this is only the second year of the new post age 16 curriculum; those in their senior year will, under the new A-level system, be the first cohort to take A2s. What no one realises is that in a small school, one teacher could be involved in all these new approaches. Also the training schedule means staff are out of school, and finding adequate supply cover is difficult. Waiting in the wings is the review of the age I4-I9 curriculum, which will involve yet more change. No one on the policy end ever seems to look back and ask if the changes made things better or worse. The reform to A levels is a classic case of poorly implemented change. Teacher workload is not my only concern. Assessment now takes up an inordinate amount of time. The summer exam timetable stretches from May 13 until the end of June. The last three years of secondary school - years 11, 12 and 13 - are all being examined. Year 9 take their SATs [national standard assessment tests] in the second week of May, so only years 7, 8 and 10 are being taught. The pressure on students is immense and there is less time for teaching and learning because examinations are always looming. Money is also an issue. This year, post age 16 education is funded by the Learning Skills Council. Our local education authority had to reduce the age weighted formula for pupils aged 11-16 to cope with this new funding pattern and admitted it was all a \"fudge\" this year. In the money my school gets from out local education authority, there is a mere \u00a330,000 for capital building. I need \u00a32m-3m to replace all the \"temporary\" mobile classrooms on site. I see little prospect of being able to achieve a major rebuild. There are too many sources of funding for which bids have to be written and submitted. Many require matched funding, which implies access to local businesses willing to collaborate. Funding for \"performance management\" is also inadequate. Then there is ICT. The list is endless. In spite of everything I really love my job and teaching is the best profession. I just wish I could persuade more of my students to choose to become teachers. If I had one wish it would be to be left alone for a year to consolidate all the initiatives; to have the freedom and time to reflect on what we are doing, to take some risks and to break free from the crushing burden of direction from above. The Department for Education now don't bombard us with paper; it is much more subtle these days. Each month schools receive a publication called Spectrum with a list of websites to visit. I came into teaching because I loved my subject, I liked working with young people and it was a respected profession. I still love the teaching and working with young people but I am disappointed with the image of the profession. It would boost morale if just for once teachers could be told that they are doing a good job. All we ever see is the negative side, or we are told there is yet another task we need to do or are doing badly. Teachers cannot be held accountable for all the ills of society."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
