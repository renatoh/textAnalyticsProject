We\u2019ve put so much work in\u2019", "bodyText": "Four years ago Nikita Parris was in Egypt, being woken up in the early hours by her mum to watch England play at the World Cup in Canada. \u201cIt was sometimes 1.30am over there,\u201d she says. \u201cI got on the laptop in my hotel room. Myself, my mum and my sister all crowding around, watching it, hoping the wifi was strong enough. \u201cThey would wake me up. My mum would say: \u2018Nikita, time to get up, the game\u2019s on in half an hour \u2026\u2019 My mum was my alarm clock. She\u2019s always been there for me.\u201d It would have been a shock if Parris, who last month joined the Champions League winners Lyon from Manchester City, had been omitted from Phil Neville\u2019s squad this time. But four years ago it was a different story. \u201cI just narrowly missed out,\u201d she says. \u201cMark [Sampson, the previous England manager] brought me in to the squad to be a training player, 10 days leading into the World Cup. For me, at that moment, I really took it all in. \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t going but I wanted to make sure all the girls going into the tournament were best prepared to push on. I went into the training camp to make sure they had the sort of test they were going to get from the American forwards, French forwards, Canadian forwards; to make sure that in those moments of pressure they knew they had already done it in training against me. Mark spoke to me after that and he said I would be a massive part of his plans.\u201d Despite having no expectations, missing out hurt. \u201cIt was massively disappointing but I respected his decision because I hadn\u2019t been around the squad for long enough,\u201d says Parris, now the leading scorer in Women\u2019s Super League history. \u201cI hadn\u2019t really shown what I was capable of. I didn\u2019t have that length of time to show anyone.\u201d The way she was told mattered. Neville has spoken extensively in the buildup to this tournament about his frustrations with how he was told as a player he was not going to World Cups. If Sampson had got it wrong, Parris might not be about to embark on her second major tournament. \u201cMark and I sat down,\u201d she says. \u201cHe had hot chocolate. I had a coffee. I remember the moment because ultimately it determined to me which way I would go. Would I give up or would I knuckle down and ensure I made the next World Cup or the Euros? That\u2019s what my plans were. I knew I would break into it if I put everything into it and put my best foot forward.\u201d This season Parris has helped Manchester City to a domestic cup double and chased Arsenal\u2019s Vivianne Miedema for the Golden Boot in the league but eventually finished three goals behind on 19. The 25-year-old\u2019s challenge now is to make sure she is mentally ready for the world stage. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019ve experienced before but ultimately I don\u2019t really think of that,\u201d Parris says. \u201cMy whole thought process going into this is that I\u2019m best prepared, no matter what the moment is, and to really show what I can do. I\u2019ve got friends, teammates around me to make sure I don\u2019t overthink the situation.\u201d Dealing with the expectations of a nation is hard, but she welcomes the pressure. \u201cI think they should be excited,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have got a lot of quality, a lot of different talents and great depth. Each and every game could be different. The gaffer isn\u2019t afraid to mix up the squad and it will bring a different element. It\u2019s an exciting time for English football.\u201d With the team having made two semi-finals in four years, in Canada and at Euro 2017, the pressure is high. Parris, though, throws the 2009 Euros finals into the mix too. \u201cThe girls in \u201909 won silver \u2013 it\u2019s time for gold. \u201cWe\u2019re under no illusions how hard that is going to be. We\u2019ve put so much hard work in. Our journey has not been easy but we played some of the best teams in the world on American soil in the SheBelieves and came out winners so we have it in us to compete. We\u2019re ready for it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
