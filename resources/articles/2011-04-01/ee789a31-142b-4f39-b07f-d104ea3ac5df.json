Ms Adams, who won \u00a35,000 and a 10-day, all-inclusive holiday to St Lucia, is more than just a racing fan. The 34-year-old, who is a racehorse owner and has worked as a professional Naomi Campbell lookalike, has won other best-dressed competitions in the past, and was recently announced as the face of the Racing Lottery, launched by Racing Welfare to raise funds for British stable staff. Rummy attracts the crowds Red Rum's headstone, opposite the winning post in front of the stands, attracted a steady stream of visitors during the week.

Aintree also found that hospitality sales fared surprisingly well in the financial circumstances , marketing bosses having moved away from promoting the old-fashioned corporate box routine to selling packages at the meeting as 'racing with dining' for small groups. Coleen goes missing for fashion stakes Coleen Rooney, wife of Manchester United star Wayne, never misses Ladies Day' on the Friday at Aintree's National meeting and the queen of the WAGs was, as ever, in position this year. But she was missed over at the fashion stage, where she has worked for the Matt Haylerpast couple of years, because her advertising contract with Littlewoods prevented her from being associated with Matalan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
