Buttonholing the movie\u2019s producer, Harvey Weinstein, he pitched him an adaptation he had written of Stephen Benatar\u2019s amnesia thriller Recovery. \u201cHe told me to get it to his hotel suite by 6am and he\u2019d read it on the plane home,\u201d Fitzherbert recalls. \u201cThen I got a call from his New York office saying he loved it and I thought: \u2018I\u2019m going to be an overnight success!\u2019 I was summoned to a meeting with his senior exec in London, given \u2018notes\u2019, which I worked on for months \u2013 and never heard from any of them again. As people say, it\u2019s not the rejections that kill you, it\u2019s the hope.\u201d Nearly two decades later, Fitzherbert finally moved decisively from reviewing to screenwriting when two of his scripts \u2013 the historical drama Born a King and the horror-comedy Slaughterhouse Rulez, co-written with the former Kula Shaker frontman Crispian Mills \u2013 went into production in 2017. Though, as he points out, the career change was \u201cnot by choice but design: the paper had let me go\u201d. Rather satisfyingly, the first day of principal photography on Born a King happened to coincide with his final one as a reviewer. \u201cI left the screening room in Soho, drove to Hatfield House and walked on to the set of my debut film where a cast and crew of 200 were bringing my screenplay to life on an extraordinary scale. I couldn\u2019t have dreamed up a better \u2018fuck you\u2019 to the paper.\u201d If a time machine were to transport passengers back to the Soho screening rooms of the 90s, they would find sitting in the dark alongside Fitzherbert some of the figures who now make the films we watch. There would be Lizzie Francke, the former Sight &amp; Sound critic who is a senior development and production executive at BFI Film Fund, where she has helped shepherd to the screen titles including The Souvenir, Cold War and You Were Never Really Here. With her would be her Sight &amp; Sound colleague John Wrathall, whose screenwriting credits include the Holocaust drama Good, starring Viggo Mortensen and Jodie Whittaker, and the forthcoming Dickens update Twist with Michael Caine as Fagin. Quentin Curtis, the Telegraph critic who went on to produce Legend, with Tom Hardy as the Kray twins, as well as Ridley Scott\u2019s All the Money in the World, would be in attendance. So too would the late Gilbert Adair, whose novel Love and Death on Long Island had already been adapted for cinema when he became film critic of the Independent on Sunday; several years later, he scripted The Dreamers (based on his novel The Holy Innocents) for Bernardo Bertolucci. Mark Cousins would be present, too, in the days before he directed ambitious, passionate documentaries such as The Story of Film. Edward Lawrenson, deputy editor of Sight &amp; Sound and later film critic at The Big Issue, was also a regular attendee, and continued reviewing even once Abandoned Goods, the documentary he co-directed with Pia Borg, won the Golden Leopard prize at Locarno in 2014. \u201cI probably became a worse critic around that time,\u201d laughs Lawrenson. \u201cI\u2019m sure if you looked back at the reviews I did while we were making Abandoned Goods, you\u2019d find they got a lot more sympathetic. Flaws in a film became understandable to me rather than a reason to get upset. In a way, that\u2019s partly why I had to stop. I wasn\u2019t providing a very good service. I was just liking everything.\u201d Fitzherbert has a different reason for lamenting his reviews: \u201cI found some of them the other day and was shocked at what a smart-arse I sounded like. As a critic, I used to think I knew it all, but as a screenwriter I\u2019m learning every day.\u201d But Francke has less cause for embarrassment. \u201cIn the last few years Sight &amp; Sound has republished some of the reviews I was proud of, such as The Silence of the Lambs and The Piano, so perhaps that showed some younger film-makers: \u2018Oh, she does know what she\u2019s talking about.\u2019\u201d It is in this capacity that she feels her previous career makes her especially helpful to directors. \u201cOne of my first industry jobs was looking at first features and I still do a lot of that. At the end of meetings, I\u2019ll feel like a doctor handing out prescriptions: \u2018Take two Renoirs and come back in a fortnight.\u2019 My knowledge is useful, not as one-upmanship but to share a delight in the possibilities of film language. I say to people: \u2018Think about whether your work is having a dialogue with film history.\u2019 It\u2019s like being a young tennis player and having a go with Andy Murray. You can look at these great pieces of cinema and think: \u2018What muscles can I work on to improve my own skills as a film-maker?\u2019\u201d The Brazilian director Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho, whose films include the deranged new western Bacurau, is another former critic who believes his original profession has stood him in good stead behind the camera. \u201cMy tendency is never to separate the \u2018critic\u2019 and \u2018film-maker\u2019 parts of myself,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey are all part of the same sensitivity. Sometimes I\u2019ll be on festival juries talking with someone who is exclusively an actor or screenwriter, and on those occasions I feel my training as a critic gives me a different kind of openness and understanding. Whereas other people are more pragmatic about their reactions: \u2018This is terrible, I hate it.\u2019 I never really enjoyed the power that was put in my hands as a critic. It was never about that. And I could never be negative about critics now. Reading reviews of my films is an interesting emotional and intellectual exercise \u2013 even the bad ones.\u201d Receiving criticism rather than dishing it out, though, can be one of the less enjoyable aspects for the poacher turned gamekeeper. \u201cIt\u2019s like pushing a pram around so critics can comment on your baby,\u201d says Fitzherbert. \u201cSome coo, others say: \u2018What the hell is that?\u2019\u201d Francke remembers the world premiere of the first movie she worked on, the psychological horror Trauma starring Colin Firth, at the Sundance film festival. \u201cYou could feel it not connecting with the audience. I felt sick. Then it got mixed reviews. But whether a review is good or bad, I just want something well-argued. Sometimes I\u2019ll even read a critic and think: \u2018You\u2019ve said all the things I tried to say to the film-maker!\u2019\u201d The path from writing about movies to making them is a well-trodden one. Some critics, notably the Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma crowd, including Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, have even had a profound effect on cinema history. Prior to spearheading the French New Wave, they bestowed hallowed auteur status on Alfred Hitchcock among others; this may sound like a no-brainer today, but it was only a few years earlier that Lindsay Anderson, also poised to switch from criticism to directing, had cast aspersions on him. \u201cHitchcock has never been a \u2018serious\u2019 director,\u201d he wrote in Sequence magazine in 1949. \u201cHis films are interesting neither for their ideas nor for their characters.\u201d In some cases, a critic\u2019s bad reviews have led unexpectedly to a new career path. In his capacity as film critic at the Spectator in the 1930s, Graham Greene put the boot into several pictures produced by Alexander Korda. Rather magnanimously, Korda asked Greene whether he had any stories that might make a suitable film; the result was the 1937 revenge thriller The Green Cockatoo. An olive branch was also responsible for starting the screenwriting career of Frank S Nugent, film critic at the New York Times during the same period. Nugent\u2019s mockery of the actor Tyrone Power prompted 20th Century Fox to withdraw its advertising from the paper, although this didn\u2019t prevent Darryl F Zanuck, the vice-president in charge of production at the studio, from hiring him as a script doctor. \u201cZanuck told me he didn\u2019t want me to write, he just thought the studio would save money if I criticised the pictures before they were made,\u201d said Nugent, who ended up writing or co-writing 11 movies for John Ford, including Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and The Searchers. It was Paul Schrader, another esteemed critic turned screenwriter, who was responsible for giving The Searchers a 70s makeover in Taxi Driver. Schrader had reviewed movies for the LA Free Press, where his take-down of Easy Rider got him fired, and had written Transcendental Style in Film, a highly regarded book about Yasujir\u014d Ozu, Robert Bresson, and Carl Dreyer. He had then incurred the wrath of his powerful mentor, Pauline Kael, by declining a reviewing job she had wangled for him in favour of focusing on screenwriting. Kael\u2019s own brush with film-making was less fulfilling than that of her protege. At the invitation of Warren Beatty, she relinquished her post at the New Yorker in 1979 to develop projects for Paramount. \u201cMy thinking was influenced by the Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma guys,\u201d Beatty said. \u201cTo me, it seemed like a natural progression, film criticism to film production.\u201d Some have seen it as an attempt to muzzle and neutralise Kael. \u201cWarren is the master of patient seduction,\u201d noted Schrader. \u201cHe is also the master of patient revenge. In manipulating Pauline, the critical bete noire of commercial Hollywood, he accomplished both.\u201d A year after arriving on the Paramount lot, she was back at the New Yorker. The traffic from page to screen hasn\u2019t abated, with Jay Cocks (the Time critic who co-wrote three Scorsese movies, including Silence, and did uncredited work on Titanic) and Olivier Assayas (the Cahiers contributor who directed Irma Vep and Personal Shopper) among those making the journey. Return trips are unheard of, although Francke says she still experiences the impulse to be a cheerleader for outstanding work. \u201cSometimes I see a film, like Garrett Bradley\u2019s Time, which was at Sundance this year, or Kitty Green\u2019s The Assistant, and I think: \u2018That would be such a delight to champion!\u2019\u201d She has a new perspective on her old job, and feels that critics should exercise their judgments responsibly. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to be clever and witty and snide, as I\u2019m sure I was in my 20s. And it\u2019s open season to be rude about a Michael Bay film. But if it\u2019s a first-time director, you just think: \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d Fitzherbert believes his old colleagues could spare a bit more thought about the film-making process. \u201cThis is no fault of critics, but they simply never know what went on behind the scenes \u2013 the compromises, the craziness, the drastic last-minute budget cuts \u2013 which means they frequently misapportion blame, usually to the poor old director. They write simmering with exasperation and indignation, as I frequently did, and you just want to scream: \u2018It\u2019s not that simple!\u2019\u201d Bacurau is available now on Mubi"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
