Let cereal decide ...", "bodyText": "I'm pretty sure I am very bad at making decisions, because even committing to that opening thought causes my brain to rattle. Having to choose from a breathtaking array of cultural events in the world's biggest arts festival can hardly be considered a circle of hell, but if you're prone to option paralysis, the Fringe brochure is 300 pages of at least mild torture. It cannot be fully known or finished, that's the problem - you may as well set out to read the complete works of the internet. And whatever choice you make instantly tarnishes, leaving everything you didn't select twinkling: look at what you could have won. So I am surrendering all my choices for a day. Time to get fate on board. I'm off to five shows, and having nothing to do with choosing them. This must be about the music of chance. I may end up with nothing but a plate of theatrical slop but that doesn't matter. The important thing is: it won't be my fault. Cereal selection If you clear the first choice hurdle of the day - shall I get up? - with a yes, this is a good way of getting out of the house. Tear random pages out of the brochure and spread them over the living room floor. Stand in the middle with a handful of corn flakes and throw them everywhere. Approach one flake and, if the show it lands on is on, go to it. I get Global Snoring by Conscious Theatre, at C Baraka venue. \"Warning,\" it says, \"flyers recycled from elephant poo.\" I'm elated - not about the poo, especially, but because I have become someone with a plan. I know what I am doing and there is no doubt in my mind. As it turns out the show isn't on, and the performance in its place is not even in the brochure. Blimey, fate is well on the ball. Transformation, the show in its place, turns out to be the brutally heart-on-sleeve life story of Gemskii, who dances and narrates a litany of drug abuse, suicide attempts, rape and recovery. The scars on her body verify various episodes. I would never have gone to this - any description of the show would reek of live therapy - but I'm glad I saw Transformation, a harrowing story told without self-pity, and an unlikely thread of humour. I tell Gemskii how I got to the show and she is touched, as the line, \"Destiny, the little minx, has other ideas\" keeps coming back in the piece. Meghan, a Canadian sitting in front of me, got a free ticket the day before and loved it so much she came back and paid - that's how she decided. Sheep tactics This method has to be practised with a little discipline. Basically you walk up to the box office of one of the big, multi-venue places such as Pleasance, and say: \"I'll have whatever the last person ordered.\" Try to blinker yourself on the approach, otherwise you will get paralysed with prejudice, wondering whether it is a good idea to follow in the footsteps of a man wearing a piano tie. I get Mervyn Stutters' Pick of the Fringe. I only really clock the first part of the title, and a few minutes in, as Mervyn is shambling round a medley of Beatles tunes reworked to goad Heather and Paul, my heart sinks. I can't take an hour of \"I look at Paul the lonely Beatle\" and \"She said hello, she said goodbye\" with a guitar backing. But that's soon out of the way, and he introduces bite-size performances from various acts, such as Chicken Shed, Mark Watson and Tom Tom Club. I desperately need to look into the mouth of Tom Tom's beatbox guy. It's outrageous what he can do with a microphone, unless he has five tongues. Dramatic text Get a friend to text you a number between 10 and 237, and go to the corresponding page in the Fringe guide. You may then need a couple of further numbers to decide which column and entry to go to, but eventually you will get it down to a single show. Please, please let it be the show with free sex and booze and money, assuming there is one. Ten minutes later, having run across town, there I am: a grown man on his own, pleading to be let into James Campbell's Onomatopoeia Society III: The Vegetarian Amputation Project - a world premiere in the children's section, suitable for ages six and up. The awkwardness of this late entry to the small theatre (I have to climb over a baby to get in) is compounded by the fact that once I get to a seat, my body starts dealing with the recent jog and sweat pours down my face. Not a good look at a children's show. I whip out my pad in the hope that some note-taking will save face, but the cast are saying \"oohplop\" and \"wooblewibblishness\", so this doesn't help. It is further worrying just how much I like the show. I would like to think this is because of the well-judged adult treats (A mole saying, \"We can't see the audience, there's a fourth wall in this place\"), the Clockwork Orange tone of the onomatopoeic script (\"You just blahed that something happened with the doodoodoo\"), Glenn Wool's wonderfully deadpan performance as Spiral Manly. But maybe I just love poo-bum-wee talk and grown-ups dressed as animals. Ask a sheep Seizing the moment, I ask Tiffany, one of the sheep in the children's show, to help with my next move. She says, enigmatically: \"The letter R.\" The first usable R in the index of the brochure is Rachel Glover and Ailsa Johnston, who are doing a show called Two Birds - One Ticket, in what feels like a tiny conference suite on the seventh floor of the Jury's Inn hotel. En route I ask a couple how they have made a choice for a show they are going to at the Assembly Rooms, and get a bracingly honest reply: \"Well, it has themes that are relevant to us. It's about adultery.\" That's nice. Two Birds - One Ticket has an audience of around 25, and feels like a hen night sprinkled with anxious men. One of the two women is a character comic who plays a waitress, the other a stand-up, and they take half the show each. The waitress's trick is to start very thoughtfully in her songs, but make the last line something like: \"Fuck off you twat because I'm 30 seconds away from glassing you.\" A song having a go at ginger men draws the biggest laugh, because of the very ginger man in the front row. He shoulders the humiliation manfully, and his wife pats him on the head. Maybe this is what lots of blokey stand-up feels like for women. Just hope someone else sorts it all out As I consider my next move, the phone rings. A friend has got me a ticket for Trumptonshire Tales, with Brian Cant and Phill Jupitus. Hearing Cant being interviewed, and watching clips from Trumpton and Camberwick Green, brings a lump to my throat, as it does for all the thirtysomethings in the room. Those were simpler times, where you just had to choose between three TV channels, or between the three windows in Play School - times where the biggest decision for the fire brigade in Trumpton was how to get the mayor's hat out of a tree. I bet Windy Miller hasn't got broadband. The show ends, the random experiment is over. I am snapped out of my childhood by daylight - and a question from my friend: \"What do you want to do now?\" Oh no, here we go again ...
