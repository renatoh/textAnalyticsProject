It is believed that GSK may be looking to cut its global workforce of 105,000 by up to 10,000 but yesterday the company declined to be drawn on how many jobs would be lost in the latest phase of its restructuring. \"In line with previous practice we will not be providing targets for job reductions and we will announce restructuring outcomes once employees, relevant works councils and trade unions have been consulted and informed,\" GSK said in a statement accompanying full-year figures. However, the company said it expected the majority of the job losses would be outside the UK. The savings this year would mitigate an expected decline in gross margins as a result of product mix changes and support further investment in the company's strategic priorities Yesterday's jobs warning from GSK was the latest in a series from the drugs industry. AstraZeneca said last week it was cutting 6,000 jobs, while Pfizer is expecting to reduce employment numbers following its planned acquisition of Wyeth. GSK said pre-tax profits after restructuring costs of \u00a31.12bn amounted to \u00a36.7bn last year, compared with \u00a37.5bn in 2007, when restructuring costs were \u00a3338m. Andrew Witty, the chief executive, described 2008 as a turning point for the company. \"Those factors which impacted our performance, in particular declines in Avandia sales, are now starting to reduce. [Last year] also saw the first steps towards a radical transformation of our business model.\" GSK had clearly improved the productivity of its research and development process but it was crucial to continue reducing \"cyclicality\" and turning out a steady stream of products. GSK shares traded lower for much of the day but recovered to end up 9p at \u00a312.77."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
