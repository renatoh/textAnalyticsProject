She returned 15 minutes later to the bookstore\u2019s \u201crare room\u201d, where she spoke alongside writer Will Schwalbe about her controversial new book Outrages: Sex, Censorship and the Criminalization of Love. The American edition of the book is not yet on sale, as her US publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt pulled it to make corrections after she was criticized during a press interview for incorrectly understanding historical facts. BBC Radio 3 host Matthew Sweet noted during their interview that Wolf misunderstood the legal term \u201cdeath recorded\u201d as homosexual men being prosecuted and executed during the Victorian era, in reference to the Obscene Publications Act of 1857. Wolf said she was thankful for the correction and posted shortly after on Twitter the book would be released in the US after changing the misunderstanding on two pages. \u201cFollowing an interview on BBC which raised questions about certain parts of my book, I made necessary changes immediately,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. This talk at the Strand was clearly to set the record straight. After a pleasant introduction, where she was cited as being avant-garde for writing her Guardian article from 2007, Fascist America in 10 easy steps, Schwalbe dived into the issue , asking Wolf about the BBC interview. What happened? \u201cI had read death recorded as meaning death recorded,\u201d she said. \u201cThe death penalty was the law of the land until 1861, [but] I misunderstood the phrase. Sweet pointed out an 1823 act that allowed judges to report a death without actually sentencing the person to death.\u201d But it didn\u2019t come without a rebuttal. \u201cThere\u2019s questions about his definitions. Some people disagree,\u201d added Wolf. \u201cSome things he said in the interview I don\u2019t agree with. The bottom line is that he did me a favor by identifying a misreading that I corrected.\u201d In a tit for tat, she targeted inaccuracies in the news reports about her own mistake. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of coverage on these two inaccuracies, and there have been inaccuracies in the coverage as well,\u201d said Wolf. That includes news reports that claim there was \u201ca long awkward silence\u201d when Sweet showed her a newspaper clipping to back up his argument that countered her own. \u201cThe internet interpreted that as my humiliation, my shocked horror,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, I was pausing because his newspaper clipping had anomalies where the ages of the youths and the trial dates were different. I was pausing because I was trying to understand what those anomalies were.\u201d The Strand is selling the UK version of the book while the US edition of the book is awaiting corrections. Wolf will be adding what she calls \u201ca real foregrounding of the scholars whose work I draw on, to give a picture of sentencing for sodomy-related offences,\u201d she said. That includes the works of three scholars, among them Charles Upchurch, a history professor at Florida State University who wrote a book called Before Wilde: Sex Between Men in Britain\u2019s Age of Reform, which traces how the British government started policing same-sex love. While Sweet said \u201cseveral dozen executions\u201d was incorrect, Wolf claims the scholars use trial records and newspaper records to cite thousands of arrests. Apparently, Charles \u201cfound hundreds of trials and reports of trials\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not just what we know what these scholars have found. It was difficult times before the trial of Oscar Wilde and same sex intimacy,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cMy focus is not a criminological take. My focus is the effect on Symonds and his friends reading about these trials.\u201d Beyond the mishap, Wolf urges people to read the book and judge for themselves. It\u2019s an obscure gay love story squared on the life of English writer John Addington Symonds, who she feels was a forgotten hero that promoted gay life. \u201cIt\u2019s about what\u2019s lost to LGBTQ history that you have to dig for,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are huge swaths of history we don\u2019t get in school or college with feminist history and the gay rights movement, unless we seek it out.\u201d As a well-heeled critic, writer and poet, Symonds had a way for obfuscating his desire for men in words. \u201cSymonds became self-censoring,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cPoetry about sodomy had a legal valiance, his prose became opaque. There was a coded language.\u201d Early on, he married a woman but wrote about its failure. \u201cHe didn\u2019t desire her and the loneliness in this marriage became a prison of repression,\u201d said Wolf. Alas, the book segues into the story of an epic Venetian romance, where Symonds fell madly in love with a gondolier, who became the love of his life (who was also stuck in a marriage to a woman). When asked if she felt humiliated by the BBC interview, Wolf said: \u201cI don\u2019t feel humiliated but I\u2019m grateful for the correction. I feel great responsibility and humility about this history.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m not a gay man and I\u2019m not identified as part of the LGBTQ community, but this is an important man in history, what he did is important for all of us. The history of the freedom to love is everybody\u2019s fight. Its critical to reclaim it. I do feel a great sense of responsibility for getting it right.\u201d \u201cThis man\u2019s life is so extraordinary, he left us such a gift,\u201d she said. \u201cI find what he did so inspiring, as an activist and as someone who cares about love he didn\u2019t give up on love.\u201d One guest championed Wolf for her level-headedness. \u201cI can\u2019t take any credit for it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m responsible for getting it right.\u201d She added: \u201cWe\u2019re in a time of spin and fake news, endless lies from people who are not supposed to be lying to us, like press secretaries and politicians. Journalism is losing its ability to correct itself, as I saw with so many stories not correct about this. It\u2019s my job.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
