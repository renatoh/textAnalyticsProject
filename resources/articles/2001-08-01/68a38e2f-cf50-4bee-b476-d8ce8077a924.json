The report by the senior review salaries body, which is due to be published next month, will please the prime minister, Tony Blair, who is keen to attract more outsiders in Whitehall jobs, but will dismay public sector workers such as teachers and nurses who got an average rise this year of 3.7%. Set to be introduced from next April, the new pay bands will affect more than 3,000 mandarins with many who currently earn between \u00a342,000 and \u00a3127,000 likely to receive large rises in basic salary as well as substantial bonuses. The new pay structure will also see salaries more closely linked with performance and will also bring Whitehall pay into line with other senior local government positions such as NHS chief executives who can earn up to \u00a3150,000. The consultation paper recommends that the nine current senior pay grades - excluding permanent secretaries - should be reduced to three. The first band, under which about 2,300 civil servants fall, will range from \u00a349,000 to \u00a387,500. The second, affecting 600 staff, varies between \u00a367,500 and \u00a3129,000, and the third band will see about 100 officials receive from \u00a383,00 to \u00a3183,000. On top of this, \"substantial\" bonus payments of at least 10% will be offered to all civil servants within these bands. These bonuses could rise to as much as 20% in future years, although the report warns that bonuses will be slow at first due to fears of a public backlash. It says: \"We also need to recognise that the public perception on the payments of significant bonuses is an important consideration.\" The 38 permanent secretaries, who are at present the highest paid civil servants, will not be included in the new pay grades, but there is little doubt that their salaries would also increase. Sir Richard Wilson, the cabinet secretary, receives between \u00a3170,000 and \u00a3179,000. Since coming to power, Mr Blair has been disappointed by haemorrhaging of the civil service's brightest talents to better paid jobs in the City. However, with a decision due to made on the report's findings next month, Mr Blair could face an even more rocky ride at the Labour party conference, which opens on September 30. Senior trade union figures have already warned him that the honeymoon period between the government and the unions is over, with John Monks, general secretary of the TUC, warning him that there is \"anger and anxiety\" about plans for private sector involvement in the NHS.
