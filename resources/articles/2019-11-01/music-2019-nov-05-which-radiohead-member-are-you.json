Who are Radiohead, and why? For decades the personalities at play within the band have remained unfathomable. But with recent years featuring a run of solo projects from Jonny Greenwood (2019\u2019s Volume 1: Partita No 2 in D minor and Volume 2: Industry, Water); Ed O\u2019Brien (2019\u2019s single Santa Teresa); Phil Selway (2014\u2019s Weatherhouse); and Colin Greenwood (nothing, actually), we\u2019re beginning to colour in those formless blanks loitering behind Thom Yorke. Finally, we can answer the question that\u2019s been devouring every Guardian reader\u2019s soul since 1997. Which Radiohead solo member are you? 1.

They\u2019ll finally \u201cget\u201d you there. e) Um, invest it wisely in renewable energy? To be honest, no one knows the first thing about you. 2. Your weekly clowning class is cancelled due to all the sides you split last week, leaving you in an event-filled community centre with a couple of hours to kill.

The darts has finished early. What do you watch next? a) Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Black Swan. b) A 10-hour YouTube compilation of the most surreal bits from In the Night Garden, then just close your eyes and have a Netflix-and-chill of the mind. c) Inside Llewyn Davis.

You are invited on to Celebrity Storage Hunters as the team partner of Rebekah Vardy. What are you most hoping to vulture-pick from the last tawdry possessions of the bankrupt and destitute? a) An original 1928 ondes martenot you can shift on to Philip Glass for a tasty profit. b) The world\u2019s largest collection of magic-eye pictures. c) A Wilco songbook. d) A prototype Ultramagnetic Spotify Disruptor. e) It doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019ll be standing quietly at the back letting Giles and Mary from Gogglebox get on with it. 5.

Renowned for your witty and ribald public speaking, you are asked by close friend Dapper Laughs to be his best man.
