Only the host nation's second match and they're already playing knock-out football. After the draw between Greece and Spain earlier today, whoever loses tonight's match is out of Euro 2004. Portugal have made sweeping changes to the team that got humbled by Greece in the tournament's opening encounter: Miguel comes in at right-back, Ricardo Carvalho at centre-half, Nuno Valente at left-back and Deco starts up front. Fernando Couto and expensive new Chelsea acquisition Paulo Ferreira are among the high-profile casualties. As expected, Russia are fielding a team of big names (well, long ones), apart from Mr Mostovoi, who has been sent home for insubordination. Loskov, Bugayev and Kerzhakov come in to the team that lost against Spain. 1 min: And they're off. Portugal kick off playing for right to left. The home mob is baying for Russian blood and all 22 players must be planking themselves. 2 mins: A lot of tentative exchanges early doors. Both teams are testing the waters, gently probing ... which is minute-by-minute commentator-speak for \"I'm actually fielding a phone call from TV's James Richardson (clang!) and not really paying attention to what's going on\". Figo plays a clever ball through to Deco, who draws a foul out of Vadim Yevseyen deep in Russian territory. Nothing comes of it. 7 mins: Portugal 1 - 0 Russia Maniche bags the opener for Portugal with a fine strike. The cross came from Deco, who sent a low diagonal pass from right to left across the Russia box. Deco gathered it with his back to goal and despite the close attention of a Russian defender, managed to turn and shoot a low effort just inside the right upright. 9 mins: The Portugal fans are understandably thrilled with their team's goal, the source of which could originally be traced back to a poor clearance by Dmitry Sennikov from a Figo free-kick on the right flank. It's all Portugal at the moment. 13 mins: Portugal win a free-kick just inside the Russia half, which Costinha sends towards Figo, who loses the ball. Interestingly, there's a load of empty seats behind the Portugal goal ... very strange. For Russia, Kerzhakov attempts to put Dmitry Alenichev through on goal. He almost succeeds, but for the intervention of a Portuguese defender whose name I didn't get because, having finished my telephone conversation with TV's James Richardson (clang!) I was concentrating on trying to spell Alenichev properly. 15 mins: Portsmouth's Alexei Smertin gets booked for a harmless looking challenge on Deco just outside the Russia box. Nothing more than an unsuccessful Russian counter-attack comes from the free-kick. 19 mins: \"Barry, are you surprised by the Greek results?\" enquires Tony from Virginia. Not in the slightest, Tony. In terms of ability I'd put them on a par with England and Latvia. Despite this, I had money on them to beat Portugal in the opening match of the tournament and trousered a tidy sum as a result of it, because they were a massive price to win it. 22 mins: Figo, who's keeping fierce busy, dinks a lovely ball into Deco on the edge of the six-yard box. His attempt to chest it down is feeble and he makes it easy for Russia goalkeeper Ovchinnikov. 23 mins: Ricardo Carvalho gets booked for a foul on Alexander Kerzhakov. Except it wasn't a foul, it was a perfectly fair tackle. The referee, Mr Hauje, is looking a bit card-happy tonight. 26 mins: \"Deco did well to be on the receiving end of his own pass,\" writes Mark in Uruguay, and 45,000 other pedants. You don't miss a trick, do you? Grrr! 27 mins: Corner for Portugal, which is taken short. Deco dinks it into the box and the hirsute Ricardo Carvalho heads over the bar. 29 mins: Luis Figo does brilliantly to get a cross in from the right wing, but neither Deco nor Pauletta have the decency to head his inviting pass into the Russian goal. Bad form. 31 mins: Deco volleys a very scoreable Nuno Valente pass about 50 feet over the cross-bar. Is scoreable even a word? It is now. 34 mins: \"If I had to put my money on a top scorer overall, who would you go for? I'm thinking Zidane,\" writes Damian Marlee. Your living on the edge there Damian - he's already got two. Dmitry Loskov, the only man ever to win Russian Player Of The Year in consecutive years, fact fiends, blasts a low free-kick wide from about 40 yards. It was a good effort. 37 mins: \"Barry, you seem to be pretty good at laying down bets on winners. Who is your next pick?\" asks Rob in Budapest. Au contraire Rob, I only ever tell you about the winners. You won't hear me crowing about the six losers I backed at Royal Ascot this afternoon - no sir-ee! Through on goal, Simao goes down in the box under a challenge from Alexei Bugayev. Brilliant tackle. 40 mins: \"If the Americans can have 'winningest', we can have 'scoreable',\" writes James, an ex-pat in Washington. \"Need I mention that I think 'winningest' is possibly the most annoying word on the planet.\" Good effort, but I reckon there has to be a more annoying word than 'winningest' out there. I'm nominating 'source'. As in \"Barry, could you source me some paper-clips, please?\" or \"Whose turn is it to the source the tea?\" All that meaningless business-speak waffle really gets on my wick. Russia win a free-kick just in front of the Portugal D and it's blasted over the bar. 44 mins: Sergei Ovchinnikov the Russia goalkeeper gets sent off for handling the ball outside his area. Pauletta had capitalised on a dire back-pass and was bearing down on the Russia penalty area when Ovchinnikov hared off his line, out of his box, dived at his feet and appeared to handle the ball. 44+2 mins: Midfielder Yevgeny Aldonin makes way for the substitute goalkeeper Malafeev, who's winning his third cap. Portugal have a free-kick just to the right of the D, which Figo fires wide of the Russia wall and goal. The referee blows for half-time and Russia go in to their dressing room a goal and a man down, facing elimination. Half-time 45 mins: Ten-man Russia get the second half underway. \"I notice this is the only commentary that hasn't included vaguely amusing pictures of the players,\" writes Neil McIntosh. \"To remedy this I humbly submit this picture of Deco and his unfeasibly large eyebrows.\" No need for humility at all Neil. Top work. 46 mins: \"Did you know that Deco's first name is Arthur?\" writes Neil Hammond. \"They call him Art for short.\" That's not a bad gag considering Neil's e-mail signature reveals him to be a physicist in the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. Sttand-up comedy's loss is science's gain, it would appear. 49 mins: It's all Portugal in the early stages of the second half. Remember, if Russia lose, they're out. Nuno Valente goes on a surging run, cuts in from the left wing and unleashes a shot that stings the palms of Malafeev in the Russia goal. He turns the left-back's fine long-range effort around his post for a corner, from which nothing comes. 52 mins: There's a lot of people mailing in to say that slow-motion replays suggest that Ovchinnikov didn't touch the ball in that incident that saw him sent off. It raises an important footballing question: What the hell are you all doing pestering me if you're watching the game on television? Figo breaks down the left in a Portugal counter-attack, runs from box to box and wastes possession with a poor cross. 55 mins: Free-kick for Portugal about 35 yards straight in front of the Russia goal. Deco takes a long run-up and belts a daisy-cutter straight at Malafeev. Portugal substitute: the delightful Nuno Gomez replaces Pauletta. 57 mins: For Russia, Karyaka picks up the ball outside the area, makes room for a shot and this itme it's the Portugal goalkeeper who's got sore palms. He can only parry for a corner, from which nothing comes. 60 mins: Russia, who are beginning to impose themselves, win a free-kick in front of Portugal's goal, outside the box and to the right. Karyakov and Loskov stand over it, Loskov strikes ... wide. 62 mins: \"And if you are reporting on the game, why not mention the slow motion for those who are not watching it?\" writes Rob Gallo, not entirely unreasonably. The reason I didn't mention it, Rob, was because I was and remain coinvinced that he did touch the ball with his left hand and arm. Portugal substitution: Rui Costa for Simao. 63 mins: Portugal miss a glorious opportunity to kill the game off. After a great sequence of passes that carved open the Russia defence, Figo shot low and hard across the face of goal. Malafeev got a hand to it, knocked the ball on to the post and it rolled to the Deco, who shot over the bar from about six yards with the empty goal gaping. 66 mins: Only a fantastic tackle from Ricardo Carvalho prevents Alexander Kerzhakov from equalising for Russia. 70 mins: Russia substitution: Bystrov for Izmailov. Russia have 20 minutes to save their own skins. Lives depend on it. 72 mins: Some lovely passing enables Nuno Gomez to tee Deco. His rising howitzer brings another fine save out of Malafeev, the replacement goalkeeper. Now ladies and gentlemen, get out your Stepover Sweepstake cards - Cristiano Ronaldo is about to enter the kerfuffle. 76 mins: Figo tries a shot from 25 yards. But he doesn't really give it enough timber and Malafeev isn't troubled unduly. 77 Mins: Luis Figo hands his captain's armband to Rui Costa and makes way for Cristiano Ronaldo, who jogs on to the pitch looking remarkably stupid because of the big white plasters he has over his ear-lobes. Russia substitution: Bulykin replaces Karyaka. 80 mins: Cristiano Ronaldo works his magic to skin Yevseyen down the left wing and cross for Nuno Gomes. Russia clear, break and Bystrov goes down in a heap in the Portugal penalty area. He was chancing his arm - nobody fouled him and the ref waves play on. 82 mins: Sean Butler writes: \"The French TV commentators agree it was a disgraceful decision to send off the Russian goalie, he saved with his feet and the ball accidentally came into contact with his arm by which time any goalscoring opportunity had passed.\" Fair enough, Sean, I'll stand corrected. I'm man enough to do so because I usually so stunningly accurate and get things wrong so rarely. Alexei Bugayev denies Nuno Gomez a certain goal with a magnificent tackle in his own penalty area. 85 mins: Russia are doing their damnedest to score an equaliser here. From a free-kick outside the Portugal box, Bulykan comes close. Portugal clear, win a free-kick and Alenichev gets booked for throwing the ball at a Portugal player. 88 mins: Portugal 2 - 0 Russia Relief for Russia as Rui Costa clinches the match. The home side countered in a move that saw four of their players take on two hapless Russian defenders. Cristiano Ronaldo crossed from the left with the outside of his right boot and Rui Costa had the relatively simple task of volleying the ball past Malafeev from about five yards out. Game, set and match Portugal. 90 mins: Cristiano Ronaldo has been wreaking havoc down the left wing since he came on. After turning Yevseyen inside out again, he crosses for Nuno Gomes, who fails to control. Russia clear. 90 + 2 mins: The referee blows for full-time. Fans of Wales will be delighted to learn that Russia are the first team to be eliminated from Euro 2004. They still have to face Greece, who are all but through to the quarter-finals, but will only be playing for pride. Hosts Portugal live to fight another day and have a monumental must-win clash against their neighbours and most hated rivals Spain to look forward to. Last word tonight goes to Martin Parker in Barcelona: \"A friend once asked me how I rate Deco,\" he writes. \"I told him I\u00b4m not a Deco-rater.\" Russia (4-4-1-1): 1-Sergei Ovchinnikov; 16-Vadim Yevseyev, 4-Alexei Smertin (captain), 21-Alexei Bugayev, 17-Dmitry Sennikov; 5-Andrei Karyaka, 22-Yevgeny Aldonin, 15-Dmitry Alenichev, 20-Dmitry Loskov; 7-Marat Izmailov; 11-Alexander Kerzhakov."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
