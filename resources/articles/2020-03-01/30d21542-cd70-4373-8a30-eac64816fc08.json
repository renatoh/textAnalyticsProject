In an unexpected health crisis, we want the option of fast access to the top doctors, the right hospital care and everything we need to recover. Meet three people who are thankful they chose not-for-profit funds, which gave them the best cover when they really needed it. Coverage for the most unexpected discoveries Sergeant Topher McLoughlin had been serving in the police force for almost three decades when an event on duty changed the course of his life. \u201cI got bitten for the umpteenth time by a client and subsequently got a blood test,\u201d he says. What might have been a routine check took a devastating turn. \u201cI sat across from my GP who started to cry. He told me that I had stage-four lymphoma.\u201d In Mt Isa, where McLoughlin was based, the hospital didn\u2019t have the facilities to treat his cancer. He had no choice but to urgently fly 2,000km to Brisbane. \u201cI got into Brisbane and did all the checks, and then came back home and had to tell my wife the prognosis: horrendous,\u201d McLoughlin says. The change was difficult for the whole family, but McLoughlin\u2019s Police Health cover meant he could access the best treatment. \u201cAll of a sudden you\u2019ve gone from having to fight outlaw motorcycle gangs - which is my speciality - to how do you fight your own body? I struggled with that mentally. And then the reality set in that I would have to fly every three weeks. I could really see it was going to be quite expensive.\u201d In an unexpected health crisis, we want the option of fast access to the top doctors, the right hospital care and everything we need to recover.

For months, McLoughlin lived in Leukemia House, a facility in Brisbane that services patients flying in from western Queensland. \u201cWhen I first started, I would look at our bank account every day and think, how much is this costing? My wife kept saying, honey, you don\u2019t have to worry about it. You\u2019ve got full cover. Whatever is not available at Mt Isa, we can fly into Brisbane and get it there.\u201d That was three years ago. Of all the men McLoughlin befriended in Leukemia House, none are left. \u201cMost of those guys didn\u2019t have health cover,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were selling their houses, selling their assets. When they died, their family had nothing at all.\u201d Now, McLoughlin tells everyone living out west that they can\u2019t afford to be without private health insurance. \u201cThe further remote you are, the longer you have to wait.\u201d In regional and rural areas, there might only be one doctor, one hospital. He says having more choices has been worth every dollar he\u2019s paid. \u201cFor the people who think it\u2019s too expensive, it isn\u2019t. No one says no. It\u2019s that wonderful, safe feeling that someone\u2019s got you covered, and you can lower your guard and say, I really need help.\u201d Real support for the whole family Mel Tinkler\u2019s son, Max, plays VFL football. She says watching him is a battle with her nerves: \u201cI sit and watch football with my heart in my mouth.\u201d To protect him - and the rest of the family - she looked to her industry\u2019s restricted fund, Teachers Health. \u201cI\u2019d heard by word of mouth that it was a good fund, and when I read up and had a look at the literature, I liked that it was for teachers,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were a lot of benefits that were specific to teaching. I needed physio, and the physio rebate was a lot higher than the others. I liked that it was not-for-profit and the money was put back into offering a wider variety of services: it has things like optometry, dentistry and massage therapy. You don\u2019t realise, until you get onto the website and navigate around, how many things you can do.\u201d \u201cWe were able to get Australia\u2019s best doctor for knee surgery ... he was able to operate within a week\u201d - Max was back on the field in no time.

But the peace of mind for her children was even more important. \u201cI wanted to be covered so we could get the very best practitioners and in the quickest time possible, choosing a hospital that we could access quickly.\u201d When Max, 23, had a footy injury requiring two knee reconstructions, the family\u2019s private health insurance came into its own. \u201cWe were able to get Australia\u2019s best doctor for knee surgery,\u201d Mel says. \u201cHe was able to operate within a week.\u201d Max was back on the field in no time. Mel\u2019s kids may be adults, but they\u2019re still protected by her Teachers Health cover. \u201cYou\u2019re still a parent. It\u2019s always the kids; you put yourself second. With the kids, you want the very best for them.\u201d Knowing you\u2019re covered when there\u2019s no time to waste Dianne, 72, was having an MRI to investigate Parkinson\u2019s disease when doctors discovered she had a brain tumour. \u201cIt was 8cm long,\u201d she says. Life-saving surgery needed to happen right away. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to think about it. I was straight into hospital, transferred to Sydney at midnight. There was no time for discussions or questions. I met my neurosurgeon on the way into the operating theatre.\u201d A month after her surgery, Dianne wondered why she wasn\u2019t receiving any bills. \u201cI thought something had gone wrong in the system. I rang my surgeon\u2019s rooms and asked when they were going to start sending me bills, and they said, no, you won\u2019t be getting any bills.\u201d Dianne\u2019s not-for-profit health fund, HCF, covered every part of her care. \u201cThere was no gap at all.\u201d You never know when you might need to be covered. Make sure you\u2019re protected and have the right cover when you need it. Photograph: Morsa Images / Getty images. Now, Dianne runs an online support website for people who have the same type of brain tumours as she had. After using it to get more information about her own diagnosis, she got on board to help others. Part of Dianne\u2019s work is helping people make sure they have the right cover, something she says is really important to her. \u201cI\u2019m constantly typing, \u2018check with your fund\u2019. Ask them: what does this cover me for, what hospitals are you affiliated with, is there a waiting period to be covered?\u201d These same questions have saved Dianne years of stress and uncertainty. \u201cI could have been impacted by a bill of multiple thousands of dollars, and I wasn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a great relief.\u201d These are just three examples from the community of Members Health funds, of which there are 27 to choose from \u2013 each putting people\u2019s health before profits. Some are linked to key industries \u2013 doctors, nurses and midwives, military and navy personnel, teachers, police and emergency services, or financial services \u2013 while others are open to everyone. You never know when you might need to be covered. Make sure you\u2019re protected and have the right cover when you need it. Choosing the right health fund can literally save your life.
