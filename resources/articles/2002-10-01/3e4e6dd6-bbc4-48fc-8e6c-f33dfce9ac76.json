These are just two of the changes announced today by formula one officials in an attempt to spice up the sport after a year of Ferrari domination. The International Automobile Federation's (FIA) Formula One Commission considered several proposals, including a weight-handicapping system for dominant drivers, but stepped away from radical reforms. \"The ballast (issue) was thrown out,\" said FIA chief Max Mosley. \"People thought it was better to find a solution without putting people under pressure. \"We all felt we would like to see Schumacher or whoever trying to win the championship as best he could without extra difficulty. We hope the new qualifying system will shake it up.\" The axing of the Belgian Grand Prix in a row over tobacco advertising was confirmed, but the race might be re-introduced in 2004. There will be two qualifying sessions compared to the current one, with one qualifying lap for each car and cars to run one at a time. Team orders have triggered controversy for many seasons. World champion Michael Schumacher benefitted this year when Ferrari team-mate Rubens Barrichello let him past to win the Austrian race in May. \"It'll be surprising if we don't see close racing next season but close racing depends on the leading teams all doing a good job, not just one, and they are determined to do that,\" said FIA president Max Mosley. \"Next season is going to be interesting,\" said Ferrari team boss Jean Todt. Falling television audiences after a season of Ferrari domination - they won 15 of 17 races, Michael Schumacher won the world championship and his team-mate Rubens Barrichello was runner-up - caused much soul-searching within the sport. \"It's the best compromise that could be achieved because we didn't change formula one for added weight,\" said the former world champion Niki Lauda, now Jaguar's team boss. \"The team orders are gone which is the most important thing.\" Meanwhile, the qualifying system will undergo surgery too. At present there is one hour of qualifying on a Saturday at grand prix. Fans complain that drivers do not drive flat out on the Friday and many cars stay in the pits for much of the Saturday qualifying with little excitement on the track. Next season there will be qualifying on Friday and Saturday, with the fastest driver on Friday racing last on Saturday. Formula one has agreed to phase out all sponsorship by tobacco companies in 2006 in line with a global embargo favoured by the World Health Organisation. Belgium has not followed the example of several European countries which have offered a special dispensation from domestic legislation limiting tobacco advertising to motor racing until 2006. \"Other countries adapted and Belgium did not,\" Lauda said. \"Some countries allow tobacco and this is the problem (for Belgium). The decision was that we need tobacco because in the world economy today we need to keep every sponsor and not frighten them away. \"It's very important to have advertising on cars - this is the principle of formula one, you need any sponsor.\" Five formula one teams, including world champions Ferrari, have tobacco sponsorship. Spa has hosted 36 Belgian grand prix. Mosley said the race could be re-introduced in 2004 if Belgium introduced an exemption from legislation. In a last-gasp rescue attempt, two Belgian senators said they planned to introduce a bill to the upper house of parliament this week aimed at postponing the date when the country's anti-tobacco law comes into effect. Their original bid to protect Belgium's grand prix failed in July when Green and Christian Democrat senators rejected a bill that would have lifted the ban on cigarette advertising for Spa's annual race. \"The aim (of the bill) is simply to postpone the application of the law until September 30, 2003,\" French-speaking Liberal Senator Philippe Monfils said in a statement, citing the economic benefits of the race for the Spa region. \"If this bill was approved, next year's grand prix would be saved, giving us the time to examine a definitive solution,\" Monfils said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
