Football as mass entertainment has ceased and yet, for one of the world\u2019s leading professional freestylers, it is debatable whether the popularity and profile of her chosen sport has ever felt so high. The platform has enabled Cooke to provide education as well as offer escapism. \u201cFreestyle football is a massively growing sport and right now it feels like every professional footballer is becoming a freestyler too,\u201d says Cooke, the 2017 world champion, the UK\u2019s first woman professional freestyler, and now a BBC presenter. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen Paul Pogba doing around the worlds at home and many others too. It\u2019s putting the sport in a positive light. It helped me physically and mentally and now I\u2019m addicted to it. It changed my life and if it can help others at this time then that is a beautiful thing.\u201d Cooke\u2019s way of helping is #TutorialsForIsolation, a \u201crandom idea\u201d that has gained a vast following on social media over the past few weeks. Every day the 20-year-old from Leyland, Lancashire, posts footage of herself performing a freestyle trick on Instagram, Twitter and TikTok \u2013 all @LivCookeFS \u2013 with instructions on how to follow suit at home. It is an opportunity to learn from a four-times world record holder \u2013 Cooke\u2019s records are for sole juggles (217 in 60 seconds), chin juggles (208 in 60 seconds), leg rolls (27 in 30 seconds) and sole passes (18 in 30 seconds) \u2013 but also, and perhaps more importantly at this time, to remain active and learn within the confines of home. \u201cI posted a video of me doing a trick in my kitchen and people were asking me how to do it,\u201d Cooke explains. \u201cSo I thought this would be the perfect time to do it. People can go on a downward spiral when they\u2019re stuck at home but this keeps you happy and fit. \u201cThe idea is to build up from beginners\u2019 tricks to more difficult tricks. The hardest part has been thinking of a trick and then making sure it can be done indoors, otherwise people might end up breaking everything. \u201cAt first we scripted the tricks but that wasn\u2019t working, it just wasn\u2019t me, but when we started doing them off-the-cuff it allowed me to think in the moment and that was much better. We\u2019re doing one trick a day during isolation and if we have to keep going then I\u2019ll just have to be creative; I am a professional freestyler after all.\u201d Cooke had established a huge social media following before the lockdown \u2013 4.1m followers and counting on TikTok, for example \u2013 with a role on MOTDx following on from her professional successes and commercial appearances. The reaction, therefore, has been less surprising than the public\u2019s ability to copy the tricks. \u201cWhat has surprised me is how many people have accomplished the tricks and how quickly they\u2019ve picked it up,\u201d Cooke says. \u201cIt just shows how important social media is. I was aware of its importance before the isolation. I had young girls coming up to me to say I had inspired them. \u201cI\u2019m a girl from a small town in Lancashire and if I can do it, so can they. But during this isolation I\u2019ve noticed the power of social media to do something good. \u201cIf I have the power to make a difference then now is the time to show it. I think the benefits vary. Some people may have nothing to do and having a trick to try gives them a focus for an hour or two and stops them going into a downward spiral. \u201cOthers who are working from home may be sat in a chair all day so it gives them a break, a bit of exercise and refreshes them. It\u2019s important to learn new skills constantly.\u201d Cooke\u2019s productivity during the lockdown does not end with teaching the reverse crossover, the side-of-the-head stall and \u2018the Slap\u2019 to a mass audience. She has also signed up for the Royal Voluntary Service since the crisis began although professional work \u2013 such as her role as a global ambassador for Euro 2020 \u2013 has naturally been affected, along with preparations to play in this summer\u2019s Soccer Aid fundraiser at Old Trafford. \u201cI was really looking forward to Soccer Aid, which was going to be my first proper match in six years,\u201d says Cooke, who played for Preston\u2019s junior sides and Blackburn\u2019s centre of excellence before a recurring back injury diverted her career towards freestyle. \u201cIt\u2019s a real shame that has been postponed as it raises so much money for Unicef but nothing is more important than peoples\u2019 health so I\u2019m glad it has been postponed. I\u2019m not seeing that as a negative. \u201cNHS staff are working crazy hours. My sister-in-law Emma is working non-stop in the NHS. She\u2019s putting her life on the line so it\u2019s only right that we postpone these events and don\u2019t place any more strain on the NHS. The only problem for me is that my family is in Leyland and I\u2019m in Manchester. I really miss them but my situation doesn\u2019t compare at all \u2013 I can still work from home and do my videos.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
