Brawn, along with Williams and Toyota, have been challenged by rival teams who did not appear to be so crafty when reading the 2009 technical regulations and failed to spot a design loophole exploited by, it is no coincidence, the three teams that have set the early pace. Since the defendants have already received tacit approval of the controversial but clever diffusers at the rear of their cars, it would be a surprise if the FIA went against their own officials. If they did, it would be another disaster heaped upon a sport in danger of suffocating from a surfeit of drama and nonsense that has little to do with the actual racing. But, while Jenson Button's wins in Australia and Malaysia are likely to stand, there is every chance that the FIA World Motor Sport Council may emerge from a subsequent meeting on 29 April with smoke curling from both barrels after splattering McLaren's reputation around the governing body's grand surroundings in Place de la Concorde. It is irrelevant now that McLaren's initial indiscretion had its beginnings in the sort of quiet subterfuge likely to be enacted this weekend in any stewards' office from Brands Hatch to the Buckmore Park go-kart track. The self-righteous bellowing of the FIA will drown out questions about their stewards in Australia speaking to participants with vested interests rather than trackside officials who could have presented unbiased and accurate accounts of what had gone on, thus avoiding the embarrassment of penalising Jarno Trulli for deliberately overtaking Lewis Hamilton when the Toyota driver had been given no alternative. But, once that point had been reached, Hamilton and his race director, Dave Ryan, appear to have dug a massive hole with unnecessary denials, the incident gathering a momentum out of proportion with the original crime. Ryan has since been dismissed after 34 years of unwavering dedication to the company and the sport, a curious decision by a team that previously claimed there was no blame culture within its perfect walls. It could be that Ryan, either voluntarily or through persuasion, has broken all ties with McLaren, thus making him a private individual beyond the demands of the FIA to appear before them. Either way, the FIA's charge sheet focuses entirely on the team; a sign that Hamilton will escape censure, particularly after the hand-wringing displayed at an FIA-approved press conference in Malaysia. While it is perhaps understandable that Hamilton should blindly follow team instructions when his mind was still in a whirl immediately after the race, it is less easy to comprehend how an apparently virtuous and mature 24-year-old should allow himself to be coerced four days later and then, along with the team, hang a decent man out to dry. McLaren may have a lot of explaining to do to the court, but justification of their behaviour is also owed to the world at large. Were the charges laid against them not so serious, McLaren might be forgiven for happily accepting that the drama away from the track has diverted attention from their lack of success on it. The FIA can be congratulated on formulating new rules that have shaken up the established order to such an extent that Ferrari and McLaren, the teams to beat during the past two years, are languishing near the bottom of the table. Both are suffering from the absence of the contentious diffuser and a nod of approval on Tuesday will set them back even further as they redesign the rear of the cars, a job McLaren, Ferrari and the five remaining teams will have already started as a precaution. It will allow Brawn and the rest to continue to break free next weekend in China and the week after in Bahrain before the teams return to base after their four-race tour outside Europe. McLaren and Ferrari can justify their shortfall in performance thanks to the distraction created by fighting for the championship until the last race of the 2008 season. It is true that Brawn (then Honda) had the luxury of focusing entirely on the future since their 2008 car was a write-off from the start. But Toyota and Red Bull, while not in the forefront, managed to put themselves in a position where their first grand prix win may be forthcoming within the next few months. The long straights of Sepang encouraged the use of Kers in last Sunday's race and a similar track layout at Shanghai next weekend will allow teams such as Renault and McLaren to maximise the energy retention system's power boost to induce overtaking. There were spectacular wheel-to-wheel battles in Malaysia before rain stopped play. This regional foible was to be expected at that hour, which questions the decision by Bernie Ecclestone to stage the race late in the day in order to match social viewing times in Europe. Only Ecclestone can judge whether it was worth having a wider audience switch on, only to watch nothing happening for 50 minutes before the inevitable decision not to restart was finally reached: another instance of the sport's administrators detracting unnecessarily from what could be a season of excellent motor racing?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
