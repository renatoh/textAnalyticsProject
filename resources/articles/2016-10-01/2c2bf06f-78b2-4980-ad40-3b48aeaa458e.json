It is based on the true story of Phiona Mutesi, the smart, courageous kid from the grindingly poor shantytown of Katwe, in the Ugandan capital Kampala, who became a national chess champion. And all this in the face of poverty and personal heartbreak: her dad died of HIV/Aids, though the film does not specify the cause. The treatment feels so familiar, with a touch of sugar in the mix, that you could almost overlook how remarkable her story actually is. Mutesi is well played by Madina Nalwanga: calm, watchful, impassive. She could be portraying a world-class poker player. Her coach Robert Katende is played by David Oyelowo and her fiercely protective mother, Nakku Harriet, by Lupita Nyong\u2019o. Both of them do solid work, although the roles do not exactly stretch them, compared to the great performances they have given in the past. It\u2019s a heartfelt movie, which makes up in warmth what it lacks in narrative originality."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
