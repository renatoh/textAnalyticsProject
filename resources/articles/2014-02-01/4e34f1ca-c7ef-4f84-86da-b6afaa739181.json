Then their luggage got lost en route. Finally, 24 years on from the fairytale story retold by Disney as Cool Runnings, they had to wage a war against being patronised. But for the veteran Winston Watts and his younger two-man bobsleigh partner Marvin Dixon, the journey from Kingston to the Sanki sliding centre to travel 1500m on ice at 80mph in their Jamaica 1 sled was well worth it. Watts, now 46, was a member of what he has called \"Cool Runnings, the second generation\" when he competed in 1994, 1998 and 2002. Returning for the fifth instalment in the franchise , it has plainly lost none of its appeal. Never mind the sleek lines and fast times of the American, Swiss and German outfits, there was only one sled that the crowd packed into the tiny grandstand at the finish wanted to see besides that of their own Russian team. At the finish line where the \"Yarny Army\" had fluttered Union Jacks on Friday, cheering fans waved Jamaican flags bearing the image of Bob Marley. After arriving in Sochi and revealing that their luggage and blades had gone missing somewhere en route, Watts had wanted to be serious for a moment. \"We are as serious as athletes as the Swiss, Germans and Canadians. We are not a bunch of jokers,\" he said before competing. \"We came here as an underdog. We are hungry men, and hungry men are angry.\" The journey to make it back to the Games had been a long one. Having qualified, they then launched an online fundraising campaign to raise the money to get to Russia. So popular was their plea, which garnered worldwide media attention, that their own Olympic committee was shamed into stumping up some cash and sponsors also came to the table. Having raised $80,000 (\u00a347,800), Watts and Dixon had to call a halt, fearing they would be labelled greedy if the money kept rolling in. When Jamaica 1 set off for its second run, Watts was having issues with his visor and the sled almost turned over on a corner towards the mid-section of the course before stabilising. They finished 4.41 seconds behind the Russian leaders, ahead of what will be their third and final run on Monday. Only the top 20 will proceed to the fourth and final heat. The GB pilot Lamin Deen, who finished 23rd with his brakeman John Baines, had earlier enjoyed lunch with the Jamaicans and engaged in a side bet over start times \u2013 which the Brits narrowly won. \"It's fantastic, they're good lads,\" said Deen. The Jamaican pair didn't seem very angry afterwards, although they weren't entirely satisfied with their performance. Despite finishing dead last, they were far from disgraced and sat just 0.36 seconds behind the Serbian sled going into the third heat. More than two decades on and despite being odds on to finish 30th out of 30 sleds, the gregarious and engaging Watts and his younger brakeman \u2013 and their black, yellow and gold chariot \u2013 were again among the biggest winners from these Olympics. Other athletes from non-traditional winter sports nations have complained that the Jamaicans appear to have a monopoly on media interest, but it is hard to begrudge them that. The originals are still the best. \"People watch Cool Runnings and think it's a joke but we are not a bunch of jokers. We wanted to show the world we are still alive,\" said Watts at the finish. \"Win or lose I'm still here and we are happy. The crowd are rooting for us, they know we are just a small little island.\" The Jamaican pilot said he had broken his visor in the excitement. \"The adrenaline was flowing and I pulled it down and it just broke. I thought 'I'm still going, I'm not going to stop. I'll show the world I still have heart.'\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
