Fronted by American actress Lindsay Lohan, the Visa Swap campaign, now in its second year, allows people to exchange their unwanted clothes for other people's cast-offs. Participants dropped off unwanted items at collection points over the last six weeks, receiving points on a swipe card. The more exclusive the outfit, the more points they received, which they could spend yesterday on other donated items."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
