Before I started I was nervous about meeting people and fitting in, but it's been fine. I arrived a bit later than everyone else so it seemed like they knew each other already, but a note was pushed under my door saying there was a hall meeting where we had some ice-breaking activities, telling each other interesting facts about ourselves. After that, everyone went around knocking on each other's doors and saying hello. We had a little party that night! There are 11 girls on my floor and 12 blokes on the floor below. I've been out almost every night. I stayed in last Monday and Tuesday, so I was being good. There hasn't been too much work yet. A few lectures and seminars, but they're mainly telling us what we're going to be doing over the year. We've been given big booklists and I've bought lots of the books. It looks really interesting, but different from what I'm used to, because we're expected to go away and get on by ourselves. We've got an essay coming up, so we're doing preparation for that. I'm not sure what that's about! I'm reckon it will be OK, though. My timetable isn't too packed. It's only Mondays that are a bit mental, and I've got Tuesdays off. They keep going on about all the people we can see if we're having trouble. There's lots of support if you're having problems. I've spent quite a bit of money. It's hard my loan went into my bank account and suddenly there was all this money there. I was like, 'Don't spend it!', but it is tempting. I was thinking about keeping my job at home it's only in Manchester, which isn't far but I've said that I'll call them if I want to work. I don't think I will, though. It would mean going back at weekends. I didn't mind that idea so much before I started at uni, but now I think it would mean missing out on so much. At the moment, I don't think I'll get a job here, not unless I'm desperate. I can live on cheap beans and I can work in the holidays. I don't feel homesick and haven't talked to my mum that much. Every time I phone she's like, 'Oh, it's not a good time right now, can you call back?' And then when she calls me, it's always the wrong time. University doesn't seem scary any more. I like it here. The campus is quite small; you see familiar faces. I've got my own room and I'm slowly making it nice I've put some posters up, at least. Everyone's really comfortable with each other now. You live at such close quarters that you just have to get on. We all just leave our doors open all the time and chat with each other. I feel very happy and at home. Meanwhile ... Anna Berrill is studying music at Oxford Brookes University I've been ill. I had tracheitis and laryngitis, which isn't great. I had to go to hospital for a chest scan, but they let me go the same evening. My mum took me home for the weekend, but then I came back to college. Matthew Holehouse is studying modern history at The Queen's College, Oxford I'm having huge amounts of fun getting involved with the student newspaper, the Oxford Student, and training to be a cox. Lots of work, though. After the first hour, it's fine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
