Played in surtitled French by Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise \u2013 making their first visit to Britain in almost 20 years \u2013 the result is as thrilling as Van Hove\u2019s National Theatre production of Network. The story traces the rise of the Third Reich through the eyes of a doomed steelmaking dynasty, the von Essenbecks. But Van Hove\u2019s version strikes me as sharper and clearer than Visconti\u2019s in establishing the links between familial decay and Nazi murderousness. While cinematic, it also uses all the properties of theatre. Each death in the dynasty is punctuated by a blast on an industrial whistle and a solemn burial of the body in a line of onstage coffins. A camera even gives us an unnerving corpse-eye-view of entombment. The house lights are then turned up and a camera is trained on the audience as if to suggest the hideous past is capable of re-enactment in the present. The production is filled with startling set pieces. The most chilling shows Martin, heir to the von Essenbeck complex and superbly played by Christophe Montenez, engaging in dangerous games with a young girl. The magnetic Elsa Lepoivre as Martin\u2019s mother stalks the family home like Lady Macbeth and deploys her sexuality as a weapon both with her lover, played with insatiate power-hunger by Guillaume Gallienne, and the family\u2019s Nazi cousin, invested by \u00c9ric G\u00e9nov\u00e8se with a cold-eyed calculation. In a famous echo of history we also see Denis Podalyd\u00e8s as Konstantin, the supplanted inheritor of the factories, joining the Brownshirts in a beer-swilling bacchanal only to be mown down by Hitler\u2019s SS. One particular moment, in which the camera tracks Martin\u2019s mother through the labyrinthine Barbican, provokes laughter. Otherwise, this is a riveting spectacle acted by a great ensemble that \u2013 aided by Jan Versweyveld\u2019s design, Tal Yarden\u2019s video and Eric Sleichim\u2019s sound \u2013 shows a family inexorably destroyed by its complicity with a world-shaking tyranny. \u2022 At the Barbican, London, until 25 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
