It loomed behind Gwenifer Raymond\u2019s house when she grew up, as the guitarist moved from explorations of punk towards folk, traditional music, the blues and beyond. Raymond\u2019s 2018 debut, You Never Were Much of a Dancer, set alight the ghost of American primitive pioneer John Fahey (one track was a requiem for him, echoing his own for Mississippi John Hurt). Her fingers tangled around her guitar strings in thrilling, intricate patterns. This time, on an album richly influenced by her birth country, she tries to invent a new style: Welsh primitive, she calls it, infused with folk horror, conjuring up coal trains steaming along the foot of her garden and tall, eerie trees, black against the grey sky. Those expecting Welsh folk styles will be disappointed. Strange Lights\u2019 closest cousin from Cymru is probably Rhodri Davies\u2019 Telyn Rawn album from earlier this year, where his medieval harp\u2019s horsehair strings seemed to seethe and bleed. Raymond\u2019s references are more about mood, beginning with Incantation\u2019s slow, single drum and shaken bells, then a simple, stark guitar line that weaves a menacing spell. Hell for Certain ups the pace, becoming thick, dense and tangled like a Davy Graham raga. Worn Out Blues bends out its sad melody with sighs of both melancholia and terror. Gwaed am Gwaed (Blood for Blood) most effectively conjures up an ominous landscape, however, driven by a minor-key folk ballad figure that writhes around and over itself, like a mythical creature slithering out of the shadows. Raymond\u2019s similarly fearsome precision often feels both portentous and perfect. Released on 13 November. Also out this month Sam Amidon\u2019s Sam Amidon (Nonesuch) radically reworks traditional songs to which he\u2019s long been drawn, although Leo Abrahams\u2019 light-headed production often lessens their potency. Some work beautifully though, such as Spanish Merchant\u2019s Daughter, a flute soothing itself around Amidon\u2019s earnest vocals. These Feral Lands: Volume 1 by Laura Cannell and Friends (Brawl) is an excellent, exploratory project, weaving personal folklore around Cannell\u2019s shuddering violin improvisations (watch out for Stewart Lee\u2019s Wrekin giant). Our lengthening nights also suit the heavy, warm drones of \u00c5non Egeland and Mikael Marin\u2019s Farvel, Farvel (Taragot Sounds), an album of Norwegian traditional instrumentals and psalms played on the Hardanger fiddle and five-string viola."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
