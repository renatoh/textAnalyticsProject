Last week in London Timothy Spall impressed critics as Albert Pierrepoint, Britain's best-known public executioner. In the US, movie-goers saw the first trails for United 93, a dramatic reconstruction of what might have happened inside the hijacked plane intended for the White House on September 11 2001. A relative of one of the passengers who died as the plane plummeted into a Pennsylvania wood told the Today programme he found the film commendably moving and well-made. Both films owe their existence to a unique tradition of fact-based television drama in this country. Feature films that began life as movies commissioned for TV are now so common their genesis hardly merits special comment. Channel 4 pioneered the idea of the dual TV-theatrical release from its beginnings in the 1980s with the innovative Film Four strand. The BBC followed suit some ten years later with Screens One and Two; both broadcasters helped bring to life some of the best British cinema of the last 20 years. Pierrepoint and United 93 have a different and no less respectable pedigree. They are from the drama-documentary tradition pioneered by Granada in the 1970s - later to be become a distinctive feature of ITV's output in the 1990s and still alive and kicking, despite everything, if not always on ITV. United 93 is written and directed by Paul Greengrass, known in Hollywood as the director of the hit thriller The Bourne Identity but better known here as the maker of a succession of award-winning drama documentaries, the most recent of which were C4's Omagh, Granada's Bloody Sunday and The Murder of Stephen Lawrence. The hallmark of Greengrass's work for television is an extraordinary sense of actuality captured with a hand-held filming technique and an observational documentary style underpinned by rigorously researched journalism. These are the same qualities he brings to the Hollywood-backed 9/11 project. Until a few years ago Greengrass was a Granada programme maker who learnt his craft as a World in Action producer. It was Granada's venerable current affairs series that gave birth to this controversial hybrid genre in a 1970 edition about a Russian dissident, The Man Who Wouldn't Keep Quiet. Leslie Woodhead, who made the film and went on to make Invasion and Three Days in Szczecin, later described their approach as \"very careful and rather puritanical\". As another World in Action staffer put it: \"For us, the dramadoc is an exercise in journalism, not dramatic art.\" In secure and expansive times such asceticism was possible, even encouraged, at Granada. World in Action used the genre to get to places traditional television journalism couldn't reach; films like Who Bombed Birmingham had an emotional punch and practical impact no current affairs programme could ever have achieved. Meanwhile in another part of the ITV forest, factual producer Jeff Pope was developing dramatisations of the Brinks Mat robbery and other striking modern crime stories for LWT. A string of successful peaktime factual dramas followed from both companies: Danielle Cable: Eyewitness, This is Personal, and Hillsborough among them. The genre matured into something rather less austere than its antecedents: composite characters were created to help the narrative along and some scenes imagined to fill in the gaps. But good writing, inspired casting and, above all, respect for the facts remained its hallmark. The two ITV traditions have long since come together. Greengrass may be lost to Hollywood (though creative Brits have a habit of coming back), but Pope is still on the staff of ITV Productions, developing and writing factual dramas. Already planned are the stories of the relationship between Myra Hindley and Ian Brady, and the Outback murder of Peter Falconio. These films will always be controversial because they can't help but present one version of \"the facts\" where others may have different interpretations, and those directly involved will have a very personal take on the events being portrayed. But this is still a genuinely revelatory way of telling difficult, important and intriguing stories from our recent past. And it's a legacy from commercial television's fat years that we can be proud of. In leaner and more competitive times the spirit of dramadoc is willing but the flesh is sometimes weak. ITV, under pressure to maximise ratings and doubtful that such a dark story could pull them in, had a wobble after commissioning Pierrepoint and it went on the back-burner. Fortunately, those who were passionate about the project prevailed. A small gem of a film gets to the screen and a valuable tradition, made in Britain, continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
