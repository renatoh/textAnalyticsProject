Big debts, bigger classes. Fighting for books, working nights and weekends to make ends meet. I am having one of those gloomy winter crises of confidence where I can't quite remember what this business is about. Recent reports suggest that a significant number of potential students also have their doubts about the value of higher education. Undergraduate numbers for next September - the first year for top-up fees to kick in - are lower than expected in a number of institutions. Higher education just doesn't seem such a good investment any more; you rack up all that debt, and there is no guarantee that you will get a suitable (shiny, graduate, exciting) job at the end of it. At the same time, admissions tutors complain that undergraduates lack basic educational skills. What is the point of extending higher education to those who cannot read, write and count with confidence? In a recent Guardian article Richard Sennett argues that \"usefulness is the political project of our times\" - meaning that we need to find ways of giving meaningful activity to people who live in economies where productivity no longer requires a large labour force. His point is that too many of the population are under-employed. What needs to be done for economic growth can be done without a large proportion of the workforce, with the result that too many people feel useless. If this is the case, it brings new challenges for higher education. In recent years, those wishing to champion universities have relied on that over used concept, the knowledge economy. Globalisation, apparently, demands that successful economies develop highly skilled workforces and strong research bases. If those attending university do not attain this magical highly skilled status - or attain skills that never quite get to be used in the workplace - higher education loses its most convincing selling point. Who wants to fund a complex and resource-heavy system of self-discovery and inner exploration? If you want therapy, pay for it yourself. Universities may resent being cast as providers of \"skills\", as opposed to purveyors of learning and scholarship, but this claim that higher education offers the route to affluence for all has been an important part of the public lobbying for the sector. Don't get me wrong - I hope that universities will make us all rich as much as the next person. It is just that I am not sure that a degree should be understood primarily as a qualification for work. A doubt that leaves me scrabbling about for some other justification for what we do. With others, I have been mulling over this whole debate about Britishness - who do we want to be? Who the hell do you think you are? - and I have been thinking a lot about what binds us together and where higher education fits into this. Maybe this freedom, tolerance, flag-waving thing is higher education's job? Of course, the question of who we want to be need not be answered with some reworking of Britishness. There is a need for us to have a shared space of social understanding and interaction - not necessarily where we agree, but where the terms of disagreement can be made manageable. There is no need at all for this space to be tied to ideas of national identity and culture. Benedict Anderson's famous account of the modern nation as an imagined community argues that a set of connections is created through the imaginary links of a shared public space - exemplified by a national press. You don't need to know the other people in the nation, or be like them, or share their stock or heritage - what you need is to imagine yourself to be engaged in a shared space of debate and understanding. Whatever else is happening, we seem to be lacking such a shared space at the moment. From provocative cartoons to threatening protests, antisocial behaviour and happy slapping to organised bigotry and hate crimes, we don't seem to have much space to negotiate shared values or mediate disagreements. If we are ever to get any better at this, the answer is unlikely to come from telling people who to be and what to think - that has never worked as a method of inculcating values, except when tied to exceptional fear. A public institution dedicated to self-exploration, somewhere to try out ideas and ways of being, and test them on others who are going through similar explorations, seems more likely to lead to a renewal of shared values than any number of public speeches. In the past, this club of overlapping experiences was limited to a highly privileged minority. These are those insufferable people who really did all go to college together and continue to scratch each other's backs across all of the most influential professions. They get these jobs not because of the training for work that their degrees offered, but because they became imbued with that much more mysterious entity, cultural capital. Whatever the differences and disagreements among such people, they have a basis for shared understanding and, perhaps, even something like shared values. The experience of getting a degree - that mixture of freedom and study and new ideas and people, all of it wrapped in unpredictable social interactions in a relatively safe space - is not a bad model for practicing shared citizenship. It may or may not equip you to become a wealth-creator, but it does give participants a chance to think about who they are, how they relate to others and what kind of society they would like to live in. None of this will uncover the elusive essence of Britishness, but in the absence of other shared and diverse public spaces, higher education may be one of the best shots at peaceful co-existence that we have."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
