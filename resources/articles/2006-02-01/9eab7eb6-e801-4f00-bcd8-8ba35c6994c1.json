But occasionally a game arrives that renews your faith in the potential of this fledgling artform. Ico, with its powerful emotional engagement, was one of these. And so is Shadow of the Colossus, the latest effort from Ico's creators. Published by Sony, the game sounds simplistic - using your sword, horse and wits you must defeat 16 huge beasts one by one. But by the time you have clambered on to your first adversary - all of whom dwarf your character - you'll be too busy clinging on to worry. These colossi, with their physical presence, are the stars, but the setting - stark lighting and windswept landscapes - is equally integral. It may lack Ico's intensity, but Shadow of the Colossus is a masterpiece. Greg Howson We Love Katamari PlayStation 2, \u00a339.99 4/5 \"Bonkers\" is not a word I'd often use, but it sums up this one. Katamari Damacy has been a cult hit for a while and the sequel broadens that appeal without quite capturing the magic of the original. The idea is to roll a sticky ball around a series of dayglo 3D levels, picking up anything in your path. Your main goal is to reach a certain circumference before time runs out, but special objectives are handed out for each level, including ball-rolling rivals to defeat. With its retro music, bad translations and psychedelic humour, there's too much going on to summarise. If it's originality you're after, Katamari is like nothing else out there. Mike Anderiesz Dead or Alive 4 Xbox 360, \u00a339.99 3/5 As eye-candy, this hi-tech beat-'em-up is hard to beat - its pin-sharp graphics, with ultra-detailed backgrounds and startlingly synthetic, anime-style characters, are arresting. But they merely add gloss to a workaday beat-'em-up, which at least eschews complex special moves in favour of punching, kicking, blocking and throwing, which must be timed to the microsecond. The throws are particularly tricky, but satisfying, and the different fighting styles add a modicum of variety. Tecmo's trademark touches, multitiered levels, detailed cut-scenes and gratuitous animals are present and correct, adding to the richness of the visual feast and injecting some humour. It should boost the Xbox 360's dismal sales in Japan, but only true beat-'em-up aficionados will be able to generate much enthusiasm.
