This led to The Day Christ Died, Day of Infamy (Pearl Harbor), The Longest Day (D-Day) and a book-length parody called The Day Nothing Happened. This often rather dubious celebration of synchronicity continues with Bobby, written and directed by Emilio Estevez and featuring himself as one of 22 fictional characters, all played by well-known actors, who happen to be in the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, the day Bobby Kennedy was assassinated there in June 1968. Ranging from the liberal manager (William H Macy), who's having an affair with a telephonist (Heather Graham), to the philosophical head chef (Laurence Fishburne), who's educating a young Hispanic waiter (Freddy Rodriguez), they all reflect something about that summer of hope and despair when Bobby seemed on his way to the Presidency and ending the Vietnam War. This dim movie invites suicidal comparison with Altman's ensemble pieces, and compares badly with Grand Hotel, to which Anthony Hopkins, as a former chief doorman who can't drag himself away from the Ambassador, refers. It's sentimentally nostalgic, and curiously unrevealing. It reminded me, however, of where I was that fateful day. I was at the Palladium in London to review the boxing musical Golden Boy, starring Sammy Davis Jr, a close friend of the Kennedy family. At the interval, still dressed in his boxer's gear, Davis came on stage to say that his spirit was in the States with the dying Bobby Kennedy and that he no longer had the heart to continue. He urged us to consider the play's message of freedom and racial equality, and to pray after our own individual fashions for Bobby when we got home."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
