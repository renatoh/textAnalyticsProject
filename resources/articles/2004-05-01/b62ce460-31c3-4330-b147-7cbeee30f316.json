Coe won four Olympic medals and smashed 12 world records but he has never faced an opponent as formidable as Paris. The report of the IOC assessment committee ranks the French capital's bid so vastly superior to London's that Coe appears to have been drafted in as the new chairman and president because even Barbara Cassani acknowledged that she could not close the gap. Coe, now 47, compares the situation with 1983 when he was laid low with a viral ailment which induced a state of incessant tiredness. He pulled out of the world championships but the following year in Los Angeles defied the odds to win his second consecutive Olympic 1500m title ahead of his team-mate Steve Cram. Coe sees his latest challenge in similar terms. \"It's pace, judgment and making sure no stone is unturned,\" he said. \"Mental confidence is about proper underpinning. It's very important in any event to understand your competition.\" That LA triumph cemented Coe's position in the Olympic pantheon and made him a favourite of Juan Antonio Samaranch, then IOC president. \"He thinks the sun shines out of Seb's backside,\" a senior Olympic official once said. Samaranch was such a fan of Coe that in 1988, when he was controversially left out of Britain's Olympic team, the Spaniard tried to change the rules - unsuccessfully - so he could compete in Seoul. Coe has regularly accompanied Samaranch in private jets to major events around the world and the two remain so friendly that they are due to spend time together in a private capacity in June. It is certain, therefore, that Coe will take the opportunity to ask Samaranch to help him bring the Olympics to London. Though Samaranch stood down as president in 2001, he still wields plenty of power among IOC members. It is estimated that, if a vote for 2012 were held today, London would poll 24 to 30 votes. That is not enough but, if Coe can persuade Samaranch to help deliver another 20 members, then suddenly London's chances look much rosier. \"Even when it was unpopular within the BOA, I have only ever believed that London is our only chance,\" said Coe. \"I come to this with an advantage. I was born in London but I've not lived exclusively in London. I was brought up in the north, I was educated in the East Midlands. I know this country extremely well. I'm not someone who views this through the wrong end of a telescope.\" Coe finally appears to be fulfilling his destiny as Britain's leading sports politician. He came out of his blocks quickly. As long ago as 1984 he began to serve on various sporting committees, became vice-chairman of the Sports Council (now Sport England) and even a member of the Health Education Authority. He is widely credited during his time at the Sports Council with introducing the world's first widespread out-of-competition drugs-testing programme, something else that will be useful to point out to IOC members who may doubt Britain's commitment to drug-free sport following the disgraceful sacking of Britain's anti-doping head Michele Verroken earlier this year. He is also a member of the ruling council of the International Association of Athletics Federations, a position that will help him influence where the Olympics may be heading. Nevertheless this morning Coe must still feel as he did in the LA Coliseum 20 years ago when on the final lap everyone predicted the favourite Cram would pull away from him. He defied the odds then and will be hoping to do the same again in July 2005 in Singapore."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
