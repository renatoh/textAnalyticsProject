You need to earn \u00a354,000 on average", "bodyText": "First-time buyers now need an average income of \u00a354,000 to purchase a typical property in a UK city, but the priciest locations have become a little more affordable, according to the latest data. This average income required has risen by 9% since 2016, when it was \u00a349,900, largely down to higher house prices, said the property website Zoopla. Earlier this week, official data showed average UK house prices increased by 1.4% in the year to April, down from a 1.6% rise in the 12 months to March, with property prices continuing to fall in London. Zoopla looked at 20 cities that account for more than one-third of the UK\u2019s housing stock and found Liverpool had the lowest gross household income required for first-time buyers at \u00a326,000. In London, meanwhile, those who have never owned before need an average household income of \u00a384,000 to purchase a property. While this may seem unattainably high for many would-be purchasers, Zoopla said it was the lowest figure for four years and \u00a33,250 less than the amount required in 2016. \u201cThis follows three years of weak growth and small price falls in the capital, where prices are now beginning to stabilise,\u201d said a spokesman. The site put the current average price of a home in London at \u00a3482,000, compared with an average of \u00a3256,000 for the 20 cities analysed and \u00a3219,000 for the UK as a whole. Cambridge and Oxford require the highest typical household incomes of anywhere outside the capital, at \u00a372,000 and \u00a369,000 respectively. However, these were down on \u00a376,000 and \u00a371,000 respectively three years ago. Zoopla recorded the average price in Cambridge as \u00a3422,000 and \u00a3407,000 in Oxford. While Liverpool was named the most affordable market for first-time buyers, it was also the city with the highest house price growth, of 5% over the 12 months to May. In contrast, prices in the capital fell by 0.4% over the same period and by more than 4% in Aberdeen, where the property market is heavily reliant on the North Sea oil and gas industry. Tumbling oil prices have had a big impact on the port city. Richard Donnell, Zoopla\u2019s research and insight director, said: \u201cWhile the average household income to buy a typical home across UK cities has grown 9% since 2016, weaker price growth and recent price falls have led to a 5% reduction in the income to buy across the most expensive cities. It will come as a modest relief for would-be buyers, though the income to purchase still remains relatively high.\u201d The website makes a number of assumptions to calculate its figures \u2013 for example, Zoopla assumes 30% of net household income is spent on mortgage costs and that a deposit of 15% is put down (25% in London, Oxford and Cambridge)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
