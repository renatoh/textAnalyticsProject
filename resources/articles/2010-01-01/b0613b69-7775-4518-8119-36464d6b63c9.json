The game has a long history of trouble between the rival sets of supporters and Ferguson will remind his team that Greater Manchester police have deemed it a high-risk occasion and that they should not do anything to stoke the feelings unnecessarily. \"I don't have to spell out what Leeds have meant to Manchester United over the years,\" the United manager said. \"It will be a fantastic, feisty occasion, just like every time we have met, but it has always carried a degree of hostility which has meant we have to tell the players to behave themselves on the pitch because there is no need to add to the problems off the pitch. Leeds are bringing 8,000 fans and it is going to be a busy day for the police but it will be a brilliant atmosphere.\" Ferguson has vivid memories of the way the rivalry between the two clubs can spill over, and particularly remembers Eric Harrison, a member of his backroom staff, being attacked during a pitch invasion at Elland Road one year, and tea was thrown at members of the Old Trafford board, hitting Sir Bobby Charlton's wife, in the directors' box. Another time, Ferguson went to watch a match at Leeds and got stuck at traffic lights outside the ground. He tells the story of \"this bunch of supporters, skinheads, 20 or 30 of them, see me and go 'Ferguson!' and start running across the road. The lights are still red, I'm almost shitting myself, they're getting nearer, then the light goes to amber and [impersonation of a tyre-squeal] I'm away.\" Nonetheless, there is something about the tribal nature of these fixtures that appeals to Ferguson's competitive spirit. \"I used to enjoy the games, we had some great games over there. The atmosphere was always electric at Leeds and our record was pretty good there too. We only lost once at Elland Road and you had to perform there.\" This is the first time the clubs have come up against one another since Leeds were relegated from the Premier League in 2004. \"The first problem with Leeds was financial because they had to sell their best players,\" Ferguson said. \"That's what happens if you are financially strained and, if you sell your best players, you can bet your life that the results will change, too. But I don't think they will be too far away from the Premier League in the next couple of years. They look to be an absolute certainty for the Championship [Leeds are top of League One] and they have a great chance of being in the Premier League in the next couple of years.\" The first leg of United's Carling Cup semi-final against Manchester City at Eastlands is on Wednesday but Ferguson said that would not come prominently into his thinking when naming his side to face Leeds. Gary Neville and Paul Scholes are both in line to be recalled after recovering from respective injuries, and Ferguson then intends to use the younger members of his squad against City. \"I will stick with the principle of picking young players on Wednesday,\" he said. \"That is what we have done in the Carling Cup and we are not changing that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
