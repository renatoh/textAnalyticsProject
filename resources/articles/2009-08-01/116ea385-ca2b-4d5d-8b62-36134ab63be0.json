Imagine the emptiness of a world before wheelie suitcases, or the alcoholic energy drink, a device that works the miracle of making you want both to stand up and fall over simultaneously. Similarly, while watching the cricket it's tempting to wonder how we managed pre-Shane Warne, darling of the Sky Sports commentary box. During the Ashes series Warne has seemed to wax in stature until he now bestrides the TV-sport horizon. Like the royal wedding or 4,000 pony-tailed plumbers dancing in a field in 1989, he is perhaps now close to his own era-defining accolade: 2009, The Summer Of Shane. After Headingley this looks like a crush that can survive good times and bad. Even as England were collapsing Warne remained discreet and solicitous, and at his best in the company of David Lloyd. There's an air of easy wise-crackery between them, reminiscent of a well-seasoned movie cop pairing from a 1980s Hollywood action franchise: Lloyd the paternal older cop who drives the car and makes wry remarks; Warne the charismatic maverick who gets too close to the case. \"What have you been up to this week, Bumble?\" Warne asked. \"I've been in LA for a couple of days.\" \"LA? Really?\" \"Yes, Lower Accrington.\" As a feral Aussie fielding unit yacked its way through another bruising over, Lloyd noted admiringly that there was \"Some real rattle out there\", and in truth there was a lot of rattle from Sky too. They seem to be talking more than they used to, perhaps driven by the incredible amount of information they now have to cram in, from the regal blue of the stat boxes and fact-tickers to the ever-louder stump mics so that an England batsman facing the dragging delivery stride of Mitchell Johnson makes a thunderous \"hhhwwchch... thrccckk\" noise. Plus you get to see the guys in the box a lot: from David Gower looking ever more like a suave international jewel thief with a trail of ruined heiresses in his wake to the great Shane himself, who on TV has something soft-focus and rubberised about him. It's the face of a successful US motivational guru in an uplifting 15-minute infomercial for a DVD self-help plan called You Loving You For You. It's a face that seemed brilliantly at home during Warne's appearance \u2013 as part of the ongoing Summer of Shane \u2013 on Channel Four's Alan Carr: Chatty Man. This could have been tricky. Carr has built his success on a comedy persona so camp it seems only a matter of time before his career is shattered by tabloid revelations of a secret female \"companion\" \u2013 the wedding, the suburban house, the two-in-a-bed romps behind the respectable face of extreme public gayness. \"Please welcome one of the greatest sportsman ever, Shayyyyyyyne Waaaaawwwwwn!\" Carr announced, and you feared for our man. But Warne breezed it and even managed to get a sledge in. Asked about the South African batsman Daryll Cullinan replying to his \"I've been waiting for this for two years\" with the line \"it looks like you spent most of them eating\", Warne reflected for a moment and added: \"Yeah. But he was still shit.\" If you wanted to criticise Sky's coverage of the cricket you'd probably say that what with Warne's star presence and all the pulsing on-screen periphery, one of the great pleasures of the English summer \u2013 watching cricket with the sound down and Test Match Special on the radio \u2013 has been largely spoilt. You can't concentrate now. The TMS voices are no longer filling the gaps between balls, because there are no gaps, just extreme close-ups of umpire Asad Rauf's straggly mullet and lightweight straw hat of an ice cream vendor in a 1950s American diner. It's a shame, because there are things Sky could learn from the BBC. Jonathan Agnew is still the maestro at filling dead air unobtrusively, a man with a voice so soothing it lilts and falls like a pleasantly riffing muted trumpet. Plus, TMS is spikier than Sky, a talking shop where people have opinions and even disagree, not least the increasingly shrill Geoff Boycott. \"Have you played here when it's hopping around like this?\" Boycott was asked by the excellent guest Aussie, Jim Maxwell. \"Call this hopping around? You don't know what you're talking about,\" Boycott spat back. Only Henry \"He's in. He's up to the wicket. He bowls. \" Blofeld grates. At Headingley he sounded like a man overheard talking too loudly in a confined public space, like a lift or a minibus. It is a difficult balancing act, to know when to stop talking, or in Sky's case jabbing you in the ribs with some fresh Nasa-technology replay device. As Agnew observed, describing James Anderson getting the ball to swing: \"Sometimes the more you strive and sweat and try to force it, the less likely it is to work.\" Something for Sky to think about, perhaps, when the Summer Of Shane has finally passed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
