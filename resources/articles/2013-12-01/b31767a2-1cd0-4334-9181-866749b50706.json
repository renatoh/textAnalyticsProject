But I knew there was something wrong when the actors on stage appeared to stop and were staring intently at the back of the theatre. I followed their eyes and saw a cloud of brown and grey material moving towards me. My boyfriend and I and our guests ducked as the dust cloud passed over us. I breathed the dust in. It wasn't painful initially but you could feel it afterwards. My hair was matted with dust. We then realised we had to get out; there was no time to feel scared. The performance of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time had been under way for around 40 minutes when the chaos erupted. It's a noisy, vigorous play and there was a scene where they are on a beach. I became aware of a noise at the back of the theatre on the other side. It was a clattering noise and then screams started. I thought it was part of the play and I realised it wasn't when I saw the actors looking at that area and they must have stopped acting. We were sitting four rows from the front, to the left of the stage. Everyone moved out. The lights came on and we went out the doors that we came in. There was a rush but no pushing. I checked that everyone in my group was OK. The air was filled with dust and it was impossible to see any damage or injured people. As I moved through the lobby, I saw people covered in dust like me but without injuries. The emergency services arrived shortly afterwards. I went back to the theatre. I could see someone lying on the floor being treated in the foyer and a woman seated in a chair. There was a family outside, a young boy and a mother. The mother had a lot of blood running down her face. Ambulance staff loaded the less seriously injured on to two double-decker buses, wrapped in blankets and some with bandages. The buses then took the injured to nearby hospitals. Rachel Williams was talking to Conal Urquhart"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
