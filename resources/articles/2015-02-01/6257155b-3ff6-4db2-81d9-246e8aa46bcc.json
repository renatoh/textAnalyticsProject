All those who featured at the Millennium Stadium in 2013 need no extra motivation and even non-participants such as Dave Attwood are hungry for redemption on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a case of trying to weather the Welsh storm,\u201d mutters the big Bath forward. \u201cWe will go there with our own intensity.\u201d It will not be straightforward but England feel more streetwise these days. The lights, the crowd, the occasion: the visitors insist they will be ready for all of it this time, with or without the use of loudspeakers at training this week to replicate the Millennium noise levels. \u201cIf you get dazzled by the starlight you get nowhere,\u201d says Attwood flatly. \u201cSince that game two years ago there\u2019s been an emphasis on being calmer under pressure and making better decisions. Some people will look at Friday in an intimidating light but it\u2019s like playing against Richie McCaw and the All Blacks. You have to treat them as normal blokes who play rugby the same as you. Then it becomes more of a level playing field.\u201d Attwood, who will be calling England\u2019s lineouts, has never played at the Millennium but has learned over the years how to stop \u201cthe starlight\u201d from becoming too bright. A heavy European defeat for Bath against Leinster at the Aviva Stadium is a particular reference point. \u201cI remember looking at their lineup and thinking: \u2018Wow, this is awesome.\u2019 The lights in the Aviva Stadium, so many fans, all that noise. Then it was: \u2018Oh, we\u2019re playing rugby as well.\u2019 Then it was \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve lost by 50 points.\u2019 That other stuff is wonderful for creating memories but the best memory is if you win the game.\u201d Having grown up in north Bristol, the 27-year-old also needs no lecturing on the tribal nature of Anglo-Welsh rivalry. He firmly disagrees that English fans somehow care less about beating Wales than vice versa. \u201cSometimes it comes across that English fans are a bit more blas\u00e9 than the Welsh when it comes to supporting the national team but I think that balance has been redressed in recent years. I certainly know English fans who are as passionate as any Welsh fans I\u2019ve ever met. Given the profile of rugby in England this year there is even more buzz amongst the fans. That\u2019s only going to do good things for us.\u201d The other key element, he feels, is staying calm in the long hours before the Cardiff showdown. \u201cI know some guys get a live feed off the emotional buzz when you\u2019re on the bus to the stadium and people are shouting, throwing things and getting really lairy in the street. Obviously it\u2019s incredibly loud and passionate and every Welsh person you speak to for 30 years will talk about the outcome. But in terms of preparing yourself to play rugby it\u2019s not something I find particularly useful.\u201d Instead he prefers to seek inspiration from within; few players anywhere are better at articulating the thrill of representing their country. \u201cWhen you run out there\u2019s this wall of noise. As the flames go off the air is still hazy and it looks like you can see the noise. It\u2019s the most unbelievable feeling. Even thinking about it now I\u2019ve got little tingles on my arms. Every time you play for England is a chance to make history. It\u2019s just such an exciting thing. You get that buzz every single time.\u201d The hosts will be feeling something similar; the difference is that Wales do not have England\u2019s current injury problems. With the tighthead prop David Wilson nursing a neck problem, Stuart Lancaster is set to be without yet another key man to add to the dozen players already unavailable. On the flip side the situation offers starts to Jonathan Joseph, James Haskell, George Kruis and, potentially, Kieran Brookes. Attwood, as a consequence, still reckons England can rise from the treatment table and enjoy a good Six Nations. \u201cWhen a guy comes in he comes in with such hunger and enthusiasm he drags the team with him.\u201d There is also the minor matter of this autumn\u2019s World Cup. If ever there was a moment for an English rugby player to make himself undroppable, now is it. Attwood, though, does not believe Friday\u2019s winners will necessarily have an edge when the teams meet in their crucial World Cup pool fixture. \u201cThere may be an element of psychological advantage but I think it will be fairly weak in terms of making real comparisons about what is to come. We\u2019ll focus on winning the Six Nations and maybe look back at this match when we get to the World Cup. We can\u2019t even begin to draw those comparisons now.\u201d England, in short, will be drawing more inspiration from the past than the future. \u201cI wasn\u2019t involved two years ago but I know from the analysis we\u2019ve done that there was an element of being caught unawares,\u201d says Attwood. \u201cA couple of things didn\u2019t go our way and we didn\u2019t respond terribly well.\u201d That painful lesson has been absorbed as England await their Cardiff retake. \u201cWe may be fresh-faced in comparison to plenty of their guys but we\u2019ll find a way to do what we need to do,\u201d said Attwood. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge but it\u2019s one we\u2019re extremely keen to meet.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
