At that time Tolkien was famous for just one book, his children's novel, The Hobbit, which had been published to great acclaim 11 years earlier. The medieval style of some of Baynes's drawings were ideally suited for Tolkien's Farmer Giles of Ham, which he had also written before the second war, but which was only to be published in 1949. Baynes produced pen and ink drawings and three coloured plates, which Tolkien humorously maintained reduced his text to a \"commentary\". At the end of the 1940s another author, and good friend of Tolkien, was CS Lewis, and he also liked Baynes's illustrations. The result was a commission to illustrate the book for which both author and illustrator are best remembered, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, published in 1950. Six more volumes were to follow of what would be known as the Chronicles of Narnia, concluding with The Last Battle, in 1956. Baynes went on to become one of the foremost children's book illustrators of the 20th century. Her highly designed style - witty, inventive and invariably bursting beyond the borders of the page - her strong sense of colour and line, and her careful attention to detail would become instantly recognisable. As for Narnia, despite other artists ringing the changes from time to time with the covers, sometimes disastrously, it is her classic line drawings which have remained an integral part of every subsequent edition of the series. Born in Brighton, Baynes was the younger of the two daughters. She spent the first few years of her life in India, where her father was employed in the civil service. At the age of five she returned to England with her mother and sister, Angela, and lived in a series of hotels and rented rooms, in and around Farnham, in Surrey, when she was not boarding at the now defunct Beaufront girl's school in Camberley. Later she was educated at the Farnham School of Art and - for two terms only - at the Slade School of Art in London. She studied design, but never gained any formal qualification. During the second world war, because of her art training, she made models for the Royal Engineers' camouflage unit (1940-42), then at Farnham Castle. She then moved to the Admiralty's hydrographics department in Bath (1942-45), drawing maps and nautical charts. Contact with a publisher colleague in the camouflage unit led to her first professional commissions in the early 1940s. By the end of the decade she had amassed a respectable body of published work. Then came Tolkien, and indeed, when The Hobbit appeared in a single print run as a Puffin edition in 1961, she provided the cover for it. It could be argued that the popularity of the Narnia books has overshadowed the rest of Baynes's astonishingly large body of work. She prided herself on her meticulous research and had a huge and eclectic working library from which she drew her inspiration. In 1957 she illustrated Amabel Williams-Ellis's edition of The Arabian Nights, and five years later came Tolkien's The Adventures of Tom Bombadil. Iona and Peter Opie's Puffin Book of Nursery Rhymes was published in 1963. In 1964 there was Tree and Leaf by Tolkien and in 1966 she worked with the creator of Little Grey Rabbit, Alison Uttley, on Recipes from an Old Farmhouse. Tolkien's Smith of Wootton Major followed in 1967. In 1968 she won the Kate Greenaway Medal for her illustrations to Grant Uden's A Dictionary of Chivalry. She almost managed to duplicate this achievement when she was runner up for her artwork for Helen Piers's Spider and Snail (1972). Her other books included Rosemary Harris's The Enchanted Horse (1981), The Story of Daniel by George MacBeth (1986) and The Moses Basket (2003) by Jenny Koralek. She wrote books as well as illustrating them. These included Victoria and the Golden Bird (1948), How Dog Began (1985), Good King Wenceslas (1987) and The Elephant's Ball (2007). It was partly because of a scarcity of commissions, latterly some measure of independent financial security and an inability to cease creating - she would refer to this as her \"obsession\" - that she produced works from her own rich imagination. There was a return to Tolkien in 1990 (Bilbo's Last Song) and Lewis with Peter Dickinson's A Book of Narnians (1994). It was somewhat to her chagrin that she developed a reputation over the years as an illustrator of mostly Christian works and, to redress the balance, one of her last creations (her \"children\" as she called them) was a series of designs for selections from the Qur'an, scheduled for publication in 2009. A project for some 40 illustrations for Aesop's fables remains unfinished at her death. Dogs were a great passion in her life as well as music, mostly Handel, which she would have playing in the background while working. In 1961 she married a German ex-prisoner of war, Fritz Otto Gasch. They set up home in a small village just outside Farnham, and Fritz died in 1988. \u00b7 Pauline Baynes, illustrator, born September 9 1922; died August 1 2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
