The mellow 35-year-old from Nottingham beat Ian McCulloch 13-8 to reach the quarter-finals of the World Championship. The manner in which Hamilton pulled away from an 8-8 overnight stalemate was a source of justified satisfaction, but the conditions brought only dissatisfaction from a player the master of ceremonies delights in calling 'The Sheriff of Pottingham'. Hamilton, a serial and self-confessed under-achiever, eased into his fourth Crucible quarter-final with a fi ve-frame run to the line fuelled by breaks of 65, 111, 107 and 91. It was a quality display under pressure . 'There was a lot of packing under the [table's] legs. You had to change your whole stance. I might have to start wearing platform shoes,' said Hamilton, the No 16 seed, who will certainly need to be on his toes next time out against Stephen Maguire, a 13-8 victor over Joe Swail. Matthew Stevens, twice a Crucible runner-up and three times a semi-fi nalist, advanced by beating Mark Allen 13-9 and will meet Shaun Murphy, in a repeat of the 2005 fi nal. Then Murphy prevailed 18-16 and should Stevens fail to exact revenge, he will be relegated from the elite worldranking top 16. Stephen Hendry, who astonished many of his fellow competitors by electing to employ a new cue only three weeks before the event, trails Ali Carter 6-2 after an opening session in which the underdog prospered with a 96 per cent pot success rate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
