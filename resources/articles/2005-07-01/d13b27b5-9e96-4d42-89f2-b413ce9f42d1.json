But the real contentment at his abrupt departure yesterday was felt in bucketloads by investors in the cars group. They sent the shares up 9%, adding more than \u20ac3.5bn (\u00a32.4bn) to its value, and voiced delight that the chief executive they wanted out 18 months ago was finally quitting. They are right. Schrempp, an arrogant, domineering chief, should have stepped down last year at the latest. Instead, he used his charisma and close links to the supervisory board to engineer a four-year extension of his contract. Schrempp, who took over from Edzard Reuter a decade ago, suffered (like his predecessor) from global delusions. Reuter failed to make the then Daimler-Benz an industrial conglomerate, and Schrempp's vision of a world-beating transport group has also failed. The main charge against him is not that, as a former boss of the aerospace business, he bought the bankrupt Dutch plane-maker Fokker. Nor even that he was the architect of the doomed partnership with Japan's Mitsubishi, let alone the troubled merger with America's Chrysler or the launch of the cute but heavily loss-making Smart car. It is that he neglected the group's flagship brand, Mercedes. In recent years, it has become a byword for declining quality and technical failings - rather than the symbol of German design and engineering excellence it once was - and has fallen behind arch-rival BMW. The huge losses in the first quarter are testimony to the manner in which Schrempp and his team took their eye off the ball. It will be up to Dieter Zetsche, the new chief executive from January 1, to mirror his success in bringing Chrysler back into profit - achieved by sacking a fifth of the workforce and manufacturing new models. Schrempp, who earns about \u20ac7.5m and is leaving without a pay-off, was an old-style corporate boss who relied on his ties with the network of financial institutions and unions to steer the company. He stood for much of the postwar consensus and remained a supporter of co-determination, the system giving unions a say in running the business. His real legacy can be seen in yesterday's rise in the shares to \u20ac40 - just \u20ac60 short of the price before the Chrysler merger. Medicine man Despite some hairy moments when regulators rejected two major drugs, Sir Tom McKillop survived for six years. He also kept snarling at his critics to the last by producing a cracking set of figures yesterday. It was an honourable innings in tough conditions for the pharmaceutical industry. The share price may be virtually where it was on the day in 1999 that Astra and Zeneca combined, but many rivals have fared worse. Indeed, the FTSE 100 index itself has. But even McKillop might admit he would have liked to have achieved more. Back in 1999, AstraZeneca's major drug was the ulcer treatment Losec, accounting for 39% of sales. In 2005, Losec's successor, Nexium, is the biggest earner at 19% of sales and rising. It implies diversification, but not to the degree expected. The blame falls on last year's 11th-hour failures of Iressa, for lung cancer, and Exantia, for blood-thinning. US regulators' double refusal made a nonsense of McKillop's boasts that AstraZeneca had the industry's best pipeline of new drugs. Instead, all sorts of questions were raised about the quality of AZ's drug development. Answers will only emerge after he has gone. Where he has undoubtedly excelled is in cost-cutting and productivity improvements within the sales force. However, such gains tend to reinforce the idea that modern pharmaceutical companies are led by their sales and marketing sides and not by their scientists. Once the big cost savings have been made, the urge to merge usually returns, and McKillop will leave AstraZeneca as an efficient, cash-generative business ripe for another deal. What price GlaxoZeneca by the end of the decade? Long innings A third boss in the departure lounge yesterday produced swansong interims that summed up his tenure: \"Broadly in line with consensus, nothing to get excited about,\" as one analyst said. Legal &amp; General's Sir David Prosser - who will skip through the executive exit at the end of this year - has been in his job since 1991 and is the FTSE-100's longest-serving chief executive. He turned focus into an art form and L&amp;G has outperformed the FTSE 100 for a decade. His strategy has been to stick to his knitting, stay sharp on costs and pricing, and stay in Britain. Prosser's L&amp;G now so regularly delivers on expectations that it is labelled dull. But let's not get too carried away. On Prosser's watch, there have been some serious problems: like the 1990s pensions mis-selling scandal - L&amp;G was one of the worst offenders and a laggard in providing compensation. Then there are the thousands of homeowners mis-sold endowments, and many more facing serious shortfalls in the cash they had expected to repay mortgages. Prosser defeated the FSA in a spat over a \u00a31.1m fine for the mis-selling and the penalty has been halved. But L&amp;G was still guilty. From the shareholders' point of view the Prosser years have been good. But there is more to success than that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
