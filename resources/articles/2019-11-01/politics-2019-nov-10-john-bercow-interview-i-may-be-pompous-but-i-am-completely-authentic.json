But I am completely authentic\u2019", "bodyText": "When John Bercow bowed out as Speaker of the House of Commons last month \u2013 in the chamber, he listened uncomplainingly for just under three hours to MPs lavishly buttering him with praise \u2013 the attention of one newspaper diarist was drawn by rumours of the sight of a somewhat unlikely observer in the gallery. Who was this attentive fellow, and what was it that he was scribbling so assiduously in his notebook? Later, a name was supplied. Apparently, it was none other than the actor Tom Hollander, who may or may not be preparing to play the former Speaker on screen. If Bercow the biopic is shortly to become a reality, Hollander will have his work cut out. It\u2019s not only that he\u2019ll have to get the voice right (at his best \u2013 or worst, depending on your point of view \u2013 Bercow sounds like Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh in the 1935 movie Mutiny on the Bounty). Actually, that\u2019s the easy part (\u201cOrder, orr-duu-rrr!\u201d). It\u2019s the personality that\u2019s trickier to catch. Crikey, but he\u2019s a strange mix. Yes, as even he admits, he is pompous, irascible, long-winded, pig-headed and, at times, utterly irritating. But he\u2019s also quick, warm, quite funny and, most surprisingly of all for a politician, capable of great, almost dazzling, honesty. In summary, all of his emotions are perilously close to the surface and you must be prepared for spillages, even as you struggle to follow his endlessly unspooling paragraphs. In 25 years, I\u2019ve never interviewed someone more difficult to interrupt, or more prone to tears. When we meet in a Soho club, he has been a civilian \u2013 no longer the Speaker, and no longer the MP for Buckingham, the seat he has represented since 1997 \u2013 for three days. What is he feeling? Is it grief, or relief? \u201cI don\u2019t feel grief,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if I say relief\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say that, because it was the greatest privilege of my life. It probably sounds trite, but it\u2019s too early to know how I\u2019m going to feel. I had a structure, and now that structure is gone, and it is discombobulating. In 10 years [as Speaker], I missed Prime Minister\u2019s Questions twice, on both occasions to speak at funerals. The question arises: whither now?\u201d Will he go to the Lords? Convention dictates that the Speaker head to the upper house on retirement, but there is talk that pesky Bercow will be denied this privilege (talk that emanated first from the camp of an increasingly furious Theresa May earlier this year). \u201cThat\u2019s for other people to decide,\u201d he says, with utmost graciousness, \u201cbut yes, I would accept, if it was offered to me. I want to write, consult, have fun, and do good. I want to ensure that I\u2019m solvent, and I would like to speak to a wide variety of audiences around the world. That would appeal. What I loathe and fear is dancing.\u201d So, no Strictly, then? Certainly not. What about the election? How is he going to vote? \u201cYou can ask me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d Oh, please tell me. \u201cNo.\u201d As I\u2019m sure he knows \u2013 he wears the smile of an assassin \u2013 this is still an answer of a kind: given that he was a Conservative MP only five minutes ago, one would assume that if his intention was to vote Tory, he\u2019d simply say so. But it\u2019s also odd, this being one of only two matters on which he will hold back (the other is the allegations of bullying made against him in 2018, which he will not discuss beyond saying: \u201cI\u2019ve never bullied anyone in my life\u201d). He certainly isn\u2019t convinced the Tories will win. \u201cThe polls are volatile. The Conservatives are somewhat ahead. But they need to be 10 points ahead to be confident of a majority.\u201d Either way \u2013 a Tory majority, or not \u2013 he doesn\u2019t think the election will \u201csort\u201d the issue of Brexit. \u201cThis is just phase one. We\u2019ve yet to have the debate about the trade deal between the UK and the EU, and between the UK and the rest of the world. We\u2019re still going to be talking about this in five years, and possibly in 15 years.\u201d Does this depress him? \u201cI don\u2019t easily get depressed but my personal view is that Brexit is the biggest foreign policy mistake in the postwar period.\u201d For the past three years, Bercow has presided over the efforts of first Theresa May\u2019s government, and then that of Boris Johnson, to pass a bill on Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU through the House of Commons. It wasn\u2019t work that he ever anticipated having to do. On the night of the referendum in June 2016, watching the television in his children\u2019s playroom at Speaker\u2019s House, he was as surprised as anyone by the result. \u201cA lot of us in the political class are too London-centric, and that must apply to me, too, because I thought most Brits would, in a pragmatic way, vote to remain.\u201d Once a new prime minister had been installed in No 10, however, his amazement only grew. \u201cI had assumed that the architects of, and proselytisers for, Brexit would have a clear idea of what they wanted,\u201d he says. \u201cI was surprised there wasn\u2019t greater clarity. I would say that Brexiteers bear some share of the blame for the delay because they did not have an agreed approach to delivery. There are, for instance, prominent Brexiteers who very publicly stated that achieving a trade deal with the EU would be absolutely straightforward.\u201d Does he mean Liam Fox, the former secretary of state for international trade? Apparently, he does. \u201cQuite why he thought that, you\u2019d have to ask him. On average, a trade deal between two willing parties takes seven years to implement.\u201d The other problem was the attitude of Theresa May. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she bears me any ill will. I don\u2019t bear her any. She was doing her best. But there was one major problem. The government pursued its approach as though it had an absolute right to parliamentary delivery \u2013 even when it was a minority government [after the 2017 election]. There is a respectable argument for saying that it was incumbent upon it to try and achieve a wider consensus; to reach out to other parties. But no serious effort was made to do that.\u201d Throughout all this, Bercow was determined, as he had been ever since his election as Speaker in 2009, to protect the rights of the backbencher, ensuring that the executive could not force its will on the House. Some, however, saw his actions as unforgivably political, and slanted in favour of remain. In March, to the fury of many, he prevented May from bringing a third vote on her withdrawal agreement, quoting a convention that went back to 1604. In September, he allowed rebel MPs to take control of the Commons agenda to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Unsurprisingly, he defends his impartiality in this period: \u201cThe evidence overwhelmingly shows that I was completely fair. I reject the charge that I was the agent of remainers.\u201d However, this doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s impartial now. Far from it. He sounds to me like someone who has won a famous victory: a triumphant partisan by any other name. Take, for instance, the prorogation of parliament last August. When he heard that this was what Boris Johnson was planning, he was in Turkey with his family. \u201cWithin an hour, I\u2019d issued a statement to say I thought it was a constitutional outrage. That annoyed some: they said it wasn\u2019t for me to pronounce. But if the Speaker doesn\u2019t speak up for parliament, it\u2019s hard to know who does.\u201d A few days later, though, the supreme court ruled that the prorogation was, indeed, illegitimate. \u201cAn 11-nil verdict!\u201d he says, like the Arsenal fan that he is. He looks at me steadily. \u201cDo you understand if I say that when people know you were wrong, they find it easier to forgive you? But that when they know you were right, they don\u2019t like it?\u201d I nod. \u201cWell, did they come and apologise? No, they just attacked the court instead.\u201d Where does he think the impulse for this prorogation came from? \u201cI find it hard to penetrate the recesses of their fertile minds,\u201d he says. \u201cThey say they weren\u2019t seeking to stop debate, but it absolutely was not a normal prorogation.\u201d His voice begins to rise. \u201cIt was declared illegitimate. Ultra vires. Not proper. And, crucially, void. I repeat: void. Void. Void. Invalid. It didn\u2019t happen.\u201d By now, I\u2019m holding up a finger to indicate that, yes, I\u2019ve got the message. But it\u2019s no good. \u201cExpunged from the record. Expunged. Not deleted. Expunged. That conveys an impression of some force. You can imagine a team of people with clothes doing the sponging, wiping it away.\u201d You sound quite glad about this, I say. \u201cYes, I am glad about it,\u201d he replies. There is a theory that Bercow, whose father was a cab driver, is motivated more than anything by social class. Having sometimes found himself the victim of snobbery, it is the fuel on which his engine runs, the spur for his greatest feuds and grudges. He tells me that he gets on well with Boris Johnson, whom he finds \u201cpersonable\u201d, but that he was rather less keen on David Cameron. \u201cHe was immensely capable on his feet, very dextrous, and on big occasions, he could be impressive\u2026\u201d Is there a \u2018but\u2019 coming? \u201cThere is, yes, and that is that David is relentlessly tactical rather than strategic. Let\u2019s face it, he chose to call the referendum. Was there a clamour for it? There was not. There was chuntering in his own party, but the public wasn\u2019t demanding one. He just thought it would work for him. He has the most enormous, probably public school-instilled, self-confidence. He thinks that people like him are born to rule, that the natural order is that people like him run things, and that he is in a superior position.\u201d Did Cameron and George Osborne, the former chancellor, bait him? \u201cI\u2019m not complaining. I didn\u2019t think George was mean. He is an icy calculator; when there is a strong difference of opinion, he\u2019s rather clinical.\u201d He makes his voice slightly posher, and a little bit Bond villain. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s nothing personal, but I am going to have to take you out. The exigencies of the time require it. I don\u2019t dislike you, but the time for your political assassination has arrived. The slot has been booked, the weapon has been identified.\u2019 David Cameron is a more emotional character. Was he mean to me? He did strongly object to my becoming Speaker. He was not keen on me at all, but then, when he stood for the leadership, I said I didn\u2019t think Oxford-hunting-shooting-fishing-membership-of-White\u2019s was a combination to appeal to the masses. I thought he was too privileged.\u201d Becoming Speaker, Bercow says, was his way of dealing with his feelings about parliamentary life. He didn\u2019t care for the front benches [he was shadow chief secretary to the Treasury under Iain Duncan Smith, and shadow secretary of state for international development under Michael Howard], but on the back benches he felt \u201cunrecognised, powerless\u2026 eventually I said to my wife: \u2018Honey, this is a recipe for unhappiness.\u2019\u201d Some time after this, he had a drink with the former MP Jonathan Aitken, whose godfather, Selwyn Lloyd, was Speaker in the 70s. \u201c\u2018There are other routes to fulfilment,\u2019 Jonathan said. He almost winked at me.\u201d Was this a lightbulb moment? \u201cYes.\u201d And did he always know he would be a reforming Speaker (among his reforms are, famously, the establishment of a nursery in what was previously the House of Commons pistol range; an increase in the use of urgent questions, whereby any MP can demand a minister comes to the dispatch box; and the abandonment of the Speaker\u2019s traditional dress)? \u201cNo, but the reforms were obvious.\u201d He wanted the place to be more open, welcoming and, well, normal. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be hermetically sealed in fancy dress.\u201d Such changes were, of course, all of a piece with what Bercow calls his \u201cpolitical journey\u201d, an ideological odyssey that began in Edgware, north London, where he was born in 1963. His father had a car business at the time, and his mother was a secretary, though they divorced when he was 12. He was a precocious child. One story has him sitting on the wall in front of the family home, ostentatiously reading the Times, the newspaper so huge, it all but hid him from view. He appeared on Crackerjack, the children\u2019s TV show and, as a teenager in the audience at Question Time, he lectured Barbara Castle, accusing her of having swapped the Commons for the European Parliament because she knew the Labour party had no future. He was also a tennis player: a Middlesex under-12s champion, no less. He shakes his head, forlornly. \u201cAs Jo Durie\u2019s coach once said to my mum: \u2018I don\u2019t think John is the most talented player on the circuit, but there are two things I admire about him: he will run for ever, and he cares massively about winning.\u2019\u201d But he disliked school. \u201cI was distracted by my parents\u2019 break-up. I was at sea for a period. I\u2019ve got some sad memories: terrible tensions between them, though much later they made up.\u201d He only got going at Essex University, where he received a first class degree in government. According to one commentator, by the time he was in his late teens, Bercow was \u201cmore rightwing than Marie-Antoinette\u201d: at university, he was a hang \u2019em, flog \u2019em type, a fierce opponent of the EU, and a member of the Monday Club, a notorious fringe group that was then aligned with the Tories. He was, in other words, the polar opposite, politically speaking, of the man who, in 2002, would resign from the shadow cabinet over his support for same-sex adoption. I wonder: is he embarrassed by his former self? I expect prevarication, some talk of youthful folly. But his response is straightforward. \u201cYes, very much so,\u201d he says. \u201cIn particular\u2026 \u201d (It\u2019s at this point that it happens for the first time: his eyes fill with tears and he chokes slightly on his words.) \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of having argued for the privatisation of the coal industry, or advocating tax of 15p in the pound. An intellectual case can be made [for those things]. No, the only thing I feel really ashamed about is that, when I joined the Monday Club, I joined its immigration, repatriation and race relations industry subcommittee. I\u2019m deeply ashamed of that.\u201d So why did he do it? \u201cYes, what on earth was this north London Jewish boy doing teaming up with a bunch of bigots, racists and crypto-fascists? I think I was rather influenced by my father, who in many respects was a good dad \u2013 honest, loyal, hard working, he\u2019s been dead for 33 years last week\u2026\u201d Again, the eyes brim and the voice cracks. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rubbish my dad, but it is possible for Jewish people to be racist, just as it is possible for people of other faiths to be. Dad was a creature of his time. He had a particular view about Commonwealth immigration. One day, I went to see him, and he mentioned Enoch Powell, whom he thought much maligned. I went off and read his [Powell\u2019s] speeches, and I thought: wow, he\u2019s got views about markets and price controls and Northern Ireland, and I fell for that. When you are a young person, you can be attracted by an ideology.\u201d So what changed? How did his move leftwards begin? \u201cIn the Monday Club, I came across people who were hardcore, disgusting racists, and antisemitic, too, and I recoiled, and left. But that was in 1984. I remained strongly Conservative for a long period. I was a Thatcherite until 2001.\u201d It was, he says, Tony Blair\u2019s second election victory that finally caused him to do some deep thinking. \u201cWe were smashed to smithereens. I thought: there\u2019s something wrong, here. The electorate cared about public services that we had under-resourced, and it cared about fairness. In our attitude to women and minorities, we came across as the nasty party, and I didn\u2019t think I was a nasty person.\u201d With this in mind, is he dismayed by the current mood? \u201cYes, there is a nastiness abroad. It is a pity.\u201d Again, he is on the verge of tears as he gasps out the words: \u201cIn the 1950s, there were notices in pubs that said: No blacks, no Irish, no dogs. The idea that there is a regression into an\u2026 atavistic camp is a tragedy.\u201d Has he received the kind of threats that many other MPs, particularly Jewish members, have recently described? \u201cOh, yes. But it\u2019s something I can shrug off. I don\u2019t want to be pious. I am capable of being upset from time to time. But have I lost a wink of sleep over this? No. I lose sleep about the health of a member of my family.\u201d At this point, beginning to sob, he asks me to switch off my tape recorder. When he has recovered, we talk about his wife and three children, with whom he has shared the \u201cbizarre, surreal\u201d experience of living in Speaker\u2019s House. Some have attributed the shift in his politics to the influence of his wife, Sally, a Labour supporter who famously has a \u201cBollocks to Brexit\u201d sticker on her car. But this doesn\u2019t seem to me quite right, not least because they met, in 1989, at a Conservative students\u2019 training conference. Was it love at first sight? \u201cI was very attracted to her, and I was completely amazed she had the remotest interest in me.\u201d Naturally, his determination kicked in. \u201cI worked at it. We had an on-off relationship, but I never gave up, and 13 years later, we got married.\u201d He says his wife has been a rock. But there have been \u2013 how to put this? \u2013 some challenges. She was photographed for a newspaper wearing only a sheet (power is an aphrodisiac, she said); appeared in reality TV shows; lost a libel case brought by Lord McAlpine; and had an affair with her husband\u2019s cousin. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve had periods of turbulence,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s well known that Sally left me for a period.\u201d How did he cope? It was so public. \u201cIn the Commons, a dear friend, Charles Walker [a Tory MP], came up to me and said: \u2018I don\u2019t know how you keep going. You must feel so embarrassed.\u2019 I said: \u2018I\u2019m not embarrassed. I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u2019 How did I cope? I compartmentalised.\u201d Did he know he\u2019d get her back? \u201cI didn\u2019t feel a great certainty, but I thought it was worth trying. I do [love her a lot], and I\u2019m happier together than apart.\u201d For one last time, his eyes grow watery. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for people to think the grass is greener. I like to stick with things.\u201d He must go now. The man from the speaking agency he has joined, desperate to talk to him, is tapping on the door. But I sense a certain reluctance: the result, I think, of a feeling on his part that, at last, he has the chance to show people what he is. \u201cThe way I talk is not an affectation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt came from my father, who also spoke in paragraphs. There are certain rather stupid political scribblers, pompous, public school idiots\u201d \u2013 I interrupt: can he possibly be referring to Quentin Letts? (Letts is the Times sketch-writer.) \u201cDid you say Lentin Quetts?\u201d he barks back. And now he really lets rip. \u201cThey have this stupid, bigoted, thick-as-pig-shit idea of me as someone who is just acting a part. It\u2019s just snobbery. Because public-school people are predestined: there\u2019s a map for them.\u201d Does he mean that they don\u2019t understand that the rest of us must be more pragmatic, perhaps shaking off versions of ourselves from time to time? He nods. \u201cI may be odd and pompous and an irritant. But I am completely authentic.\u201d He shows me the palms of his hands. \u201cThis is me,\u201d he says, sounding half dazed at the thought."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
