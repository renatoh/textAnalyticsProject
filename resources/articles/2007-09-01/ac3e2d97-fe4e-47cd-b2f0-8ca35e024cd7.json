Back in 1983, when Dein bought his first 16% of Arsenal for \u00a3292,000, football was a different, grittier game. The chairman Peter Hill-Wood's search for investment was a touch more difficult than today, when Usmanov and the US businessman Stan Kroenke are straining to have pieces of the club. After Dein bought the shares, Hill-Wood famously said: \"I think he's crazy. To all intents and purposes, it's dead money.\" Hill-Wood meant that practically and philosophically - you couldn't make money out of football clubs, and you weren't supposed to. The FA had rules preventing directors being paid salaries or shareholders huge dividends, and fans were charged peanuts to watch games. Buying into a club was not intended to be a businessman's investment but a commitment by becoming a \"custodian\" to look after the club for its supporters and future. Dein was an Arsenal fan and a trading entrepreneur, and he might have had a shrewder idea than Hill-Wood of how that culture might change, and where top-flight English football, and the value of shares in its clubs, could be taken. In 1990-91, on the eve of the Premier League revolution, Dein bought the majority of Hill-Wood's own shares. Dein, and others who bought stakes in the 1980s and early 90s, have since become the first football club shareholders ever to make vast amounts of money from selling them. The \u00a375m from Usmanov adds to an estimated \u00a311m Dein had made already by selling some of his stake to Danny Fiszman in the early 1990s. Whether Dein and the others were visionaries who foresaw today's television billions and the game's booming popularity, or parochial men who happened to be in control when, after Hillsborough, the game was forced to reinvent itself, is a point to ponder. Dein would say he bought the shares to be involved and contribute something to his club, and he had also seen sport in the US and believed football here should become similarly commercialised. He supported his club, but saw no conflict between that and making a fortune for himself out of it. The others who have cashed in seem to have shared that view. Crucial to the clubs swelling in value was the First Division's breakaway to form the Premier League in 1992. Dein himself privately lobbied the Football Association to support the breakaway, having, with Noel White of Liverpool, been deputed to approach the governing body by the self-appointed \"Big Five\" clubs - the others were Manchester United, Tottenham and Everton. The FA fatefully agreed, and the top clubs leapt away from sharing with the other three divisions their succession of fabulous TV deals, culminating in the Premier League's current \u00a32.7bn feast from 2007-10. Of the \"Big Five,\" only Everton have failed - so far - to deliver a fortune to its major shareholders. At Liverpool, the chief executive Rick Parry said it was, for the chairman David Moores, \"the worst day of his life\" when he sold his 51% to Tom Hicks and George Gillett earlier this year, but they paid \u00a35,000 per share, which made Moores \u00a389m. Alan Sugar paid \u00a38m to pull Spurs out of financial crisis in 1991. His Amstrad company was making the satellite dishes for BSkyB, and as the Tottenham chairman, Sugar's involvement was crucial the following year in sending the Premier League's vote Sky's way. Sugar sold his first tranche of shares to Enic for \u00a322m in December 2000, then in July this year Sugar - by now Sir Alan and a national treasure - sold his remaining 12% stake, again to Enic, for a further \u00a325m. Four weeks later he made another \u00a335m from selling Amstrad itself, to BSkyB. By then its main business was making set-top boxes for the satellite broadcaster. At Manchester United, Martin Edwards never saw a contradiction between working as the chief executive to build the club's success and making millions himself. His father, Louis, was a businessman and fan who became involved for the old classic reasons of wanting to buy into the heart of his club, and the family never looked to make big money out of United until 1978, when their meat business was declining. They then organised a rights issue which dramatically increased the dividends they could receive every year. Martin became the full-time chief executive in 1981 soon after the FA allowed directors to be paid, then in 1989, he agreed to sell his 50.6% stake to Michael Knighton for \u00a310m. The deal collapsed, and instead Martin made \u00a36m from selling some shares when United floated on the stock market in 1991. He sold the rest at intervals throughout United's rich years of Premiership success, finally reaching a total of \u00a393m when he sold the last to the Scottish mining entrepreneur Harry Dobson in 2002. Sir John Hall made the grandest of claims when he took over Newcastle United between 1989 and 1992; he was doing it, he said, for \"the Geordie nation,\" the club would be central to the north-east's renaissance, running it was part of his social conscience. The family's majority stake cost them around \u00a33m, and they too have since sold in stages - 9.8% to the cable company NTL for \u00a316m in 1998 and 1999, then in 2003, the club itself bought some of the family's shares back for \u00a34.5m. In June this year, Mike Ashley paid \u00a355.34m for the family's remaining 42% stake, bringing the total reaped by the Halls to \u00a375.8m. Freddy Shepherd, and his brother Bruce, who paid around \u00a32.4m for their 28% shareholding, received \u00a337.3m from Ashley. The outgoing club owners have mostly talked proudly of having steered their clubs into the golden age, but few have reflected publicly on the huge personal fortunes they have made from the game. For Steven Powell, director of policy and campaigns for the Football Supporters' Federation, the profits are excessive. \"Shareholders and directors were supposed to be custodians of clubs, not to make huge money for themselves,\" he argues. \"That has all changed. They have cashed in hugely while fans pay ever more for tickets.\" Terry Brown, the former West Ham chairman, bought his shares in 1992 for \u00a32m, and sold them last year to the Icelandic investors Eggert Magnusson and Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, for \u00a331m. \"I didn't expect to make money when I bought the shares,\" Brown says plainly. \"I was a lifelong fan, and bought them to prevent a takeover by others. We concentrated on developing the ground at Upton Park, then building the club. I accept I made some mistakes and was intensely disliked by fans at the end, but I tried to do my duty, and leave the club in good hands. \"The Premier League took off with the help of Sky. When the club's shares increased in value, Charles Warner [a West Ham shareholder] asked me if I foresaw it all happening, but I didn't. Nobody was more surprised than me.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
