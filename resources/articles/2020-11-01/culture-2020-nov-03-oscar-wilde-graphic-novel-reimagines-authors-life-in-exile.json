Javier de Isusi\u2019s graphic novel, The Divine Comedy of Oscar Wilde \u2013 which won Spain\u2019s national comic prize at the end of October \u2013 offers a sepia-tinted recreation of the writer\u2019s final three years in Paris after his release from Reading gaol. Though his wit remains sharp, the Wilde of Isusi\u2019s book is a bloated, and occasionally vomit-spattered, man of liquid breakfasts and empty pockets, forever in search of escape as he wanders towards death under the pseudonym of Sebastian Melmoth. For Isusi \u2013 who was so deeply influenced by Wilde\u2019s children\u2019s stories that his first book, written at the age of seven, was called The Ogre and the Mouse \u2013 the comic is partly the result of an attempt to reconcile the man who wrote The Happy Prince and The Selfish Giant with the author of The Picture of Dorian Gray. \u201cThey both fascinated me; one for his light \u2013 even though the stories were sad \u2013 and the other for his darkness,\u201d says Isusi. But it wasn\u2019t until six years ago, when he read De Profundis, the letter Wilde wrote while in Reading gaol, that Isusi began looking into Wilde\u2019s life. \u201cThe text is so moving that I thought to myself: \u2018Anyone who could have written this had to have done more than just ended up a semi-alcoholic nothing.\u2019 There had to be more than that.\u201d Isusi spent five years poring over biographies of Wilde and reading the accounts of those who had known him best, so while The Divine Comedy of Oscar Wilde is a reimagining of the writer\u2019s life between 1897 and 1900, it is firmly rooted in real-life encounters. As well as the inevitable meeting with his former lover Bosie \u2013 more properly known as Lord Alfred Douglas \u2013 there are appearances by the Spanish poets Manuel and Antonio Machado, the author Andr\u00e9 Gide and the painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. The story is interspersed with interviews with Wilde\u2019s friends and confidants, who speak directly to the reader. Some are candid; some reticent. Bosie reflects on his relationship with Wilde, noting that both his beauty and his reputation suffered the fate of Dorian Gray\u2019s likeness after he outlived the writer by almost half a century. \u201cI grew old, as you can see,\u201d he tells the reader as he ages rapidly over three panels. \u201cTo him, I was always young and beautiful but, for 45 years, I had to endure what time and life had done to my portrait.\u201d Wilde\u2019s friend Robbie Ross, meanwhile, raises the question that haunts every would-be Wilde biographer: \u201cI could tell you many things but what\u2019s the point? The world already has what it wants of Wilde: the perfect tragedy of someone who ascended to the Olympus of glory only to be cast down into a hell of humiliation and destitution. Why should I want to convince anyone otherwise?\u201d The book\u2019s climax imagines an impossible encounter with another poetic titan. After getting drunk with Toulouse-Lautrec and narrowly avoiding one of the painter\u2019s bullets \u2013 not to mention attempted blackmail by a sex worker \u2013 Wilde contemplates, and then decides against, pitching himself into the dark waters of the Seine. It is then that he hallucinates a conversation with Arthur Rimbaud. Rimbaud, dead for eight years, asks Wilde a not unreasonable question: \u201cWhen are you going to stop masturbating over your own image?\u201d That scene, says Isusi, is at the core of the book. \u201cThere are similarities between Rimbaud and Wilde: the two were born just four days apart; both stopped writing and wrote nothing but letters during their final years, and both were exiles, although in very different ways. Wilde was forced into exile but Rimbaud took himself off into exile.\u201d The po\u00e8te maudit\u2019s apparition pushes Wilde towards a hell and purgatory where, in drawings heavily influenced by William Blake\u2019s illustrations for Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy, he revisits his trial and imprisonment. When he emerges, Wilde is finally able to separate his life from his work and, as Isusi puts it, \u201clook almost happily on death. I wanted to show that things may look as though they\u2019re falling apart from the outside, but perhaps inside, you\u2019re living something far more liberating.\u201d The belated arrival at Wilde\u2019s deathbed of a character who has symbolised innocence suggests the writer has finally found a measure of peace. The boy crowns him with laurels and quotes the last words spoken in The Selfish Giant. Given Isusi\u2019s abundant love for Wilde, he seems an unlikely Judas. But has the book made him feel like one? \u201cI\u2019ll leave that up to the reader, but I don\u2019t think so. As Wilde pointed out, a work says a lot about its author. This is about how I want the end of Oscar Wilde\u2019s life to have been.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
