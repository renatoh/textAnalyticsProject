It's a big, big goal,\" he said. This year the Tour includes a flat stage in Corsica for its opener rather than a prologue time trial or a hilltop finish, which will give the sprinters their chance to take the race lead. \"It's the first opportunity for a sprinter to wear the jersey on the first day since the 1960s,\" said Cavendish. \"It will be all guns blazing.\" \"It's a strong group of sprinters this year; it won't be easy, especially in the first stage of the Tour. History has showed it normally takes me a few days to get into a Grand Tour. Not at the Giro this year but before that. \"I've altered my training to be able to go well in that first stage. We'll go for it but you have to show the Tour de France respect \u2013 nothing's a given. We'll try our best and see what happens.\" Looking further ahead into the Tour, Cavendish said he had identified seven stages as possible sprint finishes where he will attempt to continue the unprecedented run of victories which has seen him land 23 stages in five Tours. There is speculation that he will pass Eddy Merckx's overall record of career stage wins by 2015, although he is adamant this is not a target for him. This year, if all goes to plan, he could equal or pass the five-times winner Bernard Hinault, who lies second in the rankings on 28 stage wins. Cavendish was speaking at the launch of his new brand, CVNDSH, which has the motto FSTASFCK, and will be the basis for a range of products in conjunction with his backers such as the bike company Specialized. The chosen colour is green, reflecting Cavendish's other target in the Tour this year. \"The biggest goal for me every year is the green jersey. It really is what my whole year is built around,\" added Cavendish. While yellow is his immediate aim, over the three weeks he has no interest in the overall battle; asked how he saw Chris Froome's chances, he said simply, \"I couldn't give a toss about the people going for the yellow jersey.\" That is once Saturday's 218km between Porto Vecchio and Bastia is over, obviously. \u2022 This article was modified on 25 June 2013 to correct a mistake regarding the location of the opening stage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
