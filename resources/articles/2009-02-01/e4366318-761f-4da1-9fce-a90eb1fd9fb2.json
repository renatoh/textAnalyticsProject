The third and fourth-placed sides meet at Villa Park in Guus Hiddink's first match in charge of Chelsea, with Petrov suggesting that the Dutchman has inherited a team that no longer possesses the same unwavering belief that characterised their performances under Mourinho. \"When Mourinho was there they had a special team,\" said the Villa midfielder, recalling the back-to-back Premier League titles Chelsea won under the Portuguese in 2005 and 2006 and the winning mentality he instilled in his players. \"I think they had more belief in themselves. I don't think Chelsea are the team that they used to be under Mourinho. A lot of changes have happened there.\" Petrov's comments follow Sir Alex Ferguson's criticism of what he perceives to be a lack of patience at Stamford Bridge following the surprise dismissal of Luiz Felipe Scolari after just seven months in charge last week. Ferguson suggested that the decision to sack the Brazilian had \"played into the hands\" of United, although Petrov expects the change in manager to produce an immediate reaction at Villa Park as Chelsea look to regain some momentum in their push for silverware. \"They'll come here and be strong,\" said the Bulgarian international. \"They have a new manager and every new manager wants to start with a win, so we are expecting a hard game. They'll try to show that they can still be at the top but we'll try to show them that what we have achieved so far is not just because of luck but because we've been playing well.\" Petrov admitted that Villa, who are likely to have James Milner and Emile Heskey available again following injury, have a point to prove after their 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge in October. Villa had been tipped by many to provide a demonstration of their ability to challenge the top four, but Chelsea delivered arguably their best performance under Scolari. The ease with which victory was achieved provided O'Neill and his players with a reality check, and Villa's display that day has not been forgotten. \"That's the game we were really outplayed,\" admitted Petrov, whom O'Neill felt was one of Villa's more impressive performers in the 1-1 draw with CSKA Moscow in the Uefa Cup on Wednesday night. \"They were quicker and stronger than us and it's up to us to see if we take anything from that game. Will we learn from our mistakes? Are we going to be the same? We have got a lot of points to prove.\" The same might be said for Chelsea following a poor run of results that has allowed Manchester United to open up a cavernous 10-point gap over last season's runners up. Even more disconcertingly Villa have climbed above them into third place. Petrov, however, rejected Frank Lampard's suggestion that Chelsea can forget about the title if they lose at Villa. \"It's too early to say that,\" he said. \"There are three months to go, a lot of games to be played and a lot of teams can drop points.\" Not that the former Celtic player believes Villa are credible challengers this year. \"I don't think we're in the title race because other teams have been there for a long time and know what it needs to be champions,\" added the 29-year-old, who has put new contract talks on hold until the end of the season. \"We're just trying to break between them and show them that, in years to come, we can build up something and maybe one year we can challenge.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
