The restrictions have been imposed by primary care trusts covering Bury, Oldham and Heywood, Middleton and Rochdale in a bid to tackle budgetary problems. A leaflet explaining the changes to patients says: \"Carrying out operations that are not of great health benefit uses up resources that could be spent on really making a difference elsewhere. \"We know, for example, that one in five people who have a total knee replacement say a year later that they don't really feel it was a real benefit.\" The PCTs have drawn up a list of operations that they will not carry out. They also list others that will only be approved \"in exceptional circumstances\". The leaflet adds: \"For example, we won't generally carry out operations for mild varicose veins, breast augmentation, hair loss, tattoo removal, facelifts and other cosmetic surgery. \"Operations which will only be carried out in exceptional circumstances include: taking out tonsils, removing varicose veins that are causing severe problems, hysterectomies, fitting grommets, removing skin lesions, haemorrhoid surgery, wisdom teeth extraction, cataracts and joint replacements.\" Even operations with 80% success rates will be viewed \"of no clinical value\" and stopped. NHS staff now fear the cull of \"quality of life\" ops will become permanent and widespread across the country. Claire Norman, associate director of communications for Oldham PCT, said it could save \u00a37m by sticking to the new list of 57 restricted surgeries. \"It is not about cutting procedures, but about making sure that we spend finite NHS resources on the right people at the right time.\" The trusts, known jointly as the \"north- east sector\" of the NHS in Manchester, included the cuts as part of their 2010-11 financial recovery plan to the North West Strategic Health Authority. The axe will fall heavily on procedures to help with the knees and hips, gynaecology (including hysterectomies for heavy menstrual bleeding), eye cataracts and nearly all cosmetic surgery. The cuts will also affect procedures for hand and lower back pain, hernias, haemorrhoids, skin lesions, lower jaw and surgical dentistry. The trusts released a report last November ordering GPs and hospital departments across the region to stop commissioning from the list of 57 procedures. 'I was prepared to suffer - so I lost out' Tony Griffiths asked his GP for a knee replacement on the day his healthcare trust in Bury, Greater Manchester, introduced new, stringent rules. He was refused the operation on the NHS. In the end, the 68-year-old retired construction worker managed to get the operation on his medical insurance. His knee had deteriorated over three years, and Griffiths went to his GP on 1 October last year. \"I said, 'I need a new knee.' And he said, 'First and foremost, before we can refer you on the NHS, you have to fill out this questionnaire.' \"You had to score 20 or less, and I scored 26. There were questions like 'Can you do your own shopping?' I could drive to the supermarket, walk round for 20 minutes, then get back to the car. I would be struggling, but I was prepared to do it. So I couldn't say, 'No, I just sit at home and let somebody else do it.' And tThere were other questions like that. So, because I was prepared to put myself through a bit of pain, I lost out. Which is not right, is it? His condition was not life-threatening, but was having a severe impact on his life. \"I play golf, but unless the club had got a buggy for hire I couldn't play. I couldn't do a lot of gardening, or anything that involved bending my knee. Even sitting at a computer for an hour meant it was difficult to walk for a bit afterwards. \"I tried not to take pain killers, but certainly if I was going for a walk or shopping or playing golf I took them then because I knew what was coming\". \"So, \"I don't know how bad you've got to be before you can get it done on the NHS now.\" His GP referred him to a consultant privately. \"The consultant said, 'You need a new knee now.'\" And he had the operation seven weeks ago. \"What the NHS were saying was 'You'll have to put up with it',\" said Griffiths. \"I was fortunate. But other people in my situation are going to have to suffer until this embargo comes off.\" \"There was no chance of me getting it done on the NHS in that timescale. \"If I'd gone a month before there would have been no questionnaire, and I'm sure I would have got the appointment and got my knee done\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
