Parched front and backyards in regional towns across central and western parts of New South Wales are particularly under strain from the big dry, and could be pushed to the brink as councils clamp down on sprinkler use, ban the watering of lawns or mandate the use of only grey water for this purpose. Orange, Armidale and Tamworth have moved to stage four water restrictions in recent months. Tamworth\u2019s Chaffey Dam has dropped to a capacity of 24.2% and Armidale\u2019s Malpas Dam to 51% while at Orange, the combined storage of the Suma Park and Spring Creek dams is at 35.99%. The Tamworth mayor, Col Murray, says that if nothing changes, the town of 62,000 people will have about a year\u2019s supply of water left. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t rain, we\u2019ll inevitably go to level five restrictions. That will happen before Christmas,\u201d he says. Sue McLean, a former Tamworth nursery owner, says there are no green nature strips in town and a lot of plants that have been coping with the dry conditions are now succumbing to winter frost. \u201cPeople find it difficult in the winter time because although you may be able to bucket grey water, if it\u2019s already dark and cold when you get home from work, the last thing you want to do is go out and bucket water,\u201d she says. \u201cThe elderly can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s heartbreaking because they are house proud and keen gardeners.\u201d At her grandchildren\u2019s primary school, pupils have to eat their lunch inside because the playground has become too dusty. For the next couple of weeks, the school has arranged with the council for the children to be taken to a public park across the street to play on the grass. McLean says people in Tamworth had been \u201cscoffing\u201d when they read headlines in January that Sydney residents could be hit with a $40 increase in water bills. It\u2019s an insignificant amount, she says, when compared with price increases in regional areas. \u201cOnce upon a time it was government for everybody and you weren\u2019t crucified for living in a less urban area,\u201d she says. Almost two hours south at Murrurundi, water restrictions have been at level six since July last year. Residents have been asked to reduce their water consumption from an average of 166 litres per person per day to 140 litres. Upper Hunter shire councillor Josh Brown says people have been encouraged to have three-minute showers and reduce their washing-machine use to two loads a week. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a family of four, or five or six, that\u2019s pretty tough,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re having a bath or bathing your kids, you can have one 10cm deep bath per person per day.\u201d In January, the council started carting water to Murrurundi, which has a population of about 1,000. The bulk of its water supply comes from an emergency bore and the town is pinning hopes on a pipeline project to Scone next year. Walgett, west of Tamworth, has had to rely on bore water for drinking for almost 18 months after the rivers ran dry. Level five water restrictions started on Thursday, mandating that only grey water could be used for residential gardens, car washing and window cleaning. This week, the town\u2019s only supermarket burnt down, prompting the NSW agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, to tell state parliament the township \u201cis on its knees\u201d. Walgett shire deputy mayor Ian Woodcock says the mood in town \u201cis not very good\u201d. Drought conditions delayed the start of the local rugby league season because the ground was too dry. Tens of thousands of dollars have gone into re-grassing the football field, with a grant from the NRL. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t water it this year, we had to let most of it die,\u201d Woodcock says. \u201cWe\u2019ve started to water it again [with bore water] and it\u2019s starting to come good.\u201d Bathurst adopted stage three water restrictions last November and the council is considering more drastic measures in coming months, while Sydney-siders were hit with stage one water restrictions at the start of June. Garden Clubs of Australia president George Hoad, who frequently travels around NSW and interstate inspecting gardens, says climate change and drought will force a dramatic rethink of how Australians plan their garden. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve had a garden you\u2019ve created or it was your parents\u2019 and it\u2019s been there for 30, 40, 50, 60 years and suddenly there is no water to water those shrubs and trees and plants, and you have to watch them die one by one \u2013 it\u2019s like losing a child in some ways, it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t have the elaborate English gardens anymore \u2026 I love big English colourful borders, but they are just not practical. So my remedy is to slip across to the Chelsea Flower show every second year and visit some English gardens.\u201d Hoad began establishing his six-acre garden on the NSW\u2019s mid-north coast near Taree in 2005 and is reliant on water tanks and a half-full dam to keep it alive. \u201cI\u2019ve had to pull back a bit on more extravagant plantings of annuals, perennials, lots of colour, that\u2019s gone hand-in-hand with the drought over the past four or five years,\u201d he says. \u201cYou dig a hole and it\u2019s bone dry.\u201d Despite the gloomy climate outlook, he is amazed by the resilience of gardeners. \u201cAlways with a smile on their face, they say \u2018oh it might rain next week\u2019,\u201d he says. Water restrictions outside NSW aren\u2019t as tough. In Western Australia, there is a winter sprinkler ban in place for Perth, Mandurah and the state\u2019s south-west including Albany. Melbourne\u2019s water storage is at 49.9%, its lowest level since 2011 when the city was still recovering from the millennium drought. Melbourne Water says the downward trend in storage levels over the past five years reflects population-driven growth in demand and less water entering reservoirs. While Melbourne does not have water restrictions, there is a voluntary target for householders to reduce their consumption to 155 litres per person per day. The Victorian opposition wants a return to restrictions for the city but the state government has ruled that out for now. Instead, the Andrews government ordered in March for 125 gigalitres of water (or the equivalent of 55,500 Olympic swimming pools) for the 2019-20 financial year from the state\u2019s desalination plant. In Tasmania, a lack of significant rain and continuing dry conditions on King Island have resulted in TasWater extending level two water restrictions for Currie until 30 June. South Australia has permanent \u201cwater wise\u201d measures, which allow households to water gardens and lawns by hand at any time with a trigger nozzle hose, a watering can, bucket, or a drip-feed irrigation system. Sprinklers can be used for watering before 10am, or after 5pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
