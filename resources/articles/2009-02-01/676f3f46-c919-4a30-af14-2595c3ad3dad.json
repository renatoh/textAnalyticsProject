Eduardo's first-team comeback on Monday, a scoring return against Cardiff City, is now arrested for at least a fortnight by a hamstring injury picked up in that match. Having visited the striker in hospital after his surgery last February and relayed messages to him through Arsenal's liaison officer, Taylor said any meeting between the pair would have to be at the behest of Eduardo. \"I would never say never to something like that,\" he said. \"For me to just turn up would be an invasion of his privacy; he may not want that. If he wanted to meet up with us, then that would be fine, I'd love that. \"You feel the empathy side of it, where you wouldn't want to be in that situation. You know what it is like being injured as a footballer. It's horrible being injured for two weeks, never mind a year. There was no guilt at the time. I've had to continue my career and eradicate it from my mind when I go on the pitch.\" Taylor was delighted with the manner of Eduardo's comeback and hoped that the striker's brace of goals on Monday night, one of them a penalty, in a 4-0 victory would signal an end to the story, which began on 23 February last year when the defender was sent off during the 2-2 draw at St Andrew's after a tackle that shattered the Arsenal player's left ankle. \"It's a culmination of Eduardo's rehabilitation and he's done it, it could have been a sad week if the reports this week were he couldn't make it and he'd broken down,\" said Taylor. \"It's been a positive week for me and him especially.\" But the issue has once again been pushed to the fore this week when Eduardo said that he had had no contact from Taylor, a claim the centre\u2013half disputes. \"I went to see him on the Saturday evening in the hospital but he was still in surgery so I went back on the Sunday morning to see him then with Arsenal representatives, which was good because there's the language barrier there and he was recovering from the operation with drugs, so it was always going to be difficult.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
