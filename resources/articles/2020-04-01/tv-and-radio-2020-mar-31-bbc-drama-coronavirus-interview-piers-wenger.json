The government talks about abolishing the licence fee. Certain newspapers compete to haul the programme makers over the coals for various crimes, from \u201cwoke\u201d casting to \u201cmucking around\u201d with classics. There are rumours of declining ratings and mutterings about the muscle of Netflix and Amazon. Add to that a pandemic that has forced some of the corporation\u2019s biggest dramas \u2013 including Line of Duty and Peaky Blinders \u2013 to cease production and it would be no surprise to find Piers Wenger in a pessimistic mood. In fact, the opposite is true. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really mad time,\u201d says the head of BBC drama. \u201cBut it\u2019s also been inspiring in terms of the ingenuity creators, producers and casts are showing to get their shows on screen.\u201d He\u2019s been holding \u201cdaily calls to talk about the longer term impact this crisis will have on the kind of story audiences are most in need of\u201d. There have been talks, too, about how to protect the BBC\u2019s huge swath of freelance talent. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the day talking about how the BBC will support small and medium-sized production companies who will find the closedown particularly challenging \u2013 and how we work with established industry bodies to support freelancers, through a hardship fund or some other means. It\u2019s something we\u2019re taking seriously because, yes, people expect the BBC to do the right thing \u2013 and quite rightly, given the way we\u2019re funded.\u201d Wenger is clearly pleased with the swiftness of the corporation\u2019s wider response to the pandemic, from the extended news coverage to an array of educational, health and cultural programming, not to mention the decision to bring back old favourites such as Spooks to iPlayer. \u201cWe need to shape the output \u2013 whether you\u2019re school age, seeking escape, looking for drama at 9pm, or want a comedy that really makes you laugh and reflects the soul of the nation, like This Country.\u201d That said, it\u2019s clear the past few days have brought a sea change. When we first talked, pre-lockdown, Wenger stressed the importance of \u201cdrama for me\u201d, as he called it. \u201cNot me personally, but rather for particular demographics instead of a broad mainstream.\u201d This is theme close to the 47-year-old\u2019s heart. Since leaving Channel 4 as head of drama in 2016, he has worked hard to overhaul how the BBC commissions drama, shifting from the general to the specific, to fulfil \u201cbespoke\u201d viewer needs. \u201cIf you look at work we\u2019ve got coming up this year and compare it with what might have been commissioned for BBC One five or 10 years ago, you would see how we are making drama for a very diverse range,\u201d he said pre-virus. \u201cWe would never underestimate the power of communal viewing, but we have to be flexible in the terms of the way we platform our drama. I feel that our current slate is serving the whole population rather than just super-serving the heartlands.\u201d Speaking now, he admits to a different focus. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting to see the extent to which audiences are coming together to enjoy shows that have a really strong universal appeal. Whether it\u2019s The Repair Shop or Ant and Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway, I think people are taking great comfort from watching together, and knowing they are watching along with the rest of the nation \u2013 whereas up to now, the general trend was to seek out stories that were more bespoke. Audiences will continue to want those very particular pieces, but this period will also be a reminder of the sense of community that television can bring to the nation.\u201d So he\u2019s particularly pleased about two upcoming adaptations: David Nicholls\u2019 take on his bestselling marriage-in-crisis novel Us, starring Tom Hollander, Saskia Reeves and Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l; and Normal People, which tackles Sally Rooney\u2019s much-admired young-and-in-love second novel. \u201cUs might not be a super-tanker of a show, but it has a lot of heart and a lot to say about family. While Normal People is both a thrilling ride and incredibly emotionally honest. I think audiences will enjoy losing themselves in the lives of its protagonists.\u201d Not that he\u2019s back-pedalling his support of the year\u2019s most innovative dramas, including the sleek period crime thriller The Serpent; Michaela Coel\u2019s provocative contemporary drama January 22nd; and Small Axe, Steve McQueen\u2019s anthology series about black British history. Interestingly, all will air on BBC One. \u201cWhy should a voice like Michaela\u2019s be confined to the margins?\u201d Wenger says. \u201cStories like this and Small Axe haven\u2019t been given the big platform they deserve. We\u2019re looking to give the mainstream audience as much stimulation as we can. It makes sense to embrace the most diverse range of storytellers that we can. Having Michaela and Steve on BBC One in the same year is massive for the BBC.\u201d Is he concerned that the lockdown might lead to delays? \u201cWe\u2019re in the very early stages,\u201d he says. \u201cWith Small Axe, Steve has finished shooting and has been editing each episode. We are currently on course, although much will depend on how long the lockdown lasts. Steve has been incredibly pragmatic but there are also obviously things he\u2019s going to be incredibly rigorous about. So it\u2019s hard to say for sure, although the signs are positive.\u201d He is, however, prepared for a backlash when the shows do air. The recent adaptation of Malorie Blackman\u2019s best-selling young adult novel Noughts + Crosses, about a world where black people rule over white people, was called a \u201crecipe for division\u201d in the Daily Mail. Meanwhile, the casting of Vinette Robinson, who is black, as Mary Cratchit in A Christmas Carol led to predictable complaints. \u201cOh, the whole woke thing,\u201d says Wenger laughing. \u201cFor us not to choose Vinette Robinson, who was the best actress put up for that part, is like saying there weren\u2019t any black people in London in the 19th century, which is just historically inaccurate among other things.\u201d He pauses. \u201cSome people like work to be adapted in a quite conservative way. But, you know, we do that as well. The adaptations of A Suitable Boy [due later this year] and Normal People are extremely faithful to the text because they haven\u2019t been adapted before. There were complaints about A Christmas Carol and War of the Worlds but those stories had been adapted so many times. If we adapted them in their most faithful form, people might ask, \u2018Well, why bother?\u2019 It\u2019s not so much about being deliberately woke as about having a range of approaches.\u201d While the pandemic has put talk of cuts and threats to the licence fee on hold, are there still concerns? \u201cOf course. None of us can ignore the discourse around the BBC. For me, conversations about decriminalisation of licence fee non-payment and a subscription model for the BBC just point back in the direction of the importance of being a universal service. \u201cWe serve the heartland, but you have to think about young audiences and diverse audiences and audiences across the whole nation to justify the licence fee. Quite often when I\u2019m thinking about what to commission, I think who are the hardest people to convince? Which are the toughest nuts to crack? How can I give them a show that will be irresistible to them?\u201d Small Axe, a little-told history that speaks to an audience Wenger feels has been ignored, is crucial in this regard. The first episode of McQueen\u2019s anthology series focuses on the Mangrove Nine, a group of black activists who were tried in 1970 for inciting a riot; they had been protesting against police targeting the Mangrove Restaurant in Notting Hill, London, a gathering place for intellectuals and activists. \u201cIt gave me the same visceral thrill as Hunger. It\u2019s a defining piece of work from Steve McQueen, told with such purpose and drive and anger that you are stopped in your tracks.\u201d He hopes it will address the ongoing exodus of black British actors to America. \u201cThe more work like Small Axe, the more work like January 22nd, the more work like Noughts + Crosses, the more we send a positive message that they don\u2019t have to go. Clearly this has been an awfully long time coming. We\u2019ve got to sustain that supply line of work for a bond of trust to build up, so we hang on to that talent.\u201d This does not mean ignoring the BBC\u2019s other shows, though. There will still be room for Line of Duty to get viewers across the country wound up, as well as such quietly beautiful family dramas as The A Word and Last Tango in Halifax, not to mention state of the nation shockers such as Years and Years, and epics such as World on Fire. What about a show about a global pandemic? There\u2019s ahuge laugh. \u201cWell, never say never \u2013 though I have to say, a pandemic drama is not what I\u2019d want to watch when I turn on the TV this evening by any means. But if Russell T Davies phoned me tomorrow and had a completely brilliant genre-busting idea for one, I\u2019d find him very hard to turn down.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
