Thanks so much for all your comments on the blog over the last 12 million weeks. You\u2019ve been 110% committed, passionate and team players. All hail Valentino and goodnight! \u201cI want the cars, I want the girls and most of all I want the power,\u201d \u201cNo stopping, no toilet breaks.\u201d With that wisdom, Joseph will go far. At last, Charleine is a winner. Of the award for stating the bleedin\u2019 obvious. It\u2019s Lord Sugar\u2019s best bits. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t sell a bone to Battersea Dogs Home\u201d has to be a series highlight. The previous winners are in the house tonight, including the ever modest Mark Wright: \u201cYou\u2019re about to experience one of the best years you\u2019ll ever have.\u201d \u201cCan I throw my thought into the thought pot?\u201d Dan should have won for that line alone. There\u2019s a Mergim tribute going on. \u201cApply again,\u201d says Lord Sugar. \u201cIn 12 years.\u201d Joseph\u2019s mum and sister are in the audience. \u201cHe was very cheeky, but we always knew he was going to do well.\u201d \u201cI think it was an iconic moment,\u201d says Joseph about shaving off his \u2019tache. \u201cI did look a little second-hand car salesman-like.\u201d And it\u2019s a hit with the audience. It\u2019s Valentino\u2019s fashion evolution: braces, shades, that legendary moustache - there\u2019s nothing he can\u2019t wear. Reading Lord Sugar\u2019s book was Joseph\u2019s U-bend moment. \u201cI literally quit my job.\u201d Straight outta Peterborough, here comes the man of the moment: Joseph Valente. And is that a bit of a makeover he\u2019s had? Salad, talking about how utterly terrifying Claude is and now Ruth\u2019s even won an award for fishcakes. How much more of this can they string out? Just bring on the main man. Forget the Loser Cafe, where is Joseph? Oh Vana\u2019s one of those people who guesses your starsign. Are Vana\u2019s parents architects? Funny she hasn\u2019t mentioned it before. Vana\u2019s best bits: some pie, no cheese. At last, Jack Dee asks the question everyone was asking: Why did all the girls do their hair on the landing? It\u2019s all about the electrics. Now it\u2019s time to see how everyone\u2019s hair has changed with You\u2019re Hired. \u201cSince the day I was expelled from school I knew I was going to do something big with my life.\u201d Aw, Joseph is a worthy winner, isn\u2019t he? So Lord Sugar thinks Vana is \u201ca very clever lady\u201d. \u201cTechnology has been my best friend for over 50 years, so maybe it\u2019s time to make new friends.\u201d Yes! Joseph is HIRED&gt; This is more like it. Joseph\u2019s fighting to the end. \u201cI know you like technology.\u201d Decision time... \u201cYou\u2019ve seen how I\u2019ve managed people,\u201d says Vana. Like the most annoying person in the office? Now she\u2019s talking about pies. Mmmm... pies. \u201cWhat you see is what you get,\u201d says Joseph, before ticking off the \u201cdriven\u201d and \u201cpassionate\u201d cliches. Is Sugar veering towards Joseph? \u201cI think he\u2019s a fine fella.\u201d Claude has a warning: \u201cI think he\u2019ll need a watchful eye.\u201d Well from that, it sounds like he\u2019s got the advantage. Right, it\u2019s Karren and Claude conference time. \u201cI think Vana\u2019s really come into her own,\u201d says Claude. Karren thinks she\u2019s \u201ca double risk\u201d. If a man can make it in Peterborough, he can make it anywhere. Love Lord Sugar\u2019s face every time Vana mentions venture capitalists. Like a dog protecting a bone. \u201cI think you were wonderful manipulative in that conversation.\u201d Nothing gets past Claude, Vana. So Joseph got six or seven business cards. \u201cYou\u2019ve got more cheek than Kim Kardashian\u201d - it\u2019s a Lord Sugar zinger. What tonight\u2019s been missing is a good fight. Come on, Boardroom, you must deliver. \u201cPlumbing and heating has been around for hundreds of years and I think it\u2019s going to move into the future, into the space age of our human race,\u201d says Joseph. Try arguing with that, Lord Sugar. Brett\u2019s the best actor in this video. He\u2019d make a great plumber. Vana\u2019s presentation was cracking. Now Joseph\u2019s on, bringing his \u201cpersonable personality\u201d to the stage. \u201cThe doctor of desire\u201d will see you now. First to pitch: Vana, with her advert that looks nothing like a chatline promo at all. \u201cIt\u2019s like asking a bald man if he would use Charleine\u2019s hair salon.\u201d Vana: the relentless optimist. \u201cI want him to look inside me and see I\u2019m the right man.\u201d Joseph always delights. That Prime Time Plumbers advert looks like it should be in the local paper. Those boiler suits are fabulous though. \u201cThe other option is... you don\u2019t have another option.\u201d Good old Dicky. Who needs the internet when you have sandwich boards? \u201cThe warning signs are there for Vana.\u201d Claude is hitting the nail on the head quite a lot tonight, isn\u2019t he? Imagine getting networked by Joseph though. Joseph\u2019s having a last-minute change of direction. Renewable\u2019s over and now it\u2019s all about smart. These jugglers are a metaphor for what\u2019s going on in Vana\u2019s head. Oh no, it\u2019s her app. This looks nothing like the start of a porn film at all, does it? \u201cRuth can be a little wordy.\u201d And that\u2019s coming from Vana. Meanwhile, Brett can\u2019t wait to get in that boiler suit. Here comes Prime Time Plumbers: The Movie. Tonight\u2019s logos are brought to you by the \u201980s. \u201cThat\u2019s took three men three hours,\u201d says Brett. Don\u2019t hold back. Oh hang on, Elle isn\u2019t... Joseph needs to get that full stop off his logo. Literally can\u2019t look at it. Date Play doesn\u2019t sound dodgy at all, does it? Still it has \u201cbrain and science and everything behind it\u201d. Photoshoot fight! \u201cA few weeks ago I could have throttled him.\u201d That\u2019s Charleine\u2019s way of saying she can\u2019t stand the sexual tension, isn\u2019t it? \u201cWorking with Charleine is depressing at times\u201d Don\u2019t sit on the fence, Dicky. Enerpe... Enerpetie.. Ener... catchy name, Joseph. \u201cI don\u2019t really want too much fun.\u201d Go, Vana! Joseph\u2019s going to flog solar panels. Karren\u2019s basically saying he\u2019s picked the most rubbish contestants to help him. Impressed faces all round at the thought of Vana\u2019s gaming-meets-dating app. Tricky Dicky\u2019s already sketching phones that look like they\u2019re getting a little overexcited. Vana\u2019s got Tricky Dicky and Charleine - that\u2019s a strong line-up. Still, Joseph has Corporate G on his side. So the final showdown: Vana and Joseph are launching their businesses, with some \u201chelp\u201d. Cue: the return of the losers. This is like picking sports teams at school. \u201cI\u2019m here because I want to have an impact on the world. He\u2019s there because he wants to be a billionaire.\u201d Vana\u2019s warming up nicely tonight. Alan\u2019s finger is in full effect in this recap. Here we go, and if you had Lord Sugar\u2019s \u201csupply and demand\u201d line in your drinking game, you\u2019ll be sipping early. Hurry up, Murray, there are people here baying for Sugar. Come on, Sports Personality of the Year, get on with it. Oh, Andy Murray\u2019s won. Look at his happy little face. Hello and welcome to The Apprentice Final Liveblog. To quote the great prophets of pop known as the Spice Girls, tonight is the night when two become one. And all the losers are brought back to run around like headless, er, turkeys. Who will Lord Sugar hire? Plumber Joseph Valente describes himself as \u201cthe definition of success\u201d, but Vana Koutsomitis has gone and invented a new dating app that tickles his fancy. Joseph\u2019s probably grooming his mini-mo right now, while Vana\u2019s trying to cram even more words than usual into a sentence. Of course, that\u2019s not true because it\u2019s not live, but this blog will be at 9pm. So come on in and give 110% with your comments and laughs or it\u2019ll be like an event for the Piers Morgan fan club, with about two people turning up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
