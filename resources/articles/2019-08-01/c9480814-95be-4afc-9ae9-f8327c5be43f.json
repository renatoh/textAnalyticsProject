The younger generation agrees to support and look after their predecessors as they age. The older generation agrees to leave the world a better place for their offspring. But now, according to a new report, that bargain is under threat. Young Australians today face the prospect of being the first generation in living memory to be worse off than their parents, the Grattan Institute warns in its Generation Gap report. While Australian household wealth has nearly tripled over the past three decades, that growth hasn\u2019t reached everyone equally. \u201cHouseholds headed by someone aged 65-74 have an average equivalised net wealth of $1 million today, up from about $600,000 just 12 years ago. Meanwhile younger households have made barely any gains compared to a household of the same age 12 years ago,\u201d the report says. During that same period, poorer young Australians have seen a downward trend in their wealth. Rising house prices, high debt, stagnant wages and under-employment all threaten young people\u2019s ability to progress as much as their parents did. The report dismisses the stereotype of a millennial financial hedonism, finding that young people today are spending less on non-essential items than in the past. \u201cIf low wage growth and fewer working hours is the new normal in Australia, then we could have a generation emerge from young adulthood with lower incomes than the one before it at the same age,\u201d Grattan Institute\u2019s Danielle Wood warns. Such is already the case in the US and UK. What do young people think of their progress and prospects? Six young Australians share their stories. Arshdeep Cheema, 22, public health student, Melbourne I love the perception that young people are spending all their money on avocado breakfasts, because the majority of my girlfriends are some of the stingiest people you\u2019ll ever meet. Especially when you do come from a migrant background, you\u2019re very pushed to understand the value of money. So you grow up going, \u201cYeah, I have to save at every possible moment.\u201d Right now I\u2019ve got a budget spreadsheet. I make sure I count my savings, count any expenditure right down to a coffee. I think if anything we\u2019re very aware of what we spend our money on. But I think it comes down to the individual. I am sure it\u2019d be the exact same 20 or 30 years go. I migrated here when I was two from India, from Punjab. My parents\u2019 experience was very, very hard from what I know. My mum always tells me she never bought anything for herself. There was a fear we wouldn\u2019t have food on the table. I don\u2019t think we have that because we can always fall back on our parents. But I do think we don\u2019t have the same options as they had. Honestly, I don\u2019t see so much inequity, because the majority of the ageing population around me are still working in their 60s and 70s. I don\u2019t think they expect benefits. They feel they have to afford everything themselves. I think financial anxiety for young people is a very real thing. If we do choose to move out, we will be renting for a few years. There\u2019s really no stability, I\u2019m going to say that straight up. I think a lot of us feel there\u2019s never going to be complete independence from our parents because we\u2019re always going to be afraid of having to ask them for money at some point. Chloe Blancato, 21, commerce student and personal trainer, Sydney I work three to four jobs, and on top of that there\u2019s uni. Personal training is one of my main jobs. Babysitting would be five to 10 hours a week. The fitness for childcare job is around Sydney, driving to and from centres, so the days are full-on. But it\u2019s fun. I\u2019m happy with it. I\u2019d be working 26 to 30 hours a week. Uni is alright, but I\u2019m honestly just in and out. I just tend to stick to myself, focus on my studies. University life would just be another distraction for me. It\u2019s not too tiring. But I\u2019m switched on all the time. I\u2019m comfortable with where I\u2019m at. I\u2019m saving for holidays and I want to have enough money for a deposit on a unit in a few years. I only started saving about two years ago. But if I wasn\u2019t working all those jobs I\u2019d probably be stressed out. Both my parents have a really strong work ethic. I\u2019d say they\u2019re pretty well off today. They\u2019ve got investment properties and whatnot. We live comfortably. I still live with them. I wouldn\u2019t take that for granted. I don\u2019t want to be renting all my life. I see friends do it, and they\u2019re going to be doing it all their lives. Sydney is very, very expensive. It looks like its apartments for all of us. We\u2019re realistic with it. We\u2019ll be probably living way out west, not near the city, not near the beaches. But it\u2019s possible, I think. It\u2019s a lot of pressure on us, I feel. But that\u2019s life. You just have to go with it. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m happy about it. But I feel there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. Like, yeah, we would feel a little robbed \u2013 but what can you do? D\u2019el Murphy, 23, metalwork apprentice, Sydney Because I\u2019m still on an apprenticeship, I\u2019m not making an ideal amount. I don\u2019t have the ability to save a lot. I\u2019m living a little bit week to week. Things will change over time, hopefully. I think I\u2019m paid enough. I don\u2019t splurge too much. Being able to live with any amount of pay is all up to you and what you do with that amount of pay. I haven\u2019t really thought about buying a house, to be completely honest. It\u2019s never really come up for me. From looking at the news, it doesn\u2019t really look like I\u2019m going to be able to afford a place. Watching the reports, it\u2019s never really given me hope to think about it too much, like \u201cHey! Let\u2019s start saving for a house. Looking cheap at the moment.\u201d But my parents have never owned a house, so they\u2019ve never really had that. It\u2019s hard to really say whether or not I\u2019m doing better than my parents. There\u2019s a level of respect that we have to give older people. I\u2019d say courtesy. No one knows every single one of these old people, so to say that they\u2019re stealing our wealth is kind of ridiculous. But there is something weird about how things are going. There does need to be a conversation about whether we need changes so we can get the same chances. Crystal McKendrick, 27, policy professional, Brisbane On paper I look better off than my parents. That\u2019s because I\u2019ve come from a lower socio-economic background. I\u2019ve grown up in a regional town and my mum has been on welfare my whole life. I\u2019m technically multi-generational welfare. I don\u2019t have the two parent, white picket fence, middle income family background. I\u2019m now earning more money than both my parents combined. My mobility has improved. However, I\u2019m also in debt \u2013 which is something that wouldn\u2019t have happened many years ago. I\u2019m in debt before I begin because of my qualifications, because of trying to improve my life. So I\u2019m doing worse off in that regard. I\u2019ve grown up as an only child and I think about who\u2019s going to be looking after my parents in their old age when they don\u2019t have a decent income of their own. They don\u2019t have superannuation or a valuable property. They\u2019re in a rural, remote area, so at some point they\u2019re going to have to relocate to a more expensive location, and they may not be able to afford to do that themselves. That will probably come on to my shoulders. Given my background, to think about an expensive mortgage definitely makes me very worried that I can\u2019t afford to live in the city, which is where all the work is. The way that you improve your economic mobility is by having a job. Having a well-paid job. But the well-paid jobs aren\u2019t in the regional areas where housing affordability is a little bit better. I am quite scared about my future in some respects, but I\u2019m optimistic in some ways because I\u2019m seeing a trend towards people realising that you cannot have an economy without a society. People are starting to realise that at the heart of everything is people; I am seeing that governments at the policy end are trying to address these issues. George Fayad, 27, social worker, Sydney I\u2019m currently living with my parents. The main reason is because I would like to enter the property market by buying, rather than through a rental. The state of the property market makes that really difficult for someone just starting out, especially not having a partner or a lot of financial support from family. Maybe I was a little bit naive, but I thought I\u2019d finish uni, get a job and I\u2019d be out of home within a year. That was what I thought was going to happen. Obviously, the reality is so different. I have been saving since I was maybe 16 or 17. I remember when I opened my first term deposit, my return back then was actually a lot more than my return is now, even though I have a lot more money now. I think \u201coh my god, interest rates were so much higher\u201d. There\u2019s irony everywhere. Obviously, the more I earn the more I get taxed. I have Hecs, and the threshold has just lowered for repaying Hecs debts, so even though I\u2019m earning the most I\u2019ve ever earned as an adult, I\u2019m also getting taxed more than ever before. When my parents moved here from Lebanon it was a lot different. I wouldn\u2019t even say they \u201cstruggled\u201d to buy a home, to be honest. They definitely had a lot more opportunity when they came over to establish themselves in the property market. I think a lot of people in their generation have done exactly that. Because now our generation is renting property owned by their generation. In 50 years we\u2019re going to be the old people. And we need to start setting ourselves up for that now. If we\u2019re looking at it and seeing there\u2019s a problem that all these younger people are struggling, we need to make sure in 50 years they\u2019re not worse off. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be happening. Amabel Grinter, 23, dairy farmer, Cobram, Victoria I work on my family\u2019s dairy farm. It\u2019s really the animals that I enjoy the most. There\u2019s a lot of negativity in regard to animal welfare, and I feel that if I\u2019m part of the industry and I\u2019m looking after my animals the best I can, I can make a difference. I\u2019ve been out of uni for 18 months and within those 18 months things have just got tougher and tougher for the dairy industry. Especially in our area with water security being a really massive issue. We\u2019re looking into the future and wondering if there\u2019s going to be a dairy industry in our area in 10 years\u2019 time. I would be a fourth generation dairy farmer, but the farm that my parents are on is first generation. It wasn\u2019t handed down to them or anything. They worked to get that farm themselves. The end goal of owning your own farm, I think most people would still see that as a possibility \u2013 it\u2019s just about what age you get to that point, and how large the farm is you\u2019re able to purchase. I\u2019m finding it really hard. Every day I\u2019m finding people are less and less optimistic within that older generation and that makes it really hard for young people coming through to have positivity towards it. I\u2019m still really passionate about the industry and think there\u2019s really a lot of good being done in it. But from a leadership view it\u2019s hard to find the optimism. That\u2019s probably the hardest thing at the moment. There\u2019s people in the older generation who are struggling as well. Older people who do have money have worked hard all their life to be in a situation where they can have that. I think where tax change needs to happen is probably more in addressing how the system is skewed to help large businesses. Rather than attack a generation, I think it needs to be based on income \u2013 because they\u2019re some young people who are doing bloody well, as well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
