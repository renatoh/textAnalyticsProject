Guardian.co.uk was named digital news service of the year, with the judges describing the site's WikiLeaks coverage as \"a jaw-dropper\". \"Guardian.co.uk is constantly raising the bar by which other news-oriented websites are judged,\" they said. The Guardian Datablog, which publishes raw data and graphic visualisations of the news, won the category for best use of new media. The judges praised \"the interactive information, and comprehensive, in-depth content\" as \"head and shoulders above the competition\".
