Instead he focused on his forwards, a much-maligned bunch in recent, fallow years. Davies is regarded as one of the more cerebral coaches around but, when asked about the try scored by James Simpson-Daniel as Gloucester finally took charge of a match which saw the lead change hands five times and end 40-31, he preferred to reflect on his pack's dominance up front and one driving maul that rolled on for 30 metres. \"I am delighted with the way the pack has gone in the opening two games,\" said Davies. \"Our scrum was fantastic and we dominated the lineout. We have the forwards who can help us kick on. London Irish were impressive behind and we needed to give everything we had to win.\" Two of Gloucester's three tries were scored by forwards. The England No8 Ben Morgan supplied the first, beating four defenders on a 20-metre run to claim his first points for the club he supported as a boy since his summer move from the Scarlets. \"I am loving life here,\" said Morgan, who is in only his second season on a senior contract. \"Having Nigel as the head coach helps because he knows my game from the Scarlets and how to get the best out of me. I am getting marked more now but I like to be challenged: looking at ways to improve helps you develop.\" Morgan believes that the relegation factor makes the Premiership distinct from the RaboDirect Pro 12. \"There is more heat about games in England,\" he said. \"I could have stayed in Wales for another year but I wanted to be in the shop window for England and it was the right time to move.\" The London Irish No8 Jon Fisher was also prominent but it was in the midfield where the home side had the advantage. Sailosi Tagicakibau and Jonathan Joseph created space at will but their forwards continually infringed at the breakdown to turn attack into points for the opposition. Freddie Burns kicked seven penalties for Gloucester and late tackles by Billy Twelvetrees and Dan Murphy ensured that the Premiership is propped up at the end of round two by the two Exiles, Irish and Welsh."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
