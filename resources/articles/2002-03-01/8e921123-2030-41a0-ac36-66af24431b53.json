And to prove it, we're launching a new competition using an idea that had never been thought of before we just came up with it. Allow us to explain how it works. When the mood takes us, we'll stick up a footballing picture that looks like it might have a story behind it. Today's snap features every fan's favourite coach Brian Kidd with every fan's favourite manager David O'Leary. All you have to do is think up an appropriately comic caption and email it in to us. Send in your Kidd/O'Leary captions to the football.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk and we'll print the best. You never know, we may even come up with some prizes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
