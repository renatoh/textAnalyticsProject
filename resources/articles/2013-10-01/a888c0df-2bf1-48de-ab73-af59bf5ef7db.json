Australian television's Nine Network confirmed on its website on Wednesday night that negotiations with the technology's Australian inventor, Warren Brennan, had broken down. It follows a mixed performance by Hot Spot, which was part of the decision-review system used during the Ashes series in England in the summer. During that series Brennan suggested that issues with accuracy may have been caused by the use of silicone tape on bats. When the various controversies were raging \u2013 notably over Jonathan Trott's lbw dismissal at Trent Bridge and those of Kevin Pietersen and Usman Khawaja at Old Trafford \u2013 there had been suggestions that new and more advanced technology developed by Brennan, known as Real Time Snicko, might be used in Australia. DRS came under heavy criticism from both sides in England, where the home side won the series 3-0. The International Cricket Council announced last month it had formed a working group to consider how to improve the system. The technology costs about \u00a3160,000 for a Test series. \"It's their decision and that's what's been communicated to us,\" Fairfax Media quoted Brennan as saying. \"As far as I'm concerned, it is final.\" The development leaves the ball-tracking component, Eagle Eye, audio evidence picked up by stump microphones and slow-motion replays as the remaining tools at the disposal of the third official in the Ashes. Assessments are ongoing before an ICC meeting this month, and Nine is to trial ultra-motion split-screen technology in its Ashes coverage. That will also be monitored by the ICC as a potential addition to DRS. Brennan said he had been informed of the decision by Nine but laid the blame squarely with Cricket Australia, for refusing to contribute more towards the cost after doing a huge new television deal with the network in June.We're just moving on with things. Channel Nine have got a new deal with Cricket Australia, which I know has cost them a lot more money. I gather there had to be some restructuring of costs. \"I don't have a beef with Channel Nine. The disappointing thing for us is that Cricket Australia didn't engage at all with us to try and come on board and help with this situation. They just said: 'No, it's got nothing to do with us. It's Channel Nine's responsibility.' \"What's disappointing is we work in four countries at the moment \u2013 well, until recently. Cricket Australia is the only body that doesn't contribute to our costs for the DRS components. New Zealand contribute directly to us, the ECB [England and Wales Cricket Board] contribute and also South Africa. \"My only beef is with Cricket Australia because we tried to engage with them several weeks ago and they refused. We need to continue to invest and improve the product so that everybody thinks it's getting better. If bodies like Cricket Australia won't come on board and contribute to that, there's not really any point in us continuing.\" A Cricket Australia spokesman was quoted as saying: \"We don't think it's appropriate to comment on discussions between Nine and one of its partners. Sky is expected to retain Hot Spot for next summer's home Tests against India and Sri Lanka."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
