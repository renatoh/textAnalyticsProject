The loggers are crossing the border from Peru and mainly extracting cedar from territories used by indigenous peoples living in \u201cisolation\u201d, according to the NGOs. The report focuses on a reconnaissance trip made in May which documented illegal logging in the park, as well as \u201cmassive\u201d commercial hunting and the abandonment of premises supposedly run by the Environment Ministry and military. The trip was made, the report states, after several government visits to the region in recent years which confirmed that illegal loggers and hunters were operating, but led to almost no action being taken to stop them. On one occasion illegal wood was confiscated, but it was recovered by Peruvian loggers, it is claimed, in a \u201cpossible violent attack against [an Ecuadorian] military post.\u201d The report, written by the Fundaci\u00f3n Alejandro Labaka, Acci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica and Land is Life, acknowledges that illegal logging has been a problem for years in Yasun\u00ed, but states that now it is \u201cintensifying\u201d - and made worse by oil operations to the north. The fears are numerous: violent raids, revenge killings, kidnappings, fatal epidemics, dependency. Here Land is Life\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Proa\u00f1o, during a visit to Peru, tells the Guardian what is going on: DH: Are you able to estimate the number of loggers or logging camps in Yasun\u00ed? JP: We\u2019ve located around 20 places where loggers are currently operating. I can\u2019t tell you the exact number of camps as such. Some are very big - where they keep their provisions, their petrol, their equipment - whereas others are smaller, more improvised, in the areas where they are cutting cedar. DH: Where in the park? JP: In the far east right on the border with Peru. The exact locations are the River Nashi\u00f1o, which births in Ecuador and crosses into Peru and meets the River Napo, as well as the River Lobo, and - this is what has surprised us the most - the River Curaray. This is a very wide river, easy to navigate. There used to be at least three [Ecuadorian] military posts there, and among their responsibilities was keeping watch on the river. What surprised us is that the loggers have come upriver and established their camps along the banks. DH: A basic question, but I must ask it. Is logging prohibited in national parks in Ecuador? JP: Definitely. And even more so in the Tagaeri Taromenane Intangible Zone [TTIZ, a 758,000 hectare area inside the park and Waroani territory where the loggers are reported to be operating]. . . This has a very special category of protection. Not only is it protected like all national parks, but also by two articles in the Constitution. . . [one of which], Article 57, states that all territories inhabited by indigenous peoples in isolation should be intangible. [The TTIZ] was established in 1999, but this has given rise to a situation that, from my perspective, is very concerning. It is that the idea of protecting indigenous peoples in isolation has always been seen from an environmental point of view. That\u2019s to say: \u201cIf we\u2019re protecting the national park, then immediately, automatically, we\u2019re protecting the indigenous peoples in isolation.\u201d That\u2019s a serious error. They have human rights guaranteed in the Constitution and now internationally. They\u2019re not part of the park\u2019s fauna. DH: Another basic question, but I must also ask it. How do you know the loggers are there? What\u2019s the evidence? JP: The evidence dates from 2015 when during overflights we saw- DH: Have you participated in the overflights? JP: Yes, I\u2019ve been on various overflights. We\u2019ve seen [the loggers]. We have photos and GPS coordinates. We began to see they\u2019re opening up paths, very close to the border. Later, the authorities made various visits to the region and confirmed that it is illegal logging. DH: Who are the loggers? JP: They\u2019re coming upriver from Peru. If you were to arrive at the border, you\u2019d see that the Peruvian side in particular has been seriously impacted by logging. Seriously impacted. . . but only on the Peruvian side, where there are various valuable species. On the Ecuadorian side the focus has been on cedar - two types of cedar. DH: That was my next question: the species they\u2019re after. Cedar above all? JP: On the Ecuadorian side, cedar in particular. Two types. But they\u2019re also doing a lot of hunting. Hunting is banned in [the TTIZ] too. They\u2019re even hunting various threatened species, like armadillos. You can see the remains. Tortoises. And they\u2019ve built various stations to smoke the meat. DH: The people doing the hunting. . . Same as the loggers, or others? JP: They work together. We don\u2019t know if there are teams specifically dedicated to hunting and others dedicated to logging, or if they\u2019re the same. We don\u2019t have those details yet. DH: And the smoked meat. . . That also leaves for Peru? JP: Definitely. And it seems that, given the size of the stations they\u2019ve built to do the smoking, it\u2019s not a subsistence activity. That\u2019s to say, they\u2019re not hunting to feed themselves. It appears that this is commercial. Members of the indigenous communities [in the region] say, \u201cWell, this is what you do if you want to sell it.\u201d We\u2019ve found spent cartridges and rubbish they\u2019ve left behind, and they\u2019re all products of Peruvian origin. DH: A group of you recently entered the region, right? JP: We began to see [evidence of the logging] in 2015. Immediately we informed the authorities. Later, members of the [indigenous] communities along the Curaray spoke with researchers like myself as well as the authorities - those in charge of protecting the area, the park guards - and told them that there are outsiders logging in the park. The response by the government was inefficient or ineffective. DH: What has it done? JP: It appears that they\u2019ve entered the region three or four times and confirmed what is happening - so the government knows that outsiders are in territories used by indigenous peoples in isolation. . . We spoke to others living in the region, including the Waoranis in the [TTIZ], and it was decided, together, to make a reconnaissance trip. Acci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica, Land is Life and the Fundaci\u00f3n Alejandro Labaka joined forces. It was agreed we would enter via the River Shiripuno. . . Groups from different indigenous nations participated too. DH: In the trip? JP: Yes. Waoranis, Kichwas from Sarayacu, Zaparas, Kichwas from the region, and settlers too. . . We don\u2019t know if the Taromenanes [one of the indigenous groups in \u201cisolation\u201d] will respond like they have in the past - with attacks, violence - to defend their territories. Rather than attack the loggers, they might attack local people, particularly if they take part [in the logging], as has happened in the past. That\u2019s very possible. Due to how abandoned the region is. The state has almost no presence there. There are no economic opportunities for local people. . . [and so] the only economic opportunity right now in the Curaray region is illegal logging. We\u2019re concerned that the communities could become involved. DH: Do you think it\u2019s possible some people [in the region] are working for the loggers coming from Peru? They\u2019re the ones who know the forest best. Or is there no evidence? JP: There isn\u2019t any evidence for that yet, but that\u2019s what happened in the past. . . Something that we do know is that the military know the loggers and what they\u2019re doing, but haven\u2019t taken the necessary measures in response. I don\u2019t know if this is because of a lack of control, or lack of superiors. The military is abandoned too. There are just two or three posts protecting an enormous border. And the loggers are giving the military food and drink. There\u2019s a kind of co-existence. DH: You mentioned the Taromenanes earlier. What\u2019s the main danger for them? What is your main concern about loggers invading this part of the park? JP: Years ago, in the early 2000s, numerous loggers installed themselves at the other end of the park, near the oil roads, and there were various violent encounters. Loggers were speared by the Taromenanes - we don\u2019t know exactly what violence the loggers might have done to them. In 2003 it wasn\u2019t loggers directly, but they were involved in fomenting the Waoranis to attack the Taromenanes, and about 20 were killed. Today we know that there are indigenous peoples in isolation less than 20 kms from where the loggers are. In recent years the Taromenanes have shown they\u2019re capable of attacking more than 40 kms away from their homes and gardens. . . I imagine the Taromenanes are very concerned [about the loggers], particularly because of the noise the chainsaws make and the pressure on resources. The hunting is intensive and commercial. [And these are] the resources the Taromenanes depend on. DH: Are the Taromenanes the only group in \u201cisolation\u201d in this part of the park or are there others? The Tagaeris? JP: I can\u2019t tell you if the group [closest to the border] is currently directly connected to the Waoranis or if it\u2019s a group that separated from them many years ago. . . They could be [Taromenanes]. We\u2019ll have to keep on trying to identify who they are. DH: So when you\u2019re talking about the possible impacts of loggers on indigenous peoples in \u201cisolation\u201d in this part of the park, there is both this [unidentified] group near the border and the Taromenanes? JP: Yes. DH: And have you heard of any contact between them and the loggers? JP: Not with the loggers, but yes with the communities along the Curaray. DH: Recently? JP: We\u2019ve been documenting the presence of isolated peoples [in this region] for the last few years. The military have reports of naked people approaching their camps. There are testimonies across the entire Curaray basin. DH: And there\u2019s another danger of contact: the Taromenanes and others are very vulnerable to diseases. Right? JP: Definitely. That\u2019s the biggest concern with the stuff left by the loggers. The rubbish. They leave clothes, shoes, plastic, food. . . These are all vectors of new diseases for the Taromenanes. DH: Have you seen the wood coming down the River Curaray? How is it transported? JP: Floating. With big boats. They come upriver from Peru. The tree trunks are tied to them. They don\u2019t put the trunks in the boats. DH: What are you requesting from the government - and maybe from Peru\u2019s government too? JP: In political terms: that the intangibility of the [TTIZ] and the human rights of the indigenous people in isolation and local communities are respected. In practical terms: that the logging and hunting stops. In order to do this, we\u2019re preparing a formal complaint to the public prosecutors\u2019 office. . . [saying that] illegal loggers are operating at these coordinates and these are the rights being violated, not only because it\u2019s a national park, but because of the people living there. There must be better control along the border. And it must be permanent control. It\u2019s no good going in once and removing and detaining the loggers, and then no one goes back in. And the protocols for protecting the Taromenanes must be respected. We can\u2019t think of sending in the military to remove the loggers. This is territory inhabited by indigenous peoples in isolation. [We also believe there must be] more attention paid to the Waorani and Kichwa communities in the region. Other economic opportunities for them must be identified. DH: What are the communities\u2019 main concerns? What do they think about the loggers? JP: There are several concerns. The first is that the loggers are operating illegally and exploiting resources that the communities - both the Waoranis and Kichwas - consider within their territories. Second, they\u2019re scared of the Taromenanes\u2019 possible reaction. This is another request to the authorities: that the security of the communities is guaranteed. DH: Are you going to make any requests to Peru\u2019s government too? JP: We haven\u2019t considered that yet. We need more information. Where\u2019s this timber being commercialised? How are they operating? It doesn\u2019t seem that the people doing the logging are the owners of the wood. They\u2019re sub-contracted. The loggers themselves are mainly indigenous. DH: The loggers are indigenous Peruvians? JP: Yes. But they\u2019re very poor too. They have few economic alternatives and, in many cases, they\u2019re effectively forced to do this kind of work. We\u2019re not trying to take to court - let\u2019s say - the most vulnerable people in the supply-chain. That\u2019s why it would be good to understand how the business functions. Who provides the petrol? Who buys the meat? Who owns the boats? What kind of weapons do they have? . . . We\u2019re going to try and stop the wood coming out, but respectfully - not with some violent incursion by the military declaring war on the loggers. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right way to operate in indigenous territory. It has to be an exercise in which the communities participate fully. . . and about which they are consulted. It can\u2019t be just the military removing one or two loggers and establishing a post. That would further risk contact with the Taromenanes. It has to be well-thought-out and well-planned. DH: Are you sure the loggers are Peruvian? JP: Yes. DH: Jos\u00e9, thank you. JP: Thank you. Ecuador\u2019s Environment Ministry could not be reached for comment, but yesterday issued a statement saying that protecting indigenous peoples in \u201cisolation\u201d is a priority for the government. According to the statement, the Environment Ministry has just signed a five year agreement with two other ministries to develop an \u201cAction Plan.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve said that part of our policy will be controlling the traffic of wildlife and wood in the Intangible Zone [in the Yasun\u00ed National Park],\u201d says Environment Minister Tarsicio Granizo in the statement. \u201cThis [agreement] is a continuation of state policy that the government has been implementing over the last few years.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
