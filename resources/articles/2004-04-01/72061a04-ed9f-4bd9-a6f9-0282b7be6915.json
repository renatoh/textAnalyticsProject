They are struggling to beat the dreaded drop, but it seems they cannot avoid it. A cacophony of jeers greeted this latest defeat. The reaction of the fans is understandable. Yet again their team did not deserve to lose, but Leicester seem to have been blowing matches all season. Two cruel goals from Fulham substitute Collins John condemned the Foxes to their 11th consecutive home game without a win and, with relegation rivals Leeds winning, the situation looks pretty glum. 'Glum? Who's glum?' asked Leicester manager Micky Adams, spikily. 'We're only three points off safety.' He needs to work on the accent, otherwise the Mohammed Al Sahhaf impression is spot on. Adams' opposite number, Chris Coleman, was more realistic. 'It's just not going for Leicester at the minute and we had a little bit of luck today,' he said. In truth, Leicester should and could have won. Paul Dickov, who thrives in these fight-for-your-lives situations, was twice denied a second-half goal; once by the crossbar and once by Edwin van der Sar, who dwarfed the diminutive Scot and pulled off a fine save. Muzzy Izzet, another tireless campaigner, came even closer to scoring. Van der Sar drops his goalkicks rather than takes them out of hand. Izzet pounced on one as the ball bounced, and hooked it into an empty net. The 'goal' was disallowed, apparently for a foul on the keeper. On such incidents is relegation decided. Of course, as fate would dictate, Fulham went straight down the other end and stole a goal. John, a Liberia-born 18- year-old, scored his first for the club with his first touch of the game after coming on for Barry Hayles, flicking the ball deftly over the exposed Ian Walker. Leicester heads never dropped, but as they poured forward in search of a late equaliser, they left themselves exposed at the back. John put another nail in Leicester's coffin when he side-footed home his and Fulham's second goal a minute from time. Looking at Leicester's run-in, or rather limp-in, this was one they had to win. They still have to feature in dogfights against fellow strays Blackburn, Manchester City and Portsmouth. Oh, and there's the small matter of Manchester United and Arsenal too, at Old Trafford and Highbury respectively.
