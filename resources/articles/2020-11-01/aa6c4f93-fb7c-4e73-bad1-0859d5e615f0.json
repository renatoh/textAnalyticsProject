Twenty minutes later, a fire alarm went off in the cathedral. The building was evacuated and, another 20 minutes later, a fire was discovered spreading through la for\u00eat \u2013 the forest of rafters made from 1,400 trees that hold up the massive leaded roof of the 800-year-old gothic glory. The race was on to save the storied structure and the treasures therein. The Night Notre Dame Burned (BBC Four) tells the story of the 12 infernal hours that followed. Just about every firefighter in Paris descended on the cathedral to do battle with a fire that had already taken hold firmly, as people gathered in their hundreds and thousands in the streets around to watch and pray. It is an admirably structured film, spreading and carrying the weight of abundant material. This was gathered scrupulously from the firefighters who faced the flames \u2013 and whose narrative drives the film \u2013 as well as from the people on the ground, including commanders directing operations, the cathedral\u2019s priests, bureaucrats, curators and volunteers who came to contribute what they could. It was the first proper call-out for Marie-Ange, a young firefighter. All the previous ones had been false alarms. Soon she was following her chief up a medieval spiral staircase, past gargoyles that appeared to be vomiting molten lead as the roof melted, and refusing to confess to any misgivings about the extraordinary heat building up until the chief turned round and said they could not get any nearer. \u201cWe looked at each other and our helmets had changed colour\u201d \u2013 a sign that their gear was close to failing. \u201cIt was too hot,\u201d she remembers. Interleaved with the testimonies are stretches of footage recorded at the time, snippets of news bulletins that kept the world updated on Our Lady of Paris\u2019s apparently unstoppable immolation and drawings by the fire station\u2019s sketch artist. (I do not know if a fire station having a sketch artist is a sound evidential practice we should adopt, or simply the most French thing you ever did see.) We see film of the first sparks and embers as they began to fall through the roof into the nave, like inverted fireworks, and the cathedral spire glowing orange from within against the night sky just before it fell \u2013 as breathtakingly beautiful as it was ruinous. Witnesses\u2019 language is often as cinematic. One firefighter describes emerging from a staircase: \u201cAnd we see the monster arriving \u2026 with its mouth open, coming to swallow the roof whole.\u201d Another reveals that they call a certain type of flame \u201cdancing angels\u201d. Up on the roof, in a quiet moment, the embattled brigade hears the crowds encircling the cathedral singing hymns. \u201cFrom 300ft [90 metres] above, they sound as if they are coming from the heavens.\u201d Yet, whenever things threaten to get too romantic or abstract, we are recalled to the danger and scale of the event by a sudden twist towards practicality (\u201cWe were hugging the walls because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s above our heads\u201d) , or uncompromising fact, as worst-case scenarios \u2013 including one of the bell towers catching fire, which could bring down the whole building \u2013 come to pass. This is a film that makes you long for several spin-offs. I would like a whole hour on the cell within the sacristy that contains nothing but cupboards full of keys, and keys to other cupboards full of keys, to all the secret parts of the cathedral. I would like an eight-part drama on the ineffably dislikable rector of Notre Dame, Monsignor Patrick Chauvet, and the barely concealed irritation of Gen Jean-Claude Gallet, the head of the fire brigade, towards him. And, of course, I would like a sequel about the reconstruction \u2013 so thank you to the documentary on exactly that that followed the film. Because \u2013 did I not say? \u2013 they beat the monster. The firefighters returned to the station 12 hours after they had left and started to clean their equipment all over again. By 8am, they were ready for inspection. Notre Dame was still standing. Bravo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
