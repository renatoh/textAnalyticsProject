Boris Cule rushes to the front of the queue to get his answer in first. \u201cHaving looked at the list of countries that produced Premier League winners, the obvious candidates seemed Liberia, Latvia and Iceland,\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd, indeed, Iceland were ranked 95th in the world when Eidur Gudjohnsen won the title with Chelsea in 2005, and were ranked 97th when he repeated the feat in 2006. Liberia were ranked 98th when Christopher Wreh won the title with Arsenal in 1998, but Latvia were ranked 105th when Igors Stepanovs won it with Arsenal in 2002. \u201cThat seemed to be the end of it, as further search (Jamaica, Algeria, Trinidad and Tobago, etc) yielded no results, until, to my surprise, up popped the surprising winner in Jonny Evans, who won the title in 2013 with Manchester United at a time when Northern Ireland were ranked 119th in the world. What makes this even more remarkable is that Northern Ireland were ranked 97th just a month earlier, and were ranked 27th when Evans won his first title in 2009. Northern Ireland were ranked 111th when Roy Carroll won the title with Manchester United in 2003, putting him in second place behind Evans.\u201d Ian Cade has come up with a list of players based on the Fifa rankings of the national team they played for at the end of the year in which they won the title, rather than in May. This would put Carroll top: Roy Carroll: Manchester United, 2003, Northern Ireland, 122 Ryan Giggs: Manchester United, 2000, Wales, 109 Christopher Wreh: Arsenal, 1998, Liberia, 108 Giggs: Manchester United, 1997, Wales, 102 Giggs: Manchester United, 2001, Wales, 100 Giggs: Manchester United, 1999, Wales, 98 Eidur Gudjohnsen: Chelsea, 2005, Iceland, 94 Gudjohnsen: Chelsea, 2004, Iceland, 93 Johnny Evans: Manchester United, 2013, Northern Ireland, 89 We\u2019re minded to go with the ranking at the moment the team was crowned Premier League champions, but the above list does show that Manchester United have been a fruitful home for low-ranked internationals. Tom Aldous got in touch with a player who would have beaten Evans, Carroll et al had he made 10 appearances for Leicester in the season he arrived. \u201cFaiq Bolkiah joined in March 2016 so he was part of the squad when they won the title,\u201d writes Tom. \u201cFaiq is from Brunei, who were ranked 190th at the time, but he didn\u2019t play a single minute for them in the league.\u201d He doesn\u2019t count then, alas. Sorry. Random guests at footballers\u2019 weddings (2) Following on from unlikely guests at players\u2019 weddings, here are some we missed \u2026 \u201cThe one and only Nelson Mandela attended former Charlton Athletic striker Shaun Bartlett\u2019s wedding,\u201d writes Nicholas Walmsley. Here\u2019s the story. \u201cGylfi Sigurdsson got married at Lake Como last week, with royal wedding-like coverage in the Icelandic media,\u201d notes Svein Sig\u00fe\u00f3rsson. \u201cFor some reason, Julie Benz, an actress most famous for playing Dexter\u2019s wife in the serial killer TV series, made an appearance there, alongside various teammates from the national team and some close friends from former club sides. I still have no idea why she was there.\u201d Benz\u2019s other half is Rich Orosco, who works for LAFC. Meanwhile, Noel Baker \u201cfeels compelled to highlight an inaccuracy in your otherwise great piece, if only to protect the enduring reputation of AC/DC. As reported in Marca, Sergio Ramos didn\u2019t manage to bag the genius Antipodean rockers, and instead had to make do with Europe.\u201d Captains with roles reversed \u201cAre there any instances of two players who are teammates for club and country where one is captain of their club but the other is captain of their country?\u201d asks James Robinson. Indeed they have, James \u2013 and it\u2019s over to Italy for the answer. \u201cFabio Cannavaro became of the captain of Italy regularly from 2002 and he famously lifted the world cup as the skipper for Italy when they won the tournament in 2006,\u201d writes Rit Nanda. However, during this period, particularly from 2004-06, when he played for Juventus, he played under the captaincy of Alessandro Del Piero. So, from 2004 to 2006, Del Piero captained Cannavaro at club level with Juventus and vice versa at the international level with Italy. Knowledge archive \u201cFormer Serbian midfielder Vladimir Jugovic played for, among other clubs, Red Star Belgrade, Sampdoria, Juventus, Lazio and Inter,\u201d so said Bogdan Kotarlic in November 2012. \u201cIt enabled him to participate in no fewer than five derby matches where the teams from the same city were involved. Has any other player taken part in more derbies?\u201d The popular pub quiz answer is that German hair model Christian Ziege also played five derbies, appearing for Liverpool against Everton, Milan against Inter, Bayern Munich against TSV 1860, Tottenham against Arsenal and Middlesbrough against Newcastle and Sunderland. We have also read somewhere that Ray Wilkins played in five: west London, Manchester, Milan, Glasgow and Edinburgh, after coming off the bench for Hibs a few days before moving to Millwall. But two players have gone one better: Richard Gough has six derbies to his name, including Dundee, north London, Glasgow, Forest v Derby, the Merseyside set-to and San Jos\u00e9 Clash versus LA Galaxy. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching Big Brother,\u201d Gough said of the Old Firm matches in March 2011. \u201cThe product is not great at the minute but you know there is going to be an accident happening.\u201d The other is Paul Stewart (Spurs v Arsenal, Liverpool v Everton, Crystal Palace v Millwall, Wolves v West Brom, Sunderland v Newcastle and Stoke v Port Vale). Contrary to popular opinion, he never played in the Manchester derby. \u2022 For thousands more questions and answers look through our archive.

Is this the best overall European record for a club that has never won a major competition?\u201d \u2022 Email your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
