In 1939, it can seem, Britain was still a nation of villages, and once those villages had been emptied of their enlisted men, they became the province of matronly gossips, flighty young mothers and packs of boys roaming the lanes in search of the kinds of adventures they imagined their fathers might be enjoying. Mick Jackson's curious second novel pitches up in the midst of one such village in south Devon. It begins as the story of an evacuee, Billy, who arrives, like all fictional evacuees, on the doorstep of the local spinster in the dead of night with his cardboard suitcase and gas mask, and an absolute sense of mortifying alienation. It quickly, however, becomes the story of the five local boys, all born within a few weeks of each other, who first torment Billy, then befriend him. And, eventually, it turns into something else entirely. Jackson structures most of his novel around the familiar setpieces of the stay-at-home army: the stray German fighter plane that machine guns the high street; the shell-shocked deserter holed up in the woods; the cocky GIs jitterbugging in the village hall; the local eccentric rumoured to be a spy. He tells these tales straight, and with enough verve, conviction and comedy to make them absorbing, if not always entirely fresh. His gift, as in his singular first book, The Underground Man, which relived the obsession of a duke who built a labyrinth, is to give much of his incidental storytelling the quality of fable. And in the collateral damage to village routine brought on by the war, he finds plenty of realism to make magic with. There is, for example, the story of the pig in the coffin. A prize sow is at large in the no-go area cordoned off by the Americans for their D-Day rehearsals. The pig becomes the stuff of fantasy for the ration-book imaginations of the villagers and a plot is concocted to recapture it during a mocked-up funeral procession. The pig, meanwhile, is drunk on fermenting apples... Somewhat in the manner of Dad's Army, one everyday tale of extraordinary oddness runs into the next. There is the vicar who believes his arthritis can be cured by bee-stings, the smallholder who harvests a field full of rats, and the long retired sea captain who, when not making ships in bottles, trains his telescope on the keep-fit classes of the local Women's Institute. These twinkle-eyed episodes cast in the khaki light of nostalgia are told with a wry precision. Jackson is sure-footed in finding his way around snug parlours alive to the sound of Children's Hour, schoolrooms in which whole afternoons could be taken up showing how sentences carried meaning 'like goods trains', and packed churches in which 'the organ groaned into life, the bones of a tune were thrown out to the congregation and the great cogs of Sunday morning turned again'. He has fun, too, with some of the more mundane iconography of the time: one story hinges on a boy's knitted balaclava, another on the rolled-up naturist magazine under a soldier's bunk. The five boys are borrowed from an emblematic period piece: the five faces on a prewar Fry's chocolate bar, each chunk of which had a different childish expression on it, ranging from 'desperation' to 'realisation'. In a loose sense, the boys' progress through their war follows this schematic rite of passage; it is as if William Brown had signed up for a self-actualisation programme. Then, when all but one of their fathers returns home from the front, the boys find themselves usurped in their mastery of mothers and home, by stiff, balding men they hardly recognise. When they look elsewhere for role-models and adventure, their wishes are granted by the author with the arrival of 'the Bee King', who comes into the village and the novel from nowhere, sets up house, erects buzzing hives in his garden and proves to the boys that there is honey still for tea. Jackson, who the blurb explains is a novice beekeeper (you wonder if he took up the hobby having written two-thirds of the book), begins to explore the community of the hive as a metaphor for restructuring other fractured societies. This metaphor becomes both more literal and more fantastical as the Bee King turns Pied Piper and then avenging angel: leading the boys out of the village, before revealing the dark wartime secret at the heart of the book. This sting is unexpected and seems to come from another novel entirely - Richmal Crompton meets Iain Banks. It does, however, leave you a long way from where you began, and wondering about home."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
