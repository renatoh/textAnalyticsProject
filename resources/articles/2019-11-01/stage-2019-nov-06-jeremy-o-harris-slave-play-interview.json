He knew his Broadway debut, Slave Play, worked with white audiences \u2013 but he wasn\u2019t confident that it worked with black ones. His anxiety only grew after the premiere, especially when he heard black people suggest that he wrote Slave Play solely for white consumption. \u201cI would say, in this moment, where so many black artists are getting opportunities for the first time, it can feel like you have to make black art for all black people,\u201d said Harris. His anxieties capture the struggles of being a black artist who wants to highlight something new about race in America: you upset both sides. Slave Play explores micro-level manifestations of racial trauma among three interracial couples who engage in slave-era sexual fantasies to resolve their relationship issues. The result is a work that attempts to highlight how we all embody complicated, imperfect ideas about ourselves, others, and the people we love. The reception to Harris\u2019s absurdist vision has been a mixture of fear, confusion, and pure amusement. The New York Post called the production \u201cBroadway\u2019s most thoughtful mess\u201d, while Vulture wrote: \u201cEveryone is an archetype and yet no one feels flat or condescendingly sketched.\u201d Robert O\u2019Hara, the director of Slave Play, told the Guardian he was attracted to what Harris had written because it was \u201cdangerous and necessary\u201d. O\u2019Hara has seen previous black playwrights moving from the wings to center stage. His own first play \u2013 which imagined a young, black, gay man traveling back in time to the Nat Turner rebellion \u2013 was staged in 1996. \u201cBecause black people are not a monolith. There are so many different ways to examine who we are. The more we acknowledge that, the better we are.\u201d We caught up with Harris to discuss theater audiences, self-censorship, and his advice for young playwrights. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. How are you feeling since Slave Play debuted on Broadway? Well, I feel anxious and busy, basically. That\u2019s the space I\u2019m in all the time. Anxious and busy. I\u2019ve been in that space for two years and I\u2019ll probably be in it for a year more. Just \u2026 consistent anxiety and feeling overwhelmed by how quickly things are moving. But it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing! The play is deeply nuanced in its approach towards race. Did you ever expect to see it on Broadway? I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s on Broadway in the sense that the goal was never Broadway. The people I worship inside of the canon have never been on Broadway. Or, if they were, it was at a time when Broadway had a lot of risk-taking and daring writing happening. Broadway during the 60s and 70s was really wild. I think a lot of things changed in the wake of the 90s \u2026 The 90s changed who we thought Broadway was for. And fast-forward to today, where that shift in audience is occurring again \u2013 but with your play. What do you hope Slave Play accomplishes? I wanted to push the audience of Broadway to its limits and really challenge who we think sees a play. I don\u2019t think there are any other plays articulating that as their goal. The challenges we are setting are not the box office or how much money we can make. It\u2019s: \u201cHow can we change what the next generation of theater-goers look like?\u201d During previews of Slave Play, you held a night where you invited black artists and students to come see the show at a discounted price. That was me being able to look certain people in the face and say: \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d So many people have dictated what my intentions were with Slave Play. One of the things they\u2019ve always articulated is that I wrote Slave Play for white people and that it\u2019s not written for a black audience. That\u2019s so bizarre to me. Because the first audience I ever wrote this for was an audience of my classmates at Yale. And the people who were most upset by it, back then, were the white viewers. It was amazing to sit in a 99.9% black audience and see that 99.9% of the play worked. And the parts that exhilarated the audience on other nights still exhilarated the audience that night. Or parts that don\u2019t usually work on other nights did that night. Because they were parts that were specifically black. The night was a chance for you to see that it did work with a black audience. Yes, my play has been widely written about by white theater critics and beloved by them. But I got to see there was validation from all the black theater critics as well. It was a room full of other black faces laughing at the same moments, having the same epiphanies, crying at the same moments, and feeling the same depths. And one of the great things about the play, like any good play should have, there were even people \u2013 in a room full of black folks \u2013 who didn\u2019t like it. It felt like the ratio of people who liked it and didn\u2019t like it was very similar to the ratio of white people who liked it and didn\u2019t like it. Which also told me something about the universality of the play. Or maybe not even the universality \u2013 but the Americanness of it. What is your advice to other aspiring, young, black playwrights? You need to make black art for your black self. And hope that it connects to other people\u2019s black selves. In the lead-up to this play going to Broadway, I spent so much time worrying about all the ways that my black play wasn\u2019t connecting with certain black audience members that I was ignoring the black audience members that it was connecting to. We can succumb to a fear-based culture really easily, especially when bad people are in charge. That\u2019s when we should be the loudest and the most individualistic, because that\u2019s the only way to actually combat fascism. When I speak to artists \u2013 especially artists from oppressed groups \u2013 I see them necessitating this self-censorship. And I\u2019m like: \u201cNo, be free! The only time you can be free in this world is when you\u2019re writing.\u201d At the John Golden Theatre, New York, until 19 January"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
