Do not be fooled, however: age has not really withered Thomas Sturges Watson, 59. He still gives the ball a belt off the tee, still smacks those iron shots crisply, manages once more to march rather than stroll. The good, old rampaging days may be long gone but, clearly, the bad, new ones have yet to arrive. \"Yeah, the hip thing has gone really well, thanks,\" he says. \"It's been a very successful operation. Best of all, the pain I was experiencing at night in bed has now gone. I can't tell you how good that feels. It will also feel good to play in an Open at Turnberry again. \"It's one of my favourite courses in the UK and, naturally, The Open I won there all those years ago is one of the majors I most cherish. To beat Jack Nicklaus that year and for us to play as well as we did was special. So, yes, it will be good to be back there.\" It will be good to see him there, too. Watson's five victories make him one of The Open's immortals. He won two Masters and a US Open as well, but the title that defines him as a golfer and as a man is the one he won at Turnberry in 1977. It was the first Championship to be staged on this piece of Ayrshire real estate and it remains the most vibrant of the modern era. Known as the Duel in the Sun thanks to the weather and the imagination of some sub-editor who coined a headline that has turned into an everlasting tribute, Watson's joust with Nicklaus was special even by the extraordinary standards of two exquisitely talented players. Their contest was a dusty slugfest, a series of body blows, but it was also a heavyweight contest that was pleasingly embroidered with both subtlety and high-minded sportsmanship. Old school, maybe, but none the worse for that. Nicklaus had come into that Open as the pre-eminent player of his day and quite possibly the greatest ever to draw either breath or a one iron. Watson arrived in town as the new hot golfer and a man who had finally shrugged off the criticism that he lacked the nerve to compete properly during golf's biggest weeks. Victories in the 1975 Open and the 1977 Masters had taken care of that little problem, but he admits to having been concerned for a while way back then. The critics, always eager for blood, jumped on him when he blew an outstanding chance to win the US Open in 1974. Turns out he jumped on himself more. \"I had a chat with Ben Hogan shortly after that week and I asked him \u2013 the 'Ice Man', remember \u2013 if he had ever gotten nervous. I recall Ben waited a moment, then he looked at me and said: 'Nervous, Tom? Sometimes I was jumping out of my skin'. Then I asked Lee Trevino the same question and he said: 'Some days I wake up and I'm so nervous I cannot hold the fork steady at breakfast.' Those guys' honesty helped me.\" After two rounds the pair were tied for the lead, a stroke ahead of the field. By the end of the third round they were three shots clear, each having shot 65. By mid-afternoon on the fourth day Nicklaus and Watson were so far ahead of everyone else they were competing in a different Open. Tom returned another 65 to Jack's 66. Crucially, Watson had birdied the 17th. Nicklaus's final flourish came after a drive into deep clag, a bludgeoning recovery and an improbable birdie putt from about a mile. Watson breathed deeply and holed his own four-footer for victory. \"I knew I'd have to hole that last putt to win because I just knew Jack would can that long putt of his. No one has had more last-green birdies in majors than him so I was prepared. Sort of.\" While Hubert Green quietly secured third place 10 shots behind Nicklaus, goodness knows how many thousands scrambled to watch the memorable head-to-head. Great clouds of dust were kicked up everywhere as this herd of people stampeded this way and that to try to see the action. Stewards were rendered impotent by the sheer, incoherent mass so that play had to be halted for 15 minutes after Nicklaus complained about the hectic scene around the turn. Jack and Tom and their caddies stood around or sat on their bags while some semblance of order was restored. Legend has it they chatted away but actually hardly anything was said. These guys were too far into the zone to articulate much beyond a considered grunt and a vacant gaze at the Irish Sea. \"No, we didn't really speak. When we came back out things were better ordered. But it was still a bit crazy. At the 14th tee we had to wait while all these spectators crossed the fairway about 70 yards up ahead. They were kicking up so much dust it looked like fog as we squinted into the early evening sun. It felt kind of spiritual, like something out of Michael Murphy's book Golf in the Kingdom.\" This spiritual feeling was soon diluted by the hard task of the moment. Jack Nicklaus has never lost a major, someone else has had to win it. When Watson finally did just that his great rival pulled him towards him as they exited that final green. \"Jack was the most gracious competitor I've ever seen in defeat. I've never seen anybody so able to take defeat and give credit to the other player even though he is hurting so much inside. And he did that when we walked off that green. He put his arm round me and just about broke my neck, he squeezed me so hard. He said: 'Tom, I gave it my best shot but it wasn't good enough. Congratulations.'\" Watson's five Opens were won between 1975 and 1983 before his putter began stuttering in the mid-80s. He lost a bit of heart with things on and off the course. Life for a while turned sour. Then, following divorce, he regained his enthusiasm for things. He continues to play because the game \"is part of my soul\" and when he looks at the younger players coming up he hopes to see what he has always looked for when he analyses them \u2013 passion and desire. He was one of the first to spot these qualities in a young Tiger Woods and told us that when this kid turned pro he would have more of an impact on the game than anyone for at least 50 years. Some thought he had been at his favourite malt whisky again but no, he was spot\u2011on. \"I was watching Tiger not long ago in the company of Jack [Nicklaus] and I said: 'Jack, he is the best ever, don't you think?' Jack said: 'Yes.' Then I felt a bit embarrassed because I'd just said this to Jack Nicklaus and so I added: 'Mind you, you were quite good yourself,' and Jack smiled that way he does and replied: 'Yeah, I suppose, looking back, I was quite good.'\" Naturally, it was Watson who partnered Nicklaus on his long walk out of The Open Championship when Jack played for the last time at St Andrews in 2005. As they stopped for photographers on the Swilken Bridge that sunny Friday afternoon and took in the extraordinary scene as players and public lined the old fairway, it was Watson who broke up. \"Yeah, that was me. I was just thinking about all the great times we'd had but Jack turned me and said in that stern way of his, 'Pull yourself together Tom, you've got a hole to complete and a cut to make in The Open'.\" Watson did both, finishing tied for 41st place. Next year it is his turn to play his final Open himself at St Andrews and the crowds will be just as big when he comes up the 18th. He always has been one of Scotland's favourite adopted sons. He even prefers a tweed cap to a baseball hat, bless him. Word is that he is beginning to try to pull himself together as we speak. I have every expectation that he will spectacularly fail to do so. He will not be alone. No doubt he will think back to the moment 34 years ago when he first encountered bouncy, linksland golf. For a man who was born, raised and who still lives in Kansas it was weird stuff he found. There was no instant attraction. \"When I turned up early for my first Open at Carnoustie in '75 the then R&amp;A secretary Keith Mackenzie told me the course wasn't available for practice at that time. Instead I went down the road to Monifieth for my first taste of a links. I can see my first drive now. It was perfect, right down the middle. \"But I couldn't find my ball when I got down there. Eventually I discovered it in a five-feet deep, wee pot bunker. It had bounced sideways some fifty yards. I thought: 'What the heck is this about?'\" Then he figured it out, realised that the links game is as much about self-control as ball-control, that it relies as much on patience and imagination as it does on technique and that little slices of decent fortune can mean almost everything. He knows also that the better golfer usually wins these things. Fate might be unpredictable but it is more often than not quite fair. A psychology degree from Stanford helped him arrive at this happy place. \"Some guys never take to links golf,\" he says through his trademark Huckleberry grin. \"I was lucky, I did.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
