In fact, so intent was Blige on imbuing the album with the sound of young London that its recording was allegedly fuelled by a very British stimulant: fish and chips. (You can only presume spontaneous Morris dancing and jokes about John Terry broke out between vocal takes.) Blige found time to visit Mitch Winehouse, to pay her respects to his daughter, and the opening song here, Therapy, is a self-conscious nod towards Amy Winehouse\u2019s Rehab. Elsewhere, things feel more natural. Blige has the vocal charisma to lift up several piano ballads, and when genuine infusions of the current London scene occur \u2013 most effectively on Right Now, the track produced by Disclosure \u2013 it neatly refreshes her sound. \u2022 Mary J Blige interview: \u2018The UK is a better place to make music than the States\u2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
