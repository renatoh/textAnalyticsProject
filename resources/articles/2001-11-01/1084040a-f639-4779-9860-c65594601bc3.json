Meanwhile Crystal Palace's disaffected manager Steve Bruce's proposed move to St Andrews looks even less wise after this weekend. Palace moved up to second after thrashing Crewe 4-1 at home thanks to first-half goals from Jovan Kirovski, the prolific Clinton Morrison and Dougie Freedman, plus an own-goal from David Walton. Stiff silences were to be expected over the dinner table as a brace from Paul Peschisolido helped Sheffield United to a 4-0 win over Birmingham. City's managing director, Karren Brady, is his wife. Portsmouth and Manchester City were level on points after Pompey came from behind to secure a 2-1 home win. Lee Bradbury and Peter Crouch cancelled out Darren Huckerby's first-half header. A last-minute goal from Darren Moore could not prevent West Brom's fourth away defeat of the season. Rotherham snatched the 2-1 win courtesy of Chris Swailes and Alan Lee. Meanwhile Bradford's manager Jim Jefferies' faith in his former Hearts winger Juanjo has paid off. The free transfer came off the bench to score in a 2-0 victory over Walsall . Barnsley are still second from bottom despite drawing 1-1 with mid-table Wimbledon. The spoils were also shared at the City Ground as Nottingham Forest held Preston to a 1-1 draw, ending a run of three successive defeats. Grimsby conceded an equaliser three minutes into added time at home to Millwall, Steve Claridge taking the score to 2-2."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
