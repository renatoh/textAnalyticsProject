But medical professionals warn that the climate emergency is likely to have a far wider reach. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) put out a climate change and human health position statement this year, recognising the climate crisis as a key public health issue. The position statement cites a long list of health effects that could result from higher temperatures and increased heatwaves, bushfires, droughts and storms. These include risk of stroke and heat stress, worsening chronic respiratory, cardiac and kidney conditions, and psychiatric illness. Dr Tim Senior, who works at the Tharawal Aboriginal Corporation in south-west Sydney, is always busy, but the practice has been getting even more traffic lately. Like other GPs across the country, Dr Senior has a front-row seat to the growing impact of the climate crisis on the health of Australians. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more people coming in the last few weeks, with the smoke coming down from the bushfires in New South Wales, presenting with coughs, difficulty breathing - more than you\u2019d usually expect,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been aware increasingly of people coming in with symptoms that could be put down to climate change. The other doctors are seeing the same things; we\u2019re all seeing that.\u201d Brace for impact: it\u2019s going to get worse The RACGP\u2019s concerns are wide ranging, and cover the short and long term. Dr Senior says changing environmental impacts, such as air pollution, water access, and nutrition, will have flow-on effects for people\u2019s health. There are also concerns specific to different regions. \u201cSome GPs in southern Queensland will see more dengue fever coming through,\u201d Dr Senior says. \u201cWhere I live it might be more Ross River or Barmah Forest virus.\u201d Then there are the indirect impacts, such as the effect of drought on food production, resulting in a poorer quality diet. Vulnerable patients, who already struggle to afford adequate housing, heating or cooling, will be the first affected and least able to deal with weather extremes. The mental load Drought, bushfires and floods have been shown to have severe and long-term effects on mental health. They can also make existing problems worse. \u201cIf you\u2019re already struggling for money or work, having other difficulties piled on top - such as drought, going through a flood, or seeing your children get unwell because of the effect of a heatwave - that adds stress,\u201d Dr Senior says. Instead of drinking water, \u201cyellow sludge\u201d came out of the taps on the day that Dr Senior visited Walgett, a town in northern NSW. Residents had to boil it or wait for bottled supplies. \u201cYou can imagine the [mental] impact of having to do that for something that we take for granted - it is terrifying.\u201d Three states across the east of Australia have seen tighter water restrictions due to the severity of the drought.

Born into a heating world Older Australians, children, and those with pre-existing conditions are likely to feel the health effects of the climate crisis earlier than the general population, but children have the most to lose, according to a report by Doctors for the Environment Australia. Research has found that globally, 88% of disease due to climate change is borne by children under the age of five, the report says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get your head around that,\u201d Dr Senior says. \u201cThey will live through climate change in a way that no other generation has had to. They won\u2019t know anything but chaotic climate. \u201cAnd we know from a lot of the research into health inequality that the first five years of life, as well as pregnancy, are crucial in terms of future health. They have a massive impact.\u201d Managing your health in a changing environment Dr Senior says GPs understand what communities are going through, because it\u2019s affecting them, too. GPs are best placed to help patients understand how changing temperatures and environment can affect their current conditions, or potentially spark new health concerns. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been advising behavioural change, and it\u2019s based on having a therapeutic relationship with people,\u201d he says. \u201cThe behaviours that keep us well - walking more, driving less, eating less meat and less processed food, for example - also protect the environment. \u201cOur patients come first, which means our interventions are based on good science and evidence, along with a good understanding of the people we\u2019re working with.\u201d That can entail advising individual patients at risk from heat or smoke to stay indoors at particular times, or advocating for those with respiratory illnesses to get better housing (as Dr Senior does). It can also mean discussing interventions - such as diet, transport, energy usage, and community initiatives - to limit the effects of the climate crisis. \u201cWe treat people and then we send them back to the circumstances that made them unwell,\u201d Dr Senior says, \u201cbut it\u2019s much better for all of us if we\u2019re able to be kept well.\u201d GPs see 84% of the Australian population each year. \u201cThat\u2019s a massive reach. It\u2019s a real opportunity to talk about the ways of mitigating climate change, the effects on their health.\u201d The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) is Australia\u2019s largest professional general practice organisation - our mission is to improve the health and wellbeing of all people in Australia by supporting GPs, general practice registrars and medical students."}, "isHosted": false}}}
