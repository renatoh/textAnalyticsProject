The procedures are legal, characterised by medical need, and require specific expertise, but are, of course, aggressively targeted by pro-life campaigners, who harass doctors and firebomb premises. Their activities are America's everyday terrorism. It's a grim story. Often, US media talk about the abortion \"debate\" \u2013 but there is no debate, more like a cold-war style faceoff between people diametrically opposed to each other. However, it is the pro-lifers who can mobilise the bully squads, deploy the 24-hour a passive-aggressive pickets and evidently call on individuals more than ready to carry out acts of righteous violence. Liberals can't muster that kind of firepower, and my worry about After Tiller is that it seems to offer the pro-choice side no debating or campaigning strategy. Anyway: a sombre study.
