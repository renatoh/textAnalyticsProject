The biggest concern with NSW in 2013 was the passiveness of their halves pairing, who refused to take the game on. The same could not be said for Canterbury\u2019s Trent Hodkinson and Josh Reynolds, who were as aggressive as you could hope for from a rookie pairing tackling a team coming off eight straight series victories. They kicked to open space, gave the Blues great field position, tackled hard and competed on every play. It's unlikely Pearce will ever play Origin again and the Blues have finally given themselves a chance to win a series. The big concern for the Blues now is a potential suspension that hovers over the head of five-eighth Reynolds for an ugly looking lifting tackle that saw Maroons winger Brent Tate flipped over completely. The NRL Match Review Committee charged Reynolds with a grade two dangerous throw that will rub him out of the second encounter if he fails to beat the penalty. Tate has since said the tackle left him \"shaking\" and feared he would sustain an injury similar to Alex McKinnon. 2) The Hayne plane Jarryd Hayne has played 18 Origin matches for NSW but incredibly has started just four at full-back. It is clearly his best position. He proved the difference in an even encounter. His bootlaces catch midway through the first half was a special moment that halted Queensland\u2019s momentum while his try \u2013 though questionable \u2013 was something special. He did not rest on his laurels at half-time with a penetrating break to go with some special defensive work. A total of 10 tackle breaks to go with two offloads made him the most dangerous player on the paddock. He was a deserved winner of the Man of the Match award. The NSW selectors won\u2019t play him out of position again. 3) Width, width, width NSW went into Wednesday night\u2019s game with precisely the right tactics. They played with width early in their sets and it worked a treat. The concern with the Blues in recent times \u2013 particularly under Ricky Stuart \u2013 is that they play far too conservatively when hauling the ball out from their own line. That certainly wasn\u2019t an issue in Origin I where the Blues stretched Queensland, forcing some early one-on-one defensive decision making. It may not have resulted in a try but it wore Queensland down and forced the Maroons to think. The Blues will need to be on their toes in the second game because Slater is rediscovering his best form and we all know how he can turn a game and a series on a single piece of brilliance. 4) Billy the kid Many were willing to write off Billy Slater heading into Origin I after an early 2014 where he has struggled for form. Slater was magnificent for the Maroons though, arguably the best on the field with over 180 metres. He remains a genuine matchwinner and is at his best at Origin level. While the Maroons threw very little at NSW in structured attack, Slater was a perennial danger returning kicks and bobbing up in attacking pieces. 5) The axe hovers Queensland selectors have built a reputation for being loyal but they will almost certainly make changes before Origin II. Cooper Cronk is gone with Daly Cherry-Evans to start and Jake Friend to debut on the bench. More needs to be done though. No longer can the Maroons afford to carry passengers. Chris McQueen will go for Sam Thaiday while the likes of Ben Te\u2019o, Justin Hodges and Josh Papalii must all be in trouble. Queensland cannot use loyalty at the expense of winning. The Blues may have to ring in the changes themselves despite the rousing win. Josh Morris will miss the game with a PCL injury, Anthony Watmough\u2019s season may be over after potentially rupturing his biceps, Brett Morris could be absent after dislocating his shoulder and Josh Reynolds could be suspended. Veteran Greg Bird is one certain inclusion after missing the opener with the likes of Josh Jackson, Shaun Fensom, Will Hopoate, Josh Mansour and Jorge Taufua all likely to come into consideration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
