The British Chambers of Commerce releases a survey to coincide with the opening of its annual conference in London, which shows that more than 90% of its members fear business taxes will rise further, as they have done under Labour since 1997. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, and Conservative leader Michael Howard will address the BCC conference today in an attempt to get business on their side. But BCC president Bill Midgley warned neither man should expect an easy ride. \"Taxation is one of the biggest issues of concern,\" he said. \"The continuing debate over whether taxes will have to rise is a major worry and employers need a firm commitment that business taxes will not go up.\" The BCC calculates that taxes on business have gone up by \u00a339bn since 1998. The most visible increase was a rise in employers' national insurance contributions in 2003. The BCC's view was backed by a report from the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, which said the chancellor faced the prospect of diminishing corporate tax payments as more firms could be lured to lower tax countries in eastern Europe. \"There is a cold blast of tax competition coming in from the new EU accession states that could limit the government's ability to boost its deficit,\" says Professor Peter Spencer, the Item Club's chief economic adviser. Mr Spencer, in common with other independent economists, thinks the chancellor is over-optimistic in forecasting a big surge in corporate tax receipts and will be forced to raise tax or national insurance again next year to reduce the public deficit and meet the government's own golden rule. Former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke is also critical of Labour's budget deficit. Writing in today's Guardian, Mr Clarke argues that Mr Brown's record on forecasting the public finances has been abysmal. He accuses Labour of ruining the legacy he bequeathed it. \"I passed on to Gordon Brown the strongest economy and the soundest public finances for a generation. Mr Brown will pass on the bills of an unreformed public sector, a growing pension crisis and an increasing tax burden, which by stealth is undermining the strong economy he inherited,\" Mr Clarke says. However, research by Robert Barrie of CSFB in London argues that talk of a \"black hole\" in the public finances may be wide of the mark. They have shown an improvement in recent months which, if continued, could make tax rises unnecessary. \"The evidence suggests the public finances might have improved significantly in recent months. The question is whether it's a temporary improvement or something that persists,\" he says. Another report, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, suggests the government's drive to improve the country's poor record on productivity has little to show for it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
