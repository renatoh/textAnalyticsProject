The rest of English football will be overcome by a queasy sense of inferiority this morning, the loudest gulps of trepidation doubtless emanating from Anfield, Highbury and Elland Road. But United cannot afford to think so horizontally and Veron is clearly looking beyond the confines of the Premiership for his kicks. \"I think we have a better chance of winning the European Cup than Real Madrid,\" he announced, Sir Alex Ferguson smiling appreciatively as the Argentina international eased through his introductory press conference. Having reinforced his side's European ambitions with arguably one of the world's finest midfielders, in the process not merely breaking the British transfer record but smashing it to smithereens, Ferguson could scarcely disguise his joy. Veron's signing, he said, was a statement of intent for the attention of their European rivals, the confirmation that his final year as manager will be spent in determined pursuit of the continent's top prize. With the eventual fee paid to Lazio soaring to \u00a328.1m - \u00a34m more than expected - the message has come across loud and clear. \"We're delighted to be here,\" said Veron, looking above the flashing cameras and towards the back of Old Trafford's Stafford Suite to his partner Maria, who will have the job of teaching him English. \"I've always maintained that one truly great player can make the difference,\" said Ferguson. \"I've spoken about Ronaldo as a young player and many of the other greats. Veron fits into that category and, together with Ruud van Nistelrooy, he can make all the difference. I never thought I would spend this much on one player but, quite simply, this is something Manchester United had to do. Veron is such a special player, everyone across Europe has been forced to sit up and take notice.\" Somebody asked whether Veron would cope with the demands of the Premiership. \"Have you seen the football in Argentina?\" Ferguson replied. \"Just look at the players they've produced - Sensini, Simeone, Zanetti, Crespo, Batistuta - they are all very strong, physically and mentally. Veron is the same. We're bringing in the best and everyone else will have to compete with that.\" The 26-year-old Veron, the first South American to be signed by Ferguson, was asked about the somewhat infamous role his father Juan Ramon Veron played as a member of the Estudiantes team that met United in a brutal confrontation in the 1968 Inter-continental Cup final. It drew a smile from Veron Jr and an answer that a politician would have been proud of. \"I had better be careful and tone down what he actually said,\" he smiled. \"But I do remember he spoke of the great atmosphere of Old Trafford and what it was like to be playing against greats such as Bobby Charlton.\" \"I was aware that United are one of the best, if not the best, clubs in the world. But most importantly to me, they stuck by me during the recent passport investigation in Italy. They were very supportive and now I will repay them. I just hope I can satisfy everyone's aspirations.\" He revealed that the England and former Lazio manager Sven-Goran Eriksson had contacted him to recommend English football, dissuading him from a move to Internazionale. \"From working with Mr Eriksson I respect everything he has to say,\" he said. \"He told me it would be a good opportunity and that my style would suit English football.\" Veron, who has signed a five-year contract, had his work permit rushed through by the Home Office yesterday and he will wear the No4 shirt. \"Last season was not good enough,\" said Ferguson. Next season Veron intends to help put matters right.
