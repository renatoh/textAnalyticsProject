O\u2019Neil will use a speech on Monday to point to the vulnerabilities of particular cohorts of male workers as the recession moves from the \u201cartificial\u201d phase of government-imposed shutdowns to the \u201corganic phase\u201d of sustained downturn. The Labor frontbencher will draw on research from McKinsey to note some of the hardest hit industries running into March next year will be construction, where 88% of the workforce is male, manufacturing (73% male-dominated) and professional services (57% male-dominated in the legal and consulting professions). O\u2019Neil says McKinsey estimates that when jobkeeper and jobseeker payments are withdrawn, just under half a million jobs will be lost, and she says analysis she has undertaken indicates more than 60% of the jobs will be lost by men. She notes the gender switch, with male employment now being harder hit than female employment, is already manifesting in labour market statistics, with the male unemployment rate now at 7.14% compared to female 6.71%. \u201cMale unemployment has risen more than female unemployment during the Covid period,\u201d she will say. O\u2019Neil will also note that more men than women are leaving the labour market. She says jobs traditionally performed by men are more at risk during the structural change that accompanies recessions \u2013 change like offshoring, automation and outsourcing. Qantas, O\u2019Neil says, is a case in point. \u201cDespite having received $800m from the Australian taxpayer, the company has decided to permanently shed 6,000 workers.\u201d She says part of that shift is outsourcing ground crews, which are predominately male. O\u2019Neil on Monday will release new data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics tracking participation trends by male workers in the labour market. \u201cAccording to the ABS, the participation rate of men of working age who did not complete a post-school qualification fell from 83.4% in 1994 to 73.6% in 2019 \u2013 what this tells us is that for this group, one-in-four are not in the labour force at all, and that this dropped by 10 points over about 20 years,\u201d she will say. \u201cIn 1994, of those employed in this group, 94% were in full time work. But by 2019, only 73% were working full-time.\u201d She says for many men, those falls occurred over the past five years. \u201cFor men with a Certificate I or II qualification, their share of full-time employment dropped from 82% to 77% just in the last five years.\u201d \u201cThese dramatic falls all happened in a growing economy,\u201d O\u2019Neil will say. \u201cI shudder to think what will happen to those men now that the economy is going backwards and wage subsidies are about to be removed, just when they are most urgently needed.\u201d O\u2019Neil will argue while there is an open dialogue in Australia about what is needed to boost women\u2019s participation in the labour market and improve their job readiness, \u201cthe discussion about issues affecting men feels truly fraught\u201d. She points to a palpable division in the labour market between the \u201cmasters of the universe\u201d \u2013 highly educated men who reside in urban areas, and men with less education and fewer opportunities. O\u2019Neil will argue Australia needs a more open conversation in policy terms about what happens during periods of structural adjustment. She says one of the problems to confront is with men who are not getting the support they need to finish school, or go beyond. \u201cThis is not a small problem: millions of men in the workforce today are in this situation. \u201cRight before the pandemic over 400,000 of these men couldn\u2019t get the hours they need or couldn\u2019t get a job at all \u2013 that\u2019s an under-utilised group of men about the size of the population of Canberra.\u201d She says some men outside the masters of the universe cohort are \u201cthriving, flourishing, and highly skilled via long years of on-the-job training\u201d but on average men with lesser skills and qualifications are experiencing a period of protracted economic decline. \u201cIt is absolutely the case that a group of economically and socially privileged men are the big winners in the future of work,\u201d O\u2019Neil will say. \u201cBut for many Australian men, things are going backwards and the public discussion just doesn\u2019t reflect their reality.\u201d \u201cI worry because if we don\u2019t do a really good job at expressing these concerns in politics, more Australian men and women will look to the fringes \u2013 to political shysters like One Nation \u2013 for that conversation, and that\u2019s terribly, terribly bad for our country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
