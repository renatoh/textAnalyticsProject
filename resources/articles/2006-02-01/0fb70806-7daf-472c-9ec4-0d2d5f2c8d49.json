Russia wants the money it repays to the so-called Paris Club of creditor nations, which include all the other G8 members, to be used to help write off debts owed by the world's poorest countries to multilateral lenders such as the World Bank and African Development Bank (ADB), agreed at last summer's G8 summit in Gleneagles. Russia took over the chairmanship of the G8 from Britain last month and is hoping to bolster its international standing by paying off the debts it owes to other countries. It plans to use increased revenues from high energy prices. Last year it paid back $15bn, helped by windfall receipts from surging oil prices. Russia is now the world's second largest exporter of oil and also supplies the European Union with a quarter of its gas. Its chairmanship of the G8 got off to a bad start last month when it temporarily switched off gas supplies to Ukraine and several EU member states. This year's repayment would virtually clear the country's debts to the Paris Club. It has already paid off debts to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The Jubilee Debt Campaign group urged the G8 ministers to ensure that the debt write-off for up to 38 of the world's poorest countries be carried out in full. Separately, sources close to Gordon Brown said the chancellor would use a speech on Monday to announce a host of additional measures to combat the funding of terrorist groups around the world through the international financial system. He will announce the creation for a modern-day Bletchley Park, the second world war centre famous for breaking codes. Mr Brown believes Britain must set up a specialist unit where experts can work on identifying, tracking and breaking down terrorists' financial networks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
