John Schiefer, a security consultant, was arrested following the FBI's Operation Bot Roast II investigation and pleaded guilty last year. He also has to pay back $19,000 to PayPal and other firms. Basically, the crime-ring collected log-on names and passwords and used them to make purchases. Schiefer also installed adware on a Dutch company's computers. If this sounds familiar, it's because we covered it in November 2007, in Botnet creator pleads guilty, faces jail: 250K PCs safe again (we hope), when Charles Arthur wrote: \"he faces up to 60 years in prison and (and?) a $1.75m (\u00a3850,000) fine.\" What makes the story interesting now is that Jason Calacanis has spoken up for him on his blog. It turns out that Mahalo hired Schiefer without knowing about his crimes -- someone forgot to use Google -- and thinks he's worth a second chance. He could have fired him, of course, but: The other option was to keep John on and deal with the potential firestorm of criticism that we're now facing. I chose to put my job and reputation on the line and keep John employed. At this moment, I'm honestly glad we didn't know about what John did when we hired him and I'm happy we've kept him on board. It's taught me a lot about society, computer crime and rehabilitation. Calacanis points out that \"Almost all talented developers push the envelope when they're young. Anyone in technology knows this dark, dirty little secret,\" and he gives some examples. But, he says: I'm hoping that the time he's spent being a productive member of the Mahalo team inspires him to keep his head down in jail. When he comes out, I hope to be able to offer him a job and that we can work together again. Life is short, we all make mistakes and I'm glad we've been given the opportunity to work with someone who needs the help and guidance. Props to Calacanis for his stand. Let's hope it all works out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
