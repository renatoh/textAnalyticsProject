The world No4 deserved his win tonight, playing the more consistent tennis in the decisive moments and producing a string of memorable winners, but Federer will be encouraged by the way that Wawrinka almost choked at the end. It was far from a flawless performance. Still, he got there eventually, and he\u2019ll be up for it tomorrow night. Tomorrow promises to be a great day, Novak Djokovic v Rafael Nadal at 2pm and Roger Federer v Stan Wawrinka at 8pm. For Andy Murray, it\u2019s time to think about the Davis Cup. Thanks for reading tonight. Bye. Andy Murray storms off court, stopping to chuck something into the crowd. I think it was his broken racket. He\u2019s raging as he disappears. That was a fairly eccentric performance. Defeat means he\u2019ll only be the year-end world No2 if someone stops Roger Federer winning the tournament. Wawrinka begins this game with a double-fault, before pulling a backhand wide to make it 0-30. This is ludicrous. Wawrinka is unravelling from a position of total dominance. He can\u2019t get a first serve in at the moment; but he does win the next point, Murray netting a forehand down the line to make it 15-30. He\u2019s annoyed with himself, but he finds himself with two break points when Wawrinka lazily nets a forehand. Wawrinka saves the first with a spectacular cross-court forehand, before a Murray forehand is called long by the umpire. Murray challenges, but he knows it was well out and the game goes to deuce, before Wawrinka puts a smash away to earn his first match point. Murray set it up for him with a lob. He breaks his racket, smashing it against the floor, and he\u2019s given a code violation. He gets another stay of execution when Wawrinka\u2019s forehand shortcircuits, only to net a backhand, his 29th unforced error handing Wawrinka a second match point. His 30th unforced error, a wide backhand, confirms Wawrinka\u2019s victory and Murray\u2019s exit. Wawrinka limps over the line. Murray has contrived to beat himself. Second set: Murray* 6-7, 4-5 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray holds to love. What next? Wawrinka is playing with increasing sloppiness. Surely he\u2019s not going to be broken again. At the very least, Murray has given the scoreline a sheen of respectability. Second set: Murray 6-7, 3-5 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): But wait! Serving for the match, Wawrinka makes three unspeakably lame errors to give Murray three break points. Maybe he\u2019s having second thoughts after realising he\u2019ll have to play Roger Federer if he wins this. Even then, Murray can\u2019t take the first two break points, and then he wonks a backhand long off a second serve. Yet Wawrinka continues to struggle, dumping a forehand into the net and handing over another break point. Murray takes this one with a smash, but Wawrinka still leads by a break. Second set: Murray* 6-7, 2-5 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Wawrinka slaps an irresistible backhand from left to right and bounces forward to pummel a volley away for 0-15. He fancies a second break of serve. He really fancies a second break of serve! Murray approaches the net again but Wawrinka has entered The Zone, directing an amazing backhand pass down the line for 0-30. Murray has his work cut out here, but he finds it within himself to win the next two points, only to smash an awful forehand well past the baseline to hand over a break point. It\u2019s effectively a match point. Murray screams at himself. Then he nets an apologetic forehand. Wawrinka breaks again. This is done. Second set: Murray 6-7, 2-4 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Murray is starting to move with more urgency again, but he ruins some good defensive work with a hopeless backhand that sails miserably wide. Wawrinka shows him how it\u2019s done with a peach of a backhand down the line for 30-0, then he flicks a glorious backhand pass beyond Murray, who had tried to win the point at the net. The Swiss holds with a punishing ace out wide. He is firmly in control. Second set: Murray* 6-7, 2-3 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray holds to love. Only one break separates them. But Wawrinka only has to hold serve three more times to win the match. Second set: Murray 6-7, 1-3 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka moves into a 30-0 lead with a whipcrack backhand down the line, Murray a forlorn figure. That\u2019s Wawrinka\u2019s 21st winner of the evening. There could be more. He makes heavy work of this game from 40-0 up, losing the next three points and allowing Murray back to deuce. But a hefty second serve draws a forehand error from Murray and Wawrinka holds, moving a game closer to victory and a semi-final with Roger Federer. Second set: Murray* 6-7, 1-2 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray appears to be mentally checking out here and checking in for his flight/train to Belgium when he sends a half-baked forehand long. Yet he responds well to win the next three points and lead 40-15. He holds to 30. Second set: Murray 6-7, 0-2 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka whizzes through a hold to love thanks to an array of cracking winners and Murray begins to think of Belgium. I hear the chocolate trade is big there. \u201cStan is undoubtedly a very talented player, but I still need to remind myself that he has won the same number of Grand Slams as Andy,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cThen again, Nottingham Forest have won the same number of European Cups as Juventus.\u201d Second set: Murray* 6-7, 0-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): It will be interesting to see how Murray responds here. Will he begin to think even more about next weekend\u2019s Davis Cup final and completely take his eye off the ball? He collapsed in the second set against Rafa Nadal the other day and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it happens again, a feeling that grows when two flat errors from Murray make it 15-30. Murray gets it back to 30-40, but Wawrinka then smashes the fuzz off a forehand down the line to earn a break point. A Murray forehand clips the top of the net and lands on his side, and the home favourite trails by a set and a break. He\u2019s in big trouble now. Andy Murray\u2019s support team is still sitting high up in the stadium, which is very odd. He\u2019s just had a long chat in his chair with a tournament suit. I assume he\u2019s complaining about crowd noise between points. There are some spectacular toolkits in the crowd tonight, people who think we\u2019re here to marvel at their wit. We\u2019re not. Shut up, never speak again, you awful, dismal, terrible people. First-set tie-break: Murray* 4-7 Wawrinka (*denotes server): A Murray forehand clips the top of the net. Wawrinka slices to the Murray forehand. For some reason, he waves a lob wide when he could easily have sent a clean winner down the line. The first set goes to Wawrinka, who won five consecutive points at the end of that tie-break. Murray\u2019s level dipped. First-set tie-break: Murray* 4-6 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray blooters a horrendous forehand miles wide! Wawrinka has two set points. Murray has let this go. First-set tie-break: Murray 4-5 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Murray drags a backhand wide off another second serve. First-set tie-break: Murray 4-4 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Murray nets a backhand off a bodied second serve. Tense. First-set tie-break: Murray* 4-3 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray nets a forehand. There goes the mini-break. First-set tie-break: Murray* 4-2 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Wawrinka nets a backhand. First-set tie-break: Murray 3-2 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Murray devastates a backhand return away off a second serve. First-set tie-break: Murray 2-2 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka clumps a forehand away. First-set tie-break: Murray* 2-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray wrongfoots Wawrinka with a clever forehand. First-set tie-break: Murray* 1-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Wawrinka bangs a forehand wide at the end of a stunning rally. \u201cwanted to watch andy murry live free,\u201d says Sandra Clifford. First-set tie-break: Murray 0-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka whistles a serve down the T. It\u2019s called out but a challenge shows it caught the line by 0.0000000001 inches. First set: Murray* 6-6 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray begins well, locating the left line with a forehand, at the net for a volley for 15-0. Good serving takes him into a 40-15 lead and he holds with an ace to secure a tie-break. \u201cMurray, with one eye on the Belgian clay already, could probably be forgiven for not giving this match his full attention, but that probably just means he\u2019ll want to win it even more, if you get my drift,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cHe really is quite the competitor.\u201d First set: Murray 5-6 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka speeds into a 40-0 lead. With no one in his box, Murray chunters at the umpire about something or other. Wawrinka holds. He\u2019s got a tie-break at least. Murray has to hold again. First set: Murray* 5-5 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray still has to hold here to keep the first set alive, so he\u2019s not out of the woods yet, especially when Wawrinka steps in and flays a trademark backhand from left to right for 0-15. Murray then wins a tense exchange when Wawrinka nets a slice for 15-all, then a backhand return for 30-15, before Murray surprises Wawrinka with a gorgeous drop shot to make it 40-15. Murray holds. First set: Murray 4-5 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Murray gees himself up after Wawrinka, who\u2019s serving for the first set, knocks a forehand long to make it 0-15. Yet Wawrinka then produces a big second serve down the middle, clocked at 111mph, and Murray stretches and nets a forehand. Wawrinka then clips a backhand volley past Murray, who uses up his last challenge claiming it was out. 30-15, Wawrinka edging closer to the first set. Yet Murray grits his way to 30-all, slamming a cross-court forehand from right to left, and a double-fault leaves from a wobbly Wawrinka makes it 30-40. Can Murray break for the first time? A forehand is called wide. The umpire says it\u2019s in and orders the point to be replayed. Incredibly Wawrinka doesn\u2019t challenge. I have no idea why - a replay shows the ball was clearly out. Not that it matters when Murray horribly miscues a forehand down the line to make it deuce. Yet Murray badly wants this break and he moves forward to feather a dainty volley away from Wawrinka to earn another break point. And Murray finally does it! Wawrinka throws everything at Murray, but he\u2019s throwing everything at one of the game\u2019s great defenders. Murray somehow stays in the rally and then, when Wawrinka plays right into his hands with a poorly directed volley straight into his opponent\u2019s hit zone, it\u2019s a simple task for Murray to knock the ball right back into the open court. Murray breaks back and Wawrinka takes it out on his racket. First set: Murray* 3-5 Wawrinka (*denotes server): An interesting development this evening is that Murray\u2019s player box is empty. They\u2019re all watching from high up in the stands. It will be fascinating to see if he shouts any obscenities at empty seats. He manages not to after netting a forehand here to make it 0-15 and the theory is put to the test even further when a double-fault plunges him into some worryingly hot water, with the potential for the temperature to increase. Wawrinka leads 0-30 and he knows it\u2019s time to properly test Murray\u2019s nerve. He dominates the next exchange and Murray nets a forehand to give Wawrinka three break points. Murray saves the first with some serve-volley, but soon Wawrinka is roaring a huge \u201cCome oooooonnnnnn!!!!\u201d after Murray sends a backhand long. Wawrinka will serve for the first set. First set: Murray 3-4 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka is called for a foot fault on his first serve. Players hates that. He looks at the line judge darkly, before walloping a forehand wide to make it 0-15. Yet he wins the next three points impressively and he holds by jabbing a backhand volley past Murray. Will Murray start to feel any scoreboard pressure? First set: Murray* 3-3 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray goes for a drop shot on the first point. Wawrinka blooters a backhand back his way, but Murray is ready and waiting with a backhand that Wawrinka blocks into the net. Wawrinka then drifts a slice wide to make it 30-0 and Murray puts away a smash for 40-0. Murray holds to love with a forehand winner. This is finely poised. First set: Murray 2-3 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka wins three easy points for a 40-0 lead. He holds to love. It\u2019s his first comfortable service game. First set: Murray* 2-2 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Having failed to break in the previous game, these could be dangerous moments for Murray, with Wawrinka presumably ready to attack. Murray starts with a 77mph second serve and he loses the point by wafting a forehand long. Wawrinka then stands up well to some big hitting from Murray and patiently waits for another forehand error for 0-30. Murray needs a first serve here. He gets one, steps forward and puts a forehand away to make it 15-30, and Wawrinka then nets a forehand down the line to make it 30-all. Yet Wawrinka then discovers a beautiful angle with a storming cross-court forehand and earns his first break point. Murray slices a good first serve down the middle, though, and brings the game to deuce. Another well-placed slice, delivered without too much pace, earns him the advantage, and he holds with a driving backhand from left to right. First set: Murray 1-2 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka begins with a double-fault, both serves down the middle flying into the net, but we go to 15-all when Murray nets a forehand. \u201cNo,\u201d he groans. He\u2019s even less impressed with himself when he knocks a backhand long off a second serve, but Wawrinka is looking a little shaky out there, and a forehand error makes it 30-all. Murray can\u2019t carve out a break point, though, knocking a backhand wide, but that\u2019s just followed by another double-fault from Wawrinka. Deuce. The next point is astonishing. Wawrinka rips a huge forehand into the left point. Murray chases it down and hooks it back, but Wawrinka is there with a volley into the opposite corner. Murray hares off in pursuit of the ball, using all his speed and athleticism, and he somehow whips a forehand down the line, past Wawrinka and right on to the baseline! Oh my. Murray isn\u2019t given a chance to test Wawrinka on the break point, though, because there\u2019s nothing he can do about a massive ace down the middle. He challenges, but the ball clipped the line. Murray gets another chance to break, but again Wawrinka finds a handy serve at a good time. Wawrinka eventually holds when he sends a forehand long and wide, but that was an almighty struggle for the Swiss. He\u2019ll be relieved. First set: Murray* 1-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray directs a serve out wide and Wawrinka invitingly tees it up for an easy volley. 15-0. Yet then there\u2019s another exhibition of the awesome power Wawrinka can generate with his forehand and Murray is left floundering, the scoreboard ticking over to 15-all. Murray responds by taking the next two points and he holds to 15 when Wawrinka bounces a forehand wide. Murray served well there. First set: Murray 0-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): It begins. Stan Wawrinka won the toss and he serves first, but it\u2019s Murray who takes the first point. The two then trade blows from the baseline, before Murray forces Wawrinka forward. Wawrinka wins the point when Murray steers a lob wide and it\u2019s not long before he\u2019s up 40-15 thanks to a cute forehand volley. Murray then stings a two-handed backhand return out of reach to make it 40-30 and the game goes to deuce when Wawrinka nets a forehand. It\u2019s an awkward start for Wawrinka, but he seizes another game point when he clubs a forehand winner into the corner, Murray too passive in the rally. He holds thanks to an ace down the middle. Tok! Tok! Tok! They\u2019re knocking up. The coin toss. Wawrinka chooses heads. It\u2019s heads. He elects to serve first. The players are out and in good time as well. Andy Murray clearly has the backing of the crowd. Andy Murray speaks! \u201cI obviously need to play a little bit better. I didn\u2019t strike the ball too cleanly the other night. I\u2019m quite clear on what my tactics are. He obviously goes for big shots off both wings. I\u2019ll try and get the percentages in my favour.\u201d Stan Wawrinka speaks! \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy it. That is the most important. He is No2 in the world. I am going to try and work for it. I will need to play my best game.\u201d Scintillating. Hello. Tennis matches are made up of countless little moments that feel significant one minute and irrelevant the next, but some shots are more important than others. Every point counts the same, but some count more than others. Take Stan Wawrinka\u2019s win over David Ferrer on Wednesday night. Wawrinka was in trouble when he found himself facing a set point on the Ferrer serve in the first set, 5-3 down and struggling to find the accuracy to go with his power in his shots. The odds were firmly against him and if he had lost the point, the French Open champion would probably have been staring at an early exit from the World Tour Finals, having already lost his opening match in straight sets to Rafael Nadal. Yet Ferrer lost his nerve, faltering and double-faulting, and then he lost his serve. Wawrinka roared back and that 7-5, 6-2 victory means that he has a great chance of setting up a repeat of his semi-final against Roger Federer, his conqueror at that stage last year. Instead of a demoralised Wawrinka, tonight Andy Murray takes on a pumped up Wawrinka. And so here we are, the world No2 against the World No4 under the O2 lights, and it\u2019s winner-takes-all. If Wawrinka wins, he\u2019s through to face Federer tomorrow evening. If Andy Murray wins, he\u2019s through \u2013 and he\u2019ll guarantee that he\u2019s the year-end No2. How exciting! It could go either way and the tension might not have been quite as great if Ferrer had made that serve on Wednesday night. But he didn\u2019t, so here we are, presented with an immensely tough one to call. Wawrinka was poor against Nadal and good in the end against Ferrer. Murray was consistent against Ferrer and he was demolished by Nadal. Going by the rankings, Murray is the favourite, and he\u2019s also got the benefit of home backing. He leads 8-6 in their head-to-head. Yet he\u2019s suffered some traumatic defeats against Wawrinka, a player who knows him so well; they used to hit together, after all, and Murray had to put a stop to that when Wawrinka dumped him put of the US Open in straight sets in 2013. That New York shoeing was their last meeting. Murray went off to have back surgery after that and Wawrinka blossomed into one of the world\u2019s top players, finally making good on his obvious talent by winning his first grand slam when he beat a wounded Nadal in the Australian Open final last year, adding a second at the French Open in June when he ruined Djokovic\u2019s bid for a calendar slam. It\u2019s the raw aggression and fearlessness of Wawrinka against the guile and attrition of Murray, who \u2013 subplot alert! - may well have one eye on next weekend\u2019s Davis Cup final. At the moment, my gut is edging towards Stan the Man. But don\u2019t hold me to that. Murray likes to prove people wrong. Play begins shortly after 8pm GMT."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
