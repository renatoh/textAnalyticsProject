Birmingham's prescience in beginning this process before the financial crash and subsequent budget cuts has given it a head start in becoming the leaner, outcomes-focused authority that is necessary to deliver sustained public service levels while aiming to make savings of \u00a31bn over 10 years. With 48,000 employees and an annual external procurement spend of more than \u00a31bn, Birmingham has the economy of scale to drive through some innovative new ways of delivering services. Its joint venture, or \"strategic partnership\" with Capita is 65% owned by the support services giant (the council has 30%, with the remaining 5% in trust for employees). When the partnership was formed in 2006 it was the largest \"lease\" of local government services in Europe; it remains the spine of the authority's strategy. Stephen Hughes, the council's chief executive, points to the \u00a3244m of savings already made and the \u00a393m of savings secured for each year looking ahead as the irrefutable evidence of the scheme's success. \"Going back to 2003-04, our procurement needed a radical overhaul,\" Hughes says. \"And that's what the programme aimed to do \u2013 a strategy that involved seconding 500 employees to work with Capita in a unique partnership.\" The programme is separated into eight workstreams, each with its own aims, focusing on a different area of council practice. \"Looking at our business practices from the outside was key to achieving efficiencies of this scale,\" says Hughes. \"For example, we moved to holding employee performance records electronically and centrally, which vastly reduced time spent collating and updating them.\" Birmingham's structural reforms have not been made without a human cost, however. In March the authority announced it would need to reduce staffing levels by 7,300 \u2013 about a third of its full-time workforce \u2013 by 2014. It plans to spin off 3,000 mainly back-office roles into a new education co-operative, and 3,300 people have taken or will take voluntary redundancy. But this still leaves a shortfall of about 1,000 staff who may lose their jobs. \"We're at the stage now where the cuts have become so deep that back-office savings are simply not enough,\" says Hughes. \"Our thesis going forward is that the only way to protect service outcomes is to reduce demand for those services \u2013 rather than just picking up the pieces, and the bill, from social problems, we have to invest in early interventions to stop those problems from developing.\" The council has worked closely with the MP Graham Allen, who wrote a report on early intervention strategies, and is hoping to secure \u00a32.5m funding beyond 2012 for its award-winning Be Active scheme, which provides free gym access, swimming and other fitness activities for 300,000 residents."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
