The icy wind howled across the mountain hamlet; homeless families huddled around small fires as temperatures plunged. A few days later the snow retreated again, driven back by returning sunshine. Just a few glistening patches of icy powder remained on the northern slopes. But the reprieve is alarmingly temporary. The blizzards will be back in days or weeks, warned farmer Muhammad Hussain. And next time, there will be no pity. \"We were born here and we love this place,\" he said, gesturing at the magnificent valley sweep. His face was creased with grief from the death of his wife. \"But now we hate the snow.\" The Himalayan winter fired its opening salvo across Pakistan's earthquake zone last week, marking the start of a potentially deadly four-month season for stranded survivors. Although the first snowfall melted in places like Dhana, which is at 7,000 feet, after a few days, night-time temperatures have permanently sunk to as low as -10C. Doctors are now struggling with a surge of cold-related sickness. Medics in Muzaffarabad reported cases of pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. A measles outbreak in a tented camp yesterday killed a 10-month-old boy. And of the tents frantically distributed by aid workers in recent weeks, up to 90% are not \"winterised\". A \"colossal job\" lay ahead, said UN aid coordinator Jan Vandemoortele. \"We remain on a knife's edge,\" he said. More than 87,000 people have died as a result of the October 8 earthquake. Whether fears of a second wave of deaths are realised depends on how quickly aid can get to places like Dhana. Perched on the spine of a mountain ridge, the village seems deceptively close to help. It is just 13 miles from Muzaffarabad, the Kashmiri city that is humming with relief efforts, and takes only 15 minutes to reach by helicopter. It is so close to Muzaffarabad that there is even mobile phone coverage. Yet two months after the October 8 earthquake, Dhana has not received a single tent or blanket. Instead the roads remain cut off, western aid workers are squabbling, and villagers are clinging to their lives. Most live like Hafizullah. The farmer's home is best described as a bunker - a hole 8ft (2.4 metres) wide, covered with wooden beams salvaged from his collapsed house. Hafizullah, who uses one name, cannot even stand up inside. But when the temperature drops to -5C, as it does every night, the bunker is the only option for his wife, two daughters and six sons. \"I know it looks bad, but what do we do?\" he said. \"This is all we have to save ourselves from the cold.\" Some international aid is arriving. The World Food Programme dropped several tonnes of split peas and flour to Dhana last Friday. But shelter was a more hotly disputed matter. Jean-Philippe Bourgeois, an official with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) had just arrived to organise a distribution of tin sheets and other materials. But he had been told to move to another valley, he said, by a French aid agency that had set up camp in the next village. The French group had surveyed the area but not erected any shelters, said Khawaja Nisar Ahmed, a village council official who sided with Mr Bourgeois. Tempers were fraying. \"I thought this was humanitarian work, not egotistical rubbish,\" said Mr Bourgeois. \"This is about politics, about people protecting their patch.\" The Guardian was unable to reach the French organisation for comment. Helicopters have become a vital element of the aid scramble. More than 100 are in the air, according to the UN. On Saturday the World Food Programme pleaded for money to ferry supplies through the winter. \"We have never had a crisis where the use of helicopters was so critical,\" said director James Morris. Meteorologists predict that much of Kashmir and the quake-affected areas of North-West Frontier Province will be snowbound by Christmas. In some places it may be 10 feet deep. Yet in Dhana, almost nobody favoured the alternative - leaving for the camps in lower valleys, below the snow line. Farmers are reluctant to abandon their animals, others are afraid they will lose out on a government compensation scheme which offers 100,000 rupees (\u00a31,000) for every deceased relative. And conservatives were upset at the prospect of sending wives and daughters to a place where other men could see them. The camps were squalid, sinister places, said Abdul Rauf, 36. There were rumours that 300 women had disappeared from camps in Muzaffarabad and Bagh. But as winter tightens its grip, he may be forced to reconsider. Unless more aid arrives quickly, hard choices lie ahead for the people of Dhana - choices of life and death."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
