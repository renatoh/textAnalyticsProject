In a lengthy statement posted to Facebook, Kesha said all she wanted was to be able to make music without being \u201cafraid, scared, or abused\u201d. \u201cThis case has never been about a renegotiation of my record contract \u2013 it was never about getting a bigger, or a better deal,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is about being free from my abuser. I would be willing to work with Sony if they do the right thing and break all ties that bind me to my abuser.\u201d Kesha said that she wants other survivors of abuse to not be afraid to speak out. \u201cUnfortunately I don\u2019t think that my case is giving people who have been abused confidence that they can speak out, and that\u2019s a problem,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I just want to say that if you have been abused, please don\u2019t be afraid to speak out. There are places that will make you feel safe. There are people who will help you. I for one, will stand beside you and behind you. I know now how this all feels and will forever fight for you the way perfect strangers have been fighting for me.\u201d Dr Luke made his first public comments on the case on Monday, denying all the allegations via Twitter. In her statement Kesha thanked her supporters for standing up for her, saying she was \u201cbeyond humbled and thankful\u201d. \u201cOther entertainers who knowingly put their own careers at stake by supporting me, I will be forever grateful,\u201d she wrote. Among the many stars who have publicly supported Kesha is Adele, who, during her acceptance speech for best solo female artist at the Brit Awards on Wednesday said: \u201cI\u2019d also like to take this moment to publicly support Kesha.\u201d Adele is signed to Columbia Records, owned by Sony, the corporation Kesha sued to be released from her contract. Other artists who have spoken out on Kesha\u2019s behalf include Lena Dunham, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Kelly Clarkson, Demi Lovato, Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
