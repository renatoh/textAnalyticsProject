While rivals such as Usher and Akon bang on about their prowess in the boudoir, Ne-Yo has found another route to the heart of his large and appreciative female audience. \"This is officially the Year of the Gentleman,\" he tells us more than once, not forgetting to add that the album of that title - No 2 this week - is in shops now. \"So we're gonna keep it classy, sexy, charming, charismatic.\" And he is as good as his word. There is no swearing in this snappy show - if there is a six-pack under his slick shirt and tie, we never see it, and there are no mating displays with the four lycra-legged Amazons who dance behind him. When he touches one, it is to give her a twirl around the stage that shows off no more than his own fleet-footedness. There may be a roguish tilt to the grey hat that never leaves his head, but on the rest of the evidence, Ne-Yo is a chap who is happy with just a good-night kiss. His voice and songcraft - he has written hits for Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna - are the other half of the package, and keep things cruising along on stage. Ne-Yo is a commanding presence, his yearning voice and romantic lyrics taking fans where they want to go. The influence of his hero, Michael Jackson, is apparent in both the dreaminess of So Sick - a rare ballad in a set packed with dance tunes - and hotshot party confections like Closer. But Miss Independent offers the key to his appeal. Dedicated to \"the kinda woman who doesn't need any help\", it has the crowd rumbling its approval of the loverman with a difference."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
