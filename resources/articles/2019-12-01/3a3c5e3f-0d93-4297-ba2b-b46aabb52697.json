Then it just happened.\u201d Suddenly, Grant felt searing pain across the side of his face. He had been doused with a mixture of boiling water and sugar, known as \u201cnapalm\u201d inside prisons. \u201cI\u2019m glad I was standing side on,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had been standing straight on, I think I probably would\u2019ve lost my sight.\u201d Grant\u2019s successful claim for compensation was among a growing bill for litigation claims paid by the prisons service. Her Majesty\u2019s Prison and Probation Service has paid more than \u00a385m in claims in the last three years, with last year\u2019s bill reaching almost \u00a330m. That bill covers claims for everything, from lost property to attacks against inmates and staff. However, experts said it reflected a system under intense pressure, with some institutions in a state of chaos. Meanwhile, official statistics have repeatedly shown high levels of violence against inmates and officers. \u201cThe story on prison safety is a pretty grim one,\u201d said Nick Davies, from the Institute for Government. \u201cSince 2014-15, incidents have doubled, from around 13,000 to around 25,000, in terms of assaults on prisoners. Assaults on staff have grown even more \u2013 tripling over that same period. So the scale of these payouts certainly doesn\u2019t surprise me or that there seems to have been an increase.\u201d There is little disagreement about the most obvious cause: a huge reduction of staffing under the coalition government. The number of full-time prison officers fell by 27% (6,609) between 2009-10 and 2014-15. The government began to reverse the cuts when problems emerged, but a lot of the experienced staff had already been lost. The number of operational staff with three or more years\u2019 service has fallen by 40% since 2010. \u201cIn March 2019, 50% of officers had less than five years\u2019 experience, compared with 22% in March 2010,\u201d said Davies. While officer numbers have gone back up, there is evidence that prisons have struggled to integrate new staff. \u201cA large number of new recruits are leaving within their first couple of years,\u201d Davies added. Gerard Stilliard, head of personal injury strategy at Thompsons Solicitors, who has been working with prison officers for almost a decade, said it had created a \u201ctotal mismatch\u201d in prisons. \u201cIn really problematic prisons, you had an overwhelming majority of staff with very little experience facing prisoners who, because of the way sentences have gone, are more and more experienced with prison life. It\u2019s the vulnerable prisoners who suffer most directly when there\u2019s a lack of proper control and purposeful activity in a prison.\u201d There are now concerns that the government\u2019s pledges to recruit more police, give more money to prosecutors and apply tougher sentences to some serious offences will make the problems worse. Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \u201cThey don\u2019t know what the consequences will be. The punitive atmosphere created by the rhetoric has knock-on effects in ways that people don\u2019t realise. It will create more overcrowding in our closed prisons, which have the worst conditions.\u201d Davies added: \u201cThe government is nominally committed to improving conditions in prisons, but it doesn\u2019t have a spending plan to deliver that and it hasn\u2019t thought through the consequences of its other policies.\u201d A prison service spokesman said officers were being given body cameras, police-style restraints and incapacitant spray to improve safety. He said \u00a3100m would be spent on improving security, \u00a32.5bn on 10,000 additional prison places and \u00a3156m on pressing maintenance issues. For Grant, the attack on him was the beginning of the end of his prison service career, while its after effects are still with him. \u201cI\u2019m not the person that I used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very wary and very timid now when I never used to be. I was always quite an outgoing person. I don\u2019t like being on my own in places any more. I always want people with me. \u201cWhen I was in the job, we always used to say that it would take something very drastic to make something change. The drastic thing is going to be an officer losing their life.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
