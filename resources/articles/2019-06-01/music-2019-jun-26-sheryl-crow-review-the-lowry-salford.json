Since then, she has sold more than 50m albums and picked up nine Grammys. She has become an environmental and gun law campaigner, is a single adoptive mother (to two small boys, here as her miniature roadies), a breast cancer survivor and is currently home to a brain tumour (thankfully benign). Such traumas seem to have taken her full circle. Although she comments that America is \u201ceffed \u2026 I can\u2019t say the word in front of children\u201d, the smiling Californian plays a two-hour show like she is determined to enjoy every second. Unusually, the set is front-loaded with hit singles, but she seems to relish All I Wanna Do, If It Makes You Happy, Everyday Is a Winding Road and the rest as much as the whooping audience. At 57, Crow \u2013 all tasselled trousers, gym-toned physique, gunslinger guitar stance and honeyed rasp \u2013 isn\u2019t as zeitgeisty as she was, but she just gets better as a live performer. The mammoth setlist careers from grinding country-rock (My Favourite Mistake) to sublime vulnerability (I Shall Believe). She reels off local heroes (\u201cNew Order\u2026 not to be confused with New Edition\u201d) and attempts to heal the Oasis rift (\u201clife\u2019s too short\u201d). She is still coming up with anthems: Still the Good Old Days, co-written with Joe Walsh, is the quinquagenarian All I Wanna Do, a defiant eulogy to \u201chaving fun, at my age\u201d. The singer reckons that forthcoming album Threads will probably be her last, because most people now stream individual songs \u2013 but you wouldn\u2019t bet on it. \u2022 At Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Wednesday, then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
