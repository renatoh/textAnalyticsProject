Mr Taylor, who retired from the top job in June last year at the age of 55, was paid \u00a3587,000 in compensation for loss of office. He was paid a further \u00a3146,000 in salary for the four months of the financial year he worked at the company, plus \u00a35,000 in benefits. He also received \u00a3130,000 plus VAT for consultancy work he did on the Livetime datacasting project until May this year. Mr Taylor - who is entitled to a share of revenues from GWR's partnership deal with BT on an ambitious new mobile service - has yet to be replaced by the company, which has put its chief executive position under review. Simon Ward, the director of new media and digital at GWR who stepped down at the same time as Mr Taylor, was paid \u00a397,000 in compensation as part of a \u00a3173,000 pay packet last year. The report also showed that executive chairman Ralph Bernard was paid a total of \u00a3459,000 in the year to the end of March, made up of \u00a3400,000 salary, a \u00a350,000 bonus and \u00a39,000 in expenses. Steve Orchard, the company's head of local radio who took over the day to day running of the group after Mr Taylor's departure, was paid \u00a3369,000, up by 45% from \u00a3263,000 last year. And finance director Wendy Pallot received \u00a3217,000, around a third more than the \u00a3162,000 she picked up the previous year. GWR will be putting the remuneration report to shareholders at its annual general meeting in London on July 29. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
