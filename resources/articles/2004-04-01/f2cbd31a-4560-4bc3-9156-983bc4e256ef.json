In a rain-affected match Zimbabwe reached 211 for 6 but, when the weather stopped play for the day after 27 overs of Sri Lanka's innings, the tourists were comfortably ahead under the Duckworth/Lewis system. Sangakkara, who hit eight fours in his 72-ball innings, added an unbroken 67 in 12 overs for the fifth wicket with Tillekeratne Dilshan after Sri Lanka had stumbled to 77 for 4. It was the decisive stand of the match. Zimbabwe's innings owed most to a brave unbeaten 96 from Tatenda Taibu, their new captain. Taibu, 20, came to the crease with Zimbabwe 1 for 2 in the third over, after both openers were dismissed without scoring. He added 75 for the sixth wicket with Alester Maregwede (37) and an unbroken 57 in eight overs with Mluleki Nkala, who clubbed Muttiah Muralitharan for two sixes in the last over of the innings. Zimbabwe's total was a lot more respectable than had seemed likely at 79 for 5, but was never likely to trouble a strong Sri Lankan batting line-up. Though Sanath Jayasuriya, Marvan Atapattu and Mahela Jayawardene all failed in an unconvincing display, Sangakkara and Dilshan flexed their muscles at the crucial moment. Sri Lanka were comfortably on course for their revised target, 173 from 33 overs, when the rain came for the final time to confirm their victory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
