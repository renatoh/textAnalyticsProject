Only Arsenal have kept more Premier League clean sheets since his appointment in November, and this performance was further evidence that Pulis has at least got the players at his disposal fighting for all their worth. Pulis's desire for signings this winter has so far remained unfulfilled. Jason Puncheon, the match-winner against Stoke, had appeared the most likely player to end the tranquillity in the transfer window but even his permanent switch to south London is in serious doubt. If the financial restrictions at Palace mean there are to be no major additions in the coming days, Pulis will need this display to be replicated more than once before the end of the season. Stoke supporters will not have forgotten his ability to piece together a well-drilled side that is rarely opened up with ease. Palace displayed those qualities here, denying Pulis's former club the chance to create scoring opportunities or feed Peter Crouch throughout the match, and they were good value for a victory that elevated them off the foot of the table and outside the relegation zone. Yannick Bolasie and Mile Jedinak impressed, with Puncheon taking his chance well shortly after half-time to redeem himself after his dreadful penalty against Tottenham last weekend. Pulis's search for further quality will surely intensify before the end of the month, but his squad certainly provided their manager with some birthday cheer on Saturday. \"We've got good people in the dressing room,\" said Pulis. \"I thought we were good today \u2013 the first half I was disappointed with because we had four or five great opportunities to get amongst them and create chances. We gave the ball away or we made the wrong decisions. \"In the second half if it wasn't for [Jack] Butland's wonderful succession of saves we could have scored two or three goals.\" The Palace manager admitted that while the lack of options up front continues to be an issue, defence will always remain a priority. \"The most difficult thing is getting strikers who score goals week in, week out,\" said Pulis. \"If you do get them they are going to cost you a lot of money, so we need to make sure that we are nice and tight but that we are a threat on the break.\" Palace did not produce an electric performance by any stretch of the imagination but Juli\u00e1n Speroni was rarely troubled. At the other end, Butland produced a number of impressive saves, especially late on, to keep the damage to just one goal. The three points ensured Pulis's side leapfrogged Cardiff, Sunderland, West Ham and Fulham to move up to 16th in the table. Stoke, though, were lacklustre and Oussama Assaidi was guilty of a major error when gifting possession to Puncheon in the 51st minute and allowing the midfielder to shuffle inside and squirm a shot through the legs of Marc Wilson and Ryan Shawcross. How Pulis would love to sign a striker before the window closes, but Stoke have already accomplished that feat. John Guidetti, secured by Mark Hughes on loan from his former club Manchester City, came on for his Potters' debut after 79 minutes and although he failed to make an impact, the Sweden international is hoping for a fruitful spell between now and the end of the season. Guidetti said: \"This was my debut, 10 minutes, and I created one chance. I have my goals' target I want to get by the end of the season. I know I can score goals. But the most important thing is we get Stoke up the table and start winning as a team. \"I want to show I can do more. I think I had too little time [today]. I hope I can come here and prove myself and enjoy my football again.\" Man of the match Jason Puncheon (Crystal Palace)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
