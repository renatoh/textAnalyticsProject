While for Holt, the initial impetus for a piece is invariably visual, it is the sheer vibrancy of the aural impact that grabs the listener and never lets go. In Syrensong, Holt's first piece for symphony orchestra, the piccolo trumpet represents the siren of classical mythology whose seductive powers bewitched unsuspecting mariners. Conductor Thierry Fischer underlined its sense of urgency and ultimately of doom, with moments of colour vividly imprinting themselves along the way. In Minotaur Games \u2013 the 1993 chamber-score recently revised by Holt into a much denser fabric of sound \u2013 the gritty, lurking darkness of the half bull, half man minotaur is powerfully evoked, however the textures were not always heard to best advantage in the resonant confines of Hoddinott Hall. Holt uses instruments in a way which challenges all preconceptions, yet also creates passages magically distilling their essential character. That duality is particularly true of the solo violin writing in the concerto entitled witness to a snow miracle, depicting the martyrdom of the young St Eulalia of Merida torn apart by iron hooks. The music has an extraordinary immediacy, and soloist Chlo\u00eb Hanslip did indeed play with the conviction of one possessed, boosted perhaps by the symbolism of the blood-red soles of her Louboutin shoes. The richness of the Holt's imagery is entirely unselfconscious, though, and over the course of the evening, imbued itself deeply and rewardingly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
