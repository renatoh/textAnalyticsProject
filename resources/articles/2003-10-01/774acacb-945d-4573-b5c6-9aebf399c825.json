And it is expecting to double the circulation tomorrow when the serialisation begins of Burrell's new book, containing the \"explosive\" letters warning someone was planning to sabotage her car brakes to cause an accident that would silence her for good. Mirror editor Piers Morgan said today's increase was achieved without any advance publicity, but with the impact of a dramatic TV campaign tonight he expects extra sales to total 400,000, with the paper's print run set to cater for the extra sales all week. \"Reports of our circulation demise have been greatly exaggerated,\" said Morgan, who went to great lengths to protect the paper's exclusive, issuing an alternative first edition this morning to put rival newspapers off the scent of its story. The Mirror distributed 50,000 copies of a first edition leading with the story of prime minister Tony Blair's heart scare instead of the princess's prediction, an age-old Fleet Street ploy that used to be quite common. In subsequent editions the Mirror devoted nine pages to the letter Princess Diana sent Mr Burrell, complete with photographs of the note and extracts from his forthcoming book. \"This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous,\" wrote the princess in the letter that has come to light six years after her death. \"[Blanked out] is planning \"an accident\" in my car, brake failure and serious head injury in order to make the path clear for Charles to marry.\" The letter was written a year before Diana, her boyfriend Dodi Fayed and chauffeur Henri Paul were killed early on August 31, 1997, when their Mercedes crashed in the Pont D'Alma tunnel in Paris. The Mirror's ruse paid off, as it was able to keep its exclusive deal with Mr Burrell out of the other papers, which would have run the information in their own later editions had they caught sight of it in time. Mr Burrell said he released the letter to the newspaper in the hope it would lead to a British inquest and a \"thorough investigation of the facts by the British authorities\". No date for an inquest has yet been announced. But the publication of the letter also coincides with the publication of Mr Burrell's book, A Royal Duty, extracts of which will be published in the Mirror throughout the week. The Mirror also claims it sold an extra 360,000 copies on Saturday when it gave away a DVD of hit TV series The Office in the paper's first ever poly-bagged edition, a record promotion for the paper under Morgan. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
