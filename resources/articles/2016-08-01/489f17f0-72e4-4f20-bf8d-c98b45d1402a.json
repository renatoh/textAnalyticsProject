But on Tuesday he suggested something even darker and more sinister: that his supporters resolve the issue with guns. Specifically, he suggested that using the constitutional right to bear arms may be the only way to stop Clinton from appointing supreme court justices should she win in November. \u201cIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,\u201d Trump said, before adding: \u201cAlthough the second amendment people \u2013 maybe there is, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Whether Trump was suggesting his supporters use their weaponry against Clinton herself or any liberal judges she might go on to appoint is somewhat open to interpretation. Most people are reading it as the former, but either way it\u2019s unacceptable and a violation of what it means to live in a free democracy. This is a new low even for Trump, who\u2019s been accused of inciting general violence and has verbally attacked individuals from Khizr Khan to Rosie O\u2019Donnell. But he\u2019s never seemed to incite it against individuals \u2013 until now. Gabby Giffords drove home that point and the pernicious effect those words could have on the unstable, in a statement released Tuesday. \u201cWe must draw a bright red line between political speech and suggestions of violence,\u201d she said. \u201cResponsible, stable individuals won\u2019t take Trump\u2019s rhetoric to its literal end, but his words may provide a magnet for those seeking infamy. They may provide inspiration or permission for those bent on bloodshed.\u201d Those words have special meaning coming from Giffords, whose time in political office was cut short by an assassination attempt that left six dead; she survived but with a critical gunshot wound to the head. Now Trump is pulling the tricks he always does when he says something beyond the pale politically. He\u2019s blaming the media for getting it wrong. Before when he\u2019s implicitly encouraged or used the language of violence \u2013 at rallies when he\u2019s told supporters if they punch a protester he\u2019ll pay the legal bills, or at campaign stops when he\u2019s boasted murder wouldn\u2019t drive his supporters away \u2013 he\u2019s walked it back as just another quirky part of his humor. \u201cObviously it was a joke,\u201d he later said of the murder brag. Trump\u2019s already spinning this newest threat, saying he meant that second amendment supporters could still stop Clinton\u2019s election \u2013 by voting, sillies! But that line, like much of his campaign rhetoric, is pure bullshit. While there\u2019s some wiggle room in other parts of his statement what\u2019s not up for debate is that he was talking about Clinton\u2019s powers after the election, if she wins \u2013 \u201cif she gets to pick her judges\u201d. You can\u2019t stop someone from winning democratically if they\u2019ve already won a democratic election \u2013 you have to do it criminally, and specifically, according to the rest of Trump\u2019s quote, using \u201cthe second amendment\u201d. I\u2019ve no doubt that it\u2019s an unequivocal call for the use of gun violence to upend democracy and one for which Trump should not be given the benefit of the doubt. Even more stunning than any of Trump\u2019s stunningly unpresidential behavior is that not every Republican has run straight for the hills. He even had backup from that Republican mainstay organization known as the National Rifle Association, which tweeted its support for his initial statement even as it altered its meaning by claiming Trump said if Clinton gets to pick supreme court judges, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d This is not party politics as usual. This goes beyond mere polarization or the other ills of Washington. It\u2019s an attack on democracy that\u2019s as personal as it is politically vile. Trump was talking in thinly veiled terms about the most personal kind of attack there is \u2013 an attack on the body and specifically, an attack on the body of the first female president. The gendered element of it isn\u2019t lost on party leaders. Elizabeth Warren didn\u2019t mince words on Twitter this evening, saying Donald Trump\u201cmakes death threats because he\u2019s a pathetic coward who can\u2019t handle the fact that he\u2019s losing to a girl.\u201d Rebecca Traister has written brilliantly on the long history of powerful men like Trump who would delegitimize the ascent of women and minorities. But this \u2013 to have the nominee of a major party appear to encourage his supporters to assassinate his opponent \u2013 is unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before, quite likely for the simple reason that we\u2019ve never had a woman this close to the White House steps. Just as the birther movement that Trump helped lead was thinly veiled racism rooted in the belief that a black man couldn\u2019t possibly legitimately be the president, Trump\u2019s insistence that \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d has \u201cstolen\u201d the election thrives among those who are angry that power could be taken from them by a woman, and specifically this one. It\u2019s vulgar, un-American and undemocratic. And it was only a matter of time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
