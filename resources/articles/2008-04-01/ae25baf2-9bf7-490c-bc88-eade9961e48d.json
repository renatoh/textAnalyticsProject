Annaud seems in his element in the middle ages, directing with a real feel for a time that was both brutish and high-minded. And Sean Connery revels in his role as William of Baskerville, the Franciscan sleuth who sets out to decipher the deadly secret of the library. Shaft 10.40pm, Film4 (John Singleton, 2000) A super-cool, Armani-clad Samuel L Jackson plays the nephew of 70s black private eye John Shaft in this slick but uninspired updating of the best of the blaxploitation movies. Jackson's Shaft is out to bring sadistic killer Christian Bale to book for a racist murder; the original Shaft, Richard Roundtree, makes a guest appearance, and more importantly, the Isaac Hayes theme song is back. Casanova 12.10am, Sky Movies Drama (Lasse Hallstru\u00f6m, 2005) A none-too seductive telling of the legendary lover's adventures, but as a lively, comical historical romp it's attractive enough. The late Heath Ledger is Casanova, pursued by inquisitor Jeremy Irons and bedding all and sundry in the quest to find true love, with Sienna Miller the prime candidate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
