His election on Wednesday should have been a crowning glory for Michel Platini, the former king of France as a player and a manager, the president of Uefa from 2007 where Infantino was the general secretary, then candidate to succeed Sepp Blatter for the Fifa presidency until both presidents were banned from football in 2015. Now, in the capital of the country where he became accustomed always to ascending throughout a brilliant career, he is reduced to raging from outside the congress hall. Meeting a group of journalists from six European countries at a hotel affording views of the Eiffel Tower, Platini raged against Blatter, against Infantino for stepping over him to become the president and barely talking to him since, against Fifa and against the Swiss establishment, which Platini denounced as having plotted to manipulate his fall. In the buildup to the women\u2019s World Cup, which kicks off in France on Friday, Platini even lobbed in an accusation that Infantino, in their time together at Uefa, never supported women\u2019s football. \u201cHe was not a fan of women\u2019s football,\u201d Platini said. \u201cHe was laughing at women\u2019s football; he is not a believer in it.\u201d A source close to Infantino rejected that accusation, describing it as \u201cpathetic\u201d. Platini, having served three and a half years of a four-year ban from all football activities for receiving a 2m Swiss francs (\u00a31.35m) payment from Fifa, on Blatter\u2019s orders, in 2011, is still claiming he has no regrets, does not accept it was irregular or that he did anything improper. It was, he says, all a plot initiated to stop him becoming the president, after he fell out with Blatter in 2013 when Blatter reversed one of his promises to step down and said he would stand again two years later. Platini is taking legal action on four fronts: in September, he mounted a criminal case in Paris for defamation and false accusation, against people he will not name publicly. In Switzerland, he has taken out a criminal case against the former spokesman for the Fifa ethics committee when it pursued the case against Platini, claiming he defamed him with false allegations about the seriousness of the \u00a31.35m payment. The former spokesman has denied making the comments attributed to him in press reports. Platini has a further case in Switzerland against the spokesman for the attorney general, claiming his role was also exaggerated \u2013 although it was made clear from the beginning that the \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d applied to both fallen presidents. The Swiss attorney general\u2019s office confirmed that \u201ca supervisory complaint\u201d had been received but said it had been rejected. Most importantly, Platini said, he has taken a case to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg, arguing he was wrongly deprived of his right to work by being banned from the game that had always been his life and profession. He is also arguing he was deprived of the right to a fair trial, and that the case was retrospective, because Fifa made the payment to him in 2011 but began ethics committee proceedings in 2015 after he had declared his candidacy to be Fifa president. Platini and Blatter claimed the payment was back pay owed from an \u201coral agreement\u201d between the two men when Platini worked as Fifa\u2019s football adviser, a four-year stint that had ended in 2002, nine years before the money was paid. The ethics committee rejected that as \u201cnot convincing\u201d, and classed it as an unethical payment. It said at the time there was insufficient evidence to establish \u201cto the extent required\u201d that the payment was a bribe for Platini, as the Uefa president, to support Blatter in the election four months later in June 2011, which Platini did. Fifa\u2019s appeals committee upheld the decision, then Platini followed agreed football procedures and took his case to the court of arbitration for sport. Three professors hearing the case were unimpressed with Platini\u2019s justification, pointedly citing the proximity of Blatter\u2019s Fifa election and saying they were \u201cnot convinced by the legitimacy of the \u00a31.35m payment\u201d. The Cas panel consisted of three distinguished professors of law from Italy, France and Belgium but Platini included the court in his argument that his fall was a Swiss plot to get him. He says he learned of the alleged plot when he gave what would be his final press conference as the Uefa president, before the Champions League draw in Monaco in August 2015: \u201cSomebody [whom he did not name] came to me and said: \u2018Beware Michel; they are looking for something against you at Fifa.\u2019\u201d Still, despite the view taken throughout the process including at Cas, he insists it was legitimate to ask for the money, that Blatter had agreed to pay him 1m Swiss francs a year but said at that time he could only pay him 300,000, which was written into the contract. He had contacted Blatter in 2010 and been asked to send an invoice, which he did. \u201cDo you think, with all the money I earned throughout my career that I would kill my story for 2m Swiss francs?\u201d he says. \u201cIf Blatter had said they couldn\u2019t pay me for some reason, that would have been fine. About asking for the money \u2013 I have no regrets at all.\u201d He says Infantino was loyal enough to him when they worked together but that after Platini\u2019s ban Infantino came to see him and said he would stand for the Fifa presidency to ensure a Uefa candidate won. Platini feels betrayed by that and the lack of contact since. \u201cI cannot imagine what I did for Gianni Infantino that he had a bad behaviour towards me,\u201d Platini said. \u201cAfter what I did for him, he did something against me. \u201cThe last time I talked to him was on the plane in 2016 when I went to Athens to say auf wiedersehen to the Uefa congress. He came to shake my hand. I said: \u2018You shake my hand?\u2019 I was very cold with him and I haven\u2019t spoken to him for three years. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t legitimacy to be the president of Fifa. I\u2019m sure he is a good legal guy and secretary general but how can somebody who vomited against Fifa all day every day become the president?\u201d Of his plans when the ban concludes in October, Platini said he did not know whether there is any way back into football. His former general secretary, who ascended to the top job when both presidents were felled, will be crowned again on Wednesday, at a conference hall on Platini\u2019s home turf."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
