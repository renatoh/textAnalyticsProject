Kuf is ruled by the native aliens, and the brother of the king schemes to overthrow him with the help of the Macht. The bulk of the novel is the story of the ensuing bloody battles and the figures, both human and alien, caught up in them. It's a brilliant study of warfare and how individuals formulate a sense of honour, as well as being compulsively readable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
