Kicking off in a police cell, the film tells us how our hero, Oscar (Kyrre Hellum), ended up beneath an obese stripper's dead body in a porn shop bloodbath. The violence seems tonally familiar; the humour (there's a faint Full Monty feel to the backstory about how three ex-cons go awry after winning the lottery) is a less easy fit. It lays on lashings of crim-bickering and jauntily scored arterial spurting when all you can stomach is some crispbread."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
