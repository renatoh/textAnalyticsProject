This seems unwarranted: while the president\u2019s son-in-law is certainly a joker, he lacks the charisma needed for supervillain status. Indeed, the man lacks any charisma whatsoever; he has the presence of a piece of plywood. In many ways, Kushner\u2019s wooden demeanour has been his greatest strength: it has helped him fly under the radar. Politics has become a reality TV show and quiet Kushner is often too boring to bother with; it is far more interesting to focus on his glamorous wife, Ivanka Trump, or his garrulous father-in-law. Yet over the past few years Kushner has managed to insert himself into the highest levels of decision-making while largely remaining behind the scenes. That changed last week. On Thursday, Kushner, who has taken on vast responsibilities in the Trump administration\u2019s response to Covid-19, made his first public appearance at the White House daily coronavirus briefing. His moment in the spotlight seemed to serve as a wakeup call for the US. All of a sudden, it was glaringly obvious how dangerous Kushner\u2019s hubris is. \u201cI for one became even more fearful of [Covid-19] when I saw how inept\u201d Kushner is, said the Republican pundit Meghan McCain on Monday. McCain\u2019s fears were widely shared. Kushner was supposedly at the press briefing to explain the work he has been doing. However, despite him repeating the word '\u201cdata\u201d 13 times, it quickly became clear that he has no idea what he is doing. He doesn\u2019t even seem to know what the purpose of a federal stockpile of medical equipment is. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be our stockpile,\u201d he explained haughtily to reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d Kushner\u2019s bizarre statement stunned people. Who did the guy think that the federal stockpile belongs to if not the United States of America? The first family and their friends? Kushner may as well have stood up there and said: \u201cWe\u2019re not in this together \u2013 you\u2019re on your own.\u201d An opinion column in the New York Times the following day declared: Jared Kushner Is Going to Get Us All Killed. (The headline was later changed, for reasons unknown, to Putting Jared Kushner In Charge Is Utter Madness.) During his 39 years on Earth, Kushner has continuously failed upwards. Despite being an unremarkable student, he got a place at Harvard; according to spokespeople for Kushner Companies, this was unrelated to his dad giving $2.5m to the university. After buying a skyscraper at the very top of the real estate market, Kushner was miraculously bailed out by a company with links to the government of Qatar \u2013 just months before a potentially ruinous $1.4bn mortgage was due. Wherever Kushner is, questionable deals, questionable ethics and a crowd of yes men seem to follow. The world is constantly remade to reflect the reality that he wants to see. Indeed, shortly after the backlash to Kushner\u2019s comments about the federal stockpile, the government\u2019s website appeared to change to more closely reflect Kushner\u2019s assertions. According to a spokesperson, this change had been in the works for ages; it was nothing to do with Kushner\u2019s ego. There is a management concept called the Peter principle. The world is full of inept managers, this theory postulates, because people are promoted until they rise to \u201ctheir level of incompetence\u201d. Bearing that in mind, let me introduce the Kushner corollary: the idea that a handful of mediocre middle managers, through a combination of privilege and luck, manage to rise way beyond their level of incompetence to a point where their hubris poses a serious threat to the world. It is becoming increasingly clear that Kushner is not just a doofus \u2013 he is dangerous.
