They have a Burmese cat that wakes the pair up at half past four to be fed, named Bubbles because it is \u201cchampagne coloured\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s funny because my first car, when I was 18, was \u2018champagne coloured\u2019,\u201d Barnett says, over the phone from her hometown. It isn\u2019t a phrase she\u2019d normally use for a beat-up 87 Holden Astra, but that\u2019s how the car was described when she spotted it online. \u201cI\u2019d never heard someone use the word \u2018champagne\u2019 in reference to a colour.\u201d It sounds like the seeds of a new Barnett ditty: \u201cThey called my Holden Astra \u2018champagne coloured\u2019 in the car ad / must have been real loved to write poetry like that.\u201d Barnett plucks details from her life as if they were flowers, pressing them gently into her songs: a nice lady next door who talks of green beds; roadkill she calls \u201cpossum Jackson Pollock\u201d; and the house in Preston with \u201ca photo of a young man in a van in Vietnam\u201d. Her last single, Nobody Really Cares if You Don\u2019t Go to the Party, spins art out of debating whether to go out or not (\u201cI\u2019d rather stay in bed with the rain over my head / Than have to pick my brain up off of the floor\u201d). She says it\u2019s important to take note of the small things. \u201cIt\u2019s not in order to write a good song; it\u2019s to pay respect to the amazing things that are going on. I write a lot of poetry I never even show anyone. It\u2019s just to keep track of the beautiful things that happen, and the not so beautiful things.\u201d At the end of last year Barnett discovered she had been nominated for best new artist at the upcoming 2016 Grammys \u2013 much to the surprise of the live US audience. Her debut album Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit wound up in a number of best-of lists, including top 10 albums as chosen by the Guardian, Rolling Stone and Pitchfork. It capped off a big year for Barnett: she had performed on Ellen, recorded with Jack White in Nashville and toured the world. But Barnett deftly sidesteps any rags-to-riches narrative. Be it running her own label Milk! Records (which releases a compilation next month), writing songs or making art, she says she\u2019s still learning. \u201cI tend to look at the smaller picture a bit more. We\u2019ve done so much travel and crazy stuff in the last couple of years, but I\u2019m still trying to write a good song, trying to draw a good picture. I\u2019m pretty basic, I guess.\u201d After a year of sharing festival stages with some of the biggest names in music including Sharon Van Etten, Lana Del Rey and Kendrick Lamar, did any performance trigger a lighting bolt moment in regards to her own work? \u201cI\u2019m very impressionable, so I have that feeling a lot,\u201d she answers. She recalls watching Neil Young perform at Way Home festival in Ontario, Canada. \u201cI started crying the minute he started playing. I never do that and it was this really, really intense thing. Maybe I was really tired from touring, but it just brought up so much stuff.\u201d She has also been inspired by a few rock memoirs of late. \u201cI read Carrie Brownstein\u2019s book [of Sleater-Kinney], the new Patti Smith book and [music critic] Jessica Hopper\u2019s book all in a small period of time and felt really inspired and empowered in life.\u201d Perhaps as a result, Barnett has been reflecting on how we create an idea of people \u2013 particularly musicians \u2013 in our minds, and how for better or for worse reality so often diverges. \u201cPeople do it to me,\u201d she says. Barnett has a tendency to speak with caveats. She circles back on her statements and tacks on an addendum. When she admits it is difficult to focus or find time to write new material on the road, she immediately chastises herself for making excuses. \u201cWhen I\u2019m on tour I say, \u2018I have no time to write, I\u2019m not coming up with any ideas,\u2019 but when I find spare time I find anything to distract myself so I can\u2019t write.\u201d It is an all-too-human tendency Barnett traces back to art school in her early 20s. \u201cI didn\u2019t do my art stuff; I wrote songs instead. I always find something to distract myself from what\u2019s right in front of me.\u201d Her solution has been to try and write \u201ca little bit, every day\u201d, without expectation. Some songs come to her \u201creally quick\u201d, while others have taken up for four years to finish. When her head gets caught up in a chase for perfection she tries to head to the countryside, read books, cook food and go for big walks \u2013 basically, \u201cdo anything except stress out about this thing that only I really care about. Nobody is telling me to write songs.\u201d Most often, that is when her great ideas come: \u201cYou need a bit of reset, to step outside and look back at what you\u2019re doing.\u201d \u2022 Courtney Barnett headlines Sugar Mountain festival on 23 January and Twilight at Taronga on 28 January before touring Canada and the US; Milk!
