Do not read unless you have watched season two, episode two There\u2019s just one small skank in the skud pie ... \u2013 Peli Motto A song of sand and ice this week, as Din Djarin and his priceless consignment leave Tatooine and spend a few dicey hours on an icy planet. It\u2019s an episode that shows off the vast array of life and threats to life that exist within the galaxy. It also provides striking evidence of the thermal qualities of Beskar metal. There\u2019s danger, too, from ugly creatures and from unshaven enforcers of the Republic alike. In the end, everyone emerges just about unscathed, though there\u2019s another expensive trip to the garage on the horizon. The action begins where it left off last week, with Mando and Baby Yoda en route back to Mos Eisley after killing the Krayt dragon and bagging some free barbecue. A tripwire in the sand soon catches their speeder in full glide, however, and a heist is in train. Mando deals with the first two assailants with a wrestling clothesline, but the third must be negotiated with. The bandit wants the Baby, but Mando points out that\u2019s not a good idea. \u201cIf you put one mark on him there is nowhere you will be able to hide from me\u201d, is the precise phrase, and negotiations move on to the little robber man (a Jawa in breathing equipment?) getting Mando\u2019s jet pack instead. The exchange takes place, but as we all know, jet packs are machines with a mind of their own, and within seconds of launching into the sky, the bandit drops out of it and crumples into the sand. It\u2019s a funny piece of choreography from this week\u2019s director, Ant-Man\u2019s Peyton Reed, and there\u2019s a streak of visual comedy that runs through the entire episode \u2013 even when the massive ice spiders are about. But before all that happens, Mando must first accept another passenger, a Frog Woman who knows where the Mandalorians are hiding, but wants to deliver a cargo of precious eggs to the same location. Off the Razor Crest goes, but problems are never far behind. Not only do two X-wing pilots show up in space, suspicious of the ship\u2019s bonafides, but Baby Yoda has decided that the Frog Woman\u2019s eggs are an ideal snack. With regards to the latter problem, Mando hopes that positive reinforcement of the message \u201cdo not eat the eggs\u201d will be enough. As regards the former, a more complicated response is required, and a space chase through a neighbouring planet ensues. The planet is frozen, with deep ravines, emerald blue air and loads of nodules on the surface that look like the things that give birth to xenomorphs in Alien. So they\u2019re fine, obviously. To cut a long story short, Mando and co elude the X-wings by crash-landing in a cave, which in turn collapses and damages the ship in the process. While Mando tries to fix a hole in the hull, Frog Woman wanders off for a mineral bath with her eggs. When Yoda finds out, it sets off an eggy craving, but with Frog Woman keeping them tight in a jar he has to make do with nibbling on nodules instead. Of course, that is bad news because, the nodules contain baby ice spiders and there are also mid-size ice spiders, large ice spiders and a monstrous mummy ice spider hidden just around the corner. The action that follows is of the sort you usually get in a zombie movie, with ever more ice spiders slowly overwhelming our heroes, despite Mando\u2019s expertise with the blaster. You begin to wonder how a happy ending could possibly result, and a bit of Baby Yoda Force majeure seems the only option. But then there\u2019s the sound of bleeping and the red beams of Republic blasters flash into view. The same cops who wanted to arrest Mando have now been made aware of some good behaviour during last season\u2019s jailbreak and will help him out of this bind, provided he gets his transponder fixed (the galactic equivalent of a failed break light). The Razor Crest takes off, heading to Trask in search of repairs, and everyone breathes a big sigh of relief. All except Baby Yoda, that is, who\u2019s got a hidden egg to scoff down while no one\u2019s looking. The moral of the story Nothing is more important than family. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving Frog Woman to dash to a dangerous planet with a jar of eggs in tow. She wants to be reunited with her husband and to procreate (how frog IVF works, I don\u2019t want to know). Meanwhile, mama massive ice spider gets her protective instincts provoked by the gang\u2019s nodule noodling. Hell hath no fury like an arachnid outraged. And finally there\u2019s the developing relationship between Din Djarin and Baby Yoda. No longer just a protector, Mando is having to teach his charge right and wrong, too, specifically in the area of Frog Egg consumption. Whether the kid is listening is another matter, but that\u2019s the joy of parenting for you. Featured creatures Looking through the \u201camphibian\u201d creature subset of Wookieepeedia leaves me no clearer as to quite what type of Frog Woman our Frog Woman actually is. We also meet some lovely ice spiders, and an insect creature with a jaw as long as its arm. Cameo corner Richard Ayoade gets to resume his voice role as Zero, the droid who was desperate to overheat the Razor Crest in his role as getaway pilot in last season\u2019s prison heist. Here, Frog Woman shows she\u2019s not just any old amphibian by rerouting Zero\u2019s \u201cvocabulator\u201d allowing him to speak on her behalf. Baby Yoda watch As mentioned above, the kid is acting up. He won\u2019t be confined to his room, he won\u2019t sit in his chair, he certainly won\u2019t stop eating Frog Eggs. His strong will and curiosity is increasingly a combination that\u2019s getting Mando into trouble . But without trouble there\u2019s no adventure, and let\u2019s face it, the little hairy ball of snot remains irresistibly cute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
