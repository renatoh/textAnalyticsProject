The engine is running. My go-between keeps checking the wing mirror for any sign of the man we have come to meet. After Israel's assassination of around 150 prominent militants during the last three years of the Palestinian intifada (uprising), no leader of an armed faction takes chances - even in the heartlands of the occupied territories. As the minutes pass, my contact seems edgy. \"The problem isn't just that the Israelis may attack while we are in the meeting,\" he says. \"Sometimes they attack immediately after you have left - and then the groups may suspect you of tipping them off.\" Eventually, a car drives by, does an abrupt u-turn and signals to us to follow. We tail it across the impoverished urban sprawl, stopping outside a bland-looking workshop. On the first floor, we are ushered first into a waiting room, lined with golden sofas in the Islamist style, and finally into a small office. Seated behind a desk, flanked by the Palestinian flag and a black and gold banner, is Nafiz Azzam, leader of Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip. The Islamist group is often regarded as the most extreme of the Palestinian armed resistance organisations, notorious for suicide attacks against Israeli targets, both civilian and military. But in his manner at least, Azzam turns out to be the image of bookish moderation, as he reflects on the failure of the Palestinian armed factions to agree a new ceasefire - or hudna. \"We want to minimise the suffering of our people, avoid internal Palestinian conflict and demonstrate that we are not an obstacle to achieving a settlement.\" But, referring to the breakdown of last summer's two-month unilateral Palestinian ceasefire after repeated Israeli killings of activists, he adds: \"Israel violated and abandoned it. This time we asked whether there were any guarantees on offer from the other side and were told no. So it was very difficult to expect us to agree a hudna for free. We know the balance of power is not in our favour, but we will not allow that to force us to surrender.\" When challenged to justify attacks on civilians, Azzam seems almost apologetic, citing a string of Israeli massacres and killings of civilians - from the slaughter of the villagers of Deir Yassin in 1948 to the shooting of 12-year-old Muhammad Durrah in his father's arms at the beginning of the current al-Aqsa intifada in 2000. \"We are never happy about the death of any innocent human being, regardless of their religion, but Israel initiated these killings. Palestinians were pushed into such operations in an effort to stop Israel killing our civilians. A year ago, Islamic Jihad proposed that both sides avoid civilian targets - and that was recently repeated by Hamas - but the Israelis have not responded positively.\" After dark, we go in search of Abd al-Aziz Rantissi, political leader and co-founder of Hamas, the largest Islamist resistance group and the only force among the Palestinians to offer a serious challenge to the leadership of Yasser Arafat and his nationalist Fatah movement. That is especially true in the Gaza Strip, where its support is rooted in a network of social welfare and educational institutions among the poorest of a destitute population. Since Israel launched an abortive assassination attempt against him in June last year, Rantissi, a 56-year-old paediatrician, has gone underground, never moving around outside in daylight. Arrangements are made by word of mouth in the shadows of Gaza's bomb-cratered buildings, to avoid Israeli electronic surveillance. We are told to wait at an office block for further instructions. Suddenly, Rantissi himself appears with two armed bodyguards, joking about his chances of survival if he had agreed to appear on a live satellite TV talk show that night. The Hamas leader is more outspoken than Azzam - a natural politician, restless and sharp-tongued. He pulls up his left trouser leg to reveal a livid red scar running up his calf to his thigh, where his artery was severed in last June's attack. Rantissi was being driven through Gaza by his son and a bodyguard when their Jeep was attacked by two Israeli helicopter gunships with a barrage of missiles. The bodyguard was killed, along with a woman and her eight-year-old daughter passing by. His son was left paralysed in every limb and 25 bystanders were wounded. But Rantissi staggered free, as he puts it, \"through a sea of blood\" - convinced that his son's precaution of not stopping at junctions and red lights (\"the police always wave us through\") had saved his life. Behind the scenes, Palestinian leaders have for months been trying to draw Hamas into agreeing a common national platform. But Rantissi - who has spent more than two years in Palestinian jails, as well as seven in Israeli prisons, for his role as a Hamas leader - warns that his organisation will be offering no more comprehensive ceasefires without a full Israel withdrawal. \"We are resisting because we are under occupation,\" he declares, \"not because we are being hit by Apaches or F16s. The enemy must withdraw or they will continue to bleed. But if the occupation ends, there will be no need for resistance.\" Although militants from Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Fatah-linked al-Aqsa Brigades and leftwing groups such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestinian (PFLP) continue to battle it out with Israeli troops in and around the refugee camps and towns of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the number of attacks on Israeli cities has fallen sharply in recent months. But Rantissi rebuffs any suggestion that the unremitting Israeli onslaught has left Hamas enfeebled and hungry for a face-saving respite. \"It is completely untrue. There has been no political decision to halt our attacks. It is normal that there are waves of resistance and then periods of relative quiet. But now the street is calling for action.\" Mostly relaxed, the Hamas leader becomes incensed when confronted with the revulsion of western public opinion over Islamist suicide bombings of Israeli buses and bars - like Azzam, defending the tactic as a deterrent which has gone some way to shift the \"balance of suffering\". \"The number of Palestinian children killed by the Israelis in the past three years is almost as high as the total number of Israeli deaths. These operations have only one target - to deter the killing of our children and civilians. If they stop killing our civilians, we will stop. But what kind of international public opinion is it that averts its eyes from Israeli F16s but protests at us fighting the occupiers?\" Nor is he prepared to concede that suicide attacks have poisoned Palestinian culture. \"We do not have a cult of death,\" he insists, \"we have a cult of dignity - as you have seen they also do in Iraq.\" More unexpected than Rantissi's defence of what many Palestinians themselves regard as unjustifiable is the attitude of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders towards the prospect of a two-state settlement of the conflict. Both groups are usually regarded as beyond the political pale outside the Muslim world, not only because of their use of suicide bombers, but also because of their long-term goal of establishing Islamist rule in the whole of historic Palestine. Unlike the secular resistance, it is often assumed, the Islamists will never accept peace with Israel. What emerges from any discussion which goes beyond slogans and soundbites, however, is something different - and potentially crucial to any settlement of the conflict. In practical terms, it becomes clear, both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are now committed to ending their armed campaign in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967: the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem. \"From a religious point of view,\" the animated Rantissi explains, \"we can't give up our land. But we are ready to accept a temporary solution that does not confiscate Palestinian rights: the occupier should withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange for a ceasefire that should be seen in terms of years.\" Azzam is, if anything, more explicit. A Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza is of course not the limit of Islamic Jihad's long-term \"ambition\". But, he goes on, \"we may accept a Palestinian state with full jurisdiction in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, with full Palestinian security and without Israeli settlements. That is the realistic situation. We may accept it temporarily, even though our belief is that historic Palestine is our right. If we are not able today to reclaim it, that is because of the international complications and the unfair balance of power. We don't know how long this temporary solution might be. But if it comes about, many things might change in the whole region.\" The Islamists' carefully-hedged accommodation to the goal of a Palestinian state in the 1967 territories is echoed even more strongly by groups like the Marxist PFLP, which were once at the heart of the rejectionist opposition to a two-state solution. Jamil Majdalawi, PFLP leader in Gaza, explains: \"A democratic state for all in the whole of Palestine is a hope for history, but we don't regard it as a realistic proposal now. The confrontation now is about the area of the Palestinian state, its sovereignty and borders.\" What these comments make clear is that every significant Palestinian political and armed force is, for the first time, now prepared to accept a de facto end to conflict in return for a fully independent state on only 22% of pre-1948 Palestine. This is unprecedented in the history of the conflict. But, of course, no such state is on offer. And what is currently taking place on the ground has begun to cast doubt on whether a Palestinian state is now a realistic possibility at all. Since most of their people fled or were driven from their homes in the war that gave birth to the state of Israel in 1948, the Palestinians have suffered national dispossession, humiliation and slaughter. And as their country has been progressively conquered and colonised - with the support or acquiescence of the west - their daily lives have become ever grimmer. Yet they have also consistently demonstrated a tenacious creativity in their struggle for political survival and independence. A quarter of a century ago, when I first visited the region, there were no suicide bombers and Palestinian Islamists were an exotic rarity - Islamism flourished later in the vacuum left by the failures of nationalists and leftists. The Palestinian resistance, then based in Beirut, was the focus of a dynamic popular movement, which offered political hope both to the Palestinian diaspora and those living under Israeli occupation. Now, two decades after Yasser Arafat and the PLO were forced out of Lebanon, the conditions of Palestinian refugees left behind have deteriorated calamitously. Having survived 15 years of civil war, 22 years of Israeli occupation of the south and orgies of killing by Syrian and Israeli backed militias in camps such as Tel al-Za'atar and Shatila, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians now subsist on the margins of Lebanese society, prevented from working in 72 specified jobs and banned from owning or inheriting property. \"They're trying to force the Palestinians out of Lebanon with their racist laws,\" says Sultan Abu al-Ainain, Fatah's military commander in south Lebanon, who has been confined to the Rashidiyeh refugee camp near Tyre for the past five years. \"But our suffering has not put a limit on our ambitions.\" At least inside Rashidiyeh, blockaded by the Lebanese army, the Palestinian political organisations can organise, which they cannot in most of Lebanon. In the 1970s, the PLO and its factions provided employment and welfare support, ran workshops, clinics and cultural centres. Their expulsion left their people pauperised, and today camps like Shatila and Ain el-Helweh in Sidon look more like the slums of Karachi or Dhaka. Shatila's Gaza Hospital, once the pride of the Palestinian Red Crescent, is now a tenement squat, teeming with homeless families, its medical equipment long ago looted by Lebanese militia. Refugees' attitudes vary from despairing resignation to enraged militancy - as one Shatila activist, Ahmad Halimi, puts it,\"Our people are living in a dark tunnel.\" In the occupied Palestinian territories themselves, conditions have if anything deteriorated even more precipitously. During the glacial \"peace process\" kicked off by the Oslo accord of 1993, Israeli city closures and exclusion of Palestinian workers led to a 40% drop in living standards and sharp increases in unemployment. But since the explosion of the intifada in September 2000, that slump has turned into a full-scale economic and social disaster, as military invasion, siege, blockades, curfews and destruction of homes and infrastructure have driven Palestinian unemployment to two-thirds in some parts of the territories, where incomes have fallen by more than half to $900 a year - compared with an average of nearly $17,000 for their Israeli neighbours. Towns dependent on tourism, like Bethlehem, have been reduced to beggary, while towering over shanty refugee camps are the suburban-style fortresses that are home to nearly 240,000 Jewish settlers. Only in South Africa and on the US-Mexican border do the first and third worlds collide as in the territories ruled by Israel. The bitter reality is that the Israeli occupation was less oppressive and destructive when it took the form of direct military rule up until the early 1990s than it is today. Despite the humiliation of foreign subjugation and the routine imprisonment of activists, for the first 20 years after the 1967 war, life was easier for the average Palestinian, who could work in Israel, trade and move relatively freely across the country. Even the illegal colonisation of the West Bank and Gaza by Israeli settlers was on a modest scale compared with what would come later. To anyone who knew the area in those years, the sweeping transformation of the occupied territories is immediately obvious on the road from the Jordanian border to Jerusalem, where the \"settlement\" of Ma'ale Adumim is now a city of tens of thousands dominating the hills approaching the Israeli-annexed capital and the Arab suburbs of Bethany and Abu Dis are walled off behind 30-feet-high concrete barriers from a city most of their inhabitants are no longer even able to visit. \"My 12-year-old son asked me this morning: are you going to accept to live in these ghettoes?\" Muhammad Jaradat of the refugee rights organisation Badil recounts. \"The truth is most Israelis would leave if they had to live as we do.\" The wall dividing Jerusalem from its Arab suburbs is part of the so-called \"separation fence\", which far from protecting Israel proper from vengeful West Bankers, in fact cuts deep into occupied territory - already up to 7km from the old Israeli border and planned to reach 21km at some points - linking up settlements with Israel, but trapping tens of thousands of Palestinians on the Israeli side. These areas, between the old green line and the wall, are declared \"closed zones\", where Palestinian residents must apply for a permit to live or work and where farmers are often cut off from their land. In the case of Qalqilya, the entire town has now been walled up, with access only possible through one Israeli checkpoint. A third of Qalqilya's shops have closed and 3,000 out of its population of 40,000 have left - some to Jordan and the Gulf - while hundreds queue up for food handouts every day. Palestinians are convinced that what they call the \"apartheid wall\", which according to leaked plans will eventually enclose about 57% of the West Bank in a series of sealed cantons, is designed to grab more land for the settlements and encourage a slow-burn Palestinian exodus by making daily life impossible. As a newly-retired Israeli general who headed the civil administration in the West Bank and Gaza told me: \"Of course the wall is not a security wall - it's a political wall.
