The song, produced by Cat Empire vocalist Felix Riebl in conjunction with the Marliya singers from the Gondwana Indigenous Children\u2019s Choir, will be released officially on Wednesday but has been shared with Guardian Australia. It tells the story of Dhu\u2019s 45 hours in custody at South Hedland police station, Western Australia, before her death from septicemia and pneumonia on 4 August, 2014. The 22-year-old Yamatji woman whose name is not used for cultural reasons, had been arrested and ordered to serve four days in custody to \u201ccut out\u201d unpaid fines worth $3,622. Her death was attributed at inquest to a severe infection in the bone of a rib broken in a domestic violence incident, which spread to form a large abscess and eventually entered her bloodstream. A coronial inquest into her death last month found some of the police charged with her care acted in an \u201cunprofessional and inhumane manner,\u201d and that the care provided by some hospital staff who saw her less than 24 hours before she died was \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d. CCTV footage of her treatment in custody, also released last month following a long campaign by her family, showed Dhu being dropped by one police officer and then dragged and carried from her cell. Riebl said he was working with Marliya Indigenous singers in the Pilbara in 2014 when he first heard of Dhu\u2019s death. \u201cIt got to me more because I was working with young Indigenous singers over there and having such a joyful time with them that the proximate tragedy of her death just really shocked me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just devastating. It\u2019s one of the most devastating stories that I have ever seen.\u201d Riebl contacted Gerry Georgatos, an activist who works with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families, about turning it into a song. Georgatos in turn connected Riebl to Dhu\u2019s family, who gave him permission to work on the song. The first person they showed was Dhu\u2019s uncle, Shaun Harris. \u201cThat\u2019s actually helped me get through some rallies and stuff for the last six months \u2013 just having a quick listen to that on the train on the way,\u201d Harris told Guardian Australia. \u201cI fell in love with it straight away.\u201d Riebl said he intended this to be a protest song to help the family\u2019s campaign for justice, which is now focused on the dual tasks of ensuring the coroner\u2019s recommendations are implemented and attempting to get some civil redress for Dhu\u2019s death. He also wanted to convey his disbelief at how she was treated. \u201cFirst of all it\u2019s disbelief and after that it\u2019s hurt and anger that this person was let down every step of the way,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s disbelief in that I didn\u2019t think it would have happened to a non-Indigenous woman.\u201d It\u2019s part of a broader project called Spinifex Gum, which will feature Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists Briggs and Emma Donovan, as well as Peter Garrett. Dhu\u2019s grandmother, Carol Roe, said she had only heard part of the song but hoped it would draw more attention to her granddaughter\u2019s story. \u201cThey see the footage and they hear the song and maybe something is going to be done now,\u201d she said. Roe said she was unhappy with the coroner\u2019s findings because they did not find anyone was at fault for Dhu\u2019s death. Instead the coroner recommended sought-after changes such as the introduction of a custody notification system and an end to the practice of jailing for fines. \u201cWe never got no justice, I never got no justice,\u201d she said. \u201cOur Aboriginal kids, my granddaughter paid the biggest price.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
