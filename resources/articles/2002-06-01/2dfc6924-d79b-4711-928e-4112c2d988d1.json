From exercise schedules to the feed in their nosebags, no expense was spared or detail overlooked if it could get their runner to post for the Derby in prime condition. But they were wasting their time. In the space of 2m 39.45 seconds, every last one of them was thoroughly \"Aidanned.\" It was not the first time, of course, but it was certainly the most comprehensive, and the 12 lengths which separated Hawk Wing from Moon Ballad, in third, were in some respects far more significant than the couple between himself and High Chaparral, his stable-mate at Aidan O'Brien's Ballydoyle yard. For weeks, the betting had suggested that O'Brien's runners might dominate the finish. This was not dominance, though. It was dictatorship. The general belief before the race - not least in the mind of Mick Kinane, who chose the wrong one - was that if Hawk Wing stayed a mile and a half, he would win. As it turned out, he did get the trip - he was going further clear of Moon Ballad almost to the line - but not as well as High Chaparral, and that made all the difference. Since Hawk Wing is now likely to drop back to 10 furlongs or even a mile, the pair of them may well carve up the major middle-distance prizes that remain, with Hawk Wing probably going to the Eclipse, and High Chaparral the Irish Derby. O'Brien is already close to a certainty to retain the British trainers' championship that he won for the first time last season. Godolphin, European racing's other major power, is now almost \u00a3700,000 adrift in win and place prizemoney. The training, racing and, in particular, breeding of thoroughbreds is such an inexact science that pre-eminence on the Flat is very difficult to maintain. Robert Sangster seemed to have it cracked in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and so too Sheikh Mohammed and the Maktoum family for the 10 years after that. Yet there is an air of impregnability about Ballydoyle, and the Coolmore Stud operation that provides its ammunition, unlike anything that has gone before. The obvious question after this one-sided Derby is whether such irresistible success is good for Flat racing at the highest level. Godolphin offers healthy resistance, certainly, but their outlook is slightly different, with more emphasis on older horses. O'Brien's, almost without exception, are retired at three. \"It would be nice to keep one or two of them racing at four,\" he suggested at the post-race press conference. The silence of John Magnier, the boss of Coolmore, was the only answer anyone required. If punters ever find the procession of O'Brien-trained winners tedious, and as yet, there is no evidence they do, then backing them would be an obvious remedy. As for the notion that whisking them off to stud at three is not the sporting thing to do, the problem is that Group One Flat racing stopped being a sport decades ago. Sheikh Mohammed may be able to forego stallion fees at fifty grand a go, but Coolmore cannot. All anyone can really do is marvel not just at the brilliance of the trainer in charge, but also the fact that he remains one of the most unaffected, self-effacing men ever to take out a licence. Get used to it, too, because at this rate, he is going to break every record there is. The distance between Hawk Wing and Moon Ballad was one of two abiding memories on Saturday. The other was the fatal fall of Coshocton, who broke his leg 20 yards from the winning post. The medical and veterinary teams who attended both Coshocton and Philip Robinson, his jockey, were swift and efficient. Even for the giddy drunks who staggered home from the funfair at nightfall, though, the image of the stricken horse should remain, a reminder of the risks we ask them to take for our pleasure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
