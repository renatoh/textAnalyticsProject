On its website it describes itself as a \u201clive entertainment experience\u201d in which \u201cvictims (you!)\u201d move through a haunted house, forest, or cornfield to be scared by \u201clive scare-actors\u201d. One customer, Tom B, called it \u201cHell on earth (in a good way)\u201d in his glowing online review, which is almost word-for-word what you\u2019d leave for a great restaurant: \u201cThis place was ridiculously good. I\u2019ve never enjoyed being so terrified. All my friends came out raving about it. Would go back again in a heartbeat.\u201d Among New Zealanders, the place has a dedicated following, hooked on the risk-free adrenaline rush of a good fright. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not genuinely terrifying: really, it is. The R-16 rating for its flagship attractions like \u201cCornEvil\u201d and \u201cDisturbia\u201d belie how scary they are: when you\u2019re being chased through a dark forest by a bloody man wielding a chainsaw, it doesn\u2019t occur to you to check if the chain is on. \u201cI\u2019ve always known about Spookers,\u201d says filmmaker Florian Habicht, \u201cand I\u2019ve always told myself: \u2018It\u2019s too scary for me, it\u2019s not my kind of thing\u2019.\u201d After his 2014 documentary, Pulp: A Film About Life, Death &amp; Supermarkets, Habicht was ready to get back into writing a drama when he got a phone call from a production company asking if he would be interested in making a film about Spookers. \u201cIn my mind I really didn\u2019t want to do it ... but I thought: \u2018Just so I know I can say no without regrets, I\u2019ll go to Spookers with my camera and do a test\u2019. When I got there, I was like: \u2018Shit. I\u2019m in love with this place\u2019.\u201d The result is Spookers \u2013 an 80-minute documentary about the close-knit community of the \u201cscream park\u201d and its 200-odd staff, with the tagline: \u201cA family like no other\u201d. Filmed using vintage Lomo Cinema lenses from the 1970s and 80s (\u201cI bought them from someone in Russia over the internet\u201d), Habicht focuses on those who have found freedom and belonging at Spookers \u2013 an unlikely harbour for their hopes, dreams and fears that are far more mundane than villainous clowns. Bloody monsters and axe murderers \u2013 in costume but not character \u2013 talk earnestly about their lives, lending the film a sort of woozy quality, as though you\u2019ve taken too many painkillers. \u201cI\u2019m bloodying up these two-headed babies to go into the incubator room,\u201d the theme park director, Beth Watson, serenely explains, to the distant sound of muzak. She runs the attraction with her daughter Julia Tukiri and her husband Andy, whose haunted expression as he responds to a \u201cCode Brown\u201d \u2013 the defecatory result of too-powerful a performance \u2013 is one of many moments of black comedy in the film. On one level, it\u2019s a look inside an unlikely business, a well-oiled scream machine \u201crun a bit like a theatre\u201d, says Habicht. \u201cIt\u2019s been going for 12 years \u2013 that\u2019s like a successful Broadway production. They\u2019re really smart business people with social media, things like that.\u201d The attraction has a sizeable following on both Facebook and Snapchat; a clip taken from inside the haunted house (\u201ctag someone who couldn\u2019t make it to the end of the hallway\u201d) has been viewed 66m times since 26 May. Habicht tells a story of Beth booking a last-minute, spur-of-the-moment flight to Los Angeles, driving through the desert to reach a manufacturer, and coming back to New Zealand with 300 sets of fake, scary teeth: \u201cIsn\u2019t that hardcore?\u201d Performers rotate across attractions, and learn to apply their own makeup and prosthetics. Particularly strong performances are recognised at the annual internal awards, the O\u2019Scares. \u201cHeaps of the staff go to Spookers on their night off and walk through it [as a visitor],\u201d says Habicht. \u201cIt\u2019s like a kind of cult thing for them.\u201d But at the film\u2019s heart is the performers\u2019 personal stories about their own struggles \u2013 with health, self-confidence, relationships, sexuality, mental illness \u2013 and the catharsis and connections they\u2019ve found in their work. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that happens behind the makeup,\u201d says one skeletal farmer, sombrely. The inherent surrealism of the setup is made explicit in dreamlike, theatrical sequences of Habicht\u2019s own devising \u2013 like one in which a zombie bride rages about being unable to land a date (\u201cMost guys don\u2019t find me too attractive, which is just crazy, because I\u2019ve actually got the whole thing going on\u201d). Moments earlier, she\u2019d been revealed as David \u2013 a young, private, man; a self-described people-pleaser \u2013 sitting cross-legged on his bed, patting his dog and fretting about what his parents would do if they caught him in character: \u201cIf they saw Zombina, I think my mum would go ballistic.\u201d David was one of a handful of performers who Habicht gravitated to on that first visit to Spookers, who make up the core cast of the film. He is now working as an airline steward. \u201cZombina is such an incredible actor \u2013 I said to David a few times: \u2018If you want me to write you a reference for drama schools or acting agents, I\u2019d love to do it\u2019, but he\u2019s happy to keep working part-time at Spookers,\u201d says Habicht. \u201cThis is the thing \u2013 for the actors, it is Hollywood.\u201d The building itself, Kingseat Hospital, is as much a presence in the film as any character. It was in operation as a psychiatric hospital from 1932, and by the late 1940s had 800 patients and 250 staff. Kingseat eventually closed in July 1999, after government policy and cultural standards directed a shift away from institutionalisation of mental health patients in favour of community care and smaller rehabilitation units. Spookers opened in 2005. Today the former psychiatric hospital is thought to be one of New Zealand\u2019s \u201cmost haunted locations\u201d, a reputation that presumably does Spookers no harm. But the building\u2019s current application doesn\u2019t sit easily with some of Kingseat\u2019s former patients and mental health advocates \u2013 particularly given how heavily its performers lean on tropes of mental illness. \u201cI\u2019ve never understood horror stories, probably because I\u2019ve spent the bulk of my life ... living in fear,\u201d says Deborah, a former Kingseat patient, in the documentary. Her parents were told by her doctor that their visits upset her; she did not see them for 18 years. The film lingers without judgement on the uneasy juxtaposition of Kingseat\u2019s past and present. Habicht says he was told \u201cextreme\u201d stories by ex-patients of their time in the institution that they did not want in the film; he intends to watch the film with Deborah in private. \u201cI think that will be her experiencing Spookers for the first time \u2013 it will be really interesting to see what she makes of it.\u201d \u201cI still can\u2019t really comprehend what it would be like to be locked up in a psychiatric hospital,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I can definitely tell that what Spookers is doing right now for mental health, for the people that work there, is really amazing.\u201d \u2022 Spookers screens as part of the Sydney Film Festival on 10 and 11 June, and in the Melbourne Film Festival in August. Its European premiere is at Sheffield\u2019s Doc/Fest on Saturday 10 June, and it will screen as part of New Zealand film festival in July"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
