In one of the most anticipated trading days in stock market history, the Dow Jones industrial average fell immediately. Ten minutes into trading, the index of 30 leading US companies was down 226 points. Within an hour, the index had shed 500 points, with the Dow hovering just above 9,100. There was a two-minute silence and a rendition of God Bless America before traders swung into action. The drop in US markets came despite an interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve just an hour before trading. The Fed slashed rates by 0.5% in its most aggressive move yet to instil confidence in a badly shaken financial system. The decision immediately boosted European markets, which had been in retreat in morning trading. The FTSE 100 was 0.49% higher at 4,779, after jumping 1.15% immediately after the rate cut. Germany's Dax index jumped 1.79% before settling back 1.03% above Friday's close. The Cac 40 in Paris was trading 0.60% higher. In a statement explaining its action, the Fed said it would \"continue to supply unusually large volumes of liquidity to the financial markets as needed until more normal market functioning is restored\". Immediately after the Fed cut major banks announced that they would lower their prime rate, the benchmark for millions of business and consumer loans, by a similar half-point, to 6%. Analysts applauded the cut, saying it was the right move to try to bolster the economy and financial markets. \"This is an encouraging sign that the Fed is there to protect the economy and the banking system,\" said Richard Yamarone of Argus Research. Yesterday, President George Bush urged people to get back to work and acknowledged some concern about how the terrorist attack has affected the struggling economy. \"I have great faith in the resiliency of the economy. No question about it, this incident affected our economy, but the markets open tomorrow, people go back to work. And we'll show the world,\" he said. The Fed signalled that if further rate cuts were needed it would provide them, saying the economy was likely to weaken further in the coming months. \"Even before the tragic events of last week, employment, production and business spending remained weak, and last week's events have the potential to damp spending further,\" the Fed said. A Fed official said the federal open market committee, the policy-making group that sets interest rates, had begun its 25-minute conference call with a moment of silence for victims of the attacks. To avert a full-blown downturn, the Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates seven times this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
