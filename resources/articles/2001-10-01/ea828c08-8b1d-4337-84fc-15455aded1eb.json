It might be better to say she has foisted the piece on us: without her apparent insistence on it, I suspect that few of us would want to spend the evening in the theatre listening to such a strangely uneven score. Written in 1791, the opera subjects the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice to philosophical scrutiny. Orpheus's psyche is dissected after the Platonic model of the soul, in which reason and unreason are locked in conflict. Unreason proves Orpheus's undoing, as passion forces him to disobey the injunction not to look at Eurydice on their return from Hades. His rational self is represented by an allegorical figure, Genio, his guide through the underworld, who counsels the abjuration of intense emotion. Bartoli has elected to play both Euridice and Genio, arguing that this enhances the work's cogency. And were she simply to sing Euridice, she would have nothing to do in the second half - taking on the role of Genio allows her to deliver the opera's major coloratura show-stopper. She does so bouncing around like a pantomime principal boy, inviting us to respond to her vocal athleticism with amazement. As Euridice, she took a while to settle. There were moments of sour tone in her opening recitative, and over-aspirated coloratura in her first aria. You are acutely aware of the self-consciousness of Bartoli's artistry, which impresses but rarely engages. Only in Euridice's death scene, in which the tone slowly drains from her voice, is she genuinely moving. What surrounds her is dispiriting. The paucity of inspiration in the score is more than once apparent, and among the rest of the cast, only Gerald Finley gives a performance of stature, singing like an angel as Euridice's father, Creonte. Roberto Sacca looks hunky as Orfeo, but his voice is reedy and unappealing. Christopher Hogwood's conducting has moments of unaccountable dullness, and the staging by director J\u00fcrgen Flimm (booed at the end of the performance) is a symbolist mish-mash that helps nobody. The set is an apertured white box through which the chorus peers to interject comments. Euridice's death is heralded by an Alien-like creature erupting through the floor, while she is shovelled into her grave by characters who have strayed from Waiting For Godot. Bartoli was cheered to the rafters, as might be expected. But a few members of the audience left during the interval. In rep until October 31. Box office: 020-7304 4000."}, "isHosted": false}}}
