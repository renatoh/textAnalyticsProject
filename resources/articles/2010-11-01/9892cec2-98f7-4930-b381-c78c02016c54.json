It's good to have Misfits back. Season two gets off to a cracking, confident start, not worrying about moving the story forwards too much or lingering over the series one finale cliffhanger. Misfits just gets on with doing what it does best: packing a wild mix of splattery gore, hilarious one-liners and surprisingly tender moments into its breezy hour. We rejoin the gang a few days on from where we left them last time. The whole issue about Nathan being buried (but not dead \u2013 \"You buried me alive you dicks!\" as he puts it) is dispatched almost as quickly as the probation officers. Kelly gets a message telling her to go to Nathan's grave (via a paper plane, which hits her in the eye \u2013 \"Ah! You fucker!\"). She takes the team and it's all pretty grim. Then her telepathy kicks in, and she hears Nathan talking to himself. Yes, he's \"knocking one out\" underground \u2013 a scene that puts a whole new spin on the idea of shuffling off the mortal coil. They dig him up, and they catch up with what we already know \u2013 he's immortal. Not only that, he's even more cocky than before: \"You should see the looks on your faces: classic! Hey, guess what, I'm immortal \u2026 That's off the A-list!\" Even if he's crapped himself six feet under. You can imagine some shows dragging this out for the whole of the first episode. Misfits scrambles through it in the first five minutes, and then jumps straight back into community service. Nathan shows up and cheeks off to the new probation officer: \"They told me you were dead.\" \"Really? Apparently not \u2013 could a dead man do this?\" Cue a goofy arm-wave from Nathan, until he wacks into one of the lockers. \"Well, I'll put you back on the system \u2026 \". A snappy, hilarious way to get over the slight technicality that being officially dead meant that Nathan wasn't expected to work off the rest of his community service. We got hints about the past, and nods to where this second series is heading. As the first series established with the rabid probation officer, Nathan's werewolf step-dad and the do-gooding cardigan squad, the lightning storm affected more people than just our asbo five. The hoodie kid who popped up in the last episode seems to be one \u2013 arriving to save Curtis tonight. (What are all the numbers and pictures of the gang in that secret lair about? An inside knowledge of the gang? How?) Meanwhile, Lucy, a shape-shifter who tries to set the gang against each other turns out to be an old friend of Simon's from the psychiatric ward where he was sent for evaluation. The Misfits chase Lucy around, trying to work out who is really who \u2013 \"We should set up a password.\" \"Monkey slut!\" \u2013 and everyone finds out that Simon killed (and froze!) their last probation worker because he wanted to protect them. Lucy (as Kelly) makes fun of Nathan \u2013 who then mouths off to the real Kelly, scuppering his romantic chances with a foul-mouthed rant (\"So \u2013 that wasn't you who said those very hurtful things about the size of my cock?\"). Nathan also winds up dead after a punch-up with Lucy (as Simon), which leaves him impaled on a pipe sticking out of the wall, through his stomach. On the upside, the others know that he's really himself. As ever, there are pop culture references dotted around \u2013 is that shot of Nathan's baseball bat dragging along the floor a nod to Walter Hill's iconic 1979 gang thriller The Warriors? Curtis's line about needing to \"watch more of that science fiction stuff\" felt like a nice in-joke from writer Howard Overman.At ascreening of the first episode last week, Overman admitted that he'd only ever read a few superhero comics, and had gone out of his way to avoid them since writing Misfits. Jonathan Ross, who was hosting the event (and seemed to have pitched his own Misfits episode to Overman) also coaxed news of a third series out of him, to follow this year's Christmas special. Clips from the rest of the series suggested that their seasonal offering is going to involve a very Misfits spin on the nativity. I can't wait."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
