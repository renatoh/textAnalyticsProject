They say that under the terms of the petroleum resource rent tax, the costs of cleaning up oil spills from exploration wells in the area would be tax-deductible, and could be held over and \u201cuplifted\u201d into future years, and claimed against the company\u2019s other projects. It means taxpayers would be forced to subsidise the clean-up of oil spills in the pristine region, paid for via a loss of future taxpayer revenue. Michael Fenner, Chevron Australia\u2019s tax manager, confirmed the news to senators during a corporate tax avoidance hearing on Friday. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson asked Chevron\u2019s executives during the hearing: \u201cCould you confirm if you have an oil spill, like sadly we saw with BP in the Gulf of Mexico, that under the [PRRT] regime you can also uptick those costs and claim them against other projects, you could actually make money out of an oil spill? Nigel Hearne, Chevron Australia\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t intend to have an oil spill.\u201d Whish-Wilson replied: \u201cI hope not, but I\u2019m just saying under the system though, the taxpayer would effectively fund it, correct?\u201d Fenner responded: \u201cWell it depends at what point in your lifecycle that spill was to occur. If it was to occur when you were actually in development, for example, they would not be transferable ... [but] if they were in the exploration phase, then yes, they would.\u201d It confirms what Treasury officials have previously told Senate estimates. They have said that under the terms of the PRRT, clean-up costs for oil spills from exploration wells would be classified as \u201cexploration expenditure\u201d. \u201cIf there was a problem with an exploration well requiring remediation expenditure, to the extent that the expenditure had a close or quite direct connection with the physical activities of the petroleum project, it would be considered exploration expenditure for petroleum resource rent tax purposes and would be available to be carried forward and uplifted,\u201d a Treasury official told Senate estimates last year. Hearne said he remained committed to a drilling program in the Great Australian Bight and was looking for a financial partner. In December, BP officially withdrew its application to drill for oil in the Bight, after having to submit plans three times. Hearne said Chevron had \u201capplied some of the lessons learned\u201d from BP\u2019s experience and was developing its environmental permit to explore in the area. Jason Ward from the Tax Justice Network has previously described this element of the PRRT system as an \u201cabsolute scandal\u201d. \u201cFirst we learn that we are giving away our natural resources to the world\u2019s largest oil companies for free and now we know they can get tax credits for oil spills,\u201d he has told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt is mind-boggling that this is actually how the PRRT works.\u201d On Friday, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said he would not be making any changes to the PRRT in the budget, despite conceding some months ago that revenues from the tax had halved since 2012-13. The government\u2019s review of the PRRT, called the Callaghan review, was released on Friday after months of inquiries. It has recommended taking a softly-softly approach to reform the tax, despite hearing from experts that the PRRT has failed to collect billions of dollars in revenue, and that Chevron\u2019s huge Gorgon gas project off Western Australia will not pay the tax until at least 2030, in spite of decades of production."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
