But Webster, veteran tenor saxophone star of the Ellington orchestra, and idiosyncratic British pianist Tracey had only just met when this was recorded at Ronnie Scott's in 1964. It's a musical dialogue \u2013 sometimes in accord, sometimes argumentative, but never dull or routine. Webster must have played Chelsea Bridge thousands of times before, but rarely more sensitively accompanied. This is Vol 2, but it was actually recorded three years earlier than Vol 1. They're both classics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
