McWhirter writes in \u2018The Wimbledon Business\u2019 that in 1964 \u2018the gross Wimbledon gate was worth more than \u00a3250,000\u2019 and outlines its revenue from TV fees, car parking, etc. Costs included, \u2018The 60 ball boys employed during the tournament, lent to the club by permission of the Council of Dr Barnardo\u2019s Homes in return for an annual donation.\u2019 Outgoing expenditure was significant, mostly because the courts have to be maintained for 50 weeks in the year outside of the tournament. The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, writes McWhirter, \u2018runs what is by common consent easily the best-organised lawn tennis event in the world. Yet under the successful surface they certainly have their worries.\u2019 This was at a time when the tournament was still open only to amateurs, but the committee and members of the club were \u2018desperately keen to open Wimbledon to professionals\u2019. If they allowed that, he argues, \u2018the Gordian knot will be cut and Wimbledon\u2019s champion will again become without question the top lawn tennis player in the world\u2026 as he used to be in pre-war days.\u2019 The wait wasn\u2019t long \u2013 in 1968 the International Tennis Federation finally voted to allow professionals to play alongside the amateurs. McWhirter concedes that the amateur men at Wimbledon are not the best in the world, but says the women players are. It\u2019s a shame then that the great Brazilian tennis player Maria Bueno (\u2018whose attractions include a fluent serve and frilly pants\u2019) is defined in the article as \u2018the daughter of a S\u00e3o Paulo horse-pill manufacturer\u2019. That surely has a strong claim for being a world record in itself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
