We go at it for hours and I usually orgasm three or more times, but he never does, no matter how much I try. Yet, when he masturbates, he can do it within a minute or two. Sometimes I feel frustrated and insecure about not doing my job. Is there anything I can do? Ask him. All you need to say is: \u201cI\u2019d love you to teach me exactly how to please you.\u201d But he may prefer to orgasm by himself. Some men have a very specific masturbation style that is difficult to emulate, so don\u2019t take it personally. Also, some people find it far easier to give pleasure than to receive it \u2013 they would benefit from trying to find a better balance (as would those who mainly prefer to be pleasured). There is also the element of distraction \u2013 some people have to work harder than others to avoid having their focus on achieving orgasm being interrupted. But it sounds as though your boyfriend is pleasing you very well; some women would consider him a perfect lover. You cannot control the timing of his climax. Unless you are trying to become pregnant, just let him be. \u2022Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. \u2022If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don\u2019t send attachments).
