Uefa is strongly opposed to plans to form such a weekend Euroleague of leading clubs from Scotland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Sweden and Denmark, who claim that they are missing out on crucial revenue because of the lack of competition within their own domestic leagues. The clubs also complain that they are lagging behind the continent's big clubs who play in more competitive leagues. Now Toine Manders, a Liberal, Democratic and Reform MP, has asked the commission to step in, claiming that Uefa is acting as a monopoly by not allowing clubs to form their own competition and that this is in breach of European trust laws. Peter Fossen, general manager of PSV Eindhoven, speaking here at Football Expo, revealed that several clubs had already signed a declaration signalling their intention to opt out of their domestic competitions to form the Atlantic league and that they would meet in Amsterdam tomorrow to chart the way forward, despite Uefa's opposition. The clubs involved are Scotland's big two plus PSV, Feyenoord, Ajax, Benfica, Sporting Lisbon, Anderlecht, Bruges, the Swedish clubs AIK and Gothenburg plus the Danish clubs Brondby and FC Copenhagen. Fossen declared: \"A European league for us is a matter of survival. We cannot continue as we are within our domestic competitions. This is the only way forward for us. \"Uefa has been frustrating us and rather than engaging our clubs in constructive dialogue it has been laying down the law and saying that only it can organise competitions. \"We need a total change of mind-set because a European league is the only way we can survive. We cannot sit still. \"The problem with smaller clubs comes with matches at the weekend. They do not generate enough money or interest. Our fans want to see us playing the likes of Manchester United. \"Not only are the best players moving away from the smaller countries but the next best players are leaving as well.\" Under plans being considered by Fossen and other club representatives, the new league would begin next year. The Champions League would still operate on a weekly basis but the Atlantic league would take the place of the clubs' regular weekend fixtures. Fossen refused to be drawn on claims that they would break away if Uefa refused to back them. \"We are meeting this Friday to discuss the way forward,\" he said. \"We do not want confrontation, we want Uefa to listen to us. Times have changed, we now operate in a European market and work within a European environment, and Uefa has to understand this.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
