Sir Alex Ferguson hopes he can return in time for the Champions League last-16 meeting against Real Madrid following his effective performance in the first leg when he helped to combat the threat of Cristiano Ronaldo. \"It is an ankle injury so I would imagine he would not be ready for Saturday and we will see what he is like after that,\" said Ferguson. Following a clash with Reading's Jobi McAnuff just before half-time Jones was able to walk unaided to the dressing room but he was later seen leaving Old Trafford on crutches wearing a protective boot. Anderson has reiterated his desire to stay at United. \"I have been good [at the club]. I have won the Champions League. I have won the Premier League. I came to Manchester United as a Brazilian and I have been here six years. I love it here. \" Are United yet to enjoy his best form? \"I came here when I was very young,\" said the 24-year-old. \"I came from Porto and there were people like [Paul] Scholes and other big players. It was hard. But in my first year I did very well. In the second I played some games and missed some, then I have had big injuries. But I have always been here when the boys have needed me.\" Anderson denied quotes which suggested he had admitted to trying to leave United on three occasions. \"It is not true,\" he said. \"Everyone knows I am happy at the club. I have had a lot of injuries but I have never let the smile go from my face. I try to help the team all the time. This is me. When I want to leave I will have to talk to the boss first. I don't have any issues. A lot of top players came here and couldn't do it - [Juan] Veron - some big players. Kleberson [a fellow Brazilian] came here and didn't play.\" He is conscious that a few clubs apart, any move away from United is a step down. \"The only places you could go to from here are Real Madrid and Barcelona,\" the midfielder said. \"You can't have another choice. The level at Manchester United is so big and so massive. You come here and you are definitely going to win titles.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
