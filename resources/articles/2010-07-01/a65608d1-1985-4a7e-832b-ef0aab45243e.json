The pond is large with two small islands and we had it dug out 22 years ago. Last week I watched a female wild mallard trying to control her ducklings as they darted here and there looking for seeds or insects. She had nested on the side of the burn at the back of the pond and had raised eight ducklings. Gradually the hooded crows have taken their toll and yesterday she was left with only four. As I idly watched them, the female walked up on to the grassy dam to preen and the ducklings followed, scampering up the bank to her side. It looked as though they were copying the female as they preened, but when they tried to peck at the feathers underneath, one of the ducklings actually fell over. I turned to the computer keyboard, but after a few minutes something caught my eye. The birds were hurriedly leaving the dam and I looked skywards to see whether it could have been a crow or buzzard that had disturbed them. Instead out from behind the bushes came a roe deer, a doe. She was wary, sniffing the air and looking round as though worried she was out in the open. I instinctively reached for the binoculars and watched her even more closely. The colour of a roe doe in her summer coat is hard to describe well enough to justify the rich colouring. Some describe it as rich foxy red, while others as glowing a foxy red, sleek and glossy. This is all right if you know what a fox's coat looks like. I just gave up trying to adequately describe it. Then the hairs on my neck tingled as out stepped a kid and then another \u2013 she had twins. They looked spindly and kept close to their mother: they were about several weeks old."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
