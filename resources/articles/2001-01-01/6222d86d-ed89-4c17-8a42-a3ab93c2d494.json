Maison de la France Useful information is buried rather deeply in the French tourist board's site, but perseverance pays off. It's also the way in to the country's regional sites, which are usually invaluable. Even the less obvious regions, such as France's border with Belgium (www.cdt-nord.fr/an/), have plenty of information in English - the hikers' leaflets are particularly impressive. G\u00eetes de France Self-catering gtes in about 50 French d\u00e9partments can be booked online. The site also explains how to reserve a place on a farm campsite, lists 8,000 B&amp;Bs, and recommends places where visitors can fish, ride or tour vineyards. So-called Panda gtes have been approved by the Worldwide Fund for Nature and are situated near nature trails. Versailles Both this and the Louvre's site are good examples of France's generous cultural budget at work. Time Out Paris Brief but succinct restaurant and hotel reviews are the chief highlight, but the Time Out Paris team also suggests events suitable for English-speaking visitors each week. These also appear in the weekly Pariscope magazine - on sale around the city for a few francs. SNCF Book a train journey in France, pay by credit card and have the tickets sent to you in advance. The booking system lets you stipulate either price or speed as a priority. Abritel A vast database of holiday properties in France, most with pictures; you then contact the owner directly (a small Union Jack indicates that they speak English) to arrange the stay. SkiFrance SkiFrance will recommend a ski resort based on your criteria. It also lists more than 200 special offers (\"promotions\") that are usually package deals or ski-pass discounts. Snow reports and free brochures (up to four at a time) are also available. Paris Balades Great collection of illustrated walks around the capital. The first four arrondisse ments have been translated into English; the others (which are arguably more intriguing) will follow. French Connections This is the place for Gemma Bovery-style kicks: a site that worships the French countryside and enables property owners to rent out their accommodation. Farmhouses, chteaux, cottages and chalets are all on offer. Rempart If you speak French, are interested in historical sites and don't mind slumming it in basic accommodation, this government-run association is an excellent way to stay in France cheaply for a few weeks. Rempart's mission is to maintain castles and other historic buildings, and the organisation accepts volunteers from all over the world. \u0095 Contact Ros Taylor at ros.taylor@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
