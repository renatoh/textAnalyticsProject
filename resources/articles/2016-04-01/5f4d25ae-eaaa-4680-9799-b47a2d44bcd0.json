Guardiola has identified Laporte among the players he wants to bring in this summer \u2013 a list that also features Ilkay Gundogan from Borussia Dortmund \u2013 and sees the 21-year-old as an upgrade on Mart\u00edn Demichelis, who will leave on a free transfer, at a time when there are also concerns about Vincent Kompany\u2019s recurring injury issues. With Demichelis coming to the end of his contract, Kompany missing several chunks of the season with calf problems and the persistent doubts about the suitability of Eliaquim Mangala and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, Guardiola is adamant that City need to bring at least one more centre-half to the Etihad Stadium. Laporte\u2019s chances of playing in the European Championship finals this summer were ended last month because of the injuries he sustained in an under-21 game for France against Scotland, but City are still trying to negotiate a deal for a player who will turn 22 in May. It will not be cheap, with Laporte\u2019s release clause reputedly worth \u00a339.6m, but there are so few high-calibre centre-backs on the market this summer there is an acceptance among the more financially powerful clubs that players operating in that position will be more expensive than usual. City have been monitoring John Stones\u2019s potential availability at Everton, acutely aware that both Chelsea and Manchester United would like to tempt him away from Goodison, but Guardiola\u2019s belief is that Laporte can play at the highest level for the next 10 years. Laporte has captained France at every level from under\u201117s to under-21s and there have been reports in Spain about Barcelona wanting to take him to the Camp Nou."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
