The protesters, organised by a local chapter of the Extinction Rebellion group, blocked traffic on the A20 near Lewisham station, A205 South Circular in Catford and the A2 in Deptford during the morning rush-hour. XR said the action was intended as the first in a series of disruptions in the area as part of a campaign called Let Lewisham Breathe. Protesters handed out leaflets and cake to apologise for the disruption caused on a main route into the centre of London. Lorna Greenwood, who took part in the protest despite being nine months pregnant, said she and about 50 fellow activists \u2013 all from the local area \u2013 began their action at 7.30am. \u201cThe idea was to stop traffic temporarily to put pressure on all of our politicians \u2013 Lewisham council, Sadiq Khan and the government \u2013 to confront the air pollution crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was some backlash but not as much as you would expect because people in the area know how bad the problem is.\u201d Levels of pollution in New Cross and Deptford are up to six times higher than World Health Organization guidelines, according to a recent study by researchers from Goldsmiths, University of London. Last year, Khan, the mayor of London, called air pollution in Lewisham a \u201chealth crisis\u201d. Greenwood said: \u201cLewisham suffers really badly with air pollution so it\u2019s at the forefront of everybody\u2019s minds and it\u2019s something that really unites people. It doesn\u2019t matter what job you do or how old you are, people have to breathe the same air.\u201d At least one commuter was \u201cvery annoyed\u201d by the disruption to her journey. Holly, 34, was stuck in a traffic jam outside Lewisham station after travelling in from Bexley, south-east London, for her childcare. She still had several miles to drive before she reached her final destination of Bromley. She told the Press Association: \u201cIt\u2019s backed up and I\u2019ve been sat in it for more than half an hour. I\u2019m definitely going to be late for work now.\u201d Graham, a resident of Lewisham who works in the public sector, said he supported the protest. He blamed queues and high numbers of traffic lights for pollution in the area. \u201cThe traffic just idles here. There\u2019s an air pollution cloud. You walk around and it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are slowly killing the people who live here by creating car parks in the city. If people could see the pollution they would do something about it. It\u2019s killing people but nobody seems to care.\u201d Lewisham council\u2019s cabinet member for environment and transport, Sophie McGeevor, said the authority was taking acting to improve air quality a number of initiatives. \u201cAs one of the first councils in the country to declare a climate emergency, we share the same goal as Extinction Rebellion \u2013 to save the planet and clean up our air,\u201d McGeevor said. \u201cWe want to go further and faster to meet this challenge, but with local government having gone through nearly a decade of austerity we need central government support to do so.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
