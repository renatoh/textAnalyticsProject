A player left out of two World Cup squads by the age of 26 has every reason to be sceptical about a recall by the manager who neglected him for the second of them. The Sunderland striker smiles ruefully at the suggestion that he is now an England regular, though he does appreciate the significance of being called up again after scoring his first international goal in Switzerland last month. \"I can't remember the last time I was involved in two squads on the bounce, to be honest,\" Bent says. \"I would like to think I am going in the right direction now. I have worked hard after a difficult two years. \"Last season I probably worked harder than I had in my whole career to get back on track, but this has been a nice start to the season for me and the club. Everything is going well, the team is going well and the goals are going in so I can't grumble. I'm playing better this year than I was last year and hopefully the goals will keep coming.\" Bent will always back his ability to take chances, and his goal figures \u2013 29 league goals in 45 games since his move to Sunderland from Tottenham in August 2009, and 125 in 295 league games overall \u2013 suggest he is firmly on the credit side of the ledger at club level. Even so, he freely admits his first international goal came as a relief. \"It was a big, big weight lifted off my shoulders,\" he says. \"It felt like it was never going to come for a while. But when the chance came I was confident enough to take it and I'm hoping there will be more.\" Not unreasonably Bent is hoping for a start against the group leaders Montenegro, who arrive with a 100% record, at Wembley on Tuesday. Not only because Fabio Capello's options are limited due to the unavailability of Emile Heskey, Jermain Defoe and Theo Walcott, but because his form for Sunderland this season suggests he deserves more than bit parts and cameo appearances. \"Everyone wants to play but I can't take it as a given,\" he says. \"Peter Crouch's record for England is second to none.\" Crouch is now having to survive on bits and pieces at Spurs, however, whereas Bent, frustrated when he was frequently left out at White Hart Lane, had little hesitation in moving to a club that offered regular football. \"I do feel I have to score a lot of goals to be selected for England but I wouldn't have it any other way,\" he explains. \"It's always nice to have something driving you on and at least I'm getting the opportunity to show what I can do at Sunderland. It's a big, big club and I play week in, week out instead of 10 minutes here, 10 minutes there. My game is better than that, and I was happy to join a club that would let me prove it. I'm playing the best football of my life and I'm happy at Sunderland. \"All I wanted to do was go somewhere and play every week. I didn't have too many conversations with Harry [Redknapp] at Spurs, to be honest. He had a way of playing and I didn't fit into his plans. But I don't hold that against him. He's a manager and has to make decisions. One of them was to let me go. \"A footballer's life can be a bit lonely at times but you have to keep going. I'm still quite young and I was never going to give up. Playing in the Premier League comes with pressure anyway. It has the best players in the world and you have to believe in yourself, even if others don't always seem to.\" Sunderland were able to help Bent over his disappointment in the summer too. As a 22-year-old he did not mind missing the 2006 World Cup too much, even though it must have been galling to see Walcott go unused even after Michael Owen's injury. \"I was only just up from the Championship, and though I was getting quite a few goals I sort of knew I might not really be ready,\" he says. \"Missing out this year was a blow that hurt like hell. Even though I knew I was only 50-50 when the phone call came it was hard to take, but Steve Bruce was brilliant, Niall Quinn was brilliant and even the club owner called me for a chat. And my mum and dad kept me going and gave me hope. I went back to my mum's house and spent a lot of time with family and close friends. I just tried to get back to normal. \"There wasn't too much I could do to vent my anger and frustration, so I went on holiday. That was where I watched all the games. It felt like I was more of a fan than a player and I found I wanted the boys to do well. I was really disappointed at the way things went for them, but not half as disappointed as the players themselves would have been.\" That is typical of Bent, uncrushed by disappointment, enthusiastic even in adversity, and not at all ready to give up on his England dream. \"I haven't thought about retiring, especially not at the age of 26,\" he says. \"I feel there are more good years in front of me. I'd love to play in a tournament, and my plan is to keep working hard towards the Euros. There's another World Cup after that. It might be too far down the line to think about but it drives me on.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
