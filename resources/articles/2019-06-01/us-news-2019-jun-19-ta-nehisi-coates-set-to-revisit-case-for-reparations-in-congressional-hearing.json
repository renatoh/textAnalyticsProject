Coates\u2019s 15,000-word article in the Atlantic contended that nearly every institution tied to American history, public and private alike, plundered resources and wealth from African Americans. This \u201cpiracy\u201d overwhelmingly enriched white Americans while bolstering racist institutions, enabling oppression to continue from the civil war\u2019s conclusion until the present. Now, five years after Coates\u2019s essay was published, the first congressional hearing on reparations in a decade will take place today, on 19 June, or Juneteenth, the holiday celebrating the emancipation of slaves in the US. Coates and the actor Danny Glover, who has long voiced support for reparations, are poised to testify at the House hearing. While it had some detractors, Coates\u2019s essay nonetheless helped reframe the perception of reparations, which had for decades been considered a bold but fringe idea that was sometimes the punchline of jokes. The former Democratic congressman from Michigan, John Conyers, first introduced a bill that sought to establish a reparations commission, with the aim to simply explore what a program might entail, three decades ago in 1989. The legislation was reintroduced every congressional session with little to no progress. \u201cJohn Conyers tried for years to get a bill,\u201d said the veteran civil rights campaigner the Rev Jesse Jackson. \u201cBut there has been a refusal even to study it. It\u2019s only if you study it then you can begin to approximate reality.\u201d Black families have an average net worth of $17,100, a tenth of the average accumulated wealth of white households, according to US government statistics. Economists routinely point to the legacy of slavery as a starting point to explain the wealth gap. Although Coates\u2019s essay sparked waves of adulation in the media, less than two years later, during the 2016 Democratic presidential primary race, the issue was completely absent from debates. Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders ruled out a program of targeted reparations during the campaign. It had also been overlooked by America\u2019s first African American president, Barack Obama. But this year, in a hotly contested primary season that has seen more than 20 candidates seek the Democratic nomination for president ahead of the 2020 election, the issue has risen to the surface once again. Several Democratic presidential candidates have voiced support for the idea of compensating descendants of slaves, though their ideas on how it should be done vary dramatically. Sanders has staunchly opposed race-focused programs. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have supported universal initiatives to help close the wealth gap for lower- and middle-income Americans. Elizabeth Warren and Juli\u00e1n Castro have discussed a taskforce to study possible race-specific reparations. Marianne Williamson has mentioned a $100bn fund to pay slaves\u2019 descendants directly. Jackson, who campaigned on the issue during his runs for president in 1984 and 1988, insisted that this in and of itself was a positive, if long overdue, step forward. \u201cThere was never an attempt to repair the damage done to a people,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cEven 40 acres and a mule was just talk. Even then, the few who got it were driven off their property.\u201d The Texas Democratic representative Sheila Jackson Lee, the resolution\u2019s new sponsor following Conyers\u2019 resignation, introduced the measure again in 2019. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Congress, said in February that she favors a reparations study. Booker has also secured at least one dozen co-sponsors for his Senate reparations bill, which would launch a commission to study slavery\u2019s impact on African Americans \u2013 and come up with possible ways to repay descendants, according to the Root. Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a congressional representative of New York, supported reparations in a discussion with Coates this year. Following a request for comment, an assistant to Coates said he wasn\u2019t adding any more interviews to his schedule. But in a recent interview with the New Yorker, he expressed optimism about how the dialogue on reparations has shifted. \u201cI think people have stopped laughing, and that is really, really important,\u201d Coates said. \u201cDoes it mean reparations tomorrow? No, it doesn\u2019t. Does it mean end of the fight? No, it doesn\u2019t. But it\u2019s a step, and I think that\u2019s significant.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
