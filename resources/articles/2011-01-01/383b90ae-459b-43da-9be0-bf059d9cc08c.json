A message on David Beckham's Facebook page said: \"I've got some great news to tell you all. Victoria and I are expecting our fourth child this summer. The boys are very excited about the arrival of a new brother or sister.\" A spokeswoman for Victoria Beckham confirmed the news but declined to give a more specific due date or confirm how far the pregnancy was advanced. The Beckhams were tonight in the UK, where they are expected to stay until February when David returns to LA Galaxy and Victoria attends New York fashion week. The spokeswoman said both their families were \"naturally delighted\" with the announcement of a fourth child. Amanda Holden, who recently announced her own pregnancy, took to her Twitter page to congratulate the couple and wrote: \"Great News that the Beckham's are expecting their 4th child! Hope they get a pink one!\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
