Two episodes into Zoo \u2013 the story of a rebellious bestial kingdom based on a James Patterson book and dubbed \u201canimal apocalypse\u201d \u2013 and I realise I\u2019m cheering for the non-human cast. I\u2019m sure in Sweden, home of free universities, marriage equality and low national debt, the show would be regarded as a straight-up horror series. Viewed in Australia, where windfarms are considered an energy source too mature to invest in (unlike coal, which still has that young \u2019n\u2019 funky \u201cfossil\u201d vibe), an animal takeover seems like a positive improvement. That this country would be better run under a bestial assembly of stray dogs and grumpy farm animals is probably all Zoo has going for it (though let\u2019s pause to remember that if a variety of bizarre animals did get into government, Mr Dog on the Moon would be out of a job). Unless viewed through this prism though, the show itself is a bit naff. Perhaps Ten shouldn\u2019t have advertised it as \u201cTV\u2019s mystery event of the year\u201d for starters. A plot that centres around the idea of animals turning on people isn\u2019t really mysterious, hence Jaws, Jurassic Park, Planet of the Apes, King Kong and Furry Vengeance. Them hating our guts is about as old as us wanting to put them into sandwiches. The only way this could have been a mystery was if a rhino sidled up to a poacher, patted him on the back and said: \u201cKeep up the good work. We don\u2019t like ourselves much anyway.\u201d Instead, it\u2019s all rather predictably executed, with the vanguard of the violent fauna comprising dogs and big cats. The intro sequence asks us to image what would happen if animals \u201cdecided to fight back\u201d but most species seem to be lacking commitment to this all-out war. No one\u2019s been harassed by a goose, head-butted by a dolphin, nor has anyone in the series come home drunk to find that a clew of worms have somehow broken into their living room and assembled to spell \u201csod off\u201d on the carpet. What little intrigue there is so far seems to be hampered by the clunky delivery. The main character, Jackson Oz, keeps watching old video lectures of his supposedly crackpot father, in which there are hidden clues. Except they aren\u2019t hidden. His father keeps mentioning a \u201cdefiant pupil\u201d which Jackson mistakes to mean a student, when it actually means an animal\u2019s eye dilating in a weird way. Did daddy need to be so tediously enigmatic? Why not say: \u201cLions\u2019 eyes go a bit funny when they want to overthrow humanity and install a feline dictatorship\u201d? He\u2019s ambiguous purely for plot purposes. There\u2019s other stuff that jars, most specifically the moment in the second episode where, thanks to suggestive editing, lions are suddenly able to operate smartphones. A terrifying prospect if they can: I don\u2019t want to go on to Instagram and see a mauled zebra carcass with a nostalgic filter over it hashtagged #lionlunch). Fortunately here, they just made a call to attract the attention of Jackson so he could rescue a friend from a tree. On a side note, I think there needs to be a rule that, like the Wilhelm scream, you can only use the MGM lion roar once per episode, unlike in Zoo where, if you played the MGM lion roar drinking game, you\u2019d be in an alcoholic coma within the first few minutes. Is that the only lion anyone\u2019s ever successfully recorded? So far, Zoo isn\u2019t so much the mystery event of the year as a subpar episode of The X-Files crossed with Doctor Dolittle. That aside, it is rather fun watching humanity get its comeuppance, and I\u2019ll continue to watch, purely so I can cheer for an army of puppies to wreak their terrifyingly cute vengeance on humankind. Makes me wonder what my puppy could have against me: I clean up after him, feed him, let him live rent free. Actually, come to think of it, he\u2019s taken over already."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
