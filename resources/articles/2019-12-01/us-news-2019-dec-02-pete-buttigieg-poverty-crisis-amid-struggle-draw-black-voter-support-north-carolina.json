On a cool, rainy morning, Buttigieg attended a packed service at Greenleaf Christian church, led by the social justice activist William Barber and the group Poor People\u2019s Campaign. Afterwards, Barber and Buttigieg took part in a roundtable poverty discussion where the 2020 candidate fielded questions on everything from climate change to the minimum wage. \u201cWe\u2019re here to address the issue of poverty and low wealth as a moral crisis,\u201d said Barber, who is behind the Forward Together Moral Movement group that gained national attention with its Moral Monday protests at the North Carolina general assembly beginning in 2013. \u201cEvery generation has its struggles. And that\u2019s part of the story,\u201d Barber said. \u201cBut the question is how long are we going to stay divided and how long are we going to stay still? That\u2019s our choice.\u201d On the anniversary of Rosa Parks\u2019 protest that launched the Montgomery bus boycott, audience members pressed Buttigieg on his plans to tackle what Barber called the \u201cinterlocking issues\u201d of poverty, including voter suppression, gerrymandering, education and healthcare. \u201cFrankly, people in politics are often specifically advised to speak of the middle class and not to use the word poor or poverty too much,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much theorizing about poverty, and theorizing leads to misunderstanding.\u201d Buttigieg touted his record of economic development during his time as mayor, and acknowledged the necessity of discussing issues such as voter suppression and climate change alongside poverty. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot we have to do to get people a better income,\u201d he said. In 2018, roughly 38 million people lived in poverty, according to the Census Bureau, with Native Americans (26%) the most affected, followed by black Americans (21%), Hispanics (18%) and white Americans (10%). In Buttigieg\u2019s hometown of South Bend \u2013 which is 26% black \u2013 black unemployment stands at 9.2% compared with 4.9% for whites, with black households earning roughly half the income of their white counterparts, according to one 2017 study. The event was a bit of a makeup for Buttigieg, who did not attend a similar Poor People\u2019s Campaign forum in June, during which eight of the presidential candidates spoke about their plans to address poverty and low-income communities in the US. But Sunday\u2019s discussion came at a good time for Buttigieg, who has so far struggled to garner support from black voters. Last week, a video made the rounds of Buttigieg from a mayoral candidate roundtable in 2011 discussing the need for mentors to help minority children succeed in education. \u201cThe kids need to see evidence that education is going to work for them,\u201d Buttigieg said in the clip. \u201cThere are a lot of kids, especially the lower income, minority neighborhoods, who literally just haven\u2019t seen it work. There isn\u2019t somebody they know personally who testifies to the value of education.\u201d The Root writer Michael Harriot was among those to criticize Buttigieg for overlooking the role systemic racism plays in holding back minority students. \u201cWhite kids get more resources, more advanced classes and have access to more technology. But Pete says it could all be solved with a vision-board,\u201d Harriot wrote in response. \u201cMen like him are more willing to perpetuate the fantastic narrative of negro neighborhoods needing more role models and briefcase carriers than make the people in power stare into the sun and see the blinding light of racism.\u201d Buttigieg has previously been criticized for firing South Bend\u2019s first black police chief, Darryl Boykins, in 2012, as well as his response to the killing of a black man, Eric Logan, by a white police officer in the city over the summer. Buttigieg\u2019s landmark policy to address structural racism, titled the Douglass Plan after the abolitionist Frederick Douglass, has also come under fire for using a stock photo of a Kenyan woman and listing several prominent black South Carolinians who later rescinded their support. Despite a recent uptick in the polls \u2013 a 16 November tally of Democratic primary voters marked Buttigieg the frontrunner in the predominantly white Iowa caucus race, 10 points ahead of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden \u2013 the 37-year-old has yet to achieve similar success among black voters. Nationwide, Buttigieg has the support of just 4% of black voters, according to a Quinnipiac poll released last week. In South Carolina, ahead of the state\u2019s 29 February primary, that number is zero. Sekia Royall was among those in attendance Sunday. A self-described Bernie Sanders supporter, the longtime Goldsboro resident said she appreciated Buttigieg facing potentially difficult topics head-on. \u201cHis message is consistent,\u201d the 47-year-old said. Royall, who previously met Buttigieg at an event in South Carolina, said that her main issue lies with the candidate\u2019s \u201cMedicare For All Who Want It\u201d healthcare plan, which she said doesn\u2019t do enough to cover low-income populations. As for Buttigieg gaining support among minority voters, Sunday was a step in the right direction, she added. \u201cComing out to the community where he needs a vote is a good look,\u201d Royall said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
