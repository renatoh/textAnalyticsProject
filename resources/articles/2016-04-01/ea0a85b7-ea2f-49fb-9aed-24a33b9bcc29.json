Stags and hinds arrived with humans \u2013 but not from Scandinavia, nor from the British mainland. And they can only have arrived by ship: transported by enterprising Neolithic colonists who had learned to treat deer as livestock, long ago and far away in Europe. Scientists report in the Proceedings B of the Royal Society that they studied sequences of DNA from Cervus elephus on the Outer Hebrides and from Orkney to settle the question of origins. And they established that the island deer were not introduced from Scotland. That is, they were not related to red deer already roaming the mainland. Their results were also \u201cinconsistent with an origin from Ireland or Norway.\u201d So the only other possible answer is, they say \u201clong distance maritime travel by Neolithic people \u2026 from an unknown source.\u201d The finding also suggests that new stone age humans found a way to domesticate red deer. \u201cDomestication is probably a misleading word for it,\u201d said David Stanton, of Cardiff University, who led the genetic analysis. \u201cWe consider them to be wild animals, but wild could probably be put in inverted commas. There was a stronger relationship with these animals than we previously thought.\u201d The Orkney and Hebridean invasions could only have happened after the retreat of the ice 10,000 years ago, and, says Jacqui Mulville, a bioarchaeologist at Cardiff University, red deer kept the first mainland Britons alive: they provided food, skins, sinews, bones and tools made of antler. Almost no evidence survives of Neolithic sea-going craft. But the Scottish islands are separated from the mainland by deep waters, at distances beyond any deer\u2019s swimming capability. \u201cAll terrestrial fauna must have been deliberately introduced by seafaring people,\u201d Dr Mulville says. \u201cThese people were sophisticated, skilled farmers, with large settlements. The islands were popular places to settle, with sufficient resources to allow people to thrive. The coastal environments offered a wide range of marine, coastal, terrestrial and aerial resources and these people utilised them all.\u201d Europe\u2019s red deer probably survived the ice ages somewhere in the Iberian peninsula, and spread across the continent as the glaciers retreated. They were the ancient European\u2019s first animal resource, until the arrival of farming from the Middle East. Although the genetic lineages of the island deer were unique, one at least matched deer fibre found in the clothing of \u00d6tzi the Iceman, the copper age humanwho died on an Alpine glacier 5,000 years ago. Dr Mulville called the results \u201csurprising.\u201d \u201cThis evidence suggests we have misunderstood our relationship with this species. Perhaps humans managed deer, having long-term relationships with herds that allowed them to plan, capture and transport deer on longer voyages.\u201d The study, the scientists say, presents \u201cthe first attempts to understand the deliberate translocation of faunal species into insular Britain and track the source for these introductions.\u201d And, they concede, the antlered invaders came from \u201ca currently unidentified source population.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
