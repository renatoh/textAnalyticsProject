The ad shows a man being stung by an insect and his dash to a lake to stop his face swelling up. When he emerges from the lake, swamped by weeds, he is confronted by police. A voice says: \"Statistically you're more likely to get arrested than change your bank account.\" The ad, designed by agency BBH, prompted complaints that the man was being mocked for having an anaphylactic shock and that some children might be distressed when watching it. Barclays donated \u00a310,000 to the Anaphylaxis Campaign and issued an apology. The ad had been approved by Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre, but the ASA said it should not have been shown around programmes aimed at children."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
