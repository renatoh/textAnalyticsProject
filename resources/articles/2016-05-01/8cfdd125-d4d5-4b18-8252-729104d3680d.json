The former Labour leader has signed a joint declaration with environment secretary Liz Truss, former energy secretary Ed Davey and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas in what pro-EU campaigners called an unprecedented partnership. They claim that those campaigning for Brexit are climate change deniers who are ignorant of the potential impact. \u201cCollective action is the only solution to rising seas and rising temperatures. The European Union is central to both these challenges,\u201d they say in a pamphlet setting out the arguments. EU membership supported domestic action to improve air quality, protect nature and wildlife and invest in renewable energy, they say, and Brussels is \u201ca leader in the battle to secure binding agreements\u201d internationally. \u201cThose campaigning for Britain to leave Europe cannot be trusted on the environment,\u201d they say. \u201cThey have opposed vital green measures and denounced climate change as \u2018mumbo jumbo\u2019. They demonstrate a cavalier ignorance about climate matters which embodies the extreme and out-dated outlook of those who want to leave. \u201cIf Britain leaves Europe, our environment, our wildlife and our global habitat will be starved of investment, bereft of protections and denied the leadership it needs,\u201d the declaration says. But environment minister George Eustice \u2013 who supports Vote Leave \u2013 said the EU had \u201csystematically undermined the UK\u2019s place on international wildlife conventions\u201d. \u201cWe have already been stripped of our voting rights on regional fisheries management organisations and, extraordinarily, it is now unlawful for the UK to speak at wildlife conventions like Cites (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) without first getting permission for what we want to say from the European commission. \u201cIf we vote to leave and take control, the UK would regain its own seat and its voice in vital international wildlife conventions and everything from promoting shark conservation to ending whaling would become much easier.\u201d In a further development, Tory grandee Michael Heseltine has criticised MPs backing Brexit for turning on the government during the debate. The former cabinet minister said some Tory MPs owe their jobs and the party\u2019s surprise general election victory to David Cameron. He told Sky News: \u201cThe facts are that he won this election for the Conservatives, and now to see people who, frankly, many of them would not have their seats and certainly many of them wouldn\u2019t be in government if David Cameron hadn\u2019t won that election for the Conservatives. \u201cAnd to see them now turning on the policies that some of them have been sitting in the government implementing, I just find mind-blowing.\u201d It comes after senior figures insisted the Conservatives could unify after what has been a fractious EU referendum campaign. On the Andrew Marr show, Ukip leader Nigel Farage claimed Cameron would not continue as prime minister if the UK voted to leave the EU."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
