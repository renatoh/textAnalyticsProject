Recently he's been engaged in a bid to improve his image, setting out several new initiatives and reiterating his intent to press ahead with the evacuation of illegal settlements. He will doubtless be unhappy, then, with this latest photograph of him, taken as he monitors a military exercise in the Golan Heights with the aid of field binoculars from which the lens caps have been insufficiently removed. The snatched image is, however, misleading: apparently he looked through them no less than three times, nodding soberly as the army's new chief of staff explained what was going on. He'll be lucky if he ever sees another picture of himself again. Chris Eubank Despite a relatively low public profile since he became a bankrupt last year, the former WBO champion and leading proponent of the double Windsor knot can still make his influence felt when the political situation demands it. By driving up and down Whitehall in a giant lorry bearing a banner which says \"Blair, don't send our young prince to your catastrophic illegal war to make it look plausible\" - exploiting both his incisive command of the English language and his HGV licence - Eubank showed himself to be a man with his finger firmly on the pulse of the nation. How many of us were thinking what only Chris dares to say? With his demonstration and subsequent arrest Eubank has drawn attention to one of the lesser debated aspects of this most implausible of wars, just as the announcement of a major troop withdrawal threatened to make the whole idea of protest seem pointless and futile. Eubank's political future is assured, but which party will claim him? David Beckham The Real Madrid star could only ever get involved in Swiss regional politics in one way, and that's \"unwittingly\". Sure enough, without his consent, prior knowledge or, it's safe to assume, full understanding, David Beckham has become embroiled in a dispute over campaign materials promoting the candidacy of Philippe Leuba, a former referee who is standing in local government elections in the Vaud region. The newspaper advert in question features a picture of Leuba shaking hands with Beckham before a 2005 friendly between England and Argentina. A \"thought bubble\" emerging from Beckham's head (as if!) contains the words: \"I hope you are just as impartial in the state parliament as you were on the football pitch\", perfectly capturing, one imagines, the precise cadences of the midfielder's interior monologue. Beckham's management contacted lawyers, who in turn contacted Leuba, who in turn grew bemused. \"I don't think anybody in Switzerland would really have thought that David Beckham was supporting my campaign or even knew anything about it,\" he said. Well quite. What we've learnt \u00b7 This year the All-England Club will pay female Wimbledon winners the same as men for the first time \u00b7 The history department of Middlebury College, Vermont, has banned students from citing Wikipedia in papers and exams and what we haven't \u00b7 The whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, despite the best efforts of psychics recruited by the MoD - according to newly declassified documents News from: Second Life Reacting to what it sees as increasing commercialisation within this bafflingly popular cyberworld, the Second Life Liberation Army has detonated an atomic bomb at a virtual American Apparel outlet. With more than 2 million people visiting this online fantasy world, Second Life real estate has become extremely attractive to actual retail chains, and the SLLA is committed to maintaining its Utopian principles by any means necessary. Marshall Cahill (not his real name), the political officer (not a real title) for the terrorist group (not really), told the LA Times that \"the population of the world should have a say in the running of the world.\" In a previous action SLLA members shot customers outside Reebok's Second Life branch. Luckily bullets in Second Life don't kill, so in place of an agonising debate about whether violence is ever justified in pursuit of political aims, we need only concern ourselves with the question of whether Cahill and his little friends might be better off getting some fresh air.

'She does not want to give interviews and we must also not give her phone number to anyone.
