Meanwhile a 98-year-old has made an unexpected recovery and pupils at a special school came together in a virtual choir. Syrian film-maker becomes a hospital cleaner A Syrian film-maker in London, who signed up to become a hospital cleaner, made an emotional plea for people to embrace diversity as he praised NHS staff who come from all over the world. \u201cThe nurses and the ward hosts and the cleaners and the porters are the spine of the hospital,\u201d said Hassan Akkad on Good Morning Britain, as he fought back tears. \u201cAnd they are from everywhere, the Caribbean, Chad, the Philippines, Spain, Poland. \u201cI hope if this teaches us one thing, it teaches us to be kinder to one another despite where we come from. I hope this changes us for the best.\u201d Akkad, 32, arrived in the UK in late 2015, documenting his difficult journey for a BBC film that went on to win a Bafta. In a now viral tweet, Akkad said he was \u201chonoured to join an army of cleaners disinfecting Covid wards [at] our local hospital after receiving training\u201d. He added: \u201cLondon has been my home since leaving Syria, and the least I can do is making sure my neighbours and the amazing NHS staff are safe and sound.\u201d Country gets creative with NHS tributes People around the country are thinking of creative ways to pay tribute to hardworking NHS staff. A family in Chandler\u2019s Ford near Southampton used Christmas lights to create a display showing their appreciation for the NHS. Gary Woodman and his family used white and blue lights to spell out NHS surrounded by a heart to show \u201ca little bit of respect\u201d. The family decided to go the extra mile after they realised a neighbour who lives opposite works for the ambulance service. Meanwhile, in Northumberland, a huge \u201cNHS THANK YOU\u201d message has been mowed on to the lawn outside Northumbria specialist emergency care hospital in Cramlington, while a farm in Barkisland, West Yorkshire, sprayed NHS on to a ewe and her newborn lambs instead of numbers. Haigh Farms sprayed the ewe and her newborn with the tag as the lamb was born on the evening of 2 April, the night of the second nationwide clap for carers to thank NHS staff. Pupils join together for virtual choir Elms Bank school in Bury, Greater Manchester, has created a virtual choir for pupils and staff to join together in their singing. The special educational needs school set up a #keepsinging challenge when pupils with health issues started self-isolating at home, and it has since evolved into a virtual choir. \u201cSinging is just such a huge part of our community and we didn\u2019t want to lose that,\u201d said assistant headteacher Catherine Dent. \u201cOur children love singing and it\u2019s a good form of communication for them. We\u2019ve got a third of our school in our school choir.\u201d Dent recorded herself singing True Colours, with a colleague playing the musical accompaniment, before sending the video to parents to record their children singing along. They then put all the videos together to create the choir. \u201cWe were amazed by the number of videos \u2026 and not just our more able children, from our real low-ability children as well, so that was really nice,\u201d said Dent. \u201cIt shows that everyone can achieve.\u201d Many of the participants joined in with Signalong, an alternative type of signing. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive part of our communication because obviously some students are non-verbal, so we encourage everyone to sign,\u201d Dent said. \u201cSinging and signing just goes together for us.\u201d Woman, 98, makes makes coronavirus recovery Daphne Shah, 98, tested positive for Covid-19 at Dundee\u2019s Ninewells hospital and spent five days there before making a full recovery and being discharged on Monday. \u201cWhen she left in the ambulance, I honestly never thought I\u2019d see her again,\u201d her son, Wesley Shah, told the BBC. \u201cThey had never come across a person of nearly 99 who has recovered from the virus.\u201d Wesley said his mother was relatively healthy before she contracted the virus, and he called medical assistance when she developed a cough and high temperature. After initially being prescribed antibiotics, she was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with coronavirus. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even need to go on a ventilator and yet she was struggling for air when she left (home),\u201d he said. \u201cThe NHS in Scotland have always been tops, but this time around they have just been unbelievable.\u201d He is now looking forward to celebrating his mother\u2019s 99th birthday in July, and hopes she will be able to receive her message from the Queen when she turns 100 next year. He added: \u201cI thought it would be a shame if Covid took her life before then, because she was doing so well.\u201d \u2022 Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
