The word should have been \"impartial\" (The blockade, 1 June, page 5). \u2022 The headline on a piece about civil-service salaries was more definitive than the text, declaring: \u00a3275,000 a year \u2013 UK's highest paid civil servant revealed (1 June, page 1). What the story said, however, was that this was the person whose pay topped an incomplete list, comprising the 170 senior civil servants who agreed to their earnings bracket being published. Eleven people refused to have their pay divulged and the government chose not to disclose a further three. \u2022 A news brief reported that Rhossili Bay on the Gower Peninsula had been voted Britain's best picnic spot by members of a travel writers' group, but the headline shifted the peninsula from Wales to an English county when it declared: Remote Devon cliff top voted best picnic spot (29 May, page 18). \u2022 A Shortcut meant to ask whether \"the UK's only World Cup squad should lie back and think of England\".

Repeal drugs laws, 22 May, page 40 \u2013 gave the title of a book co-written by Alan Duncan as Satan's Children. The title is actually Saturn's Children (subtitle: How the State Devours Liberty, Prosperity and Virtue)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
