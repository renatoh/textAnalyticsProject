Roman Abramovich's petty cash is spreading like a particularly infectious rash and so it is that Chelsea could effectively help to bail Leeds out of the red. For, having given Internazionale a money printing press complete with the licence to use it in exchange for the bubbled-lip Hernan Crespo, Inter are now in a position to fling \u00a38m in crisp tenners in Leeds's direction on the condition that they send Mark Viduka over by return of post. The deal could stumble over who will stump up the considerable sum for postage and packing, however. Leeds are not keen on parting with their portly Antipodean, says the Star. However, they could do with some money so that they can buy things like bread and milk. And Brazilian World Cup winner Roque Junior from Inter's neighbours AC Milan. Leeds are hoping to succeed where Bolton were laughed at by bringing the defender to the Premiership on a season-long loan, says the Mirror. However, Brazilian World Cup winner Roque Junior's weekly wage of \u00a340,000 may have to be cut by the odd \u00a339,000. With both Everton and Middlesbrough unwilling to buy faulty goods, Fulham have been unable to flog knee-knacked Sean Davis. This means they might be about to lose out on the signing of Sunderland's Claudio Reyna to Manchester City, says the Sun. Reyna wasn't that fussed about spending another season fighting a losing battle to stay in the Premiership anyway, apparently. A \u00a32m offer should seal the deal. Manchester City's interest in Steve McManaman may now have petered out like one of the languid Liverpudlian's directionless dribbles. So step forward David Moyes who is waving \u00a32m excitedly in the air like there's a transfer deadline at the weekend. The Sun spotted Real Madrid boss Carlos Queiroz taking Macca on a guided tour of the Bernabeu, pointedly pointing out the exits \"here, here and here\". Everton are offering a two-year deal but the 31-year-old is holding out for three. \"I know he is talking to a club and it is better for him and for us if it is sorted within the next 48 hours,\" said Queiroz. What's more, Everton could be set to sign Sporting Lisbon goalkeeper Nelson, 27, on a season-long loan, says the Express. Richard Wright has done his knee after playing against Charlton/falling out of a loft and so Nelson could be in net for the Merseyside derby this weekend. Celtic are attempting to gazump Wolves in the signing of Brazilian midfield star Emerson, says the Daily Record. Emerson, pictured in the Record above the caption which reads \"Caption: caption please\" is available for \u00a3800,000. Last and by all means least, Chelsea will complete the signing of Claude Makelele for one of the following made-up prices: \u00a314m (Daily Mail), \u00a318m (Daily Star), \u00a310m (Sun)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
