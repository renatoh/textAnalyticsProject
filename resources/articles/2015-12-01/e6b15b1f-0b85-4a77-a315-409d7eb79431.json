Led by senior frontbencher Jenny Macklin, Labor has settled on \u201csix pillars\u201d of social policy: \u2022 Early years including maternal and child health, childcare and kindergarten \u2022 Education including schools, universities, vocational education and lifelong/adult learning \u2022 Employment \u2022 Work, care and family \u2022 Active ageing \u2022 Stronger communities, such as local input for decisions with a strong community sector, as well as addressing locational disadvantage. Macklin told Guardian Australia the review, which will be released before parliament sits next year, would place employment at the centre of social policy framework. She said, apart from extensive consultation, it was Abbott\u2019s first budget in 2014 that helped crystalise Labor\u2019s social policy formulation by creating a clear picture of what the Australian population did not want from government. \u201c[Abbott and Hockey] pushed the austerity economics really hard and all these great economic thinkers were saying that is not the way to go,\u201d Macklin said. \u201cThat whole period was characterised by Australians really saying \u2018this is not our country, we don\u2019t believe in this unfairness\u2019.\u201d Macklin began the review immediately after the 2013 election to redesign Labor policy for the social welfare system \u2013 originally designed in the 1950s \u2013 in consultation with academics, business and unions. An economist, Macklin said her discussions with people such as Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz underlined how inequality was bad for economic growth. \u201cIt enabled us to have the Australian people saying that\u2019s the sort of country we want to live in, we want full employment, we don\u2019t want people unemployed, we want kids to have hope for good future, we don\u2019t want to lose that essential fairness because that is who we are.\u201d Macklin, the opposition spokeswoman for families and payments disability reform, said the review was designed to look at the big changes happening in society and how governments should respond, providing a policy framework for the next election and beyond based on \u201cinclusive growth\u201d. The review says in part: \u201cWe need a new social policy model for a new era \u2013 a model that is based on inclusive economic growth, social protection and social investment. \u201cIf you work hard, whether through paid employment or unpaid care, you will be rewarded. If you fall behind, you\u2019ll receive the help you need to get back on track. In Australia, you are responsible for your own success, but you are never on your own.\u201d Macklin said the dominant theme of the report was employment, including job creation, job security, decent working conditions and ensuring skills and capabilities to fill the jobs of the future. Before politics, Macklin was an economics researcher at the Australian National University and the parliamentary library, as well as a ministerial adviser in health. She said after her time as a minister in the Rudd and Gillard governments, she consulted more than 100 experts in their fields on the changes in family and work life. She is MP for Jagajaga in Victoria and remains on Labor\u2019s election policy committee. \u201c[Government] payments were designed in the 1950s for families that don\u2019t exist any more, for an employment system that doesn\u2019t exist any more,\u201d said Macklin. \u201cThere can be a huge range of different reasons yet we don\u2019t have a work set up that recognises that women and increasingly men \u2013 someone \u2013 has to do these caring jobs and families fall apart when some crisis happens because they are living so close to the edge. None of our payments fit that. \u201cWe have an aged pension that covers that long period in retirement and we have an unemployment benefit that is really designed for people to be unemployed for a short period, other than that you couldn\u2019t possibly live on it.\u201d Macklin said when she was 35, she had children, a mortgage and a stable job. But increasingly that age group moved in and out of work, usually did not have mortgages and had children later. \u201cObviously we have to think about how we continue to support parents, the debate around childcare is just one part of that,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of people who need all sorts of combos. Once the children are at school, we just haven\u2019t thought about it. This is the whole point. I think out-of-school-hours care is the most important thing we can do to support parents, but nobody is talking about it. \u201cThere might be other things we can do for carers who combine work and care, obviously paid parental leave is helping people doing one of the most important caring jobs.\u201d The review, which included contributions from Labor rising stars such as Clare O\u2019Neil, Tim Watts and Andrew Leigh, focuses on \u201cinclusive growth\u201d as the basis for social policy. Macklin uses the example of the National disability insurance scheme (NDIS), which she implemented as minister. \u201cSome people just can\u2019t see past the cost,\u201d Macklin said. \u201cThis is the essence of the austerity versus inclusive growth philosophy. If you just see all these things as a cost, the social security system as a cost, you don\u2019t see that investing in people with a disability means you put all these supports in their package and then the mother can go to work and the disabled person can go to work.\u201d The review aims to treat social investment as a \u201ccompanion\u201d to social protection. Unlike traditional welfare models which focused solely on protection, such as income support payments, Macklin said Labor\u2019s review would suggest modern social policy needed an \u201cinvestment\u201d approach to certain life stages, such as education or early childhood, so that individuals could contribute to economic growth and wider society. Macklin said the other change she would welcome in government social policy was a new way of measuring progress, other than just gross domestic product . She said the Social Progress Index was one method that included not only economic output but also personal rights, environmental sustainability, access to education and tolerance and inclusion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
