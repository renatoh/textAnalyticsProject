The deal underlined just how far the hubris of the internet-driven boom has been deflated. Under the terms of the agreement, Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate which built the Orange mobile phone business, and Singapore Technologies Telemedia will inject the cash for a 61.5% stake. In a restructuring aimed at allowing Global Crossing to emerge from bankruptcy early next year, the company's creditors will receive $300m in cash, $200m in loan notes and 38.5% of the business. A US bankruptcy court approved the plan yesterday. Edward Weisfelner, a lawyer for Global Crossing's creditors, said the approval \"sets the stage for a prompt and efficient restructuring\". Shareholders in the company will receive nothing. Global Crossing buckled under $12.4bn in debts, falling prices and a glut of high-speed network capacity built in anticipation of demand that has yet to appear. It filed for bankruptcy in January. But the business did not fail before making a few senior executives immensely rich. Gary Winnick, the company's former chairman and founder, cashed in about $734m in shares before the collapse. He paid $65m for a 15-bedroom Bel-Air house in 2000, not far from the company's main offices in Beverly Hills. Chief executives - there were five in as many years - were given extravagant packages including in one case a $10m signing-on fee. Workers, many of whom lost pensions and savings tied up in Global Crossing shares, are furious at the former management. The two Asian buyers had offered $750m for a 79% stake earlier this year but talks broke down in May."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
