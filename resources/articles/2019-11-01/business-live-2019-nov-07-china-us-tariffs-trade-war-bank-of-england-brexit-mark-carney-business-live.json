A small rally, to a one-month high. Firms vulnerable to trade conflict rose today, including packaging firm Smirfit Kappa and fashion chain Burberry. Back in the markets, Wall Street has hit another record high on hopes of a US-China trade deal. The Dow has surged by 261 points, or almost 1%, at 27,754, after Beijing\u2019s commerce ministry said the two sides had agreed to lower some tariffs as part of a Phase One deal. The White House hasn\u2019t confirmed the move, but traders are optimistic that the talks are heading towards a breakthrough. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The trade tensions of late August and early September seem like a distant memory now as there is chatter of undoing the levies. Neither side wants to appear weak, but the tariffs are clearly hurting each other, so a joint de-escalation would be an easy way out. If President Trump is being reasonable with China, he is less likely to turn up the heat on the EU, which is helping stocks on this side of the Atlantic. Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s Bank of England forecasts, and interest rate decision: The chances of a cut in interest rates have increased after two members of the Bank of England\u2019s key policy body responded to a growth downgrade inspired by Brexit and a trade war by voting for cheaper borrowing. In the first split vote on Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) since June 2018, the Bank voted 7-2 to keep official interest rates on hold at 0.75%, but two of the outside experts the government appointed to the committee , Jonathan Haskell and Michael Saunders, said the weakness of the economy warranted an immediate reduction. The Bank thinks the short-term prospects for the economy have improved because the risk of a no-deal Brexit has diminished, but it expects the level of national output \u2013 gross domestic product \u2013 over the next three years to be 1% lower than it had anticipated in August. It said three-quarters of the downgrade had been because of changes in asset prices and a gloomier global outlook since the summer, while the rest came from changes to the Bank\u2019s Brexit assumptions offset by the impact of the boost to public spending announced by Sajid Javid in September. The Bank believes the chancellor\u2019s measures will increase the level of output by 0.4%. The Bank\u2019s latest monetary policy report for the first time included precise Brexit assumptions based on the withdrawal agreement the prime minister struck with the EU. It believes leaving the EU will lead to the economy growing more slowly but had previously been basing its forecasts on the average impact over 15 years. Threadneedle Street says Boris Johnson\u2019s deal means it is now possible to quantify the effects up until the end of 2022. Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University fears that parts of the BoE\u2019s growth projections (see here) may be too optimistic: What is really striking is that Business investment growth is expected to stay flat at 0.25% in 2020 and then (magically) shoot up to to 4% in 2021 and further up to 4.5% in 2022 which appears at odds with the 3% average growth rate over the pre-crisis period! This is puzzling. For this to happen, the UK will almost certainly have to reach a great new deal with the EU which will arguably be identical to the current status quo... Dr Kerstin Braun, President of trade finance provider Stenn Group, suspects UK interest rates may be cut in early 2020. She fears that the UK economy is \u2018running out of gas\u2019, after several years of Brexit uncertainty: \u201cMark Carney is right to hold rates for now. Brexit and trade worries have been weighing on the economy and now a snap general election has been thrown into the mix. But even if we avoid a Brexit crash out, or if Brexit is scrapped all together, the UK is slowly running out of gas, driven down by persistent uncertainty and the flagging global economy. European stocks might be up after some tariffs have been rolled back, but it will take time to undo the damage caused by the trade war. \u201cThe MPC has been hinting at a rate cut for a while, with or without a confirmed Brexit deal, but it\u2019s likely to be at least three more months of paralysis before we see a move. Business investment will consequently be lacking, and thus no resulting lift to the wider economy. Sterling will likewise muddle along. \u201cThis limbo is starting to feel like \u2018the new normal\u2019 when it should only be temporary. UK businesses need to be able to withstand the burden of this longer wait.\u201d Here\u2019s Commerzbank\u2019s take on the Bank of England\u2019s growth forecast cuts, and the split over interest rates: Given the headwinds facing the UK as a result of Brexit issues and mounting global headwinds, it was perhaps no real surprise that two members of the MPC voted for a rate cut this month \u2013 the first split decision since June 2018. This comes on the back of a growth forecast that has been revised down compared to August. For the first time the BoE has explicitly outlined the assumptions underpinning its Brexit view, assuming a FTA which enables tariff-free EU goods trade but nonetheless results in other frictions that will curb trade growth. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, predicts Mark Carney could bow to pressure and extend his term again, if Brexit isn\u2019t resolved soon. She says: \u201cCarney\u2019s potentially last inflation report painted a cautiously optimistic outlook for the UK economy, but further Brexit delays could see him and business uncertainty stay for longer. \u201cThe Bank of England remains concerned about limited upside to capacity. A relatively smooth transition to new UK-EU relations, coupled with a removal of some of the current global headwinds, could therefore see interest rates start rising earlier than markets currently anticipate. \u201cHowever, with the final UK-EU trade deal likely to take some time to conclude, uncertainty is likely to last longer, causing business investment and overall economic growth to be more muted than what the BoE is expecting at the moment.\u201d The TUC is disappointed that the UK economy is now expected to be 1% smaller in 2022 than the Bank thought back in August (under those new growth forecasts). TUC Head of Economics Kate Bell blames the austerity programme implemented since 2010, saying: \u201cThis is the Conservatives\u2019 economic legacy. Their decade of cuts and under-investment has put growth in the slow lane. \u201cWhen Britain needed rebuilding, they chose austerity and tax breaks for wealthy corporations. And they have damaged confidence in our economy by threatening a reckless no-deal. \u201cWe need leaders who will put working families first, not their rich mates and donors.\u201d Both chancellor Sajid Javid and shadow chancellor John McDonnell have outlined plans to borrow and spend more if they win next month\u2019s general election: This chart, from today\u2019s Monetary Policy Report, gives a detailed view of the Bank of England\u2019s new forecasts. It shows a predicted bounce-back in business investment in 2021 and 2022, as the weight of Brexit uncertainty is lifted. But exports are seen falling in 2021 and 2022, with imports little changed. And household consumption growth, which has kept the economy growing in recent years, is expected to be lower than average Remember: These forecasts are based on the revised UK-EU Brexit deal agreed by Boris Johnson last month. Previously, the BoE assumed a smooth and orderly Brexit, and a range of potential outcomes. Economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon thinks Mark Carney should say what he really thinks about the UK\u2019s new Brexit agreement: Here\u2019s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on Mark Carney\u2019s comments about Brexit: The economics press pack then make a final attempt to pin Mark Carney down about Brexit, and the impact of Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. But it\u2019s not too successful. Q: Just to clarify.... is the Bank saying that the economy will grow faster under the Brexit deal than if we\u2019d not voted to leave, or not? That\u2019s not a question that we have to answer, Mark Carney replies. The BoE doesn\u2019t have the \u201cremit, mandate, or the luxury of comparing it to a parallel situation\u201d he adds. Q: What will happen to your forecasts after the election if Britain doesn\u2019t leave the EU? They will change, Carney smiles, moving his hands back and forth. But he won\u2019t guess how. Q: Will Brexit uncertainties rise if Britain doesn\u2019t leave the UK on 31 January next year? It depends how businesses react, says Carney. We\u2019ll adjust accordingly. It also depends how much progress is made towards defining the \u2018deep free trade deal\u2019 that both side want, he continues. That\u2019s the end of the press conference. I\u2019ll post a summary and reaction next. Q: The Labour party want the Bank of England to play a role in fiscal policy - would you welcome that? Mark Carney points out that the BoE works to a mandate, while maintaining independence from government. It needs to have targets, and the tools to achieve them. That\u2019s a hint that some problems can\u2019t be tackled through monetary policy, and financial stability measures. Back in June, Labour said the Bank could play a role in the climate emergency. It has also called for action on productivity -- which is also beyond the Bank\u2019s current remit. Q: How steep are the barriers to the Bank of England easing monetary policy, on a rating of 1 to 10? I\u2019m so not going to answer that question, Carney chuckles. But on the broad point, the Bank\u2019s economists and policymakers don\u2019t see the imbalances that push the economy into recession. If there isn\u2019t a material improvement in trade tensions, the global economy would probably stabilise, and pick up, he adds. Q: Do you think rising trade tensions are the new normal? Mark Carney replies that protectionist measures are more \u201cpersistent, pervasive and damaging\u201d than expected a few years ago. Q: Is the Bank of England more likely to cut rates next, rather than hike them, given two policymakers voted to cut rates at this week\u2019s meeting? It largely depends how risks, such as the Brexit process, play out, Carney explains. Q: What is the risk of a global recession? Mark Carney points out that world recessions are \u201cexceedingly rare\u201d. We\u2019ve only had two consecutive quarters of falling global GDP in the last 35 years (after the financial crisis), and we both lived through it, he adds. Q: How do you think the UK economy fared in the last quarter? Mark Carney says the Bank predicts growth of 0.4% for Q3 2019. We\u2019ll find out if he\u2019s right on Monday, at 9.30am, when the latest GDP figures are released. If the economy grew, then Britain will have avoided a recession (GDP fell by 0.2% in April-June). This is from Paul Brand of ITV: But as Mark Carney pointed out, the Bank still expect growth to pick up over the next few years -- just slower than previously. Q: Why have you cut your growth forecast for 2021, from 2.3% to just 1.8%? Mark Carney says there are two main factors: 1) The world is weaker; 2) UK financial conditions have tightened as the pound has strengthened. But there\u2019s also the impact of the new Brexit deal, under which \u2018transition effects\u2019 hit the UK economy more rapidly than the Bank thought before. Q: Would you extend your term beyond its end date of 31 January 2020 if the government asked you? Mark Carney says its \u201centirely understandable\u201d that his successor hasn\u2019t been appointed yet. He\u2019s sure that once the election is concluded, the process will be completed. We\u2019ll make sure that the transition is smooth and orderly, he jokes. So, he\u2019s not ruled out staying longer, if asked.... [Carney has already agreed to extend his term twice, due to Brexit] Q: Your forecasts are based on a free trade deal being agreed - but can it be done by the end of 2020, as the government says? Governor Mark Carney says it could take longer, and there could be a transition period into this new free trade deal. But he also cites comments from Pascal Lamy, former head of the WTO, who said a UK-EU trade deal could be done relatively quickly given the two sides are currently very closely aligned. [in 2017, though, Lamy said a deal couldn\u2019t be done in just two years] Q: Are you warning UK households to expect an interest rate cut? Carney says inflation is expected to fall in the short term, due to cheaper petrol and utility bills. But the bank will look through these temporary moves. Ie, the Bank wouldn\u2019t slash borrowing costs to drive prices higher, and get inflation near its 2% target again. The key message is that the Bank would \u201creinforce\u201d the economy if downside risks (global growth or Brexit uncertainty) materialise, through a rate cut. Q: How would the spending promises being made in the general election campaign affect monetary policy? Carney says that future fiscal policy is an \u2018upside risk\u2019 to today\u2019s forecasts -- in other words, growth could be stronger if governments spend more. But he doesn\u2019t critique any party\u2019s plans. Q: You previously said that Theresa May\u2019s deal was better for growth than the Bank\u2019s central forecast, so are you now saying Boris Johnson\u2019s deal is worse? Mark Carney denies it. He says the Bank never based its forecasts on May\u2019s deal as it was never approved by MPs (unlike Johnson\u2019s deal, which passed a second reading in parliament). The biggest impact of a deal, he says, is the boost from lowered uncertainty. Q: Are you assuming that the UK will leave with a deal on 31 January, and that the impact of that deal will be negative? Yes to the first point, and no to the second, Carney replies. He says growth has been very weak recently, and it\u2019s expected to pick up if Britain leaves the EU under the current deal. That growth boost would mainly be due to domestic factors. Carney then explains that the Bank might have to ease policy (cut interest rates) if global growth failed to stabilise or if Brexit uncertainties remained entrenched (as explained here). On the UK economy, Mark Carney says that business investment has been persistently weak, and there are signs that the labour market is softening. He then turns to Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. The Bank believes that growth will remain a little below potential in the near term, but will pick up afterwards. The withdrawal agreement and the extension to 31 January has lowered the perceived risk of a no-deal Brexit, and helped the pound to strengthen, Carney says. The Bank predicts that growth will pick up over the next few years, but that still leaves the economy 1% smaller in December 2022 than it expected back in August Here are the new forecasts: 2020: 1.6% growth 2021: 1.8% growth 2022: 2.1% growth Bank of England governor Mark Carney begins his press conference by warning that the global economic outlook has darkened. Carney says that the world risks slipping into \u201ca low growth, low inflation rut\u201d. But Britain now has the chance to break out of this rut, the governor adds. A Brexit deal creates the possibility of a pick-up in growth. The world economy is now expanding at its slowest rates since 2009, Carney continues. A broad-based expansion has turned into a widespread slowdown, and trade tensions are a significant cause. The Bank of England is holding a press conference now to discuss its new forecasts. You can watch it live here: The Bank of England\u2019s forecasts are now based on the revised Brexit deal agreed by Boris Johnson last month. That\u2019s significant, as the Bank has now lowered its growth forecasts for the next few years. The BoE now expects the UK economy will only grow by 1.2% this year, down from 1.3% previously. It\u2019s 2021 forecast has been cut sharply too, from 2.3% to 1.8%. Sky\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway explains: The Bank of England has risked accusations of intervening in the election campaign as it published its first formal forecast of the impact of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. In its Monetary Policy Report, the Bank forecast that over the course of the next three years the Conservative government\u2019s deal could leave the economy slightly weaker than it previously forecast. However the Bank added that there would be a near-term boost as uncertainty lifted and companies and households invested more. The Bank had previously stopped short of incorporating Theresa May\u2019s deal into its economic forecasts, choosing instead to forecast on the basis of a range of probabilities over a Brexit deal. But today it said it was now forecasting on the basis of Mr Johnson\u2019s recently-negotiated deal with Brussels, which passed its second reading in the House of Commons. The upshot, it said, was that it was now forecasting that uncertainty would lift in the near term but that the deal, which implied customs checks and regulatory divergence with European trading partners, would then come to weigh on the economy. The Bank of England has also hinted that it could cut interest rates soon, if Brexit uncertainty isn\u2019t resolved soon. The minutes of this week\u2019s minutes say: Monetary policy could respond in either direction to changes in the economic outlook in order to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target. The Committee would, among other factors, monitor closely the responses of companies and households to Brexit developments as well as the prospects for a recovery in global growth. If global growth failed to stabilise or if Brexit uncertainties remained entrenched, monetary policy might need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth and inflation. Reuters\u2019 Andy Bruce says this is a major change: The pound has fallen back to $1.282, down a third of a cent, as City traders digest the BoE decision. That\u2019s its lowest level in just over a week. The Bank of England is also gloomier about the UK\u2019s growth prospects. It now expects the UK to grow by 1% less over the next three years, compared to its August forecasts. In its latest Monetary Policy Report, just released, it says: Growth in the UK economy has been volatile this year in part because of Brexit preparations. Looking through those ups and downs, growth has slowed. We expect growth this year to be roughly half that in 2018. That is partly because growth in other countries has also slowed. Lower growth elsewhere has reduced the demand for the goods and services that the UK sells abroad. The minutes of the Bank\u2019s meeting show that Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders pushed for lower interest rates to protect the UK from the weakening global economy, and Brexit uncertainty. The Bank says: Two members preferred a 25 basis point cut in Bank Rate at this meeting. The UK economy already had a modest but rising amount of spare capacity, and core inflation was subdued. The headline unemployment rate was likely to be a lagging indicator of labour market tightness; other indicators, including vacancies and short-term unemployment, suggested that the labour market was turning. There were downside risks to the MPC\u2019s projections from a weaker world outlook and from more persistent Brexit uncertainties affecting corporate and household spending. As a result, these members judged that some extra stimulus was needed now to ensure a sustained return of inflation to the target. This is the first split interest rate decision in over a year, points out Howard Archer of the EY Item Club. Newsflash: The Bank of England has left UK interest rates unchanged, at its last monetary policy committee before the general election. But there were two dissenters! Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel both voted to cut rates back to 0.5%. But the other seven members of the MPC outvoted them, to leave BoE base rate at 0.75%. More to follow..... We\u2019ll hear the Bank of England\u2019s own assessment of the UK economy in 15 minutes, when it publishes its latest forecasts - and its interest rate decision (probably no change). Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take on the new EC growth forecasts: The European Union\u2019s executive branch has cut its growth forecasts for the 19-country eurozone for this year and next. The European Commission said Thursday that the single currency bloc is expected to grow 1.1% this year, down 0.1 percentage point from the previous forecast. And next year, growth is expected to be 0.2 percentage point lower than previously estimated 1.2%. Growth in 2021 is also expected at 1.2%. The outgoing commissioner responsible for economic affairs, Pierre Moscovici, said all European economies are set to grow over the coming two years \u201cin spite of increasingly strong headwinds.\u201d He said the fundamentals are \u201crobust\u201d and that after six years of growth, unemployment across the wider 28-country EU is at \u201cits lowest since the turn of the century.\u201d As flagged earlier, the UK is tipped to grow by 1.3% this year, and 1.4% in 2020 (a small upgrade). The EC has also forecast that Italy\u2019s budget deficit will keep growing - potentially creating another clash between Brussels and Rome. Italy\u2019s budget deficit is expected to hit 2.2% of GDP this year, above the 2% target set by the EU. It\u2019s then expected to widen, to 2.3% of economic outlook next year, and 2.7% in 2021. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has just said the EC won\u2019t take any action against Italy right now, but is pushing for structural reforms to boost growth. However, the two sides fell out badly this year after Italy\u2019s government proposed tax cuts and spending increases to pull Italy out of stagnation. This chart shows the Commission\u2019s new forecasts. The EC\u2019s Autumn Forecasts are pretty gloomy. They warn that Europe\u2019s economic outlook has deteriorated since the summer, meaning the region faces \u201ca challenging road ahead\u201d. It cites a range of factors - some temporary, others much more entrenched. They say: Economic growth in the EU is being dampened by the high level of uncertainty linked to trade tensions and by structural factors, some of which are temporary while others are more permanent. In the US, cyclical factors (supplemented by trade policy uncertainty) appear more relevant. In order to assess the factors that are weighing on economic growth, one has to distinguish between factors reflecting long-term developments (e.g. a trend decline in productivity, ageing); supply shocks (e.g. US-China trade tensions, Brexit, and temporary oil supply constraints); cyclical features (e.g. the economic cycle in the US, Asian tech cycle); structural shifts (e.g. car demand going \u2018greener\u2019, transition in China); policy effects (e.g. fading fiscal stimulus in the US); but also elevated uncertainty (e.g. related to trade policy, Brexit, and geopolitical issues). The forecasts are online here. The EC singles out Brexit as one key factor behind its weaker growth forecasts, saying: Against the background of an escalation in trade tensions, a near stagnation in international trade, and slowing global growth, the external environment has become less supportive than in recent years. Moreover, tariff threats, rising geopolitical tensions, the unknown features of Brexit, the persisting weakness of manufacturing and several structural factors have conspired to ensure a prolonged period of high uncertainty that is keeping a lid on economic growth. But it also claims that a no-deal Brexit would only have \u2018minor\u2019 impact on Europe\u2019s economy..... Asset prices could also be vulnerable to a reassessment of risks, creating vulnerabilities for the real economy. A \u2018disorderly\u2019 Brexit could dampen economic growth, particularly in the UK, but also in the EU27, though to a minor extent. The EC has also cut its growth forecasts for many largest European economics, but raised its forecast for the UK. Germany is now expected to grow by just 0.4% this year, down from 0.5% expected six months ago. German GDP is now tipped to rise by 1% in 2020, down from 1.4% previously. France\u2019s 2019 growth forecast has been trimmed to 1.3%, from 1.4%, for 2019, but maintained at 1.3% in 2020. Italy\u2019s 2020 growth forecast has been almost halved, to 0.4% from 0.7%. The EC still expects growth of just 0.1% this year. The UK, though, is expected to grow by 1.4% in 2020, up from the 1.3% expected in the Spring forecast. Growth in 2019 is still forecast at 1.3%. Here are the full forecasts for this year and next: Just in: The European Commission has cut its growth forecasts, and warned that Europe\u2019s economy faces \u2018growing headwinds\u2019. In its new autumn forecasts, the EC warns that the European and world economy have weakened over the past year. Europe has seen a sharp slowdown in external demand and a contraction in manufacturing, which is starting to spill over to other parts of the economy. While the solid performance of the labour market has helped to sustain private consumption and domestic demand, GDP growth is unlikely to rebound swiftly. The fact that growth is no longer expected to rebound meaningfully in the next two years is a major shift compared to previous forecasts and is based on the assessment that many features of the global slowdown will be persistent. The EC now expects the eurozone to grow by 1.1% this year, down from a previous estimate of 1.2%. The growth forecast for 2020 has been cut to 1.2%, from 1.4%. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici warns that Europe faces \u2018increasingly strong headwinds\u2019, including trade disputes, Brexit, and structural changes in the car industry (towards electric vehicles and self-driving cars). More to follow.... In other corporate news, UK supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s profits have been all-but-wiped out by the cost of restructuring and store closures. Pre-tax earnings for the last six months dropped to just \u00a39m, from \u00a3107m a year earlier. Underlying profits fell 15%, not helped by the 1% drop in like-for-like sales. Sophie Lund-Yates, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Sainsbury faces a tough fight in an increasingly competitive market. We\u2019ve had good news from M&amp;S\u2019 food business this week, and its deal with Ocado will just add more pressure into the mix. It begs the question: what can Sainsbury\u2019s do to differentiate itself? The integration of Argos has been a step in a new direction, but despite the cross-selling potential, it hasn\u2019t been enough to boost overall sales. German industrial giant Siemens has warned that the global economy faces a tough year. It told investors this morning (before the latest trade developments): We expect global macroeconomic development to remain subdued in fiscal 2020, with risks particularly related to geopolitical and geoeconomic uncertainties. We assume a moderate decline in market volume for our short-cycle businesses. CEO Joe Kaeser added that \u201cThe weakening of the global economy accelerated clearly during fiscal 2019\u201d. Siemens still managed to grow orders by 7% in the year, but net profits fell to \u20ac5.65bn, from \u20ac6.12bn. Every European stock market is higher this morning, driven by the prospect of the US and China rolling back some tariffs. Here\u2019s the situation after 90 minutes of upbeat trading, following Beijing\u2019s comments that trade levies could be removed in a Phase One deal. Michael Metcalfe, global head of macro strategy at State Street Global Markets, says there are clear signs of progress: \u201cMarkets are showing themselves sensitive to the precise timing of the talks and risk of delay. But progress is apparently being made and hopes that there will be partial reversal in tariffs hikes is a clear positive for equity markets. We\u2019ve had several false dawns on the trade war this year, but any agreement to start reversing prior to hikes, even in stages, is way more constructive than anything we\u2019ve seen so far.\u201d The Stoxx 600 index of European companies is at a four-year high, but only up 0.4% today. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, suggests the reaction is a little muted: One might have expected the market to spike on this news which suggests the agreement isn\u2019t clear cut. Indeed, talk of \u2018phase one\u2019 of the agreement implies this could be a long drawn-out process, hence only a muted market reaction. A trade deal can\u2019t come soon enough for German factories. Industrial production across Germany shrank by 0.6% in September, new figures show, worse than the 0.4% decline expected. That follows a 0.4% rise in August. On an annual basis, industrial production was 4.3% lower than in September 2018. This decline further fuels concerns that Germany\u2019s economy shrank in the third quarter of 2019, following a small contraction in Q2. That would put Germany into a recession. We learned yesterday that industrial orders rose in September, so industrial production could pick up in the coming months. But the picture isn\u2019t great: John Hardy of Saxo Bank says today\u2019s trade deal headlines carry more weight because they come from the Chinese side, rather than the White House. He was speaking on Saxo\u2019s daily \u2018market call\u2019 podcast, online here. His colleague Peter Garnry agrees that the news about cutting tariffs is \u2018significant\u2019, but may already be priced into markets. A trade deal should boost economic growth, but it could take up to a year for the impact to flow through, he adds. Newsflash: We\u2019re not going to get a new healthcheck on the UK economy today after all. The independent Office for Budget Responsibilities has been blocked from publishing its updated forecast, by Britain\u2019s top civil servant. These forecasts would have outlined the likely path of UK public finances, including how much needs to be borrowed in the coming years. Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill has ruled that it would have breached election rules (which prevent civil servants from doing anything political that would breach impartiality) European stock markets have jumped to their highest level since July 2015. The news that China and the US have (apparently) agreed to roll back some tariffs has sparked a rally in Frankfurt, Paris, Milan and Madrid, as well as London. This lifts the pan-European Stoxx 600 index to 406 points, a four year high. Industrial groups, miners and technology companies are all gaining ground. Germany\u2019s DAX is leading the way, up 0.7%, to its highest since January 2018. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says Beijing\u2019s comments about rolling back tariffs have boosted risk sentiment. Let\u2019s be clear \u2013 this is more of the same kind of pump we see almost daily. But it\u2019s decidedly positive nonetheless. The question remains whether the White House would be prepared to ditch all tariffs in exchange for some vague commitments on agricultural products and IP and think it can sell that as a win to voters. However, the comments from the Chinese commerce ministry do indicate a path out of the mire. Bloomberg is also reporting that China and the US have agreed to roll back some tariffs. It says: China and the U.S. have agreed to proportionally roll back tariffs on each other\u2019s goods in phases, a Ministry of Commerce spokesman said. The amount of tariff relief that would come in the first phase, set to be signed in the coming weeks, would depend on the content of that agreement, spokesman Gao Feng said Thursday without giving further details. The two sides had \u201cconstructive talks\u201d in the past two weeks, he said. If confirmed by the U.S., such an understanding could provide a road-map to de-escalate a trade war that\u2019s cast a shadow over the world economy. China\u2019s key demand since the start of negotiations has been the removal of punitive tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, which by now apply to the majority of its exports to the U.S. Stocks rallied, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index climbing 0.7% and futures on the S&amp;P 500 adding 0.5%. But.... investors should still be a little cautious, as a Phase One deal still hasn\u2019t been nailed down (let alone a comprehensive trade deal). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hopes of an imminent breakthrough in the US-China trade war are driving Britain\u2019s stock market to a five-week high this morning, as shares rally across Europe. China\u2019s commerce ministry has pumped up expectations of a deal, by revealing that both sides have agreed in principle to lift tariffs, in stages, as part of a preliminary agreement. Reuters\u2019 Beijing bureau has the details: China and the United States must simultaneously cancel some existing tariffs on each other\u2019s goods for both sides to reach a \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal, the Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday. The proportion of tariffs cancelled must be the same, and how much tariffs should be cancelled can be negotiated, said Gao Feng, spokesman at the commerce ministry. Both sides have agreed in the past two weeks to cancel the additional tariffs imposed during their months-long trade war in different phases, Gao said. Importantly, the two sides are still talking - so they\u2019ve not actually reached a Phase One deal yet. But there\u2019s relief that both sides are talking about removing some of the hurdles to trade, which have hampered the global economy for more than a year. US stock futures are also pushing higher. The latest chatter is that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping could sign the Phase One deal in December. Also coming up today The Bank of England is setting UK interest rates today, for the last time before the general election. The central bank will also publish new forecasts, which may take a gloomier view of the UK economy. Howard Cunningham, fixed income portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management, explains: \u201cThe UK market continues to be susceptible to UK politics and as such we would expect the central bank to cut growth and inflation forecasts in its Monetary Policy Report. Regardless of the forecasts in the next report, investors do not expect to see a change to interest rates until we receive some clarity on who will be running the country and their stance on Brexit. \u201cThis said, a poor economic forecast would put pressure on the central bank to introduce easing measures. The loss of momentum may even see previously hawkish members of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee acknowledge the need for a rate cut, although with just over a month until the next general election we would expect to see little change to policy this week. Today\u2019s forecasts have been rebranded as the Monetary Report, rather than the Inflation Report. There\u2019s a flurry of corporate news today. Supermarket chain Sainsbury has posted 1% fall in like-for-like sales, and a 15% drop in profits. Jet engine maker Rolls-Royce has cautioned that profits this year will come towards the \u2018lower end\u2019 of its guidance. due to ongoing problems with its Trent 1000 engine. Luxury car maker Aston Martin has posted a \u00a313.5m loss for the last quarter. Housebuilders Persimmon and Bovis, fashion chain SuperDry and bookmaker Flutter are also updating the market.
