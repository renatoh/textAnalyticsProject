Circuses, hen-nights, stupid party games, holidays where you are forced into contact with hideous, moronic reps - all should come plastered with foot-high health warnings describing just how teethgrittingly diabolical that \"fun\" activity really is. So, why try and make work more fun? Because we are not hideous, moronic holiday reps - and the office can be a billion times more fun without hiring a single bouncy castle or hilarious fancy dress outfit and playing side-splittingly funny practical jokes on the less fortunate members of the office. The secret? Don't try to schedule fun - it's often just a matter of being spontaneous. Remember: fun plus planning equals hell - fun minus planning equals heaven. Obviously, that poses an immediate problem. You're probably crumpling this page up right this second, ready to chuck it away so you can start having spontaneous fun - but stop! Unwrinkle it! Planned fun might never work, but it still needs the right environment in order to flourish. If you fill your workplace with a dourness so deeply rooted it makes Japanese knotweed look like a jolly garden friend, it's no wonder everyone goes around scowling. With that kind of attitude, any glimmer of fun will be killed stone dead. It's mostly about relaxing. To-do lists so long and binding they snake around your ankles and tie you to the chair if you so much think as nipping to the loo, are going to see off the merest twitch of a smile. Free yourself from these evil shackles: have manageable targets and make enough time in your day for the important things: a lunchtime stroll, afternoon screen break, and - gasp! - jolly interaction with someone that does not involve email. Ditto over-restrictive clothing. All trussed up in an ill-fitting suit? You're unlikely to be doing any cartwheels round the office, or leaping for joy when you're limbs are literally pinned down. So, loosen that tie a little; kick off those heels. Let yourself feel the friendliness that oozes from your body language once you take a break from being so, well, completely uptight. Because friendliness, my, um, friends, is what really matters. How can anyone have fun when the whole office is so busy being important and stressed that everyone is ignoring each other? Build friendships, have conversations, seek out people whom you might otherwise ignore - and laugh a bit. Try a joke. Even, and I know this might be pushing things a little, suggest an activity for colleagues to do together (NB - remember the misery of organised fun. Particularly, say, paintballing or other team-building activity. I imagine going to the pub or out for lunch might be as much fun as you need). In no time, you'll be actively looking forward to the offi ce and the wildly social nature of your working day. Just one thing. I really, really don't want to spoil the party, but you do go to work to, actually, well, work. So, be relaxed; but be relaxed and efficient - and maybe keep that snorty, cackling laugh for very special jokes. Maybe even ones that don't happen in the office. After all, if there's one thing that's no fun at all, it's getting fired."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
