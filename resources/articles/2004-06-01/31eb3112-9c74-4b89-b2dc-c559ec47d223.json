One of many highlights was an early interruption by BBC1 controller Lorraine Heggessey. \"Can you name the controller\" ... \"Me, me, it's me,\" bellowed Ms Heggessey, bounding up and down. \"of BBC2...\" Better luck next time, Lorraine. \u00b7 In an age of mud-wrestling on Big Brother, it's reassuring to know that an old-fashioned hour of badgers, blue tits and barn owls can still pull in the punters. BBC2's Britain Goes Wild with Bill Oddie had nearly 4 million viewers last week. But there's no chance of ITV or Channel 4 copying its success - its appeal to the over-45s, pensioners and social groups CD and E means a commercial broadcaster wouldn't touch it. Public service broadcasting, eh? \u00b7 Monkey was intrigued by Standard editor Veronica Wadley's insistence last week that Nicola Jeal left the paper - one of several executives to do so - because she \"wanted to work part-time\" after having a baby. Funny, because Jeal, who was assistant editor (features), now works full-time editing the marvellous Observer Food Monthly as well as doing consultancy work for Emap. \u00b7 And so to the Church of England newspaper, in which columnist Andrew Carey made a whingeing defence of his dad, former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey's revelations of private counselling sessions with Camilla Parker Bowles. \"There was nothing new in the story,\" was the unfortunate headline on the piece, in which Andrew said his father didn't give away any pastoral secrets. Does that mean that they'll be giving back the money the Times paid to serialise the old boy's lacklustre memoirs? After all, it was the nearest the paper came to a scoop from them ... \u00b7 \"Everyone's concentrating on Euro 2004 but Manchester United are already talking about the next Premiership campaign,\" said a Sky News update. By curious coincidence, Sky has rights to the Premiership but not Euro 2004. \u00b7 Channel 4 is hoping its planned radio station refreshes the parts that doomed breakfast show RI:SE failed to reach. In the first venture of its kind, Channel 4 bosses are concentrating all their resources on the breakfast slot, broadcasting music to a youthful audience and using the digital airwaves to cross promote its peak evening programmes. Well, if it's good enough for the BBC, why not C4? \u00b7 The Guardian Student Media Awards close on July 9.
