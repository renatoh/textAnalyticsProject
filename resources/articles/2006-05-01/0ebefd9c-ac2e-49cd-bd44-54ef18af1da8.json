The comment pages in print are crowded; lots of people with interesting views were denied a platform; the web was the obvious place to go. Setting up CiF as a collective, group blog was, to my un-web-educated eye, more a practical solution than a philosophical one. We wanted to recruit hundreds of people - academics, politicians, scientists, environmentalists, writers, etc - and encourage them to blog as and when they wanted. We wanted to foster all shades of opinion. We had a tiny budget - a fraction of that spent on the paper comment pages - so we needed to offer freedom and space to write instead of big fees. We also wanted to get our professional columnists to engage with readers by allowing people to comment instantly on their articles, but I admit I thought only in passing about reader reaction and the kind of conversation the site might provoke online. What I did not foresee was that two months on I would find myself in the middle of a raging argument about professionalism versus amateurism - with sub-headings covering language, anonymity, accountability, democracy, censorship and the art of conversation. For those who have dwelt in the world of bloggers for years, none of this will come as a surprise. But for journalists who have spent a lifetime in print - like me and most Guardian columnists - it has been a rude shock. On good days I think this is the most exciting new frontier for journalism - the immediacy of the debate, the excitement at watching readers engage with the big (and occasionally trivial) issues of the day with wit, verve and insight make print seem sluggish, out of date, even a bit dull. Other days, when I have spent hours removing the anti-semitism and Islamophobia that dances round any piece about Israel/Palestine, and the incoherent abuse, the swearing, the false statements, the ill-disguised misogyny, the intimidation and the downright nastiness that fuels so many comments, I wonder whether Guardian values - free comment, but fair comment too - are in danger of being drowned out in an anarchic, unmoderated medium populated, it seems, by weird men. I look with fondness at the rigorously edited paper, and the polite discourse on the letters page. The answer for most media companies developing blogs (although no one is doing anything quite like Comment is free) is to pre-moderate comments. We have deliberately decided against that, only requiring commenters to register, because we want to keep the conversation as free-flowing as possible. So what to do? Stung by one particularly brutal comment on a piece by a young Muslim woman we had recruited to blog, I did what Emily Bell, editor of Guardian Unlimited, advised and entered the fray myself. Why, I asked in an end-of-the- week post, was it necessary for commenters to personally abuse those with whom they disagreed? Why did so many resort to swearing to make their point? Would they behave like this if they weren't hiding behind the anonymity of their screen names? Some of the response was predictable (you can read it at http://commentisfree.theguardian.com/georgina_henry/2006/05/post_84.html) - but I was struck by how thoughtful others were. And funny. Commenters whose names struck fear in me when I saw them popping up on our bloggers threads turned out to be unexpectedly reasonable. While they fiercely defended their right to take on the professionals, there were many useful bits of advice about the rules of engagement. Last week Jackie Ashley and Polly Toynbee joined in. Ashley robustly defended professional columnists - in her case, with 25 years of experience of political reporting. She wasn't claiming that she always knew more than her readers, but the least they could do was tell her so without insulting her. Toynbee attacked the anonymity of commenters and the aggression of their discourse - and revealed the contents of a particularly obnoxious email she had received that morning. (She got quite a lot of sympathy in return.) Both got plaudits from some of their fiercest critics for getting down and dirty and joining the discussion. Is Bell right that the way to raise the standard of debate on the site is to engage properly with readers? In the long term we may look at some system that helps us to rate comments to keep out the dross, but in the meantime, I am all for engagement - it has been an education. Two results so far. Guardian columnnists have taken to heart that blogging is about more than just writing your piece and disappearing once the conversation starts. They have started, as a matter of course, going back into the debates they have generated to talk to their readers. Second, we have just announced the five nominations in Big Blogger - the competition we are running to find the best \"amateur\" commenter on the site, who will then become one of CiF's full-time bloggers. Inevitably it has been accompanied by lurid warnings from some hard-core commenters not to be seduced by the mainstream media - there are plenty of people out there who consider us interlopers and who refuse to accept that there could be a blurring of lines. But hundreds of readers have joined in to nominate their favourite commenter. The five will now compete in a process of elimination over the next five weeks. So, will the competition be a significant breach in the divide between the professional and the amateur? Or it will be a case, as one of my respondents put it, of the lunatics finally taking over the asylum? We shall see."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
