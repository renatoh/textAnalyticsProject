Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told the House armed services committee, that the Pentagon was committed to discovering whether Russian military intelligence had paid for attacks on American soldiers in Afghanistan. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get to the bottom of this bounty thing. If in fact there are bounties, I\u2019m an outraged general, just like every one of us in uniform is,\u201d Milley said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real big deal. We don\u2019t have that level of fidelity yet, but we\u2019re still looking.\u201d He suggested that the US may not be responding to the reports as robustly as necessary in non-military ways. \u201cThe issue is at the strategic level,\u201d he said. \u201cIs there diplomatic, and informational and economic \u2026 sanctions, are there d\u00e9marches, are there phone calls, is there pressure, those sorts of things. And I can tell you that some of that is done. Are we doing as much as we could or should? Perhaps not, not only to the Russians but to others.\u201d The defence secretary, Mark Esper, who was testifying alongside Milley, said that the original reports did not come from any of the nine of the total of 17 US intelligence agencies under Pentagon\u2019s authority, implying the information leaked to the press in recent weeks came from the CIA or another civilian agency. Esper said the reports were first reviewed by the Pentagon in January, when they were shown to Milley and the head of US central command, Gen Kenneth McKenzie, and the defence secretary became aware of them in February. \u201cThey got some initial reporting on the ground that they began pursuing. Neither thought the reports were credible, as they dug into them,\u201d Esper said. Milley stressed that the investigation was not over. \u201cI and the secretary and others are taking it seriously,\u201d the general said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get to the bottom of it. When I find out if, in fact, it\u2019s true. And if it is true, we will take action.\u201d Donald Trump has insisted he was not briefed on the Russian bounties. It has been reported that the suspicions were summarised in written form as part of the president\u2019s daily brief, but the national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, has said it was the decision of the CIA briefer not to present them verbally. Intelligence officials are reported to have been reticent in passing on negative information about Russian activities to Trump because of his angry reaction. So far, the Trump administration has not announced any retaliatory action. At the same congressional hearing, Milley made strong remarks on the impact of having 10 army bases in the US named after Confederate military leaders, whom he described as traitors. Trump has said he would not even consider renaming the bases, but Milley said the symbolism of the names represented a challenge to the cohesion of the US armed forces, which are 43% minority. He added that the US army was 20% African American, rising to 30% at some bases. He recalled having a staff sergeant at Fort Bragg who told him he had to go to work every day at a base named after a man, Confederate Gen Braxton Bragg, who had enslaved his grandparents. The Confederacy, Milley told the committee, \u201cwas an act of rebellion. It was an act of treason at the time, against the Union, against the Stars and Stripes, against the US constitution, and those officers turned their back on their own.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
