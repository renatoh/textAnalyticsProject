Peterson is not hurt and it takes until round three for him to realise targeting the champion with powerful body shots will be his best hope of success Rounds 4-6 Peterson stays inside and has the better of the close combat. The fight evens out in the fifth with Khan \u2013 who slips and ends up on the canvas \u2013 boxing cleverly on the back foot, trading blows from a distance. Khan is shading it at halfway, landing rapid combinations and moving away quickly before the challenger can get close enough to connect Round 7 Peterson goes into full-on assault mode, brawling aggressively and drawing blood from Khan's nose with a vicious uppercut as he pins the champion against the ropes. Khan is forced to push Peterson off him and is controversially docked a point by the referee, Joe Cooper, in a great round for the hometown boxer Rounds 8-9 Peterson stays on top in the eighth, slugging at Khan's body and escaping a penalty for a low blow. Khan stays centre ring in the ninth, increasing his work rate and hurting Peterson with some blistering three- and four-punch combinations that keep his tough opponent at bay and quieten the partisan crowd Rounds 10-11 Peterson gets in Khan's face, forcing him back on to the ropes, where he is least comfortable. Khan lands some heavy hooks, sucking up the pressure and punching on the counter with power and precision. Khan shades round 10 but the 11th is as even as the fight at this stage, Khan scoring with volume from centre ring and Peterson winning the energy-sapping brawls at the ropes Round 12 Both boxers open up in an attempt to win the fight, with wild hooks traded in the round's early exchanges. Khan covers up as Peterson goes at his body and shoves the American off with his left forearm. Cooper docks him a point to the dismay of his trainer, Freddie Roach. Khan moves more sharply thereafter and dominates his opponent with a flurry of rapid-fire combinations and greater energy. The challenger is dogged but dog-tired too. A good round for Khan, save for the second controversial \u2013 and ultimately crucial \u2013 deduction of a point Verdict There are half-hearted celebrations from both boxers as the bell rings, reflecting what a close contest it has been. A six-minute wait for the scores to be announced adds to the tension and confusion in both camps. Khan puffs his cheeks out and turns to his corner with a look of bewilderment on his face as he loses the split decision How the judges scored it George Hill, 12-113 Valerie Dorsett, 112-113 Nelson Vasquez, 115-110"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
