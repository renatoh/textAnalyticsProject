Kasper Schmeichel described Leicester\u2019s performance as \u201cunacceptable\u201d and the club\u2019s wider predicament as \u201cembarrassing\u201d, as he warned his team-mates that, if they did not improve, they would be relegated. As United ended a run of three successive draws in the Premier League to close to within two points of fourth-placed Arsenal, Leicester lost for the fourth time in a row in the competition and the defending champions sit only one point above the relegation zone. Henrikh Mkhitaryan made the difference for United, putting them in front on 41 minutes and it was 3-0 and game over by the 49th minute. \u201cFor the first 40 minutes we played OK but after that it was unacceptable,\u201d Schmeichel, Leicester\u2019s goalkeeper, said. \u201cIt is not good enough and sums our season up at the moment. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about last season. It\u2019s gone. There are a lot of factors that go into it but this season has not been good right from the start. \u201cWe are a group of players low on confidence but not low on fight. It is not a comfortable situation. It has been terrible, embarrassing. It is time for each one of us \u2013 from the top to the bottom of this club \u2013 to stand up and be counted. If we don\u2019t, we will be relegated.\u201d Ranieri, who faces a critical week in which Leicester face Derby County in the FA Cup and fellow strugglers Swansea City in the league \u2013 with a Champions League tie against Sevilla also to come \u2013 commented how \u201clast season everything was right for us; this season everything is wrong\u201d, but he maintained he had not lost the dressing room. \u201cWe are together,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the players are unhappy, they can go and see the chairman but no one has done that.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Mourinho talked about how United\u2019s ruthlessness had been decisive \u2013 they scored with their second, third and fourth clear chances \u2013 which was a change from many matches this season, and he said that he did not \u201cwant to be the manager of a team that plays very well, creates a lot of chances and doesn\u2019t win matches\u201d. Mourinho also said there had been a change of perception in England about how to analyse a performance such as his team had put in here. \u201cMy team is playing very well,\u201d the manager said, after a 15th league game without defeat. \u201cBut for many, many years in my career \u2013 especially in this country \u2013 when my teams were ruthless and when my teams were phenomenal defensively and very good on the counterattack, I listened week after week that it was not enough, in spite of winning the title three times. It looks like this season, to be phenomenal defensively and good on the counterattack, is art. It is a big change in England.\u201d On Mkhitaryan, whom Mourinho switched from the left flank to the No10 role midway through the first half, he said: \u201cYes, we improved [after the tactical change] but then, it\u2019s his goal that changes the story of the game. \u201cSometimes, when we don\u2019t play players [as Mourinho did not with Mkhitaryan at the start of the season], we protect them and he was one of those players. He was adapting. And I could see not just what you see \u2013 because you see the magic things he can do on the pitch \u2013 but I also see other things that I want to see. He is playing really well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
