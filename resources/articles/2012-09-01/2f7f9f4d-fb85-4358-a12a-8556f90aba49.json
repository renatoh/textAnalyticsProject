It is early 2009 and the world economy is in freefall. The shock waves from the collapse of Lehman Brothers are still reverberating and the economic indicators - trade, industrial production, unemployment - are comparable to the early stages of the Great Depression in the early 1930s. Central banks have slashed interest rates to the bone and finance ministries have allowed budget deficits to widen. Yet policymakers believe more is needed to arrest the slump and so they delve into the history books to come up with something known as quantitative easing. The Federal Reserve in the United States and the Bank of England decide that they will buy large quantities of bonds from the financial markets to supplement the boost to activity provided by cuts in short-term interest rates. QE is designed to be a double-whammy. Firstly, the price of a bond moves inversely to the yield (interest rate) that it generates. Taking bonds out of the market reduces supply and pushes up the price. The interest rate comes down, making long-term borrowing cheaper for companies and householders with fixed-rate mortgages. Secondly, the institutions that hand over their bonds to the central banks get money in return, and they can use this to buy other assets such as shares. Rising equity prices help to restore business and consumer confidence. In one important respect, QE did the trick, because without it there is no telling what would have happened to the global economy in the winter of 2008-09. By the summer of 2009 there was clear evidence that the decline in output had bottomed out. Fears of a Great Depression 2 were scotched. And yet, QE was supposed to be a temporary measure, with the process reversed once the global economy returned to normal. Far from that happening, central banks kept on buying bonds. The Bank of England is on its fourth round of QE; the Fed is about to embark on its third. Despite an unprecedented stimulus, the global economy is losing momentum. Some argue that the harmful side-effects of QE are partly to blame for this, since the money created by bond buying has led to speculation in commodity markets, driving up the price of food and fuel, and hence hitting the spending power of consumers. Others wonder whether QE is now bumping up against the law of diminishing returns, with each round of bond buying less effective than the last. Certainly, if QE does not work soon then more radical measures - such as so-called drops of \"helicopter money\" on to the economy - will be canvassed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
