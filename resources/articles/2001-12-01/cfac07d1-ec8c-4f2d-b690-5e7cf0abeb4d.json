The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) announced the failed dope test in Monaco on November 25, a month after Sotomayor's retirement. The South American is the third high-profile sportsman to fail such a test recently along with the Italian-based footballers Jaap Stam and Pep Guardiola. \"I know everyone generally says they are innocent,\" said Sotomayor. \"But in my case I am. That substance can never have reached my body.\" The former athlete, whose world record stands at 2.45metres, won a gold medal at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. Sotomayor received a two-year ban in 1999 after testing positive for cocaine at the Pan-American Games in Winnipeg but that was reduced to allow him to take part in Sydney 2000. He went on to win silver. He has always pleaded his innocence, claiming he had been the victim of a plot. To help combat such scandals the World Anti-Doping Agency appointed Norway's Rune Andersen as its director of standards yesterday. Andersen previously spent 12 years as head of the Norwegian Olympic Committee's department for anti-doping."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
