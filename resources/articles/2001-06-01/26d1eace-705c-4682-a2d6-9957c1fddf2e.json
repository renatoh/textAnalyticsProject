Noble physically, the Conservative chairman's nostrils are now the great hope of party activists because, as he repeatedly said yesterday, they scent that the opinion polls are wrong. \"I follow my nose,\" he reiterated after the nth press conference question about the witchdoctors of Mori, ICM and Gallup. So do we all, but the Ancram nose has genuine political predic \"My nose told me that the polls were wrong in the last local elections and the Euro-election,\" said the chairman. \"And my nose was right.\" Mr Hague's brain has also got a formidable pedigree of Oxford first et al, but yesterday it appeared to show a range that made obituaries of the Tory leader look premature. The two main parties were both ambushed along the lines of the 1997 Name the Spice Girls challenge, which saw Tony Blair beat John Major 3-2. What a reversal this time! At Labour's morning conference the party's final week mantra of \"schools hospitals schools hospitals schools...\" was derailed by the odd decision to field David Blunkett on the stump with the cast of Channel 4's soap Hollyoaks. \"Can you bring us up-to-date on current events in Hollyoaks?\" Messrs Blair and Brown were sweetly asked. They knew nix (and that in spite of the fact that Cherie Blair had presided over the Soap of the Year awards only the previous night and presented a lifetime achievement award to Hollyoaks' creator, Phil Redmond). It was a missed opportunity, with the cast including a likeable lad called Toni and a Geri who yearns to be famous. On the Hague bus, it was very different as a pair of teenie-scouts from BBC 1's Newsround quizzed the Conservative leader on youth culture icons: who won Popstars? (\"Hear'Say ... Ffion watched more of it than I did.\") What's a muggle? (\"A non-wizard person from Harry Potter.\") What's the current No 1? (\"Pied Piper's Do You Really Like It.\") D'you prefer Pokemon or Microstars? (\"Microstars.\") He got everything right, but was it a fair playing field? Rumours persisted - and were denied - that the mini-reporters' previous quizzing of Plaid Cymru and the SNP's top men had been picked up by Conservative central office, whose eyes are as keen as their chairman's nose. He and Ffion have yet to make their own direct contribution to modern youth culture, of course - though that can be a two-edged sword as the Blairs found out after their son Euan's escapade last summer in Leicester Square. Yesterday, the 17-year-old emerged in a different light, as one of four new deputy head boys at the Oratory school. But will that win his father as much youth cred as the heavy night out apparently did? It's a relevant subject, because fresh claims of an unfulfilled Labour pledge have extended into the world of drink, with the Campaign for Real Ale complaining that the Full Pint Promise has not been honoured. In the last, vote-winning days before the 1997 poll, the party guaranteed that every pint pulled under Labour would be 100% beer, not partly frothy head. Legislation has never happened. These things are very hard to read in electoral terms, however. In Yorkshire most of us prefer to keep that nice creamy head. Similarly, Hague's triumph in the Newsround quiz (in which Blair and Kennedy did much worse) may simply brand him in young eyes as a swot. Certainly, yesterday brought more evidence of the unmessianic, hard-nosed nature of this election as 5% of respondents to an internet poll said that they wanted \u00a320 or tea and cakes at the polling station before they would vote. A similar number were even more hardline: they claimed they would rather go on holiday with their mother-in-law in a caravan. Such dark moments for democracy were balanced by the occasional ray of virtuous light, notably from Helen John, who is fighting Mr Blair's Sedgefield seat on an anti-star wars ticket from her cell at Askham Grange jail. Like John Bunyan, the 63-year-old retired midwife is putting her en forced leisure to good use: although she cannot canvass in person, the prison telephone has been well used. Askham, near York, is further from Sedgefield than the County Durham closed prison where she was initially sent to serve three months for snipping through security wire at the potential Star Wars base of Menwith Hill. But it is an open prison with a liberal tradition, and hopes are high that Ms John's request for ticket of leave to attend the June 7 count with Mr Blair will not be refused. If so, she had better take a brolly, according to the met office, which predicts an end to the campaign sunshine. Polling day will be different, they predict, featuring the sort of cool, windy, showery weather that marked Margaret Thatcher's first victory in 1979. Historically, they also note that her second term election saw dreary showers, while Labour won last time on a universally dry and largely sunny day. Out on the battlebuses, meanwhile, a theory emerged for the strange meanderings that yesterday saw Charles Kennedy's yellow coach travel to Paignton, Birmingham and Southport. The Lib Dems' computer has a persistent fault which adds half the previous day's itinerary to the printout for the daily route. The Hague convoy's relative consistency is put down, of course, to Mr Ancram's nose for direction, which will deserve a memorial if the underdogs pull off a surprise. A good model would be the enormous beak jutting out of a St Petersburg house in honour of Gogol's story of a nose so talented that it goes off on its own. There is just room for a cast of it on the front of central office in Smith Square.
