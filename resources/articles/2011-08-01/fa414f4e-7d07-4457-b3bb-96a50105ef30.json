In it, he and wife Shane embarked on their mission from the starting point of the Cornwall coast. He still seems borderline phobic of what the sea has to throw at him, but the moments of serenity are worth the foaming torment. Back behind the wheel, he and Shane leave Cardiff for the wildly unpredictable Irish Sea. Ben Arnold The Sopranos 9pm, Sky Atlantic Season three, which starts tonight, is often seen as one of the best this show had to offer, which is quite some acclaim. The previous season ended with Pussy getting bumped off, showing the audience that not even the main characters are safe here, adding a lot of real danger and tension to what follows. We rejoin the regular, everyday mafia folk as they keep business as usual under the close eye of the law. It's a great opener, showing just how the hoods are perceived by the feds. Phelim O'Neill Who Do You Think You Are? 9pm, BBC1 Dot Cotton herself, June Brown, delves into her past to discover if her bloodline really does qualify her as an EastEnder. She sits around the dinner table with her family before her journey begins and holds court. \"I don't expect to weep, although I will have some waterproof mascara,\" she says with a fag on the go. Her first link with the past is Isaac Bitten, an East End prize fighter she knows is a relative. He took part in an epic 74-round punch-up on Wimbledon Common, after which he retired to become enormously fat. This one's a goody. Julia Raeside 24 Hours in A&amp;E 9pm, Channel 4 As this riveting fly-on-the-wall documentary series draws to a close, the focus perhaps appropriately turns to the mind, as patients flood London's King's College A&amp;E department with various neurological problems. The unit receives more psychological emergencies than any other in the country. Tonight, both a 16-year-old boy and an alcoholic former shop manager arrive, having suffered suspected strokes. As always, the inspirational professionalism of the staff is played with pitch-perfect balance alongside the often heart-breaking stories of the patients. BA Forbidden Love 9pm, National Geographic Plenty of loves that dare not speak their names, but are quite happy to appear on telly, in this new series looking at people finding love in the darndest places. We meet a man who really loves his cars (they have their licence plates blurred to protect their identities and resale value). We also meet a woman who has fallen for a building. At least it's not going to run off with another lover: judging by the state of the building, it was lucky to have anyone interested in it at all. These are all lonely, arguably damaged people, and once you get past the silliness it's all rather crushingly sad. PO'N"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
