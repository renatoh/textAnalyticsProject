There'll be plucky delights from US virtuoso Bob Brozman, \"Dostoevskyan skiffle\" from the Bobby McGees, and the harmonious sound of 60 nippers from Whytemead First School strumming a commissioned work by the High Llamas' Sean O'Hagan. Meanwhile, workshops for all ages and abilities will allow participants to learn new chord patterns and techniques, or even wallow in the banjolele blues. The event culminates in a giant \"ukeathon\" on Sunday; all playing styles welcome. Worthing Assembly Hall &amp; St Paul's Centre, Fri to 10 Oct, wukulelefestival.com Colette Bernhardt Doctor Who Live, On tour Whovians need not wait till Christmas for a fix; it's about to hit the stage. There's a predictable imminent cataclysm and the promise of classic villains, including those iPod-coloured Daleks. Director Will Brenton recently confirmed that this live extravaganza will be a sequel to 1973's Carnival Of Monsters, in which miniaturised life forms trapped in a hi-tech peepshow escape and grow back to full size. Those pining for Amy Pond may be left disappointed as none of the regular actors will appear live. But \u2013 hey! \u2013 there'll be special effects, fireworks and an orchestra on stage. Wembley Arena, HA9, Fri to 10 Oct, see doctorwholive.com Colin Shek Margate International Kite Festival Visitors to the seaside don't usually have a bracing wind at the top of their list of desirable weather conditions, but an autumnal squall will certainly liven up this gathering of kite flyers from across the globe. International experts will put on displays of their individual styles, with aerobatics and synchronised flying skills on show throughout the weekend. There's a children's kite treasure hunt and younger members of the audience will also enjoy the display of inflatable kites in the shapes of the Blue Peter teddy bear, Asterix and Daffy Duck.
