We asked for a book to cheer us up and there\u2019s no question that this one is making a promise in its title. Last year, it won the Bollinger Wodehouse prize for comic fiction, as well as warm and appreciative reviews in the UK and the US. Sam Leith called it \u201cpitch perfect\u201d in the Guardian, while Susan Coll wrote in the New York Times that it was \u201cso dense with amusing detail that I thought about holding the book upside down to see if any extra funny bits might spill from the creases between the page\u201d. The book is the third featuring Stibbe\u2019s fictional alter ego Lizzie Vogel, but you don\u2019t have to have read the others first (Man at the Helm and Paradise Lodge). Set in 1980, 18-year-old Lizzie leaves her mother \u2013 a \u201cdrunk, divorcee, nudist, amphetamine addict, nymphomaniac, shoplifter, would-be novelist, poet, playwright\u201d \u2013 and leaves the family home to start a job at a dental surgery. Moving into the flat above her new workplace, she plans to learn about sex, not to write a novel \u2013 but we\u2019ll get on to that later. I\u2019d be tempted to describe the book as vintage Stibbe, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that she rose to fame just seven years ago when she published her first book, Love, Nina. The debut was a selection of the letters she wrote to her sister while working as a nanny for Mary-Kay Wilmers, a founding editor of the London Review of Books, in the 1980s, where they shared a street with literary celebrities including Alan Bennett. It was also turned into a successful (and very funny) TV series. Since then she\u2019s been on a hot streak, publishing four more successful novels (in addition to the Lizzie Vogel books, she\u2019s also written An Almost Perfect Christmas) and quickly building a reputation as one of the UK\u2019s most talented and beloved comic writers. You can listen to her being brilliant about what it means to be a \u201cfunny woman\u201d on the Guardian books podcast, and equally charming in a \u201cramblechat\u201d with comedian and podcaster Adam Buxton. The book itself has been made into an audiobook, is widely available as an ebook and the paperback is available online in the UK through Waterstones, hive.co.uk and the wide range of independent bookstores that are still shipping here in the UK. I know it may take a little while to get hold of books so we\u2019ll leave the discussion open a bit longer than usual each week. The good news is that when you do manage to get a copy, it is a quick and delightful read. Or at least, that\u2019s how it seems to me after the first 20 pages; I\u2019m already laughing and squirming at the descriptions of dental procedures. I\u2019m looking forward to reading more and I hope you\u2019ll join me \u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
