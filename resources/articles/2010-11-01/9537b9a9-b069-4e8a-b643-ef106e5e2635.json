The story of a smug lecturer whose career is destroyed by semantics had an incendiary effect. Can a verbal assault be construed as rape? Or given Mamet's dazzling play on the ambiguity of language, does it constitute any situation where no is taken to mean yes? Though the linguistic brilliance remains undiminished, the play's premise has eroded over time. The problem lies with an early scene in which the lecturer grapples with a female student: no one in a position of authority would seem so bewildered to find themselves facing disciplinary action for that today. Juliet Forster's production locates the action in the present, as the use of mobile phones and laptops indicates. More controversially, she locates it in the UK, which creates more problems than it solves. The lecturer makes calls to his \"realtor\", rather than his estate agent, while the academic-job-for-life system critical to the plot is a US construct. Although the jittery mannerism of \"Mamet-speak\" has become a cliche worth challenging, the rhythmic snap of the dialogue is so unnatural to British cadences it simply sounds as if you are listening to it at the wrong speed. Kevin McGowan and Claire-Louise Cordwell acquit themselves well, despite being required to spin the desk between scenes in a clunky piece of choreography. For a play about the dangers of patronage, it's curious not to trust the audience to see the tables turn for themselves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
