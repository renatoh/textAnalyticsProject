Dale Reid's team could hardly have dreamed up a better start to their campaign to win the trophy for the first time on American soil when they moved into a 3-1 lead. And it was Davies, the former world No1, who provided the perfect lead for the holders. With Davies powering the ball from the tee and the Spanish rookie Paula Marti slotting home a string of crucial putts, the inspired pair won the top match by two holes against the best of the Americans, Juli Inkster and Laura Diaz. Helen Alfredsson and Suzann Pettersen then added another point with a 4&amp;2 dismissal of Kelly Robbins and Pat Hurst, while the ever-reliable world No1 Annika Sorenstam and her fellow Swede, Carin Koch, beat Meg Mallon and Kelli Kuehne 3&amp;2. For the Americans Beth Daniel, the oldest player here at 45, and Wendy Ward forestalled a repeat of the foursomes whitewash from Loch Lomond two years ago by defeating Iben Tinning and Raquel Carriedo by one hole. The Scot Reid, who captained Europe to the 2000 win, had her overnight prayers answered when Davies and Marti provided the ideal start. The pair completed the round in 67, six under par, and saved the absolute best for last. At the 522-yard 18th, Davies hit a 302-yard drive straight down the middle and then Marti blasted a three-wood second shot 220 yards to nine feet for an eagle putt that was conceded when the American failed to make four. \"I said that Paula [Marti] would be a star of this Solheim Cup and she proved it today,\" said Reid. \"I've known all along that she was a great player and today her putting was just out of this world.\" Koch, who won all her three matches at Loch Lomond, maintained her 100% record with a superb display with Sorenstam, a friend from childhood. They covered the 16 holes in five under without a bogey on the card. Alfredsson may have been a controversial pick, but she once again proved to be a wise head, rising to the occasion as she joined the rookie Pettersen in a fighting victory. All square after 10 holes, the Europeans birdied the next six and won the 12th, 14th, 15th and 16th to seize the morning's third point."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
