The head of the Scotland Yard investigation, Assistant Commissioner John Yates, is reported to be unhappy that one plank of his investigation under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act 2000, on whether the parties obtained hidden donations by getting uncommercial loans, appears to have been wrecked by the inaction of the watchdog. The Guardian has learnt that it would be virtually impossible to prosecute the Labour and the Conservative parties on this matter because the commission repeatedly failed to provide advice on exactly what a commercial rate of interest was - and therefore, parties can hardly be accused of breaking the law if no one provided them with proper guidedlines. The evidence for this comes in a recent report by the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, chaired by Sir Alistair Graham (Look at the 11th report, pages 32-35). This makes it clear that, despite being challenged by Dr Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, president of the International Political Science Association, in the run-up to the last election, the Electoral Commission, declined to clarify its view on a commercial rate of interest for political loans. Instead, the commission relied on advice it had already issued for the 2001 election campaign which is silent on the matter. No action to issue clear guidance was made until 2006 by which time the issue had become a major public controversy after Jack Dromey, Labour party treasurer, had revealed that he knew nothing about millions of pounds of secret loans made to Labour during the election campaign and the police had launched an investigation into the cash-for-honours inquiry. The committee concluded that \"the commission should have provided guidance far earlier than it did on what it considered a commercial loan\". This is going to be reinforced on Thursday when Sir Hayden Phillips' report into party funding will say the commssion must provide an opinion on issues when requested by the parties. The smoking gun on the collapse of any prosecution is that the committee gave all its evidence to Mr Yates and he did not ban its publication. It is also understood that Scotland Yard was able to read the report and the committee offered to withold any findings that would jeopardise any future prosecution. This particularly applied to its findings on advice on commercial loans which, in one Whitehall source's words, would be \"a gift to a defence barrister\" fighting any case brought by the police. Given the alacrity of Mr Yates' rush to the attorney general to get an injunction when the BBC threatened to reveal the embarassing email to protect their chances of a prosecution, it now seems that Mr Yates realised that a prosecution was very unlikely or the passage would have been omitted from the report. The Guardian has also been told by a senior Conservative party source that its compliance officer was in regular touch with the Electoral Commission in the run-up to the election on the loans the party was taking out from donors and supporters. No objections were raised by the Electoral Commission. The Electoral Commission said it could not issue any comment because of the ongoing police investigation into the cash-for-honours affair. But a spokeswoman did point out that the commission has subsequently condemned political parties for breaking the \"spirit of the law\" by not being transparent about the loans they had received. The suspicion is that the Electoral Commission was a watchdog that failed to bark when it should."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
