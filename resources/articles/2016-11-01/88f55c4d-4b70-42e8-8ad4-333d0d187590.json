As well as offering the extra lineout option Eddie Jones may yet need against South Africa next week, the Northampton flanker boasts a black belt in jujutsu which should give him a slight advantage when England return to their judo mats in the Algarve this week. The multidimensional Wood, who also enjoys archery and off-roading, was a keen martial arts exponent as a youngster before he entered full-time rugby. \u201cI started at seven or eight,\u201d he said. \u201cI did a bit of karate to start with before some new guys came into our club with a jujutsu background. I did it until I was 13 and was a black belt. I loved it at the time until rugby got a bit too serious.\u201d Given Jones\u2019s enthusiasm for judo-based training, despite a flurry of injuries at England\u2019s last get-together in Brighton, it could be that Wood, who turns 30 on Thursday, has finally re-emerged in the right place at the right time following a year\u2019s exile from the national squad. Jones was impressed with his latest contribution for the Saints in the win over Gloucester last Friday and likes the attitude of the long-haired warrior \u2013 \u201cHe looks like Rambo, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d \u2013 who last featured for England at the 2015 Rugby World Cup. Wood was as deflated as anyone by the host nation\u2019s premature exit from the tournament but, having been bluntly told by Jones he needed to improve in all areas \u2013 he was informed by the new England coach his form had been \u201cdistinctly average\u201d \u2013 his determination to fight his way back has not gone unnoticed. \u201cI didn\u2019t throw my toys out of the pram,\u201d said Wood, who has won 42 caps and captained England against Argentina in 2013. \u201cThe reality was I wasn\u2019t picked because what he had seen from me hadn\u2019t been good enough at that stage. \u201cA lot was made about that at the time but I was never having a tantrum. I was simply stating that what he had seen from me was average, it wasn\u2019t good enough and that if I wanted to get in the England team I had to improve. Eddie is very straight-talking. He says it how it is at the time and then moves on pretty quickly. He has been all smiles since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d With a fitness doubt still hanging over Courtney Lawes and with Maro Itoje, James Haskell and Jack Clifford also sidelined, it is more than possible Jones will be tempted by Wood\u2019s lineout expertise when he finalises his matchday 23 to play the Springboks on Saturday week. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t fulfil a role in the back row, whatever it is,\u201d added Wood. \u201cIt might be off the bench. I have to get in the squad first but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be ready if required. I knew it may take an injury or 10 to get me here but that\u2019s the nature of the game.\u201d He is also looking forward to working with England\u2019s forwards coach, Steve Borthwick, for the first time and would love to re-establish himself as a permanent member of England\u2019s back row. \u201cThe door is ajar for me. I\u2019ve got one foot through it but now I have to show what I am about in training. Hopefully I can do myself justice and we\u2019ll see where it goes from there. \u201cI want to get better as a player and that is one of the things Eddie Jones is massive on: having a growth mentality and improving day to day. I\u2019ve never for one second thought I was the finished article. \u201cI\u2019ll always wish things had been different at that World Cup and that we were more successful but that\u2019s true of every game I lose. If and when I eventually finish with England it would be nice to finish on a high.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
