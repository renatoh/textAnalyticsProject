Pep Guardiola had suggested there would be few additions, so the change in stance may be owing to a potential transfer ban by Fifa for alleged rule breaches regarding the signing of overseas youngsters. Mendy cost \u00a352m, then a world record for a defender, from Monaco in summer 2017. The 24-year-old was ruled out for most of last season because of a serious knee injury and suffered another knee problem in November. He made a single appearance in January before a relapse. Mendy was a substitute for Wednesday\u2019s 1-0 home win over West Ham but Guardiola said the player could not have been used and is unavailable for Saturday\u2019s trip to Bournemouth. There is a question mark against Mendy\u2019s ability to withstand the rigours of the Premier League but Guardiola said: \u201cIt\u2019s not about English football, it\u2019s the fact he\u2019s not able to play. He\u2019s injured during two seasons. If it happens in two seasons it can happen [in a third]. Hopefully not. We\u2019ll work with that, he\u2019s working with that, but the truth is we could use him only in a few games. At the end the strongest guys every day are there. That\u2019s why we are looking for, maybe for the next season. \u201cThere are three or four positions to look for, some ideas we have but it\u2019s an option to buy one [left-back] as well as a holding midfielder. I\u2019m not going to tell you which [other] position or players.\u201d Ilkay G\u00fcndogan\u2019s contract expires in summer 2020 and the midfielder has yet to agree a new one. \u201cIf he was 100% it would have been done. We are still in negotiations,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cBut if he doesn\u2019t want to, we cannot do anything else.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
