A letter in the FT regarding the non-activities of the UK in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and signed by the foreign secretary, David Miliband, is a masterpiece of dissembling ambivalence. An FT editorial the previous day had pointed out that \"Britain has actively discouraged any EU intervention\" in the DRC. Miliband not only attempts to deflect this criticism, but shifts the argument to process: \"We are not blocking action; we are instead arguing for coherent international military presences in DR Congo.\" And just in case such coherence can be found, the wizards of Whitehall explain that it cannot be used: the UN and EU representatives on the ground have \"agreed that the political process is gaining ground, and that a separate EU force is not the right option now.\" This is complete nonsense. It is also hypocritical to suggest that in the face of endless horrific death, rape, looting and displacement \u2013 estimates suggest up to 45,000 people a month are dying in DRC \u2013 the UK is apparently leading the way in streamlining international efforts. It is, at best, \"doing something\", in the vaguest sense of the word: flying around and negotiating in the safety of New York and Brussels. Mind you, perhaps this is an improvement: the UK did nothing as Rwanda was descending into massacre. To be fair, the problem is not the UK's alone, but it is in a worse position in this particular crisis than its fellow western handwringers. For the issue at stake is specific: the dispatch of an EU bridging force to the DCR, to back up the beleaguered UN mission Monuc and the hopeless government forces, and to fight off the renegade forces of Laurent Nkunda in the east of the country. If such a force were to be found, it should come from the states on current EU battlegroup rotation. This means either Germany with an operational HQ (OHQ) from France \u2013 but the Germans are also hesitant, while no one wants the French to go for political reasons \u2013 or primarily from the UK, which is slated (pdf: page 88) to provide both 1,500 troops and an OHQ on standby to be sent off at short notice. Instead, according to Miliband, they are offering a senior officer \u2013 to the UN. The UN does not want UK help: it wants the EU to send a force to the DRC. In fact, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, a man not known for being too proactive, sent a letter to the EU specifically asking for this help since his own organisation is not currently capable of deploying the necessary force, especially not of the type needed: professional crack fighters, capable of taking on very nasty people. The UK military is very good at that, as its foray into Sierra Leone some years ago showed; so is France, which did much the same in another part of DRC some years ago with Operation Artemis. Ban Ki-moon is probably not fussy: he will take any EU force. And he may have been prompted into asking for one by the words of Geoff Hoon, the former UK defence secretary, upon the creation of the EU concept: \"Battlegroups have been designed specifically, but not exclusively, to be used in response to a request from the United Nations to undertake rapid intervention in a hostile environment. This might include acting to prevent atrocities or helping with the provision of urgent humanitarian aid. This type of scenario is particularly applicable in failing or failed states.\" The deep irony is that the UK fought nearly every other member state in the EU to create the battlegroup system, but it does not have any troops to send. They are all in Afghanistan and Iraq. Other EU states, aware of this difficulty, have offered to send troops and merely asked the UK for help: Belgium, the former colonial ruler in the then Congo, would send whatever it has, but as a small military it has limited capabilities and has asked the UK to provide the OHQ; and apparently Sweden has also offered to help. In response, Miliband suggests that any \"EU member state is at liberty to offer contributions to Monuc\". That is passing the buck. There is a harsh reality in the DRC, one of death and horror: approximately five million people are thought to have died there over the past decade, and the killing goes on daily. Reverting to process as a mode of dealing with it is not only unacceptable, it is downright misleading: either we mean what we say about humanitarian interventions being in the cause of human rights for all, everywhere, or else we only mean it where we have a vested interest. There can be no doubt that when it comes to Africa, the latter applies \u2013 and it may be time to just admit it, rather than constantly ratcheting up the rhetoric and the moral ante by piling on declarations about genocide and creating meaningless new concepts such as the Responsibility to Protect (R2P)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
