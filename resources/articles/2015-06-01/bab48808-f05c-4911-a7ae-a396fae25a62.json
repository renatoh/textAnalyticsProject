But these days, at least, Weller is nowhere near as musically conservative as some of his fans. The hits understandably get the biggest response \u2013 Changing Man, You Do Something To Me, That\u2019s Entertainment, a slightly trudgy version of Start!, a sparkier take on A Town Called Malice that concludes the set \u2013 but the most intriguing stuff he plays is off his most recent album, Saturn\u2019s Pattern: if it\u2019s less fragmented and strange than its predecessor, Sonik Kicks, there\u2019s still something exploratory and off-kilter about the piano-powered title track, and the dense, ominous psychedelia of opener White Sky. The Who, claims Pete Townshend \u2013 even more gruffly than Paul Weller \u2013 have an easy job: \u201cWe\u2019 ave to send you \u2019ome \u2019appy.\u201d They do this by rolling out the hits in quick succession: Who Are You, the Seeker, Pictures of Lily, Behind Blue Eyes. My Generation now comes with an odd, slow little coda in place of the old explosive, Keith Moon-fuelled ending that\u2019s presumably there to circumvent the inevitable question of what a 71-year-old man is doing singing the line about hoping he dies before he gets old: \u201cMy generation, we\u2019re still here today.\u201d From a projection at the back of the stage, the young Moon stares down, doe-eyed. Daltrey can still swing a microphone around with considerable panache, but his voice is rougher than it was. Even so, it still has a powerful belligerence about it that matches the sound of Townshend\u2019s guitar and brings out the distrust and paranoia at the heart of I Can See for Miles. The guitarist seems a bit underwhelmed by the set. \u201cIt could have been better,\u201d he says, before a version of Won\u2019t Get Fooled Again that sounds great. The band didn\u2019t get to soundcheck, he complains, although frankly no one would have known if he hadn\u2019t mentioned it. And then he raises an amused eyebrow at Kanye West\u2019s line about being the greatest rock star on the planet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
