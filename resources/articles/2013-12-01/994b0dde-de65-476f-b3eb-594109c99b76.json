Technology affects all our lives, and can be both disruptive and liberating. The projects we are supporting demonstrate how simple, positive technological interventions can create momentous, positive change. This Christmas we focus on three inspiring charities which use low-cost technology in exciting and often ingenious ways. \"Technology justice\" is the aim of Practical Action. It promotes new technology, from MP3s to fireless cookers, as a way of tackling poverty. Its programmes include the provision of renewable, locally sourced sustainable energy, development of sustainable techniques to improve agriculture, and access to drinking water and sanitation, particularly in urban centres. Literacy is a crucial step in the eradication of poverty, and e-readers and mobile phone apps are the tool of choice of Worldreader, a global non-profit group. It uses them to distribute books and boost literacy in primary schools in some of the world's poorest countries. Half of sub-Saharan African schools have no or few books: Worldreader has distributed 721,000 e-books to more than 12,300 children in nine countries. Its results are encouraging. Less than five months after receiving one of its e-readers, children read more and read better. SolarAid literally wants to light up Africa. Around 598 million Africans have no access to electricity, and many are reliant on kerosene lamps, which emit noxious smoke. The charity provides access to clean, affordable solar lights in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia. Its solar lamps, which cost as little as $10, are healthier, greener and cheap to run. As part of this year's Christmas appeal, we are also going back to Katine, a rural sub-county in north-east Uganda, which the Guardian has been supporting since 2007. Thanks to readers' generosity in past Christmas appeals, the lives of Katine's 30,000 residents have improved significantly. But life still remains fragile for this farming community. It is subject to increasingly erratic weather patterns that can destroy harvests and leave farmers to struggle, and residents have little in the way of extra assets to see them through difficult times. We're working with Farm Africa, an NGO that has supported more than a million farmers across east Africa this year to improve Katine residents' access to capital and help develop their livelihoods, and take control of their futures. We will also support Farm Africa's work in Tigray in Ethiopia. All donations to Farm Africa's Katine project will be matched by the UK government. Last year Guardian readers' generosity raised more than \u00a3290,000 for eight Christmas appeal charities which help disabled people participate fully in society. Thank you: your donations made a real difference to the lives of thousands of people. Over the next few weeks we will demonstrate in a series of articles, films and photo galleries how our Future Africa charities transform lives. We hope they inspire you to give generously."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
