That final against Roger Federer had been a match too far, one by his own admission he was always second best, having spent the best part of his energy defeating Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals. Now, with the Spaniard having dramatically pulled out of Wimbledon on Friday evening, Murray may in all probability find himself playing Federer again a fortnight today. \"I feel I am ready to win a slam now,\" said Murray yesterday,\" but I understand how difficult it is.\" John McEnroe was quick to concur. \"To pretend there isn't going to be a tremendous amount of pressure on Andy is disingenuous,\" said the American. \"He seems in a pretty good state and we will see how much he believes in himself when he hits a couple of rough patches. Tim Henman was the talk of the town and he should have been in the final the year he played Goran Ivanisevic. Tim maximised his ability, but Murray is one of the most talented guys you are going to see on a tennis court. He's better equipped and believes deep down, more than Henman, that he can win it.\" McEnroe, three times Wimbledon champion and twice runner-up between 1980 and 84, and once again working for BBC television, remains a huge fan of Murray. \"He reminds me of myself. He has a natural feel for the ball. I like his movement and the extra bounce he has developed and the pop on his serve. I would be surprised if he doesn't win a couple of majors or more.\" In Nadal's enforced absence, Federer will open play tomorrow on Centre Court, with or without its roof, against Le Yen-hsun of Tapei, which means Murray will play his first-round match against Robert Kendrick on Tuesday. Inevitably, Federer was asked if he now regarded Murray as his principal threat. \"There are many guys around who are dangerous. Maybe it's hard for them to win the tournament but on any given days they can create a huge upset.\" If this was something of a back-handed compliment then Federer, having lost his past four matches against Murray since the US Open, was certainly not about to sing his praises, for there is no doubt Murray has wormed his way into Federer's head. \"Andy has a wonderful feel. He's a great tactician. He has finally proved it because it took him some time, longer than I expected. That was the disappointing part.\" Disappointing to whom? Certainly not to Murray who has always been remarkably clear-headed about his progress, taking it step by step. It took Federer until his 17th slam to win his first at Wimbledon in 2003; this will be Murray's 15th. As Peter Lundgren, Federer's former coach, pointed out: \"Roger was not ready physically or mentally to win a slam before he won Wimbledon.\" The same applied to Murray. Now the Scot believes his moment is close. Certainly, at 22, he has just entered the optimum time for delivering his best; Federer, who will be 28 in August, is slipping beyond that period of maximum opportunity. Not that you might think so, the Swiss having just won his first French Open and 14th record-equalling slam. But then there are always exceptions. \"I believe I can win. I felt like I could win the tournament last year, but I just wasn't ready. Now my game's there,\" said Murray. \"It's a matter of putting it all together. I know what it takes to win a slam after getting to the final of the US Open. Maybe subconsciously when I got to that final I knew that physically I had what it takes to play seven matches. I'm stronger now than I was then.\" Of course, with Nadal's absence the dynamic has shifted. As Serena Williams said: \"I'm sure there are a lot of guys on the men's tour who are probably celebrating and partying.\" It is tempting to suppose Federer found Nadal's withdrawal like his birthday and Christmas rolled into one. The four slam finals he has lost out of the 18 played have all been against the Spaniard. As for the new Queen's champion, the sudden disappearance of the world No1 from his side of the draw might be a little unsettling, given that he is now the top seed, and expectations have grown accordingly (if that is possible in the Brit- fevered atmosphere of Wimbledon). So Murray will continue to mumble the mantra of \"one match at a time\". He did not hit at all on Friday, playing some golf and going go-karting \u2013 \"no crashes, just winning\". He trained hard Tuesday to Thursday and then practised twice yesterday. And so the moment has all but arrived. \"It's easy to say 'Oh, Rafa's not playing so Andy's got a much easier route to the final',\" said Murray. \"I don't view it like that at all. I feel I have a chance but I'll have to play great to do it.\" Wimbledon expects. As usual."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
