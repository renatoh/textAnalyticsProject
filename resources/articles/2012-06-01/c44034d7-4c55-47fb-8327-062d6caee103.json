Plonked me in front of the telly, just so I could bore my grandchildren about it one day. (My grandchildren who'll probably be living on the moon.) I don't remember anything about it. But I'm glad they got me up. I thought I'd give my own son something momentous not to remember. Took him down to the Thames on Sunday, so he could tell his grandchildren (who'll probably live on Venus) that he saw the diamond jubilee of Elizabeth II, back in the day when there was a monarchy, before the revolution ... Pah! What a bloody waste of time that was. We stood in a miserable crowd several streets away from the river, in the rain, being turned back by policemen and security guards wherever we tried to go. Then we went home, crying. I'm now going to make every effort to insure his first word is \"republicanism\". Still, I feel I let him down, on the bore-the-grandchildren experience front. But wait, what's this \u2013 The Transit of Venus: a Horizon Special (BBC2). On the morning of 6 June, a very rare planetary alignment \u2013 far less frequent than any jubilee \u2013 will take place: Venus will pass across the face of the sun. And here's Liz Bonnin to tell us all about it. Hang on, Liz Bonnin, the biologist? What's she doing fronting a programme about astronomy? Oh yes, that's what she's doing, I remember \u2013 Liz pretty much is Venus, an absolute goddess. Totally brainy too, of course, even if this is not exactly the right field for her. And she's got Dr Lucie Green, the solar physicist, to help with the planetary stuff. And Dr Helen Czerski, the, er, oceanographer \u2026 Oh, I see. Venus did once have oceans, before they were whipped away by epic solar winds. And there was me \u2013 call me Sid the Sexist \u2013 thinking they just got three beautiful brainy women in because it fits with the Venus theme, even if it's not quite their subject. When actually they got them in because they're the best men for the job, so to speak. There are more of them too, women everywhere. Here's Sue Smrekar, a vulcanologist, up an mountain; and Birgit Sattler, another biologist, up another mountain; and \u2026 oh, Seth Shostak, something to do with telescopes, who's very clearly a he. Mark Swain and David Ehrenreich too, unquestionably blokes. Boo, hiss, get 'em off ('em meaning the blokes, just to be quite clear). It was going so well until then. Anyway, it's very nice \u2013 refreshing even \u2013 to have science presented by women. What, that's sexist too? It's probably sexist to even notice they were women. I did though, and I like it ... and I had better drop this before it goes to tribunal. More to the point, it isn't just fascinating, it's important too. A previous one of these transits led \u2013 via Captain Cook and Tahiti \u2013 to the first calculation of the size of the solar system and the birth of modern astronomy. They help us better understand the secrets of the universe. And \u2013 most fascinating of all \u2013 they are helping us in our search for life elsewhere. That's what Seth, the telescope man (not that his gender matters), is doing \u2013 they're listening telescopes, and Seth is listening for life ... elsewhere. Whoa. Turns out my great grandchildren won't be living on Venus after all. Way too hot and hostile, ever since the oceans got torn off. They may be living somewhere else though, somewhere more like here. Or perhaps someone else will be living here (if this planet isn't too hot and hostile by then). ET in other words, which is about a billion times more interesting than ER. Screw the Queen, this week is all about the transit of Venus. I'll get my son up for that. What, it's on at 4.46 in the morning? No, problem, we're normally up then anyway. Oh, the forecast is for clouds. Never mind, there's another in 2117. By which time he'll probably be approaching retirement, wherever he is in the solar system. Also lovely is All in The Best Possible Taste (Channel 4), Grayson Perry's fearless and sneerless study of class and taste. We'll deal with it properly next week, when he's in Tunbridge Wells to meet the middle classes. Should be even more fun that the working classes of Sunderland.
