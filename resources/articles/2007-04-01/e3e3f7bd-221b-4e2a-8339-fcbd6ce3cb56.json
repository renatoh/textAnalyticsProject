You're not alone - but there is a bona fide Da Vinci code that you and the kids can decipher. The all-round genius habitually wrote personal notes in right-to-left \"mirror writing\", possibly to hide his thoughts from the Catholic church or, more likely, it was because, being left-handed, ink would easily smudge if he wrote normally. Apparently, only one in 6,500 people can write backwards naturally due to an \"atypical language centre\" in the brain ... but there are ways to master it. One option is to hold a pen in each hand, writing with your preferred side, while imitating the movement with the other - but that's probably best suited for ambidextrous sorts (and who wouldn't give their right arm to be ambidextrous?). Another is to hold paper to your chest or forehead while standing in front of a mirror - now write in a way that is legible as you see it. Easiest of all, however, is to write normally on near-transparent paper, flip it over, and trace the text - voila! Ten Drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, National Museum Wales, until June 3. museumwales.ac.uk Recreate the cinema at home Abigail Flanagan Forget family bonding over a jug of gravy, as the advert suggests. Nope, down our way, family night means cinema night. The inspired creation of my son's mate, Louis - who comes from a long line of thespians who don't do anything by halves - cinema night turns your average DVD rental into a full-on \"experience\". First off, select your film. Ideally this should involve an element of (possibly heated) family debate, but don't overlook films from your own childhood: the likes of Bugsy Malone and the original Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory take on a new light viewed as a parent and make fantastic film-night fodder. (Do resist the temptation to sing along. Aside from embarrassing your children, anyone creating a disturbance may be ejected by the management.) This being a cinema, you're going to need tickets - so get your enterprising offspring to make and then sell these to you in return for their pocket money - and \"favourite food\" snacks. Oh the joy at not being fleeced into paying a tenner for two Fruit Shoots and a bucket of stale, germ-ridden popcorn (have you seen how kids help themselves to the stuff at the local multi-screen?). Instead try Popz Microwave Popcorn: at around \u00a31.79 for a three-pack, you won't mind so much when they spill the lot on the floor. Cinema night's also a great incentive for good behaviour. So dust down those star charts and pit your kids against each other. The one with the most stars at the end of the week gets to choose the film, second place the snacks and so on. This is somewhat harder if you've only got one child as you have to throw your own hat into the ring. But if I'm really polite and don't shout too much this week I think I stand a good chance of winning. Finally, having checked that everyone's been to the loo, it's time for the film to begin. At this point you must, quite literally, turn off the house lights, before giving up your tickets and being ushered to your seat by kids armed with torches. Now sshhh, cuddle up and enjoy the film. Oh, and don't forget to turn off your mobile. Rummage through a scrapstore Melissa Viguier A scrapstore is the perfect place to go with your kids, because they are brilliant recycling projects that produce masses of cheap craft materials (a carrier bag full for a \u00a31). Nearly everything you find was going to be thrown out by local businesses: this may sound a bit squalid, but the reality is clean and safe. You can rummage among the piles of wallpaper and fabric books, tubes, and bottle tops, sticky back plastic, cotton reels. Or you can revel in the bizarre highlights such as costumes, shop-window displays and foam mating. Every scrapstore reflects the local businesses, and there are now dozens of these craft emporiums around the country. Diverting materials from landfill, and providing affordable opportunities for everyone to realise their artistic potential! You can find out where your local scrapstore is by looking under craft materials in Yellow Pages, or just typing your location and \"scrapstore\" into a search engine. Hang out with Andy Warhol Dea Birkett My teenager presumes her mother was perfectly behaved at her age. However much I insinuate that we did things in the 70s even she might consider out-of-bounds, my 14-year-old declares I must have been Miss Pubescent Goody Two Shoes. As far as she's concerned, wickedness wasn't invented until 1992. It took the Wolverhampton Art Gallery to change her mind. In the new triangular Pop Art gallery, the worst of 60s and 70s behaviour is clearly on display: Hockney's naked men from Physique Pictorial; Hamilton's Swingeing London 67 poster, showing some Rolling Stones being arrested for drug possession; Warhol's portrait of Jackie Kennedy, demonstrating that violence didn't begin with the Iraq war. \"That all went on when you were a teenager?\" gasped my daughter. Instead of a website, the gallery's teenage supporters have a MySpace page, where they chat about Warhol and Blake as if they were the latest celebrities. There are even white leather sofas where parents and teenagers can hang out together, sharing sinful youthful secrets. So we did. Thank you, thank you, Andy Warhol. You made me look bad, and therefore good, in the eyes of my teenager.
