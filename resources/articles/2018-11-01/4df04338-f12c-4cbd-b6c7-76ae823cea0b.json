Running on a Motoring Enthusiast ticket, Muir was elected as a federal senator in 2013 before losing his seat three years later. He returned home to south-eastern Victoria to run his timber mill and raise his family. But the 37-year-old has switched to another minor party, the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers, and he\u2019s their candidate for the seat of Morwell, one of 11 hopefuls in perhaps the most unpredictable and intriguing contests on 24 November. Muir turned up at the pre-polling centre at Traralgon this week in dusty boots and dirt all over his jeans. He\u2019d been up early delivering cypress timber and was heading home to the mill, which is in Denison, just outside the electorate. It\u2019s a part-time campaign, because as a saw miller he has to make a living. His wife, Kerrie-Anne, is standing for the party in the upper house. \u201cI am managing both. It is hard, it is tiring, stressful and fun,\u201d he says. Muir surprised many in Canberra. After a shaky start, he wasn\u2019t the clich\u00e9d redneck bumpkin out of his depth, and there was nuance to his world view. In Morwell, he is campaigning on his support for the timber industry, especially his opposition to the proposed Great Forest national park, which he says would destroy the industry and hamper four-wheel drivers, campers and hunters doing their thing. Labor is under pressure from environmental groups and the Greens to establish the park by adding to existing protected areas in the state\u2019s Central Highlands. Muir says he\u2019s a \u201cuseless hunter\u201d, but he\u2019s a hunter, especially of feral animals, and he believes regulations are hampering the rights of law-abiding gun owners. In a campaign dominated by the power industry and whether brown coal underneath the Latrobe Valley should be left in the ground, Muir is no climate change denier. \u201cI was the person who saved Arena [Australian Renewable Energy Agency, the clean energy body]. If it wasn\u2019t for my vote, it was absolutely getting abolished. Same as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find no matter what the future is going to be outside of coal, that is going to be a change and I support that. I don\u2019t have a problem with that at all.\u201d When Muir\u2019s preferences were released, there were raised eyebrows. In a crowded race that everyone agrees will come down to voters\u2019 alternative choices, Muir put Labor\u2019s Mark Richards ahead of the conservative cluster \u2013 sitting member Russell Northe, the Nationals\u2019 Sheridan Bond and the Liberals\u2019 Dale Harriman. That was a boost for Labor and \u201cdisappointed\u201d Bond, but then there was a twist. The Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party has registered three how-to-vote cards with the Victorian Electoral Commission, and the other two cards put Northe and the conservative parties ahead of Richards. On Thursday, Muir was handing out the cards that favoured Richards and he says that\u2019s all he\u2019ll be distributing. Richards is a former Hazelwood power station worker whose priority is workers\u2019 jobs. \u201cAll polls at this stage are saying the ALP is going to hold government, so in my view if that\u2019s going to be the case, I don\u2019t want the left faction to take over,\u201d Muir says. \u201cI want factions in there who are going to try to stand up for regional communities and I think Mark is one of those people who would defend the timber industry.\u201d There is another wildcard in this seat. Northe was elected in 2006 as a National party MP. Last year, he resigned from the party, citing depression and gambling issues that had left him in serious debt. He\u2019s now an independent, and at the last minute decided to recontest a seat he holds by just 1.8%. Northe was once a local football star and, at 52, he\u2019s still got the build and the fitness. He strides around the pre-polling centre, thumping \u201cmates\u201d on the back. \u201cPeople have reached out to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI think there\u2019s some understanding that I\u2019m a real person. I\u2019ve lived in the community all my life, I\u2019m not sitting up on a pedestal [pretending] that we don\u2019t have difficulties or challenges in our life.\u201d The editor of Latrobe Valley Express, Jarrod Whittaker, says \u201ctrying to predict the outcome is fruitless\u201d in Morwell. The whispering suggests that it is between Richards and either Bond from the Nationals or Northe, who says it might take days of counting to sort things out. Muir says he misses politics. \u201cIt was incredibly eye-opening,\u201d he says, and \u201cthe fact that I wasn\u2019t rusted to either side meant I was able to call out either side for their bullshit and I did on a regular basis.\u201d He doesn\u2019t lack confidence but is realistic. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule anything out, but there\u2019s a very real chance come 25 November I\u2019ll still be milling timber.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
