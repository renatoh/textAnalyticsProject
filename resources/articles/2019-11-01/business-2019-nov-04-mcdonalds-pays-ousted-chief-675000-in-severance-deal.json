The relationship, about which little is known, contravened McDonald\u2019s company policy. The termination was categorized as \u201cwithout cause\u201d, the Chicago-based firm said, signaling that the transgression wasn\u2019t so severe as the prevent him from receiving exit payments. The company said on Monday its global chief people officer, David Fairhurst, would also leave but did not give any reasons. Easterbrook, 52, was born in Watford and joined McDonald\u2019s in 1993. He left in 2011 to become chief executive of Pizza Express and later Wagamama, before rejoining McDonald\u2019s in its head office in Illinois as global chief brand officer in 2013. He became chief executive two years later. He also has a seat on the board at Walmart. According to his LinkedIn profile, Fairhurst has been with McDonald\u2019s for nearly 15 years, holding key human resources positions. Like Easterbrook, he ascended to the upper reaches of McDonald\u2019s US operation via the UK office. The termination of the two executives speaks to increasing pressure on large corporations to act decisively in instances where executives\u2019 conduct threatens the reputation of the company. \u201cCEOs are the face of the company, and stake holders expect them to be aligned with its core values,\u201d noted Jordan Cohen, marketing officer at North 6th Agency. \u201cThis goes against the perception of the McDonald\u2019s brand identity and the company is going to need to navigate this carefully.\u201d The subsequent firing of the McDonald\u2019s head of HR, Cohen added, suggests a broader breakdown at executive levels of the company. \u201cThese types of scandals don\u2019t come out of nowhere so clearly there was a breakdown there. Someone was aware of the situation and did not act to address it, didn\u2019t surface it to the board, or was acting to protect the CEO and not the interests of the company.\u201d McDonald\u2019s response, Cohen added, \u201cshows the board took the misconduct seriously\u201d. News of Easterbrook\u2019s departure broke on Sunday afternoon in the US. At the close of trading yesterday, the company\u2019s shares had fallen by 2.7%. Given Easterbrook\u2019s 2018 base salary of $1.35m, his severance pay would amount to around $675,000. He received total compensation of $15.9m in 2018, according to a regulatory filing which showed he was also eligible for 18 months of health benefits. \u201cIn consideration for [severance] benefits, Mr Easterbrook has agreed to a release of claims in favour of the company,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in the regulatory filing. The new chief executive, Chris Kempczinski, would have an annual base salary of $1.25m, with a target-based bonus of 170% of his annual base salary, McDonald\u2019s said. Easterbrook\u2019s separation agreement contains a two-year post-termination non-competition clause, which is six months longer and more expansive in scope than his existing agreements. An exhaustive list of companies for which Easterbrook may not work in that period was included in the separation agreement. Burger King, Five Guys, Checker\u2019s, Tim Horton\u2019s, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Subway, Chick-fil-A, Chipotle and Domino\u2019s Pizza were among fast food companies named. The list also included coffee outlets Starbucks, Caffe Nero and Costa. Easterbrook\u2019s time at the top of McDonald\u2019s has featured a drive to use more technology in restaurants and to offer customers more fresh ingredients. The company has faced challenges negotiating with franchisees and a push by employees for union rights and protection against such issues as sexual harassment and discrimination. Jonathan Maze, the editor of Restaurant Business magazine, told the Washington Post that Easterbrook had been \u201cpretty consequential\u201d to the business. In a note quoted by the Wall Street Journal, analysts at investment bank Piper Jaffray &amp; Co advised investors to look to other fast food stocks, because \u201cchanges of this magnitude tend to be disruptive\u201d. In an email to McDonald\u2019s staff, the divorced father of three acknowledged the relationship, and said it was a mistake. \u201cGiven the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on,\u201d Easterbrook wrote. Desiree Moore, a Chicago-based lawyer acting as spokeswoman for Easterbrook, said he was \u201cdeeply grateful for his time at McDonald\u2019s\u201d and would not comment further."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
