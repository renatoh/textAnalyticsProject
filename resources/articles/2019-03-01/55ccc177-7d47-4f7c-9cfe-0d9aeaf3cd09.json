Members of the national squad will find themselves in direct confrontation over the next few weeks as Manchester City and Liverpool go head to head in the Premier League title race and City meet Tottenham in the Champions League quarter-finals. Club rivalries have spilled over into England get-togethers in the past, most notably between the contingents from Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United, with players reluctant to mix together. Those divisions have been cited by those involved as a contributing factor to the national team\u2019s failures at major tournaments. Yet, despite Kyle Walker taking to social media to revel in Harry Maguire\u2019s late equaliser against Liverpool in a league game in January, Kane believes the unity nurtured by Southgate will survive any tensions generated by the clubs\u2019 most fiercely contested run-in of recent years. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard about things happening in the past: people sitting on different tables and teams being divided,\u201d said the Spurs striker. \u201cYou just can\u2019t have that in a team. You need to be 100% together. \u201cThe great thing about this team is we have a bit of fun, a laugh and a joke, but we know when we are here it is all about England and we put the club stuff to one side. Even with the Liverpool and City boys it is 100% England. I\u2019m sure when we go back [to the clubs] there\u2019ll be plenty of text messages and group messages flying about. We have got a great bond here and at the end of the day we\u2019re all good friends whether we play for one club or another. We get on very well. When we are back at our clubs it is 100% about winning but we have that respect for each other so we can talk to each other and be friends. \u201cThat has been part of our success and it\u2019s kind of happened naturally. Everyone looks forward to coming away with England and meeting up again. Hendo [Jordan Henderson] has been getting on with Raheem [Sterling], and Walks [Kyle Walker] with Trent [Alexander-Arnold]. With Hendo and Raheem, for example, they\u2019ve known each other a long time. Of course they want to beat each other but they\u2019re not going to let that get in the way of what\u2019s important this week, which is the international game. I don\u2019t need to talk to them about that or anything. They do that naturally.\u201d Kane trained with the squad at St George\u2019s Park on Tuesday, with the uncapped Declan Rice and Callum Hudson-Odoi given their first run-out with the senior squad. Marcus Rashford sat out the session with a slight ankle problem, rendering him a doubt for Friday\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier against Czech Republic at a sold-out Wembley. The United forward has been troubled by the issue since the goalless draw with Liverpool almost a month ago. Jadon Sancho \u2013 who scored a Panenka against Jack Butland in the penalty shootout that concluded training \u2013 and Hudson-Odoi are potential replacements if he is not risked. The World Cup and Nations League semi-finalists go into their qualification campaign as favourites to progress from the group and with expectations raised. \u201cWe feel that: people now expecting us to do well where, before the World Cup, there was no expectation,\u201d Kane said. \u201cIt is great that we have turned that around. It is down to us as players to use that experience to manage expectations. We\u2019ve handled it really well since the World Cup; we\u2019re the only team who got into the semi-finals at the World Cup and through their Nations League group, and we probably had one of the hardest groups. \u201cThat was big for us, to prove to everyone that it wasn\u2019t just a one-off, that this team were really building for something special in the future. Everyone handles expectation differently. We still have players who are very young and inexperienced in this squad, so we have to manage them and make sure everyone\u2019s OK and comfortable with the situation. \u201cAs one of the experienced players in the squad, it\u2019s down to us to do that,\u201d Kane continued. \u201cAll we can do is play the way we have been playing, and play with that freedom. Our aim is to win the Nations League and we\u2019re more than capable of doing that if we fully focus.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
