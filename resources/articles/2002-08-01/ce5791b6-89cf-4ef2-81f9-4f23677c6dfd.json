Marcos would be following in the footsteps of Juninho and Gilberto Silva, who joined Middlesbrough and Arsenal respectively in the past week. \"I have been asked to sell him to an English club,\" said Rachel Anderson, his agent. \"It shouldn't be too difficult to sell one of the most successful goalkeepers in the world. \"I will be having talks with three Premiership clubs in the next few days. He is happy to go anywhere in England, not just London.\" Anderson, a Fifa agent, would not reveal which clubs she would approach, although Manchester City and Middlesbrough are thought to be in the frame. Claudio Guadagno, who represents Marcos in Brazil, said: \"He has three years left on his contract but Palmeiras are open to offers. England is where there is money in football at the moment - certainly better than Italy. \"Marcos wants to go to another country but the club will want a very good proposal before agreeing to let him go.\" Marcos was beaten for the first time in 353 minutes' play, stretching back to the World Cup quarter-final against England, when Palmeiras were knocked out of Brazil's Champions Cup last weekend. Known as Saint Marcos, he conceded only four goals during the World Cup finals, justifying the coach Luiz Felipe Scolari's decision to prefer him to Dida."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
