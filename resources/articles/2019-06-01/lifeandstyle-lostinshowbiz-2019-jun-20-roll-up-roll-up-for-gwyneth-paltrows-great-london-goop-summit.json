But next week promises to be a particularly special time for the UK, as madam\u2019s wellness summit comes to London. The event is called In Goop Health, but is specifically billed as a summit. Cost? \u00a31,000 for a day ticket, or \u00a34,500 for the weekend, which includes a two-night hotel stay. I don\u2019t think your wallet would ever have felt cleaner. Or, indeed, more rinsed. If I had to pick the summit the Goop summit seems most like, I would probably go for Munich 1938. One party \u2013 the customer \u2013 is going to come away imagining they\u2019ve got something worthwhile out of it, while the other party \u2013 a madly revanchist would-be empire \u2013 is going to be laughing all the way to the central bank. \u201cDid you have a good time, Neville?\u201d \u201cYes! I hold in my hand a \u00a327 Psychic Vampire Repellent. It says here that you simply \u2018spray around the aura to protect from psychic attack and emotional harm\u2019.\u201d There aren\u2019t a huge number of Nevilles at In Goop Health, of course, \u201cwellness\u201d being something that more easily parts women from their money. We know this because the event has recently been held in New York, giving us ready access to the weapons-grade bollocks that has already been written about it, and a guide to what to expect for any Londoner planning to attend. It is extremely hard to choose a favourite among these reports, but for me, the Teen Vogue one probably edges it. A kind of prose colonic, this science-free quasi-press release gives everything about the summit the slavish credence it doesn\u2019t deserve. Sample text includes: \u201cIt became clear that radical self-acceptance is a core tenet of Goop\u2019s evolving wellness code.\u201d Mmm. It\u2019s not that radical, is it, if you dropped at least a grand to be there, and someone\u2019s trying to flog you an ear-seeder while telling you it\u2019ll balance your nervous system? Speaking of which, one of the summit\u2019s events is a financial workshop described as \u201centering a realm of vulnerability\u201d. Well, quite. I hope nobody mentions the elephant in the room: namely, that everyone in it has parted with a grand or a lot more to submit to the \u201cultimate retail experience\u201d, where you can pick up something called sex dust within touching distance of a stall selling restored farm tables. A juxtaposition that reminds me of a Victoria Wood line: \u201cWhy, when you go into a department store, no matter which door you choose, is it always the leotard and handbag department? Why do they put them together? It\u2019s not like you\u2019ve ever bought a leotard and thought: \u2018Ooh, now I must get a handbag to go with it.\u2019\u201d RIP to a comic genius who made women feel a billion times better about their lives than \u2013 hang on, let me get my readers on \u2013 a 24-carat gold face-sculpting bar or 10-day extreme cleanse. Sorry, where were we? Ah yes. As far as that financial workshop goes, I imagine it takes a really long time to train as the sort of person who could hold such an important event at the Goop summit, but I kind of feel I could wing it with nothing but a raised eyebrow and the words: \u201cDuh, you need to stop spending money on THIS bullshit. Is your boss \u2013 probably a man \u2013 here this weekend? Is he twatting about with crystals and $300 hair oil and pretending he can feel the effects of a selenite wand being passed over his chakra? No? Then WAKE UP AND GET OUT OF HERE WHILE YOU STILL CAN. (Actually, just before you do, can you get me one of the overnight peels, because my friend says they\u2019re amazing? Pay you back.)\u201d As always, the villain of this piece is not the consumer, but rather the various entities preying upon them. I don\u2019t think we should have a lot of time for Gwyneth\u2019s on-site \u201cOptimism Doctor\u201d, who has actually trademarked this particular trade description. Ditto for the teacher offering an \u201cintuition workshop\u201d. Isn\u2019t the thing about intuition that you can\u2019t \u2026 but no. Which of us has the strength? And ditto-issimo for the Teen Vogue claim that \u201cseveral trends emerged throughout the day on what a post-mainstream wellness world might hold\u201d. I feel like it\u2019s reasonable to posit that Goop left the mainstream a few galaxies ago, maybe around the time of pushing a $46,000 mah jong set and solid-gold dumbbells ($125,000). Still, if you\u2019re planning to drop \u00a31,000 or even \u00a34,500 on attending next weekend \u2013 and I sense a lot of readers might be \u2013 I can only wish you well with all the wellness. And also warn you that all the drinks on offer sound like a come-and-get-us plea to the Bolsheviks. Would you like a glass of \u201cPi\u00f1a Chlor-adas infused with Elle Macpherson\u2019s WelleCo elixir\u201d? What about \u201cmatcha lattes dusted with Moon Juice and laced with collagen and pearl\u201d? If those don\u2019t tempt, then I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s only one smart decision: Goopglow. According to a report, Gwyneth\u2019s signature beverage Goopglow \u201ctastes like Kool-aid\u201d. Feels a little on the nose, but there you go. Now voyager: Geri hits the high seas with Richard Branson Fresh from the Spice Girls tour, this week found Geri Halliwell on the cruise ships. One cruise ship, to be precise \u2013 belonging to Richard Branson. The Scarlet Lady is part of Branson\u2019s new cruise ship line, Virgin Voyages, and Geri\u2019s job was to promote the new Mega RockStar Suites on board. \u201cVirgin Voyages\u2019 RockStar Suites are the perfect blend of luxury, glamour and a little bit of rock\u2019n\u2019roll opulence,\u201d Geri told reporters obligingly. \u201cExactly the way I like to enjoy my holidays.\u201d Yes, she likes to enjoy her holidays in the way of those words. But I think we can assume she won\u2019t be enjoying her holidays on this actual ship. As for Branson, he said: \u201cI just love the idea of RockStar Suites. They celebrate Virgin\u2019s musical heritage and how I got my start in the music industry.\u201d I wonder if there are nods to Richard\u2019s record company past in the bits of the NHS he runs \u2013 or in the expensive litigation he is given to dragging the health service through. Either way, good old Branson. Still there. Even if he is one of those guys of a certain age in public life whose reappearance in the 2019 news prompts you to wonder vaguely: \u201cWasn\u2019t there \u2026 a thing? About 18 months ago? I\u2019m sure there was, you know, a thing.\u201d Please don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve checked the archives and the official response to the thing was: \u201cRichard has no recollection of this matter. Neither do his family and friends who were with him at the time.\u201d So there you go. For so many of us, Richard will always be too big to fail, and we wish him bon voyage in this latest venture."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
