As World Cup fever grips the UK, the girls\u2019 enthusiasm for the training session is matched by their obvious adoration of their coach and referee, Jawahir Roble, known as JJ to her friends. The training is part of a nationwide initiative sponsored by the English Football Association and aimed to benefit more than 20,000 girls aged five to 11 across the country. The programme, which was launched by the FA in 2017, aims to double girls\u2019 participation in the sport by 2020. But it is Roble, a Somali refugee who used to play football against a backdrop of gunshots, who has truly broken through the barriers to reach this pitch. She is the first female Muslim referee in British football. With multiple awards, including the match official gong at the FA\u2019s 2017 respect awards, and recognition in the sports personality category at the Somali achievement awards, she starred in the launch campaign for the new Nike-designed kit for the England women\u2019s football team and now has her eyes set on refereeing the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup. \u201cThat is my next challenge, it would be a dream come true,\u201d she says. Born in Somalia, she fled the war there with her family when she was a child, reaching the UK aged 10. Her love for football began at home in Mogadishu when she played with kids from her neighbourhood even as intense fighting between rival clan militiamen was engulfing the city. \u201cWe would hear loud gunshots while playing in the courtyard and then run back to the house,\u201d she recalls. \u201cMum would always run looking for me and ask me to stay indoors, but we would immediately regroup after the gunshots stopped and resume playing.\u201d With no resources and lack of sports equipment, she used to improvise with anything she could find. \u201cWe had no proper football, we sometimes used potatoes as a football, we used to make balls from newspapers and worn-out clothes,\u201d she says. Coming to the UK meant an end to living in fear, but also had its own challenges. \u201cLanding at Heathrow was surreal, I remember how excited I was! We made it safely,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are many people who could not make it, so we were the lucky ones.\u201d At school, she saw \u201cproper and modern\u201d sports equipment for the first time. \u201cI was amazed, they had proper footballs, long socks, proper pitches,\u201c she says. Unable to speak English, she formed her own football team, making new friends as her passion for the game made it easier for her to grasp the language. \u201cI was crazy, I would play every day during break-time, lunchtime and even after school,\u201d she says. Roble went on went on to do a coaching course, earning FA qualifications and then taking a professional refereeing course with the Middlesex FA, quickly progressing from youth to adult games. As a practising Muslim, she has worn a hijab throughout her career. \u201cOnce I am in the pitch and I blow the whistle to start the game, I am not a refugee, my hijab does not matter, my gender or colour of my skin does not matter, I am a referee and I know how to do my job well, that is it,\u201d she says. \u201cI see it in their eyes, some of the players and fans too, the disbelief in their faces is clear,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t let that stop me from doing my work. Refereeing is a tough job, there is a lot of pressure, you have to be focused and make quick decisions, so I don\u2019t have time to think about what people think of me. \u201cWhen the game ends, they realise what I am capable of. Some would even come up to me to say thank you, they are like: \u2018She is the best referee we ever had.\u2019\u201d Roble has also become a role model for young girls in her community. The girls she trains at Stonebridge have someone who looks like them in the field and the support of their families and the wider Somali community. But her own parents were uneasy at first. \u201cI did not have such support from my parents in the beginning, they advised me to concentrate on my studies,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was not easy, but they have now accepted me and do support me because they believe in me.\u201d Her ambitions reach beyond 2023 \u2013 Roble wants to establish a training academy in her home country, and train the Somali women\u2019s national football team. \u201cI will definitely do that, I cannot wait when Somalia becomes peaceful,\u201d she says. In the meantime, she continues to inspire young girls: \u201cI want to make them big, we are just starting from scratch but their future is bright.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
