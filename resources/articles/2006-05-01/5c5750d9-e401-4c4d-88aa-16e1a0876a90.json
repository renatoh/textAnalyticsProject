It said the government miscalculated the cost of the deal in 2003, which increased the starting salary for a consultant by 36% from \u00a350,810 to \u00a369,298. As a result the NHS is paying about \u00a390m a year more than ministers expected, contributing to the service's financial deficit. The King's Fund said there was little evidence of improvements in services offered to patients from this extra spending. The report said implementation of the deal was rushed and managers received inadequate guidance from the government. Many seemed to view the new consultants' contract as a form-filling exercise instead of a mechanism to push through changes in working patterns. The fund also called on ministers to provide guidance on how managers could use incentives to encourage consultants to \"work smarter\", with a stronger link between pay and performance. Niall Dickson, its chief executive, said: \"The NHS finds itself under severe financial strain, there is an imperative to show patients are getting value for money from reforms in the health service.\" Paul Miller, chairman of the British Medical Association's consultants committee, said the report was based on a study of five hospitals only. Elsewhere the contract was delivering real benefits for patients by encouraging consultants to meet trusts' corporate objectives. The Department of Health said the contracts had \"already had a dramatic impact on the way in which managers and consultants work together to plan medical care\". Meanwhile, the shadow health minister, Andrew Lansley, accused ministers of creating instability and inefficiency in the NHS, during a debate in the Commons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
