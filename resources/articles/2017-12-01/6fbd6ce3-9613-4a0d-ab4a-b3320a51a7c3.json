MP Heidi Allen wiped away tears as Labour\u2019s Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions select committee, described persuading a man not to kill himself and spoke of another man who told him about his \u201clucky week\u201d going to a funeral \u201cso they could finish off the food\u201d. The debate came as the government pledged it will make universal credit reports from between 2012 and 2015 available to the select committee in a concession to Labour, but work and pensions secretary David Gauke said they should not be made public. Gauke said the government had nothing to hide on universal credit, hinting that the project assessment reports would not give any sort of damning indictment of the flagship welfare reform. Labour said the government had so far ignored a ruling in August by the information commissioner that five of the reports should be released to campaigners because their publication would be in the public interest. Government sources said they would continue to challenge their public release, even though the reports will be given to the committee, after Labour used an arcane parliamentary device called a \u201chumble address\u201d to the Queen, requesting ministers release project assessment reviews conducted into the welfare reform. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office has already said the papers should be published publicly and in full \u2013 as that is specifically in the public interest. During the debate, a visibly upset Allen said she was pleased how MPs were working cross-party to improve the system. \u201cI\u2019m humbled by the words from my honourable, good friend from Birkenhead [Field],\u201d she said. \u201cNo government is perfect, no benefits system is perfect, no debate, no motion is perfect, but by God we work together and make this better.\u201d Field intervened to give Allen a chance to compose herself, saying: \u201cI\u2019m just amazed for the first time I\u2019ve been able to report those events publicly without weeping. \u201cI\u2019m so affected by them, I\u2019m affected as she is. That\u2019s the debate we\u2019re really having \u2013 how do we represent here the desperateness of many of our constituents when many of us feel we can\u2019t offer them hope.\u201d Earlier Field said his constituents were being hit by the cumulative impact of reforms under Labour and Conservative governments. \u201cOn my last surgery Friday, for the first time ever a gentleman rose after we had spoken, I had tried to persuade him not to commit suicide, such was the desperateness that he saw the future for himself, and I realised the hand that shook my hand was wet. He\u2019d been crying. And the hand that shook my hand was the hand that wiped away those tears,\u201d he said. Gauke said he was granting the request on an \u201cexceptional basis\u201d and said the reports would only give a partial picture of the policy\u2019s impact, given how it had subsequently been revised. He said he would confidentially provide the reports to the select committee, and \u201chope and expect that the documents will not be disclosed further\u201d. Field hinted he was uneasy about the condition that his committee keep the reports confidential, and that he would seek guidance from Commons Speaker John Bercow about \u201cwhat sense of secrecy or of honour bind us\u201d when they get the documents. Labour and some Tory MPs have repeatedly voiced concern about the long wait faced by fresh claimants to be paid benefits once they apply for universal credit, originally six weeks but reduced to five in last month\u2019s budget. The Department for Work and Pensions has said no claimant needed to wait that long without funds, saying emergency payments to cover the period can be requested and received within three days and paid back over 12 months. Speaking in the debate, Gauke accused Labour politicians and the media of \u201cscaremongering\u201d, which he said was leading families to believe they had no way of accessing help. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Debbie Abrahams, said the reports would give a \u201cgreater insight into the scale of their implementation and design failures during the mismanagement of the programme and must be published unredacted and unedited\u201d.
