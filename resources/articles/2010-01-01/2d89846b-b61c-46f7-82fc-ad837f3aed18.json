Don't read on if you haven't seen episode three \u2026 Our heroes It pains me to say this, but after two amazing weeks, episode three is where difficult second album syndrome sets in. Being Human's charm is all about the cute domestic dramas. But having introduced the threats and the dark stuff so early on, George and Annie's jolly matchmaking exploits to get Hugh and Kirsty back together create a jarring shift in tone. Annie is cool with her invisibility remarkably quickly, and with Nina gone, George seems to swing from depressed to dealing-with-it to depressed again as the story demands. Meanwhile, Mitchell's vampire story simply drags. Getting to his anointing as vampire king involves endless scenes in abandoned parts of town with characters we don't care about, meaning most of the episode feels like Spooks, which doesn't really suit it. And seriously, is every public servant in the whole of Avon and Somerset now a corrupt vampire enabler? The disastrous date with Lucy puts another downer on a tender little strand, but as we all predicted\u2026 Our villains Lucy is Professor Jagget! I knew it! (Well actually, I did know it, I went on set and saw her). But the relative absence of Kemp and his mob for most of the episode was clearly building up to some sort of reveal \u2013 they've been skulking about in the shadows for three weeks now. Lucy's final line about God loving Nina was revealing: she's apparently united the conflicting human dialogues of faith and reason. Together that makes for powerful, and, so it follows, dangerous force. And the fact that she clearly knows about the people in the hospital enabling the vampire slaughter suggests we might have to tear these hero/villain categories up in a week or two. Yes, we know from the \"next week\" trail that she's going to try to kill Nina, but I'm a bit in love with her now so I have to cling on to hope. Absent friends The other thing that was wrong with this episode: precious little Nina and no Ivan. Address this soon, please. Hugh and Kirsty Hugh should of course really be with Annie, however that might be possible. But amid the gloom, it was nice to see a happy ending of sorts for the florist who likes German expressionist film and the \"irony\" of kebabs; and the barman who used to make plasticine models of Tessa Sanderson and Fatima Whitbread and make them fight. Mythbusting Vampires in Being Human can do without blood if they try hard enough. They travel in packs \u2013 Mitchell simply tells Cara to gather everyone up, and there \"everyone\" is. All it takes for them to accept Mitchell as King is an act of prowess in \"executing\" Cara for going against him in killing those girls. (Although Daisy wasn't quite so rapturous now, was she?) His challenge now is to get them clean and keep them that way. It's looking like Bristol is a global vampire hive \u2013 unless we're expected to believe that these dramas play out in every city in the world? Best scene Mitchell and Daisy's stand-off at the vampires' Emergency General Meeting really foregrounds his impossible situation. Daisy poses a delicious moral dilemma. Mitchell can either abet the killing of humans or insist his own kind do the improbable in changing their nature. The alternative? The mass genocide of both, we reckon. Best line Lucy (cheerily): \"Gotta go, have an anal abscess bursting in geriatrics!\" Who said Nurse Jackie got all the best lines? Cast 'n' crew Talking about Mitchell's story arc this season, Aidan Turner told me: \"All the characters this year have a massive journey. Mitchell's is pretty extensive; he goes all over the place. He is left in this weird hiatus where the leader of the vampires has been killed because of these guys and so now he has to make amends for that. It could go anywhere. It leaves the characters in that moment where no one knows what's going to happen so it could lead to anything.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
