Only the Russian Nikolai Valuev has ever weighed more for a world heavyweight title fight \u2013 and he was seven feet tall. But Joshua, who strolled to the scales looking relaxed with headphones on and chewing gum, said he is at no risk of becoming complacent despite his opponent looking out of shape. \u201cI feel good,\u201d he said. \u201cThe weigh-in is important but for heavyweights it doesn\u2019t really matter. It\u2019s about the skills that pay the bills and that leads to victory, it\u2019s not so much about the weight.\u201d When asked whether his opponent was too heavy, Joshua shook his head. \u201cNot really, he\u2019s a big lad. They should make a super-heavyweight division because there is that much of a vast difference. The art of the game is to hit and not get hit, avoid them punches. Imagine how being three stone heavier and everyone saying how fast he is, I\u2019ll definitely be beating him to the punch.\u201d The 30-year-old Briton will earn around \u00a360m for the controversial rematch in Saudi Arabia, compared to around \u00a313m for his opponent. However Joshua\u2019s promoter Eddie Hearn insisted money was secondary to reclaiming his belts. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he has wanted it so bad before,\u201d said Hearn. \u201cWhen he lost he wasn\u2019t in a great place for weeks after. But he\u2019s really got his head screwed on. It\u2019s \u2018I\u2019ve got to win this fight\u2019 not just \u2018It\u2019s a lot of money and I\u2019ve got to take it\u2019.\u201d Hearn also warned it would be wrong to assume Joshua had lost weight to keep the fight at a distance. \u201cHe feels amazing, he is punching faster and sharper than he has ever done before,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no intention to box for 12 rounds. He will box Ruiz and be smart, but he also wants to punish him and hurt him when he gets the opportunity to do so. You are going to see a vicious performance.\u201d The promoter again defended the decision to take the fight to Saudi Arabia, despite growing criticism from human rights organisations including Amnesty International. \u201cIt has just been the most amazing experience I have ever been involved with,\u201d Hearn told the Guardian. \u201cPeople say, what does Saudi know about boxing? They have TVs. They have the internet. They watch sport. And they are very tech-savvy and young.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
