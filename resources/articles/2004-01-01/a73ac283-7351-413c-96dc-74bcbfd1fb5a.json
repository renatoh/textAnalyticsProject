Mohamed Al Fayed, the club chairman, is unhappy with aspects of the \u00a37m fee due to Juventus for Edwin van der Sar and is refusing to pay the remaining \u00a32m instalment. Fifa, the game's world ruling body, has ordered Fulham to stump up but the club have refused and have been ordered to attend an appeal hearing on February 29 in London. Juve have reportedly threatened to recall Van der Sar to Turin. The case has direct parallels to the Steve Marlet affair, in which Al Fayed's anger over the \u00a311.5m fee and the role of agents in the transfer from Lyon led to his refusal to pay the last \u00a33.2m due on the deal, before the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland ordered the club to comply. The defender Michael Gray has joined Blackburn Rovers from First Division Sunderland on a 2-year contract. The 29-year-old had spent 11 years at Sunderland and was their longest-serving player. He was also one of the club's highest earners and had a spell on loan at Celtic this season. Blackburn will not pursue their interest in the Everton striker Tomasz Radzinski after being told he is not for sale."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
