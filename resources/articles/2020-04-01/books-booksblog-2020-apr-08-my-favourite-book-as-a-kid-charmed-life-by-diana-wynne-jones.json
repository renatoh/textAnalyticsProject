It was, so then I read it to them. Both times it was equally delightful, and I\u2019m lining it up for a third go now, because I can\u2019t think of anything that would cheer me up more. Published in 1977, Charmed Life is the first of Wynne Jones\u2019s books about a mysterious, brilliant enchanter known as Chrestomanci, all of which are excellent and unrivalled. This one, about Cat and Gwendolen Chant, two children who are sent to live with the great enchanter after their parents die, won her the Guardian children\u2019s fiction prize. Amid a glorious list of former winners (Goodnight Mr Tom! The Owl Service! The Knife of Never Letting Go!), it\u2019s probably my favourite. Cat, whose real name is Eric, is small, rather cowed, and not particularly good at anything other than being friendly. Gwendolen, his big sister, is very pretty and has a \u201creal talent for magic, dearie\u201d, as Mrs Sharp, the somewhat shifty witch who takes the orphans in, puts it. She\u2019s not very nice to her little brother (who \u201cwould have liked to have had just a little of Gwendolen\u2019s talent\u201d) and has grandiose plans to rule the world, which start with leaving Mrs Sharp behind, and being taken in by Chrestomanci. When the enchanter doesn\u2019t appreciate her talents, Gwendolen becomes increasingly furious, setting in progress a chain of events culminating in a fearsome battle in the castle\u2019s gardens. Long before Potter, I found joy in the orphan-discovering-they-have-magical-powers trope \u2013 and what a moment it is when these powers are finally realised in Charmed Life. There are laugh-out-loud scenes, such as when Gwendolen takes on Chrestomanci\u2019s apparently mild children, Julia and Roger, with a flying slice of bread and marmalade and Julia responds with a levitating jug of cocoa. And the magic Wynne Jones describes is just so fun; imagine using magic to animate your toy soldiers and set them against each other \u2013 although Julia\u2019s soldiers always run away. (\u201c\u2018Because that\u2019s just what I would do,\u2019 Julia said, putting out a knitting needle to mark her place in her book. \u2018I can\u2019t think why all soldiers don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d) Rereading it, I\u2019m delighted by all these moments yet again, but also chortling with pleasure at the inimitable virtuosity of Wynne Jones\u2019s writing, the delicate, understated humour of it all. The way with just a word, she tells us exactly who Gwendolen is. \u201cWe are the young Chants,\u201d she tells a station porter \u201cmagnificently\u201d. She stares \u201cvengefully\u201d after Chrestomanci. Or: \u201cShe had her usual glowing, exultant look, but she was looking secretive and important too.\u201d And Chrestomanci is just so gloriously vague, often dressed in an impossibly elegant silk dressing gown and looking \u201clike the Emperor of Peru\u201d, always arriving at just the right moment with an arched eyebrow. More than once, my children looked at me perplexed as I shuddered helplessly in mirth at exchanges like: \u2018Someone\u2019s been opening my letters,\u2019 said Gwendolen. \u2018And I don\u2019t care who it is, but I\u2019m not having it! Do you hear?\u2019 Cat gasped at the way she spoke. Chrestomanci seemed perplexed. \u2018How are you not having it?\u2019 he said. \u2018I won\u2019t put up with it!\u2019 Gwendolen shouted at him. \u2018In future, my letters are going to come to me closed!\u2019 \u2018You mean you want me to steam them open and stick them down afterwards?\u2019 Chrestomanci asked doubtfully. \u2018It\u2019s more trouble, but I\u2019ll do that if it makes you happier.\u2019 The book is in front of me right now ready to be reread, and once I\u2019m done I\u2019m heading off into the world of The Lives of Christopher Chant and Witch Week for some more Chrestomanci. Then, perhaps, Fire and Hemlock for mystery and romance, or The Time of the Ghost for some proper chills. Diana Wynne Jones: always and forever, my favourite."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
