Saints have finished on top of the table in each of the four seasons since Daniel Anderson succeeded Ian Millward as coach but Saturday's second consecutive Grand Final defeat by Leeds, who had collected one point fewer from 27 league fixtures, means they have been crowned champions only once during that time. In 2005 their hopes effectively disappeared with injuries to Sean Long and Lee Gilmour in a derby at Wigan which left the team so depleted they failed even to reach Old Trafford. They bounced back the following year to complete a rare double of Challenge Cup and Super League, beating Hull in the qualifying semi-final and again in the Grand Final. But in the past two years their consistency throughout the season has been negated by a Leeds team with a greater ability to peak on the big occasion. That is hard to stomach, given Saints' proud record of winning the title on each of their first four appearances in the Grand Final, between 1999 and 2006. Anderson's surprise and frustration at the latest below-par performance was graphically illustrated by the cameras that Sky is allowed to place in the Old Trafford dressing rooms. They captured the sort of half-time hairdryer blast which Sir Alex Ferguson has trademarked behind the closed doors of the Premier League. \"He did let us have it a bit,\" said Gilmour. \"But it was deserved. When we played with shape and field position we looked in control of the game but then we would go to sleep for 10 or 15 minutes, and you can't do that in a big game. We've trained hard all year for this and fallen at the last hurdle again. It's devastating.\" Anderson, who has earned a reputation as a softly spoken gentleman in his years at St Helens, had recovered his poise sufficiently after the game to make eloquent jokes about his half-time team-talk, for which only a basic lip-reading ability was required to detect a strong hint of the Joe Kinnears. \"I can't really itemise the words I used, but we were having a chat - or I was doing a soliloquy - because I didn't think we were honest with our capabilities,\" he said. The blast paid off as Saints reverted to safety-first, wet-weather rugby and pulled level at 12-12 with a scrappy Matt Gidley try on their second set of the second half. But then Lee Smith produced a freakish 40-20 kick - described by Anderson as \"the key play of the whole game\" - to set up the position for Danny McGuire to put Leeds ahead again. Despite Ade Gardner's 28th Super League try of the season, Saints never seemed to have enough vigour or conviction to launch one of the late fightbacks for which they used to be renowned. Anderson refused to blame that lack of energy on the play-off structure, which had restricted his players to two matches in the five weeks since their Challenge Cup final win against Hull on August 30. But the strategy of resting up, with a three-day break in Madrid, must now be judged a failure and Saints will surely try something different if they are involved in the play-offs next year. The Super League clubs are still debating some radical proposals for the structure of those top-eight play-offs, one of which involves allowing the top three teams to choose their opponents in the first round. Whatever happens, the issue of the week off before the Grand Final will disappear, because the Old Trafford combatants will be determined by two semi-finals, as in Australia - where Manly, who finished second to the Melbourne Storm in this year's National Rugby League table, yesterday emulated Leeds with a 40-0 Grand Final victory which sets up a World Club Challenge against the Rhinos in February. But preparing Saints to make it third time lucky in next year's Grand Final is no longer Anderson's problem, because he will now fulfil the promise he made to his wife and four children of a return to Sydney after eight years on the road, even though he does not currently have an Australian coaching job to take up. \"Obviously it's not the way I wanted to go but I honestly don't see it as a shame for me, I see it as a huge privilege to be going back with 3\u00bd years of wonderful memories,\" he said. It is Mick Potter, another Australian who has driven the Catalans Dragons success story over the past three seasons, who must now steer Saints through what could be a tricky transitional phase as mainstays such as Long and Keiron Cunningham follow Paul Sculthorpe towards retirement in the next couple of years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
