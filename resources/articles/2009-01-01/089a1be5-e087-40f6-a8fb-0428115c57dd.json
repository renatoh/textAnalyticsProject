'To mark this passage through the half century we are going to be looking at life fifty years ago. In addition to what we will be doing in the lessons I will be expecting you all to do a bit of detective work.' A hand shot up in the front. 'Yes, Mavis.' 'Do you mean homework, sir?' 'In a sense, yes.' There was a smothered groan of protest. 'But not on your own. And you'll have plenty of time. The presentations won't be till the end of term.' 'Presentations?' muttered Henry. 'On Monday I asked you to write down what you did in the holidays and what you might wish for if you had a magic wand. That was my way of getting to know you a little better. I am putting you into twelve groups of three and one group of four. The first group will be Jane, Ivy and Doris. You expressed an interest in nursing and looking after babies. Your project is to find out about nursing in 1899. You three,' he said pointing to three friends in the front, ' you will look into marriage in 1899. I want to know about weddings for the rich and the poor. 'Davis, Kemp and Roberts, I want you to look into the lives of people who settled in America fifty years ago. One of you said he would like to live with the Red Indians. Which Indians? Sioux, Cherokee, Mohican? Find out about their customs and how they were treated then.' He then picked a football trio and a greyhound racing trio. Another group of three had to find out about sweet shops. 'Dodge, you will be looking at films. You will be working with Jeffries and Morgan.' Henry heard some of his classmates gasp. 'Morgan,' continued Mr Finch, 'you expressed interest in being a projectionist so maybe you could concentrate on how they showed the films then.' Pip was nodding and smiling. Henry could hardly make out what Mr Finch said next. The teacher's voice seemed muffled and a great acid gob of nausea had risen into Henry's mouth burning the back of his throat. Through the blur, he heard Mr Finch talking to the other groups. 'Every Friday I'll see how you're getting on,' he said, 'In December each group will give a short presentation to the class. Raise your arms those of you with grandparents or great aunts or uncles.' Henry slowly raised his hand. He noticed that Jeffries and Morgan didn't. 'Ask them what fourteen-year-old girls and boys were doing in 1899. And remember, if you listen to what people say, you'll discover that History lies not only in books but is all around you.' At the end of the lesson Henry was slow to put his books away. He watched Mr Finch tidy up, but instead of following the others out, he remained seated. 'Out you go, Dodge,' said Mr Finch. 'Sir,' Henry began quickly, 'Can you put me with another group?' 'I'm quite happy with the groups I've chosen. Now off you go.' 'But I can't be put with Jeffries, sir.' 'Why not?' 'It's family business, sir.' 'You're going to have to tell me more than that, Dodge.' Henry took a deep breath. 'My dad saved his father's life, but his dad never even turned up to my father's funeral. And he's a deserter.' 'And this happened when?' 'Nine years ago.' 'And did Jeffries fail to report to his unit?' 'No, sir,' said Henry puzzled. 'He was only five, sir.' 'Exactly. In other words whatever his father is guilty of, he is not guilty of the same crime.' 'But my grandmother would be upset.' 'I'm sorry about that, Dodge.' 'And we don't talk to one another.' 'Perhaps it's time you started.' Henry couldn't think of anything to say. 'Is that all, Dodge?' 'No, sir. There's Pip.' 'Pip?' 'Morgan. We don't mix with boys like him.' 'Oh? Why is that?' 'It's just one of those things. No-one does.' 'Does he have impetigo?' 'No, sir.' 'Or any other infectious disease?' 'No, sir. It's just my grandmother says that because he was born on the wrong side of the blanket it means . . . ' he paused. 'well, he's unlucky and if you're seen with him you'll be unlucky too with jobs and things.' Mr Finch stared silently at him for so long that it was unnerving. 'Do you know what being born on the wrong side of the blanket means?' he said eventually. Henry felt indignant. Of course he knew. 'It's the way you're born, sir. It's like a superstition.' 'Ah.' He gave a weary sigh. ' I think it's about time someone told you.' 'But I know, sir!' protested Henry. 'No you don't. Being born on the wrong side of the blanket means being illegitimate.' 'You mean he's a bastard?' said Henry, shocked. 'I believe that is the term. Unfortunately it often means that children like Morgan are stigmatised. But that will not happen in my form. I chose you to work together because you all have an interest in the cinema. Morgan is a pupil in my class and as such he will be treated equally. Is that understood?' 'Yes, Mr Finch,' Henry murmured. 'Now go along with you.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
