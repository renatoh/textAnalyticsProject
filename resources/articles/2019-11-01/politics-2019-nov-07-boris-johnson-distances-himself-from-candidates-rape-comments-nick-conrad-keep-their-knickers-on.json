Nick Conrad, a 34-year-old former radio presenter, was chosen on Wednesday evening to stand in the Broadland constituency in Norfolk. However, he withdrew on Thursday night, saying: \u201cIt has become clear to me that the media attention on my previous comments have become a distraction. \u201cFor me, the most important thing is for the Conservative party to be successful in the forthcoming election \u2013 getting Brexit done and delivering on the people\u2019s priorities. This is why I have reluctantly concluded I must stand down to allow one of the other excellent candidates the opportunity to win this fantastic seat.\u201d In a 2014 radio exchange about rape allegations, Conrad suggested women were \u201cpartially responsible\u201d for sexual assault. \u201cI think women need to be more aware of a man\u2019s sexual desire,\u201d he said on BBC Radio Norfolk. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in that position that you are about to engage in sexual activity there\u2019s a huge amount of energy in the male body. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of will and intent and it\u2019s very difficult for many men to say no when they are whipped up into a bit of a storm.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s the old adage about if you yank a dog\u2019s tail then don\u2019t be surprised when it bites you. You can\u2019t keep snakes in the garden and think they\u2019ll only bite your neighbours.\u201d Johnson, when asked on Thursday about the selection of Conrad, said: \u201cThose comments are completely unacceptable, he has apologised long ago but I can\u2019t stress [enough] that those comments are completely unacceptable.\u201d Both the Conservatives and Labour are processing dozens of new candidates for next month\u2019s general election. Conrad stood down as the Radio Norfolk breakfast host in order to seek the MP nomination after Keith Simpson, a longstanding one-nation Tory, announced he would not seek re-election. The 2014 radio discussion focused on the case of the footballer Ched Evans, who was originally convicted of a rape charge in May 2011. The conviction was quashed and overturned at a retrial in 2016. During the discussion, Conrad said if \u201ca woman says no\u201d and a man persisted then that was \u201cabsolutely abhorrent\u201d. But added: \u201cIf you tease, if you jump into bed naked with a man, if you give him all the signals and then he acts upon them, then you are partially responsible. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that women also have to understand that when a man\u2019s given certain signals, he\u2019ll wish to act upon them and if you don\u2019t wish to give out the wrong signals, it\u2019s best probably to keep your knickers on and not get into bed with him.\u201d Conrad apologised three days later, saying his remarks were ill judged and that he was sorry \u201cto anybody who was offended\u201d. Reacting to Conrad\u2019s selection as Tory candidate for Broadland, Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips said: \u201cIt\u2019s best to keep your knickers on to avoid rape according to this dude. I find it\u2019s best avoided by never coming in to contact with misogynistic men who have no understanding of consent.\u201d The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, described Conrad\u2019s comments as \u201cdespicable\u201d. She said: \u201cHe is not fit to be an MP and it would be an affront to women everywhere if he were to become one.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
