Geraghty scored six minutes from the end to help Irish to a fractious 23-20 victory that followed the unexpected win at Saracens a week earlier. The centre said: \"Everyone is looking up instead of down and what's happened off the field has given us a lot more security. The win at Saracens gave us a massive amount of confidence. James O'Connor's signing has been a real boost and we're a lot tougher mentally. Leicester will be an acid test for us next Sunday but they will have a few boys missing on England duty and we'll look to cause another upset.\" The club were taken over two months ago by a consortium, led by the Irish businessman Mick Crossan, that has promised the director of rugby, Brian Smith, an extra \u00a31.5m to spend on new players each season. The Harlequins No8 Tom Guest is on his way this summer and more players are expected to follow, with Irish in talks with Bayonne's former All Black fly-half Stephen Brett. Irish's win was soured by the sending off 10 minutes after the break of their former Ireland scrum-half Tomas O'Leary for a stamp on James Haskell. O'Leary faces a ban of up to two months. Meanwhile Smith said his England wing Marland Yarde was close to fitness after damaging a hip at Leicester in November. But Smith pointedly said that Yarde, who is swapping places with Guest in a move to Quins, was not certain to retain his place in an in-form Irish back three. Exeter's 36-year losing record against Bath continues with the visitors winning 27-23 at Sandy Park thanks partly to a flawless kicking display by George Ford, who did his England credentials no harm by converting all five of his kicks at goal in difficult conditions. Exeter's head coach, Rob Baxter, is to bolster his squad by signing the Scotland prop Moray Low from Glasgow Warriors this summer. The return to Harlequins of Dean Richards was not a happy one as his Newcastle side were beaten 18-14 despite a stirring second-half comeback. \"When the chips were down in the last 10 minutes we played some brilliant rugby,\" said Harlequins' director of rugby Conor O'Shea. Worcester are losing ground with the rest of the Premiership, a 14th successive defeat, at Northampton, leaving them 11 points adrift of Newcastle. GJ van Velze, the Northampton No8 who is moving to Worcester at the end of the season, scored two tries in the 30-14 win."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
