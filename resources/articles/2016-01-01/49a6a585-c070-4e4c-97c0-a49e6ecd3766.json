United have just 25 goals in their last 25 games and Van Gaal is conscious that this is not good enough. The manager believes a change of luck will help but is also willing to spend to try to turn United\u2019s season around. The Dutchman has overseen seven goalless draws this season, six of which have been at Old Trafford. Swansea City are the visitors on Saturday and as United are nine points behind Arsenal and Leicester City they have to start winning games if their faltering title challenge is to be reignited. Last month United failed to claim a single victory and were knocked out of the Champions League. It was the poorest December in the club\u2019s 138-year history and, as things stand, Wayne Rooney and Anthony Martial are United\u2019s joint top scorers in all competitions with seven each. \u201cIt [a lack of goals] can be solved with money but also on the training pitch,\u201d said Van Gaal, who on Friday recalled the 22-year-old striker Will Keane from a loan spell at Preston to bolster his attacking options. \u201cScoring goals is a quality. We have that quality but at this moment there is a lack of confidence at the right time or we need to buy another striker. It is always like that. \u201cThat is our problem [scoring]. When you analyse the matches we are always capable of playing in our style. Only Arsenal, and maybe the first half against Stoke and Palace, we didn\u2019t play in that style.\u201d United lost the first two of those games without scoring and drew the last 0-0. \u201cAll the rest, we had that style, we created chances and were the dominating team. But we didn\u2019t score. \u201cWe need also the luck of a striker. There are several players who played in the striker\u2019s position. They need luck. How many players have had the chances to score and why they didn\u2019t score? You cannot always explain that. \u201cOf course, we are looking always for solutions in the team. Also for this moment, but we still have a good team and we can still score goals. I am convinced of that. But we also need a little luck.\u201d In the summer Van Gaal sold Javier Hern\u00e1ndez to Bayer Leverkusen and Robin van Persie to Fenerbahce and allowed Radamel Falcao to leave following a one-year loan, and has since approved James Wilson\u2019s loan to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. \u201cWe could have kept all the strikers but then there would have been a lot of strikers in the tribune [stands],\u201d said the manager. \u201cThey are not happy then. They want to go away. It is the story of Hern\u00e1ndez, for example. He wants to play. There are now players in my selection who want to play. They cannot play because I choose another player. It is always like that. But too many strikers of high quality for the same position is too much pressure.\u201d United have lost all three of Van Gaal\u2019s matches with Swansea. \u201cIt is more or less the same test [as Chelsea]. The pressure that I have seen by myself is still the same,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot allow the gap to grow. We have to be there at the top of the league. That is our aim. We said that at the beginning of this season. The players are feeling like that also. They want to win because we didn\u2019t win several matches in a row.\u201d Phil Jones has echoed this view. The central defender believes if United can string a sequence of victories together the club will be back in the title race. \u201cIt\u2019s strange but the table shows that literally anyone can win the league this season,\u201d he said. \u201cArsenal, Chelsea, Leicester, City, ourselves, Tottenham, Stoke, Watford \u2013 nobody seems to want to win it. It only takes a good run of five, six, seven games and getting a few wins and it soon turns around. We\u2019re disappointed with the way we\u2019ve played over the past few games, although we did well against Chelsea, but by no means are we out of it [the title race]. If we can put a few wins together we\u2019ll be right back up there.\u201d On a positive note for United, they have kept more clean sheets than any other team in the Premier League this season \u2013 10 from 19 outings. \u201cI was always taught as a youngster that if you keep a clean sheet you\u2019ve got a great chance of winning the game, and we\u2019ve done that more often than not this season,\u201d Jones said. \u201cNorwich and Stoke were games in which we conceded sloppy goals, but other than those matches we\u2019ve been pretty solid. Everyone who\u2019s played has done their job and we hope we can carry that on and produce more clean sheets.\u201d Van Gaal was unmoved regarding whether Ryan Giggs, his No2, is exerting greater influence on team matters. \u201cNothing has changed. You can create something but nothing has changed,\u201d the 64-year-old said. The Dutchman also gave an update on Luke Shaw, who is recovering from a broken leg. \u201cHe is more or less having a short vacation,\u201d said Van Gaal. \u201cHe is away for a week. He is coming back on 1 January to continue with his recuperation. He is doing well but now I cannot be specific because he has been away for a week. \u201c\u201cEverything is going well until now. But I cannot say whether he will be back this season.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
