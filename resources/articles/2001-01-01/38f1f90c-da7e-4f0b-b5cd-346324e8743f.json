The National Union of Teachers said it was considering \"protective action\" in areas with chronic staff shortages. Doug McAvoy, the NUT's general secretary, said schools should move to a four-day week rather than forcing teachers into the \"invidious position\" of having to cover classes for which they were not qualified. \"Where it is pushing hardest we are simply not going to be in a position of expecting schools to continue to cover up,\" he said. An Education Department spokesman said: \"Industrial action is not the way to tackle the immediate problem of teacher shortages.\" Official figures released yesterday showed applications for postgraduate teaching courses were down 2,289 - 16.1% - on this time last year, despite the offers of \u00a36,000 training salaries and \u00a34,000 \"golden hellos\" in shortage subjects. Applications to teach maths, a golden hello subject, have fallen by 29.8%. Applications for teaching French have dropped 21.8% and for teaching English by 16.7%, according to the graduate teacher training registry (GTTR). John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"These figures represent a worrying picture for the future of teacher recruitment and suggest that the crisis is likely to get much worse before it gets better.\" Secondary applications are down 14.6%, from 5,190 to 4,434, and primary applications have fallen from 8,857 to 7,376. John Bangs, the NUT's assistant general secretary, said: \"The government still has not recognised the depth of the crisis.\" Research for the union by Liverpool University academics Alan Smithers and Pamela Robinson suggested recruitment problems were not confined to the south-east. Although there were more vacancies in outer London and the south-east, secondary head teachers found it more difficult to recruit in the west midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside, and Wales. Chris Waterman, general secretary of the Society of Education Officers, said that compared with other areas, London had more people on contracts but also a bigger pool of people on whom to call. \"London has a much less stable teaching force, but there is the flexibility to get people into teaching if the terms are good enough.\" Estelle Morris, the schools standards minister, will today offer 550 schools with poor exam results a share of a \u00a332m fund to help them retain staff. Some 281 schools will receive \u00a370,000 and 269 schools, which already get extra help from the excellence in cities or education action zone schemes, will receive \u00a320,000. Schools will be expected to spend the money on loyalty bonuses for teachers, particularly in shortage subjects, learning mentors to prevent truancy, or extra books. It could mean \"golden handcuffs\" of up to \u00a34,000 for some staff. Ms Morris will tell the north of England education conference in Bridlington that since 1997, 650 \"failing\" schools have come out of special measures. A \u00a37m advertising campaign by the Teacher Training Agency was launched last week, under the slogan, \"Those Who Can, Teach\". The government said it had triggered more than 1,300 calls to its recruitment helpline on Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
