The Marsh family\u2019s interpretation of One Day More clocked up 1.4m views, and made them internet stars with the lyrics (for example: \u201cOur grandparents are miles away / they can\u2019t work Skype, we\u2019re brokenhearted\u201d) being reworked to reference life during lockdown. Adrian Grimes and Dana Jay Bein\u2019s version of Queen\u2019s classic has clocked up 3.5m views, and turns it into \u201cbleak pastiche\u201d of the song with lines such as \u201cI\u2019m just a young boy, no job security\u201d. Both the songs share a dark sense of humour, are instantly recognisable to millions and have found an audience around the world. The latest song to go viral is from a group of Chicago-based stand-up comedians who shot a lo-fi video inspired by this year\u2019s Icelandic entry to Eurovision, Da\u00f0i Freyr\u2019s Think About Things. Garrett Williams and his housemates shot the video in two hours, edited it over a similar amount of time and then posted the results on Twitter \u2013 the video attracted more than 5m views within 24 hours of its release. \u201cMy roommate sent me the song and we were like \u2018this song slaps\u2019,\u201d said Williams. \u201cFrom there we were dancing to it and thought this could be a fun video, we made some suggestions for dance moves and outfits and put it all together.\u201d The method behind such a huge viral hit is surprisingly simple, according to Williams. He explained that the idea from the Michel Gondry-esque music video came from listening to the song and idly dancing before leaving the house to buy food. \u201cWe were waiting to go pick up food or go to the store together and we started to play the song and one of us was bouncing,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom that we thought \u2018oh let\u2019s just make a video where everyone is bouncing the whole time\u2019. That\u2019s it.\u201d Williams says he has had friends who have found work in comedy off the back of viral videos and usually timing posts to launch when your audience is largest is a key part of success. However, in lockdown conditions, Williams says there is a new captive audience at almost any time of day, thirsty for brazenly uplifting content. \u201cIn our sphere there\u2019s a lot of talk about the best time to post,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now everyone is at home no one has any idea about when the best time to post is. I sat on it for a day, and then my friends said just go for it, post it. So I did and it\u2019s blown up in 24 hours.\u201d Another motivation for Williams, Grimes and the Marsh family was to stay occupied while in isolation, with Williams saying the video \u201cfilled the void\u201d of not having work to be busy with. \u201cOur group likes to be on the go, we\u2019re always doing shows and trying to keep busy with work,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the quarantine situation we haven\u2019t had a project, so last week we had a couple of ideas floating around and made this one.\u201d There has been some negative reaction to the songs, particularly Grimes\u2019 cover of Bohemian Rhapsody. Grimes addressed criticism of the song\u2019s lyrics such as \u201cMama, I just killed a man / I didn\u2019t stay inside in bed / I walked past him, now he\u2019s dead,\u201d which were branded insensitive. He explained that his wife was involved in healthcare and so he was aware of the impact Covid-19 was having on people. Grimes encouraged people to maintain their sense of humour and said he had also received many \u201ccomments from people already affected by coronavirus have told me how much they appreciate this\u201d. Williams thinks the parody videos are proving so popular but people were looking for something fun to distract themselves during isolation and also spending more time online. \u201cAt this time when there is a lot of bleak news, and really heavy stuff coming through people are looking for something that they can disassociate to,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething that people can say \u2018oh, this is fun\u2019. We can still have fun and not have to be so scared all the time about everything.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
