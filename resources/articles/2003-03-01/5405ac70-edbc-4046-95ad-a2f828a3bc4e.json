You may well think Leeds' twin city is not worth a stop in its own right and that your time is better spent in nearby Brussels, Paris or even in a Calais hypermarket. But on a recent trip to next year's European City of Culture, I was persuaded otherwise. In fact, Lille offers much of the excitement of Paris - art treasures, fantastic food and drink, caf\u00e9 culture and sophisticated shopping - without the hassle of the overcrowded, overpriced, and often sullen, capital. The aesthetically minded should stay central and head straight for the old quarter - in particular the Vielle Bourse, an atmospheric relic of the Flemish renaissance, where book and flower-sellers gather in the afternoon under the 17th century cloisters. If you like old buildings then the ornate Hospice Comtesse will be right up your street. It is now home to an art museum of 15th-18th century Flemish, Dutch and Northern French works, but was originally a hospital founded in 1237. The immense Grande Place is as impressive as many of a similar vintage in Belgium and offers the visitor the sense of grandeur many look for in a European city-break. Many 17th and 18th century facades have been restored and generally provide a pleasant cityscape, although the futuristic business district \"Euralille\" served by the international rail station left me cold (and pleased to be a leisure visitor). For a functional shopping experience, you could head to the huge Printemps department store on Place Rihours. Euralille, predictably, is home to another giant shopping centre. The city's shopping is top notch and you can pick anything up - usually for far less than it is sold in the UK. The temptation to bargain hunt can lead to some over-laden trips home. In terms of fashion, everything is available - from the classy regulars of the French high-street: Zara, Naf Naf, Sephora, to very credible fakes. Avoiding the obvious tourist traps you'll find plenty of good cafes and brasseries (particularly on la rue de Gand) serving the local fare - carbonnades (beef braised in beer), potjevleesch (three white meats in aspic, I'm reliably informed), mussels and chips, and of course wonderful cheeses. The locally produced Maroilles and Coeur d'Arras are fiendish but fantastic. My co-travellers on the train back to London didn't thank me for buying a good supply of each and stashing them in my luggage for all to enjoy. There is also a refreshingly wide range of locally brewed beers (including raspberry and Christmas varieties as well as the more standard \"bi\u00e8res blondes\"). For a special treat, have dinner at La Terrasse des Remparts, an unusually designed restaurant perched on the former city gates. The food - and views - are excellent. In terms of nightlife, the city's 100,000-strong student population ensures that the streets are full into the early hours. You'll find cinemas and bars in the Halles district and in the old quarter. Jazz bars such as the Anglo-Saxo are popular, or you could opt for the Folies de Paris drag show. If you prefer some more highbrow culture, try the Ballet du Nord or the Theatre du Nord. A Mozart festival runs from October to March and the opera house re-opens in December 2003. Lille's main art gallery, the Beaux Arts museum, is said to be second only to the Louvres in Paris. It was restored, extended and re-opened in 1997 and houses European art from the 15th to the 20th century, including important works by Reubens, Van Dyck, Goya, Delacroix, Pradier and Rodin. For more modern tastes, Greater Lille's Museum of Modern houses works by Picasso, Braque, Laurens, Modigliani, Miro and Derain. If you're at a loose end on a Sunday morning - all the shops are closed - you could head to Wazemmes market. On the scale of Camden passage or Portobello Road in London, this is one varied market. Pashminas at four euros are hawked alongside fake designer bags, gastronomic delicacies and homemade beer. But be sure to keep your bag safe - I turned around just in time to catch someone fishing my wallet out of mine. For a total bargain-hunting extravaganza, time your visit to coincide with La Braderie, a city-wide car boot sale held on the first weekend in September. More than two million people descend on the city to pound the pavements in search of jumble. Or come for the bizarre slag heap festival (June 15 2003) - marking the regeneration of the scarred landscape after 280 years of local mining. The heaps themselves have been transformed into nature trails with protected wildlife and organised sports and entertainment. Admission is free. More events in the Lille calendar include the September beer festival, the December Christmas markets and of course the whole of 2004 for the City of Culture festivities. Lille's greatest pull is that it is so easy to get to from the UK - it takes just two hours on the Eurostar from London.Go now before the hordes flood in for 2004. \u00b7 Liane Katz travelled courtesy of Eurotunnel and the Pas de Calais and Nord tourist boards. \u00b7 More information, discount breaks and money-saving city passes are available from the Lille tourist office, Place Rihour, Lille; tel: +33 3 20 21 94 21."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
