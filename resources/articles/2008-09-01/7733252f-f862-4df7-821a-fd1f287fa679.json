The statement, made through a spokesman, came during a day of high drama after the national executive committee of the African National Congress said it had decided to 'recall' Mbeki from his post following a fraught meeting on Friday night that went on until early yesterday. 'Following the decision of the national executive committee of the African National Congress to recall President Thabo Mbeki, the President has obliged and will step down after all constitutional requirements have been met,' said the statement. The ANC secretary-general, Gwede Mantashe, said Mbeki had been calm 'as normal' when given the news. 'He welcomed the news and agreed that he is going to participate in the parliamentary process.' The decision clears the way for Mbeki's chief rival, Jacob Zuma, to take over the country. But the cabinet is likely to have to select an interim President because Zuma is not an MP and is therefore not qualified to stand. Mbeki has called for his cabinet to assemble today and Parliament is expected to meet in the coming days to formalise the resignation. Mantashe said Zuma was meeting cabinet ministers to persuade them to remain in their jobs. He said the top priority was to focus on 'ensuring the smooth running of the country'. 'We share the desire for stability and for a peaceful and prosperous South Africa,' Mantashe told reporters. Mbeki succeeded Nelson Mandela in 1999 and was due to stand down next year. After devoting his life to the ANC, he had been expected to go in the middle of next year, having completed two terms in office. His premature fall came after a high court judge ruled that there had been 'political meddling' in the decision to press ahead with corruption and fraud charges against Zuma, who ousted Mbeki as president of the ANC in December last year. In his ruling on 12 September, Judge Christopher Nicholson said it appeared that Mbeki and his Justice Minister had colluded with prosecutors against Zuma as part of the 'titanic power struggle' within the ANC. Mbeki has indignantly denied the accusations. The charges were linked to a multi-billion-rand arms deal involving, among others, British Aerospace. Zuma's financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, is already serving a 15-year jail term on similar charges. Yesterday Mantashe said that last week's decision by the National Prosecuting Authority to prolong the argument by appealing against the judge's ruling had been a factor in deciding to recall Mbeki. Zuma had reportedly said there was no need to chase Mbeki out of office because there was no point in beating a 'dead snake'. The crucial question that had been facing the country was whether Mbeki would fight for his political life, or dissolve parliament and call a general election, which could have reduced the country to a full-blown crisis. It appears the national executive had calculated that Mbeki would step down voluntarily. If he had not done so, it would have had to push for a parliamentary vote of no confidence in the President - which would have forced all ministers and deputy ministers to resign. Under the constitution, if the President resigns or dies, the Deputy President would take over. But the Deputy President, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka - a strong Mbeki supporter - has indicated she would resign with Mbeki. This would mean that an interim President would have to be chosen by cabinet or, failing that, strict rules on succession could lead to the speaker becoming leader until a new President is elected. ANC officials are appointed and recalled from their posts according to the wishes of the party - they are not directly elected. 'Parliament should have the last word, not some kangaroo court of the ANC NEC,' said opposition leader Bantu Holomisa, of the United Democratic Movement. 'Here is a person, not accused of any crime, being pushed out of office by a person who faces charges of fraud and corruption.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
