Across Sydney, buildings were evacuated regularly as fire alarms were triggered at random. During the morning commute, the sound of the ferries using their fog horns due to the poor visibility filled the area surrounding the harbour before the entire fleet was finally grounded. Schools kept children inside during their lunch break and face masks became a regular accoutrement as Sydney\u2019s landmarks were lost in the haze. Images of the Opera House, Harbour Bridge and Bondi Beach shrouded in smoke were shared widely on social media as the usual joie de vivre that greets the beginning of summer in this city gave way to anxiety over the lengthening bushfire crisis. A domestic cricket match between New South Wales and Queensland continued under a pall. Footage of the former Australian test player Steve O\u2019Keefe bowling spin in near darkness seemed to sum up the uncanny feeling that settled across the city. Former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, in town as part of an Australian tour, reflected it better than most: \u201cSydney looks spooky as fuck with all this smoke proper shitting it,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. A NSW Ambulance superintendent, Brent Armitage, said paramedics were attending up to 100 respiratory-related call-outs per day and the state\u2019s health department warned residents to stay indoors as much as possible amid \u201cunprecedented\u201d smoke pollution. The state\u2019s director of environmental health, Dr Richard Broome, said the smoke in Sydney was \u201csome of the worst air quality we\u2019ve seen\u201d. \u201cCertainly in Sydney we have experienced very poor air quality episodes in the past and the one I\u2019m most aware of is the 2009 dust storm episode where we had extremely high levels, but certainly this smoky period we\u2019ve been experiencing for the past month or so, it is unprecedented, so these conditions are a risk to people\u2019s health,\u201d Broome said. Buildings across the city had to be evacuated so regularly that the assistant commissioner of NSW Fire and Rescue, Roger Mentha, was forced to warn actual victims of fire not to rely on automatic alarms. Mantha said crews had responded to more than 500 automatic fire alarms across the city. \u201cThis amount of calls peaked between 11am and 12 midday with 154 automatic alarms, as a result there\u2019s also been over 335 triple-zero emergency calls,\u201d he told reporters in Sydney. Mentha said the volume of calls was unprecedented and had increased as the smoke cloud \u201cdescended on the city\u201d. Among those forced outside were the headquarters of the Rural Fire Service and one of the city\u2019s major newspapers, the Sydney Morning Herald. Fires have continued to burn throughout the eastern states, and in particular NSW, for the better part of a month with no reprieve in sight. Six people have died, almost 700 homes have been destroyed and at least 2.7m hectares have burned. Fires stretch the distance of the NSW coastline. Drought has gripped this part of Australia for several months and some coastal towns face the possibility of running out of water by January if summer rains fail to materialise. Tuesday had been labelled a potentially \u201clethal\u201d day by the commissioner of the RFS, Shane Fitzsimmons, as 40C degree temperatures and hot gusty winds whipped up flames. More than 80 fires were burning across NSW on Tuesday, while firefighting crews in Victoria and Queensland are also battling a number of blazes. On Tuesday evening, a fire burning on the state\u2019s central coast, the Little L Complex fire, was upgraded to an emergency level, and was 67,000 hectares in size and uncontained. One fire at Gospers Mountain, north of Sydney, has already burned through some 319,000 hectares. The fire has burned steadily for weeks, and previously merged with other blazes to form one long sweeping fire-front. Further north, residents in isolated bush communities in the state\u2019s Hunter Valley became ringed by fire and were expected to be completely cut off. With no obvious end \u2013 other than rain \u2013 to the crisis, the state\u2019s former fire chief Greg Mullins warned on Tuesday that firefighters may have \u201cnothing left in the tank\u201d as they battle with an abnormally long and extensive fire season. \u201cEveryone is getting pretty worn out and, in my experience, that\u2019s where all the bad stuff happens,\u201d he told AAP. \u201cThe troops, if they\u2019re worn out, you get to a stage where it just overwhelms everyone, so that\u2019s a worry. \u201cI\u2019m buggered ... and I haven\u2019t done as many [shifts] as some people. People will step up. Firefighters \u2013 they are men and women who give their all \u2013 they will do whatever is asked of them and more but I do fear for their welfare.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
