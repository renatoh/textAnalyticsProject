It would be nice but if I don\u2019t, I\u2019m OK with that as well.\u201d Talking in an interview for Amazon Prime with his first full-time coach, Mark Petchey, the triple-slam champion, who turned 32 last month, was frank about his circumstances. \u201cThe first six or seven weeks [of rehab] were pretty hard, uncomfortable,\u201d he said. Trying to exercise through that wasn\u2019t particularly nice. \u201cBut the quicker you get it moving, the quicker you\u2019ll be back on your feet again. Then I\u2019d say from weeks eight and nine, it\u2019s really started to go quite nicely. [I\u2019ve] been able to do a lot of things I have not done for a really long time without pain. Playing golf and walking the dogs is fun and enjoyable now, whereas it was pretty uncomfortable for a couple of years.\u201d Murray\u2019s home life, after 15 years on the road, is centred on spending quality time with his wife, Kim, and their two young daughters. It sounds as if he is enjoying the change, although he admitted he may be hard to live with sometimes. \u201cWhen I can help out with the five o\u2019clock wake-ups, it\u2019s nice to have me around, but the rest of the time they\u2019d like me out of the house.\u201d He also wants to see more than the four walls of a hotel room and the journey to and from courts. \u201cIf I do get back to playing, something I\u2019d try to do a bit more of is spend more time out in the cities, seeing sights, exploring. We get to go to amazing places, some of the nicest cities in the world. Often we spend most of our time at the courts practising and in hotels, having room service. It\u2019s not what people might imagine it to be \u2013 if you\u2019re trying to do everything properly.\u201d Murray told Petchey there has been no shortage of support for him in the locker room. \u201cIt has been nice,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Australia [after he lost in the first round and the organisers played a video on court of messages from the leading players] it was tough because I didn\u2019t know what the outcome of anything was going to be. The genuine feeling at that stage was that I might not be playing again. \u201cI\u2019ve always been at arm\u2019s length with a lot of the players. I am not massively close with loads of guys in the locker room. There\u2019s a few that I get on with really well. Who have I had messages from? I\u2019ve had a couple of messages from [Roger] Federer. [Stan] Wawrinka, he\u2019s messaged me a couple of times. Rafa [Nadal], once or twice \u2013 and a lot of the British players. \u201cIf the match I played in Australia [losing to Roberto Bautista Agut in five sets] was my last one, it would be an amazing way to finish as well. It was a great match, brilliant atmosphere. As I get older, especially because of what I have been through the last couple of years, I\u2019ve realised it\u2019s not about winning all the time. It\u2019s actually about giving your best effort. That day, I could not have given more than what I had.\u201d Meanwhile Johanna Konta has pulled out of next week\u2019s Nottingham Open after her run to the French Open semi-finals. \u201cAfter Paris my body is pretty exhausted from all the matches I have played,\u201d said the British No 1, who has reached the past two finals in Nottingham and last year was beaten by the new French Open champion, Ashleigh Barty. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favourite events so I\u2019m disappointed not to be there.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
