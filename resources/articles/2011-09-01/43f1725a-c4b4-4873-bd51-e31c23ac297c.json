For those in the dark about Strictly, the series always begins with Bruce Forsyth (a tap-dancing octogenarian boasting a hairpiece made of finest skinned meerkat) lining up the chunky, wobbly celebs and the hard bum-cheeked professional dancers, and then pairing them up. Typically, naughty Bruce reads out each dancing duo while hinting heavily that tons of illicit sex will be going on. Everyone in the audience loves this and guffaws loudly, aside from the celebs' hapless, long-suffering, soon-to-be upgraded partners, who rictus grin into their plastic tumbler of putrid BBC boxed chardonnay. Until Christmas, the main game of Strictly is for the celeb and their dancing partner to slip into a Stockholm syndrome-style tryst where the celeb feels angry, humiliated and legally committed to spend time with this exercise freak, typically leading to a mutual infatuation. The celeb loses loads of weight, most of their marbles and begins swanning into the BBC Television Centre wearing lilac Pineapple Dance Studio leg warmers and a towelling headband mumbling about \"knowing my value on the Strictly tour\" and \"being pushed to new levels of joy\" \u2013 which could mean \"on the dancefloor\" but we all secretly hope means \"in the Novotel adjacent to the west London flyover with their mobile phone switched off.\" Every Saturday we observe the descent into loopiness, communicated via the power of ballroom dancing. It's judged by people such as Bruno Tonioli, who rises off his seat and says \"YOU LIKE A HOT SPICY SALAMI\" or \"YOU HEAVY LIKE BAD TIRAMISU\" or Alesha Dixon, ex-Mis-Teeq (who did that The Boy Does Nothing song, which was basically just Mambo Number 5 by Lou Bega except about housework). Craig Revel Horwood's job is to make the contestants cry by telling them they're a national laughing stock and will most probably die alone in a house with asbestos walls covered in rat droppings (or something much worse). Contestants I am wholly excited about this year include Robbie Savage, whom I know from appearances on my TV screen on Saturday nights \"punditing\" in what can only be described as a khaki three-piece safari leisure-suit, worn with friendship beads and a Sun-In tinted 90s rave Dougal hairdo. I don't know his football, but I like the cut of this Savage man's jib. Edwina Currie, Jason Donovan and Holly Valance I can take or leave, but my main focus this year will be the heavily sensuous presence Nancy Dell'Olio, or \"Italian Siren Nancy\" as she is being billed by bewildered screen-caption writers. I love Nancy: in a world filled with \"women's self-esteem issues\" this woman's cup runneth over with confidence. \"Es a senshual thing for woman, y'know, the dancing?\" is the sort of thing Nancy would say to Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight as he pulls a face like a swan choking on a mint Viscount. Nancy does not speak very good English but this does not stop Nancy speaking a lot of English. Or Nancy-English. Or Nanglish. Keep on dancing, Nancy, Saturday night needs you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
