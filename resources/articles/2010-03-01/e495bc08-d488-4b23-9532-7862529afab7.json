Ejup Ganic, an engineering professor and former president and vice-president of Bosnia, was arrested on 1 March while attempting to fly from Heathrow airport. He was seized on an extradition request from Serbia, which accuses him of war crimes at the beginning of the Bosnian war in May 1992. Ganic, a regular visitor to Britain and a personal friend of Margaret Thatcher, has been in Wandsworth prison for the past 10 days and was refused bail for fear he would flee the country. He was released today on \u00a3300,000 bail under \"stringent\" conditions, pending a hearing on the Serbian extradition demand at the end of the month. The Bosnian president and Muslim leader, Haris Silajdzic, protested bitterly at the treatment of Ganic today after travelling from Sarajevo to London. He saw Paddy Ashdown, the former international governor of post-war Bosnia, and the foreign secretary, David Miliband, to complain that Ganic was being treated disgracefully. Silajdzic said tonight he was \"shocked\" that Ganic had been deprived of his medicine, denied consular help and the use of a telephone in Wandsworth. The Bosnian leader demanded an apology from the government, which insisted the affair was purely a legal matter. Thousands of people have been protesting outside the British embassy in Sarajevo this week demanding Ganic's release. The 64-year-old was investigated years ago by the UN war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague, which concluded that there was no case to answer. The British court decision ordering Ganic's arrest wrongly stated that he was wanted for crimes allegedly perpetrated in Serbia. The alleged crime in question took place in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. The case is highly political, with Serbia issuing indictments against politicians in Bosnia and demanding that Ganic be tried in Belgrade, sparking tit-for-tat extradition calls from Bosnia. \"It appears from the [Hague] investigation that the incident in question did not give rise to a crime at all. On that basis, we say that the Serbian request is not made in good faith as there is no evidence to support it,\" said Stephen Gentle, one of Ganic's lawyers. But in Bosnia, where the ethnic divisions between Muslims and Serbs are bitterly entrenched, leading Serbian politicians are relishing the prospect of Ganic's delivery to Belgrade for trial. \"I am sure that Serbia has completely valid proof of Ganic's responsibility for war crimes,\" said Rajko Vasic, a leader of the ruling party in the Serbian half of Bosnia. Ganic was arrested on the same day that the Bosnian Serb wartime leader and genocide suspect, Radovan Karadzic, finally mounted his defence in The Hague after having lived as a fugitive in Serbia for 13 years. The Serbian authorities furnished 800 pages of evidence against Ganic to the British this week. The allegations centre on Ganic's role in an infamous incident at the start of the Bosnian war when Serb forces encircled Sarajevo. It was the start of a 44-month siege during which they killed 10,000 people. The Bosnian leader, Alija Izetbegovic, was taken hostage by Serb forces at Sarajevo airport when returning from peace talks in Portugal. In Sarajevo, the main Yugoslav army garrison of mostly Serb troops was surrounded. A tense negotiation brokered by the UN traded Izetbegovic for the evacuation of the Yugoslav troops. Ganic, as Izetbegovic's deputy, was in charge. As Izetbegovic was released, the withdrawing convoy was attacked, leaving some 40 soldiers dead. The Serbian indictment charges Ganic with direct responsibility for 18 soldiers' deaths."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
