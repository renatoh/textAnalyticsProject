The hack occurred round about the time of Cheggs and Bacon, the flagship breakfast show. Within seconds, thousands of people had spotted it. It seems CBTV has become something of a cult hit among techies - I only know this because one pointed out the attack must have happened on Monday morning as he'd been watching it all weekend. Apparently, though, they're only studying it for an example of broadband/interactive TV, and nothing to do with a Cheggers obsession. Thank heavens for that. Massive cuts are sweeping through Tiscali, the Italian stallion that has been busy buying operation after operation and now has to find a way of bringing them all together. Its UK buys - WorldOnline, LibertySurf and LineOne - present something of an integration headache given the collective staff numbers. According to documents seen by my esteemed colleagues at The Register, Tiscali needs to get rid of 300 UK employees and trim down to just 170, and all before June 1. The way things are going, however, it seems that LineOne staff (especially management) will be the ones who will end up controlling Tiscali UK. Funny the way things turn out, isn't it? Broadcasters have well and truly cottoned on to the text messaging sensation sweeping the nation. The latest example to catch Diary's eye is being sent round by viral email encouraging people to get involved with a planned BBC show called The Joy of Text. \"Lively, outgoing people with a passion for text messaging\" are asked to contact the BBC, but only by email or phone call, and absolutely no sign of a mobile number to text your replies to. Surely they've missed an obvious trick here? It's not long now for beenz, the web currency that in the end no one bothered to use. In less than a month the business will be wound down, unless a miracle happens, and beenz will go down in internet history as a high profile failure. \u00a356m in two years - not quite boo.com but still an expensive experiment. The founder, Charles Cohen, a former Liberal Democrat speechwriter, is not sticking around to see the sad demise. Reasons for his sudden departure are being concealed, bringing back memories of the shock departure of his chairman and CEO Phil Letts last year. The only explanation given for Cohen's exit was that it was superfluous to have such a big management team for a company of 30 people. Either Cohen had a very fat salary or he was a deterrent for investors. The truth will out. \u0095 Amy Vickers is new media editor of MediaGuardian.co.uk amy.vickers@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
