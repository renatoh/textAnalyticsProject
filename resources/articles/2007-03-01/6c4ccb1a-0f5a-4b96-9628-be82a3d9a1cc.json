According to officials in Brussels and ministers in eastern and western Europe, the German leader plans to have the charter wrapped up by February. To avoid controversy and division and to try to avoid national referendums, the blueprint reshaping how Europe is run would no longer be called a constitution. While retaining the key points, it would also be a fraction of the size of the document agreed by EU governments in 2004 but then rejected by French and Dutch voters in referendums in 2005. Ms Merkel aims to set up a conference of government officials from all 27 members countries in June to thrash out the details by the end of the year. The chancellor used her first European summit as EU president last night to sound out other leaders on the wording of a declaration to be issued later this month to mark the EU's 50th birthday. She is seeking to use the so-called Berlin Declaration, to be signed by European leaders on March 25, as a springboard for reviving the moribund European constitution. The aim is to set up a rolling conference of EU governments in June to draft a charter by December which will be endorsed by all 27 governments by February 2008, according to senior sources in European capitals. But Berlin still has to persuade the doubters, most notably Britain which was delighted to see the constitution stalled by French and Dutch voters. The German timetable will also present Gordon Brown with a headache if it coincides with his accession, although the Blair government has already agreed to the key changes in the way the EU is organised. These are: a single fixed-term EU presidency ending the current system of six-month rotation among 27 countries; a single European \"foreign minister\" representing a common EU line in international affairs although the post will probably no longer be entitled \"foreign minister\"; and a system of double majority voting in EU councils which erodes national vetoes and which, for the first time, recognises Germany's position as the biggest and most powerful EU country. These were the central changes agreed in 2004 and derailed in 2005 and are likely to survive in the new \"simplified\" version being negotiated. West European sources familiar with the negotiations believe Mr Blair could strike a deal in June. A European foreign minister said Mr Brown had \"a great interest in finding a solution very quickly, so it could be forgotten before any general election in 2009\". Following the Berlin summit beginning on March 25 Ms Merkel hopes to end her EU presidency at another summit in June by establishing a so-called inter-governmental conference to thrash out the details. To make the project more palatable to sceptics such as Britain, Poland, and the Czech Republic and also, crucially, to try to avoid any need for popular referendums on the blueprint, the charter will no longer be called a constitution, but a \"treaty\" or \"simplified treaty\", according to sources. Ms Merkel has reached a deal with the next two EU presidents, Portugal and Slovenia, to promote the project. \"The big problem at the June summit will be agreeing the mandate for the IGC,\" said a senior government minister from central Europe. \"If there is agreement, it will be a big success for Merkel.\" A series of coincidences are conspiring to strengthen her hand. The gathering in Berlin will be Jacques Chirac's last EU summit. The crucial June session will be Mr Blair's last European summit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
