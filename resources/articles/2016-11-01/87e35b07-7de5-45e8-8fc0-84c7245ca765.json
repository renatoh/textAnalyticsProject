His The Chaser (2008) and The Yellow Sea (2010) flagged up a natural instinct for propulsive narratives \u2013 but Na Hong-jin lets this intensity drag him over the brink of an abyss of fear and superstition in his new rural-horror The Wailing. As Kwak Do-won\u2019s slapdash country police sergeant cop investigates a series of violent murders apparently linked to a strange sickness, Na carefully blindsides with the kind of bungling police procedural familiar from Bong\u2019s Memories of Murder; the comedy, though, quickly steepens into a calamitous atmosphere in which anything could be unleashed. The village\u2019s suspicions fall on a Japanese vagrant rumoured to have malevolent powers, and efforts to rid the area of him reach frenzy pitch in one astonishing scene. Then, the hunt rounding on the investigators, Na remarkably shows that he\u2019s been keeping several gears in reserve. The layers of dissembling and self-dissembling pile up so thickly that not only does Na evidently touch on something integral about the nature of evil, but actually seems to be in the process of summoning it before your eyes. A supremely unsettling invocation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
