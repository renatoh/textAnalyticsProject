Every doctor will be licensed by the government and have to pass a five-year MoT to prove they are fit to practise, according to the Department of Health. Those who fail to meet the necessary standards or who do not wish to participate will have their licence removed and be barred from treating patients or prescribing medicines. The proposal is part of the DoH's plans to reform the General Medical Council (GMC), the regulatory body for doctors, to make it more open and accountable. It will be a criminal offence to pretend to have a licence. Health minister John Hutton said the reforms should strengthen public confidence in the GMC. The council was severely criticised in the wake of the Bristol babies and Alder Hey organs scandals. \"We want to see a more streamlined GMC with much greater patient and public involvement. One where cases are dealt with more quickly and transparently,\" said Mr Hutton. \"In particular, licences will assure patients that the doctor that is caring for them is performing to the high standards we expect in a 21st century NHS.\" The consultation paper, Reform of the General Medical Council, proposes that 40% of the GMC's central council should be lay members, compared to the 25% at the moment. It also recommends making the council smaller so it can deal with cases more quickly. The report calls for non-GMC members to be included on panel hearings and for simpler \"fitness to practise\" disciplinary arrangements. The five-yearly MoT, known as revalidation, is expected to begin in 2004, with the entire profession tested by 2009. The measures have been developed by the GMC in consultation with patients and the medical profession. The council's president, Sir Graeme Catto, said: \"I am pleased that the government has accepted our proposals for reform. \"We have worked hard to get to this point and consulted widely to ensure that this is right package. I am delighted that we are now working together to deliver the changes that will ensure the GMC continues to function effectively for both patients and doctors.\" Dr Ian Bogle, chairman of the British Medical Association, welcomed the proposals. He said: \"Doctors want to see a system of professionally led regulation which commands the confidence of patients and doctors. \"We will continue to work closely with the GMC to develop a system that is rigorous but does not duplicate other checks on doctors' performance and does not take too much time away from patient care.\" Doctors are already taking part in annual appraisals to identify which areas of their work need strengthening and these tests would feed into the new revalidation process."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
