In his first interview since the devastating Hutton report, he also said the presidential-style address made by Tony Blair's former spin doctor on the day the report was published was like having \"your head kicked in\". Humphrys, the host of BBC Radio 4's Today programme, who himself became embroiled in the affair after describing the Iraq intelligence report as \"cobbled together\", went on to say that Mr Campbell's \"triumphalist behaviour has probably helped the BBC\". \"The day Hutton was published was hellish. When Alastair Campbell made his presidential appearance at the foot of a grand staircase, it felt like lying in the gutter while your head's kicked in,\" he told the Radio Times. \"I'm not going to get into a pissing match with him. I've known him for a long time. I like him and he's loyal, amusing and clever, but he's tried to destablise the BBC in a pretty tacky way. \"Maybe he thought we were an easy target because we're dependent on the government of the day. He suggests, preposterously, that I sneer at ministers - he knows a great deal about that because he's done for a long time - and he damned near accused me of lying. \"I'm more than happy to have my record weighed in the balance with his. The public can make their own judgments. His triumphalist behaviour has probably helped the BBC,\" said Humphrys. Mr Campbell today said he had nothing to say about Humphrys. \"Why should I bother? Why should I care about what John Humphrys says?\" he said. Mr Campbell's speech following Lord Hutton's verdict that the BBC's journalism and management was \"defective\" has already drawn the ire of the deposed BBC chairman, Gavyn Davies, who is considering whether to sue for defamation after he was accused of lying. And at the weekend the Culture secretary Tessa Jowell admitted that the \"bullying and aggressive\" behaviour exemplified by Mr Campbell was likely to cost the government votes. In his speech Mr Campbell declared: \"What the report shows very clearly is this: the prime minister told the truth. The government told the truth. I told the truth. The BBC, from the chairman and director general down, did not.\" 'Today must hold nerve' It was vital, he said, that the Today programme should \"hold its nerve\". \"There's been damage to the programme's confidence but Kevin Marsh, the programme's editor, has been robust, and that's what matters. The biggest risk is ourselves. \"We have to hold our nerve. If someone takes a swipe, you flinch, but you don't cover your head and say, 'Please don't do it again'. Nor do you punch them back in the nose if you're a civilised bloke,\" he said. Humphrys' typically outspoken attack on Mr Campbell is in direct contrast to the attitude of calm stoicism acting director general Mark Byford has tried to foster since taking over from the deposed Greg Dyke in the wake of the Hutton report. Humphrys said today he didn't believe that Mr Dyke and Mr Davies should have resigned. On Friday the Today programme heightened fears among BBC journalists that it was becoming hyper-sensitive to government criticism in the wake of Hutton when it broadcast a two-minute long statement from the Ministry of Defence \"clarifying\" defence secretary Geoff Hoon's position on the 45-minute claim. Later that day Mr Byford said the job of the BBC was \"first and foremost to report news in a reliable, accurate and impartial manner\". \"The notion of exclusive here, exclusive there, exclusive everywhere is not appropriate for the BBC in the sense it is giving the flavour of competing with newspapers or whatever in bringing original exclusives,\" he said. Humphrys, who gave the interview last week before Mr Byford made his comments, said he stood firm in his belief that the programme should break stories as well as report the news. 'The BBC must continue to break news' \"It's been suggested that the BBC shouldn't break news. What are we meant to do - discover a story and let someone else report it? One thing Today exists for is to put ministers under fair pressure so they tell you something they didn't mean to,\" he said. \"We don't have a 30-second delay while an editor listens to every word and orders, 'Stop!', that would be preposterous and the end of the programme,\" argued Humphrys, who has been one of the presenters on the show since 1987 and has also attracted criticism for not scripting his conversation with Gilligan. \"I'm not saying we won't become more boring but it's wrong to suggest we'll change because a judge said we made a mistake. We knew we had. It would be bizarre if we didn't occasionally, broadcasting live three hours a day, six days a week,\" he said. Humphrys confessed he \"was just coming awake\" when Gilligan made his infamous 6.07am broadcast suggesting the government had inserted the 45-minute claim knowing it to be wrong, which became the basis of most of Lord Hutton's criticism of the corporation. \"Stories at that time are usually less important than ones we save later for our main audience,\" he said. In the interview Humphrys said he didn't think Mr Davies or Mr Dyke should have resigned. \"I'm not prepared to attack him or advance a view about why it happened. I'm not a law lord. But I don't think the chairman and director general should have resigned. They'd already apologised and set in train a series of changes,\" he said. Humphrys also spoke for the first time about the new rule banning him from writing his Sunday Times column. \"I'm unhappy about it but understand the reasons. I'm not weeping or gnashing my teeth.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
