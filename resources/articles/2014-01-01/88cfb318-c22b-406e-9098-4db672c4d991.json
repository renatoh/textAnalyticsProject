The BBC Trust chairman Chris Patten and director general Tony Hall will come under renewed pressure to show that the corporation has decisively changed a culture that allowed Savile to abuse his victims unchecked during more than 40 years as a presenter of TV shows including Top of the Pops and as a Radio 1 DJ. Savile died in 2011. Former court of appeal judge Dame Janet Smith's report will say the number of victims of Savile's sexual activities may never be known but that his behaviour had been recognised by BBC executives who took no action, according to the Observer. At least 138 victims are pursuing civil actions against the BBC. The paper quoted a source close to the Smith inquiry, expected to report next month, saying that \"many hundreds and potentially up to 1,000 people\" were victims of Savile while he was working for the BBC from the 1960s until his retirement in 2006. The source added that the extent of the abuse uncovered by the Smith inquiry was \"shocking\". Rob Wilson, the Conservative MP who has been a persistent critic of the BBC's response to the Savile scandal since the extent of the late presenter's sexual abuse first began to emerge in late 2012 in an ITV documentary, said the crisis would continue until the corporation faces up to its mistakes and changes the way it operates. \"If these latest reports from close to Dame Janet Smith's inquiry are true, it is truly shameful what has been allowed to take place on BBC premises without any action or punishment \u2013 and the public will find the fact that managers knew and did little or nothing quite sickening,\" Wilson told the Guardian. \"The BBC's culture of secrecy and its desire to cover up when faced with the harsh realities of its past and present mistakes does not serve it well. \"Lords Hall and Patten must finally summon the courage to change an organisation that has clearly lost its moral compass. \"Sadly, I have seen few signs that they grasp the size of the task before them and are ready to do what is necessary to force through change.\" John Whittingdale, the Tory MP and chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, which is conducting an inquiry into the future of the BBC, said the corporation was not the only public institution at fault for failing to prevent Savile's abuse. But Whittingdale added that it appeared it was not just Savile who had been able to use his position at the BBC to abuse vulnerable people. \"The first thing the BBC needs to do is make sure this culture has been removed,\" he said. \"It needs to make sure it has very strong safeguards in place.\" Spokesmen for the BBC Trust and the corporation's management said they were not able to comment on the Smith report, as it has not yet been delivered. The BBC Trust will publish the report, with the executive, headed by Hall, expected to issue a statement. A spokeswoman for the Smith inquiry had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. Peter Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood charity, which has been consulted on the inquiry, said: \"I think the 1,000 figure is based on 50 years of [Savile] offending. It has been said that he didn't have a quiet day in his life. \"There wasn't a day when he wasn't up to something, so 1,000 might not be far from the truth.\" The charity has provided support to Savile's victims, some of whom gave evidence to Smith, who led the inquiry into the murders by Dr Harold Shipman. Saunders said those who passed up the opportunity to report the entertainer simply allowed him to continue his predatory offending. \"I have heard a lot over the last 18 months and talked to Jimmy Savile's victims, and I have lost count of the number of people who have said they knew about the nature of the man.\" The BBC's world editor John Simpson told the Andrew Marr Show how he worked at the corporation at the same time as \"sleazebag\" Savile, but dismissed the suggestion that knowledge of his offending was widespread. He said: \"[The Observer article] gives the impression, wrongly I think, that everybody in the BBC knew about it \u2013 it didn't apply to me \u2013 and also knew about Savile and shut up about it. \"I was working all through that time. I remember what a sleazebag, nasty piece of work Savile was. But it didn't occur to me that this was going on. \"Of course something should have been done, and of course the BBC should have revealed it about itself.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
