In a rambling and at times incoherent 90-minute conversation with reporters Thursday, mayor Frank Jackson said that he disagreed with the DOJ\u2019s findings, and said that his office would be conducting its own review. \u201cIn terms of systemic failure, it relieves people of the responsibility to make decisions,\u201d he said, \u201cand people make decisions, and they should be made responsible for their decisions. Do we have problems? Yes. Do we have systemic failures? No.\u201d On 9 December, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that a civil rights investigation performed by his department found that Cleveland police officers engaged in \u201ca pattern or practice of unreasonable and unnecessary use of force,\u201d including deadly force. The investigation, which was highly critical of the Cleveland police department, was conducted at the request of the mayor; but while Jackson said he welcomed the report, he also appeared to want to distance himself from its findings. \u201cI just try to do the right thing, and wherever that leads me, I will go,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I will not listen to are those with agendas, or those who use this tragedy to promote agendas.\u201d Jackson, a Democrat who has been in office since 2006, said the day Rice was shot was the worst day of his mayoralty. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe there is a systemic failure; but we do have a problem. We will ferret out what that problem is, and then we will reach an agreement with the Justice Department on a consent decree.\u201d He said that negotiations were already underway, and added that if his office could reach an agreement with the DOJ, then they would be happy to have an external monitor. The mayor spoke of his admiration for the \u201csincerity\u201d of those protesting the shooting of Rice, but also praised the city\u2019s Public Safety Director, Michael McGrath, who has been facing calls to resign. Jackson called him \u201cthe only person \u2026 who put himself in the line of fire.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
