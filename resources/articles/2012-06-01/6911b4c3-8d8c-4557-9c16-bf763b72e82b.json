Perry became part class tourist, part ethnographer to create the works, the genesis of which is charted in a three-part Channel 4 series All in the Best Possible Taste, which started on Tuesday. The tapestries \u2013 there are six of them \u2013 are a riff on A Rake's Progress; like William Hogarth's 18th-century paintings they tell the story of a man as he rises from working-class obscurity to greatness \u2013 and then falls again. If Hogarth's Tom Rakewell ends up in Bedlam, Perry's Tim Rakewell meets his end in a car crash, the emblems of his lifestyle \u2013 fancy car, Louis Vuitton bag \u2013 scattered uselessly around him. Death will put an end to everything, the tapestry tells us. Class trappings will not follow us to the grave. The tapestry shown above is the fourth in the set \u2013 \"the heart of the whole drama of taste\", says Perry. \"The rainbow represents that Berlin Wall of taste that you step through when you enter the sunlit uplands of the upper-middle classes\". The tapestry is called The Expulsion From No 8 Eden Close. Like all the works in the series, it draws on a great religious painting as source material, in this case Masaccio's Expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Tim, with his university girlfriend, is cast out from the realm of the new-build housing estate where his mother lives to enter the world of the aspirational north London dinner party. At the table sit members of the chattering class, safely cradled in a room lined with William Morris wallpaper. They are eating bruschetta and salad copied from images Perry found in a Jamie Oliver cookbook. In fact the disembodied face presiding over the scene is Oliver himself, the \"smiling god of class mobility\". The men resemble people whom Perry met in his peregrinations around the middle classes. The woman in the foreground is clearly \u2013 with her signature lime green spectacles and bob \u2013 Perry's wife, psychotherapist and author Philippa Perry. The blonde woman at the table is \u2013 at least according to Perry's gallerist Victoria Miro, and Philippa \u2013 me. The artist sniggers mischievously when I bring this up. \"Any resemblance to people living or dead is purely coincidental,\" he says. On the bookshelves is a spine marked \"Latin\"; another \"Understatement\": Perry's sly nod to the cultural capital hoarded by the chattering classes. The next tapestry in the series explores an older Tim, enjoying an even more prosperous middle-class setting, complete with Aga and recycling boxes \u2013 not to mention a copy of the Guardian. Its banner headline is Katie Price to judge Booker prize (which probably would make the front page, were such a scandalous lapse of taste on the part of the organisers to occur). Why taste and class? \"Because people care about it. People cringe, people look embarrassed, people laugh about taste,\" says Perry. \"Why do they do it? Why do I get embarrassed about lapses in taste? All this emotion tells me there is something worth investigating \u2026 I always follow a subject when I detect strong feeling in it. \"And I have realised taste is not something that is necessarily the preserve of the self-conscious middle classes. People make taste decisions all the time, in all walks of life.\" Of himself, Perry says: \"I have a thick crust of Islington but if you cut me, you would find Essex there. The tone of my taste decisions is often very Essex, but I put an Islington spin on them. That might be the deciding factor in my entire oeuvre \u2013 I am an exquisite punk.\" Grayson Perry's new tapestries are at Victoria Miro Gallery, London N1 from 7 June to 11 August. All in the Best Possible Taste continues on Tuesday 12 June at 10pm on Channel 4."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
