The 27-year-old man \u2013 whose name Guardian Australia has chosen not to publish \u2013 had been held on Manus Island for more than two years. He was removed from the detention centre\u2019s Oscar compound last Thursday and put in solitary confinement. Before being deported, he wrote and signed a letter that read: \u201cNot leaving the compound that I am living in and/or not wish to be returned to my country of origin against my will.\u201d The man\u2019s asylum claim was initially rejected, and he refused to participate in a second review, arguing the process was unfair. Six guards escorted him to Tehran, including two Australians. None was in uniform. The man was allowed by Iranian authorities to return to his home, but reported having his passport seized and was ordered to report to police. Lawyer Ben Lomai, who appeared before the PNG supreme court on Thursday, challenging the detention of asylum seekers on the grounds that it is unconstitutional, told Guardian Australia he had sought an injunction \u201cto stop refoulement\u201d of asylum seekers while the case was being heard. The man deported is one of more than 300 asylum seekers for whom Lomai is acting. \u201cI am very disappointed, very angry, that this is being done in this covert way. The government should be dealing with these asylum seekers in a manner which is transparent and fair, not secretly deporting them,\u201d Lomai said. \u201cThe case is already on foot, the government should respect the process.\u201d The PNG constitution guarantees \u201cliberty of the person\u201d, \u201cright to freedom of movement\u201d and \u201cfreedom from inhuman treatment\u201d, as well as the right of access to PNG courts and to a lawyer. Lomai argues asylum seekers have been denied these fundamental rights, and the state is required to release the men and compensate them. He said the government\u2019s decision to deport a man while his case was under way could be in contempt. The case continues before the PNG supreme court on Friday. In recent weeks asylum seekers on Manus Island have been told they will be deported \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d if their claim for refugee status and any subsequent appeal fails. Documents issued by PNG\u2019s Immigration and Citizenship Service Authority warned stateless asylum seekers, or those who cannot be returned to their home country, that they would be held in detention indefinitely, until they managed to secure a visa to another country. \u201cIf you choose to depart voluntarily, you will be eligible for Assisted Voluntary Return and reintegration assistance from the Internal Organisation for Migration ,\u201d the document said. \u201cIf you are involuntarily removed, you will receive no financial assistance.\u201d People issued with a removal notice would be kept in detention and \u201cmay be held in any location, including correctional institutions, while your removal is being effected\u201d. In a section headed \u201cDo I have any other options?\u201d the document stated \u201cNo\u201d. \u201cYou do not have the option of remaining in Papua New Guinea,\u201d it said. \u201cYou do not have the option of going to Australia. You will never go to Australia.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
