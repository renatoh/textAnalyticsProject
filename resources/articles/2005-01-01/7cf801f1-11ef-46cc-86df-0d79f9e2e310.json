There is a solid conviction that outlandish events are particularly likely when one of his sides is in action. The randomness can be intoxicating and surely no other manager could see his team win after being 3-0 behind and a man down, as City did to beat Spurs at White Hart Lane in the same competition last year. Even so, the typical Keegan volatility is becoming less of a boon and the cringeworthy failure at Boundary Park had always been conceivable. It came, after all, from the people who, in November 2003, brought us a loss to Groclin, the obscure Polish club who would immediately be swamped 5-1 on aggregate by Bordeaux in the next round of the Uefa Cup. Keegan's record, though, is no mere chronicle of inadequacies and any City fan will long cradle the memory of the 4-1 rout of Manchester United last season. At present, too, the manager presides over a precarious respectability. City are ninth in the Premiership, even if they are at the head of a group of six clubs covered by just two points. The trouble, of course, is the price that has been paid to set up home in the middle ground. Keegan has been known to change his mind, but you wonder how hard the directors will really try to deter him from retiring in 2006. City's are renowned for being some \u00a362m in the red and when the manager leaves the debt will stay. Two years ago the sensible David Bernstein even resigned as chairman in protest at a financial policy the rest of the board were prepared to endorse. The purchase of a declining Robbie Fowler may have been a landmark mistake, but fans can brood just as easily on the total of \u00a310m spent to buy Jonathan Macken, David Sommeil and Christian N\u00e9gouai. Though there is plenty of hostility to spare for the recruitment of Steve McManaman, the thwarting of Keegan's dreams and schemes should not only be regretted by the bookkeepers. Club football in England was in his debt when the manager's verve and optimism were at a peak. The traits, occasionally dormant, are still there in his character and, in the immediate aftermath of defeat, few other managers would be so sportsmanlike, passionate and full of rapt analysis in discussing an opponent as he was while evaluating the Middlesbrough winger Stewart Downing. It is a vastly appealing characteristic and there used to be real rewards for the zeal. His personality, when he entered management as an emergency appointment in 1992, helped Newcastle United slam on the brakes when it looked as if their disastrous momentum was about to send them flying out of the old Second Division. Thereafter, Keegan fostered an inspirational inclusiveness, bringing in entertaining players to St James' Park and drawing crowds who lingered outside the ground hours before kick-off. Whatever his limitations, that magnetism pulled others into the adventurous bid for the Premiership that was more animated than any conducted by his four successors at Newcastle. His engagement was boundless. Another manager would have conducted the sale of Andy Cole at dead of night, but Keegan went straight outside the stadium in broad daylight to debate his decision with the supporters. The populism has since waned as disappointments have made Keegan wary, but his flair for communication is still considerable when he chooses to exercise it. His showmanship can be sneered at as camouflage for a lack of expertise in his profession. He encouraged the critics by admitting that he decided to resign as England manager after realising that he did not quite know what to do to alter a match that Germany were winning. Michael Owen, in his autobiography, is also damning of Keegan's approach during Euro 2000. For all that, the manager has sought to adapt. Even if he will never be a painstaking coach, City are better in defence nowadays. A man who abolished the reserve team at Newcastle has also reconsidered his attitude and fostered young talent in Manchester by promoting Bradley Wright-Phillips to join his brother Shaun, as well as Willo Flood. It is the times that are against Keegan as his days in management run down. He always was a touch too impulsive and now he is fighting against rivals who are more cold-bloodedly meticulous than ever. If this lively man who was so quick to feel the excitement of the game and impart it to others is really to depart, though, then some of football's spontaneity will quit with him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
