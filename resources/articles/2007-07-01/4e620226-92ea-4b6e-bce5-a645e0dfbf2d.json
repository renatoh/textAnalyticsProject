While you're descending on the US and snapping up iPods and cheap Marlboros, we're in your country splitting single servings of cod and chips four ways and taking turns sipping from one precious can of Fanta. I contemplate this monetary inequity as I prepare my family for a year in Oxford. Whenever I tell someone that we're moving to England, I get the same sympathetic response: take lots of money. Well, of course we will. But American money isn't much good, is it? That's the problem. There may be a certain symmetry in a dollar being worth almost exactly half a pound - and as someone who majored in English in college, I appreciate the simplicity of the fiscal equations I must now perform - but I think I'd welcome the opportunity to learn how to multiply things by, say, 1.4 or 1.5. Jesus, I'd even take 1.8. But that is apparently not to be, and so our challenge will be to scrimp and save during the year we'll spend in the UK. I've already told my family that we'll all be wearing disposable nappies. It's true that my original rationale involved vague misgivings about English plumbing, but I think by diapering up we can experience real savings on the water bill. This will also have the benefit of really getting us our money's worth on the council tax. If I'm going to be forking out hundreds of pounds a month to the council for rubbish disposal, I'm darn well going to make them earn it. Heat will be another precious commodity. I envision a single electric fire set to \"chilly\". We will carry it from room to room. And light. If some species of nocturnal rodents are able to evolve huge eyes from lives lived in near total darkness, who's to say the same can't happen with us? Then there's food. If you've ever been to the US you know that we could all of us do with losing a few pounds. Here is our chance: the Strong Pound/Weak Dollar Diet. Scurvy might be a problem, but most Americans have too many teeth in their heads anyway. Luxuries are obviously out. We won't be getting a car. We will learn to cut each other's hair and set each other's compound fractures. I will also be looking to sell my blood. You do have eBay in England, right? In fact, this is the perfect opportunity to become entrepreneurial. What can I smuggle from the US to sell on the streets of Oxford? Razor blades? Nylons? Chocolates? Or is this what I'll be barking at my two teenage daughters a few hours before our flight leaves for Heathrow: \"C'mon girls, swallow these heroin-filled condoms or it's going to be a grim Christmas\"? Of course! Petrol. Now there's a commodity that's nice and cheap in the States. Not as cheap as it once was (thanks, Dubya), but still a bargain compared to what you poor sods have to pay. If only I had a hollow leg I could fill with the precious fuel. We'll survive somehow. It's not like we're moving to England for ever. And I've always liked those quintessentially American stories of immigrant reinvention. In a year I'll be able to say, \"I came to the United States with only five dollars in my pocket\". I guess what I'm saying is, you know how there's always one fellow at the pub who never seems to buy a round, a guy who's quite happy to raise a glass that's been purchased by someone else but who shrinks into the shadows when it's his turn? Well, for a year or so, that guy's going to be me. \u00b7 John Kelly is a columnist for the Washington Post.
