Richard England's knotty, tricky doc strives to give the movement context through the story of the Cockney Rejects' Jeff and Micky Geggus, who exploded out of a cramped Canning Town semi in the late 1970s with a tape recorder full of \"four-bar shitter songs\", and came to provide the soundtrack for West Ham's hooligan element. The Gegguses could, you suspect, talk all day: even their lighter showbiz anecdotes \u2013 flattening Steve Wright, terrorising Legs &amp; Co \u2013 have a revealing edge, yet this band of boneheads still drew the line at swastikas. \"We bashed a few people, but fuck 'em,\" is the unrepentant conclusion: its subjects' defiant gobbiness \u2013 and the participation of several variously nostalgic ex-hooligans \u2013 is problematic, but the film amply describes the unfocused rage that can fester in deprived communities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
