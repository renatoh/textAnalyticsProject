Of the hundreds of luminaries interrogated by dapper GQ editor Dylan Jones during his distinguished career, they are the only three to insist on taping the interview for their records. Jones doesn't feel the need to place his own tape recorder on his desk to guard against being misquoted, but he has much to say about producing a monthly glossy 'for yuppies' (his words), and on the rather more obscure subject of magazine distribution. His office is overflowing with mementos, including a letter from Sir Paul McCartney and a photo of himself and Cond\u00e9 Nast managing director Nicholas Coleridge with a smiling David Bowie. Such are the trappings of a career which allows you to 'meet your idols'. Every job has its more mundane side, however, and Jones has temporarily descended from the dizzy heights of fashion shoots and celebrity interviews to the unfamiliar terrain of government competition policy. In a draft ruling earlier this year, the Office of Fair Trading found that the distribution of magazines, which is currently handled by a series of local monopolies, is uncompetitive. The decision is not final, but a consultation period ends on Friday and the existing system could be dismantled next year. 'It is a boring subject, but potentially very damaging to the industry,' Jones says. The industry argues that the arrangement, under which contracts are awarded to a single distributor in each area of the country, allows distributors to meet the cost of delivering smaller titles to more remote regions. 'At the moment, anywhere in the country you're at most five miles away from being able to buy any newspaper or magazine,' Jones says. 'That could change.' The OFT insists retailers should be free to choose which distributor they use, and that greater competition will lower prices, but Jones claims it has been unwilling to hold discussions. He has been lobbying the OFT, and the government, in his capacity as president of the British Society of Magazine Editors, working with another industry body, the Periodical Publishers' Association, to bring the issue to the attention of the Prime Minister. Blair was ambushed at a glitzy Number 10 reception earlier this year, and promised to look into the matter, although it is unlikely to be at top of his in-tray. 'We have started lobbying the government because the OFT is not entering into a debate,' Jones says. 'They have refused to allow us to brief them. No one can quite understand why they're being so intransigent. From what I can gather, the government is getting increasingly frustrated because it thinks this is a poor [proposal].' The next step is to form an alliance with newspaper owners, who were exempted from the OFT ruling but may have much to lose if the system is dismantled. 'At the moment, newspapers and magazines are bundled together by wholesalers. If you don't have that it's going to cost twice as much to deliver newspapers,' Jones claims. 'The reason we're kicking up such a fuss is because when it happened in America, 32,000 local newsagents went out of business. If this is put into practice over here, more than 50,000 newsagents could vanish.' There is something surreal about the sight of GQ riding to the rescue of the local corner shop and the publisher of Cabinet Maker, but Jones has become an articulate industry spokesman in recent years. He has edited GQ, current circulation 120,000, since 1999, arriving from Arena to replace James Brown. With his tailored suits and dandy attire, Jones is an easy target for critics who carp that GQ is all style and no substance, but those that do so ignore the quality of its journalism. Jones has slowly assembled a stable of star writers who are unlikely to grace the pages of any other glossy. Boris Johnson is the motoring correspondent; Dominic Lawson and AA Gill write regularly; and the latest signing, former Mirror editor Piers Morgan, starts a monthly interview slot in the September issue. His first subject is Australian cricket legend Shane Warne. 'One of the funniest things I've ever read,' according to Jones. 'I would hope that this is first port of call for writers of a certain calibre. Newspapers have aped magazine culture, kick-started brilliantly by the Sunday Times when it turned itself into a multi-section newspaper. [Now] we are going into the newspaper world and cherry picking very, very good writers.' GQ's circulation has risen steadily over the past year, although Jones modestly attributes this to the launch of weekly 'lads mags' Nuts and Zoo, which have hit sales of their monthly sister publications - FHM, Loaded and Maxim. 'The last thing I want to do is disparage the competition, but I think our growth has been helped by the fact that the weeklies have cannibalised the mass market,' Jones says. GQ, along with National Magazines' Esquire, stand loftily above the 'lads mag' fray, catering for successful, aspirational men with money to spend. 'We were metrosexual before the word was invented. A magazine like GQ is never going to sell in the kind of numbers that an FHM or a Loaded once did. It's chalk and cheese. It's a bit like comparing the Telegraph with the Mirror. Our end of the market is basically us and Esquire and we are in the lucky position of selling twice as many as Esquire.' Both make liberal use of scantily clad females to sell magazines, but Jones sees no reason to apologise for that. 'Fine writing and sexy women ... are not mutually exclusive. We are a men's magazine, we have a very strong heterosexual libido. I don't see why that has to be either tacky or anodyne.' The minutiae of the magazine distribution system, on the other hand, is far less sexy. 'As my old publisher used to say, its better than selling photocopiers in Birmingham,' Jones replies, perhaps not the best anecdote to relate to a Birmingham-born interviewer. 'I've fucked it now haven't I?' Jones says when he realises his faux pas. Even the editor of GQ allows his veneer to slip occasionally."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
