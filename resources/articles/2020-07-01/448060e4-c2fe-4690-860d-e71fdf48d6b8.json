After the meeting on Wednesday, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador lauded Donald Trump in Spanish for showing \u201crespect\u201d to Mexico and \u201cnot treating us like a colony\u201d. The comments caused some back home to cringe. Critics say that L\u00f3pez Obrador, popularly known as Amlo, has meekly agreed to US demands to step up migration enforcement, and accepted Trump\u2019s policy of sending asylum seekers to await their hearings in Mexico. But Amlo also won praise for voicing support for Mexican migrants in the US \u2013 and escaping relatively unscathed from his encounter with Trump. Trump showed \u201can unusual courtesy to his peer\u201d and \u201c@lopezobrador gave a speech of historic, political and diplomatic depth as the representative of a free, dignified, democratic and sovereign country,\u201d tweeted \u00c1lvaro Delgado G\u00f3mez, columnist with the newspaper El Heraldo de M\u00e9xico. Mostly, however, Amlo won plaudits for simply avoiding humiliation. \u201cTrump surprised us in a good way: he behaved,\u201d said Carlos Bravo Regidor, a political analyst. \u201cHe didn\u2019t score any goals against Amlo. It was Amlo who scored an own goal, when he talked about \u2018respect\u2019 and \u2018understanding\u2019. That was unnecessary and excessive, and provided the fodder Trump\u2019s campaign was looking for electorally.\u201d The visit underscored the surprisingly warm personal relations between the austere Mexican and his US counterpart. \u201cThe predictions were wrong,\u201d Amlo told reporters. \u201cWe didn\u2019t fight. We\u2019re friends, and will continue to be friends.\u201d Reactions to the trip reflected Mexico\u2019s own political polarization. A pre-trip poll published by the newspaper El Financiero showed 59% support for travelling to Washington, though 85% of Mexicans disapproved of Trump. Amlo remains relatively popular \u2013 despite polls showing worries over his handling of issues like crime, the economy and the Covid-19 pandemic. Observers say Amlo supporters were simply backing the president on the Washington trip rather than expressing an opinion on the propriety of visiting Trump. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t evaluating the impact of the trip itself, rather the president\u2019s decision to go to Washington,\u201d said Carlos Heredia, professor at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics. \u201cIf our president wanted to go to Mars, there would be majority support without discussing why he needed to go.\u201d The trip to Washington was already something of a paradox: a celebration of North American free trade by two protectionists, and a Mexican leader who rails against \u201cneoliberalism\u201d praising billionaires for their \u201csocial concern\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s strange to hear the 1970s anti-imperial left squarely defend Trump,\u201d tweeted Jos\u00e9 Antonio Crespo, a historian and political analyst, who noted that the Mexican left would routinely criticize previous presidents as \u201cservile\u201d for their eagerness to remain on good terms with the US. North of the border, Democrats blasted the visit as unnecessarily helping Trump\u2019s re-election. Joe Biden tweeted: \u201cTrump launched his 2016 campaign by calling Mexicans rapists \u2026 We need to work in partnership with Mexico. We need to restore dignity and humanity to our immigration system.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign was quick to produce videos of Trump welcoming Amlo to the White House and spread them on social media \u2013 something that didn\u2019t go unnoticed in Mexico. \u201cTrump has capitalised on this according to script. And he\u2019ll continue doing so until election day,\u201d Heredia said. \u201cIf voters say, \u2018you\u2019re a racist,\u2019 he can now answer, \u2018Look, I have the president of Mexico at my side \u2026 If I were a racist, he wouldn\u2019t be here.\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
