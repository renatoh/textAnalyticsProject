Over the past five years, examiners have failed more than two-thirds of drivers who took their test in the highly congested area of Wanstead , which features the A12 trunk road and a series of complicated roundabouts. In the quieter towns of Barrow-in-Furness and Whitby, North Yorkshire, taking the test is a comparative doddle. Just a third of new drivers taking their test there failed. Privilege car insurance analysed five years of Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) data and revealed a huge disparity in pass rates around the country. Drivers in the Belvedere area of south-east Londontake their tests on the UK\u2019s second-most challenging roads. It\u2019s a similar story in Wood Green, on London\u2019s busy north circular road, and South Yardley and Kingstanding in Birmingham. Drivers in Leeds, Bradford and Salford also had fail rates above 60%. The figures suggest those who repeatedly fail their test in a city should consider heading to remoter parts of the country, where two-thirds of new drivers are coming away from the test with a pass \u2013 apparently aided by a much easier test route. Neil Beeson, Privilege\u2019s driving test expert, said the disparity in pass rates was mostly the result of higher traffic volume and more roundabouts in city areas. \u201cWanstead\u2019s driving test routes incorporate up to four major roundabouts, including the Redbridge roundabout, which is particularly problematic due to multi-lanes and heavy traffic flow. Getting into the correct lane is a problem for lots of drivers and this can cause even bigger issues for learners,\u201d he said. \u201cBy contrast, Barrow-in-Furness is a much quieter test area. Although it is still in a town, the traffic is less heavy, making the driving more predictable, or at least less affected by the actions of other drivers.\u201d The insurer also looked into the most common reasons for failing a driving test. A freedom of information request revealed lack of observation at junctions was the number one cause, closely followed by not checking mirrors enough. Turning right at junctions also continues to be a problem for new drivers, the information showed. The DVSA\u2019s chief examiner, Lesley Young, said: \u201cAll candidates are assessed to the same level and the result of their test is entirely dependent on their performance on the day. It\u2019s essential that all drivers demonstrate they have the right skills, knowledge and attitude to drive safely.\u201d Earlier this month the DVSA announced it wanted to update the driving test to make it better to reflect real-life driving. Proposals include making learners drive into and reverse out of a parking space and show they are able to follow satnav directions.
