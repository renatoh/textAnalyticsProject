The excitement around the Henry programme (Health, Exercise, Nutrition for the Really Young) in Leeds, which claimed to have reduced childhood obesity by helping parents give children choices while maintaining boundaries, shows how seductive this narrative can be (and it should be noted that there is a lively debate in the British Medical Journal about exactly what the programme achieved). Now the Centre for Progressive Policy (CPP) has published a major study, Beyond the NHS - addressing the root causes of poor health, which examines how everything from crime to education lie at the heart of our serious and growing health inequalities. Launched at the House of Commons with public health expert Sir Michael Marmot a decade after his landmark review, its analysis indicates that the current population of England will lose around 80 million life years through socio-economic inequality, which will also take another 170 million years of healthy life. This is based on the assumption that everyone could live as long and as well as those in the least economically deprived areas. It averages out at 1.5 years of life and 3.2 years of healthy life lost per person. Of the 80 million years of life lost, 30 million are attributed to differences in education, 18 million to disposable income, 15 million to employment, and eight million each to crime and housing. The fact that life expectancy improvements have stalled for the first time in over a century \u2013 barring flu pandemics and world wars \u2013 shows a serious structural problem is emerging. The infamous gaps in life expectancy between the poorest and wealthiest parts of the country are edging upwards. Data from the Department of Health and Social Care reveals the shocking detail of how people die sooner in deprived areas, with widening gaps in recent years for infant mortality and under-75 deaths from cardiovascular disease and cancer. The CPP report reveals how most of the differences in life expectancy are explained by five social factors: education, employment, income, crime and housing. By some margin, differences in educational opportunities have the most extreme effect, reducing life expectancy in Great Yarmouth by 1.8 years, and 1.7 years in Fenland, Hull, Boston and Stoke-on-Trent. Hull loses roughly another year through poor employment, similar to Birmingham and Middlesbrough. Residents in five London boroughs \u2013 Lambeth, Newham, Barking and Dagenham, Islington and Waltham Forest \u2013 lose an average of half a year each through crime. The impact of poor housing is most readily seen in rural areas such as Cornwall, West Devon and West Somerset. But the situation is not hopeless, if only there was the political will. CPP analysis of 35 OECD countries over the past 40 years shows that those which are invested in education and social protection beyond healthcare improved their life expectancy. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 analysis of the impact of the Sure Start programme for parents of young children demonstrates, ambitious social support can have an impact, in this case large cuts in children in deprived areas being hospitalised, driven by everything from fewer falls to better immunity from diseases. But Sure Start funding has been cut by two-thirds, and its success should not distract from tackling the bedrock of life opportunities such as education and housing. Legislation such as the 2012 NHS reforms dabbles in health inequalities, but to negligible effect. There are ongoing attempts to improve access to healthcare in deprived areas, but this is not the same as tackling the root causes. The NHS long-term plan, published in January, addresses the symptoms but desperately needs a matching programme of social action. The CPP report drags the debate on health inequalities back to the hard facts. While healthy living advice is essential, we are never going to tackle the differences in longevity and healthy life expectancy one uneaten burger at a time. With all the current talk of uniting the country, giving everyone a chance to live a long and healthy life would be a good place to start. \u2022 Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
