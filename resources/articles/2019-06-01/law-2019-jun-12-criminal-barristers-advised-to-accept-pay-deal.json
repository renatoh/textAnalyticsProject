The Criminal Bar Association, which represents thousands of prosecutors and defence lawyers, claimed the government\u2019s promised increase amounted to tens of millions of pounds. It was not clear whether there would be new money from outside existing, stretched budgets. The CBA received overwhelming support from its 3,000-strong membership for a day of action on 1 July that would have in effect closed down the criminal courts for a day. But a joint statement issued by the the Crown Prosecution Service, Ministry of Justice, attorney general, Criminal Bar Association and the Bar Council on Wednesday announced that an agreement had been reached. The deal will be put to CBA members, asking whether they want to call off the walkout. Chris Henley QC, the CBA chair, said: \u201cWe welcome the government\u2019s commitment to deal immediately and comprehensively with historic deficiencies in remuneration levels for prosecution advocacy and fee payment guidance for a wide range of routine situations, and for standard fees generally.\u201d Under the deal standard courtroom appearance fees are expected to rise from \u00a346.50 to \u00a390. Having just agreed to give high court judges a rise of 27% over two years, the MoJ is finding it difficult to defend the need for imposing continuing austerity on other lawyers. The director of public prosecutions, Max Hill QC, said: \u201cWe are committed to introducing a fees scheme that gives a fair deal for prosecution advocates, and is affordable and sustainable. The external bar plays a vital role in the prosecution team, and it is right that all advocates are properly remunerated for their hard work.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe work of the entire criminal legal profession, whether prosecuting for the crown or defending those who are innocent until proven guilty, is fundamental to upholding criminal justice, and the rule of law. \u201cToday, the government, through engagement with representatives of the legal profession, continues to demonstrate our shared commitment to improving that criminal justice system, which depends on the hard work of criminal barristers, solicitors and other professionals across England and Wales.\u201d The president of the Law Society of England and Wales, Christina Blacklaws, welcomed the deal, saying \u201cit is encouraging that slowly but surely, the government is recognising the damage done by underfunding the criminal justice system\u201d. She added: \u201cBut defence solicitors will understandably be wondering how much more of an existential crisis they have to face before the government addresses the underfunding they are facing. \u201cGood firms are collapsing. Young lawyers are rejecting this area of law. In parts of the country, the criminal defence solicitor is going extinct, and the possibility of a fair trial is critically endangered. The evidence of the damage being done is overwhelming.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
