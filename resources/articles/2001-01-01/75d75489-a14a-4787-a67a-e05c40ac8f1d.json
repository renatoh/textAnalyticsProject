While the rest of the world was still bleary-eyed with New Year hangovers, news arrived of financial problems at his label, swiftly followed by an announcement from New York house Tse that they would not be renewing his design contract. Chalayan went to ground, but this week has reappeared in the most unlikely of places - M&amp;S. Life, as Ronan Keating so aptly put it, is a rollercoaster, just gotta ride it. The high street superpower has announced that Chalayan is the latest signing to its club class Autograph range: the new collection features the designer's signature understated-yet-sculptural looks in the draped separates and \"waterfall\" georgette evening dress. Wear your support for one of London's unique fashion talents on your sleeve (or back or legs) from \u00a355 for a camisole, \u00a3120 for a dress."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
