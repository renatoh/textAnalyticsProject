In a judgement delivered on Tuesday, Justice Mordecai Bromberg found in favour of the refugee, whose lawyers had claimed the department secretary, Mike Pezzullo, had refused to notify the minister of the man\u2019s application for a medical transfer, which would commence the process. Bromberg ordered the minister for home affairs, Peter Dutton, be notified as soon as practicable that the man is to be assessed for transfer. Bromberg\u2019s judgement appears to set an important precedent, ruling that a doctor\u2019s assessment of a medical file without assessing the individual either in person or via teleconference is acceptable under the law. Under the medevac legislation passed earlier this year, a refugee seeking transfer to Australia for medical or psychiatric care is required to provide written assessments from two treating doctors to the department secretary. \u201cAfter being notified by the secretary that a person is a relevant transitory person, the minister must approve, or refuse to approve, the person\u2019s transfer to Australia,\u201d the law reads. If the minister refuses on medical \u2013 rather than national security \u2013 grounds, the case goes to an independent medical panel for review. However, lawyers for the Iraqi man, referred to as CCA19, said the secretary had \u201crefused\u201d to notify the minister \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d, and successfully petitioned the federal court to compel him. It was not disputed that the two physicians \u2013 Dr Alvaro Manovel and Dr Michael Dudley \u2013 were accepted as having the ability to provide assessments. Both Manovel and Dudley had determined CCA19 was not getting appropriate medical or psychiatric treatment on Nauru, which he required, and it was necessary to remove him from Nauru. Neither doctor personally interviewed or examined CCA19, but it was not clear from the judgement if this was related to the Nauru government\u2019s ban on unapproved telemedicine. Pezzullo\u2019s lawyers argued to the court that the assessments were not valid under the act \u201cbecause of the absence (in each case) of any personal interaction or engagement with the applicant in the conduct of the assessment\u201d, the judgement said. Bromberg said CCA19 had interpreted the act\u2019s phrase \u201cremotely or in person\u201d to mean the assessment could occur in person or not, and that an assessment of medical files \u201csquarely fell within the language of the provision as an assessment conducted \u2018remotely\u2019\u201d. \u201cOn the respondent\u2019s construction, the provision is to be understood as if it said: has assessed the transitory person in person or as though in person but remotely,\u201d said Bromberg. However, he determined Pezzullo\u2019s construction did \u201cnot withstand scrutiny\u201d and was based on a fundamental assumption about the intentions of parliament in passing the law, and which had not been established. Bromberg said he also \u201csubstantially overstate[d] the inherent importance of personal engagement in the conduct of a medical assessment\u201d and that to do so ran counter to the beneficial aims of the medevac law. \u201cTransitory persons for whom personal engagement with a \u201ctreating doctor\u201d is not possible or not practicable would be excluded at the starting gate,\u201d he said. Once Dutton is notified of CCA19\u2019s required transfer he will have 72 hours to make a decision. The Coalition has pledged to repeal the medevac law, which has so far seen 30 people brought to Australia for care. Labor maintains it won\u2019t support a repeal but has not ruled out supporting amendments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
