He had the square jaw, the perfect smile and, walking beside him, his gorgeous blonde wife, Ann. He also had a speech that read like a horror movie and described an America in mortal peril of bankruptcy and social chaos. \"If we keep spending like we are spending and borrowing like we are borrowing, at some point we can face what Greece faces,\" he told a room that was packed to overflowing. But Romney does not just look the part of president. In the race to be the Republicans' 2012 nominee, and challenge Barack Obama for the White House, Romney is riding high. And with Obama facing the challenge of a worsening economy and anaemic approval ratings, a growing number of commentators believe that the former governor of Massachusetts could be the next occupant of the Oval Office. He is the undoubted frontrunner in the Republican race, with the rest of the field scrabbling to be the sole \"anti-Romney\" candidate. One by one, Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry looked likely contenders before their bubbles burst and support withered. Now the latest anti-Romney candidate, former pizza magnate Herman Cain, is mired in a sexual harassment scandal. With less than two months until Iowa and New Hampshire kick off the vital early contests, Romney is sitting pretty. More than a few of those 200 people inside the hall felt they just might be looking at their nominee: their great hope of making Obama a one-term president. \"He has the money. He has the experience. Romney is the most well-rounded candidate,\" said Rene Bonnin, 63, a local retired naval worker. The 2011 version of Romney appears different to the man who failed to win the 2008 nomination. That Romney, whose team resurrected the unflattering nickname from his business days of \"Sweaty Armpit Mitt\", was a ditherer, uncertain and overly cautious. This Romney, while hardly the greatest politician of his day, is forceful, calm and heading a campaign that has shown quiet ruthlessness. His stump speech is a carefully crafted piece of work designed to scare more than inspire, but in America's current Age of Anxiety that is more than enough to sound effective. He acknowledges the struggles of America's middle class, the increasing rates of poverty and high unemployment. America is threatened, he says, and only he can stop it. \"The concept of America needing a bailout is hard to think about. There is no nation big enough to save us,\" he told the Exeter crowd. Romney's campaign is based around his experience in the private sector and how he turned around Salt Lake City's Winter Olympics bid. He has coupled this with a vehement anti-government agenda designed to appeal to the Tea Party activists who drove the party to victory in the 2010 midterm elections. In Exeter, he vowed to slash federal government by 10%, reduce foreign aid and end Obama's healthcare reforms. But, in such company as Bachmann, Cain and Perry, anti-government sentiments are common. What has made Romney so formidable is that \u2013 unlike his primary foes \u2013 he has been through this process before. What few scandals lie in Romney's past, such as once hiring a gardening firm that employed illegal immigrants, are old news. Romney's secret strength is that he has made no headlines. \"He's been thoroughly vetted and other candidates have not,\" said Steve Mitchell, chairman of Republican polling firm Mitchell Research. But Romney's path still has obstacles. Many conservatives distrust him. Ryan Rhodes, founder of an Iowa Tea Party group, said: \"Mitt Romney is still the east coast liberal he has always been. I am not going to campaign for him.\" His other problem is with the religious right. Many there distrust Romney's Mormon religion, seeing it as outside the bounds of mainstream Christian theology. Overall, this explains why Romney's support in national Republican polls rarely tops 25%. \"A lot of people out there can't make up their minds about him yet,\" said Patrick Griffin, a political consultant to numerous Republican campaigns and now an expert at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St Anselm's College. But there is one thing nearly all Republicans agree on: what will be the main issue in the coming contest with Obama. \"The economy,\" said Scott Filiauld, a 46-year-old owner of a local software firm. Even in Exeter, with its quaint main street lined with antique shops and prosperous-looking homes, the times are tough, with little optimism of a recovery any time soon. The economic facts do indeed paint a grim picture. Unemployment is stubbornly stuck around 9%. The number of Americans living in poverty is put at a staggering 46 million. Worst of all, the US could easily double-dip back into recession. Romney, like other Republicans, puts the blame on the vast American deficit and government spending. Obama pins the blame on previous governments deregulating Wall Street and the actions of big banks. But the unwritten rule of American politics is that the president is responsible for the state of the economy: good or bad, fairly or unfairly. \"If you are the White House and looking at this economy, then you can't be happy,\" said Mitchell. Obama also faces a highly motivated and angry Republican base, coupled with a disenchanted wing of his own party. Current polls reveal the extent of his task. A CBS poll found that only 21% of Americans thought the country was going in the right direction. A survey from Quinnipiac University in Connecticut showed that 54% of respondents thought Obama did not deserve a second term. In a Gallup poll, Romney tied Obama on 47% nationally and was 1% up in swing states. One key thing to emerge from that last poll was that Romney was a better performer against Obama than Perry or Cain. \"Romney is not every Republican's first choice but he is going to be an acceptable choice,\" said Griffin. The very things that can hurt Romney in this primary \u2013 his moderate policies as governor of Massachusetts \u2013 could help in a presidential election where it will be hard to paint him as an extremist. Romney is already the subject of Democratic attack ads seeking to paint him as uncaring and too pro-Wall Street. But to many experts that only shows how much they fear him. After Romney's speech in Exeter, former New Hampshire governor John Sununu urged the crowd to spread the word about the candidate. \"Mitt Romney is the man this country needs to be the next president,\" he said. Then, as people rushed forward to grab autographs, the man who would be president tried to leave. It took him a full 20 minutes to get to a door just 10 paces away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
