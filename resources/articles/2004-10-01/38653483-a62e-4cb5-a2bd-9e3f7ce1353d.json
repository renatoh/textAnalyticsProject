The lawsuit says vast amounts spent on advertising and marketing persuaded pensioners to buy Nexium when they could have saved money by buying Prilosec. The view that Nexium is no better, or little better than Prilosec, is commonly held in the industry. The active ingredient in the two drugs, called esomeprazole and omeprazole respectively, are almost identical. The suit, brought by American groups the Congress of California Seniors and California Alliance for Retired Americans, calls for the return of all profits from the sale of Nexium. High drug prices in the US are a hot political issue and the industry is nervous about any price controls being imposed because the country provides most of its profits. Prilosec, \"the purple pill\", was once the best-selling drug in the world, with revenues of about $6bn (\u00a33.3bn) a year. This was a large part of AZ's revenue, so when the company faced losing its right to produce it exclusively at a high price in 2000, it was a major issue for the firm. When a company brings a drug to market it can do so exclusively for a set period, but after it loses its patent, generic drug firms can muscle in. While the drug is in patent the company charges much more than the manufacturing cost to recoup its spending on research and clinical trials, but the price falls when competition is introduced. The suit describes the firm's strategy to reduce the impact, dubbed the shark's fin project because of the shape the sales graph would be if the firm could not find a way to mitigate the loss of Prilosec sales. It says AZ bombarded doctors with promotional material and used \"flawed\" clinical trial results to promote the drug to patients with an unusually large advertising and marketing campaign, stating that Nexium was better than Prilosec. This has been successful and Nexium had sales of $3.3bn last year. The lawsuit quotes the price of Nexium at $4 a pill now, against Prilosec's 46 cents. According to research firm Wood Mackenzie, last year AZ spent $257m on advertising Nexium, more than on any other drug. \"There are clearly differences with Nexium and Prilosec: Nexium has demonstrated better acid control and better healing of acid-related damage,\" said a spokesman for AZ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
