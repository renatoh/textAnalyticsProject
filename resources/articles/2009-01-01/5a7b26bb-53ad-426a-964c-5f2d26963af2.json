The Tottenham Hotspur manager cannot wait to unleash the Honduras international in central midfield and he will hand him his debut at Bolton Wanderers on Saturday. But Redknapp wonders where he can play Luka Modric, who starred in the middle of the pitch in the 3-1 home win over Stoke City on Tuesday, given that he feels he also needs Didier Zokora in central midfield and that Jermain Defoe, his \u00a315m signing from Portsmouth, cannot play up front on his own. \"I'd have to adjust the formation really [to get Palacios in],\" said Redknapp, \"because he is a central midfielder and I need Zokora as well. Zokora did a good job defensively against Stoke, he sat in there and let Luka play so between the three of them and I've got [Jermaine] Jenas coming back [from a calf injury] ... I'm strong in midfield and I have some good options. With Defoe, I don't see him as being a front man, not on his own.\" Redknapp continues to cast around for a new striker, presumably to partner Defoe, having missed out on Craig Bellamy and Kenwyne Jones, among others. He retains an interest in Liverpool's Robbie Keane and Fred, the Brazilian at Lyon, although he has balked at the French club's valuation of \u00a45m (\u00a34.61m). Redknapp knows that Spurs are the only European club to show an interest in Fred and that the player, who is out of contract in the summer, has fallen so far out of favour that he is unlikely to feature for Lyon again. The combination of factors means that Lyon are hardly in a strong position to demand their valuation. Tottenham may return before the close of the transfer window next Monday to tie up a deal until the end of the season. The pursuit of Keane is intriguing, given that he never managed to forge a productive partnership with Defoe. Tottenham have approached Liverpool to see if a deal can be struck and they have even suggested players as makeweights. But Keane is determined to stay and prove his worth at Anfield. One formation open to Redknapp that would permit Defoe a strike partner and include Palacios, Modric and Zokora in central midfield would be 3-5-2. Pascal Chimbonda, who has arrived back from Sunderland, would appear well suited to the right wing-back role with Gareth Bale on the left. But if Redknapp sticks with a back four, Modric's starting position may be on the left of midfield. Zokora has been a virtually ever present for the last two months. Redknapp added that Aaron Lennon was doubtful for the Bolton game. \"I've got to try and balance the team up now,\" said Redknapp. \"I need to get Palacios in because he is everything I've been wanting. I've got to shape a team up where I get those people in my team.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
