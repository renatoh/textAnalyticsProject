He is a man desperate to get out of combat duty, who finds himself trapped in a bureaucratic nightmare. Disappointingly, director and producer George Clooney seems miscast in the role of Lieutenant Scheisskopf. Mike Bradley Philip Green &amp; the Trouble With Topshop 10pm, Channel 5 Having sold a crumbling BHS to a former bankrupt, which led to the loss of 11,000 jobs and left a pension deficit assessed at \u00a3571m (a situation later rectified after intervention from the Pensions Regulator), Philip Green had already lost his crown as king of the UK high street. Then came the allegations of abuse against his staff, and financial woes for the remaining stores in his Arcadia empire. Fiona Phillips reports. Hannah J Davies George Clarke\u2019s Old House, New Home 8pm, Channel 4 A return for the show in which Clarke helps homeowners get rid of the awful decor previous occupants left behind in the mistaken belief it was in any way acceptable.

Ali Catterall Who Should Get to Stay in the UK? 9pm, BBC Two Three more cases for lawyers fighting to help people to stay in the UK, in a series that underlines what a tragic waste of energy the \u201chostile environment\u201d is. Even this week\u2019s big victory, given the obstacles overcome to achieve it, only emphasises the wider injustice. Jack Seale Sewermen 9pm, 5Spike The first in a grim but insightful series about the challenges faced by staff at United Utilities, one of the UK\u2019s biggest water companies, who battle \u201cunflushables\u201d, bursts and 100-tonne fatbergs, at the same time as constructing one of Britain\u2019s biggest new fresh water pipelines. Who knew dealing with \u201ca tankful of turds\u201d could be so fascinating? MB The Other Two 10pm, E4 It really is a family affair this week in this wry comedy as \u201cCare Bear\u201d Cary feebly pumps iron in preparation for a dire TV chatshow also scheduled to feature mum Pat. Chase is exercising, too, for a new music video, while Brooke confronts her past as a professional dancer. MB Film choice The Stranger (Orson Welles, 1946) 3.40am, Talking Pictures TV After The Magnificent Ambersons, this is Orson Welles in a more conventional, studio-pleasing guise. The war has ended and Nazi Franz Kindler (Welles) is hiding out in a Connecticut town, posing as the spouse of an innocent Loretta Young. But war crimes investigator Edward G Robinson is on the trail. Paul Howlett Sport choice Tennis: Queen\u2019s 1pm, BBC Two. The concluding second-round singles matches. Rugby league: London Broncos v Hull Kingston Rovers 7pm, Sky Sports Main Event. Super league clash between two struggling sides. Women\u2019s World Cup football: Sweden v USA 7.45pm, BBC Four.
