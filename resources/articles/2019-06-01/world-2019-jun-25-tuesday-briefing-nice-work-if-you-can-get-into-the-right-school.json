Members of the uppermost echelons of British politics, the judiciary, media and business are five times more likely to have been to private school than the general population. Privately educated people, many of whom went to Oxbridge, continue to dominate high-ranking jobs: 39% had an independent education compared with 7% of the general population, according to a study called Elitist Britain 2019 by the Sutton Trust and Social Mobility Commission. The report identifies a \u201cpipeline\u201d from fee-paying schools through Oxbridge and into top jobs. Luke Heselwood from the Reform thinktank says the \u201cscandalous\u201d figures show that the UK is far from being a meritocracy. \u201cFixing this will require serious reform to the education system as, despite improvements, the most advantaged are nearly 10 times more likely to attend elite universities than the most disadvantaged.\u201d The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: \u201cThe old boys\u2019 network and the old school tie still hold back talented and hard-working people from less privileged backgrounds.\u201d * * * Love holding me back, says Johnson \u2013 Boris Johnson has set out on a media blitz in which he is vowing never to reveal the events that led to the police being called to the home of his partner Carrie Symonds. The Tory leadership frontrunner insisted on the BBC that \u201cI do not talk about stuff involving my family, my loved ones\u201d because \u201cthat is not fair on them\u201d. Johnson is now understood to be rolling out a \u201cmedia blitz\u201d for the coming days, beginning with a series of closely controlled events on Tuesday. Rival Jeremy Hunt\u2019s camp pointed out that \u201cbottler Boris\u201d has declined all television debates until Conservative members have already begun returning their ballot papers. In a BBC interview, Johnson defended his Brexit plan to renegotiate a deal with the European Union but admitted he could not rip up the entire withdrawal agreement; and said he would tackle the Irish border \u201con the other side of 31 October during what\u2019s called the implementation period\u201d, but then was forced to agree the UK would not get an implementation period without the withdrawal agreement. * * * Sweaty times \u2013 It is going to feel like 47C in parts of Europe as an unprecedented week-long heatwave rolls across the continent. Meteorologists say temperatures will soar from Spain to Switzerland as hot air is sucked up from the Sahara by a storm stalling over the Atlantic and high pressure over central Europe. Officials in Paris have set up \u201ccool rooms\u201d in municipal buildings, opened pools for late-night swimming, installed extra drinking fountains and postponed school exams. Temperatures in the French capital reached 34C on Monday and that\u2019s just the start. France\u2019s deadliest recent heatwave was in August 2003 when almost 15,000 mainly elderly people died as hospitals were overwhelmed. * * * Roof over Archie\u2019s head \u2013 Frogmore Cottage cost the British taxpayer \u00a32.4m to renovate so Harry, Meghan and Archie could live there, accounts reveal. The 18th century Grade-II listed house \u2013 which is actually rather large and uncottagey-looking \u2013 is close to Windsor Castle. The bill included work to convert the five apartments in the building back into one single dwelling, which is now the couple\u2019s official residence since they left Kensington Palace to set up their own royal household. Defective ceiling beams and floor joists need doing, as well as upgrades to the heating, power, gas and water. * * * \u2018Someone knows who she is\u2019 \u2013 A woman posed as the aunt of a cyclist who was killed in London to speak at a meeting against plans for a new segregated bike lane, according to the victim\u2019s mother. Kensington and Chelsea council rejected the scheme. Eilidh Cairns died aged 30 in 2009 after being hit by a tipper truck in the borough. Her sister, Kate Cairns, who founded the road safety charity See Me Save Me after Eilidh\u2019s death said the bike lane scheme, had it been in place, \u201cwould surely have prevented the death of my sister\u201d. Eilidh\u2019s mother, Heather, blasted the \u201ceffrontery\u201d of the mystery person as she demanded the council identify her: \u201cSomeone knows who she is.\u201d The cycle lane plan was drawn up by the office of the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. The borough says it is producing its own plan to direct cyclists to back streets rather than have protected lanes. * * * Down with filth \u2013 The notion that over-cleanliness is bad for children\u2019s health is a dangerous myth, a report from the Royal Society for Public Health has warned. In its survey, 23% of 2,000 people thought \u201chygiene in the home is not important because children need to be exposed to harmful germs to build their immune system\u201d. \u201cThe time has come when we need to sort this one out,\u201d said Sally Bloomfield, lead author of Too Clean or Not Too Clean. \u201cThe public is becoming very confused.\u201d Playing outside in the dirt does children good by exposing them to good bacteria, but it is vital they wash their hands before eating and after going to the toilet, says the RSPH. It stresses the importance of cleaning food preparation surfaces and wash dishcloths, but most crucial is hand washing \u2013 after going to the toilet, being around pets, before and after preparing food, and after coughing, sneezing or nose-blowing. Adults get four to six colds every year, children pick up six to eight, around one in 20 people get the vomiting bug norovirus, and it could all be kept in check by proper hand washing and hygiene, says the RSPH. Today in Focus podcast: Can anything stop Boris Johnson? The Tory leadership hopeful has been avoiding questions on how the police were called to his home after an altercation with his partner. But will questions about Johnson\u2019s previous behaviour and character damage his chances of becoming prime minister? The Guardian\u2019s chief political correspondent, Jessica Elgot, discusses how the incident has been handled by Johnson\u2019s campaign team and the wider questions that have arisen over his judgment and character. And, Bethan McKernan on the mayoral election rerun election in Istanbul that has dealt a serious blow to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Lunchtime read: The new left economics For almost half a century, the left has won progress on how people think about prejudice, personal identity and freedom, exposed capitalism\u2019s cruelties, sometimes won elections, and sometimes governed effectively afterwards. But it has not been able to change fundamentally how wealth and work function in society. The left, in short, has not had an economic policy to answer that of the right: privatisation, deregulation, lower taxes for business and the rich, more power for employers and shareholders, less power for workers. Capitalism has been made to appear inevitable, and any alternative impossible. But in recent years the prevailing system has started to fail. Rather than sustainable and widely shared prosperity, it has produced wage stagnation, ever more workers in poverty, ever more inequality, banking crises, populism and the climate crisis. Even some rightwing politicians concede the seriousness of the crisis. A huge political space has opened up, and a transatlantic movement of leftwing economists is building a practical alternative to neoliberalism. The result, the new economists claim, will be a \u201cdemocratic economy\u201d that suits society, rather than a society subordinated to the economy. Sport Fifa is holding a priority investigation, to be concluded within 48 hours, into the behaviour of the Cameroon team during their 3-0 loss to England in the last 16 of the Women\u2019s World Cup. The hype around the US finally appears to be waning, even as the Americans beat a resilient Spain side 2-1 with the help of two penalties. Stina Blackstenius fired Sweden into the quarter-finals but they needed a penalty save from Hedvig Lindahl to beat Canada 1-0 in Paris. Eoin Morgan has declined to join the chorus of voices asking supporters not to boo Steve Smith and David Warner in today\u2019s World Cup match at Lord\u2019s, adding that the pair may have served bans for last year\u2019s ball-tampering scandal but rebuilding public trust takes longer. If England needed a reminder of just how fragile their hopes of making the semi-finals currently are, the presence of Bangladesh breathing down their neck in the standings following a convincing win against Afghanistan provided it. And the Australian Christian Lobby is hosting a fundraising effort on its website for the former Wallabies star Israel Folau after his GoFundMe page was shut down. Business The digital bank Monzo is being valued at \u00a32bn after a new wave of fundraising attracted \u00a3113m from a group of investors led by Y Combinator, a firm best known for Airbnb, Dropbox and Reddit. The bank has two million users and is aiming to increase that by 50% this year. On the markets, stocks have been down in Asia as investors await the outcome of this weekend\u2019s meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. The FTSE100 is set to drop 0.3% at the opening while the pound is buying $1.275 and \u20ac1.117. The papers The picture of Boris Johnson holding hands with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds features on several front pages today, though many papers express cynicism about the timing and staging of the pic. \u201cWhat a Carrie on\u201d, says the Mirror, while the i has: \u201cJohnson breaks his silence but refuses to discuss his \u2018loved ones\u2019\u201d. The Telegraph writes: \u201cBoris tries to keep the show on the road\u201d and says that while the \u201cpicture paints a thousand words\u201d it \u201craises many more questions\u201d. Other papers don\u2019t feature the picture but still report on the Tory leadership dramas. The Guardian has: \u201cJohnson plans media blitz as Hunt calls him a \u2018bottler\u2019\u201d, the Times says \u201c\u2018Cowardly\u2019 Johnson launches fightback\u201d, the Express reports on Jacob Rees-Mogg coming to Johnson\u2019s defence: \u201cTime to stop the war on Boris\u201d. The Mail features the picture of Johnson and Symonds and a deeply unimpressed headline: \u201cBoris and the Mills &amp; Boon scene that takes us all for fools\u201d, though its main story is \u201cYour \u00a32.4m bill to do up Meghan and Harry\u2019s cottage\u201d. As is the Sun\u2019s: \u201cHarry\u2019s \u00a32.4m home Megover\u201d. Sign up The Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
