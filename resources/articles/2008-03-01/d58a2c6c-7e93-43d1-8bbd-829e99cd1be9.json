The two employees will face charges over the deaths of six-year-old Robert Shepherd and his sister Christianne, seven, in October 2006. The children were poisoned with their father Neil Shepherd, and his girlfriend, Ruth Beatson, both of whom survived. A spokeswoman for the holiday firm said the Greek Judicial Council will also bring charges against a number of other individuals, including hotel management and external maintenance contractors. She said: \"The accident involving Christianne and Robert Shepherd in Corfu was a terrible tragedy and the company's deepest condolences will always be with the children's family and friends. \"There has been an announcement from the Greek Judicial Council that charges will be brought against a number of individuals, including Louis Group hotel management and external maintenance contractors. \"Thomas Cook is shocked and deeply concerned to have been informed that two individuals (who work, or have worked for Thomas Cook) have also been named. \"Thomas Cook continues to stand behind the two people concerned and believes that they will be fully vindicated.\" The company, which always maintained none of its staff would be prosecuted, would not name the two people facing charges. No date for the trial has been set yet. The children, from Wakefield, West Yorks, were on holiday with their father and his partner when the tragedy happened."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
