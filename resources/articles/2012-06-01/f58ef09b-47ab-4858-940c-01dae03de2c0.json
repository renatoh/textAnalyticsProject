The leader of Brent council in north London said they had agreed to sit down with local people who have been campaigning to save Kensal Rise library for more than a year and work with them over their proposal to run it at no ongoing cost to the local authority. The plan is also dependent on an arrangement being reached with All Souls College Oxford, which owns the library. Local campaigners, who have been backed by writers such as Philip Pullman and Zadie Smith, were alerted in the middle of the night this week that Brent council workers were stripping it of books, furniture and other items. The move follows the council's failed attempt to clear the library earlier last month, when they were stopped from removing books by protesters. On Monday morning, between 2am and 3am, when most people were asleep, Brent council sent in a team to remove thousands of books in cardboard boxes. Muhammed Butt, the council's leader, said the decision to remove the books was made before he took over his post in May but that he was determined to establish a new dialogue with the community in Kensal Rise. \"That does not mean I can offer an easy solution. Our libraries have to bear a share of spending cuts, and I make no apology for that. The deep reductions of over \u00a3100m in Brent's budget imposed by this Tory-led government mean we have to make difficult choices about all our services,\" he said. Butt said he had instructed council officers to prepare a package of support to help with the transition of the library into a community-run project, including technical support and funding. The development was welcomed by Dan Jarvis, the shadow culture minister, who added: \"It is not an easy way out \u2013 it puts a good deal of responsibility on the shoulders of the campaigners and there are a number of issues that will need to be worked through before a final agreement can be reached.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
