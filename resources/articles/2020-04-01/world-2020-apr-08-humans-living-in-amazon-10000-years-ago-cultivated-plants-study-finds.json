The team say the new findings from Bolivia offer direct evidence such plants were grown in south-west Amazonia, meaning the region has a claim to join the Middle East, China, south-west Mexico and north-west South America as locations where wild plants were domesticated shortly after the last ice age. The team say the discovery chimes with other clues. \u201c[Previous work] identified south-west Amazonia as a potential centre of domestication because in this area they found a lot of wild relatives of domesticated plants,\u201d said Dr Umberto Lombardo of the University of Bern, a co-author of the research. Writing in the journal Nature, Lombardo and colleagues reveal how they made their discovery after investigating \u201cforest islands\u201d \u2013 raised, wooded areas, about 70 meters in diameter \u2013 within savanna in Llanos de Moxos, Bolivia. Using a range of sources, including Google Earth, the team report more than 6,600 forest islands in Llanos de Moxos, adding that they looked at the makeup of soil samples at 82 of the sites, finding more than 60 showed telltale signs of human occupation \u2013 such as charcoal, shells and bone fragments. From these findings, the team estimated at least 4,700 of the \u201cforest islands\u201d identified were sites where humans once lived \u2013 and chucked their waste. \u201cThey are places where people just threw their rubbish after eating or whatever they did,\u201d said Lombardo, noting the accumulation went on for thousands of years, resulting in a raised platform that, safe from the savannah\u2019s seasonal floods, eventually became colonised by trees. Further analysis, using radiocarbon dating of charcoal or shell fragments within samples from 31 of the sites, reveal human occupation dating as far back as 10,850 years ago \u2013 shortly after the end of the last ice age, when cultivation of plants began independently in various regions of the world. Lombardo and colleagues then examined tiny particles of silica that were found alongside the material for dating. These particles, called phytoliths, form in plant tissues with phytoliths from different types of plants, and sometimes even different species, showing particular shapes. \u201cPhytoliths are plant microfossils,\u201d said Lombardo. \u201cAnd we can use them to identify the plants that lived in that place in the past.\u201d The team report a heart-shaped phytolith that came from cassava at one site, in a sample dating to about 10,350 years ago, with scalloped, spherical phytoliths from the rind of squash plants found in samples dating as far back as 10,250 years ago. Among other discoveries, the researchers found phytoliths from maize that date as far back as 6,850 years ago. The team said the plants had probably been cultivated in home gardens. But whether the plants were domesticated there \u2013 a process involving selection of particular traits \u2013 or were already semi-domesticated is less clear. Lombardo also cautioned that not all plants form phytoliths \u2013 among them are peanuts, which evidence from wild plants in the region suggests come from the south-west of the Amazon basin. Dr Sarah Elliott, an environmental archaeologist from the University of Bournemouth, who was not involved in the research, said the study was significant, noting the team had found the oldest evidence for squash associated directly with human activity and the earliest maize cultivation in the Amazon basin. \u201cThe human impact in the Amazon in the past was thought to be minimal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut new research such as this study demonstrates that the nature of human occupation and alteration of the landscape is extensive, and this region now has evidence for the implementation of cultivation from as far back as 10,250 years [ago].\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
