Tomorrow morning he must stand among them, wearing an England flag and cheering for the team he took 65 Test wickets against. His punishment is the result of losing a series of random sporting events sponsored by Betfair \u2013 pedalo racing among them \u2013 to Phil Tufnell. \"This will be the lowest point of my cricketing life,\" said Gillespie, conveniently overlooking figures in 2005 of one for 137 at Old Trafford. Oval in flutter over flag There were St George's crosses aplenty fluttering at The Oval but where was the Australian flag? The three poles on the pavilion roof are traditionally used by the ECB, England and the visitors, but a Surrey spokesman said: \"No flag was provided to us by the Australians.\" By the time play resumed after lunch, one had been conjured up, but the Australian dressing room was none the wiser. \"No one here even noticed,\" said a team insider. The prosaic truth was left to the club spokesman. \"We sorted it out ourselves,\" he said. KP fails to mask absence Kevin Pietersen may be injured but he's not being injured quietly. Fans who have missed him since he hobbled out of the Lord's Test with achilles trouble could at least look vaguely like him had they got their hands on the KP masks on offer along the Harleyford Road. Players walking up the pavilion steps would have been reminded by a large poster advertising that his thoughts could be read in a Sunday tabloid. The real KP was even spotted in the England dressing room at the scene of his Ashes-clinching 158 in 2005. No love for Collingwood Paul Collingwood will not join the list of Durham players fancied by the pop starlet Lily Allen, who revealed her affection for Graham Onions on Twitter during the Lord's Test. Allen was at the ground yesterday and tweeted: \"Collingwood is dull. He'll probably still be batting when I'm back here at The Oval on Saturday, having scored no runs.\" Not long after, Collingwood flashed intemperately and was out for 24. Fry's apple googly Stephen Fry's love of cricket is no secret. Less well-known is the fact that Fry, a guest of the Surrey committee yesterday, learned how to bowl as a boy using apples from his back garden \u2013 off the wrong foot. \"If I said they were jaffas it would be even more confusing,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
