The American actor and political activist \u2013 who has been protesting about inaction over the climate crisis at the US Capitol every Friday \u2013 has been arrested four times and kept overnight once. Her lawyers have helped her avoid serious charges. But she says the acts of civil disobedience have pulled her out of a depression she sunk into after Donald Trump took office. \u201cWith his election came a need to deeply study things that I didn\u2019t understand enough, including why did he get elected,\u201d Fonda said. \u201cThe answers to why he got elected began way, much earlier. And so that realisation has helped guide where I put my focus as an activist,\u201d Fonda said in an interview with the Guardian. Fonda \u2013 a huge star in the 1960s, 70s and 80s who has recently seen TV success in the hit Netflix show Grace and Frankie \u2013 knew Trump socially before he entered politics. When he won the Republican nomination, she said she was relieved because she thought he would never win. And even if he did, she didn\u2019t expect him to be ideological. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise that he was a crook,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not realise the depth of corruption that exists in our government, and that kind of shocks me. I don\u2019t like to think that this country is like, you know, the Latin American dictatorships, you know, Eastern European dictatorships, Russian dictatorships.\u201d Trump has belittled Fonda\u2019s cause at recent campaign rallies, reminding his supporters that she was arrested decades ago when she was an outspoken critic of the Vietnam war. He also brought up Fonda\u2019s 1972 visit to North Vietnam, which earned her the nickname \u201cHanoi Jane\u201d and still taints her reputation, especially on the right. But Fonda is not just sparring with Republicans with her current campaign \u2013 she says Democrats, like the House leader, Nancy Pelosi, haven\u2019t done enough on the climate crisis either, particularly to help people understand that fossil-fuel companies have known about the crisis and lied. Fonda has supported women\u2019s rights and opposed multiple wars over the past decades. Now she is proving an unlikely ally to the youth climate movement. Her protests aren\u2019t huge, but they have drawn people around the country into activism and garnered plenty of media attention. \u201cI\u2019m in my 80s, and I was literally thinking that I could perhaps learn new skills or do something I\u2019d never done before. And when Trump was elected I realised I can\u2019t, you know, it\u2019s back to the barricades,\u201d Fonda said. She was inspired by 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who she first read about in a book by Naomi Klein. Because of her Asperger\u2019s diagnosis, Greta is \u201cunlike most of us, she\u2019s not affected by compromise and you know, being popular or what other people might think\u201d, Fonda said. \u201cShe can\u2019t learn something horrific and then go about her business.\u201d Thunberg, who began a worldwide movement with her Friday strikes from school, fell into a deep depression over the environmental crisis when she was 11. Fonda identifies with that despair. \u201cWe\u2019re holding grief in our bodies because we know 2.9 billion fewer birds exist in North America than in 1970, because we see pictures of polar bears starving, because we know that tens of millions of people are forced to leave where they live and forests are burning. We, unlike Greta, we go about our lives, but that\u2019s lodged in our bodies. And I think it causes this existential angst,\u201d she said. Fonda still hasn\u2019t met Greta. She wrote to her once, but someone else responded on Greta\u2019s behalf. The weekly Fonda protests \u2013 called Fire Drill Fridays \u2013 typically draw an older crowd, including some veterans. She is often flanked by celebrities \u2013 her Grace and Frankie co-star Sam Waterston, actor Ted Danson and the founders of Ben and Jerry\u2019s ice cream have attended. On the Thursdays before the protests, she features experts on Facebook Live to discuss detailed impacts of the climate crisis \u2013 including how it can exacerbate global unrest. She said she generally understood the problem but wanted to learn more about the specifics and who is to blame. Her plan is to help activate people who already care about climate change but don\u2019t yet grasp its severity. Fonda has been living in Washington DC to avoid the impact on the climate of flying back and forth from California. But she hasn\u2019t been able to cancel all her travel. \u201cWe had to weigh, is it more important for me to be here, to carry out these actions in the long run, or to not fly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that the fossil fuel executives, and the politicians that they\u2019ve purchased, are flying all the time \u2026 And so it would put climate activists at a pretty big disadvantage if we didn\u2019t fly.\u201d Fonda knows she isn\u2019t the perfect climate advocate for every demographic. Asked if her activism could reach many working class Americans, she said: \u201cNo I think, unfortunately, because of the controversy of me in North Vietnam during the war I think that has made me anathema to a lot of those people.\u201d She acknowledges she\u2019s not an expert in every part of climate science either. In a particularly adversarial interview with the BBC this week she was grilled on her sources for saying hundreds of millions of people could be displaced by the crisis. (She was correct, according to the World Bank, which said as many as 143 million people could be displaced by 2050.) But she also was held to account in that interview for comparing fossil fuel companies to Nazis. \u201cJust like crimes against humanity have been put on trial at Nuremberg and elsewhere, the fossil fuel industry will hopefully be held accountable,\u2019 she told Newsnight. Fonda recognises that she and the protesters rallying with her are privileged and have it easy compared to many historical movements, but she said celebrities are an important tool for climate activism and shouldn\u2019t be discounted. \u201cIf I weren\u2019t who I was, Fire Drill Fridays wouldn\u2019t have taken off the way it did. It\u2019s just that simple. I don\u2019t ask to meet with the Senate task force on climate change. They ask to have me come. I have a platform. I have a hit series. And why not use it,\u201d Fonda said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
