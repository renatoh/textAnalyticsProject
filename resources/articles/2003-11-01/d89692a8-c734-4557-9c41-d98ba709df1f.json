In what will be seen as a significant olive branch to the BBC, he admitted the broadcaster has a \"deserved reputation\" in news, current affairs and every other area of programming. Mr Campbell's relatively warm words are in sharp contrast to those in June, when he accused the BBC of pursing an \"anti-war\" agenda during the run-up to war. In a furious letter to the BBC he demanded answers to 12 points of complaint following the now notorious Radio 4 Today programme broadcast alleging the government had sexed up the Iraq intelligence dossier. The letter was just one of the many flashpoints in an unprecedented war of words that culminated with the death of the weapons inspector David Kelly. In a sign of his anger at the BBC, Mr Campbell broke with precedent to make a personal appearance on Channel 4 News. Barely able to control his rage with the BBC's refusal to accept his claim that its journalism was biased, he jabbed his finger and told presenter Jon Snow: \"Let [the BBC ] just accept for once they got it wrong.\" Today Mr Campbell admitted he had got over-heated. \"Its [the BBC's] strength is its reputation. It is a deserved reputation not just for news and current affairs but across the reach. \"Sometimes I get a bit agitato about the whole thing because I don't think you should mess around with that [the BBC's reputation],\" he told today's Marketing Society conference. Mr Campbell, a former tabloid journalist, exercised unprecedented power as No 10's communications chief and was dubbed \"the real deputy prime minister\" when it emerged his influence extended far beyond media matters. Today, he said he was considering a return to journalism although he called on the press to examine its role in reporting politics at a time when, he claimed, relationships between papers and MPs are at a critical low. Mr Campbell admitted he had been asked to step back into the profession on several occasions since leaving Downing Street. \"But I'm not making my mind up on what to do until the new year,\" he said. He also called for a \"honest debate\" within the media about how it reports politics. \"I've been struck since I left No 10 about how much concern there is about the impact of the modern press on Britain as a culture and society.\" He said people were reluctant to argue about the role of the press because they were scared by journalists. \"But the idea that the only good story is that someone built-up is being dragged down is culturally pretty dangerous,\" said Mr Campbell. \"There has got to be a more honest debate within the media about the media,\" he added. Mr Campbell had a notoriously fractious relationship with lobby journalists, he was accused of bullying his pet reporters into supresssing stories and blackballing those who wrote stories he did not like. A ferocious Blair loyalist, he was also linked with whispering campaigns against MPs who had fallen foul of the prime minister - including Mo Mowlam and Clare Short - and this summer he came under heavy fire after the death of Dr Kelly. He said he believed the public wanted an \"unvarnished\" view of politics and newspapers were failing to deliver that. \"The reason for the decline of some newspapers is their inability to accept the public wants things unvarnished, be it from politicians or from the media. \"I think it will come but we are going through a very bad stage and it will go on for some years yet. \"There has got to be a deal between politicians and the media where there is an acceptance that have different jobs to do without seeing each other as sub-human.\" Mr Campbell also claimed he had detected unease among broadsheet and tabloid journalists about the standard of reporting. \"There are a lot of serious heavyweight broadsheet journalists who are quite concerned about this and, even on the tabloids, they think we ought to be able to generate a proper debate,\" he said. \"I think more people in the media are worried about this than let on.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
