A House of Lords ruling allowing the extradition of Pinochet to face torture charges was overturned in 1998 because of a judge\u2019s links to Amnesty International. Lawyers for Cowan will cite the case in a bid to have Carmody disqualified from an appeal by their client against his life sentence for the 2003 murder of Daniel Morcombe, Guardian Australia understands. They will allege apprehended bias on the part of Carmody because of his relationship with Hetty Johnston, a child protection advocate and his one-time adviser who has publicly called for Cowan never to be released. The legal furore, which could lead to Cowan\u2019s appeal going before a new trio of judges, comes after concerns raised by the appeal court president, Margaret McMurdo, about Carmody\u2019s private meeting with Johnston in his chambers on 15 April. Carmody, who wrote to Cowan\u2019s barrister, Peter Davis, about the meeting at McMurdo\u2019s urging, said her concerns stemmed from \u201cpublic statements reportedly made by Johnston critical of the appellant in this matter\u201d. McMurdo and Carmody together heard Cowan\u2019s appeal alongside justice Hugh Fraser five months ago but are yet to hand down their written decisions. Johnston, chief executive of the child protection group Bravehearts, said on Tuesday she felt \u201cembarrassed\u201d to have been embroiled in the legal dispute, which had caused the Morcombe family distress. But she defended her relationship with Carmody in an interview with radio host Ray Hadley, saying \u201cI have known the man for 20 years.\u201d \u201cI think he\u2019s amazing, he\u2019s an absolute legend,\u201d Johnston said. In the Pinochet case, the House of Lords found that a judge\u2019s alignment with a cause or social justice interest related to a case before them could erode their perceived impartiality. The Lords overturned an earlier ruling on an attempt to extradite Pinochet to Spain to face torture charges from his time governing Chile because one judge, Lord Hoffmann, was linked to Amnesty International. Hoffmann\u2019s role as a director and chairman of an Amnesty charity and his wife\u2019s job with the human rights group \u2013 coupled with the fact Amnesty had joined the case to argue in favour of Pinochet\u2019s extradition \u2013 led to the finding of apprehended bias. In a court hearing before Carmody last Friday, Davis argued that Bravehearts was a \u201clobby group\u201d that had \u201cdirectly targeted\u201d Cowan \u201cand yet it seems that the chief justice is associating with the lobby group seemingly to assist it\u201d. Johnston was \u201can ardent public supporter\u201d of the chief justice at a time when his appointment caused unrivalled controversy, dismissing his critics as \u201cpetulant\u201d on the Bravehearts website. Their relationship included Johnston acting as Carmody\u2019s adviser when he ran an inquiry into Queensland\u2019s child protection system, Davis said. He said it was \u201cobviously Johnston\u2019s view that your appointment will change the focus of the criminal justice system from accuseds to victims\u201d. \u201cAfter you have sat on a court considering an appeal by the very man against Ms Johnston has made direct adverse comments, you then meet with her in a private meeting, apparently to discuss the promotion of Bravehearts, an organisation which is a lobby group and who, frankly, has lobbied directly against Mr Cowan,\u201d Davis said. Carmody rejected Davis\u2019s argument, saying the Cowan matter had not been discussed and there was \u201cno serious possibility that a fair-minded person might reasonably apprehend bias\u201d. He earlier refused Davis\u2019s written request \u201cto inform me of the nature and length of your relationship with Ms Johnston\u201d and to detail their meetings since Cowan\u2019s arrest in 2011 and what had been discussed. \u201cA question arises as to whether disclosure of the relationship ought to have been made before the hearing of the appeal,\u201d Davis wrote. Carmody had replied that it was \u201cinappropriate to respond, by private correspondence or in open court, to your questions regarding the content of ostensibly confidential meetings between community leaders and the head of jurisdiction without the matter being formally and properly raised by the parties\u201d. On Twitter, Daniel\u2019s mother, Denise Morcombe, decried the legal wrangling as a \u201csick joke\u201d that had her son \u201cturning in his grave\u201d. \u201cIf the Appeal decision had been handed down in a timely matter, this situation would not have happened. 5 months what a disgrace!\u201d she said. Davis in court pointed to Johnston using the title \u201cHi from Hetty\u201d, the salutation \u201cHi Tim\u201d and a \u201csmiley face\u201d in an email before their meeting as evidence of the pair\u2019s \u201cfamiliarity\u201d. Carmody replied: \u201cThat\u2019s my name ... It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m the chief justice or the chief street sweeper, it\u2019s still my name.\u201d In the email, Johnston requests a meeting to discuss a Bravehearts project called \u201cHubCare ... a new machine learning / analytics response to child protection that can save the gov [sic] 80% in staff admin costs alone let alone the benefits to kids\u201d. \u201cYou need to hear about this because it fits perfectly with the recommendations at the Carmody Inquiry (I am sure you know the one  ),\u201d she wrote. \u201cPerhaps Judge Orazio [Ray] Rinaudo [Queensland\u2019s chief magistrate] might also be interested,\u201d she adds in a later email. Cowan, 45, convicted last year of the 2003 abduction and murder of Morcombe, 13, was sentenced to life imprisonment with 20 years no parole."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
