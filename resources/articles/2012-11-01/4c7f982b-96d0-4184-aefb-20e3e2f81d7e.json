Goode wore the No15 jersey but was given a free role in attack, operating at both first and second receiver at times and giving the fly-half, Toby Flood, an outlet that England lacked in last season's Six Nations. The full-back was involved in three of his side's first four tries and Fiji struggled to adapt to his roving role. \"We cannot make as many mistakes in the coming weeks,\" said Goode, after making only his second international start. \"Some bits could have been better against Fiji: some opportunities went begging and at times we were a bit lateral. Perhaps that was down to over-eagerness but there will be an improvement from us. We know that, if we play as well as we can, we are good enough to blow teams out of the window.\" England have not had a player like Goode in their back division since Mike Catt, the current attack coach, retired. He brings to mind the former centre Will Greenwood in the way he brings other players into play through the timing of his pass and the positions he takes up. \"What is great about Alex is that he will move into first receiver happily and communicate well when he is not there,\" Flood said. \"He has the ability with his movement and passing to create space for others and his spatial awareness is acute. As two fly-halves, we look for similar things. Alex is a real thinker, a brains man behind the scrum, and having him outside is superb for me.\" The selection of Goode, which bears Catt's imprimatur, allowed England to continue with two physical centres, Brad Barritt and Manu Tuilagi. \"New Zealand and Australia tend to have two ball players in their back lines at 10 and 12 but Alex operates a bit wider out for us,\" Flood said. \"He facilitates things and we know we need to expose defences in the coming weeks if we are to fulfil our ambition of winning by playing really good rugby.\" Attack is the focus for England this autumn after a period of consolidation in the Six Nations and in South Africa this summer following last year's ruinous World Cup campaign. Flood likes to operate on the gain line, bringing runners into play, allowing Goode to take up a deeper position and spot space. Like Catt and Greenwood, Goode is composed under pressure. \"There were times when Toby and I linked well together but there were other occasions when we could have punched into Fiji much better,\" Goode said. \"We have to be a bit more confrontational and we have to recognise that at times Fiji allowed us to get on the outside but attack takes time to evolve. The early days under Stuart [Lancaster, the head coach] were based on hard work, defence, a kicking game and the set pieces but the autumn is all about pushing on from that and we know we have to raise our intensity against Australia, South Africa and New Zealand.\" Flood believes that England's growing attacking perception will help his Leicester club-mate Tuilagi, whose two tries against Fiji took his total in 14 Tests to seven, become one of the leading centres in the world. \"He is going to become an absolutely unbelievable player,\" Flood said. \"When I was his age, I was making my debut. His game has grown some 15% since I first appeared with him and it will grow by another 40% by the time he is 26: there is a huge gap between where he is now and his ceiling. \"He will get better with his decision-making when he has the ball; you do not have much space or time in a Test match and it is about drip-feeding information into him.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
