The Italian became the first coach to do the double over a Pep Guardiola team after Eden Hazard\u2019s first-half brace, and a strong defensive second-half showing, secured a narrow victory over City. The success maintained the leaders\u2019 seven-point advantage over Spurs \u2013 who scored three times in the last few minutes at Swansea to secure a sixth successive win \u2013 and pepped confidence after Saturday\u2019s rare and untimely loss to Crystal Palace. \u201cAt this point of the season the pressure is very high, and to drop points would have given hope to your opponents,\u201d said Conte. \u201cSo this is a good win for us against a top team, with great players and the best coach in the world. When you face this type of combination, it\u2019s tough to win, especially after a defeat to Palace. So this was another step \u2013 a big step \u2013 against a great team with a lot of qualities. \u201cFor all my players and me, only if you win [the title] do you write the season down in history. If we don\u2019t do that, it will have been a good season, but not a \u2018great\u2019 season. So the only message I have given my team is that [to assume] Tottenham must win their last eight games. So we must make six wins and the 18 points we need. If we do this, we win the title. \u201cIn Italy it\u2019s easier for me to find the right words to motivate my players. I am studying English but I\u2019m not at a great level to give great motivational talks. But I try. I push sometimes with words, sometimes with my hands. Numbers now \u2026 six wins. Six wins. There is a long way to go.\u201d Conte rejoiced in Hazard\u2019s 12th and 13th goals of a productive season with Chelsea, who travel to Bournemouth on Saturday, unlikely to be sanctioned by the Football Association for Diego Costa\u2019s ugly lunge, while grounded, on Vincent Kompany. The striker had caught the City centre-half on the knee 20 minutes from time, but the referee Mike Dean appeared to have witnessed the incident, thereby ruling out the possibility of retrospective action. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to see this type of situation during the game,\u201d offered Conte. Guardiola shrugged off mention of the challenge. The City manager conceded his side\u2019s priorities have become Champions League qualification and the FA Cup, though he claimed to be hugely satisfied with his team\u2019s performance even in defeat. \u201cToday the Premier League has gone, so we have to think about finishing in the top four,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cAbsolutely, we were the better team, but they got six points against us over the two games and we got zero. Football is also about results. \u201cBut the way we played? I\u2019m so satisfied. I\u2019m a lucky guy to be here with them. I was happier today with the way we played compared to Arsenal on Sunday, and we got a point less. I don\u2019t want to see the way we played against Arsenal again. We were 1,000 miles better than in that game. Of course, I\u2019d have liked to have taken one or three points, but, in the boxes, Chelsea are better than us. Hopefully next season we\u2019ll be stronger to do that. We have to analyse things for next season because we have to win games like this. But, for now, congratulations to Chelsea.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
