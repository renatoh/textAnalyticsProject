Not only that, but people are ready to tell their tales of woe with just the slightest provocation. Ask someone what's going on and you're likely to hear, \"Nothing. As usual.\" Even a casual encounter can produce a psychic boost. For instance, this morning I ran into my neighbor near the trash chute and asked, how are you? \"Terrible!\" he replied. Music to my ears. A few minutes later on the elevator, a woman who looked sullen complained to a man who appeared tortured about her colitis. I entered the lift mid-way into the conversation but distinctly heard the words: \"It's chronic pain.\" Everyone is miserable. It's very liberating. Lately, I've been thinking I should go back to therapy. The problem is, I live in the West Village and my therapist's office is 70 blocks uptown on the Upper West Side. It's such a commitment. Leaving the apartment, walking to the subway, waiting for the train to arrive, enduring the local stops because the express doesn't stop at 79th Street, then hiking another three long blocks. For what. Mental stability? I'm exhausted just thinking about it. My friend Lizzie is the same. She's shopping for a shrink at the moment and her only criterion is that he or she is in the same neighbourhood. \"I loved my old shrink,\" she says. \"But I had stop going because her office was across town.\" Meanwhile, this is someone who would cross the Alps barefoot for a sale at Diane von Furstenberg. A few weeks ago she went to a 70% off sale at Frette linens in DUMBO. Brooklyn. A different borough! So when it comes to Egyptian cotton sheets, she's intrepid. When it comes to mental health, not so much. Money is also an issue. My therapy isn't covered on insurance so for the past few years it's been a question of: a dinner out or ... a stable future. How screwed up is that? I guess I'll never know since I'd sooner spend $75 on a piece of salmon then sorting out my emotional wellbeing. So I've decided to turn my friends into my therapist. I just ask, \"how are you?\" and 45 minutes later, I'm elated. sourpuss20@aol.com"}, "isHosted": false}}}
