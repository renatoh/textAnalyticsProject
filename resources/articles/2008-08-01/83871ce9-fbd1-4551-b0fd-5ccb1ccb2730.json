Changi Airports International, which is owned by the Singapore government, expressed cautious interest yesterday and is unlikely to be alone. \"We are open to evaluating the deal, but we will wait to see if the terms are attractive,\" said a Changi Airports spokeswoman. A host of other companies headed by the German group Hochtief, the Manchester Airport Group, Macquarie, Global Infrastructure Partners and Spain's Abertis, which owns Luton, Cardiff and Belfast airports, are all seen as possible contenders - though Abertis's ownership of Luton could prove a stumbling block to its purchase of one of BAA's London airports. The commission has made it clear that if it did force BAA to sell two of its three London airports it would not allow them to go to the same buyer. It will also make sure that bidders have the financial resources and experience of airport management. Though any sale is likely to be more than a year away, the aviation industry is facing hard times amid soaring fuel bills and slowing economic growth. As BAA reported recently, its airports handled a total of 14.8 million passengers last month, a drop of 1.7% on July last year. The weakening economic climate, rising airfares and airline capacity cuts meant that each airport in the group and most major markets lost ground in July. In a research note yesterday, Andrew Fitchie, an analyst at Collins Stewart, wrote: \"On the one hand, there are plenty of funds out there with money to invest in airports. However, on the other hand, airport valuations have fallen (reflecting tighter credit conditions and a more uncertain aviation environment) and it's never good to be a forced seller. We would also expect the uncertainty of changes [toughening] to the regulatory model would weigh down on potential value.\" Ashley Steel, the head of KPMG's infrastructure practice, warned: \"Meaningful valuations will be tricky to achieve in the current market, though the infrastructure sector has been holding good value. \"Unravelling the airports from BAA - so that they are in a position to be sold - will also be a mammoth task, requiring careful handling. \"There will be enormous structural difficulties [involving technology, property, data, people contractors, service providers, pensions etc] in separation. Managing these whilst continuing to operate the airports will not be straightforward.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
