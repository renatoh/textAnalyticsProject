The clip came from an interview Fauci gave to Fox News, in which he was describing the work that he and other members of the White House coronavirus task force undertook to respond to the virus, not Trump. A majority of Americans do not approve of the president\u2019s handling of the crisis, according to several recent polls. The Trump campaign said it would not stop running the adverts. \u201cThese are Dr Fauci\u2019s own words,\u201d said Trump\u2019s communication director Tim Murtaugh. \u201cThe video is from a nationally broadcast television interview in which Dr Fauci was praising the work of the Trump administration. \u201cThe words are accurate and directly from Dr Fauci\u2019s mouth.\u201d For months during the course of the pandemic, Trump has often been at odds with Fauci, delivering contradictory public health messages and publicly expressing frustration with the doctor\u2019s more sober take on the crisis. In the spring, as the virus ravaged the north-east of the country, Fauci was a regular at the White House\u2019s coronavirus press briefings. But in June, Fauci said he was no longer invited to the briefings, with Trump claiming to Fox News that Fauci was \u201ca nice man, but he made a lot of mistakes\u201d. Polls conducted in early summer found a majority of Americans trusted Fauci\u2019s assessments of the pandemic, whereas less than a third trusted Trump\u2019s. As cases began to rise across many parts of the country, Trump encouraged states to quickly reopen their economies for the summer. Fauci at the time cautioned against reopening without appropriate social distancing measures in place, contradicting Trump\u2019s messaging that states should not delay. Fauci has largely remained a neutral, authoritative public health figure over the course of the pandemic, refusing to harshly criticise the administration\u2019s approach, and opting to do dozens of virtual interviews to offer his recommendations to Americans. Trump has since replaced Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, another respected public health expert who was once a regular at the White House press briefing, with Dr Scott Atlas, who is neither an epidemiologist nor an infectious disease expert. Atlas, a regular on the Fox news network, has come under scrutiny by public health experts for questioning the effectiveness of masks and parroting the Trump administration\u2019s optimistic timeline for a Covid-19 vaccine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
