This would be quite a shift in plans for Fury, who stopped Dereck Chisora to earn his shot at Klitschko but who now might challenge a fighter he resembles more closely in both personality and style. \u201cIf my fight [with Stiverne] goes well,\u201d Wilder said on Friday, \u201cand if Klitschko fights [Bryant] Jennings this year [which is likely in late spring], I want to fight Tyson Fury and, if possible, I want to come to the UK for that fight. My plan is to deal with Stiverne, challenge Fury and, at the end of the year, unify the whole division by challenging Klitschko. That would be an awesome year.\u201d Wilder, contrary to the sport\u2019s custom and practice, had kind words to say about Britain\u2019s best heavyweights, Fury and Anthony Joshua, who are both unbeaten and, like himself, carrying the hopes of fans, promoters and television executives. \u201cAs a fighter I like Fury,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cHe\u2019s like me, he\u2019s entertaining. Not many guys have it. I\u2019m not pretending to be something I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m exciting, I\u2019m funny, I have a lot of charisma. Fury is the same, he likes to entertain the crowd and it\u2019s all natural. \u201cPeople can sense bullshit. But when you\u2019ve got somebody who can do it naturally it\u2019s a whole different thing. That would be an awesome fight.\u201d As for Joshua, who has had to reschedule after injury forced him out of his 11th pro contest against the hard-to-beat American Kevin Johnson this month, Wilder said: \u201cAnthony is still growing so it\u2019s hard to tell. You guys in the UK are always behind your fighters, which is a great thing, even if they just have potential. But sometimes it can be a lot of pressure on a fighter too \u2013 \u2018he\u2019s the biggest this and that\u2019. But I wish him nothing but luck and success. I want to see everybody make it; that way nobody is hating.\u201d Stiverne, a Haiti-born Canadian, and Wilder had their final press conference on Thursday, with the ritual exchange of pleasantries. But in more reflective mood in a recent interview on Showtime (which will show the fight in America while BoxNation screens it in the UK), the challenger was as humble as a waiter. He spoke tellingly about how he took up boxing at 19 to earn money to pay for medical treatment for his one-year-old daughter, Naieya, who was born with spina bifida. He left college, drove a beer truck and worked in a restaurant. After a handful of amateur fights he won bronze at the Beijing Olympics and turned professional with Jay Deas, a former TV crime reporter who sparred but never boxed competitively. Deas now shares managerial duties for Wilder with Al Haymon, who looks after Floyd Mayweather and takes some of his stable back to terrestrial TV with NBC in March. Wilder\u2019s has been an unlikely and inspiring story. Naieya was not expected to walk or overcome learning difficulties but Wilder did not lose hope. Today, after five operations, she leads a full life and her father is likely to wake up on Sunday morning the WBC heavyweight champion of the world. There could hardly be a sharper physical contrast than that between the 6ft 7in heavyweight and his tiny nine-year-old daughter, who did a flip for the Showtime cameras to demonstrate her love of gymnastics. For all his compassion Wilder is a ruthless finisher, often living up to his surname as he sacrifices discipline for raw power. Stiverne, too, is an uncompromising customer. It could be short and brutal, whoever wins. If these are the heavyweights who might rescue the division from the doldrums nobody has told Klitschko. He has stopped all eight American challengers during his long second reign, which began in 2006, as well as five who went before those doomed souls when he first held the title. In the division they once dominated the last American to hold a version of the world title was Shannon Briggs, briefly the WBO champion in 2006, and now six winning fights into a comeback at 43. Wilder is convinced this is his time even though the 32 opponents he has been fed since turning pro have been so ordinary they have survived a combined 58 rounds, most of them seeking the mercy of the referee after initial contact. None has seen the fifth round; for 18 of them \u2013 including Audley Harrison \u2013 the only bell they heard was the one to start the bout. Stiverne will by some way be Wilder\u2019s toughest opponent having won the title by stopping the rugged Chris Arreola last year. Nevertheless there is something special about Wilder that goes beyond his impressive knockout record. He has an inner grit and a back story that would move a marine to tears. He is doing this for himself, of course, but mostly for Naieya. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201d Wilder observed. \u201cA lot of Americans have been yearning for an American champion \u2013 they want an American champion, they want the excitement. \u201cIf any fighter in America is up for that job, then hands down it\u2019s me. I\u2019ve got everything. I\u2019m the total package \u2013 I\u2019m entertaining, I\u2019m exciting, I got charisma and I\u2019ve got that one-punch knockout power. That\u2019s what everyone comes to see.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
