My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it,\u201d Obama trailed off, at once frustrated and spirited at the White House. \u201cWe\u2019ve become numb to this \u2026 We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg; after Tucson, after Newtown; after Aurora, after Charleston.\u201d The words mark a long list of tragedy. Since Obama\u2019s re-election to a second term in November 2012 \u2013 which itself was followed by the shooting of 26 people including 20 children at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, just a few weeks later \u2013 there had been 993 mass shooting events in the United States . Thursday\u2019s attack, at Umpqua community college in the town of Roseburg, was No 994. Almost 300 of them have occurred in 2o15. That\u2019s almost one every day. Obama has spoken or issued statements 15 times in the wake of mass shooting events. \u201cI\u2019ve made statements like this too many times,\u201d he said after the church shooting this June in Charleston, South Carolina. The numbers go deeper than the statements, as the president said. Umpqua is the 294th mass shooting event in 2015, as defined by the website Shootingtracker.com, which chronicles them as an event in which four or more people are shot. Since the Newtown shooting, there have now been 994 such events in the US. The death toll of this litany of tragedy stands at approximately 1,236 people since the beginning of 2013. By the FBI\u2019s definition \u2013 four or more killed rather than four or more shot, a \u201cmass murder\u201d event rather than a \u201cmass shooting\u201d \u2013 there have been 45 such incidents this year, and 142 since Sandy Hook. America\u2019s gun problem goes deeper still: on the day of the Newtown shooting, many noted that if that had been the only shooting that day, the day\u2019s death toll from gun violence would have been below the US average. That was even more true on Thursday. The number of firearm homicides in 2013, the last year for which the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has statistics, was 11,208. The year before Sandy Hook, it was 107 fewer than that. That\u2019s just intentional homicides. Firearms are the cause of death for more than 33,000 people in America every year, according to the CDC; a number that includes both accidental discharge, murder and suicides, which are on the increase, especially in states with lax gun-control laws, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. That means guns kill more people in America every six hours than terrorist attacks did in the entire year of 2014. On top of that, in 2010 more than 73,000 Americans were treated in hospitals for firearm-related injuries, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. This year is on track to break records. So far in 2015 there have been 39,449 total firearm incidents, according to the Gun Violence Archive, and 9,940 people killed. Of those, 550 were children, and 1,962 were teenagers. Almost half of all guns in civilian ownership on the planet are held by Americans. And the Guardian\u2019s The Counted project, which tracks killings by police, has thus far tracked 762 people killed by police gunfire this year alone. It is also much more dangerous to be a police officer in a state with lax gun laws, according to the American Journal of Public Health. As the former attorney general Eric Holder tweeted soon after the news of the killings broke: \u201cWe weep again as a nation\u201d: \u201cI hope and pray that I don\u2019t have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences,\u201d Obama said behind the podium at the White House. \u201cBased on my experiences as president, I can\u2019t guarantee that \u2013 and that\u2019s a terrible thing to say.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
