This knack enabled him to shrug off comments from Mike Ashley suggesting he would be sacked were Newcastle to lose at Stoke City on Monday night. Although Ashley\u2019s lawyers swiftly dismissed the owner\u2019s \u201crevelations\u201d as \u201ctongue in cheek\u201d the episode would have provoked a bout of extreme paranoia in many managers. \u201cSometimes things are taken out of context,\u201d Pardew said after learning of Ashley\u2019s late-night conversation with a national newspaper reporter following a chance meeting outside a central London pub. \u201cI think Mike was trying to be supportive \u2013 in his own kind of way.\u201d Not that Newcastle\u2019s manager is in denial. Indeed, as club officials reiterated claims that the retail magnate had merely been \u201cjoking\u201d, Pardew remained brutally realistic about the precarious nature of his position at St James\u2019 Park. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen or spoken to Mike this week,\u201d said Pardew as he prepared to take his bottom-placed side to Stoke, where they will seek their first Premier League win of the season. \u201cBut he\u2019s obviously very keen for us to get victories \u2013 that\u2019s what he\u2019s about, winning. \u201cI\u2019m carrying some scars and I\u2019ve been under pressure at this club for a number of weeks now but all I can focus on now is the team. The focus for me really can only be on Monday night. We\u2019re very conscious we haven\u2019t had a win but it\u2019s not a boxing match, so we can\u2019t just fight our way to victory. We\u2019ve got to get the right balance between having enough fight and being relaxed to play enough good football.\u201d While Pardew is expected to start Papiss Ciss\u00e9 \u2013 whose two goals rescued a point against Hull City in Newcastle\u2019s last League game \u2013 on the bench on Monday night as the Senegal striker eases his way back following surgery on a broken kneecap last April, he is delighted to see Cheik Tiot\u00e9 and Fabricio Coloccini returning to something approaching top form. While Coloccini\u2019s performances had dipped before the game against Hull, Tiot\u00e9 missed the start of the season with a hamstring injury and was previously unsettled by rumours regarding a mooted summer move to Lokomotiv Moscow. Yet with Coloccini commanding central defence, Tiot\u00e9 enforcing central midfield and Ciss\u00e9 almost ready to resume at centre-forward, Pardew feels his side have finally regained a decent spine. \u201cYou do need big players, blue riband players, at this football club,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager who will urge Ashley to extend Tiote\u2019s contract beyond its current expiry date of June 2017. \u201cAnd Fabricio and Cheik are two very important players for us. \u201cWe had a team fighting for Cheik\u2019s services in the summer. The finance was never really in place but Cheik was unsettled by it for a period. I think he\u2019s happy here now though. I love him. He\u2019s everything you want in a Newcastle player.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
