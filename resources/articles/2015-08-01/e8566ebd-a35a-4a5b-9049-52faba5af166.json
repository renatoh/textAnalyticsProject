It\u2019s Hans free.\u201d With that one-liner, and subsequent weary groans across Edinburgh, Darren Walsh has won the award for the best joke of this year\u2019s fringe festival \u2013 beating the youngest ever nominee for the prize in the process. 12-year-old comedian Grace the Child snuck into 10th place in the public vote, with her joke: \u201cThey\u2019re always telling me to live my dreams. But I don\u2019t want to be naked in an exam I haven\u2019t revised for.\u201d It\u2019s taken from her debut solo show, Playground Politics, though her standup career started when she was eight \u2013 she has since delivered sets at Greenwich comedy festival, Camp Bestival, Norway\u2019s Toumazeing festival, and the respected London comedy venue Soho Theatre. Walsh was voted the best by 2,000 members of the public, surveyed by comedy TV channel Dave, which drew up a shortlist from suggestions by comedy critics; the 39-year-old secured 23% of the votes. In second place was Stewart Francis with a slightly cruel aside \u2013 \u201cKim Kardashian is saddled with a huge arse ... but enough about Kanye West\u201d \u2013 while Adam Hess came third by wondering: \u201cSurely every car is a people carrier?\u201d Walsh\u2019s joke was part of his show Punderbolt, and his success follows his 2013 win at the inaugural UK pun championships, as well as the publication of his pun compendium Cheep Laughs. On receiving the accolade, he said: \u201cI am delighted to win this award. What a punderful feeling.\u201d He succeeds last year\u2019s winner Tim Vine, who was voted top with the following gag: \u201cI\u2019ve decided to sell my hoover. Well, it was just collecting dust.\u201d This year\u2019s runner-up Stewart Francis won the award back in 2012 for, \u201cYou know who really gives kids a bad name? Posh and Becks\u201d, but was also listed in the worst trio of puns this year for, \u201cI am Canadian. But if you think I\u2019m Russian, Soviet.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
