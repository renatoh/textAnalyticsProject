So top marks to Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury for admitting in a lecture earlier this week that judges' judgments tend to be so attentive to every detail of the argument that sometimes he felt the will to live ebbing away. It might have been taken as a lordly put down to more junior colleagues, had he not admitted that it had happened to him when reading his own rulings. His point was that catatonically long judgments impeded access to justice. So too would proposals to restrict cases that could go to judicial review, the steep cuts in legal aid, and successive governments' tendency to observe what he called the Mikado principle of legislation: to pass a law was to deal with a problem. There are three times as many laws now as in 1965, but there's no evidence that people feel three times better governed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
