On the contrary, she holds those who staff our mortuaries, funeral parlours and crematoria with respect, having closely observed them at work through the lens of her camera. Her exhibition, Behind the Last Closed Door, opens at Wolverhampton's Lighthouse Gallery this week, offering a glimpse into what lies just beyond when we \"shuffle off this mortal coil\". It seems an odd subject in a society where increasing life expectancy and decreasing religious faith have made many of us value the here and now rather than contemplate a remote and uncertain eternity. \"A century ago it would have been very different,\" she muses. \"Death was part of life and had to be confronted.\" Peters, 24, has had to confront it herself. For five years, she was the registered carer for her grandmother. Having begun training as a nurse before switching to photography at Birmingham City University, she had no qualms about laying out the body and washing it. What she found more difficult was to assuage the grief that she felt for a woman 60 years her senior. \"Doing this project helped,\" she says. \"I found it therapeutic to go back to the sort of places where her body had gone to.\" The last that most of us see of our nearest and dearest is the coffin sliding slowly along the crematorium plinth. But Peters' pictures also take us behind the plush curtains to see what it's like on the other side of that conveyor belt of bodily remains. In a little room to the right is what looks suspiciously like a CCTV screen. Surely the camera's not trained on the congregation? \"No, only on the pulpit, so that the person in the control room knows when to start the music,\" Peters confirms. Her own camera has also delved into what's left when the ashes finally cool \u2013 here a slightly rusting prosthetic hip, there a Sikh ceremonial dagger. \"The Co-op has a whole section for Sikh and Muslim funerals,\" she says. Indeed one of her pictures shows a Hessian sack being sewn up to meet the wishes of a deceased Muslim that his remains should be sent back to Pakistan. \"No matter how many bodies they deal with, undertakers always show respect, blending into the background at funerals,\" Peters maintains. As if to emphasise their lack of obtrusiveness, one of her shots is of two almost ghostly figures reflected in the gleaming rear window of a hearse \u2013 almost the last closed door. \u0095 Behind the Last Closed Door is at the Lighthouse Gallery, Wolverhampton, until September 18"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
