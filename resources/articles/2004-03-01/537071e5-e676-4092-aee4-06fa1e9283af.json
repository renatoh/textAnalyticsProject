A one-day series regarded by many as the greatest ever is finally over, and in the end India had just a bit too much for Pakistan, clinching a 3-2 series with a 40-run victory in another dramatic, frenzied contest under the lights at Lahore. India, in control for most of the match, were given a late scare during a feisty partnership between Shoaib Malik and Moin Khan. But they kept their nerve and, when Lakshmipathy Balaji pinged Moin's off stump to finish the match, the whole team formed an impromptu huddle and started dancing giddily. One-day victories are rarely celebrated as wildly is this. Their victory owed most to VVS Laxman, who struck a high-class 107, and Sachin Tendulkar, who took a brilliant catch at long-on to dismiss the Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq when he was hitting his stride. Inzamam had redemption on his mind, after putting India in when he won the toss and watching them pile up a sizeable - if not, by the standards of this series, insurmountable - score of 293 for 7. Tendulkar set the tone with a rapid 37, before Laxman and Sourav Ganguly added 92 for the third wicket in 18 overs. Laxman, as pristine as ever, struck 11 fours in 104 balls, his first significant innings of this series. Since being dropped for last year's World Cup, he has reached fifty five times in one-day internationals - and each time he has gone on to a century. India's total looked about par, but then Pakistan got off to an appalling start. Yasir Hameed and Yousuf Youhana were gone inside three overs and, when Inzamam was brilliantly caught by Tendulkar, they were 87 for 5. Ultimately that was the decisive moment: Inzamam, on the charge, flogged Murali Kartik towards the long-on boundary where Tendulkar, charging round, managed to hang on to the catch and judge his movement so that he did not step on or over the rope. It was not quite on a par with his miracle catch off Allan Lamb in the Lord's Test of 1990, but it was a breathtaking piece of work nonetheless. By then India had lost Sourav Ganguly, stretchered off with a back injury sustained as he dived to stop an Inzamam off-drive, and they began to look slightly rudderless when Malik and Moin made an impossible target - 176 off 20 overs with four wickets remaining - look tantalisingly within the bounds of possibility. Eventually, after a partnership of 99 in 17 overs, Shoaib holed out off Virender Sehwag, and the game was almost up. Mohammad Sami struck one mighty six before being bowler by Zaheer Khan, Shoaib Akhtar dawdled and was run out, and then Balaji finished all off. It may never have been said about a one-day series before, but this was one contest most people did not want to end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
