The Institute for Chartered Accountants for England and Wales (ICAEW) told MPs that this could have a \u201csystemic\u201d impact on the confidence in the British economy. \u201cI would like to have this on record, it is likely we may well see after November 1 a flurry of profit warnings from companies finding themselves in completely unprecedented circumstances,\u201d Martin Manuzi, the regional director for Europe of the ICAEW told the Brexit select committee. The ICAEW has about 100,000 members, including the big accountancy firms, which provide auditing for the UK\u2019s biggest companies. Manuzi said if there was a sudden \u201cdislocation\u201d in the market, public limited companies would be obliged to tell their shareholders. \u201cThings that we ask ourselves? What is the cumulative effect on market confidence of the issuing of such profit warnings, and a systemic lack of confidence can have massive macroeconomic impacts,\u201d he said. Giles Derrington, the head of Brexit policy at techUK, told the committee that the decline in investment in startups was having a damaging impact on the UK\u2019s reputation as the obvious place for tech outside the US. He said in the first three months of 2019 venture capital investment in the UK had fallen by \u201cabout 58% in terms of the deals done\u201d and Germany was now catching up with the UK, which had been the clear frontrunner in the sector before. The Brexit committee was hearing evidence about the impact of Brexit on the services sector, which accounts for 80% of the UK\u2019s economy. Manuzi denied his statements were part of \u201cproject fear\u201d when challenged by two MPs. \u201cI\u2019m not here to do scaremongering,\u201d he said. His members had \u2018\u201cvery deep concerns\u201d about a loss of access to EU markets and it was very likely companies would be \u201clooking again at what their profit forecasts will be and they may well be issuing statements\u201d if there was no Brexit deal. Manuzi\u2019s comments came a day after Boris Johnson said the UK would quit the EU on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d if he became prime minister. Manuzi said his members had been clear they did did not want a disorderly Brexit and still hoped the new prime minister would not plunge the UK into a no-deal departure. MPs also heard that Brexit uncertainty was causing \u201creputational impact\u201d on tech investment, one of the UK\u2019s flagship sectors. Derrington told the committee that a no-deal outcome would have \u201csignificant impact\u201d on data flows, the ability to recruit talented people and \u201cwider perceptional reputation damage to the UK as a place for the global tech centre to come and grow and develop\u201d. \u201cUK might be the best place to invest, but it is no longer the only place to invest,\u201d he said. He said established firms were getting their funding but it was the \u201cnew, more risky innovative startups\u201d that were vulnerable. This alone was a concern as to attract tech investors, a country had to have the entire \u201cecosystem\u201d of \u201cvery large multinationals, strong UK mid-tiers, successful growing firms and exciting startups working in tandem\u201d. \u201cSo if you lose one, the longer-term impact of that can cascade over five, 10 years. \u201cIn an industry that moves very, very quickly, it\u2019s then very hard to catch up,\u201d he said. He said France and Germany were making a big play for Brexit dividends in the tech centre and this was contributing to a decline in investment in the UK. In 2018, the UK had \u201calmost double\u201d the tech venture capital of Germany, but year on year there had been a 20% decline for Britain and Germany had a 30% increase. \u201cThe worry is that gap sufficiently closing that we are no longer the obvious global hub outside America,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
