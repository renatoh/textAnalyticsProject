Women targeted by Worboys are devastated by the imminent release of the black-cab driver, who \u201cdenied his heinous crimes and then forced [victims] to endure the torment of a criminal trial\u201d, said Richard Scorer of Slater and Gordon. Scorer represents eight of Worboys\u2019 alleged victims who were not included in the original criminal prosecution. On Friday night the Crown Prosecution Service revealed that while it had prosecuted Worboys for attacks on 14 women, it had dropped cases involving three other women, even though it assessed they \u201cpassed the evidential test\u201d, because there were sufficient counts \u201cto enable the judge to impose an appropriate sentence\u201d. Worboys, 60, has spent nine years and nine months in prison, including time on remand. He was given an indeterminate sentence, which had a minimum term of eight years, for drugging and sexually assaulting 12 women, including raping one of them. He is likely to be freed within weeks. After he was jailed in 2009, police also told prosecutors about another 19 alleged victims, but the CPS advised that it would be in the public interest only to prosecute allegations of rape. One victim, who gave evidence against Worboys in his 2009 trial, lambasted the parole board\u2019s decision to let him go. Speaking on condition of anonymity, she led demands for a full explanation as to why he was now considered to be no danger to women. The call was backed by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and the chair of the home affairs select committee, Yvette Cooper. \u201cFor the parole board to find Worboys safe to release after such a short time is shocking, not least because they won\u2019t tell us why,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cWe need transparency as a matter of urgency. What do the parole board know that we don\u2019t that means he\u2019s no longer considered a serious danger to women?\u201d A total of 105 complaints against Worboys reached the CPS, but the Guardian understands he was formally protesting his innocence as recently as two years ago. In March 2013 he applied to have his convictions reviewed by the criminal cases review commission, only withdrawing the claim in May 2015. Scotland Yard said in statement: \u201cNo new information has been received at this time; there is currently no live Met investigation. Should any further information come to light it will be fully investigated.\u201d The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on whether it would change the law to allow details of parole decisions to be released, and the political fallout of the case looked likely to spread to Theresa May. The prime minister has backed the police against two of Worboys\u2019 victims in a continuing supreme court battle over police blunders in their investigations, which is due for a ruling within weeks. As home secretary, May intervened to support Scotland Yard\u2019s case that it should not be held liable under the Human Rights Act for its failings. Two of Worboys\u2019 victims had already won an appeal court ruling that police failed to carry out an effective investigation. Even though he drove one of those victims to a police station, having been persuaded to do so by another man, officers dismissed her as a drunk and failed to take Worboys\u2019 name or car registration. The other victim, who had been drugged and raped, went to police but they did not even log it as a serious sexual assault. The human rights organisation Liberty said May \u201chas serious questions to answer\u201d about her backing of the police. The parole board is meanwhile facing anger over the decision to release Worboys, and for the failure to inform all his victims before the announcement was made. Nick Hardwick, who chairs the board, apologised unreservedly because two victims had not been informed of the decision, but pointed out that it was the role of the probation service\u2019s victim contact team to pass on the information. Hardwick defended the decision, saying the law prevented any publication of the three-person panel\u2019s decision-making process. However, he said the case highlighted the need for greater transparency and that he had \u201cradical plans\u201d to change the rules. He has been called to explain the parole board\u2019s decisions to the Commons justice committee. Robert Neill, who chairs the committee, said: \u201cIn my view it is ridiculous that the current rules prevent the board making public the reasons for their decisions.\u201d Scorer is representing women who successfully sued Worboys in the civil courts, but were not included on the indictment in his 2009 trial, even though they gave statements to the police. He said the question of whether Worboys had admitted his crimes was crucial. \u201cIf he still denies his crimes, then he clearly poses a continuing risk to women,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he now admits that he deliberately and systematically drugged and raped women, then the police need to look at whether there are any crimes that he was not convicted of and seek justice for those victims.\u201d Scorer said that when he visited Worboys in jail in 2013 he was \u201cclearly a very manipulative and dangerous individual\u201d and that he was \u201cconcerned [Worboys] may have fooled the board into believing he is no longer a threat\u201d. Keir Starmer, who was the director of public prosecutions at the time of the conviction and is now a member of the shadow cabinet, said: \u201cIt is very important that if there are any allegations anybody thinks have not been looked into sufficiently, they go to the police.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
