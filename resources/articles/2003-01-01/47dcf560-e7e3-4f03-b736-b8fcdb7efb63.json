Aidan Cotter, the coroner holding the inquests into the shootings of Charlene Ellis and Latisha Shakespeare, said the black community should cooperate with the police as \"payback\" for Birmingham's dedication in accommodating people of all faiths and colours. But today Mr Blunkett criticised Mr Cotter, saying no one should talk about \"payback\". Mr Cotter has already apologised for his remarks, saying: \"If I used language less carefully than I should, I regret it.\" \"But to interpret it as saying that I was criticising the black community as against the white community is nonsense,\" he said. \"That is not what I said. That is not what I believe.\" At the inquest, he had originally said: \"It is time for your community to pay back and conform with our belief, which is that everybody has a duty to cooperate with the police, to make sure the murderers are caught and they are not given protection by their friends or even their families.\" But today Mr Blunkett warned everyone had to be careful with their choice of language. An inquest was opened and adjourned on Thursday into the death of Ms Ellis, 18, who died with her cousin after attending a party at a hairdressing salon in the Aston area of the city. Mr Cotter has also declared he will write to Mr Blunkett asking him to spend more money on tackling escalating gun crime in Birmingham. Mr Blunkett said people had a responsibility to help the police. \"I don't think anyone should talk about 'pay back' because they are part of a cohesive community, we are in this together, we are citizens of the same country,\" he said. \"In each neighbourhood, people have a responsibility to help the police and to help the criminal justice system capture and demonstrate to the rest of the community that that capture will lead to very very severe sentence indeed\" The family of Ms Ellis have been told they will not be able to hold a funeral for several weeks because any lawyers representing the potential killer could demand a second post-mortem examination. An inquest into the death of Ms Shakespeare, 17, is due to be opened and adjourned on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
