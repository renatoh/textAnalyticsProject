Since last month's US Open triumph Roddick's great ambition has been to take the top spot but its nearness has produced similar inhibitions to those which delayed his first grand slam for longer than expected. His thunderbolt serves were spasmodic and when the unseeded Chilean became pumped up after making some returns, the American looked numb and flat. A Roddick victory would have forced Juan Carlos Ferrero to reach this week's final to stay No1, but the loss left the Spaniard needing only to reach the semis. Last night Ferrero reaching the last eight with a 7-6, 7-6 win over his compatriot Felix Mantilla. Roddick's defeat was his first in 21 matches on the ATP Tour since losing to Tim Henman in the semi-finals at Washington in August. \"I didn't have my best stuff today,\" he said. \"He stepped up and played really well. I woke up this morning to learn I had come within a couple of inches of No1 [Ferrero had saved match points against Wayne Ferreira] but that's not something I can worry about too much: I am more concerned about what it will be at the end of the year.\" Roddick was serving for the first set at 5-3 when Massu began to gamble on which side his deliveries were going - and it worked. The South American then hurt Roddick with two more returns creating mini-breaks for 5-3 and 6-3 in the tie-break, and surged to the killer break of serve immediately at the start of the second set."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
