A reader also queried the location of Treen given for the Gurnard\u2019s Head, the pub suggested as a lunch stop on the walk. To clarify: it is in the hamlet of Treen, near Zennor, not to be confused with the larger village of Treen about 10 miles away as the crow flies. \u2022 In an interview with Madani Younis, artistic director of the Bush theatre (\u2018I want to provoke culture\u2019, 18 March, page 25), we said he was the \u201cfirst non-white director of any London theatre\u201d; though he has frequently been described in those and similar terms, other theatres in the capital, including the Arcola in Dalston and the venue run by Tara Arts in Earlsfield, had non-white directors before Younis\u2019s appointment at the Bush in 2012. \u2022 A picture accompanying a piece looking forward to next month\u2019s Champions League quarter-final matches was not of the footballer Paulo Dybala, as the caption said. It was of his Juventus team-mate Marko Pjaca (Who has the edge?, 18 March, page 7, Sport)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
