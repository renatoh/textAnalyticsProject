The bad news, however, is that this rout, with all due respect to Scotland whom they meet in a fortnight's time, might be their toughest test before the quarter-finals. That must be of concern, because as an illustration of men against boys - as opposed to group toddlers in Portugal and Romania - you will find few better examples in Test rugby than this mismatch in Marseille, which was over as a contest inside a stunning first quarter when New Zealand scored five unanswered tries. It could mean the All Blacks reach the knockout stages, where they will face the runners-up of the fiendishly difficult Pool D containing France, Ireland and Argentina, palpably undercooked. \"It's a possibility,\" said their coach, Graham Henry, \"and it's something we need to consider.\" And that will be done without his assistant, Steve Hansen, who is going home to be with his ill mother. It has also emerged that the New Zealanders are considering compassion when they meet Portugal in Lyon on Saturday in a match that threatens not just embarrassment to the competition but serious injury to the underpowered Portuguese. \"We'll think through what is our best policy and we will show some sensitivity, but not a huge amount,\" said Henry, who was satisfied enough with Saturday's performance. \"I thought our decision-making in the first 20 minutes was very precise.\" There also appeared a simmering desire to punish the Italians for going into a huddle and not casting a glance at the haka. \"It probably made us a little more angry,\" said the centre, Luke McAlister. \"That's their choice. The traditional thing is to stand up and respect it and by them not doing that it was pretty disrespectful.\" Considering McCaw scored within 64 seconds it is a move the Italians might re-evaluate in future. Under the consequent onslaught their defence was unable to cope with the New Zealanders' pace and ability to off-load out of the tackle, nor Dan Carter's clever chips behind their rush defence. That ploy produced two first-half tries and was pre-planned, according to Henry's backs coach, Wayne Smith. \"We'd done our analysis,\" Smith said, \"and decided it was an appropriate tactic. Having said that, the field just seemed to be too big for Dan [Carter]. \" Henry's only small dissatisfaction was that the \"set piece became a bit untidy in the second half\" but that can be excused, firstly because of the heat but also because of the premature lopsidedness of the scoreboard. Whether or not it was a worthwhile work-out will not be known until the quarter-final but at least it is a straw worth clutching for the rest of the world.
