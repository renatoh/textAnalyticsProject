It is one of the game's great sulks, which at least means he cares, and it did not get much better yesterday. The rumour that the England team for next week's first Test against New Zealand at Lord's has already been picked, rendering meaningless any of his efforts here, will not have escaped him. He also discovered that Geoff Miller, the national selector who was here to watch him bat on Thursday, was not here to see him bowl yesterday, having driven the best part of 250 miles to be at Andrew Flintoff's side at Old Trafford. The morning wires informed us that Hoggard was among the wickets. But the wires lied. He not only failed to take a wicket until he hit the tail with the second new ball late in the day but was roundly outbowled by Chris Tremlett, fast bowling's gentle giant, who achieved steepling bounce and looked too much for the New Zealand top order. The Yorkshireman huffed in from the pavilion end and he puffed in from the north end but he did not blow any specialist batsman's house down. Graham Onions looked sharper and Tremlett looked more dangerous. The Rose Bowl was warm and humid yesterday but the ball did not swing much for Hoggard and in these situations his weaponry is limited. It was Onions who took the first New Zealand wicket with his second ball. Jamie How was lbw to one that may have kept low. When Tremlett replaced Hoggard at the pavilion end James Marshall had difficulty getting his bat on the ball and when he finally played yet another rising delivery straight into the hands of Luke Wright at short-leg it looked like the shot of a tail-ender. Tremlett took his second wicket when Ross Taylor followed a wide, lifting delivery and did well to reach it, edging it for Matt Prior to take a diving catch behind the wicket. At lunch the New Zealanders were in some trouble at 69 for three. Brendon McCullum, in his most belligerent mood, looked capable of turning the game round for his side. But after he had scored 47 from 43 deliveries, with seven fours, he was run out. Aaron Redmond played the ball to midwicket and McCullum called him through for a single. Redmond said no but McCullum, fully committed, was run out by Michael Carberry's direct throw. He stomped back to the pavilion in a foul mood. Some people here would have liked to have seen McCullum run past Redmond and keep his wicket intact. When the opener was on 97 - and he was there for a long time - he edged Onions to Graeme Swann at first slip, who put down the simplest of chances. He finally reached his hundred when he pulled a long-hop from Adil Rashid through midwicket for four. He had batted five hours and faced 217 deliveries but it felt longer than that. He hit 17 fours. Redmond had made an unbeaten and career-best 139 when New Zealand closed the day on 261 for nine. By then Hoggard had nipped in with the cheap wickets of Jeetan Patel, Tim Southee and Iain O'Brien. But he still looked very cross."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
