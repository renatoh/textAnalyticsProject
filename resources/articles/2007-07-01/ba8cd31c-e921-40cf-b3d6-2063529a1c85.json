A lot can happen in a British summer. This year already we have seen a drought threatening in April, with the earth cracking open before the plants had closed over to provide summer cover, swiftly followed by flooding and gales with temperatures so cold that you could see your breath on the longest day, causing the tomatoes to stand still in their beds in protest, while in early July we had hail that lacerated the gardens of Clapham. It was like an apocalypse that evening, cycling home through drifts of ice and foliage in the gutters. There has been little of the kind of that perfect British weather that brings out the best in you and eclipses any memory of adversity in a morning, and the garden has responded as you might expect it to. Pushed around by wind when the plants were swollen, fat and contented, the geraniums were battered, the cardoons toppled. Slugs and snails have loved it and have grazed off more seedling lettuce this year than I care to think about. There has been less colour, too, the tagetes and nasturtium green and ready for the off, their buds pining for sun, still shut tight at the beginning of July. Of course, where one thing fails to perform as you want it to, another delivers in spades. This year, with as much water as they have needed, the Zantedeschias have never been taller, as tall as I am and luscious. Foliage has never been fuller, with the Vitis coignetiae growing leaves as big as tea trays, the fig much the same. The powdery mildew, so keen on the Banksian roses, failed to get the grip it usually does in a dry year, so they glistened like holly in winter sunshine. The Tetrapanax have to be seen to be believed, their parasols of foliage shedding the rain in torrents on to the pulmonarias underneath. It was foliage as I had dreamed it might be, as I had seen it in my mind's eye; the foil, the calming presence, the backdrop. But this year, despite the vagaries of the season, the silver shimmer provided by my Coyote willows was missing. I had a stand of them as the neutraliser to all the colour that is stacked up in the beds that precede them, and their foliage was as beautiful as a shoal of fish flitting in water. They had been there for the seven years and died, all three at once, in the eighth. I always think this is an interesting time frame, a seven-year itch, for it takes three years for a planting to mesh, to get its feet in, five for it to feel settled, and you have until about the seventh before you need to start making adjustments. The willows made the adjustment for me. I should have known that my willows were planning something, for they started to run in their fifth year, which is always a sign that the parent plant is sitting pretty and planning a family, or at least an advance on the world. Sometimes this is because a plant is greedy, other times because it is tiring and approaching a vulnerable period where youthful vigour is waning. Of course, I tried to imagine what the Coyote willow might do in the wild, where it lives on wide unsettled ribbons of boulder and sand at the bottom of North American valleys. I imagined the colony at the river's edge and knew that they were prone to suckering, but this being my first intimate, lengthy encounter with Salix exigua, I never imagined that suckering was an indication that the parent might just give up the ghost and move on. The prospect of the hole they left behind was far worse than the reality, but I have missed the silver they provided. Silver will relieve you on a dull day, because it captures all the light going and reflects it back at you. It is also the last thing to be lost to darkness, and when darkness does fall, it is silver that retains a luminosity with evening primroses in ghostly moonlight. Silver is a foil to colour during the day, the arbitrator between those colours that might not seem to go together. As a contrast to the greens, silver adds levity, which in a year such as this is also relief. The newly planted Pulmonaria 'Leopard' have done exactly this in an area that became increasingly darkened by the advance of the Tetrapanax in my garden. Your eye grew to know that it was best to pass over this hole, but now it prefers to linger, the spotted leaves of the lungwort sparkling there like light on water. Though there are pulmonarias that have been selected for their almost entirely pale foliage, I prefer the dappling of the spotted forms. Where the pulmonarias might succumb to powdery mildew in dry shade or a dry year, the newly introduced Brunnera 'Jack Frost' seems immune in these conditions, its rounded foliage almost entirely shot with silver. I have not tried it yet, for fear of it being too much of a good thing, but I might well team it up one day with Astelia chathamica 'Silver Spear' to bring levity to an area prone to gloominess. Silver plants that are good in shade are rare, since it is an adaptation that is more commonly associated with foliage that is designed to throw off sunlight in order to keep the plant cool. Olives are typical, as are many plants that have adapted to cope with the desiccation and heat of the Mediterranean. Lavender and sage, thyme and teucrium do this by covering themselves in a protective layer of tiny light-reflecting hairs, and to thrive in our damp climate they require plenty of light and air, free drainage, and ground that is low in nutrients. Feed them up and they become flabby and ultimately short lived, but give them the conditions they might favour on a Mediterranean hillside and they thrive. Everyone was making a big noise about these being the kind of plants that we were all needing to grow last year, with a drought and hosepipe bans, but who can really tell what is happening to the climate? If weather systems are changing, cool, wet weather seems as likely as a scorching heatwave. It is best to plant for all eventualities, so I plant those things that like free drainage where I have it, but opt for others that are more adaptable where the ground is more fertile. I recently planted a large border in Yorkshire to brighten a section of the garden there. This is a climate that could not be less Mediterranean, but there were plenty of options to relieve the dark stone walls and give an airiness to the garden. Elaeagnus angustifolia 'Quicksilver' provides the structure. You need at least the space of a double bed for this lovely deciduous shrub, as it likes to slob about, leaning on its elbows as it advances. At the beginning of June, the air about it is perfumed by tiny, almost insignificant flowers, and like silver poplars, the foliage is a life-giver on a big scale, throwing light back from a distance. To the foreground we have scattered the felty white Verbascum 'Arctic Summer', and it emerges as it seeds about biennially through a more constant undercurrent of green-grey Balotta pseudodictamnus. The star of the planting is the Cynara cardunculus, the cardoons that toppled in the wet and the wind this year. Free-standing in a more typical year, these are one of the most dramatic silvers you can invite into your garden. Starting early in a mild winter, the scrolled foliage piles on top of itself to mound more than a metre across before the flower spikes head skyward in June. Just now, these bolts of violet, as powerful as neon, are pulsing through the planting, resistant to moody skies and summer doldrums. dan.pearson@observer.co.uk For more regular updates on our allotment's progress, new films, pictures and slideshows, and to share your gardening comments, questions and advice, visit blogs.theguardian.com/allotment"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
