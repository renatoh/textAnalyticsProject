You find yourself swept away in a surprising and exciting romance which ends as quickly as it started. Then, at a moment of despair, another love comes along. Amid the renewed excitement commitments are made which, a few months down the line, appear a little rushed and rather too deep. Has Nick Clegg (ditched by the British people after a whirlwind romance during the excitement of last year's election television debates) undergone such a rollercoaster of emotions with David Cameron? Remember the Tory leader picked up the Lib Dem leader with his \"big, open and comprehensive offer\" just as Clegg licked his wounds after presiding over a fall in the number of Lib Dem MPs. The deputy prime minister told me today that he is preparing to embark on a new phase in his romance \u2013 sorry his partnership government in the national interest \u2013 with the prime minister. In phase one the two lovers \u2013 sorry leaders \u2013 hugged eachother close to prove they had formed a durable and credible relationship. Sorry, that should read coalition. But now they have shown they are serious, a slight chill appears to be entering the partnership. Clegg has said that the time has come to air differences in public: We are doing a lot of heavy lifting. We have to do that together in the first stages of this coalition government. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't from time to time remind people, if people need reminding, that we are, will be and always will be separate independent parties with separate identities. The deputy prime minister, who was speaking during his final visit to Oldham East and Saddleworth ahead of tomorrow's byelection, no doubt had in mind natural Lib Dem voters who may be thinking of defecting to Labour in protest at the cuts. But his remarks show that the Lib Dems have embarked on a bout of soul searching about their future in the coalition after an intense period of criticism in the wake of their U-turn over university tuition fees. The Lib Dems have found the first eight months of the coalition acutely painful for reasons which run deeper than a U-turn on tuition fees and a shift to the right on the fiscal deficit. The pain has arisen because Lib Dems have had to bite their tongues after Clegg issued two key decrees to his party: \u2022 Do not allow a cigaratte paper to come between the Lib Dems and Tories except in areas identified in the coalition agreement, such as Trident, where the parties agreed to disagree. Any signs of division would be seized on by critics of pluralistic politics who would then depict the Lib Dems as too immature to govern. \u2022 Take the credit \u2013 and blame \u2013 for all aspects of government policy, good and bad. This was designed to ensure that the Lib Dems could claim a share of the credit for the overall success of the government in 2015. If the Lib Dems only applauded the good bits, such as taking 900,000 people out of income tax, then it would be more difficult to associate themselves with what they hope will be a stabilisation of the public finances after tough measures. Clegg is moving on from the first decree but standing by the second. His new tactics appear to be designed to let voters know that the coalition is a marriage of convenience and not a whirlwind romance. Deep differences with the Tories, which were there from the beginning, will occasionally be aired in public now that the coalition has proved that it can govern in a stable way. Clegg insisted to me that this change of gear is entirely natural and was always part of his gameplan. But today's comments are significant for two reasons: \u2022 All junior coalition partners need to have a gritty edge to distinguish themselves from their senior partner. Vince Cable, who always made clear that he joined the coalition out of a sense of duty rather than any mission to remould British politics, provided that grit. But Cable is a much diminished figure after he was stripped of his media takeover powers following his admission that he had \"declared war\" on Rupert Murdoch. \u2022 Critics will say Clegg is backing away from what appeared to be an attempt last May to usher in a new era of co-operative politics, symbolished by his joint press conference in the Downing Street garden. This appeared to go deeper than a simple need to form a stable government in a hung parliament at a time of economic crisis. Rachel Sylvester highlighted the change in her Times column this morning. Sylvester wrote that Operation Hoover, in which the larger party sucks up its junior partner, could be replaced by Operation Detach. It is worth examining Clegg's words in detail. This is how he described the first phase of the coalition and the need to hug the Tories: I was always very clear, given that coalition government is a very alien concept in Britain, our early task, certainly in the first several months of this government, was simply to show that coalition government can work. Don't forget the dog that no longer barks is the accusation that coalition government doesn't work. If anything the accusation is that we are working too effectively. Eight months ago I was told coalition government couldn't possibly work, it would be a disaster, you never get any decisions. Now we are being accused that we take too many decisions, that we move too fast. Then Clegg gave an indication of the new phase: But of course over a five year parliament, and particularly towards the end when we start to prepare to campaign as separate independent parties again, people get a natural reassertion of the separate identities in the coalition. I think people have to be relaxed about these things. There are phases to this. We are doing a lot of heavy lifting. We have to do that together in the first stages of this coalition government. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't from time to time remind people, if people need reminding, that we are, will be and always will be separate independent parties with separate identities. This is what Clegg said about his disagreements with Cameron \u2013 and how he will be more open about them: You can co-operate together in a civilised and effective manner with people with whom you don't agree. David Cameron and I are leaders of two separate parties. Both of us are acutely aware of that. We are acutely aware that when we sit down every day dealing with difficult decisions together we start from the starting point that we don't fully agree. It is a strangely liberating thing. You actually sit down with people and say we don't agree, let's work out how we agree. If people want to hear a bit more about that process, or want to just know that that is a process that goes on, I'm very relaxed about that. Clegg insisted that he is still committed to a new era of pluralistic politics: I remain of the view that the prize of showing that new plural politics can work is an important strategic one. Ironically the one party that is now the small c conservative party of British politics, that wants to turn its back on any form of pluralism and wants to resort to very traditional, very cardboard cut out, very shrill tribalism is the Labour party. The deputy prime minister insisted he had always envisioned a change of gear: For me it's never changed. Any government \u2013 single government, coalition government \u2013 has to prove in the first early months that it can govern effectively. That is what we had to do. Then of course you have different phases in a government. We've made a lot of very controversial announcements over the last eight months. Both David Cameron and I were very deliberate about that. We said we've got to set out for the British people what our plan is for the next four or five years. Now we are moving into a different phase which is actually implementing a lot of those difficult decisions and continually arguing for the decisions we took in the first place. So we are entering as a government as a whole into a new phase in any event. And this was his message to Tory cabinet colleagues who have talked about holding a \"coupon election\" in which the Lib Dems and Tories would make deals over certain seats: I think people get far too complicated about this. We are in a coalition. We are not in a merger. We are two separate parties. This is a totally commonplace thing in so many other democracies around the world. It was the British people that decided no one had won the election. So we decided to co-operate and govern together in the national interest. That is the be all and end all of it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
