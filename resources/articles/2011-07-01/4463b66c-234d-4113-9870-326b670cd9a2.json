Less than a month ago, that past tense would have looked like a typographical error. This is far from the only investigation into Rupert Murdoch's enterprises under way, but is compulsory viewing for anybody gripped by this extraordinary scandal. While Murdoch is now as vulnerable as any emperor whose threadbare appearance has suddenly been widely noticed, he retains the capacity to bring a great deal down with him. Andrew Mueller Extreme Animal Attacks 2 8pm, Nat Geo Wild This does exactly what it says on the tin: bloody footage and reconstructions of attacks on man and beast alike by bears, crocodiles, vipers and sharks, as recounted by those who lived to tell the tale. These include an Australian surfer who offers the handy hint that the best way to fend off a shark is to punch it in the gills. There's also the tale of Louis, who spent an absorbing hour being mauled by a grizzly bear when it failed to occur to him to shin up a tree, as well as strangely satisfying footage of a tourist having her leg chewed by a polar bear at Alaska zoo. David Stubbs Show Me The Funny 9pm, ITV1 As well as a handful of decent gags, aspiring stand-ups need the fortitude to deal with a hostile crowd. So this week, the nine remaining hopefuls in this X-Factor of comedy receive two days' military training from the soldiers of Catterick Garrison, Yorkshire, before then trying to make them laugh. Sian Rowe Small Teen, Bigger World 9pm, BBC3 Jazz, who is just under four feet tall, is approaching her 17th birthday and asks her dad for a snake to make up for his absence for the first 16 years of her life. He's a recovering heroin addict and her mum talks to a blow-up doll she calls her boyfriend. \"I don't know how she's grown up so normal,\" says her mum. They go on holiday to Marrakech to repair their drifting relationship. It's more a show about the fledging of a teen and the reluctant empty-nester she's leaving behind than the story of their shared physical disability. Julia Raeside British Masters 9pm, BBC4 Suave art historian James Fox delivers another treatise on the British masters of the art world, this week exploring the cataclysmic effects of the second world war on the nation's collective psyche. The postwar period, and the hammer blow of the revelations emerging from the concentration camps of eastern Europe, made us realise what the human race was capable of, and as a result the work of artists such as the late Lucian Freud and Graham Sutherland took a turn towards the existential and, on occasion, the disturbing. Fox's presenting is insightful as always. Ben Arnold Coming Up: Micah 11.05pm, Channel 4 Channel 4's strand for emerging writers and directors continues with a film written by Levi David Addai about two brothers: the \"golden one\", Micah (Psychoville's Daniel Kaluuya), who is set to inherit their mother's house when she migrates to Nigeria, and Malachi (David Ajala), the black sheep who looks set to lose out because he's dating a Caribbean woman. It's efficiently directed by John Maidens and there are some nice touches of intergenerational divergence, but the story can't maintain the dramatic tension over 25 minutes, and the conclusion is all too obvious.
