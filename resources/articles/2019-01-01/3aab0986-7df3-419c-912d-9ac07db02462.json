Please do not read on if you are not up to date. What a cracking episode full of action, syphilitic passion, red-hot pokers and escapes across rooftops. And what a truly miserable place Paris is, full of people prostituting themselves, dying in the street and wearing off-the-shoulder rags that showcase their pockmarks. The interweaving of the strands was wonderful here, culminating in Pontmercy gazing at the pub sign representing his father\u2019s rescue and Javert chancing upon the one piece of the jigsaw that might lead him back to his prey. Meanwhile the political backdrop started to unfurl: \u201cParis is a tinderbox. It will only take a spark \u2026\u201d Screenwriter Andrew Davies has paced the story brilliantly across these six episodes. And with the magnificent distraction Dominic West\u2019s acting affords, it\u2019s easy to ignore some of the \u201cSay what?\u201d moments. Victor Hugo is a master storyteller, and Davies knows how to fillet that story into extremely compelling screen time. But, really, I stand by my claim that it should be called Les Coincidences instead of Les Mis\u00e9rables. Of all the boarding houses in Paris, of course Marius goes to the one run by the same Principal Tenant known to Cosette and Jean Valjean. And the child exiting the building Marius is about to move into must be the son of Thenardiers, the innkeeper who rescued Marius\u2019 father in battle, the same man who fostered Cosette. And the prostitute who attracts Marius must be Thenardiers\u2019 daughter \u2026 And they turn out to be his neighbours\u2026 And the police officer who happens to be on duty when Marius goes to the police station must be Javert \u2026 And so on\u2026 I\u2019m not complaining, or suggesting this is untrue to the original \u2013 these coincidences very much underpin the novel \u2013 but it is a reminder of the contradiction inherent in this kind of 19th-century classical literature. There is a heavy claim on \u201creality\u201d (that this is \u201ctrue to life\u201d, a portrayal of genuine injustice) and yet it is told through a meticulously constructed narrative that can only exist in fiction. \u201cHow do you live in this place?\u201d \u201cI live like this. I get what I can where I can.\u201d And we get to the point via whatever coincidences Hugo feels like including. Javert\u2019s refusal to give up the longest and lamest grudge in the history of humanity never ceases to amuse. No matter how many years pass, he never gives up searching for Valjean, the man who once stole a stale crust of bread and a teeny tiny penny. \u201cOne man out of hundreds. That was a decade ago. He could have been dead for years.\u201d But no, Javert hears Valjean laughing at him across the abyss of time. He must be brought to justice, even if it takes the best part of a century and about 1,900 pages. The action scene with Valjean branding himself with the hot poker was genius. Surely he\u2019s getting too old to escape through windows? And when will Javert remember that he too has seen these people before? The lighting in the 19th-century must have been terrible. Do people really struggle to recognise each other when they have such memorable faces? \u201cDid you recognise him? The one that took the girl \u2026\u201d Oh, never mind, let\u2019s do for \u2018im anyway. One complaint: no hair and teeth dealer this week. Favourite moment? \u201cLook through the peephole, Monsieur.\u201d Behold the lo-fi webcam of the age! No internet connection required: just a candle and a crack in the wall. Ah, those were the days. Least convincing romantic encounter Finally a proper love interest! But not for Eponine (nicely done by Erin Kellyman in a role I always think is poorly sketched) who does her best to attract Marius but puts him off with her exceedingly dirty feet. I\u2019m a big fan of Josh O\u2019Connor (Marius Pontmercy) and he really lit up this episode, portraying a mix of youthful defiance and noble morality. To the Poorly-Lit Place of the Lost Women with Greasy Faces and Messy Hair! \u201cFor you I make a special price!\u201d \u201cKiss it, you know you want to!\u201d Venereal disease and broken windows all round. Marius is as uncomfortable in this messy world as Valjean and it\u2019s important that we see him as a principled man who wants better things for himself and for others. O\u2019Connor nailed it in a look. The Gwyneth Paltrow onion for tears on demand The tenderness between Valjean (West) and Cosette (the meltingly beautiful Ellie Bamber) brought a tear to the eye. At first glance, Valjean can be a cheesy and unbelievable character: the hulking He-Man with the strength of a thousand men, the selflessness of Gandhi and the emotional intelligence of Oprah. But West brings something special that makes him feel real. In the relationship with Cosette, he shows that it is 99.9% innocent and perfect: he is the father she can trust, love and respect. But he injected it brilliantly with a barely perceptible soup\u00e7on of something more sinister. She is not really his daughter. He is not related to her. He is going to have to lose her. This was acting excellence. \u201cEcoutez et repetez!\u201d Classic miserable lines \u2022 \u201cThere is anger and unrest in the streets! What about that police officer, the one who came here \u2026\u201d Quelle memoire! I love that while people who had a vivid encounter 10 years ago can meet face-to-face and have absolutely no recollection, a nun who didn\u2019t even really see Javert on the dark night Cosette and Valjean came to the convent still remembers him about a decade later. \u2022 \u201cThat girl \u2026 I\u2019ve got a bad feeling about her \u2026\u201d Yes, Cosette, she is the one who was mean to you when you were little! (This is the one instance where I accept that, yes, it is unlikely that they would recognise each other.) \u2022 \u201cI think if I crossed paths with one of those men I would die, just from looking him in the face.\u201d Cosette completely misses the point of Valjean\u2019s lesson in empathy. \u2022 \u201cI have dedicated myself to pursuing not only the obvious offences, but the hidden ones.\u201d We get it, Javert. You\u2019re really not one to let bygones be bygones. \u2022 \u201cLies, violence, cruelty \u2026 That\u2019s the world.\u201d You said it, Valjean!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
