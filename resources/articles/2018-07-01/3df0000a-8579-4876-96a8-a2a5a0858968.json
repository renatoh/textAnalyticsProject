Asked if immigration was a \u201csleeper issue\u201d by the Q&amp;A host, Tony Jones, on Monday night, the resources minister and Queensland Liberal National party senator said he was worried that people who questioned immigration levels in Australia were \u201cmarginalised\u201d by the media. Canavan said his Italian grandparents had moved to the small Queensland town of Ayr when they came to Australia after the war, but now most of \u201cour migration gets concentrated in our major cities\u201d . \u201cAnd there is a certain ghettoisation in some aspects of this where there are just some parts of cities that are different cultures,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I want to maintain one culture in this country. We\u2019re multicultural, but we should have one culture we can get behind. \u201cI think it would be a lot better if we could spread our migration patterns around the country, perhaps, like we did do in the past.\u201d Canavan made his comments during a debate about immigration levels on a special \u201cpeople\u2019s panel\u201d edition of the program. The program featured four members of the public \u2013 an Indigenous lawyer, Teela Reid, a former police officer, Mitchell Walton, a recent graduate, Kumbi Gutsa and a marketing professional and Labor party member, Victoria Fielding \u2013 who auditioned to appear alongside Canavan and Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek. Plibersek questioned Canavan\u2019s use of the word \u201cghettoisation\u201d, noting that he had Italian heritage. \u201cLike Norton Street, Leichhardt, is that a ghetto? I mean it\u2019s a vibrant community,\u201d Plibersek said. \u201cIt\u2019s great. It\u2019s part of the great Australian tapestry,\u201d she said, referring to the Sydney suburb sometimes described as Little Italy. Canavan replied that what he was \u201cconcerned about is that today, particularly with the rise of extremist views in our community, they [ethnic groups] are concentrated in certain pockets of our major cities\u201d. \u201cLook at the actions that have been taken by intelligence authorities, that is very much concentrated in certain parts of our community and I worry they\u2019re getting closed off in the broader trends in Australia,\u201d he said. Walton, a small business owner and former Coalition supporter who was now considering voting for Cory Bernardi\u2019s Australian Conservatives, said \u201cimmigration was a bigger issue than the media gives it credit for\u201d. \u201cWe should have one, possibly two cultures. Our first Australians, and our western culture,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re based on.\u201d Noting Walton\u2019s concerns around unemployment and cost of living, Gutsa, whose father is from Zimbabwe, said migrants were \u201cusually blamed\u201d when economies were going through \u201cperiods of discontent\u201d. \u201cWe can see that in Trump\u2019s America at the moment, which I don\u2019t think Australia wants to become,\u201d he said. Reed, a Wiradjuri and Wailwan woman, appeared to find the whole discussion baffling. \u201cDon\u2019t get me started, the whole bloody country has immigrated or invaded,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to sit and watch the conversation unfold.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
