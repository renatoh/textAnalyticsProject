It was by no means a surprise. Campbell, aged 42 and probably the best known of the four artists shortlisted, had been the bookmakers\u2019 favourite all along to take a prize created 30 years ago to \u201cpromote discussion of new developments in contemporary British art\u201d. His film, It for Others, was first seen at the Scottish pavilion of the Venice Biennale in the summer of 2013. The Turner prize judges called it \u201can ambitious and complex film which rewards repeated viewing\u201d. They also \u201cadmired his exceptional dedication to making a work which speaks about the construction of value and meaning in ways that are topical and compelling\u201d. The film was inspired by a 1953 work by Alain Resnais and Chris Marker called Statues Also Die, which explored and lamented the colonial commercialisation of African art. Campbell\u2019s film widens the subject and has four episodes, one of which uses dancers from Michael Clark\u2019s company to explore economic theories and ideas in Karl Marx\u2019s Das Kapital. In another Campbell chronicles a 1971 IRA martyr image used today to brighten up Christmas stockings. In the opening segment there is a mild swipe at the British Museum \u2013 he was unable to use its Benin sculptures for his film \u2013 and the museum\u2019s director, Neil MacGregor, for being selective in his description of them. Campbell was chosen after a shorter than normal judging meeting \u2013 a reflection of consensus, said Penelope Curtis, the director of Tate Britain and chair of judges. \u201cAll the judges felt they were quite clear in their own minds.\u201d She added: \u201cThis is a work the judges have seen a number of times in different places and they felt it only gained by being seen again. They particularly liked the way it was shown here, so they felt it was finally done justice.\u201d It is undoubtedly a serious, challenging film, which added to its power, she said. \u201cIt has quite a rigorous journalistic approach, combined sometimes with mysterious forms.\u201d Accepting his prize, Campbell quoted WB Yeats who when told he was to receive the Nobel prize for literature, asked \u201chow much?\u201d \u201cI already know how much and this money will make a huge difference to me. Beyond that, even being nominated for the prize has given me great heart. The opinions of the people on the jury matter a great deal to me.\u201d Later Campbell said he would spend the money on \u201clife stuff \u2026 boring stuff. Rent and food and studio rent\u201d. He said the experience was \u201csurreal... it hasn\u2019t quite sunk in yet,\u201d but winning was good, it was a \u201cvalidation.\u201d Campbell was asked if he would like to follow the former Turner prize winner Steve McQueen into narrative film, working with the studios. \u201cMy experience so far is that there\u2019s a very particular way to make a film in that world and that\u2019s something I\u2019d need to have a think about. I wouldn\u2019t rule it in or out.\u201d Campbell was one of three artists making films in this year\u2019s prize and none of the four on the shortlist were big names outside the contemporary art world. The other shortlisted artists were Canadian-born printmaker Ciara Phillips, Tris Vonna-Michell, who made an autobiographical film called Finding Chopin: Dans l\u2019Essex, and James Richards, who made Rosebud, a film bearing the show\u2019s only content warning, which mingled monochrome images of a budgie on a chain, censored photos from Japanese library books and small flowers caressing a man\u2019s penis and sphincter. People love to hate the Turner prize, and there is inevitably some kind of talking point, whether that is Martin Creed winning for turning a light on and off, Tracey Emin submitting her unmade bed, or Chris Ofili spattering elephant dung on his canvases. This year the talking point was perhaps the lack of talking points. It was dull, said some. Or \u201cyawn-forcingly, heart-crushingly, buttock-clenchingly bad\u201d, according to Waldemar Januszczak in the Sunday Times, who urged people not to go. \u201cThe worst shortlist in the award\u2019s history,\u201d a critic for the Spectator chipped in. Certainly the comment boards outside the show have been overwhelmingly critical. \u201cRIP Art,\u201d complained one . Another was more positive: \u201cThe benches are comfy \u2013 thanks for the power nap!\u201d One critic, Laura Gascoigne, writing in Apollo magazine, complained that the prize is \u201cbeing decided by an international curatoriat reflecting the narrow tastes of an ersatz avant-garde, which, in the words of Grayson Perry, is \u2018talking to itself\u2019\u201d. What this year\u2019s shortlist undoubtedly reflected was the strength of the Scottish art scene, with Campbell, Phillips and Vonna-Michell all graduates of Glasgow School of Art. Campbell, Dublin-born and based in Glasgow, has many fans and admirers, and is known for strikingly original films, which have included portraits of Bernadette Devlin and John DeLorean. He asks big questions, but does not claim to have the answers. The \u00a325,000 award was presented by the actor Chiwetel Ejiofor at a dinner at Tate Britain, marking the return of the ceremony to London after its sojourn to Derry last year. Next year it will be staged in Scotland for the first time , with the Tramway in Glasgow playing host. The judging panel, chaired by Curtis, also included Stefan Kalmar, the executive director of Artists Space, New York; Helen Legg, the director of Spike Island in Bristol; Sarah McCrory, the director of the Glasgow International biennial; and Dirk Snauwaert, the artistic director of the Wiels contemporary art centre in Brussels."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
