Wolverhampton Wanderers had just lost their fifth home game in succession, have won only one of their past 14 in the Premier League, and are a Championship team in all but name. Connor, their L\u2011plated manager, is plainly out of his depth and the board clearly boobed by sacking Mick McCarthy a month ago without a decent replacement to hand. The fans, feeling betrayed by a potentially catastrophic mistake, vented their spleen before and after the dismal performance on Saturday when the club's owner, Steve Morgan, and the chief executive, Jez Moxey, had to run the gauntlet with police protection. The players, too, were abused, to which Jamie O'Hara tweeted his objection. It is a sad state of affairs for erstwhile giants of the domestic game, who are learning the hard way that promoting from within hardly ever works \u2013 largely because most managers employ assistants who pose no threat to their tenure. Blackburn Rovers' Steve Kean may yet prove to be an exception, but the Ewood jury is still out on him, despite their team's revival, and the supporters prefer to chant the name of their late, lamented patron, Jack Walker. Verbally, at least, Kean continues to get no credit, which seems a bit harsh in the context of 15 points taken from the past 10 matches and that away win against Manchester United. Rovers were good value for this latest success, and would have won by a thumping margin if Yakubu Ayegbeni's radar had not suffered a rare malfunction. With more accuracy the cruiserweight striker would have added at least a couple to his impressive tally of 13 goals in 20 Premier League appearances. Wolves, in Connor's first home game in charge, were just as bad as they had been the previous week in losing 5-0 at Fulham and in their previous home game, when they were thrashed 5-1 by West Bromwich Albion. Disorganised in defence and dispirited everywhere, they are going nowhere but down under the present hapless regime and, with a new stand to pay for, a fire sale of players seems inevitable come the end of the season. On a more positive note, rough diamonds are occasionally to be found amid the dross of relegation warfare and Blackburn have one in Junior Hoilett, a pacy, clever winger whose dexterity on the ball is attracting interest from the top clubs. Canadian born, but a Rovers player since the age of 13, this gifted 21-year-old scored both goals on Saturday, each finished with consummate expertise, first with his right foot and then with his left. Unfortunately for Kean, the young man's contract expires at the end of the season, when he will be moving onwards and upwards, regardless of his present employers' status. Refusing to accept the inevitable, Kean said: \"I hope we don't lose Junior and we've not given up on that because he is a special player.\" Wolves face Manchester United next Sunday, then Arsenal and Manchester City in April, and Connor was whistling in the dark when he said: \"We spoke about the situation after the game and we still believe we are good enough to get out of trouble. One result doesn't break a season and we'll continue to compete.\" Continue? Starting would be nice for those suffering old gold supporters.
