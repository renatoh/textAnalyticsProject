It quietly rejected advice from the independent Health and Safety Commission for a legal code forcing all employers either to ban smoking or take stringent other measures to protect staff from second-hand smoke. Ministers told the watchdog to redraft proposals giv ing more ground to the hospitality industry - which complained that it would either have to stop customers lighting up or take expensive steps to protect bar staff and waiters - and examining the use of voluntary agreements. The move delays any chance of a passive-smoking crackdown, angering the anti-tobacco lobby and irritating senior figures at the HSC. Although a code will still be produced, campaigners fear it will be so watered down as to be barely worth it. 'If the Government have given into the pressure then I am extremely disappointed,' said Labour peeress Baroness Gibson, who sat on the committee that drafted the original code. 'It certainly undermines their strategy. If you are trying to get an anti-smoking policy in offices and places like that, if the minute you leave the office and go to the pub or out for a meal there isn't a smoking ban, your health is being endangered.' She said there had been 'heavy lobbying' from the leisure industry and the HSC had already made compromises in its first draft. 'I think that the leisure industry is being extremely selfish, it is endangering people's health,' she said. Unveiled last September, the code would have forced employers to take action either by banning smoking; or segregating smokers by, for example, creating special rooms for them; or if this was impracticable, by installing better ventilation, or changing shifts to reduce the time staff were exposed to smoking customers. Firms that took insufficient action would have faced prosecution and heavy fines. Studies have repeatedly shown links between inhaling secondhand smoke and heart disease, lung cancer, and stroke as well as cot death in babies. Hundreds of people die prematurely every year from passive smoking-related illness. The HSC was originally asked to produce a code in 1998, under the then Health Secretary Frank Dobson's anti-smoking strategy which promised a significant 'toughening of measures' against passive smoking. The HSC will now consider other options including creating separate rules for pubs and restaurants. Anti-smoking campaigners say that is not enough. 'The original code was perfectly sensible, perfectly sound, and there is no reason at all for them to do this,' said Clive Bates, of the pressure group Action on Smoking and Health. An HSC spokeswoman said the new proposals needed to 'strike the right balance' between small business and staff welfare. The news comes within days of the Government granting a fresh concession to the tobacco industry. Cigarette manufacturers are expected to be given an extra two years to comply with an European Union-wide agreement reducing tar levels in products made for export."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
