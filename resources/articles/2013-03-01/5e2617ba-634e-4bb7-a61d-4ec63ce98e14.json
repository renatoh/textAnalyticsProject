A number of the Tigers' returning internationals had to fight off midweek illness as well as their intense post-Cardiff disappointment, making a gritty victory immensely satisfying. \"After 10 minutes we felt like we'd already played 70,\" said Ben Youngs. \"Last week was really tough for everyone, mentally and physically.\" While Leicester have long specialised in mind-over-matter displays, few have been chiselled from bleaker beginnings. For Youngs and his colleagues this was as much about improving Leicester's chances of a home semi-final as rebuilding the self-respect which took such a hammering in Wales. \"The best thing to do after a game like last week is to get back on the horse,\" said Youngs. \"Every single one of us agreed we had to focus on Exeter and put what happened in Cardiff to bed. We were laughing on the way in because it was a slightly different atmosphere. It was quite nice running out, not nearly as nerve-racking.\" Youngs confessed he had deleted his recording of the Wales game at the earliest possible opportunity but looked far happier here, despite the inevitable post-Six Nations rustiness in a Tigers side which again suffered from more Test calls than most. There is no immediate let-up in prospect, with a trip to Northampton this weekend followed by a daunting European quarter-final in Toulon. Win both those two fixtures and the pain of the Millennium Stadium really will be history. It will put intense demands on their bodies with Dan Cole, in particular, having already played a lot of rugby this season. Refereeing concerns also linger, with Tim Wigglesworth opting to reset several scrums which should have been penalised, prompting further debate about an aspect of the game trying everyone's patience. Richard Cockerill, the Leicester director of rugby, has proposed stopping the match clock until the ball emerges from the scrum, a good idea with one fatal flaw. Four-hour games of rugby are not really the way forward. Cockerill believes care has to be taken not to downgrade the significance of the scrum in a subjective pursuit of entertainment. \"What I don't want is people who don't understand the scrum telling us how it should be refereed. For me every sport is about the participants first and foremost. If you want entertainment, go to the theatre,\" said Cockerill. \"The International Rugby Board's mandate is to promote a game for all shapes and sizes. You will take those out of the game if you start tinkering too much. If you turn everyone into 6ft 2in back-rowers we'll end up with a 15-man version of rugby league. For me there's a fair bit of beauty in a quality scrum. It ain't basketball, it ain't razzmatazz.\" The Chiefs were left bemoaning another narrow Premiership reverse, their fifth of the season by five points or fewer, after Gareth Steenson's last-minute penalty attempt from 45 metres dropped fractionally short. Four Toby Flood penalties ultimately did the job, Mathew Tait having butchered the game's best try-scoring opportunity by cutting inside and ignoring a 3-1 overlap. Cockerill, who hopes Steve Mafi will return this weekend, was not overly concerned. \"Sometimes you just have to rely on their willpower. Were we lucky to win? That's the game sometimes.\" The Exeter head coach, Rob Baxter, has not given up on Heineken Cup qualification for next season and suggested the outcome could have been very different had his team not rushed into two ill-fated tap penalties when more composure would have served them better. He made a point, however, of saluting Leicester's mental steel \u2013 \"They showed why they're a top-four side\" \u2013 and Youngs reckons there is better to come. \"I shouldn't think it was a joy to watch but it was all about kicking, chasing and working hard. We know we'll be a better side next week than we showed here.\" Exeter Arscott; Nowell, Dollman (Whitten, 39), Shoemark, Jess; Steenson, Thomas (Chudley, 56); Rimmer (Sturgess, 65), Yeandle (Whitehead, 65), Tui (Mitchell, 73), Mumm (Hanks, 65), Welch, Ewers, White (Horstmann, 56), Baxter (capt).
