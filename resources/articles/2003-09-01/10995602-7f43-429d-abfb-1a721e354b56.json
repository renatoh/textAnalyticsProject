Despite initial fears that Scholes would require his third operation on a recurrent hernia problem, the injury appears to have healed in the month since his last game. He has trained all week and if everything goes according to plan he should be in the squad when United travel to Germany. And, even if it is too great a risk to include him at the start next Wednesday, he should be in contention for a full 90 minutes against Birmingham at Old Trafford the following Saturday. But Sven-Goran Eriksson is aware he still has a minefield to negotiate in persuading United to release Scholes for the Euro 2004 qualifier in Istanbul on October 11, and that his occasionally fractious relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson might be tested again. Even if Scholes is back playing, Ferguson will be loth to risk aggravating the problem while on international duty, particularly as United's manager blames England's friendly against Croatia for leaving the midfielder unable to play in the first place. Ferguson says the club will have to \"adopt a softly, softly approach\" to minimise the risk of the 28-year-old suffering a relapse. Eriksson will have the power, if necessary, to insist that Scholes is inspected by England's medical staff but that would be a last resort. Fresh attempts to involve Eriksson in peace initiatives before England's game in Turkey will be made today, but the chance of success appears bleak. Senior Football Association officials are expected to raise the possibility of a goodwill trip by Eriksson to Istanbul when they meet Turkish counterparts in a summit at Uefa's Swiss headquarters. The idea would be for Eriksson and Turkey's coach Senol Gunes to hold a joint press conference appealing for calm during. England need to avoid defeat to make next summer's finals in Portugal. But the Turkish football federation has already turned down an offer for Gunes to attend a similar conference in Switzerland today and Uefa will not pressure them to change tack. The summit was called by Uefa after public statements about the match sent tensions surrounding the game soaring. Eriksson warned England fans that \"they could be killed\" if they went to Istanbul and the Turkish federation president Haluk Ulusoy retorted that Eriksson \"has forgotten the Heysel disaster. Of course he doesn't want England fans in Turkey because he doesn't want them to see a defeat.\" The meeting will be chaired by Uefa's chief executive Gerhard Aigner, with communications director Mike Lee and security expert Marc Timmer also in attendance. Lee said: \"This meeting is a follow-up to the one held with the two FAs earlier in the summer. It's an opportunity for us to be fully updated on the preparations that have been made for this game. \"The main focus will be safety, security, policing and ticketing issues, and we will want to emphasise the importance of the right approach being taken to the build-up, both privately and publicly.\" The FA delegation will be led by the chairman Geoff Thompson with director of football affairs David Davies, marketing director Paul Barber and security officer Ray Whitworth also there. The Turkish party is similar and led by Ulusoy, who did not attend the previous meeting in July. More trouble at the Sukru Saracoglu stadium, venue for England's tie, has seen Fenerbahce given a one-match home ban with the league game in question switched to Izmir. Fans threw coins, plastic bottles and umbrellas on to the pitch despite warnings from the referee in a match two weeks ago against Gaziantepspor, a federation disciplinary official said on condition of anonymity. Only last month Fenerbahce were ordered to play one game behind closed doors after dozens of fans were injured in a brawl during a match against Trabzonspor at the Sukru Saracoglu. England have moved up two rungs in the latest Fifa world rankings, above Holland and Turkey. Eriksson's side are sixth after recent wins over Macedonia and Liechtenstein. Turkey have slipped to eighth and the Dutch by three places. Brazil, France and Spain remain the top trio, in that order."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
