Among the odd reasons he gave was that people were smoking on the street corner (definitely one of the best bits when I was there). It was another reminder of the importance of the \"school gate\" issue when it comes to choice of secondary school. In many cases this just translates as race and class and \"can we face having our children educated with rough kids who are not like ours\", but for some parents it is a genuine fear that their own child won't be safe in school. Is this an urban myth or reality? The tragic fatal stabbing of Luke Walmsley in rural Lincolnshire showed what can happen when incidents spiral out of control, but equally that wasn't a tough inner-city school and incidents like that and the death of headteacher Philip Lawrence are rare. Most schools are calm and orderly places with behaviour policies that work, and no guns or knives. However, say teachers all over the country, and anyone who has sat on a permanent exclusion panel, the increased violence in society is seeping into schools, especially in disadvantaged areas. I recently met two headteachers who regularly patrol with walkie-talkies outside their schools and another who rather quaintly goes out on his bike in a very tough part of London. In short, an urban myth with the reality being eternal vigilance in a world where schools are expected to solve so many of the shortcomings of society. But in the end perception is everything. Many parents will feel that the walkie-talkie patrol or a regular police presence in a school is reassuring; others will see it as a terrifying confirmation that socially mixed schools are really snake pits into which their child is being hurled. But there is a deeper issue about how we view and deal with teenagers. The anxious pang when you look at your fresh-faced 11-year-old and contemplate him or her surrounded by great big hooded loutish youths (gender is up there with race and class in a lot of parents' minds) is understandable. But all our kids become teenagers, even the posh ones (although, interestingly, when the boys at a local private school ran amok at the end of term it was dismissed as PG Wodehouse-ish high jinks rather than the further evidence of social disintegration it would have been in the state sector). At the risk of sounding like a potty lifestyle guru, we need a more holistic approach to teenagers. As a nation we don't like them very much. We don't give them anything to do; we don't listen to them; sports and arts facilities in many areas are pitiful; they can't go into pubs and clubs without fake ID, whereas in other continental countries they could happily sit in bar and enjoy a drink or a cup of coffee and probably end up with a much more mature attitude to alcohol. While individual teachers often perform miracles in dealing with turbulent teenage emotional and self-esteem issues, that work isn't really supported by the wider community in the way it might be with better facilities for young people. Then we wonder why they end up looking bored or threatening and hanging around the school gate, or, shock horror, smoking on street corners. So much public policy is rightly geared to the early years, but very little is aimed at supporting (rather than punishing) adolescents - or indeed their parents. It may be that pushing children less academically in their early years and allowing them to develop emotionally and socially first would reap huge benefits in both social and academic development later on. Read the Ofsted report comparing England, Denmark and (top achieving country in the world) Finland if you want to be convinced of that. A more flexible 14-19 curriculum, extended schools and the proposals in the new children's green paper should make a difference, but only with huge dollops of cash and very tight local planning. One final thought. Whose child is really unsafe in the school with the \"gate\" issue: the one who goes home to the nice, welcoming, warm home with loving parents who happily ferry their offspring around by car, or the one who doesn't and whose out of school life revolves around the street corner? I think I know the answer to that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
