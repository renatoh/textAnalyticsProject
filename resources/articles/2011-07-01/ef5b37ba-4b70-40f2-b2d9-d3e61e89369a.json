It is understood that the Championship club would be willing to let Foster \u2013 one of their highest-earners and most valuable assets \u2013 go on a season-long loan for a \u00a31m fee on the basis that the deal would become permanent if Birmingham fail to regain top-flight status at the first attempt. West Bromwich Albion and Newcastle United have been scouring the market for a goalkeeper and weighing up the merits of West Ham United's Rob Green, but the prospect of signing Foster is likely to appeal. The 28-year-old, who said towards the end of last season that he wanted to take an indefinite break from international football, was one of Birmingham's most consistent players last term, rebuilding his reputation after losing his way at Manchester United, where he had been tipped to succeed Edwin van der Sar. Birmingham have slashed their outgoings in the wake of relegation, with Barry Ferguson the latest high-profile player set to leave the club. The Scot is on the verge of completing a \u00a3600,000 move to Blackpool where he would link up with Kevin Phillips, a former Birmingham team-mate. The departures of Roger Johnson and Craig Gardner, to Wolverhampton and Sunderland respectively, have brought in more than \u00a311m and it remains likely that Cameron Jerome, Scott Dann and Nikola Zigic will also move on before the transfer window closes. West Brom will hold talks with Owen Hargreaves next week with a view to signing the midfielder on a free transfer. Hargreaves is without a club after he was released by Manchester United at the end of last season following four injury-plagued years at Old Trafford. Several clubs, including Leicester City, have expressed an interest in the former England international but Albion were the first to make contact and are optimistic about their chances of signing him. Leicester's manager, Sven-Goran Eriksson, gave Hargreaves his debut when he was in charge of the England team."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
