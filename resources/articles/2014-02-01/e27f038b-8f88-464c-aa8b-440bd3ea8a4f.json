They have been drawn by residents scoring the progress of floodwaters through their homes over what has been the wettest month since records began and is heading towards being the wettest winter Britain has seen in 100 years. On Christmas Eve, this Domesday Book Kent village was deluged by riverwater and sewage that swirled close to two metres high in places, swallowing cars, dislodging sheds and climbing the stairs of Kevin Fox's townhouse into his family's first-floor kitchen. \"We got a lot of stuff upstairs when we knew it was coming,\" he said. \"Worse things have happened to people, there's a lot worse off than us. But it wasn't much fun. We didn't have a Christmas.\" His chalk lines are on both the inside and the outside of the house. The fridge and cooker stand water-damaged and useless, the floor tiles are deeply cracked and the walls yellowed with the tidemark of floodwater. The waters receded and the family is still living here for now, cooking on a gas-powered barbecue, but with life jackets hanging on the coat pegs in the hallway. All the neighbours lucky enough to have picked sympathetic insurance companies have moved out to temporary accommodation with only a few families remaining. Across the street Matt Miller wasn't covered for the damage to his cottage and he is still trying to dry it out himself. \"No choice. It'll take at least another month just to clean up,\" he said. But even as he works, the sandbags are back stacked against the door of his waterlogged kitchen while Fox has donned his hi-vis jacket and is again out with flood volunteers. The incessant rain has brought the teeming brown waters swirling again far outside the banks of the River Beult and around Yalding's streets and outlying fields, lapping at the bottom of Fox's garden. His stepson George, 11, is worried about the chickens. \"At Christmas we brought them upstairs but their house was ruined; someone else I know lost their chickens, they drowned.\" Like many rural areas hit by this winter of wet, residents want flood defences. Parish councillor Geraldine Brown was among those who drew up the village's own emergency plan after flooding in 2000 and the council is now calling for more flood protection. She estimates it will cost \u00a325m for flood defences on the Beult and the same again to raise the local reservoir by a metre. With demand for more flood defence spending coming from communities from Cornwall to Wales, the Midlands to western Scotland and Northern Ireland, quite apart from the floodplains of the Somerset Levels and the entire east coast that's losing 8mm to the sea year on year, it seems unlikely the money will be forthcoming. This government cut the Labour government's spending on flood defences to \u00a32.34bn, down from \u00a32.37bn, while 15% reductions in the Environment Agency's staffing have been announced \u2013 with the loss of 550 staff working on flood maintenance and preparation. Figures show that 4,000 homes have been built on flood plains, against Environment Agency advice, in the last five years, and now the agency's ability to offer advice to local authorities on such building has been drastically curtailed with the onus now on developers to carry out such assessments. In 2010 communities secretary Eric Pickles scrapped the obligation on councils to prepare for how climate change could affect their residents, while the UK is far behind targets on coastal realignment \u2013 including the restoration of salt marshes \u2013 intended to keep pace with rising sea levels and tidal flooding. In January the government's committee on climate change said spending on flood defence was \u00a3750m below the sum needed to keep risks from flooding at current levels. \"Flood defences deliver fantastic value for money. But \u2026 the cuts imposed mean floods will happen that could be cost effectively avoided.\" The committee concluded: \"Not enough is being spent and we can expect the number of households at flood risk and damages from flood events to be on the increase.\" Craig Woolhouse, head of flood incident management at the Environment Agency, admitted that budgets meant smaller communities might have to accept they were past saving \u2013 unless they could raise the money to defend themselves. On Thursday, after a month of floodwater cutting off farms and villages in the Somerset Levels, David Cameron announced that the Ministry of Defence would be sending in army equipment and manpower to deliver food, transport people and distribue sandbags. But that decision was attacked as too little as this weekend several severe flood warnings were in force across Cornwall and Devon with dozens of less severe warnings for parts of the Midlands. Environmental campaigners are finding their decades of gloomy warnings on climate change coming to pass. In the runup to the deadline for the government's review into the nation's preparedness for flooding, which the PM has said will be published by the end of the month, the Planning and Climate Change Coalition, a cross-sector group of organisations led by the Town and Country Planning Association, sent an open letter to the prime minister. It urged him to ensure that the review recognises the connection between climate change and extreme weather as well as the role of planning and good design in creating resilient communities. It pleaded for the cuts to the Environment Agency to be reversed. Dr Hugh Ellis, the association's head of policy, told the Observer that missed opportunities meant flooding was now a fact of British life, thanks to governments ignoring clear scientific advice. He delivered a blistering attack on the inaction of politicians and the conservatism of many scientists. \"I'm not party political, but I am opposed to a government that doesn't govern. They well understand they have a problem, they have done for a long time, yet they refuse to acknowledge it. Instead they abolish the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution and slash the EA; it's like saying I don't like the rain, so I will abolish weather forecasts. \"Where is the national plan? The vulnerable east coast that we already know is disappearing into the sea year on year has 30 different authorities from the Humber to the Thames \u2013 do we just hope they all get together and do something? \u2026 It's truly the age of stupid, its like that scene in Jaws where the mayor is walking along the beach telling people there's no shark just because he doesn't want to lose the tourists.\" He said the economic interests of places like Hull and Boston, Lincolnshire, were already blighted by their flood vulnerability. The devastating 2007 floods in England cost the UK economy \u00a33bn. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated flooding in the summer of 2012 was likely to cost insurers \u00a3500m, with the overall cost of flooding to insurers for the year estimated at \u00a31bn. PwC has suggested the current floods will cost insurers \u00a3400m, but there are other costs \u2013 to the emergency services, to ordinary people's lives and livelihoods, as well as lost farming land and devalued property. But the EA says it has been working flat out, not only in clearing rivers of debris and keeping pumping stations and barriers working, but also with its predictions. \"We'll have staff on 24-hour standby this weekend. We have alerts up and will be issuing warnings and liaising with emergency services,\" said Craig Woolhouse. \"Should climate change really come to fruition it may be lesser, or be worse than predicted. We don't want to over-invest up front, but take an adaptive approach so if we build a barrier we can come back and build it higher in 10 years' time if need be. \"The answer isn't always a Thames barrier or dredging a river. Neither is the panacea. There's no magic bullet that stops it raining. Extreme weather brings consequences.\" He pointed to the fact that the 2013 storm surge on the east coast had affected 2,000 properties while flood defences had protected 80,000. \"It's a long, hard job.\" In Kent this weekend, the maze of B-roads is peppered with flood signs and road closures. Kevin Fox is manning the yellow barricades in Yalding with fellow volunteers, helping diverted drivers and delivery trucks navigate their way around the floods. \"It is a bit of a ghost town down in this part of the village, a lot have moved out. We'll be moving out soon too. But temporarily. I love my house and I'm not losing it. It was only built 20 years ago and supposed to be flood-proof.\" He points down the road where a field is submerged, a vast sheen of water as far as the eye can see. \"They've been talking about building houses down there. It's a reservoir they need. I'm coming back to my house, though, we'll just have to take our chances,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
