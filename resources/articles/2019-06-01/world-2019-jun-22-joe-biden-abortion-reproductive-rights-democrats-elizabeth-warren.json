In fact, his record on the subject is mixed, as a question to the former vice-president suggested. \u201cWell, first of all, I\u2019m not sure about the mixed record part. I\u2019ve had 100% voting record,\u201d Biden said, before his microphone cut out. When it came back on, he had moved on to healthcare. Biden, a Catholic and a Delaware senator for 36 years, has gone back and forth on support for abortion access. In this election cycle, reproductive rights has emerged as a top issue as Republican statehouses across the US have attacked abortion rights. Biden told his audience in Columbia he would codify the right to an abortion, granted in Roe v Wade, into law \u201cas defined by Casey\u201d \u2013 a stance more conservative than those of many other Democratic candidates present. Casey is the 1992 supreme court decision which allowed states to severely restrict abortion access, including imposing waiting periods and medically unnecessary administrative burdens. Later in the forum, a woman who said she was sexually assaulted by her abusive husband but could not cover an abortion through her military health benefits, asked Biden how he would expand access to abortion. \u201cA lot of you women, maybe a lot of men out here, maybe don\u2019t realize what incredible courage it took to stand up and say that,\u201d Biden said. Other candidates went further. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on defense for 47 years, and it\u2019s not working,\u201d said the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. \u201cAn inch at a time, a piece at a time, they\u2019ve chipped away, hacked away at the ground under our feet, so access becomes narrower, becomes more limited. She went on: \u201cThis is a democracy. In a democracy, the laws should reflect the values of the people. So I say it is time to go on offense with Roe v Wade. It\u2019s not enough to say we\u2019re going to rely on the courts. We need to pass a federal law to make Roe v Wade the rule of the land.\u201d That prompted huge cheers. She continued: \u201cWe can add and say: no more of this semi-repeal of Roe, another bite out of Roe, an undercut of Roe. We\u2019re going to make it the law. Let\u2019s make it the law for real again.\u201d But the loudest cheers of the day went to Cory Booker, who called bans passed by states like Alabama a violation of human rights. \u201cIf they come for you in the morning, they come for me at night. This election is about winning,\u201d said Booker, as he stepped off the stage, the only candidate to do so. \u201cThis election is about women! This election is about minorities! This election is about all of us and that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to fight. This election is about liberty and justice for all and we will win!\u201d The audience presented a sea of pink Planned Parenthood shirts. Some were moved to tears. In a bathroom, a woman cried as she said she had \u201cnever been to an event like this, and it is so powerful. I want to travel the country.\u201d The woman said she had an abortion at a Planned Parenthood facility in 1974, when she was 16. Her mother had been with her. \u201cI was able to have an abortion,\u201d she said, \u201cgo to college, meet my soon-to-be husband, and have a life of my choice.\u201d She did not say her name, because her family did not know her story. On stage, each candidate was given about 10 minutes to answer questions from Planned Parenthood leaders and an audience member. Shocking stories came forth. One audience member told the New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand that she threw herself down the stairs, drank until she vomited, took hot baths and even rode every ride at a county fair to try to induce an abortion. She was forced to carry the unwanted pregnancy to term, she said, because she lacked the roughly $600 in cash needed to pay for an abortion. \u201cI have a beautiful child I love and adore,\u201d said Laurie Bertram Roberts, now a doula. \u201cThat does not mean I am grateful for the trauma I was put through for the fact the Hyde amendment exists.\u201d That was a reference to a provision of federal law that prevents the government from paying for abortion and primarily affects 17 million poor and disabled women who rely on Medicaid. Gillibrand became tearful herself. She told the audience not to vote for her but to \u201cpick your top five\u201d candidates, and donate. \u201cIf women and candidates of color are not included on that debate stage in September, October, you will not be represented,\u201d said Gillibrand. Over the past few months, Republicans and conservative Christians have worked to severely limit abortions rights. Bans have passed in states including Ohio and Kentucky. The laws are patently unconstitutional and abortion remains safe and legal in all 50 states. But supporters hope the bans will be challenged all the way to the supreme court, where the conservative-leaning majority could reconsider Roe v Wade. Social conservatives have also attempted to make abortion inaccessible through administrative means. This week, political appointees in Missouri attempted to shut down the state\u2019s last abortion clinic and a federal court decided in favor of the Trump administration allowing federal funding to go to clinics which do not offer comprehensive family planning services. The South Carolina event was organized in response to such Republican moves. It had the air of a party \u2013 a DJ blasted Lizzo from the speakers \u2013 but one whose attendees were frankly fed up. For at least some candidates, this presented a challenge. The former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper stumbled through a short history of his life in the restaurant industry before saying he could oversee a \u201cmagnificent expansion of Title X\u201d federal funding for family planning. Planned Parenthood president Dr Leana Wen told the Guardian her group is \u201cworking with all the candidates to develop the most proactive policies that would protect women\u2019s health and rights\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
