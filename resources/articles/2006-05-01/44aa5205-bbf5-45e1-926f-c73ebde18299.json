Can you recommend a red wine that might be better for me? This is a common reaction to wine - women in particular get symptoms such as yours, redness around the eyes or headaches. It might be a reaction to the alcohol content, or pesticides used, but is most likely due to the sulphur (commonly in the form of sulphur dioxide) that is added to all wines to halt the fermentation process. A full-bodied wine such as a shiraz will also have more tannins and grape skins. To find a therapist who could test you for allergenic substances, visit allergy.org.uk. Many people find that good-quality organic wines do not cause a reaction - this may be because they contain less sulphur, and lack pesticide and fungicide residues. Vintage Roots (0800 980 4992, vintageroots.co.uk) stocks a wide range of organic wines - particularly low in sulphur are the Loire Valley Cabernet Franc 2004 (\u00a35.99) and Chianti San Donato a Lucardo 2004 (\u00a36.75). I was recently given an electric blanket. My mum told me not to have it on all night because it will dry my bone marrow. Is this true? There are many concerns about the ill-effects of electric blankets, but I have never heard anything relating to bone marrow. You should never leave an electric blanket on overnight, because of the fire risk. Aside from this, dangers are thought to stem from the fact that we ourselves produce an electromagnetic field and any electrical device that produces its own field - such as electric blankets, phones and computers - may clash with and disrupt our energy. Many natural therapies, such as homeopathy, acupuncture, chiropractic, flower remedies and healing, aim to improve health holistically by enabling the body's vital energy to flow undisturbed. So electrical devices that might put one's energy out of balance are thought to hamper the body's own healing ability and to interfere with normal body functions such as cell division - though this has not been proven. In any case, it is recommended that you use an electric blanket simply to warm the bed before sleeping and switch it off as soon as you get in. Emma Mitchell is a natural health therapist. Before following Emma's recommendations, you should consult your GP about any medical problems or special health conditions.
