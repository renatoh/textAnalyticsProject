Maybe the UK", "bodyText": "Of all the destructions of the dismal decade, history will surely judge the deliberate downgrading of children the most perverse. \u201cOur children are our future\u201d used to be a tired old bromide trotted out by every politician, but if you look at spending, you would say the old have been the future for the Conservatives. What does it say about Britain that the old took priority with triple-locked pensions, while everything for the young was cut to shreds \u2013 education, benefits, youth services, sure starts, arts, sports \u2013 everything? The \u201cfuture\u201d for the Tories only stretched as far as cajoling oldies into the polling booths at the next election. Since 2010, spending on children has fallen by 10%, making children the most likely to be poor \u2013 and the old the least: contrary to what Boris Johnson told Andrew Marr last weekend, child poverty is rising sharply on current government plans, to nearly 40% by 2022. Angela Rayner, spelling out again Labour\u2019s priorities for children, reminded us she would be an education minister like no other, her emphasis exactly where it\u2019s most needed, on the long tail of failure that drags down national results, the half not destined for university. Her own back story of single motherhood at 16, saved by a further education college, and Sure Start for her child, is the guarantee that for the first time in years someone who really understands what\u2019s needed will pay more than lip service to toddlers, skills and life chances. All children will gain from Labour\u2019s big uplift in school spending and extra teachers, but the chances are that Rayner would most improve results by focusing on the non-university half. Before anyone says magic-money-tree unaffordable, remember the Resolution Foundation judges Labour\u2019s plans would increase the size of the state to the average for similar north European countries. What a polar opposite Rayner would be to all that Michael Gove did, with his endless favouring of top achievers. He toughened GCSEs so top universities could distinguish better between A* candidates. His more finely graded system has, says the Sutton Trust, widened the gap as fewer disadvantaged children now get the top grade 9, compared to those who used to get A*. Grammar schools have expanded, and his free schools were designed for sharp-elbowed parents and religious schools were allowed to select 100% of their pupils. I have seen even low-paid families struggle to pay for extra tuition to help keep their children up with the more affluent. This week\u2019s Pisa results show a moderate improvement in maths and English scores \u2013 good \u2013 though worth noting these children spent their primary years better funded under Labour, where David Blunkett\u2019s introduction of the literacy and numeracy hour created an uplift in scores. When it comes to GCSE results, the rising number of pupils \u201coff-rolled\u201d before they get to them \u2013 the 24,600 conveniently disappeared \u2013 boost many schools\u2019 results. Unsurprisingly, it has been impossible to recruit enough teachers; training targets have been missed for the last seven years. The relentless orders, tick-boxes and inspections, with an overly rigid curriculum, has turned them into stressed-out automatums. Look at the price children paid for Gove\u2019s Gradgrind regime. Pisa found exceptional joylessness in British children, the UK alone in having almost half our children regularly feeling sad and not able to say, \u201cmy life has a clear meaning and purpose.\u201d Children\u2019s mental health has worsened severely, with one in eight needing help. Look at all that\u2019s been lost of those things that might make children happy: the selling off of playgrounds and sports grounds, with closed or price-hiked leisure centres and virtually no youth services. The children\u2019s commissioner finds: \u201cWe have the least physically active generation of children ever.\u201d Look how the arts are vanishing from many schools. Music entries for GCSE have dropped by over a fifth, and only half of children take any arts subject as drama, dance, art and music. What of enriching lives? Or, in Gradgrind mode, learning the disciplines imposed by performance? Rayner\u2019s free breakfasts will do much more than measurably increase the technical attainment of the poorest. They are a welcome into school as a kindly nurturing place each morning for every child, as is keeping schools open for after-school and holiday play. The Child Poverty Action Group and Thomas Coram Research Unit\u2019s research into child hunger is shocking, as children tell of stabbing hunger pains, and meal-skipping parents pretending they have eaten. Children speak of sitting with friends at lunchtime pretending they don\u2019t want to eat. Only 15% qualify for free school meals, and many more go hungry after the Tories lowered the income threshold families need to fall below in order to qualify for them. Labour\u2019s policy of free meals for all primary school children will reach the many children of gamblers, addicts or parents suffering from mental health issues, who fall below the radar. The greatest loss has been the closure or virtual destruction of Labour\u2019s best achievement, the 3,500 Sure Start children\u2019s centres that Rayner will bring back. The best hope of happiness is helping families resolve problems from birth. It\u2019s no surprise that in all the harshness and mean-spiritedness of this decade\u2019s policies, people feel compassion has been lost. Today, a survey from Action for Happiness finds 60% of people believe Britain has become less caring over the last 10 years. As you prepare to vote, note its findings on the top five predictors for how compassionate people are, irrespective of income, social class or location. These are the factors they found were most associated with compassion: being female, voting remain, living with others, being under 35 \u2013 and voting Labour. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
