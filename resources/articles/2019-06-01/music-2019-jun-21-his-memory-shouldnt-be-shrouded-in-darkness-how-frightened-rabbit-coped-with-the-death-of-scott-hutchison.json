Guitarist Simon Liddell and bassist Billy Kennedy, sitting in a Glasgow cafe, turn to one another for a moment, then shake their heads. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t exist without Scott at all,\u201d says Kennedy. \u201cScott is Frightened Rabbit.\u201d That present tense is telling. Scott Hutchison, the singer and chief songwriter of the Scottish indie-rock band, took his own life last year aged 36, after years with depression. Grant Hutchison, the band\u2019s drummer and Scott\u2019s younger brother, feels that the music now belongs to the listeners who were consoled by the band\u2019s deeply empathic music. Head Rolls Off, perhaps their best-loved song, contains a lyric: \u201cWhen my blood stops / Someone else\u2019s will have not.\u201d The band are living that line: working out how to carry the group\u2019s legacy while moving on with their own lives. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult balance,\u201d Grant says. \u201cAre we keeping the band alive? Are we keeping Scott alive?\u201d The four surviving members have gathered to talk about the new album, Tiny Changes. Named for a line in Head Rolls Off, it sees artists including Biffy Clyro and Chvrches\u2019 Lauren Mayberry cover, in its entirety, their 2008 LP The Midnight Organ Fight. Scott was the driving force behind the covers album, and had heard all the new versions before his death. The band are therefore keen that it should not be seen as a tribute to a life cut short. \u201cI try to keep looking at it as a celebration,\u201d says the guitarist Andy Monaghan. \u201cIt has taken on a different energy, I guess, but I don\u2019t want to dwell on that. It\u2019s a celebration of what the band had become, and the relationships with the artists who are on there.\u201d The Twilight Sad cover Floating in the Forth, in which Scott articulated a desire to end his life alongside his decision not to do so. As the band closest to Frightened Rabbit since the beginning of their careers, the band\u2019s singer, James Graham, says he felt a sense of duty in taking on the track. \u201cWho else could have touched that? It scares me that we did that song. But I felt that we, as his friends, could step up and do it.\u201d The song\u2019s final line, which in the original is sung with a sort of desperate euphoria, is: \u201cI think I\u2019ll save suicide for another year.\u201d In Graham\u2019s version, that line becomes a refrain, emphasising the optimism and hope of his friend\u2019s choice to live. \u201cThen,\u201d he says, \u201cwhat happened happened.\u201d After making two troubling posts on Twitter, Scott left his hotel just west of Edinburgh late at night. His body was found in the same river he had sung about. \u201cI still love the song,\u201d says Grant of Floating in the Forth, \u201cbut I\u2019ll probably never listen to it again.\u201d He recalls the first time his brother let him hear it. \u201cThat was like a gut punch. But it was such a beautiful song. I remember thinking: \u2018Should this go on the album? Is that OK?\u2019 And I remember saying: \u2018What is Mum going to think?\u2019 But that happened with every album, particularly the last one.\u201d This was 2016\u2019s Painting of a Panic Attack. \u201cScott having come a lot closer to taking his own life over the years, that was far more worrying than when I first heard Midnight Organ Fight because it was a lot more real.\u201d Scott had an alcohol dependency, according to Grant, something that was related to his depression. He would drink to forget how he felt. That last album contained a song titled I Wish I Was Sober. \u201cBy the time the last record was written,\u201d says Grant, \u201cI knew in my head that this was how it would end. I said to my girlfriend at the time that this is going to happen.\u201d You had braced yourself for his death? \u201cYeah, over a period of maybe a year and a half. There were lots of signs. In terms of the family and how we all coped, I think I was more prepared. I hadn\u2019t made my peace with it because it\u2019s still an incredibly difficult and shocking thing to happen. But I kind of knew that was how he would say goodbye. I knew it wouldn\u2019t be a case of us growing old and one of us going to the other\u2019s funeral when we were 70, 80 years old.\u201d Grant, who has received counselling in the wake of Scott\u2019s death, says that grief hasn\u2019t had a straight trajectory. \u201cThe normal things you\u2019ll read about grief, they didn\u2019t apply to me. What I read a lot were the steps that you go through, but they weren\u2019t linear like that for me. It was like one day, it\u2019s this and the next day, it jumps to this.\u201d Even now? \u201cIt still jumps all the time. Obviously, with suicide, there\u2019s a lot of guilt that comes with it, which is the hardest one to deal with.\u201d Grant says that he was wary of saying to his brother: \u201cDon\u2019t do this\u201d, worried that any direct conversation might only add to the burden of Scott\u2019s pain and stress. (The Samaritans\u2019 suicide prevention advice says that people should not be afraid to tackle the subject of suicide with someone contemplating it, and that anything that helps them to open up and seek help is good.) Grant says: \u201cHis depression and anxiety were bad enough without me going: \u2018I need you to stay.\u2019 It\u2019s a horrible thing to say, but some people just don\u2019t want to be here. I did so many things over the years that probably did stop it happening [for a while].\u201d These included encouraging his brother to have therapy, and to consider cancelling shows and tours to ease the pressure. Although Grant was the younger brother, he acted like the elder: a steadying and responsible presence. Even when they were children, Scott was so anxious about sleeping alone at night that Grant\u2019s bed was moved into his room. Frightened Rabbit was Scott\u2019s nickname as a child, given to him by their mother. Grant is OK at compartmentalising his life, he says, but finds it hard to separate Scott the singer from the family member. An attempt to do so was partly behind his decision a few years ago to take a short break from Frightened Rabbit, reasoning: \u201cOK, if I can\u2019t be in a band with you then I still want you as a brother.\u201d There was distance between them for a time, but Grant says the closeness did return. In the month before Scott\u2019s death, they did a short tour of small venues as part of their Mastersystem side project, and travelled by van. \u201cIt was a load of fun and no pressure. It felt like going back to where we\u2019d started.\u201d One reason Frightened Rabbit are so important to so many people is because of the overwhelming mutual empathy in the room when they played live. The joy and force of the music, juxtaposed with the sadness and candour of the lyrics, created a sense of a crowd and band with their arms around one another. For the Hutchisons, too, gigs seemed to be the place where those distinctions between brother and bandmate collapsed. \u201cEven when things were not good between us, we always connected,\u201d Grant recalls. \u201cThe energy. The feeling. The majority of the time, when our relationship was strong, those nights were indescribable.\u201d Grant wants to be able to enjoy listening to the music of Frightened Rabbit again. \u201cI\u2019ve got two nieces and a nephew through my older brother, and I hope to one day have kids. And I want Scott to be a big part of their lives.\u201d He would like to be able to play the songs to those children and say: \u201cThis was your uncle. This is what he sounded like. This is what he did with his life.\u201d The songs they hear may include material which has not, so far, been released. Scott, working with Monaghan, had recorded demos for the next Frightened Rabbit album, and the vocals are good enough to use. When the band are ready, they will finish the songs and put them out. They know it will be hard to be in the studio without Scott there, without his creative energy and his laughter. When a famous musician dies, there is often a well-intentioned tendency to romanticise them as a tragic figure. Ought it be resisted? Liddell nods: \u201cI don\u2019t think Scott\u2019s legacy or memory should be shrouded in darkness.\u201d Since Scott\u2019s death, the Twilight Sad have been performing the Frightened Rabbit song Keep Yourself Warm in concert, intended as a moment of shared catharsis for band and audience. For Graham, what made his friend special as a songwriter was his ability to write about heartbreak in a way that wasn\u2019t simply confessional, but allowed listeners to feel that their own darkness was being expressed. \u201cScott\u2019s voice will always be with us. His words will always be with us,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop shouting from the rooftops or screaming from small stages about how amazing he was. I think it\u2019s important that we remember him through the beautiful things that he put into the world.\u201d Tiny Changes will be released on 12 July on Atlantic Records.
