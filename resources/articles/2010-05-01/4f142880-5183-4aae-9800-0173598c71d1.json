On Saturday afternoon they were impressively efficient in disposing of South Africa, who were unable to get the start they wanted and who uncharacteristically missed two chances, the most crucial the outside edge offered by Kevin Pietersen at the end of the third over that whistled between keeper and first slip. The brutality of his subsequent assault all but settled the match. So England, against expectation beyond their own camp, top their group and are strong contenders to reach the semi-finals. However, wins for New Zealand (who survive on the back of their last-ball win over Pakistan) and South Africa, over Pakistan, would see three teams on four points and a skirmish over net run-rate. Pakistan could still qualify, if they overwhelm South Africa and the Kiwis lose significantly. There is still much to play for over the next two days. Should England top their group and go on to reach the final in Bridgetown on 16 May, current form suggests it would be against Australia. Current form in Twenty20 cricket, however, is the most fickle of concepts. The impending arrival of Pietersen's first child and the batsman's temporary return to England has at least given Paul Collingwood and Andy Flower an opportunity to assess whether the performances and results have in some way masked the fact that they might not have found their strongest combination. There is, for example, a slightly disconcerting feel to seeing Luke Wright striding jauntily out to the middle at No6 in any circumstance other than one in which he can heave away agriculturally. Will Stuart Broad remain the best option as third seamer on a pitch that will have a pace between that of Providence and the rapid Kensington Oval surface? Has he the artfulness to adjust or would the experience of Jimmy Anderson be better, especially as confidence in Broad's batting has deteriorated to the point where he goes in at 10? And what of the opening partnership which has helped to produce the two highest powerplay six\u2011over totals of the tournament \u2013 65 for one against South Africa and 60 for one against West Indies \u2013 but which has flaws to be exploited? This opening pair was conceived through watching Craig Kieswetter's performances for Somerset and Michael Lumb's for Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League. Kieswetter's powerful success against England in Abu Dhabi (for the England Lions) and for them in Bangladesh saw him fast\u2011tracked. Lumb is more of a hunch, as he has been around for a while. Both are impressively robust strikers of the ball and hitters of sixes \u2013 increasingly, it seems, the game's raison d'\u00eatre. This, though, is not enough for a format that evolves rapidly, according to circumstance. Expecting an ordeal by pace on Saturday, Lumb instead was confronted by the off-spin of Johan Botha and was totally flummoxed and dismissed in the first over. Kieswetter stagnated against similar bowling. So far it is Lumb, helped by fielding restrictions, who has powered the way, scoring the fastest of the England batsmen with a strike rate of 154.34 but a top score of only 28. Spin may be his achilles heel. Kieswetter has hit six sixes and seven fours so far, yet scores barely above a run a ball. That discrepancy needs addressing as there is no time for entrenchment \u2013 unless his strike rate is exclusively a reflection of turning over the strike to an aggressive partner. It is not. He fails to score from too many balls. There is an option to consider, built on Pietersen's absence from the next match. Ravi Bopara will come in and a strong performance from him could, on Pietersen's return, give England an option at the top of the order (he is a more accomplished player of spin than either of the current openers) or at No6 instead of Wright, whose bowling no longer appears useful. Bopara is a busy player, who might well take account of the fact that no player of consequence in the albeit brief history of international cricket faces a lower percentage of dot balls than does the man he is replacing. The past couple of weeks have been a little chastening for Anderson, England's senior pace bowler, who at Kensington Oval a year ago was pronounced the leader of the pack. The continuing excellence of Ryan Sidebottom and the no\u2011frills competitiveness of Tim Bresnan mean that he must compete for Broad's place. Simply that the side is winning is no reason not to seek to improve. England would do well to be wary of the Kiwis, who have yet to play to their potential. Brendon McCullum is the godfather of Twenty20 batting but he has scarcely got out of the blocks and the same could be said of the dangerous Jesse Ryder and Ross Taylor. New Zealand have always been a cut above on sluggish pitches, akin to home, and for this match they might well consider abandoning the pace attack that they employed to scrape home against Pakistan, and to recall both Jacob Oram and Tim Southee in place of Kyle Mills and Ian Butler.
