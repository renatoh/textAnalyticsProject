McKay, a Fifa-licensed agent registered with the Scottish Football Association, told the Sunday People that he had handed the money to the once-capped France international as a loan. \"Pascal had just joined Spurs and was a bit short at the time, so I gave him some money,\" he said. \"He rang me up and asked if I could lend him \u00a318,000, so I said, 'No problem, just come up and get it'.\" Chimbonda was detained for questioning by detectives of the City of London police last week as part of a year-long investigation into suspected corruption in football. He has been bailed until October along with a 61-year-old man from Manchester who was arrested in May. But McKay says the payment was legitimate. Throughout recent investigations into \"bungs\" he has insisted he has records for all his financial activities. \"I didn't want to give him cash, so it was a cheque and he signed a bit of paper for it,\" he said. \"If it was underhand, why would I give him a cheque from my account?\" The loan is unconnected to the investigations led by the former Metropolitan Police commissioner, Lord Stevens, because Chimbonda's transfer to Spurs, on deadline day in August last year, came outside the terms of reference of the inquiry by Stevens' Quest team. That looked at 362 Premier League transfers over the 25-month period from January 1 2004, 17 of which Stevens refused to \"sign off\" as satisfactory. In its final report delivered in June, Quest said it was \"awaiting clarification\" from McKay of his conduct in several of the outstanding transfers. Quest also paid particular attention to the renegotiation of Chimbonda's contract while he was still at Wigan Athletic. He had moved there from the French club Bastia in summer 2005, with McKay acting as his agent. Throughout the investigations by Quest and the City of London police McKay has denied any wrongdoing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
