On this evidence, if the Southampton board does brazen out the hostile response from the fans and pins its faith in St Glenn's second coming, then Hoddle will be left with quite a task. Southampton must currently rank as one of the three worst sides in the Premiership. One of the few redeeming features of their listless performance here was that they scraped an undeserving draw. At 33 points they are the most overvalued stock in the Premiership. Blackburn, only five points above the bottom three, rued a missed opportunity. Blackburn's home form now amounts to three points in six matches and the future visits of two other relegation candidates, Leicester and Portsmouth, are taking on increasing significance. That Southampton's chairman Rupert Lowe does not seem overly anxious to make an appointment is strange. Maybe when Hoddle was asked whether he wanted to come back, he thought Lowe was talking about the next life. Or perhaps he has been studying astrological forecasts which predict he will be more loved and appreciated in May. Southampton's goalscorer, Kevin Phillips, was one of their few bright spots - his run of five goals in six game smacks of feats of old - but he knows that Steve Wigley's spell as caretaker manager is dragging on. Footballers like certainty and generally regard caretaker managers like toddlers view childminders. They may toe the line but they know it is not the real thing. \"Steve has said he doesn't want the job full-time, so the sooner that somebody takes over the better,\" Phillips said. \"It has not unsettled or affected me but I'm sure everybody would like to see the new man in as soon as possible.\" It took Phillips only five minutes to take advantage of the sort of crass Blackburn defending that has driven Graeme Souness to despair. Jason Dodd pumped in a right-wing cross, James Beattie (for long periods so immobile he made the likes of Leeds's Mark Viduka look frisky) won the header and Blackburn's defence froze, in vague hope of offside, while Phillips lashed the ball past Brad Freidel. Souness resorted to black humour. \"It was a very bad goal. You wonder where the defenders went. Pump it forward to big man, big man heads it down to small man and small man scores in oceans of space.\" Souness is taking grim refuge in the fact that Blackburn are the only Premiership side not to have been awarded a penalty this season. It is the sort of conspiracy theory that managers cherish, but the evidence that Souness assembled - a nondescript first-half tackle by Graeme Le Saux after Tugay Kerimoglu had put Brett Emerton clear - hardly encouraged you to rail at the injustice. Two nervy defences were fortunate not to concede more goals before half-time. But it was Souness's tactical switch at half-time that made Rovers dominant, as he brought on two experienced strikers, Matt Jansen and Dwight Yorke, and pushed Michael Gray forward, playing just three at the back. Jansen, whose career stalled after a motorcycle accident left him with a serious head injury, was full of zest, Gray flared briefly and Andy Cole equalised seven minutes into the half, when Dodd's challenge inadvertently sent the ball into his path. Cole should have put Blackburn ahead a minute later but he drove straight at the impressive Finn, Antti Niemi.
