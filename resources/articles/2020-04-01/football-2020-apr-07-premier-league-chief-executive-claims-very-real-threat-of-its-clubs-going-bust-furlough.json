In a striking letter to the parliamentary select committee for digital, culture, media and sport, Masters describes losses at an \u201cunprecedented level\u201d \u2013 potentially more than \u00a31bn \u2013 across top-division English football, and an uncertain future for the game as a whole. \u201cNot only is our industry facing losses now,\u201d he writes, \u201cwe must base our plans on full recovery being some distance away.\u201d In a response to questions posed by the chair of the DCMS committee, the Tory MP Julian Knight, Masters writes: \u201cThe furlough scheme announced by Government is meant for the whole economy, including many enterprises which might be regarded as providing entertainment or otherwise dependent on elite talent. We do agree with you that restraint needs to be shown by all and we and our Clubs are doing just that. Individual Clubs will need to make these decisions based on their own forecasts as each Club will have its own unique position.\u201d Negotiations are continuing between Premier League clubs and their players over the possibility of deferring or cutting players\u2019 wages. But four clubs \u2013 Newcastle, Tottenham, Bournemouth and Norwich \u2013 have applied to use the government\u2019s furlough scheme for employees, which has met with widespread public disapproval. On Monday, Liverpool reversed a decision to furlough staff and apologised after fierce criticism. In his letter Masters paints a broader and bleaker picture of the state of football. Last week, the Premier League advanced \u00a3125m of funding to the EFL to help clubs lower down the pyramid stay afloat. Similar problems could soon await top-flight clubs too, Masters says. \u201cLike much of the productive economy in the UK, we are losing revenue at an unprecedented level,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe face a \u00a31 billion loss, at least, if we fail to complete Season 2019/20 and further losses going forward if the seriousness of the pandemic deepens and extends into the future \u2026 Ultimately, the very heavy losses that we face will have to be dealt with or else Clubs and other enterprises who depend on football for income will go out of business. We do not say this lightly, or to justify Clubs\u2019 decisions; it is a very real threat.\u201d Masters said the league, its clubs and players generated more than \u00a33bn a year for the exchequer, including more than \u00a31bn from players\u2019 salaries. He argued that it was \u201ccrucial therefore that we as an industry can ensure our future financial viability\u201d. Masters\u2019 warning was echoed on Tuesday by the chairman of the Football Association, Greg Clarke. Speaking to the FA council, Clarke \u2013 who has agreed a 25% cut to his salary \u2013 said football stakeholders must \u201cshare the pain\u201d if an existential threat to the game is to be avoided. \u201cFootball faces economic challenges beyond the wildest imagination of those who run it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pandemic will be followed by its economic consequences and all business sectors will suffer. \u201cWe face the danger of losing clubs and leagues as finances collapse. Many communities could lose the clubs at their heart with little chance of resurrection. In the face of this unprecedented adversity, all the stakeholders within the game from players, fans, clubs, owners and administrators need to step up and share the pain to keep the game alive.\u201d Clarke also said Premier League clubs were \u201cnot immune from the impact\u201d and added: \u201cWe must have a plan to ensure that English football is not decimated should this season be lost and next season blighted.\u201d Knight issued a combative response to Masters\u2019 letter. \u201cIt is frankly laughable to think that clubs are showing restraint on use of government money to pay non-playing staff and flies in the face of public opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cLiverpool has listened to fans, done the right thing and changed its mind. It is time for the Premier League to stop defending the indefensible. They should be working out a way to carry on paying the wages of club staff without resorting to taking money from the government scheme.\u201d Knight is one of a number of Conservative politicians to have criticised football clubs and players in recent days. Remarks made by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, were widely held to have complicated negotiations over wage cuts, and on Monday the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, called on players and clubs to \u201csupport the National Effort\u201d. These comments are increasingly proving counterproductive with clubs and players, however. One senior Premier League executive, speaking to the Guardian, criticised Knight\u2019s latest remarks and questioned why football has been singled out rather than other industries who have not faced as much criticism for furloughing staff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
