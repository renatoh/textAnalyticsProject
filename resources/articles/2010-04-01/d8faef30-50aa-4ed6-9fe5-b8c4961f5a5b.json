The heartwarming tale of a northern retiree, perhaps, who finds herself accused of prejudice after discussing eastern Europeans with the prime minister? We suggest you reserve your primetime Sunday night slot now. \u2724 But in the meantime, let us forget all that unsavoury business in Rochdale, and toast the good women of Birmingham City Council, 4,500 of whom have won the right to be paid the same as their male colleagues. Which isn't an awful lot to ask, is it? The women, who were all employed in traditionally female-dominated roles, had been excluded from bonuses \u2013 worth up to 160% of their basic pay \u2013 which had been paid to their male colleagues. Amid all the celebrations, it's worth remembering that it is now 40 years since the Equal Pay Act was introduced, and yet the full-time pay gap between men and women stands at 17.1% and widening; this is the equivalent of men being paid all year round and women working for free from the end of October. \u2724 But heaven knows what Alison Cooper would make of it. Poised to take over the reins at Imperial Tobacco, and in line to become only the second British woman to head a FTSE 100 company, Cooper has this week taken issue with positive discrimination in boardrooms, and claims never to have encountered any kind of glass ceiling. Good for you, Cooper. Just don't go throwing any stones now, will you? \u2724 You may be aware that while there are currently more women in space than ever, the recent women and astronomy conference She is an Astronomer highlighted the fact that just a quarter of professional astronomers are female. Disappointing. Anyone instructing their daughter to \"reach for the stars\" should perhaps clarify that they do not mean: (i) following the teachings of Russell Grant and co; (ii) groping premiership football players at Whiskey Mist. There are better ways to make one's way in the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
