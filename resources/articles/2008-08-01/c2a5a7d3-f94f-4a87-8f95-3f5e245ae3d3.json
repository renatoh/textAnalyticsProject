Pavey finished fourth in Osaka last summer after being overtaken in the final sprint for the line, a result which left her frustrated but even more motivated for Olympic success. The 34-year-old, a former room-mate and close friend of Dame Kelly Holmes, heads into Beijing next week eager to claim a place on the Olympic podium. \"Everything we do is about trying to achieve a medal at the Olympics,\" said Pavey, who is competing at her third Games. \"Although last year was the first year I ran the 10,000m, I was frustrated to just miss out on a medal at the world championships. \"But that experience gave me the motivation to keep training hard and go that one step better in Beijing.\" Pavey is now a veteran of major championships. Her Olympic debut was in Sydney in 2000, when she first shared a room with Holmes. On that occasion she was \"thrilled\" just to make the final of the 5,000m as she struggled to come to terms with the pressure of competing at the Games. In Athens four years later she finished fifth in the 5,000m, an effort which was overshadowed by Holmes's second gold medal, achieved less than half an hour earlier. But Pavey's role in that triumph was not insignificant. Holmes believes their friendship - \"we seemed to laugh all the time,\" she wrote in her autobiography - played an important role in keeping her relaxed as she completed that historic gold medal double. Pavey is determined to earn her own moment that will bring her widespread recognition. She has put her name down for the 5,000m but more as a back-up plan than anything else. That Osaka experience helped crystallise her thinking and her sole focus now is to win a 10,000m medal. Ethiopia have four athletes entered in the event, including the world championships gold medallist Tirunesh Dibaba. Pavey may well have to change her asthma medication in order to deal with the oppressive environment, but the Devon-born athlete is used to competing in energy-sapping conditions. \"I am really excited about it and I think the experience of Osaka will stand me in good stead. The 10,000m is what I have focused all my training on,\" she said. \"The race at the world championships came down to who could handle the heat best. It was over 37 degrees and there was really high humidity. It became more of a slog, who could last out? That was an unusual situation for a championship but I think Beijing will be the same. \"The Ethiopians have been the ones to watch for a number of years. They have set the world records in recent times, they have fast finishes and are very difficult to beat. But you need to think about your strategies rather than just the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition. How can you prepare to deal with the conditions and use that to your advantage? \"You have got to be at your absolute best on the day at the Olympics. I have these new running shoes which weigh less than 100 grams so that might help me run a bit faster. It is exciting.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
