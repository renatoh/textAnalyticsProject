Vocally, both were on top form, Netrebko's luscious soprano matching Hvorostovsky's iron-clad baritone bar for bar. Only her lack of trills in the Jewel Song from Faust showed up a gap in her technique. Hvorostovsky commanded the concert platform with the same easy glamour he brings to the stage. No gesture, physical or vocal, was less than flawlessly realised. His delivery of Yeletsky's aria from Tchaikovsky's Queen of Spades was controlled with a fineness that easily encompassed emotional sincerity, while closing with the final scene from Eugene Onegin gave the pair the opportunity to interact with convincing commitment. Earlier, Netrebko flaunted glittering high notes in Arditi's coloratura showpiece Il Bacio, and deployed a misty-eyed top register in a perfectly articulated Song to the Moon from Rusalka. Hvorostovsky shone in a beefy account of Valentin's aria from Faust, and then snarled and pleaded his way through Rigoletto's great Cortigiani solo. At encore Netrebko nearly brought the house down with a steamy version of Leh\u00e1r's Meine Lippen Sie K\u00fcssen So Heiss \u2013 the brazen sexuality of an upstage dance was only partially hidden by the second violins. Hvorostovsky's Dark Eyes seemed inhibited by comparison, but scarcely less sexily sung. Lawrence Foster is a cut above the level of conductor usually hired for this sort of event, and he and the Philharmonia made a strong showing in the orchestral items."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
