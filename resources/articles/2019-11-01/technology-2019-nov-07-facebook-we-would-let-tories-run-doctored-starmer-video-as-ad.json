But the company has announced a policy aimed at cracking down on pages that conceal their ownership in order to mislead users. The executive Rebecca Stimson said the public debate that followed the airing of footage of the senior Labour MP in an ITV interview justified the company\u2019s policy of allowing political misinformation on the site. \u201cYou can see, in the UK, what that has meant is that what the Conservatives put in that ad has been the subject of ferocious political debate and discussion, as a result of our policies,\u201d said Stimson, the company\u2019s head of UK public policy. In the controversial video, posted to Twitter on Tuesday, footage of an interview between Starmer and Piers Morgan was edited in a way that suggested the shadow Brexit secretary was lost for words when asked about the party\u2019s Brexit policy. The Conservative party maintains that the video was edited not to try to misinform people, but to shorten the clip for social sharing. Morgan himself accused the Conservatives, of having \u201cdoctored\u201d the video; a charge denied by the party chairman, James Cleverly. Facebook\u2019s approach to political advertising suggests the company is unlikely to heed calls from civil society groups to pause political adverts in the run-up to the election. Stimson said: \u201cPolitical advertising on Facebook and Instagram is now more transparent than other forms of election campaigning, whether that\u2019s billboards, newspaper ads, direct mail, leaflets or targeted emails. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s important that candidates and politicians can communicate with their constituents and would-be constituents. Online political ads are also important for both new challengers and campaigning groups to get their message out. Our approach is therefore to make political messages on our platforms as transparent as possible, not to remove them altogether.\u201d On misinformation, Stimson argued: \u201cIn general, we believe political speech should be heard and we don\u2019t feel it is right for private companies like us to fact-check or judge the veracity of what politicians and political parties say. In our country it\u2019s always been up to the media and the voters to scrutinise what politicians say and make their own minds up.\u201d Facebook said a policy aimed at cracking down on pages that conceal their ownership in order to mislead users would bring greater transparency. Its head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said: \u201cIf we find that a page is doing this, we require it to show more information on the page itself about who is behind it, including the organisation\u2019s legal name, and the city it\u2019s set up in.\u201d The rules appear to finally close a loophole uncovered by the Guardian earlier this year that allowed a lobbying firm owned by the political strategist Lynton Crosby to freely run a widespread propaganda campaign on the social network. CTF Partners, Crosby\u2019s firm, which has worked for Conservative campaigns, owned and ran Facebook pages that purported to be independent news sources on topics ranging from Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to bike lanes in London. The company then used them to push content created by CTF employees that aimed to promote a particular viewpoint. At times, CTF would build pages that appeared to take opposing sides of the same campaign, in order to more effectively manipulate public sentiment. Facebook had initially argued that, since the CTF employees were not using fake accounts, the operation did not meet the company\u2019s definition of coordinated inauthentic behaviour, even if users had no way of discovering the lobbying firm\u2019s involvement. In a similar campaign, operated by Daily Wire, the rightwing US news site ran 14 large Facebook pages anonymously, according to a report by Popular Information. The pages, which disclosed no link to the publisher, funnelled millions of engagements back to Daily Wire content. Under Facebook\u2019s new policy, however, both Daily Wire and CTF Partners could be required to have their legal names displayed in their pages\u2019 information boxes, possibly preventing the worst abuses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
