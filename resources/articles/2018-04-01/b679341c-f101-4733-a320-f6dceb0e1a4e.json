Roth said Australia should increase its refugee intake in response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria. On Saturday, the US, France and the UK launched military strikes on Syria after reports of chemical weapons attacks on civilians. \u201cThe irony here is that it\u2019s much easier to bomb Syria in response to [president Bashar al-] Assad\u2019s atrocities than it is to [accept] refugees who are fleeing this. We should do the hard thing,\u201d Roth said. \u201cEvery wealthy government that has means should be bringing in far more refugees.\u201d Roth\u2019s call was backed by Labor\u2019s veteran\u2019s affairs spokeswoman, Amanda Rishworth, who said the country \u201ccan be more generous and ... accept more refugees\u201d. But the comments from American-based Roth drew scorn from Grahame Morris, the former chief of staff to then-prime minister John Howard, in what proved the minor flashpoint of an otherwise sedate discussion. \u201cI\u2019m getting a bit sick of people like Ken from overseas giving us curry,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting lectures from people from overseas saying: \u2018Hey, you\u2019ve got to do more.\u2019 Are people who queue and do the right thing somehow less worthy than people who come in through the back door?\u201d Roth responded: \u201cPeople who are facing death and persecution don\u2019t have the option to queue. They\u2019ve got to get out.\u201d Songwriter Missy Higgins said Australia\u2019s treatment of refugees fleeing places like Syria was \u201cjust really appalling\u201d. When discussion turned to a question on religious freedom, Roth argued that people cited religious freedom to justify acts of bigotry and discrimination. He said the government, which is conducting a religious freedom review after the vote to legalise gay marriage, needed to draw the line to prevent religion being used to justify mistreatment. \u201cReligious freedom is about personal beliefs,\u201d Roth said. \u201cNo one can tell you about what god to pray to, or how you are going to pray, or who you are going to get together with when you pray. Those are all critical elements of freedom of religion. \u201cOn the other hand, some people cite freedom of religion to justify mistreating others and that\u2019s where you have to draw the line. For example, when people say: \u2018I\u2019m not going to bake a cake in my bakery for a gay couple.\u2019 That\u2019s bigotry, that\u2019s discrimination. That\u2019s not freedom of religion, and it\u2019s important to make that clear. \u201cHow we treat other people is a matter for discrimination laws ... it\u2019s not a matter for our religious freedom, our personal beliefs.\u201d The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, raised concern that any legislation designed to protect religious freedom could \u201ccreate a problem that didn\u2019t previously exist\u201d. \u201cIn trying to fix a problem you [can] codify what you don\u2019t want to be acceptable into being accepted.\u201d Morris said it was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d that churches should be exempt from performing gay weddings, but that the review needed to look at other cases. \u201cWhat about a country hall, where the council is a bit uncomfortable?\u201d Morris said. In a wide-ranging discussion, which also touched on Facebook and the role of celebrities in public debate, Morris revealed that senior ministers \u201cfrom the prime minister on down\u201d have been alarmed by attempted cyberespionage attacks on Australian agencies. \u201cThey are seeing stuff that\u2019s really got \u2019em spooked,\u201d Morris said. \u201cThere have been a number of would-be attacks on various government departments, various government agencies from the outside and it\u2019s really got them worried.\u201d Fifield said electronic means provided a new avenue for espionage. \u201cWe need to be vigilant, not just around our traditional adversaries but also those who have technology and who aren\u2019t necessarily part of a state organisation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
