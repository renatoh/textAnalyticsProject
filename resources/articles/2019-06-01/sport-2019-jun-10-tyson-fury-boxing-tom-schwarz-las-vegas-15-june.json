Fury faces the German Tom Schwarz at the MGM Grand and the fight against the undefeated 24-year-old is being treated by the promoter, Bob Arum, as a chance to introduce Fury to the broader American public. He is the strong favourite but cannot risk the same experience as his rival Anthony Joshua, whose shock defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr sent shockwaves through boxing. \u201cAs we saw last week, you can\u2019t overlook anybody,\u201d Fury said. \u201cThis is heavyweight boxing and Tom Schwarz knows if he beats Tyson Fury, then he\u2019s set for life. He becomes a multimillionaire, he gets to headline big shows and all his dreams come true. \u201cBut you\u2019re talking to a king. I\u2019ll figure him out within the first five seconds of the fight. Because that\u2019s what I do. Within five seconds I\u2019ll know exactly what to do with him. \u201cWhen you get paid as much as I am, motivation is easy. Very easy,\u201d Fury said, slipping into the one-liners that come easily to him but are only one facet of the fighter\u2019s complex persona. \u201cThis is a massive attraction of a fight, the UK, Europe, America. This is going to be epic. This is going to be a boxing behemoth.\u201d Arum, whose half century of experience has seen him work with the greats of the sport from Ali to Hagler and Pacquiao, has bet on Fury as the man to bring a big audience to new American streaming player, ESPN+. In the UK the fight will be shown on BT Sport Box Office. \u201cHe has the ability to capture the imagination not only of boxing fans but of sports fans and the public at large,\u201d Arum said. \u201cTyson Fury is the people\u2019s fighter.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an easy job for Bob,\u201d Fury chipped in. \u201cHe has promoted the best fighters in the world and now he gets to promote the most talkable character, the lovable rogue, the handsome British guy.\u201d With a deal for three fights with the WBC champion Deontay Wilder apparently confirmed by Arum, the prospect of future earnings lost is just one more layer of pressure added to Saturday\u2019s fight. Fury is revelling in his transformation from pantomime villain to people\u2019s pugilist following his December draw with Wilder. \u201cHaving people want you to succeed is much better than having people want to knock you out,\u201d he said. Tyson Fury takes on Tom Schwarz, live on BT Sport Box Office, Saturday 15 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
