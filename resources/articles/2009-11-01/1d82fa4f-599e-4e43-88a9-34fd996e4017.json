One of Wales's wasted resources. LEIGH HALFPENNY WING \u2013 5 Kicked a long-range penalty Wales were fortunate to be awarded before injuring himself trying to stop the second row, James Horwill. JAMIE ROBERTS CENTRE \u2013 4 Has come down from his high with the Lions in South Africa. A knock-on near the line and failure to finish off a break summed up his month. JONATHAN DAVIES CENTRE \u2013 6 Showed some neat and inventive touches in midfield before being moved to the wing. One of the few redeeming features for Wales this month. SHANE WILLIAMS WING \u2013 N/A Received the ball for the first time, kicked and injured his right leg chasing after it. A parable of the times. STEPHEN JONES FLY-HALF \u2013 6 Never stopped prompting and probing, but no match for the Giteau-Cooper combination in the Australian midfield. DWAYNE PEEL SCRUM-HALF \u2013 5 One second-half dart confounded the defence, but otherwise showed little threat, merely frustration at what was unfolding in front of him. GETHIN JENKINS PROP, capt \u2013 5 An early tackle on Peter Hynes saved a probable try but the captain was overwhelmed in the tight and unable to stem the flow in the loose. MATTHEW REES HOOKER \u2013 5 Wales' third injury in the first half. Damaged his ribs after taking the ball into contact in what was Wales' first meaningful attack. PAUL JAMES PROP \u2013 4 Conceded a penalty at the first scrum and his evening did not get any better. Ruthlessly exposed out of position for the first time this month. ALUN WYN JONES LOCK \u2013 5 Another player who has lost touch with the form that made him a Lion, and Wales' captain earlier this year. LUKE CHARTERIS LOCK \u2013 4 Lost the ball too often and too easily in the loose. Taken off 10 minutes into the second half and left with a lot to think about. DAN LYDIATE FLANKER \u2013 5 Called in for his first start the day before the game after an injury to Ryan Jones, and rarely found himself in the front foot. MARTYN WILLIAMS FLANKER \u2013 6 Struggled against David Pocock in the first half and George Smith in the second. Forced some turnovers but in the main had to try sliding up an avalanche. ANDY POWELL No8 \u2013 5 One of the players of Wales' autumn series last year, he has become predictable and one-dimensional. Energy and effort generating very little.
