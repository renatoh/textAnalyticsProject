So for the want of a decent ringbinder, the government was forced to bring forward plans to reintroduce grammar schools, a policy the education secretary, Justine Greening, is far less keen on than Theresa May. Still, at least the row about selection and parental choice has taken everyone\u2019s eyes off another embarrassment for the Department for Education. Last year\u2019s SATs are now acknowledged to have been so hard that even primary schools that performed above average have been given a negative progress-related target for next year\u2019s tests. In layman\u2019s terms, this means the majority of schools will have to do less well than last year to prove they are doing better. Tuesday It\u2019s an ill wind ... Keith Vaz announced he would stand down as chair of the home affairs select committee just as many of his colleagues were going through the division lobby to vote on the government\u2019s finance bill. One Labour MP just happened to be standing behind a colleague who is on the committee. Seeing news of Vaz\u2019s resignation on the colleague\u2019s mobile, without blinking an eye, she immediately turned to another Labour MP and said: \u201cI trust you will be supporting my candidacy for chair of the home affairs committee.\u201d The king is dead, long live the queen. She hopes. Still, Vaz does have a few friends left in the Labour party. Ken Livingstone went on Sky News to say a politician shouldn\u2019t be judged on one or two mistakes, such as apparently offering to pay for cocaine and appearing enthusiastic about breaking in an inexperienced east European sex worker. Ken then went on to mention Hitler. Wednesday Relationships don\u2019t get much more meta than this. Having very openly got together at the Met Ball in the summer, actor Tom Hiddleston and singer Taylor Swift then went on to conduct their romance almost entirely in public, with photographers on call to detail every hook-up of l\u2019affaire Hiddleswift. Swift has now very publicly broken up with the Hid on the grounds that their relationship had become too public and the Hid has been very publicly photographed mooching around looking broken-hearted. To make matters worse for the Hid, it now looks as if he won\u2019t land the job of playing the next James Bond that he or his people had been angling for after his success in The Night Manager. Daniel Craig has reportedly been offered $150m to continue as 007 for another couple of films. Thursday At last something Labour can win. For years now, the title of Westminster dog of the year has been a safe Tory seat, but Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds\u2019 two labradoodles, Clinton and Kennedy, managed to see off a strong field to be crowned 2016 champions. \u201cI speak for everyone in the Labour party when I say it\u2019s about time we won something, so we might as well accept this,\u201d Reynolds said. Mind you, Clinton and Kennedy did have an advantage as the competition seemed to be rigged in favour of the bigger dogs: the assault course jumps were twice the size of Clem, the diminutive shih tzu owned by Labour MP Anna Turley. Despite there being two Tories on the judging panel \u2013 Andrea Jenkyns and Hugo Swire, the owners of last year\u2019s winners \u2013 the result wasn\u2019t well received by some Tories, who felt Reynolds\u2019 pooches should have been marked down for not being sound enough on Brexit. Friday Today is the day Britain starts a huge round of trade deals that will be wrapped up within one to two years. At least that\u2019s what the Brexit minister, David Davis, promised in a piece for the Conservative Home blog in July: \u201cI would expect the new prime minister on September 9th to immediately trigger a large round of global trade deals with all our most favoured trade partners. I would expect the negotiation phase of most of them to be concluded within 12 to 14 months.\u201d Except, as the Australians, the US and the Japanese have pointed out in the past week, that isn\u2019t going to happen. Partly because they have said they will prioritise concluding trade deals with the EU, but mainly because it will be impossible to conduct meaningful trade negotiations with other countries until the precise nature of our own exit from the EU has been finalised. So it will be at least two and a half years before we can even start negotiating. All of which is great news for the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, as it means he can do what he likes doing best \u2013 flying round the world doing not very much. With or without his friend Adam Werritty. Digested week, digested: Brexit means never having to give a running commentary on Brexit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
