Choice chief executive Alan Kirkland told a copyright panel hosted by the communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, he had serious concerns about the effectiveness of blocking websites that may have material that infringes copyright. \u201cThe fundamental test if we are going to do something is we need to be confident it will work,\u201d he said at the Online Copyright Infringement Forum in Sydney on Tuesday night. \u201cIf you look at site blocking it is like whacking moles. People who run websites move much faster than courts.\u201d The federal government has released a discussion paper outlining two key proposals to be canvassed for public consultation. It raises the use of \u201cextended injunctive relief\u201d against copyright infringers, which would allow entities to seek injunctions directly against internet service providers (ISPs) to block websites. It also discusses different forms of \u201cextended authorisation liability\u201d that would penalise ISPs if they failed to take \u201creasonable steps\u201d to remove information when notified of infringements. The proposals have sparked considerable debate between rights-holders, the film and television industry and ISPs over their effectiveness and the responsibility for any costs they might incur. The chief executive of iiNet, David Buckingham, said blocking websites was not easy to oversee. \u201cI am worried about the ability for a law like that to be put in place, to be put in effect,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere will the checks and balances come from? Something like that needs to be very carefully monitored.\u201d He also questioned the effectiveness of an injunctive relief scheme. \u201cTechnology finds a way around those things and makes it hard for someone to pin things down.\u201d Buckingham was pressed repeatedly by Village Roadshow co-chief executive Graham Burke about throttling internet speeds for people who download content illegally, which iiNet does not support, but Village Roadshow favours. Burke said: \u201cIn Australia we\u2019re just saying slow the speed \u2026 my wife is a customer of yours and she has her speed cut down regularly.\u201d The Foxtel chief executive, Richard Freudenstein, warned that creative industries were at risk if action was not taken on copyright infringement. \u201cIf we sit and wait and we don\u2019t introduce some scheme soon there won\u2019t be an industry,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there aren\u2019t models that can make that work \u2026 there\u2019s going to be very, very different types of movies. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a lot more cats on skateboards and a lot less Game of Thrones.\u201d Brett Cottle, the chief executive of the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), said an \u201centire generation have gotten into the habit of believing that content is free\u201d. Turnbull, who led the discussion, said there would be extensive consultation before any legislation was brought forward, and stressed the importance of having a clear understanding of costs associated with any scheme. \u201cThis is an exercise in consultation, we\u2019re not drafting the law tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve sought to do is go beyond just putting up a whole bunch of submissions on a government websites.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
