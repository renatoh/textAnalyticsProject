It has had a presence in the UK since the early 80s and its first leader in Britain was Omar Bakri Mohammed, the radical Muslim cleric who went on to form the other organisation banned yesterday by Mr Blair, al-Mujahiroun. Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is said to have thousands of members in the UK, espouses radical views, calling for the overthrow of existing regimes in Muslim countries in favour of a return to the caliphate, a dictatorship based on Islamic law. But it makes much of its 50-year commitment to non-violent means. Banned in Germany and much of the Middle East, Hizb ut-Tahrir urged Muslims not to vote in the last general election in Britain and speaks out against American and British foreign policy. It does not recognise the state of Israel, but denies being anti-semitic. In October 2002, Fadi Abdelatif, a spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir in Denmark was convicted of distributing racist propaganda after handing out a leaflet apparently inciting violence against Jews in a square in Copenhagen. The leaflet, which until recently appeared on the organisation's UK website Khilafah.com, quotes a passage from the Qur'an [\"kill them wherever you find them ...\"] followed by a passage stating: \"the Jews are a people of slander ... a treacherous people.\" The organisation condemned the London bombings and has reaffirmed its commitment to non-violent means in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the city. It has spoken out against what it perceives as the targeting of Muslims since the bombings. The movement gains most of its recruits from mosques and universities, often targeting young disaffected Muslim youth. Ten years ago Hizb ut-Tahrir was banned from many UK university campuses but maintains an underground presence. Imran Waheed, spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir in the UK, said yesterday that the party had been engaged in non-violent political activity primarily against dictators in the Middle East. \"We have never accepted any form of armed struggle or killing of civilians despite the killing and death of many or our members in the Middle East.\" The common link between the organisations to be banned is Bakri Mohammed, a Syrian-born cleric expelled from Saudi Arabia as an extremist who arrived in Britain in 1986, settling in Tottenham, north London. He became the first British leader of Hizb ut-Tahrir in 1986 but left 10 years later to create al-Muhajiroun, a militant fringe group which advocated turning the UK into an Islamic state. The organisation is said to have been active in recruiting people to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq and called the September 11 hijackers \"the magnificent 19\". It has always represented a tiny minority of British Muslim opinion, claiming at one point to have 700 UK members. Bakri Mohammed, who has dual Syrian-Lebanese nationality, has been investigated by police over his allegedly inflammatory language, but no charges have been brought. When David Blunkett was home secretary he said in a written answer to the Commons that \"every word and statement\" the group made was being monitored. Last October, Bakri Mohammed announced he was disbanding al-Muhajiroun. He still tours the country giving speeches and makes statements on the internet. Until recently Bakri Mohammed supported the so-called covenant of security, an understanding among British Islamists that as long as the UK guarantees a degree of freedom to certain groups known to support terrorism, the country will not be a target for terrorist acts. But a few months ago Bakri Mohammed announced on the internet that British Muslims should understand that the covenant of security no longer existed because of the clampdown by the British government on various groups and individuals. Bakri Mohammed now says he is in retirement, but is said to lead the Saviour Sect (Ahl ul-Sunnah wal Jammah), one of the successor organisations of al-Mujahiroun also banned by Mr Blair yesterday. Another al-Muhajiroun offshoot to be banned is known as al-Ghurabaa, or the Strangers. Spokesman Abu Izzadeen this week refused to condemn the July 7 bombings. He said: \"What I would say about those who do suicide operations or martyrdom operations is they're completely praiseworthy. \"I have no allegiance to the Queen whatsoever or to British society; in fact if I see mujahideen attack the UK I am always standing with the Muslims, never against the Muslims.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
