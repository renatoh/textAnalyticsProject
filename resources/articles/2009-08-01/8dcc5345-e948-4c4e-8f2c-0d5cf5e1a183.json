A quarter of parents questioned say they are trying harder to ensure that everyone in the household eats the same meal to help keep costs down, while 48% of parents say they are eating out less frequently. One in six cited more family time as a side effect of the downturn. Changing Plates, based on research by the department of sociology at Oxford University and YouGov, and commissioned by Birds Eye, found that 67% of UK adults eat a meal with their families at least three times a week. Almost half do so every day. Staggered mealtimes, with children and parents eating at different times as a result of work or other commitments, still appear to be relatively uncommon. Four out of five parents in the study said that their children eat their evening meal with one or both parents \u2013 the same proportion as in the previous generation. Jonathan Gershuny, from the Department of Sociology at Oxford University, said: \"The findings of this report suggest that while the family meal is adapting and becoming more relaxed, the social significance of eating together remain.\" The report contradicts recent research from Debenhams that suggested the demise of the family dining occasion and basic manners such as eating with a knife and fork. Nearly all \u2013 95% \u2013 said table manners are important, but what constitutes good manners has changed with only 37% considering toilet humour, illness or injury impolite to discuss at the table. More than three out of five of those questioned said they ate their main meal at a table, and four out of 10 believed the TV should be switched off during mealtimes. Only 36% eat in front of the TV. More people have bought frozen food in the last six to 12 months, with 58% saying this was to save money, while 36% said it was to stop them wasting food."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
