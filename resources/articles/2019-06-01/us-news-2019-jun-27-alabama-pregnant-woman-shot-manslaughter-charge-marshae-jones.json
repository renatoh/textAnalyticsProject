Marshae Jones was reportedly five months pregnant when she was shot by another woman in December outside a shop in Pleasant Grove, near Birmingham. On Wednesday, Jones, 27, was indicted by a Jefferson county grand jury on a manslaughter charge and is expected to be held in Jefferson county jail on a $50,000 bond, while the woman accused of shooting her walked free, reported AL.com. The case has raised alarm among pro-choice groups who say it is shocking evidence of how the state\u2019s restrictive abortion laws are now being used against pregnant women. \u201cThe investigation showed that the only true victim in this was the unborn baby,\u2019\u2019 said Lt Danny Reid of Pleasant Grove police following the shooting, reported AL.com in December. \u201cIt was the mother of the child who initiated and continued the fight which resulted in the death of her own unborn baby.\u201d The Guardian has contacted Jefferson county district attorney\u2019s office for comment. It comes after the Alabama governor, Kay Ivey, signed a bill in May banning abortion in almost every circumstance \u2013 including rape and incest \u2013 posing a challenge to Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 supreme court judgment that guaranteed abortion rights across the nation. Alabama is one of 38 states with fetal homicide laws that recognize a fetus as a potential victim. It is also a \u201cstand-your-ground\u201d state, which means people are allowed to use physical force to defend themselves if their reason is considered \u201cjustifiable\u201d. The ruling has prompted outcry on Twitter \u2013 including from abortion groups, who spoke out in Jones\u2019s support. \u201cMarshae Jones was indicted for manslaughter for losing a pregnancy after being shot in the abdomen FIVE times. Her shooter remains free,\u201d wrote Alabama-based abortion group the Yellowhammer Fund on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get Marshae out of jail and assist with her legal representation.\u201d Ilyse Hogue, president of Naral Pro-Choice America, tweeted: \u201cMarshae Jones was indicted for homicide when someone shot her in the stomach while she was pregnant, ending her pregnancy. They said she \u2018started it.\u2019 The shooter went free. This what 2019 looks like for a pregnant woman of colour without means in a red state. This is now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
