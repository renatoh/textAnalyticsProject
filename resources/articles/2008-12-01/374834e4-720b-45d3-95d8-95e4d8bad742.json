Official confirmation that George and Laura Bush would return to the leafy Preston Hollow suburb where they lived before he became governor of Texas soon gave way to speculation, and then investigation. The Dallas Morning News reported that a four-bedroom house at the above address was purchased in October in the name of the Bush family accountant, Robert McClesky. The house also boasts \"four and a half bathrooms\", an American real estate euphemism which means the fifth bathroom hasn't got a bath in it, and is in fact just a toilet. The four bedrooms doesn't seem like quite enough, and suggests that either the Bushes don't want guests or aren't expecting any. They also appeared to have paid $3.1m for a house without a pool, even though a quick pry from above \u2013 courtesy of Google Earth \u2013 shows that almost all of the neighbours have impressive ones. Why? There is only one conclusion that can be drawn from this and, shocking as it is, it would also explain a lot: George Bush can't swim. The president always seemed like a man harbouring a dark secret. Could this be it? Have you ever seen pictures of him in the water? Didn't he seem slightly off-kilter when he went to watch the swimming at the Olympics? It all makes perfect sense. The alcohol rumours were merely a diversion. He was after a different kind of staying dry. There is but a single reference to Bush getting wet on the internet, a 1999 story about him running across a water moccasin while \"swimming\" in a pond at his ranch in Crawford. But there are no photos or independent witnesses, and the very word pond suggests that unlike the bulk of his time at the White House, on that occasion Bush was well within his depth. If his inability to swim is eventually confirmed, remember: you heard it here first. If it turns out not to be true, just forget where you heard it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
