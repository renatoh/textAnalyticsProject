I felt exactly the same when I arrived back in London last Monday after a weekend in the German capital. This is a total conversion for someone who five years ago couldn't stand the place. As every year goes by, getting around London gets harder, more frustrating and time-consuming, which means every time I go to Berlin it becomes a more attractive place. Underground trains glide into stations every few minutes - half empty, even in the so-called rush hour. The trains are wide and people are encouraged to bring their bikes (rather than being banned from doing so as on many London Underground routes). And unlike in London, you can get your bike, pushchair or wheelchair on the Tube with no effort - the stations have glass lifts that, wait for it, work. There are cycle paths that actually go somewhere (as opposed to petering out into a dangerous bus lane) and the fact that it is so easy to combine your journey between bike and U-bahn (underground) and S-bahn (overground) means that many people in Berlin don't need to use cars at all. The best bit last weekend, though, was going to the information desks at mainline stations. No queues. Several smiling staff in uniforms eager to help lost tourists, and computers that work out your journey for you. So, if you're in Alexanderplatz (the space-agey glass station in the former east of the city, which is light, airy and clean) and you want to go to an obscure village called Kaputh somewhere remote outside Potsdam, it's easy. They simply print you out a Fahrplanauskunft (journey planner). Not only does this tell you what time your train leaves, but from which platform, and gives a whole itinerary of your train connections with total journey times for each leg of the trip. Meanwhile London is deteriorating. To come to work I catch one overground train and two Tubes. They are all, always, packed. On my last trip back from Heathrow, pregnant, with luggage and a three-year-old asleep in a pushchair, the lifts weren't working at the Tube station. So I bumped the buggy up the stairs. A surge of commuters swarmed towards me, almost knocking me down. When the majority had passed, one slower, seventy-something woman started making her way up the stairs. 'I'd better help you with that pushchair,' she said, 'although why it's me of all people helping you is funny when you think about it, isn't it?' You may hate Ken Livingstone, but for me, the quicker the mayor of London brings in traffic congestion charges and puts more money into public transport the better. Just imagine a London with lifts and escalators that work! Even if he fails to improve things radically, at least someone is trying to do something about this mess."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
