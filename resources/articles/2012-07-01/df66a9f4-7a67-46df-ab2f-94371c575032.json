The high-profile television appearances on five major television networks mark an extremely rare step for the normally-media shy Romney. It amounted to the biggest damage-limitation exercise of the White House race so far. The danger for Romney is it may backfire, alerting millions to a row that until now most had been unaware of. He appeared rattled and on the defensive, which may not help his public image. Clearly upset over an issue that has escalated in the past 48 hours, he accused Obama of stooping to a new low and engaging in \"destructive\" politics. \"This is reckless and absurd on his part and it's something that's beneath his dignity,\" Romney said, contrasting this with Obama's pledge before becoming president in 2009 to raise the tone of politics. He claimed that Obama was using the Bain issue to divert attention from poor jobs figures. Obama, speaking shortly before the Romney interviews, kept up the pressure, saying the onus was on Romney to clear up questions about his role at Bain as soon as possible. The row is over Romney's claim that he ceded control of Bain Capital in 1999 when he left to run the 2002 Winter Olympics. The Boston Globe on Thursday published filings by Bain to the securities and exchange commission listing Romney as sole owner, chief executive and president of Bain until 2002. The issue of the timing is significant because several companies taken over by Bain between 1999 and 2002 saw lay-offs and closures, with jobs shipped to China, Mexico and other countries, dangerous charges for Romney in an election year in which unemployment is the top issue. The row escalated on Thursday morning when the Obama campaign held a phone conference for reporters in which they said Romney was lying to either the American public or the securities and exchange commission about the date when he left the company. They added that if it was the latter, this was potentially a criminal matter. Romney, in one of the television interviews, with CNN, stood by his claim that he left Bain in 1999."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
