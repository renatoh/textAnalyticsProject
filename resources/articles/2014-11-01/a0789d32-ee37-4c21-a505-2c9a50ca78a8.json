Pelembe, who plays for the South African side Mamelodi Sundowns, had several chances to give the Mambas a first victory in 14 matches against their bogey side, Chipolopolo. However, having seen two efforts from open play saved by his Sundowns club-mate Kennedy Mweene, the 31-year-old, who is known as Domingues in his homeland, was foiled early in the second half from the spot before Zambia scored late on to book their place at the finals in Equatorial Guinea. Newspapers in Mozambique\u2019s capital, Maputo, said Pelembe was taken to hospital with a fever and exhaustion. \u201cThe golden boy spent the night in a city hospital with high fevers and ill health, morally very shaken,\u201d reported Folha de Maputo. \u201cThe Zambian goalkeeper showed he was a true cat between the goals. Our boy wonder fired his kick but had it stopped and after that there was silence. Nobody could believe such disgrace.\u201d Mweene admitted afterwards that he had got lucky. \u201cHe is my team-mate and I know the side he goes to always. I took a chance and it went right,\u201d he said. \u201cI apologise to the people of Mozambique for the result and, as head of the technical team, take full responsibility,\u201d added the coach Joao Chissano. Mozambique rounded off their qualifying campaign on Wednesday by drawing 1-1 with Niger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
