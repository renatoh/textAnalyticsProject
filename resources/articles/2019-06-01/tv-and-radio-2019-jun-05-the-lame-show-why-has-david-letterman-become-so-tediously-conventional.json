It took place in April 1996, nine months after Letterman\u2019s rival Jay Leno had overtaken him in the ratings, and it tells us a lot about how he dealt with the pressure. During this episode, Letterman introduced a quick skit about a \u201cDavid Letterman doll\u201d, a floppy dummy in a double-breasted suit. The skit ended, and Letterman sat the doll in a chair. But, as he walked away, he circled back and punched it in the head. And then he did it again. And again. And again. And again. A minute later, he walked back and punched it another 10 times. Letterman\u2019s first guest that night was David Schwimmer; on introducing him, he unleashed another volley of punches at the dummy\u2019s head and invited Schwimmer to join him, screaming: \u201cGo ahead, teach him some manners!\u201d As the critic Jason Zinoman observes in his book Letterman: The Last Giant of Late Night, \u201cthe laughter got quieter. What was wrong with Dave?\u201d You can\u2019t help but think of the dummy-punching incident as you watch the second series of Letterman\u2019s Netflix show, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction, because there isn\u2019t a trace of that Letterman in it. He\u2019s absent. Sure, a Letterman is there, but it isn\u2019t the one you know. This Letterman is like the shadow that gets left on the wall after a nuclear bomb goes off. Especially if you were a Letterman fan, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction is a strange series to sit through. There are no jokes. There\u2019s no grouchiness. There is no longer any instinct for havoc. Instead, it\u2019s about a kindly old man being deferential to a succession of people who only partly deserve it. Take his interview with Kanye West, during which he sincerely compliments West\u2019s clothing line (\u201cI like the colour, I like the fit, I love the shoes,\u201d he coos to Kim Kardashian in a filmed segment), or his interview with Tiffany Haddish, where he clenches his fists with sincerity and says: \u201cYour talent is so powerful.\u201d The Letterman of old would have watched this show agape. He used to make his guests work for praise. Now he just wheels it out on a platter. The joy of old Letterman interviews was watching his guests struggle against him, whether they succeeded (when Cher called him an \u201casshole\u201d), or failed (when Letterman walked out midway through an excruciating Crispin Glover segment). But there\u2019s nothing for anyone to struggle against now. During his late-night days, Letterman was a subversive who looked like a straight. Now, with his cloudlike beard threatening to consume his body, he has become the opposite. He looks odd, but his interviews have become tediously, punishingly conventional. My Next Guest Needs No Introduction is so weirdly absent, so steadfastly unDave, that I have been trying to figure out what has happened. There\u2019s an argument, posed by Zinoman in a recent New York Times piece, that Letterman has simply gained some perspective. He\u2019s off the treadmill. He has realised that there\u2019s more to life than his show. \u201cLetterman doesn\u2019t seem interested in looking back so much as discovering new things,\u201d Zinoman writes. \u201cHe approaches these interviews with modesty, putting the spotlight on the guest, deferring to them, rarely challenging or probing too far.\u201d I wonder if there\u2019s something else at play, though. This is a part-time job for Letterman. He has a whole year to pick a handful of interviewees, so they\u2019re people he likes. However, on his late night shows, he was afforded no such luxury. Back then, like it or not, he had 10 people to talk to every week for 30 years, and they were slid under his nose by publicists and bookers depending on what project needed to be promoted. This conveyor belt of faces must have been exhausting, but it was also what gave him his bite. Letterman was never any good at hiding his feelings. When he was bored, we all knew it. When he was angry \u2013 as with the doll \u2013 we knew that, too. Throughout his career, the secret to Letterman\u2019s success was that he was always far more interesting than his guests. That\u2019s still the case, but Letterman no longer believes it. At the end of his new interview with Melinda Gates \u2013 an ordeal that feels about four hours long \u2013 Letterman claims to be jealous of her because she made a difference in the world, and he didn\u2019t. This is so myopic that it hurts. Letterman spent three decades forging the comedic sensibilities of a generation. It was his humour that informed shows, including Seinfeld and The Simpsons, that bled into their imitators, that bled into their imitators, and now it is just an immovable part of our culture. Directly or otherwise, Letterman changed how the world speaks. It\u2019s one hell of a legacy and, watching him on Netflix, you wish to God that he would embrace it. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 June 2019 because an earlier version referred to David Letterman spending three years forging the comedic sensibilities of a generation. This has been corrected to three decades."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
