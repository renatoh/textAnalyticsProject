He\u2019s now Twickenham\u2019s highest-scoring non-Englishman \u2013 and the All Blacks\u2019 all-time top World Cup scorer. FACT OF THE DAY Only one previous semi has been tighter \u2013 France\u2019s 9-8 win over Wales in 2011. STAT OF THE DAY 0: The number of their 33 tackles the All Blacks missed in the first half. SYMMETRY WATCH The new Jonah Lomu, Julian Savea, just can\u2019t shake off the tag. He\u2019s still stuck on 38 Test tries \u2013 none of them against South Africa \u2013 rather like Jonah, who finished up with 37, none against the Boks. LEAST WISE CHOICE Several Springboks players spent last week looking around London for match-winning inspiration \u2013 and tried to soak up some positive energy by watching one of the capital\u2019s elite sporting outfits in training. Sadly, that outfit was Chelsea. MOST OFF-MESSAGE Heyneke Meyer was asked after the game how much he\u2019s looking forward to the third-fourth play-off: \u201cIt is a bit like kissing your sister. It means nothing.\u201d BEST NEWS OF THE DAY Only seven days now until the final \u2013 meaning it\u2019s only seven days until the last ever public playing of Paloma Faith\u2019s petition-provoking take on World in Union. LET DOWN OF THE DAY Jason \u201cThe Fun Bus\u201d Leonard found himself next to Prince Philip in the posh seats. Sadly they were not mic\u2019d-up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
