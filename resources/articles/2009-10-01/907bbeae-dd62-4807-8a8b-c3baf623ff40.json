But the manager did betray an element of paranoia when he expressed the hope that Ireland could play the away leg of their tie first. \"Strange situations can happen when you play the second game away,\" he said. \"If you want to understand, you will understand.\" Ireland made sure of their place in next Monday's draw with a 2-2 home draw against the world champions Italy on Saturday, a result that followed Bulgaria's defeat in Cyprus. There was huge disappointment at the concession of Alberto Gilardino's 90th-minute equaliser, with John O'Shea, the Ireland defender, claiming Italy had not only \"got out of jail\" but had been \"let off the hook\". An Ireland victory would have raised faint hopes of them winning the group and qualifying automatically, although for that to happen, Italy would have had to have dropped points at home to Cyprus on Wednesday, with Ireland beating Montenegro at Croke Park. Both games are now dead rubbers. \"Italy should be under huge pressure for Wednesday and they're not,\" said O'Shea. There remains anger in Ireland at the Fifa president Sepp Blatter's decision to seed the play-off draw; he made the announcement only two weeks ago, as Ireland laboured under the misapprehension that the draw would be open. That means, in all likelihood, Ireland will play Russia, France, Greece or Portugal on 14 and 18 November as they will be among the non-seeds, which are to be based on the Fifa rankings. Russia and France are guaranteed to enter the play-offs as seeds while Greece and Portugal will join them if they beat Malta and Luxembourg respectively on Wednesday. Both Greece and Portugal are at home. Ireland draw strength from their unbeaten record thus far in what has been a testing group. \"When we played Italy in Bari and drew 1-1,\" Trapattoni said, \"they had 10 men [following Gianpaolo Pazzini's early sending-off] so they may have had an excuse but in Dublin, they had no excuses. I have achieved many things in my career but if this qualification were to happen, it would be one of my best achievements. I believe it can. We can beat anybody.\" \"There are tough teams,\" added the captain, Robbie Keane, \"and I'm sure we'll get one of the toughest. We never get an easy ride, do we?\" Trapattoni will be without the suspended Glenn Whelan for the Montenegro game but Damien Duff has returned to the squad after a calf problem. Yellow cards and suspensions carry over into the play-offs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
