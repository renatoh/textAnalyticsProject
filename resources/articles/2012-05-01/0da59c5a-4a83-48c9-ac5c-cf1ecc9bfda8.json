The poll findings were released by the former chancellor a few hours before Salmond launched his party's long-awaited \"Yes Scotland\" campaign for the referendum on independence in 2014, centred on a new public declaration supporting separation under the slogan \"Scotland's Future in Scotland's Hands\". The event at a multiscreen cinema in Edinburgh, billed as the largest community-based political movement in the country's history, will feature pro-independence celebrities and public figures including former Labour politicians such as the former Falkirk MP Dennis Canavan. SNP activists around Scotland are being trained to act as campaigners for independence, and urged to attempt to convert and persuade as many work colleagues, friends and family members in their areas as possible, and to lobby opinion formers in their community. In a deliberate attempt to undermine Friday's launch, Darling said that even though Salmond had held power for five years, the YouGov poll \u2013 paid for by the soon-to-be-launched anti-independence campaign \u2013 had confirmed that leaving the UK still appealed to a minority of voters. The YouGov poll of 1,004 people found that only 33% of Scots would opt for independence, while 57% would reject it, findings which are close to several recent surveys but show lower support for independence than others. In another damaging finding for the pro-independence movement, the poll also suggested that only 58% of people who voted for the SNP in last May's landslide victory for Salmond would back independence in a snap referendum, while 28% of SNP voters opposed it. \"Even after winning two Scottish general election victories, raising a war-chest of millions and deploying the full resources of the Scottish government, Alex Salmond has failed to convince Scots that they should leave the United Kingdom,\" Darling said. \"The nationalists will go to great lengths to try to prove there is a groundswell towards leaving the UK but the truth is that their campaign is stalled. Independence is as unpopular as it has ever been.\" The polling results will not greatly surprise the \"yes\" campaign but Darling's intervention marks the first head-on challenge for Salmond by the anti-independence coalition formed by the three main pro-UK parties of Labour, the Tories and the Liberal Democrats, which is expected to launch formally in June. Darling, who has confirmed he is setting up the pro-UK campaign, convened a private meeting of senior figures in all three parties at his home in Edinburgh earlier this month \u2013 an event lampooned by the first minister as a council of war with \"tea and sandwiches\". Sources close to this group said a series of initiatives was being put in place to counter Yes Scotland. Officials within Yes Scotland said their 30-month long campaign, which is being funded largely by two gifts worth nearly \u00a32m, was designed to slowly overcome the gap in support. A spokesman for Yes Scotland said: \"The independence referendum isn't being held tomorrow. The campaign launches tomorrow, and it will be the biggest community-based campaign that Scotland has ever seen.\" The direct challenge to Salmond could bolster the first minister's efforts to win support from outside the SNP by polarising the parties and the debate, helping the first minister overcome significant reservations already being voiced by potential supporters about the SNP's policies and tactics. Yes Scotland officials believe that Canavan's appearance alongside Salmond at the campaign launch will, as a popular former Labour MP, signal to many undecided Labour voters and trade unionists that independence is winning support on the mainstream left. \"Dennis has travelled the journey that we need lots of people in Scotland to travel: from a Labour MP to an independent in the Scottish parliament to standing on a yes platform in which he will make a substantial contribution,\" said the campaign's spokesman, Stephen Noon. \"He illustrates the sort of person who will be on display on that stage. People who have made journeys, from all sorts of different backgrounds.\" Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green party leader, confirmed he would be attending the launch and signing the declaration, but again warned Salmond that so far the yes campaign was too dominated by the SNP and its centrist policies, including floating support for Nato and continued exploitation of North Sea oil and gas. However, an influential non-party alliance of civic and voluntary groups called Future of Scotland, chaired by a former moderator of the Church of Scotland, Alison Elliot, urged both camps to wait for the voters to decide what sort of constitutional reform they wanted before launching their campaign. Elliot, the convenor of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, warned that running a campaign at this early stage risked boring and alienating voters. \"Politicians are jumping the gun,\" she said. \"They should be speaking to people and helping them understand what any change might mean for them. Only then should the campaigning start. If the parties retreat to their corners at this stage we could be subjected to more than two years of political squabbling and tribalism. \"Ideally, the referendum process should reflect what people want to see - a popular rather than political mandate. If people feel disengaged and ill-informed, we risk a repeat of the low voter turnout in the recent local elections and other Scottish elections. This would be a disaster for a referendum on Scotland's constitutional future.\" Angus Robertson, the SNP's campaign director, did not directly challenge the YouGov poll's findings but said it was essentially irrelevant, since the referendum was not being staged until the autumn of 2014. \"The referendum isn't happening tomorrow, as the poll tries to pretend. Today is the start of the biggest community-based campaign in Scotland's history, offering a positive, inclusive vision of Scotland's future as an independent nation \u2013 and we are extremely confident of winning the trust of the people and achieving a yes vote in autumn 2014. \"And Alistair Darling isn't even confident enough to ask the clear, straightforward question in the referendum consultation document. An independent Scotland will have the political and fiscal independence that we need to build a fair society and successful economy, while sharing a close social union with our friends and neighbours in England, including the Queen as our joint head of state.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
