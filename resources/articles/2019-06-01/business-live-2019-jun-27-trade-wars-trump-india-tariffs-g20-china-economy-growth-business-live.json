World leaders have gathered in Osaka, Japan, ahead of a likely storm G20 meeting dominated by trade disputes. Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Shinzo Abe, Theresa May, Justin Trudeau, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Giuseppe Conte and Pedro S\u00e1nchez, and more, have braved the wet and windy airfield at Osaka, for a crunch summit. Trump set the tone for the G20, via Twitter, by demanding that India withdraw new tariffs on US goods --- even though they were imposed in response to his own tariffs on India. Trump has also warned he could impose tariffs on all Chinese imports - an extra $325bn or so - if he isn\u2019t satisfied with Beijing\u2019s actions on trade. His economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, has echoed that claim today. He\u2019s also cast doubt on America\u2019s commitment to defending Japan -- causing another pillar in the world order to wobble slightly.... Financial markets will be watching the G20 meeting closely, hoping for progress in the trade disputes that have slowed global growth in recent months. China has reportedly drawn up a list of conditions to present the US, when Trump and Xi dine on Saturday night. They include ending the blacklisting of Huawei. Trump is also due to meet Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan during a busy schedule. The meeting with Erdo\u011fan is likely to be particularly fiery, given US concerns that Turkey is buying an anti-aircraft system from Russia. The climate emergency will also be on the agenda. May has told us that she\u2019ll be raising the issue with other world leaders, having recognised the impact of climate change. The G20 begins Friday morning Osaka time, or around midnight in the UK / early evening on the East Coast, so stay tuned to our website for more news. GW Investors around the globe are trying to square the White House\u2019s \u2018good-cop\u2019/\u2019bad-cop\u2019 commentary on the trade war with China, says analyst Ken Odeluga of City Index. Trump\u2019s \u201cPlan B\u201d is to \u201ctake in billions and billions of dollars a month\u201d more from China while doing \u201cless and less business\u201d with the second-largest economy. His Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin remained \u201chopeful\u201d on Wednesday. Other Washington hawks bat away Beijing\u2019s insistence on a \u2018balanced\u2019 deal. Little wonder that ample dissonance accompanies the wide expectation that a tariff ceasefire will be agreed this weekend. European stock markets have closed after a day of subdued trading. The Stoxx 600 index, which covers Europe\u2019s biggest companies, ended the day basically unchanged. Investors are hunkering down ahead of the formal start of the G20 summit on Friday. Healthcare and some consumer goods makers rallied, matching gains in America. That\u2019s because only two Democratic challengers to become the next US president backed the idea of replacing private health insurance with \u201cMedicare for All\u201d. Heads-up: One of Donald Trump\u2019s top advisors has warned that America could press on and raise tariffs on Chinese imports. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, has said America is insisting on \u2018structural changes\u2019 to China\u2019s intellectual property laws, with effective enforcement for any breaches. He told Fox News: \u201cIf need be, we may move ahead \u2013 we may move ahead on additional tariffs. However, Kudlow also claimed America hasn\u2019t set any \u2018preconditions\u2019 ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting on Saturday. This G20 summit is Theresa May\u2019s last big foreign trip before stepping down as PM. She\u2019s expected to hold meeting with Australian PM Scott Morrison, Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, South Africa\u2019s Cyril Ramaphosa and Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. Lots to discuss with that group! May\u2019s spokeswoman says she will raise the death of Jamal Khashoggi with MBS, and also press him on the need to de-escalate tensions with Iran. The UK court ruling that Britain\u2019s arms sales to Saudi Arabia are unlawful will probably also come up. The leaders of China and Japan, Xi Jinping and Shinzo Abe, have held a meeting in Osaka ahead of the G20 meeting. Although the handshake doesn\u2019t look too chummy, there are signs that relations may be warming. Abe told Xi that he hopes to welcome him to Japan soon: Around the time of the cherry blossoms next spring, I would like to welcome President Xi as a state guest to Japan, and hope to further elevate ties between Japan and China to the next level. In another hotel suite, Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner appeared to enjoy dinner with Australian PM Scott Morrison: During the dinner, president Trump congratulated Scott Morrison on his \u201ctremendous victory\u201d at the Australian federal election. Trump declared he\u2019d expected it all along.... \u201cHe didn\u2019t surprise me but he surprised a lot of other people. \u201cSee, I knew him. See, I said you\u2019re going to do very well, and he did, he did that. \u201cThey called it an upset but I don\u2019t call it an upset ... I want to congratulate you very much, it was a fantastic thing.\u201d Morrison\u2019s critics don\u2019t share Trump\u2019s enthusiasm, I fear, after the Australian PM announced plans to cut regulations - on top of planned tax cuts. All very Trumpian.... World leaders have continued to arrive in Osaka - including the heads of Italy and Spain. Big news in the UK car sector -- Vauxhall\u2019s Ellesmere Port plant in the North West of England has won the chance to manufacture its new Astra vehicle. That\u2019s a big win for the plant, which employs 1,100 people, and has beaten off competition from a rival plant in Gliwice, Poland. BUT there\u2019s a catch... the plan is conditional on the terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. That suggests that a no-deal Brexit would scupper the plan. Vauxhall\u2019s owner, PSA, says: The decision on the allocation to the Ellesmere Port plant will be conditional on the final terms of the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union and the acceptance of the New Vehicle Agreement, which has been negotiated with the Unite Trade Union. PSA has also decided to manufacture the new Astra at its factory in Russelsheim, Germany. Motoring journalist Richard Aucock says it\u2019s a real boost for the UK auto industry. Donald Trump is due to hold meetings with a series of world leaders at the G20 summit -- including several fellow \u2018strong men\u2019. Top of the list is president Xi Jinping. If the WSJ is right, Xi will urge Trump to accept China\u2019s proposals to pause the trade war and resume talks. The success, or otherwise, of those talks will swiftly move the financial markets. Trump will also speak with Vladimir Putin - the first face-to-face meeting since the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election concluded. He\u2019s also due to have a \u201cworking breakfast\u201d Saturday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - where rising tensions with Iran will surely be discussed. It\u2019s just been confirmed that America\u2019s economy grew at a steady pace in the first quarter of 2019. US GDP expanded at an annualised rate of 3.1% in January-March, says the commerce department in its latest assessment, matching earlier readings. The figures show that trade made a positive contribution to growth, with exports up 5.4% and imports down 1.9%. That should please the White House, and may show that president Trump\u2019s trade war is having an impact - forcing US consumers and businesses to buy less from abroad. However, the report also shows that consumer spending slowed, rising by just 0.9% in the quarter. Spending on durable items, such as cars and computers, declined by 2.4%. Businesses expanded their inventories, boosting growth, while investment by companies also rose. Donald Trump is also due to meet Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan at the G20. That could be a challenging meeting, as the US is preparing sanctions on Turkey if it goes ahead with the purchase of a Russian anti-aircraft missile system. Kim Catechis, portfolio manager at Legg Mason affiliate Martin Currie, predicts fireworks: \u201cWhilst Turkey is facing some serious fundamental challenges, geopolitical events are complicating matters further. Ankara and Washington are on a collision course over the imminent deployment of Russian missiles and its support for Iran, Russia and Qatar versus the US- supported Saudi Arabia and Israel. \u201cTrump and Erdogan are meeting at the G20 in Japan this weekend. We expect this meeting to be fiery and believe it will result in sanctions, knocking investor confidence even further.\u201d Donald Trump has been whisked from the airport to dinner, with Australia\u2019s prime minister Scott Morrison (fresh from his re-election). On the US side of the table is US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, national security advisor John Bolton and trade representative Robert Lighthizer, along with White House advisors Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. Morrison is accompanied by finance minister Mathias Cormann, trade minister Simon Birmingham and Australia\u2019s Washington ambassador Joe Hockey. Morrison is expected to urge Trump to end the trade war with China. Yesterday he vowed that Australia wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cpassive bystander\u201d, saying: \u201cThe impact of any further deterioration of the relationship will not be limited to these two major powers. The balance between strategic engagement and strategic competition in the US-China relationship has shifted. This was inevitable.\u201d Despite the UN finding \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that Saudi Arabia is responsible for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year, crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is still welcome at the G20 meeting. MBS has landed at Osaka, where he\u2019s expected to meet with Donald Trump on Saturday. European stock markets have dropped into the red, as investors worry that Donald Trump will not accept China\u2019s reported demands to end the trade war. The EU-wide Stoxx 600 is now down 0.2%, with losses in London, Paris and Amsterdam (all down around 0.4%). Significant news on the trade war: China is planning to present Donald Trump with the proposed terms of a settlement to end their trade war. That\u2019s according to the Wall Street Journal, which is reporting that Beijing has drawn up several conditions, including Removing its blacklist on Huawai, which bans US firms from selling technology to the Chinese firm Removing all the tariffs recently imposed on Chinese imports into America Dropping efforts to force China to buy more US goods. These are quite significant demands -- it\u2019s not clear that Trump would accept them, unless China is also making major concessions on, say, forced technology transfers and access to its economy. The WSJ says: The U.S. chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, and his Chinese counterpart, Liu He, talked by telephone this week on ways to get the talks back on track and expect to meet in person in advance of the presidents\u2019 Saturday lunch meeting after a Group of 20 summit in Osaka, said people familiar with the discussions. It is far from clear what the two will manage\u2014and whether their bosses will approve their work. Despite his preconditions, Mr. Xi isn\u2019t expected to take a confrontational tone with Mr. Trump, according to the Chinese officials. Rather, they say, he will sketch out what he envisions as an optimal bilateral relationship, which includes China\u2019s help on security issues vexing to the U.S., especially Iran and North Korea. Air Force One has touched down in Osaka, bringing Donald Trump and his entourage to the G20 meeting. The President has just left the plane, walked down the steps clutching an umbrella (luckily for him, the wind has died down a little). His daughter Ivanka was close behind. They\u2019re now in an armoured car (the famous high-tech \u201cBeast\u201d, I think), leaving the airport. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been spotted in Osaka, having stopped off in India for meetings on his way to the G20 summit. Pompeo seemed to enjoy his trip to New Delhi, declaring that the partnership between the US and India is \u201calready beginning to reach new heights\u201d -- ironically, just before Trump\u2019s tweet threatened to undermine it. As Pompeo put it yesterday: Great friends are bound to have disagreements. The United States has been clear we seek greater market access and the removal of trade barriers in our economic relationship. And today, I address these differences in the spirit of friendship and I think that the two of us will be able to see a good outcome for each of our two countries,\u201d The stormy weather at Osaka airport may, alas, match the mood inside the G20 summit over the next few days. Donald Trump has now picked fights with three major international rivals: Telling India to reverse its new tariffs on some US imports Threatening more tariffs on China, while claiming its economy is going down the tubes Criticising America\u2019s pledge to defend Japan, claiming it is one-sided as Japan \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to help us at all\u201d and \u201ccan watch it on the Sony television.\u201d The AFP newswire sets the scene.... US President Donald Trump set the tone Thursday for what promises to be a stormy G20 summit by lashing out at friends and foes alike over trade tariffs and foreign policy. The long-running US-China trade war looked set to dominate the two-day meeting of world leaders in Osaka from Friday but clashes also loomed over climate and a series of hotspots ranging from North Korea to Iran. On board Air Force One en route to Japan, Trump fired off a characteristically bullish tweet, chiding long-standing ally India for \u201cunacceptable\u201d tariffs on American goods. The first casualty of the G20 meeting appears to be umbrellas, as the Osaka weather strikes. This appears to be Sky\u2019s diplomatic editor, Dominic Waghorn, getting off Theresa May\u2019s plane. Hopefully he can put any damage on expenses.... Donald Trump raised the heat ahead of his meeting with president Xi, by claiming that China\u2019s economy was \u201cgoing down the tubes\u201d. But is he right, or is this just White House hyperbole? My colleague Martin Farrer has dug into the data, and explains all here: Anyone attending the G20 meeting needs to have packed their best warm, waterproof clothes. World leaders arriving at Kansai airport in Izumisano city, Osaka, are getting a wet and windy reception - umbrellas and coats are certainly required. Over in Osaka, world leaders have been arriving ahead of the G20 summit (which runs from Friday to Saturday). India\u2019s leader, Narendra Modi, has already met with Japan\u2019s Shinzo Abe -- I wonder if Trump\u2019s tweet came up.... Government spokesman Raveesh Kumar has said the pair discussed \u201ca broad range of topics of mutual interest\u201d, after enjoying a warm handshake and hug. European stock markets have also risen this morning, boosted by hopes of a US-China trade ceasefire. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index is up 0.2%, lifted by gains in Italy and Germany. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says the G20 summit in Osaka is crucial for market prospects this summer: This weekend is extremely important for the future direction of global stock markets. The G20 summit will include trade talks between the US and China and investors will be looking for any sign that the two countries can sort out their differences. It\u2019s worth reiterating that India only hiked tariffs on US goods in retaliation for America imposing new tariffs on its steel and aluminium exports. Narendra Modi\u2019s government had sought an exemption to those tariffs (which Donald Trump imposed as part of his plan to support American steelmakers). But when they were rebuffed, India import tariffs on more than 20 items from the US \u2014 including almonds, apples, walnuts, chickpeas and phosphoric acid. Bloomberg\u2019s Shawn Donnan suggests Trump should have mentioned this.... India\u2019s stock market is taking Trump\u2019s trade tweet in its stride. The SENSEX index has gained 168 points to 39,760, a rise of 0.44% - taking it close to this month\u2019s record high. But investors will be watching events in Osaka, Japan closely over the next few days as it hosts the G20. Saurabh Jain of SMC Global Securities explains: \u201cMarkets are jittery due to the uncertainty coming from the trade tiffs between U.S. and China and markets will continue to be cautious till the conclusion from the G20 meeting comes out. Intriguingly, the South China Morning Post is reporting that Washington and Beijing have \u201ctentatively agreed\u201d a trade war truce. This ceasefire (if confirmed), would give them a window of opportunity to resume negotiations to end the trade war. The SCMP says: Details of the agreement are being laid out in press releases in advance of the meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Osaka, Japan, this weekend, according to three sources \u2013 one in Beijing and two in Washington. Such an agreement would avert the next round of tariffs on an additional US$300 billion of Chinese imports, which if applied would extend punitive tariffs to virtually all the country\u2019s shipments to the United States. Stock markets are rising today, on hopes of trade war progress at the G20 meeting. China\u2019s CSI 300 index has risen by 1%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei gained 1.2%. The rally comes after US treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin claimed that the US and China were 90% of the way towards a trade deal. Donald Trump\u2019s tweet about India\u2019s tariffs has set the tone for the G20 summit, taking place on Friday and Saturday. The Indian government isn\u2019t accepting Trump\u2019s criticism, reports Reuters: India\u2019s tariffs are not that high compared to other developing countries, Indian government sources told Reuters on Thursday, reacting to United States President Donald Trump\u2019s call to withdraw what he said were very high tariffs. Earlier Trump tweeted that he looked forward to meeting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G20 summit in Japan, but said that for years India had put \u201cvery high tariffs against the United States\u201d. Adding: \u201cThis is unacceptable and the tariffs must be withdrawn!\u201d This month, India slapped higher tariffs on 28 U.S. products in retaliation for Washington\u2019s withdrawal this month of tariff-free trade for certain Indian goods. India\u2019s tariffs are in line with the World Trade Organization rules, the government sources said, adding that U.S. tariffs on some items were much higher than India\u2019s. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The threat of a global trade war is looming over the markets today, as world leaders prepare for a crunch meeting in Japan. Donald Trump has raised the stakes ahead of the G20 summit, threatening his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi. Although Trump proudly claims to be a \u201ctariff man\u201d, he doesn\u2019t like it when other people play the same trick. Trump is unhappy that India has just imposed tariffs on 28 US products, including almonds and apples. The new duties, some as high as 70%, are a tit-for-tat retaliation for America\u2019s refusal to exempt Delhi from higher taxes on steel and aluminium imports. So, in a tweet blasted off en-route to the G20 meeting in Osaka, Trump has announced he\u2019ll have a stern word with Modi over the issue - demanding these tariffs are removed. Trump already had China and Vietnam in his spotlight. Yesterday, he declared that he was quite prepared to impose tariffs on all Chinese goods (currently more than $300bn has been spared so far). He told Fox Business Network. \u201cChina\u2019s economy is going down the tubes \u2013 they want to make a deal..... \u201cYou have another $325bn that I haven\u2019t taxed yet \u2013 it\u2019s ripe for taxing, for putting tariffs on.\u201d Trump also threatened to drag Vietnam into his trade war, expressing unhappiness that some firms are dodging the tariffs on Chinese goods: \u201cA lot of companies are moving to Vietnam, but Vietnam takes advantage of us even worse than China. So there\u2019s a very interesting situation going on there.\u201d Investors have been crossing their fingers, hoping that Trump would agree a ceasefire with China during the G20 meeting - he\u2019s due to meet president Xi on Saturday. There has been chatter that the US could suspend any further tariffs while a deal is stuck - although Trump\u2019s comments on Fox don\u2019t really bear that out.... Also coming up today, we get a new eurozone economic confidence report, and updated US growth figures for the January-March quarter. The agenda 10am BST: Eurozone economic confidence figures for June 1pm BST: German inflation data for June 1.30pm BST: US GDP for Q1 2019 (third estimate)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
