The co-founder and master distiller behind Sipsmith, the micro-distillery in the vanguard of the craft gin movement in the UK, is contemplating the possibility of graphic warning photographs and plain packaging appearing on bottles of alcohol, akin to the restrictions on tobacco that assume full force in May. \u201cAre they considering similar labels for bacon? Fish and chips? Crisps?\u201d he demands. \u201cIt\u2019s an absurdity. It will crush the craft side of the industry. It will shift the business back to the industrial producers, who will be very happy to move people back to mass-produced drinks. If something like this comes through we won\u2019t be able to weather it.\u201d In December, a report from the government advisory body Public Health England suggested that bottles of alcohol could be sold in plain packaging and carry larger health warnings, including photographic warning labels. This month, public health groups called for a ban on all alcohol advertising in the UK and a study published last week by the University of Liverpool recommended placing warning labels on the front of bottles and using plain packaging to emphasise the risks associated with excessive drinking. Under current arrangements, there are no mandatory requirements for alcohol labelling, although a voluntary \u201cresponsibility deal\u201d requires the drinks industry to include warning labels indicating the unit alcohol content, the chief medical officer\u2019s alcohol guidelines and a pregnancy warning. For some campaigners and health professionals, self-regulation and the use of labels with questionable effectiveness is not enough. \u201cThere\u2019s been a long and sorry history of the drinks industry drawing up voluntary agreements with government and failing to deliver,\u201d said Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, who chairs the Alcohol Health Alliance. \u201cThere needs to be proper balanced information about the calorie content, health risks and guidelines. The public has a right to know that there is a significant link between alcohol and some cancers.\u201d Sarah Hanratty, interim chief executive of the Portman Group, which administers the industry\u2019s code of practice and set up the Drinkaware website, argues that self-regulation does have teeth. \u201cThere are strong commercial sanctions for companies that break the rules and products can be removed from shelves,\u201d she said. \u201cBanning alcohol marketing or calling for plain packaging is not the answer and will only serve to damage Britain\u2019s thriving creative industries.\u201d One industry that has already voiced alarm at the possibility of plain packaging and warning labels is the design sector. \u201cWhat would a beautiful bar look like if the back bar was all plain packaging?\u201d asked designer and brand consultant Ron Cregan, who has worked in the industry for over 25 years. \u201cWould the iconic shape of the champagne bottle have to change?\u201d Cregan is so alarmed that he has got together with like-minded professionals to form a group called Endangered Species to respond to the challenges that may lie ahead: \u201cThis has been on my radar for the last 15 years. We\u2019re trying to create a forum so that when it comes to the table we can have a debate. We need to gather our best brains,\u201d he said. \u201cIt goes to who we are and how we live and celebrate life. I want to live in a world that\u2019s culturally and socially rich. There\u2019s a kind of semi-religious tone to this. It\u2019s highly sanctimonious.\u201d Chris Record, a liver specialist at Newcastle University who started the campaign for better labelling on alcohol products in 2004, denies that there is anything self-righteous about his work. \u201cWe\u2019re not temperance people at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind people drinking, we just don\u2019t want them to drink excessively and the only way to get this message across is to give them the information. The public has a right to know. We don\u2019t want to interfere with their branding. We just want them to provide the information which they have failed to do voluntarily, so it needs to be mandatory in some form.\u201d Some observers see the debate around alcohol packaging as the inevitable consequence of the controls placed on tobacco. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be possible unless cigarettes hadn\u2019t happened first,\u201d said Christopher Snowdon of the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank. \u201cThe debates around the tobacco advertising ban 15 years ago were that this was not a precedent, it will never happen with anything else, and yet last week the there were health campaigners saying the same thing should happen with alcohol.\u201d Craft spirit branding specialist Michael Vachon, who set up Maverick Drinks, sees an unintended consequence of any attempt to hinder branding. \u201cCertainly it would harm what is a burgeoning entrepreneurial scene,\u201d he said. \u201cPackaging plays a big part in being able to sell the product. I\u2019d love to be able to say that the taste of the product is everything but it\u2019s simply not the case. The packaging is a big part of why people trade up to craft brands. If you remove branding and packaging, people will trade down in terms of quality, and that would have the opposite of the intended effect. I\u2019m sure government bodies would prefer people to drink better and less rather than cheaper and more.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
