Your mother's down for a visit. Conversation is flowing. Your friend is recounting the horror of her last house move. Your mother starts talking about furniture removers and how they found her vibrator lodged behind a chest of drawers. The guests laugh affectionately. You are six months pregnant. You are stone cold sober. You are undergoing mild shock. I know that these days, if you're not tying your partner to the bed and whipping him with a string of pork sausages, you're practically out of the loop in terms of a spicy sex life. And I'm not saying my mother isn't as entitled as anyone, but the positioning of \"granny-to-be\" and vibrator was almost too much for my hormonally loaded system to bear. That night, I realised that in the months of obsessing about becoming a mother, I hadn't given a thought about how she would make the journey from mother to grandmother. This would turn out to be the start of a bumpy ride. Knickers would get into twists, communication would falter and a whole plot of mistaken identity would emerge. I wasn't expecting my mother to morph into a bosomy, egg-custard-tart-baking, slipper-wearing homemaker, although this had been the standard set by my own grandmothers. One look at her flat would have put that idea to bed. You wouldn't have to be on the staff of the National Childbirth Trust to guess that the glass-topped tables, cream leather sofas and freezer stuffed with the entire Weight Watchers range were not chosen with tiny feet in mind (and that's without inadvertently spreading your toast with the chocolate body paint you mistook for Nutella in the fridge). Researchers from the Future Foundation found that modern grandparents are just as likely to prioritise travelling and other kinds of new experiences as they are to spending time with grandchildren. So while I didn't expect her to bin the lingerie and take to popping by with hot apple pies, I was beginning to wonder how we were going to fit into our new roles. How was this sexual, affluent, fashionable older woman with more to her identity than the birthing and raising of babies going to cope with becoming a grandmother? Shortly after the vibrator incident, my mother announced she wasn't going to be called gran, granny, nanny, ninny, nan or any other derivative of that status. \"I want him to call me Mavis,\" she asserted, using her \"don't-you-argue-with-me-madam\" voice. \"But you're going to be his gran whether you like it or not,\" I muttered. \"Don't be silly, Anne, that's so old-fashioned. I'd rather to be more like a friend to him,\" she replied. I didn't have the energy to add that the baby was hardly going to be joining her for outdoor ciggies, and that it would be some time before he had a view on Atkins v GI. I knew what she was fighting against. It wasn't really about me or about my pregnancy. It wasn't even the baby that bothered her; it was what the baby meant that did. All the sex toys and dieting in the world couldn't stop the baby from shuffling her up a generation, and although it was inevitable, she wasn't accepting it without a fight. I felt that not only was my unborn son losing a gran but also that I was somehow losing my mother. It was a lonely feeling. As I was trying to find the mother within me, my own mother seemed to be desperately trying to cast her new role off. \"You can't really blame her,\" my best friend joked, \"it's all right for you. You can go from Lady with the Lump to Yummy Mummy. What's out there for her? All she's got is a Stannah stairlift with her name on it.\" I knew what she meant: it's official, motherhood rocks (provided they squeeze back into their size 10 skinnys and don't blether on about episiotomy scars, piles and other downstairs traumas). Despite the fact that the average age for people to have their first grandchild is now 49, we still seem to imagine that a granny's place is behind her knitting needles. I muddled on through my pregnancy, working too hard, obsessing about buggies and birthing pools, forgetting to do my pelvic floor exercises and developing a curious respect for raspberry leaf tea. The gran debate remained unresolved, unspoken and consigned to the rotting heap of \"Issues I must get round to dealing with before the baby is born\". My husband and I carried on with the emotional and practical mechanics of two people becoming three and retreated more and more into a loved-up bubble of our own. So it was a shock to hear my mother remarking wistfully to my brother-in-law, \"I know they don't really need me to help but I feel very much on the outside. When Anne was born, my mum stayed with me for a fortnight.\" I was sad and confused. Was I punishing her for not wanting to be called gran or was it yet another example of facing up to the changes of the modern age? Kate Figes, in Life After Birth, noted that in 1951 nearly a half of all new mothers were being helped by their mothers. In 1985, this had fallen to a quarter. It's not surprising: we live further apart these days and our self-sufficiency is the holy grail of the post-feminist legacy. So it was with us. My mother lives and works in Manchester; I'm in London. Her boyfriend leaves the room at the mere mention of breastfeeding. My husband has to be physically restrained from buying up the complete contents of Waterstone's parenting section. In my father's time, the women just got on with it. Nowadays, expectant and new dads alike sense the primitive erotic power of man and babycarrier and realise the trade-in value of one full vacuuming of the house (in case you're in any doubt, to my mind this trades for at least three loads of laundry, but then again I hate vacuuming). We were the modern couple, tenderly negotiating the balance of power and expecting equal rights to the Pampers. Locked in our baby-making life, it hadn't occurred to either my husband or myself to depend on our mothers for practical or emotional post-birth support. In the end, as usual, biology had its own way. It was my uterus that decided things. It chose to soften and contract with increasing urgency over a big, family Easter dinner. While my baby was being born in hospital, my mother mopped up my broken waters from the bedroom floor, disinfected the mattress and tackled the Kilimanjaro of laundry. My son arrived early so she sorted through the debris of carrier bags and created a nursery. For the first time in 10 years, my house was stocked with ironed socks and tea towels as my mother displaced her anxiety via an orgy of housework. When my husband was finally crowbarred out of the hospital, she heated up a readymeal and they celebrated the birth in the time-honoured fashion of getting thoroughly and sentimentally pissed. When she saw the baby for the first time the next day, her face softened with instant, deep, metabolic love. It was a look that healed all things and marked her relationship as gran regardless of what she wanted to be called. I realised that I didn't need to let her in or to make a space for her in my baby's life. It was there already, etched along with all the other identities she had made and would carry on creating for herself. We had worried, we had argued but we hadn't factored in the one thing that would change everything. It had taken this little person to sort things out. He hadn't done it by reason, sociological analysis or emotional blackmail. He had just been born, and that in itself had been enough. Seven months later, my mother went on holiday with a female friend to Tunisia. On her return she posted a tiny soft camel to my son.
