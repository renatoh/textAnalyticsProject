The flag that hangs on it looks small against the rippled black material, through whose dark gauze you glimpse shattered architecture. If this were by Christo, it would be considered art. And it is art, one of the many spontaneous, emotional pieces of vernacular Americana that have sprung up around Ground Zero and elsewhere in New York since September 11 2001. Almost a year on, as the site of the atrocity awaits its future, the fences around it are still covered with handwritten messages, photographs of the disappeared, souvenir T-shirts people have taken off and hung there. And then there are the more commercial contributions. Plenty of art has been made about September 11, and is visible all over New York. The stalls outside the Metropolitan Museum on Central Park selling black-and-white photographs of the city's bridges and skyline now also sell framed photographs and paintings of rescue workers raising the stars and stripes at Ground Zero, and the twin shafts of light that shone in the night sky from the site earlier this year. There is plenty of low art around, and a huge demand for it. But there is not yet more than a glimmering of high, art-world art about the destruction of the twin towers. That, of course, is too much to ask. The first, tentative efforts by New York artists to respond to the scale of the thing are hideously upstaged by the raw facts. At the International Centre of Photography on Sixth Avenue, artist Kevin Clark has collaborated with amateur photographer Mikey Flowers (a nickname - he has a flower shop near Ground Zero) on a project called Dust to DNA. Clark works with genetic information, creating DNA portraits in which people are represented by their genetic code. He has printed the codes of September 11 survivors over the hurried, shocking photographs that Mikey Flowers took that day. This \"art\" element adds little to the images. The photographs' terrible information of dust, crushed vehicles, panicked escapers and blotted-out sky exceeds the attempt to transform them into anything symbolic. This much can already be said about September 11 and American art: it will change art's relation to the photograph. Since the late 1970s, photography has been the meat and drink of American artists - but photography shorn of its older traditions of documentary and reportage, photography understood as a fictive, composed medium that artists are free to use to create their own narratives. At the Guggenheim Museum, a catch-all survey of contemporary art reaffirms this unquestioningly. New York this summer is full of American out-of-towners, come to take a patriotic holiday in a city they may never have seen before. At the Guggenheim a guard, tired of being asked where the proper paintings are, explodes and shouts at an elderly couple that this is a modern-art museum. Elsewhere in Frank Lloyd Wright's gallery, a group of families, teenagers and pensioners listens to a lecturer explaining current ideas about the photograph. He points out how the images in this exhibition are consciously fictive, how they do not claim to give reliable information but rather to make us aware of the constructed nature of the photograph. He sounds as if he were talking a thousand years ago, about some other world. You wonder how anyone can have patience with such intellectual meanderings in front of the wave upon wave of undigested, indigestible visual reportage of the events of September 11 that bombards the eye in New York. Photographs taken by professionals and amateurs of every stage of the World Trade Centre's destruction are omnipresent, whether in expensive, wanly elegant books stacked up at Barnes and Noble or in cheap tourist ephemera. In SoHo, people still stream through Here Is New York, a photography exhibition about September 11 that began in an empty store in October last year. It is an open submission show based on the idea, say its organisers, that \"to restore our equilibrium we need to develop a new way of... making sense of all of the images which have besieged us and continue to haunt us\". America is a visual culture, used to feasting on images in a way the British have never considered quite polite. American eye-candy has had the rest of the world staring for a long time now. And New York is the capital of the eye. It is the city of sublime skyline vistas and a unique high art that since the early 20th century has responded to Manhattan's visual and spatial intoxication. Now the city has a new visual spectacle to glut on. In Britain the images of that day were replayed for a while, then shifted to the realm of memory; in New York no escape from them is in sight. Asked to suggest a memorial for Ground Zero, the artist Tony Oursler satirically proposed two scaffolding towers playing TV images of the attacks on a loop for a fixed period and then \"maybe it should all be buried\". There is an aspect of this that seems obscene even to mention after the murder of 3,000 people. But the attack on the World Trade Centre was also an attack on New York as an aesthetic fact: on the New York skyline, the 20th century's most seductive and recognisable symbol of modernity. Perhaps now, almost a year on, it is permissible to say that this, too, was part of the horror; that New York's beauty - something to be defended - has been horribly violated. When Piet Mondrian migrated to Manhattan during the second world war, he painted one of the most optimistic works of the 20th century, Broadway Boogie-Woogie: a dancing, abstract vision of the Manhattan street grid speckled with vibrant colours, the utopia he glimpsed inside the city's hard reality. Its vistas, after September 11, remain stunning. Central Park is still lovely; the Chrysler Building still glimmers in the sun. Can all this really be dwarfed by one morning's devastation? Because that's what seems to be happening, in the world's imagination, at the stalls selling images of the smoking, twisted remnant of one of the towers. This is the image of New York everyone now carries with them. And this is what art in New York has to contend with. New York, more than any other modern city, is a work of art, and the artists for which the city is famous - Pollock, de Kooning, Oldenburg - recognised that. Now it all seems to have been made to look small, quaint, vulnerable. Near Ground Zero, in an exhibition in the lobby of a Wall Street bank, you can see works by Warhol, Basquiat, Lichtenstein, Jeff Koons, Donald Judd and other giants of the city's art history. I went there from the site of the World Trade Centre, and this tour of classic New York art, designed to affirm the city, felt like a weak gesture. The same problem undermined the Jewish Museum's New York: Capital of Photography, one of several shows of classic images of New York at which New Yorkers and visitors are offered the therapeutic chance to see some of the defining images of the modern world's most represented city. Weegee's crowded beach at Coney Island in 1940, Edward Steichen's 1904 photograph of the Flatiron Building through winter trees: these are the pictures you would rather have in your mind's eye than those from last September. And then, in the Jewish Museum, you come across just one photograph from September 11, and all the great images of the city's modern past seem to be fantasy. Yet outside in Central Park, or nearby in the white spiral of Wright's Guggenheim, they seem true enough. Manhattan's beauty is a fact, as is its love of art. Despite dire predictions, the city's gallery culture has recovered spectacularly. On a summer Saturday, the streets of Chelsea are filled with would-be gallery-goers disappointed that the gallerists have decamped to the Hamptons. Rituals are preserved. This has been a bull year for New York exhibitions, with Gerhard Richter's retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art and Wim Delvoye's Cloaca (a machine that makes shit) at the New Museum among the crowd-pullers. Modern art in New York has always defined itself against crass patriotism; you come to New York to escape that. As much as ever, current exhibitions fall over themselves to be internationalist, to criticise the global economy. The opening show at the temporary Moma in Queens, about time zones in world art, gets all twisted up trying to remind Americans of the inequalities of globalisation. In this moment of patriotism, New York galleries are full of skewed views of America. Artist Gregory Crewdson curated a show at Barbara Gladstone, called American Standard, full of all-American weirdness - an Edward Hopper railway siding, a Diane Arbus Disneyland. Meanwhile, a fetid swamp of recent American history was excavated in Banks Violette's stylishly grotesque Arroyo Grande 7.22.95, at the Team gallery. The title, which can only be read as a sidelong reference to September 11, commemorates another horror, the murder of 15-year-old Elyse Marie Pahler by three heavy-metal-addicted teenage boys. Forty years ago, when American art was infinitely bolder than it is today, artists had no trouble dealing with contemporary events which, if minor next to September 11, were national shocks. Within months of Marilyn Monroe's suicide in 1962 James Rosenquist and Andy Warhol exhibited elegiac portraits; soon after Kennedy's murder in 1963 Robert Rauschenberg made history paintings. Today there is no artist in America with the intellect or arrogance to carry off anything comparable. Instead, art in New York now seems a collective ritual: the content of videos and installations is not that important. Rather, walking around Chelsea, enjoying art, is a practical reassertion of what makes New York New York. The aesthetic weakness of today's American art is turning out to be a social strength. Sitting in a darkened warehouse in Chelsea, you see unroll upon the walls nocturnal images shot by Bruce Nauman of his studio after hours. Occasionally a mouse scurries at the corner of your visual field; swivel your chair and it is gone. Nauman subtitles the piece Fat Chance John Cage. It is the kind of art that ought, after September 11, to feel irrelevant: this is what American artists were doing on the eve of disaster, filming mice in their studios. In fact, it is deeply, sweetly reassuring; a relaxed, civil way to spend a Saturday morning. Perhaps at the moment that is all artists can offer New York, and all it requires of them. Art may not have risen to the historical occasion as yet, but the simple fact that it continues bears witness, among other examples of resilience, to what will surely be remembered as one of the most dignified episodes in the history of cities: Manhattan's survival. \u00b7 The Newsroom, Guardian Newspapers' new archive and visitor centre, will be hosting Here Is New York, an exhibition of photographs documenting the aftermath of September 11, from September 11 until October 5.
