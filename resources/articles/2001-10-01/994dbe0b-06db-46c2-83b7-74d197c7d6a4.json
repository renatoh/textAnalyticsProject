The interior of the Barbican Hall has been altered over the summer, with one of the aims being to improve acoustics. In this respect it seems to have been very successful. With the adjustable panels in the ceiling set to suit a full orchestra, the LSO's sound, fuelled by Colin Davis's energetic conducting, was more vibrant than ever; the noise seems to come straight at you and to blossom in the air around your ears. Details that might not have attracted attention before now cut clearly through the texture - the occasional zing of a harp, the swish of a quiet cymbal clash. With the brass sounding bright and loud, there will be no danger of anyone in the audience being allowed to drift off. In any case, inattention was not an option during Mitsuko Uchida's performance of Mozart's Piano Concerto No 21. Uchida's endless phrases seemed to grow organically from the sound around her, complementing it perfectly. Rather than being set apart as a soloist, she was an integral, albeit favoured, member of the orchestra. The mischievous beginning of the concerto, an almost comic creeping-up-from-behind theme, was recalled only half playfully in her entrancing cadenza, a journey through an enormous range of expression. In the second movement she moved effortlessly in and out of the atmospheric orchestral texture, with the bassoon in particular providing fluid, sustained support. The new acoustic seems to benefit the higher frequencies most, and the violins and flute sounded especially radiant. This season the LSO will be performing all three symphonies by Elgar, one of its former principal conductors. In front of his own orchestra, Davis was on thrilling form. The breadth of tone the orchestra could achieve was revealed even in the repeat of the opening theme, and every pause was pregnant with anticipation. Davis encouraged the strings to play with bristling fury in the second movement, drew out a burgeoning intensity in the third, and physically flung down the accents in the finale. The orchestra is recording these Elgar concerts for release on its own LSO Live label. On the strength of this performance, those discs should be quite special."}, "isHosted": false}}}
