Feinberg had asked Conway which countries Trump was referring to when he tweeted that four Democratic lawmakers \u2013 representatives Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota \u2013 should \u201cgo back\u201d to where they \u201ccame from\u201d. The president\u2019s remarks have widely been condemned as racist and on Tuesday drew a formal rebuke from the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. All four members of Congress targeted by Trump are US citizens. Addressing reporters at the White House, Conway grew testy while fielding questions on Trump\u2019s motivations in singling out four women of color. When asked by Feinberg why his own ethnicity was relevant to the discussion, Conway shot back: \u201cBecause I\u2019m asking you a question.\u201d She also offered that her ancestors were from Ireland and Italy, to which Feinberg replied: \u201cMy ethnicity is not relevant to the question I\u2019m asking you.\u201d Conway later wrote on Twitter that she meant \u201cno disrespect\u201d by asking about the reporter\u2019s ethnicity, in an attempt to spin Trump\u2019s comments as alluding to the idea that everyone has a heritage. \u201cWe are all from somewhere else \u2018originally\u2019. I asked the question to answer the question and volunteered my own ethnicity: Italian and Irish,\u201d Conway tweeted. \u201cLike many, I am proud of my ethnicity, love the USA &amp; grateful to God to be an American.\u201d Conway has forcefully defended Trump amid the controversy over his remarks, stating: \u201cA lot of us are sick and tired in this country of America coming last.\u201d Her husband, George Conway, meanwhile penned a column in the Washington Post titled: \u201cTrump is a racist president.\u201d George Conway, a conservative lawyer, is a prominent critic of Trump\u2019s who has repeatedly declared the president\u2019s actions as unconstitutional despite his wife\u2019s position in the West Wing. In his op-ed, George Conway recalled an incident from his childhood when his mother, who had immigrated to the US from the Philippines, was told: \u201cGo back to your country.\u201d \u201cNo matter how much I came to dislike him, I didn\u2019t want to think that the president of the United States is a racial bigot,\u201d George Conway added, \u201cBut Sunday left no doubt.\u201d \u201cNaivete, resentment and outright racism, roiled in a toxic mix, have given us a racist president.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
