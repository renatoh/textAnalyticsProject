It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken, which came out in 1996 having originally been published in Seth's comic series, Palookaville, follows the artist's search for an obscure (fictional) cartoonist named Kalo; Wimbledon Green (2005) tells the story of \"the world's greatest comic book collector\". Both are wonderfully good. Now, taking a break from his work as the designer of the 25-volume Complete Peanuts, he brings us George Sprott, an 81-year-old local TV personality who will shortly be shuffling off this mortal coil. Poor George. In his last hours, he is haunted by the ghosts of his ignominious past. Then again, his imminent departure is, perhaps, overdue. When we meet him, it is 1975. The heyday of local television is long past. People don't so much watch his rackety shows about Arctic exploration as endure them; hunkered down in his studio, George is known to slumber off during screenings of the films he made as a younger man, and his TV company, CKCK, will shortly be dumping all his old videotapes. Seth is not sentimental about his latest creation: Sprott is a monster of selfishness, fat and vain and lacking in self-awareness. Nevertheless, he diligently \"researches\" his life for us, obituary-style, using interviews with friends, relatives and one rare viewer (a bed-bound old lady) to pin him to the page. And in doing so he conjures an Ontario long disappeared. One of the joys of this book is that, in addition to the text, it contains photographs of Seth's homemade models of key buildings in Sprott's life: the Coronet Lecture Hall (now a discount computer outlet); the Radio hotel (now a Marriott); the Melody Grill (still open for business, but likely to be boarded up any day soon). It's as if Edward Hopper had set to work with scissors and glue. George Sprott began its life as a serial in the New York Times magazine and for this reason, each page is self-contained, like a single chapter. But this structure also works to suggest that Sprott is disappearing from the collective memory even of his own small town faster than the reader can turn the pages of his life story. Sure enough, in a delicious epilogue, we cut to 2009, where we visit Owen Trade, a collector of TV memorabilia. Trade owns all sorts of Sprott ephemera, including a black-and-white photograph of him, taken from the wall of the Melody Grill (yes, it did close). As collections go, however, Sprott stuff is not exactly sought after. \"I Googled George the other day,\" he says. \"I got only one hit.\" This is a beautiful joke: the internet, like TV before it, has all but forgotten our hero. Yet the book of his life that you hold in your hands is a small masterpiece. It is just so typical of Seth to take the trouble to care."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
