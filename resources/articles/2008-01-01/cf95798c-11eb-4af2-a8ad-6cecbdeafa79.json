While two bidders - Sir Richard Branson's Virgin and former Abbey boss Luqman Arnold's Olivant - look to finance an offer for Northern Rock, nationalisation of the bank remains an option amid fears that the credit crunch will claim another banking victim. Even with the fallout from 2007's sub-prime mortgage crisis, banks are expected to report record profits. But the numbers will be scrutinised for any black holes. As 2007 ended, nervousness was reflected in banks' refusal to lend to each other, as seen in the high level of the Libor interest rate. Some bankers believe it may be September before this improves. If so, mortgage rates are likely to rise and bank shares slide. Industry and mining A motor industry executive recently said the issues facing the industry were: \"Green, green and green.\" Brussels is forcing through big cuts in C02 exhaust emissions with the threat of hefty fines. Any firm offering low-emission and low-consumption models will also have a competitive advantage. Manufacturing is also focusing hard on environmental issues. In November a CBI report by business leaders warned that Britain had to act quickly to cut the UK's own emissions of greenhouse gases but also to ensure Britain got its share of business in a low-carbon economy. Manufacturing must also grapple with high energy prices, a weak dollar against sterling, and the uncertainties generated by the credit crunch, which could damage confidence. Cost will be a major issue in mining as labour and equipment charges rise, yet commodity prices could weaken, hitting margins. The weak dollar will have an impact as costs are in other currencies but profits are reported in dollars. Consolidation will feature: BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto might finally get together; Xstrata could be taken over by Anglo American or Brazil's Vale. Mergers and takeovers will increase as smaller firms struggle to raise cash due to the credit crunch. Demand in China and India is likely to prop up commodity prices. Energy As oil jumped half a dollar to $96.45 a barrel yesterday after a year of similar spikes, 2008 may be the year when it breaks through the $100 mark. Surging demand from China and India has kept up the physical side of the market, while scares have done the rest, whether that be fear of export shortages from Iraq or the threat of a US attack on Iran. Crude rose 57% in 2007 but some was due to the fall in the dollar. In euro terms, the oil price rose barely 40% over the year. Few would rule out a further slump in the greenback, or conflict in the Middle East or in key suppliers such as Nigeria. The demand side depends on wider forces, such as whether the credit crunch will deepen and push the US into recession, plus whether China and India can keep up their storming growth. It is likely to be another year of recovery for nuclear power with the British government poised to give the green light to new atomic plants. It will also be another good year for UK renewables with a number of new wind-power projects coming on stream. Retail and leisure Most retailers expect spending to slow. The B&amp;Q group Kingfisher, Dixons' and Curry's owner DSG, and the fashion chain Next have warned of falling confidence. The credit squeeze, rising council taxes, utility bills, food prices and mortgage repayments will cut spending even if interest rates fall further. A sustained property downturn will be bad news for retailers selling homewares and home improvements. Broker Kaupthing says: \"This is the start, not the end, of a slowdown in retail spending.\" Some retail executives may have a tough year. The billionaire Mike Ashley reckons he is now building bridges with investors but has a huge task to rebuild trust and Sports Direct is still one of the UK's most unpleasant places to shop. Debenhams' Rob Templeman and Trevor Bish-Jones of Woolworths face an uphill task. The latter, analysts say, makes all the right management moves but still ends up a loser because Woolworths, as a retail concept, is past its sell-by date. Last year's mild winter was blamed for unsold stock but sales might get a boost as a cold January is forecast. Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the last big UK brewer, has rebuffed two break-up proposals from unwanted predators Carlsberg and Heineken. They have until January 21 to make a firm offer. The gem in S&amp;N is its 50% share of BBH, a fast-growing eastern European brewer that is a market leader in Russia with Baltika, left. The twist is that S&amp;N's partner at BBH is Carlsberg. S&amp;N says its actions have put the BBH partnership beyond repair and a divorce at BBH is likely. Technology and Media Convergence - of media, technology and telecoms - is the buzzword after the first converged device, the iPhone, showed that mixing media with internet access, voice calls and texting can work. We should see similar touch-screen phones this year as the internet finally goes mobile. Google is expected to make more noise this year about its mobile handset alliance and Android suite of mobile technology, which it hopes will open up the mobile web to developers in the same way that the web has opened up to everyone. Nokia's Ovi mobile content platform has attracted Vodafone's interest and the launch of its all-you-can-eat music service later this year will be keenly watched by a music industry worried about iTunes' dominance. In social networking, Facebook may face the backlash that greeted MySpace last year and so the text-message micro-blogging site Twitter, the community-based online news site Digg and LinkedIn, a social networking site for professionals, have all been touted as potential buyout targets for 2008. More broadband operators will provide TV over phone lines, with Orange due to launch its IPTV soon. Mobile phone companies will also push new \"femtocell\" technology- a low-power mobile phone base station in your house that increases in-home mobile phone coverage and allows free calls from a mobile handset over broadband. The telecoms and media regulator Ofcom will continue reviewing the pay-TV market and will launch an inquiry into the mobile phone industry. The cost of calls should fall if the regulator finally gets to grips with the complex world of mobile termination rates. Pharmaceuticals Big Pharma faces another turbulent year of patent expiries, slowing sales growth and fewer approvals. Revenues will be affected by product withdrawals or safety scares from 2007. Switzerland's Novartis will be hit by the suspension in the US of its irritable bowel syndrome drug Zelnorm. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) will suffer lower sales of its diabetes drug Avandia after May's safety scare. Safety will be a key issue as the US food and drug administration focuses on the risks of drugs. Last year saw fewer approvals in the US, and this is likely to continue. Fewer potential blockbuster drugs are expected and approvals of new chemical entities may be concentrated in specialist areas such as oncology. Firms will continue to cut costs, which could mean more job losses. There is still a danger that avian flu, above, may become a pandemic. This would benefit firms such as GSK and Sanofi Aventis, which have vaccines. Another factor will be the US presidential election as issues such as pricing and therapeutic substitution, where a pharmacist gives a different chemical entity from the same class of prescribed drug, come to the fore. Transport British Airways and Heathrow's owner BAA - criticised for poor standards and their role in global warming last year - will be hoping that problems with lost bags and security queues do not continue at Heathrow's new Terminal 5. Three days after the terminal opens on March 27, transatlantic air travel will be liberalised when the Open Skies agreement comes into force. The lucrative route between Heathrow and New York-JFK will be opened up to newcomers, presenting BA and Virgin Atlantic with a new set of challenges. BAA faces a tough year as it prepares for a ruling from the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, on landing fees at its airports. It has been warned to expect an annual profits shortfall of about \u00a3150m under the new regime, which will affect refinancing its \u00a39.3bn debt burden. BAA has also warned that a new third runway at Heathrow, which could get the go-ahead by mid-2008, could be at risk from the CAA's pricing proposals. The oil price pushed the business-class airline MAXjet into bankruptcy last week and it will be a major concern for all transport companies in 2008. Airline costs will come under pressure and the industry's global profit margin of just 1.1% will be squeezed. Bus and rail firms such as FirstGroup and Stagecoach also face higher fuel costs but their main concern will be the economy and how it affects demand. Both have agreed to pay the government at least \u00a31bn over the course of their First Great Western and South West Trains franchises, which rely on commuters for much of their revenues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
