In a sign of the tough new regime at Conservative central office, the co-chairman, Liam Fox, has launched an \"audit\" of candidates in marginal seats. Under the terms of the audit, which is described by senior Tories as \"firm but benevolent\", candidates in marginal seats have been ordered to submit a weekly email to central office outlining their plans. Dr Fox wants to see each candidate's diary, outlining every visit they plan to make and a copy of every press release and speech. If candidates are seen as failing to pull their weight, or concentrating on areas deemed irrelevant by central office, they will face pressure through their constituency. Dr Fox introduced the audit after being advised by John Howard, the Australian prime minister, that strong candidates in marginal seats are an opposition's most important weapon in a general election. Mr Howard will abandon the Tory leader's traditional tour of safe seats in the run-up to the general election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
