This reports that universities in England increased their surplus on their teaching activities from \u00a3178m in 2007-08 to \u00a3269m. In contrast, their losses on research activity grew from \u00a31,699m to \u00a31,848m. Does anything better illustrate the bogus nature of the Russell Group and government discourse on university funding and their concentration on tuition fees and student finance (Editorial, 12 July)? Martin Quinn Tavistock, Devon \u2022 \u00a36,000 for an A-level student (Letters, 12 July)? In further education colleges we get about \u00a34,000, a quarter of the cost of a place at Oxford. Chris Faux London \u2022 Can we not take the Gove out of government? George McLean Manchester \u2022 I liked the photograph of the Archbishop of Canterbury on the front page (13 July). He was proudly displaying his beard and sandals. So why, I wonder, did he feel the need to conceal his copy of the Guardian in a black folder? Dr Paul Cassidy Huddersfield \u2022 Victor Hugo complained that London had too many statues of various King Georges (Comment, 12 July). I've noticed that every town or city in France seems to have a Rue Victor Hugo. John Shirley London \u2022 According to your World Cup 2010 guide, \"Capello will not settle for second best from his players in South Africa\"; \"five of the World Cup's best players\" include Rooney, Torres, Messi and Kaka; and \"the Dutch would rather try to win with elan than do so ugly\". Perhaps you should commission Paul the octopus to write your guide for Brazil 2014. Barry James Manchester \u2022 Surely we shouldn't be surprised at the antics of the Dutch \u2013 they've always been a nation of cloggers.
