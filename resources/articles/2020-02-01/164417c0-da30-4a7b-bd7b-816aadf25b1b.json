In handing down the sentence, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the US district court for the District of Columbia lambasted Stone, 67, calling his attempts to thwart a congressional inquiry of \u201cgreat national significance\u201d a \u201cthreat to our most fundamental institutions, to the very foundation of our democracy\u201d. But she sentenced Stone to 40 months in prison, far less than the punishment prosecutors originally sought. Stone was convicted in November on seven felony charges, including lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia in the 2016 presidential election. Stone had denied wrongdoing. Jackson argued Stone\u2019s disregard for the truth should worry all those who care about American democracy and accused him of covering up for Trump. \u201cThe dismay and disgust at the defendant\u2019s belligerence should transcend party,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe truth still exists,\u201d she said. \u201cThe truth still matters.\u201d After the sentencing, a spokeswoman for Stone appealed directly to Trump for a pardon. \u201cIt falls on President Trump to use the power of a pardon as the final means of checks and balances to right this horrible wrong,\u201d Kristin Davis said in a statement. Trump, who issued 11 high-profile pardons earlier this week, said he was holding off for now. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything in terms of the great powers bestowed upon a president of the United States,\u201d Trump said during an appearance in Las Vegas. \u201cI want the process to play out. I think that\u2019s the best thing to do because I would love to see Roger exonerated.\u201d Adam Schiff, a high-profile California Democrat who chairs the House intelligence committee, said to pardon Stone when his crimes were committed to protect Trump would be a \u201cbreathtaking act of corruption\u201d. Stone wore a bemused look for much of the nearly three-hour hearing on Thursday, standing with his defense team to receive his sentence. A small group of male supporters with mostly trendy haircuts, designer bags and Make America Great Again embellishments watched the proceedings from an overflow room next to where Stone was being sentenced. At one point, security removed one of the men after he began protesting against Jackson\u2019s remarks. \u201cRidiculous. This is a sham,\u201d he cried as he was escorted out of the room. Outside the courtroom, rightwing activists chanted \u201cPardon Roger Stone\u201d while opponents shouted:\u201cLock him up.\u201d The sentencing went ahead despite an 11th-hour request by Stone\u2019s defense team for a new trial. Jackson has not yet ruled definitively on that motion, but she determined that postponing the sentencing would not be \u201ca prudent thing to do given all the circumstances\u201d. Stone will not have to report to prison until the court rules on that motion, which is based on a claim of juror bias. Stone, a flamboyant Republican operative who began his political career as a junior staffer on Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election campaign in 1972, had become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for supporters of the president, who said he was being punished for defending his longtime friend. Jackson forcefully rejected such claims, stating that Stone was not being prosecuted \u201cfor standing up for the president\u201d but for \u201ccovering up for the president\u201d. Stone\u2019s sentencing hearing followed an extraordinary series of events in which justice department officials overruled a sentencing recommendation by the prosecutors of between seven and nine years in federal prison, a punishment Trump assailed on Twitter as \u201chorrible and very unfair\u201d. After the president condemned the prosecutors directly and decried a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d, the attorney general, William Barr, intervened and sought a more lenient punishment. His intervention prompted the entire prosecution team to resign in protest, including one member who left the justice department altogether. Barr \u2013 a close ally of the president \u2013 also publicly reproached Trump, saying the president\u2019s online commentary about politically sensitive investigations made it \u201cimpossible\u201d for him to do his job. Trump eventually said on Twitter that he had not asked the attorney general to \u201cdo anything in a criminal case\u201d, but argued that, as president, he had \u201cthe legal right to do so\u201d and had \u201cso far chosen not to!\u201d Despite Barr\u2019s rebuke, Trump continued to weigh in on the case on Twitter. On Tuesday, he quoted the Fox News analyst Andrew Napolitano who claimed that the jury harbored biases against the president and that \u201calmost any judge in the country\u201d would throw out the conviction. \u201cEverything having to do with this fraudulent investigation is badly tainted and, in my opinion, should be thrown out,\u201d Trump wrote in another tweet. On Thursday, Jackson asked the new prosecution team to explain its position, noting that the justice department had not actually withdrawn its initial sentencing recommendation of seven to nine years in prison. \u201cI fear that you know less about the case than just about everybody else in the courtroom,\u201d Jackson told John Crabb, the prosecutor newly assigned to the case. Crabb apologized for the \u201cconfusion\u201d surrounding the sentencing recommendation and defended the initial trial team, who he said had received approval to submit the initial sentencing memo. \u201cThis prosecution was, and this prosecution is, righteous,\u201d Crabb said. Asked by Jackson whether he had written the court filing that reversed the original sentencing recommendation, Crabb declined to say. Jackson told the court that she believed the original recommendation was well-researched but unnecessarily punitive, a conclusion she said she reached notwithstanding the \u201cunprecedented actions of the Department of Justice in the past week\u201d. Stone\u2019s attorney, Seth Ginsberg, asked Jackson to consider the man and not the \u201clarger-than-life\u201d public persona his client had cultivated over the course of decades. Stone, Ginsberg argued, is a faithful family man with no criminal record whose political activism includes support for football players who suffered concussions and animal rights groups. \u201cMr Stone is, in fact, not simply that public persona, but a human being,\u201d Ginsberg said. Since Trump was acquitted by the Senate of charges that he abused power and obstructed Congress, he has embarked on a campaign of retribution against his perceived political enemies while intervening to protect allies who have been loyal. His defense of Stone came just days after the conclusion of the Senate impeachment trial. Trump has not ruled out pardoning his longtime friend. On Thursday he appeared to raise that possibility again. The president tweeted out a clip of the Fox News host Tucker Carlson saying Stone should be pardoned and also pinned it to the top of his feed. Stone\u2019s convictions stem from the former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. During the course of the week-long trial, the jury heard from Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, that Stone was the campaign\u2019s \u201caccess point\u201d to WikiLeaks, which published a trove of stolen Democratic emails in the final weeks of the last presidential campaign.
