I'm not the greatest fan of New Labour, but then I look at the faults in the rest of the parties. I can't imagine William Hague being a prime minister. Labour has done well with the minimum wage. That was certainly a move forward after Gordon Brown getting it wrong with the 75p pension issue. I've got a lot of time for him. He can be a stingy bugger sometimes but he's smart and balances that with a social conscience. All l've seen the parties talking about so far is health, education, and law and order. I want a good education for my grandchildren and I want good health services, but they keep missing the issue of jobs. I am ultra-sensitive about jobs. It is an issue in Scotland. It's a cultural thing. People working means so much to a community. I'm a bit unhappy about the way Labour goes about things. But if I'm critical of Labour it is because I am impatient. I had high expectations of them, and so far I would give them a pass. Scotland will be one of the most interesting campaigns and I'm looking forward to the election. We've got four weeks to go and if there is a major spanner in the works, it's how fickle people can be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
