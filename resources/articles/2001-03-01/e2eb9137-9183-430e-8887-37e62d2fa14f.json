It is more likely that he was using the word \"foreigner\" in its accepted English football sense, that is to say \"somebody who doesn't come from the British Isles\". This semantic quirk may explain why the Uefa chief executive Gerhard Aigner's remarks on the need for urgent action to limit the influx of foreign players has been seized on in some quarters with a kind of unrestrained glee normally encountered in football only when a player has to change his shorts on the pitch. Doubtless buoyed by having organised a new transfer system that calls to mind Lord Palmerston's words on the Schleswig-Holstein Question, \"Only three men ever understood it fully and one of them has since gone mad\", an excited Aigner told the Observer: \"If we have three English teams in the Uefa Cup, they should be three English teams rather than an international select team.\" I am not sure this is quite the good news for our game some people appear to think it is. Uefa's interpretation of what foreign means is different from that of most British people. As far as Uefa is concerned, Great Britain does not exist; it is four separate football nations. When Aigner says English, I'm sure he means English. We have seen the effect this interpretation has on our clubs before. When, in the 1990s, the rules of European competitions limited the number of foreign players a side could field, nobody in English football seemed too pleased about it. Indeed, many of the same people who are now quick to support the Uefa chief executive's comments moaned then that it was unfair to English teams because Ryan Giggs, Mark Hughes, Brian McClair, Denis Irwin and Roy Keane were foreign only technically speaking. The fact is that the most successful English club sides have rarely been exclusively or even predominantly staffed by Englishmen. When Liverpool beat Roma in the 1984 European Cup final, for example, seven of the starting line-up and both the substitutes they used played football for countries other than England. Did Liverpool fans think that this was, in Aigner's words, \"against the spirit in sport\"? I doubt it. Likewise, while in England nowadays the complaint is that the number of foreign players in the Premiership is weakening the national team, I do not recall anyone in the 1970s muttering that Leeds United's great midfield of Billy Bremner, John Giles, Peter Lorimer and Eddie Gray was causing selection headaches for Sir Alf Ramsey. To Uefa it may seem plain that three Scots and an Irishman were keeping a quartet of plucky English lads from learning their trade as surely as two Frenchmen, a Dane and a Swede, but sometimes tradition overrides logic. The major problem that afflicts English football is not that we import too much but that we barely export anything at all. No other country that aspires to anything like top-class status has so few of its nationals plying their trade abroad as we do. A check through the estimable European Football Yearbook shows that last season in the top divisions across the continent, England was represented by three players in Belgium, three in Finland, a couple in the Netherlands, a trio in Malta, one each in Sweden and Israel and the enterprising duo of Chris Knight and Joseph Paris in the Faroe Islands. And then, of course, there was Steve McManaman. Compared to us even those other traditional stop-at-homes, the Spanish, look like an Australian with an Inter-rail card. If our national balance of payments deficit mirrored that of football, Gordon Brown would have locked himself in his office with a revolver long ago. Instead of hoping that Gerhard Aigner will stop overseas players coming in to England, we should be petitioning him to get English players to move abroad. Zinedine Zidane, who should know about such things, has said that Serie A is the best schooling a player can have. Surely it is time more of our footballers benefited from such an education?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
