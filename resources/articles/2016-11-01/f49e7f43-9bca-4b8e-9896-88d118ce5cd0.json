There may still be an asterisk aside certain qualification for the Four Nations final, but only a mathematical miracle will now prevent the Kangaroos from making it to Anfield later this month after victory of a very different kind in week two of the tournament. Had New Zealand beaten the Kangaroos, it would have created a winner-takes-all scenario in London next week between England and Australia for a place in the final alongside the Kiwis. David Kidwell\u2019s side certainly put up a real fight and a narrow defeat helps their case for qualification if it boils down to points difference \u2013 but in the end, as has been customary over the years, Australia simply found a way to win. Much like last week against Scotland in Hull, the Kangaroos were near-faultless in the opening quarter \u2013 and that was the backbone for their victory. After 13 minutes they had surged into a 10-0 lead with two tries of the highest quality to Blake Ferguson and Johnathan Thurston. The Kiwis did manage to stem the flurry of Australian points for the remainder of the half, however, but it was not until the second half when they were able to test the Kangaroos\u2019 line properly themselves. The Kiwis were shorn of possession throughout the first 40 minutes but after a penalty sprung them into Australian territory, their resolve earned them a reward when Solomone Kata barged over. From there, New Zealand were suddenly on top and the side hunting points \u2013 but two penalties from the boot of Thurston settled the Kangaroos\u2019 nerves soon after. New Zealand, however, set up a grandstand finish when Shaun Johnson produced a wonderful piece of individual magic, laying the platform for Jordan Rapana to touch down \u2013 and Johnson almost did something even more extraordinary on the hooter when he danced through the Kangaroos\u2019 line. But the mercurial Kiwis\u2019 scrum-half could not ground the ball, meaning his side fell desperately short. It means that should they win by less than 30 points against Scotland on Friday, England know they merely have to beat Australia without points difference coming into play. That, however, is a far more daunting task than it sounds \u2013 and the Aussies are far more certain of their destiny.
