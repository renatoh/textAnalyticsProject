Robbie Blake's 19th-minute volley gave Burnley a remarkable victory in the first top-flight match at Turf Moor for 33 years and Ferguson admitted it had been \"a bad performance\" from the champions. Michael Owen, in particular, had a traumatic evening in front of the England manager Fabio Capello, but Ferguson felt that all his players should take the blame after a performance that will have exacerbated the sense that United without Cristiano Ronaldo are no longer such formidable opponents. \"I'm sure we'll get a response [at Wigan] on Saturday, but we're all disappointed because it was a bad result,\" Ferguson said. \"It was a terrific pitch so that's no excuse. We just should have done better with it. We didn't play well but that can happen. We usually take time to get going every season \u2013 sometimes it's October before we get to our best form \u2013 but, yes, we shouldn't be losing these games.\" Ferguson identified the key moment being in the 43rd minute when Brian Jensen, the Burnley goalkeeper, saved Michael Carrick's penalty. Jensen spoke of it being \"a dream come true\" but admitted he had been \"surprised\" Carrick had been assigned to taking over from Ronaldo as United's penalty-taker when \"there was Wayne Rooney or Michael Owen\". Ferguson may now review the decision. \"I think we'd have won the game if we'd scored that,\" he said. \"We'd have composed ourselves and won, I think. Instead, in the second half we got harried with our passes and made a couple of bad decisions. That can happen. We should have done more with the chances we had and the possession we had. But in fairness to Burnley they had a good spell too and caused us a lot of problems.\" Burnley had been widely tipped to go straight back down to the Championship and Coyle could not resist having a dig at some of the club's detractors as he reflected on a night when he admitted not being able to hear the referee's whistle because of the din created by the crowd. \"I'm sure a lot of people thought we would already be bottom of the league with zero points, so it's nice to disprove those people. The key now is to keep disproving them,\" he said. \"Before the game I was quite positive about getting a result. But then it flashed up on television that in Manchester United's last 17 games against promoted clubs they had won 17, scoring 44 with only seven against. I wished I had turned it off, but I didn't let the players see and they were magnificent. If you look at the money the clubs have spent, this was a mismatch really, but we stood up to them, we were brave and we caused them a lot of problems as well. What we have is an unbelievable work ethic.\" They also have a set of supporters who will make Turf Moor a hostile place for every visiting side this season. \"At times this place gets a bad reputation,\" Coyle said. \"People call us ramshackle but I'm from the old school and I love this kind of old stadium. The whole place was absolutely rocking.\" Ferguson added: \"You wonder if it's fate \u2013 Burnley back in the Premier League. It's been a long time and you can't deny them their victory. They worked hard, they worked their socks off, and their fans were fantastic. They got behind them all night. It was fantastic for them on their return to the Premier League, playing United. It was a great occasion for them.\" The United manager hailed Blake's winning volley as a \"marvellous strike\" but he was less impressed with his own side and there were strong words in the away dressing room after the final whistle. \"We didn't defend well,\" Ferguson said, though his main ire was reserved for the team's attackers. \"A couple of times we took touches when we should have shot quickly. We had opportunities. \"It's not a concern at this stage when you see the chances we've had. Two or three players had chances, Owen in the first half, [Ryan] Giggs in the second. Michael Carrick had the best chance and he lost the opportunity. Hopefully, we will get as many chances on Saturday.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
