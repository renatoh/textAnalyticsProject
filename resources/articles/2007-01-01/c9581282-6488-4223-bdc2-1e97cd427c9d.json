But it's strangely compelling. It's not so much that the fish feeds on the blood of other fish in the Amazon. (Unless you are an Amazonian fish, this doesn't matter.) Rather, it's the candiru's other claim to infamy: its penchant for lodging itself in the human urethra. Yes, it's that fish referenced by William Burroughs in Naked Lunch, trivia fiends. The stuff, in short, of nightmares. Midsomer Murders 8.30pm, ITV1 You know there's trouble ahead when the taxi driver remarks, \"He's worth a few bob then, your uncle.\" (Technically, of course, you know peril is imminent because you're in Midsomer Whatsit where homicidal maniacs in Barbour jackets lurk round every picturesque corner and the post office sells sawn-off shotguns.) And so it comes to pass: aforementioned uncle, who had told everyone you were dead, turns up toast himself. Idyllic, eh? American Idol 8.30pm, ITV2 Sitting between Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson while confronted with an apparently endless rote of the talentless and delusional clearly has some effect on one's personality if Paula Abdul's recent behaviour in an interview is anything to go by. (Search youtube for the clip and decide for yourself if she's intoxicated; she says she isn't.) Cat Deeley, now a lukewarm property in the US thanks to the success of the self-explanatory So You Think You Can Dance, which is on LivingTV here, presents this edited-for-Britain Idol. Killer Cloud - Timewatch 9pm, BBC2 Thanks to fortuitous geography and geology, we Brits are spared tsunamis and earthquakes. Not for us, natural disasters. (We prefer to create our own - such as climate change and Davina McCall's chat show.) But before you get comfortable in the severe gales, consider the summer of 1783, when a volcanic eruption in Iceland cast a deadly pall over the UK, killing thousands of Britons and heralding a cruel winter that claimed many more lives. It was one of the great natural disasters in European history. Bardot losing Eurovision doesn't count."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
