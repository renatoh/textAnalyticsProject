Can the public get enough of G\u00e9rard Depardieu's sexual organs? Well yes, probably, especially those on Flight AF5010 to Dublin, which was subsequently delayed for over an hour as Depardieu was evicted and his mess cleaned away.

The quote Sally Bercow \"I'm kind of going in because I want to stick two fingers up to the establishment.\" The speaker's wife sets out to undermine the System \u2013 by hanging out with Jedward, Kerry Katona and David Hasselhoff's ex in the Big Brother house. The tweet @LouiseMensch \"Of course Twitter was overall a massive force for good in the riots \u2026 \" tweeted Louise Mensch MP, from the account she uses hourly to engage in debate and news gathering. Odd, then, that she was among the most vocal of politicians calling for Twitter's temporary shutdown in times of crisis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
