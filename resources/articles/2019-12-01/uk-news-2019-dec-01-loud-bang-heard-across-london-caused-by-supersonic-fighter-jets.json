The Typhoons are returning to their base.\u201d Flight tracking sites showed that two Typhoons took off from RAF Coningsby around the time of the noise. A resident of Forest Gate, east London, told the Guardian he had already been awake and \u201cthought something had fallen down in our house,\u201d while similar experiences were recounted on social media, with posts about windows being rattled and car alarms set off. People living in Essex, west London and Stevenage were among those tweeting to say they had been woken by the noise, and Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue said it received a \u201clarge number\u201d of calls about the incident."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
