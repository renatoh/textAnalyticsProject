One is Imelda Staunton who, in the title role of Mike Leigh's Vera Drake , gives the performance of a lifetime. The other is Valeria Bruni Tedeschi in Fran\u00e7ois Ozon's 5X2 , which must be a favourite for the Golden Lion. Vera is a wonderful creation. As with the best characters in this great director's work, one can almost feel the hours that went into sculpting her. She is a postwar, working-class dynamo, bustling about east London, cleaning the houses of the well-to-do, visiting ailing friends in tenements, keeping her family's tiny flat spick and span and making cups of tea for what seems like the whole city. It is 1950, one of those periods that tends to fall down the back of history's sofa and be forgotten. London's working class is fragmenting into those who cling to pre-war austerity and those moving out to the suburbs. Staunton packs all this information, history and baggage into Vera. The film sets itself up so well that when the mood shifts dramatically, it does lose some of its momentum, but you follow Vera to the end because Staunton is so entirely convincing. In 5X2 , Valeria Bruni Tedeschi finally shows the form to lift her into the top ranks of European performers. The Italian-born actress excels in a beautifully filmed chamber piece about the breakdown of a relationship, told in reverse. We start in the divorce court and journey backwards through five scenes to a marriage. The opening few days were dominated by Hollywood. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg boated in to present The Terminal . Scarlett Johansson, sitting on the jury, presented her film, A Love Song for Bobby Long , in which she plays southern trailer trash who inherits a house in New Orleans but has to live with its alcoholic, poetry-spouting, tramp-like, ex-literature professor occupant, John Travolta. He is hopelessly miscast and ruins the film. Hollywood's better side was represented by Jonathan Demme's remake of The Manchurian Candidate . He recaptures the spirit of paranoid Seventies Hollywood thrillers and neatly satirises the bombast of politics in the modern media. I loved the careful casting, which has small parts for such familiar character actors as Dean Stockwell, John Bedford Lloyd and Charles Napier. But giving Venice one enormous injection of adrenaline was Michael Mann's Collateral . Tom Cruise plays a smooth, violent hitman with a contract to top five people in one night. He hijacks Jamie Foxx's cabby to drive him round LA. As he plays out-and-out nasty, it's the first time that I've really liked Cruise, but it's certainly not the first time that I've come out a Mann movie thinking it's the best thing ever. Tarantino's all at sea Never a dull moment when Quentin Tarantino is around. Having chaired the Cannes jury - and chosen Farenheit 9/11 - the director is in Venice to present the series of late-night screenings of Italian B movies. I bumped into him in angry mood, waving a few female autograph hunters away. 'I just got up, man. I'm here all week, all right? This isn't the time,' he said. It was noon. I understand he's keeping himself to himself, which is probably a good thing. The combative director is now getting frosty with John Travolta, his Pulp Fiction star. The pair previously discussed a prequel to the film, focusing on the life of Travolta's character, Vincent Vega, but nothing happened. 'It remains an idea and hasn't got further than that,' said Travolta. 'Quentin's unpredictable and you never know what he's going to do or how long it will take.' The pair found themselves in the same boat (sponsored by Missoni) on their way to the Lido the other night, but spies tell me they hardly spoke a word to each other. 'To be honest,' said my man in the deck shoes, 'Quentin looked a little queasy. He doesn't like the water that much and gripped the sides very firmly.' Grounded and grumpy Trash missed the opening-night party starring Spike Lee, Scarlett Johansson, John Travolta and Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, the latter pair who were here presenting The Terminal . Guess why I missed it? I was stuck at an airport, having arrived two minutes outside the brutal Ryanair cut-off period. After a bit of fuming and a warning from police for 'swearing in the proximity of children', I went for a spot of 'method criticism'. Hanks's Victor Navorski lives at JFK for months but there isn't much you can do in six hours at Stansted. An hour supping vile-tasting Guinness in O'Neill's, an hour choosing a crap book you won't read to make up the three-for-two deal, an hour trying on every single Swatch and you're done. Nobody speaks to you, the staff are miserable and it smells.From this, I can scientifically deduce that The Terminal is rubbish and that method criticism is the way forward. Next week, I shall be escaping from Belmarsh before assessing The Shawshank Redemption rerelease. Ciao. To the manner prawn Meryl Streep, in town to promote The Manchurian Candidate , in which she plays a scheming senator, snubbed the usual Venice celebrity stop-off at Harry's Bar. Instead, the grande dame gave orders to be taken to her favourite fish restaurant, Vecio Bragosso. It being four in the afternoon, she found it closed but after spotting Meryl knocking at the window, the owner opened up just for her. Apparently, Meryl just loves the local speciality called canoce, a large prawn, and would not leave until she'd sampled it. White wine and kisses flowed all afternoon, I'm told."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
