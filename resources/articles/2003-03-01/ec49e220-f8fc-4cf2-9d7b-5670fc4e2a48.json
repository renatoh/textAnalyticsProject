Bellamy concedes a throw deep in Barcelona territory. Reiziger takes. 2 mins: Lest there be any doubt about it later, hear me now: Newcastle must win this match and hope Bayer Leverkusen don't lose against Inter Milan. Bellamy steers the first opportunity of the night wide after being put through one-on-one with Valdez by Jenas. A great opportunity wasted. 4 mins: Bellamy skins DeBoer and shoots horribly high and wide from the exact same spot, just to the right of the Barcelona six-yard box. Another bad miss, but Newcastle are really taking the game to Barcelona early doors. 6 mins: Rochemback trips Bellamy out on the left wing. Robert whips in the resulting free-kick and Titus Bramble, of all people, almost heads it out of Valdez's hands and into the net. Moments later, Bellamy has a good shout for a penalty turned down and wins a free-kick this far outside the Barcelona box. 8 mins: Shearer wellies the free-kick into the wall, but Xavi is booked for encroaching. Personally, I'd have said that getting hit by that Scud missile of a free-kick was punishment enough. Shearer has another go and flattens another poor sod in the Barcelona wall. The ball pings around the box a bit before Newcastle are penalised for having a player offside. 11 mins: Newcastle win a free-kick on the half-way line after Rochemback handles. From the free-kick, Jenas breaks and lays it into the box for Bellamy, who clatters into DeBoer and falls over. The crowd appeal for a penalty but none is forthcoming. 12 mins: Reiziger hoists a long throw into the Newcastle box. O'Brien heads clear under pressure from Kluivert. 14 mins: Dyer fouls Mendieta about 15 feet outside the Newcastle box. Free-kick for Barcelona. Rochemback doesn't get a hold of his free-kick at all, but it still sneaks under the Newcastle wall and very narrowly wide of Shay Given's right-hand post. 17 mins: Rochemback outruns Olivier Bernard as they both chase a through ball into the Newcastle box. Given sprints from his goal and the Barcelona man lifts the ball over the bar. 18 mins: Shearer squares the ball for Bellamy after a great pass by Dyer. From about four yards, the Newcastle striker skews his effort against the base of the post. So close! 21 mins: It's still goalless here, and in the match between Inter and Bayer Leverkusen. 22 mins: Bellamy is having a shocker as far as his final ball is concerned. After turning brilliantly and leaving a Barcelona defender (didn't catch which one he went past him so fast) in his wake, he then undoes all his good work by slicing his attempted cross into the stand. Awful. 25 mins: My apologies, by the way, for the lack of (attempts at) humour in tonight's report. After four days in Ireland, I'm feeling anything but funny today. Drink is a terrible, terrible thing, and whoever invented it should be ashamed of themselves. 27 mins: Under pressure from Gabri, Bellamy fails to keep the ball in play over on the touchline. I'm not exaggerating whejn I say his touch is so poor tonight you'd think he was playing in a pair of big mad clown shoes. 29 mins: Griffin gives the ball away to Kluivert in the Newcastle box. He passes to the on-rushing Xavi, who is promptly harried off the ball by assorted Newcastle defenders. 31 mins: Robert sends a 40-yard free-kick (DeBoer fouled Shearer. Or didn't, as the case may be) fizzing narrowly wide of Valdez's right hand post. 33 mins: Not for the first or second time in the last half-hour, Bellamy shoots high and wide while bearing down on goal from the right-hand side of the penalty area. 34 mins: Robert pelts down the wing, taking a pass from Bellamy and crossing it to his captain, Alan Shearer. The ball goes past him and there's nobody following him to bury a big juicy scoring opportunity. 37 mins: Gabri and Kluivert combine beautifully to set up Riquelme, who Bellamies the ball over the bar. Terrible news for Newcastle fans: Inter are beating Bayer Leverkusen 1-0. If that score stays the same, the outcome of this match won't matter a jot to man or beast. 39 mins: My head hurts and my mouth feels like the dog slept in it. Riquelme tries to thread one through to Kluivert, but O'Brien intercepts and clears. Or was it Griffin? Or Bramable? More to the point, does it really matter? 41 minutes: And my flight was fog-bound for three hours this morning. Three hours! That's three extra, much-needed hours I could have spent in bed. Solano plays a smashing ball up the right wing to Dyer. He crosses and Bellamy arrvies a milli-second too late to force the perfect, knee-high cross home. If it's possible to play well and have a shocker at the same time, Bellamy is doing it. He's getting in the positions to miss, is what I'm trying to say in my own little addled way. 44 mins: Motta hoofs an effort into the stand. Very poor. It's nearly half-time, but Motta goes down holding his head. I know how he feels. He's okay. Lucky sod. Half-time entertainment: Gone fishing. Make your own fun. I'm too dishevelled. However, I have just seen Inter's goal about Leverkusen; talk about comical defending. Unbelievably bad. Inter have also missed a penalty, so things could be worse for Newcastle. 46 mins: Barcelona have replaced Xavi with Gerard. They get the second-half under way. \"Why aren't they showing the Newcastle match on TV?\" wonders Claire Haydon before engaging in a shameless but always welcome spot of brown-nosing. \"Not that I don't love reading your incisive yet comedy commentary, but I want to watch my boys at this crucial time! Surely more people would want to see Newcastle play Barca than watch the Bill (especially now that fit bloke isn't in it anymore)? This is madness. And it's not even on the ITV news channel like normal. For goodness' sake, anyone would think there's a war on.\" It's on Granada + Claire. And thank you for your kind words at this difficult time. That's what happens when your home town of Birr wins a record-breaking fourth All Ireland Club Hurling Championship on Saint Patrick's Day. You throw beer at it for three days and end up feeling like death on a stick. Lovely. 47 mins: the atmosphere is quite subdued, early in the second-half. Bramble hoiusts a great ball up to Robert on the left wing, deep in Barcelona territory. His attempt at a cross wins Newcastle a corner. Robert whips in the corner and Bramble brings a smart save out of Valdez with a - no messing - half-volleyed back-heel from 10 yards. Unbelievable from the big man who is named after a racehorse. Or has a racehorse named after him. And to think there are those who say he plays football like a racehorse too. 51 mins: Reiziger attempts to go round Griffin on a sortie into the Newcastle box. His attempt is unsuccessful and the defender rolls the ball back to his goalkeeper, who promptly hoofs the ball clear. 53 mins: Shearer is enalised for something or other. Offside, I think. Moments later, Robert's attempted cross to Bellamy is booted clear by Reiziger. 55 mins: Bernard sees yellow for a late tackle on Rochemback, who goes down in a heap like a man who's just been picked off by a sniper. Albeit a sniper armed with football boots instead of a rifle ... if you know what I mean. Listen to me - turning into Alan Partridge. Actually I'm not. He's funny. 57 mins: Robert goes down under a Gabri challenge in the box and begs the referee for a penalty. He doesn't get one. Barcelona counter and Mendieta squares the ball for Riquelme. The cross goes behind the on-rushing striker and a good chance goes a begging. 59 mins: GOAL! Newcastle 0 - 1 Barcelona Ah yes, that's the racehorse in him coming out now. Patrick Kluivert capitalises on a catastrophic Titus Bramble error. A mathematical equation to describe it best: two defenders + one collision + one headed back-pass that's way too feeble + one very fast Dutchman who can't believe his luck + one horror-stricken Irish goalkeeper = one football nestling in an empty goal. Newcastle are going out of the Champions League and that \"defending\" was staggeringly inept. 64 mins: Bellamy does brilliantly to beat two Barcelona defenders to a Shearer flick-on. His attempt to hook it over Valdez's head is too high. On any other night he'd be celebrating his fourth goal by now. Or sitting in the dressing room crying over the yellow card he'd just been shown. 65 mins: Robert crosses a free-kick from the left and Bellamy beats Andersson to get his head on the ball. His effort goes wide. Another bad miss from the Welshman. Too many substitutions at the same time: Iniesta for Mendieta on the Barcelona team. Ameobi and Viana for Solano and Robert on the Newcastle team. 68 mins: Newcastle win a free-kick on the left, which Viana lobs into the box. Barcelona clear. Kluivert is replaced by Sergio Garcia, who I always thought was a golfer. \"China is one of the first countries to have invented alcohol as a drink,\" writes Dominic Hart from La Paz in Bolivia, with regard to my current state of seediness, as grumbled about in the 25th minute. \"A large number of pottery wine vessels were discovered in Shangdong at the ruins of the Dawenkou culture which dates back 5,000 years. Recorded history tells about wine-making techniques of more than 4,000 years ago. So there you go - blame Dawenkou culture for your current woes. Unfortunately, I can't find any reference of whether or not they're ashamed of themselves.\" 72 mins: Bellamy misses another good chance - his sixth of the night. My Coventry City-supporting flatmate will be loving this. A card-carrying member of the Craig Bellamy fanclub he most certainly is not. 73 mins:GOAL!!! Newcastle 0 - 2 Barcelona The Catalan side win a free-kick on the left wing. St James's Park is reduced to stunned silence as Motta volleys the free-kick home at the near-post. A great goal greeted by complete silence. 75 mins: Newcastle need to score three goals and hope Bayer Leverkusen get at least one to have even a glimmer of hope of getting into the quarter-finals. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say it won't happen. After all, my anti-Nostradamus qualities can only help the Toon's cause. 77 mins: Sir Bobby Robson looks very sad. I don't know why - he's 40 years older than I am and considerably fitter. 79 mins: \"So, tell your worldwide audience about the Boys From Birr,\" writes Niall O'Keefe, with reference to the aforementioned best club hurling (fastest field-game in the world, men with sticks etc.) team in the world (and that's official). \"Great names you have down there: Pilkington and Glendenning. Sound like names of a bitter and a whiskey......DRINK!!!! Just what you need.\" Declan Pilkington had a great game, Mr O'Keefe - one of his best in a Birr shirt. The poor lad's been trying to retire for years and the club keep getting him to come back for more. Valdez clatters into his post and receives treatment. 83 mins: Two questions: (1) What does Kieron Dyer's mother put in his sandwiches?(2) Can I have some of it please? With Newcastle down and out, he's still running around like a three-year-old with very serious matters to attend to. Busy. Busy. Busy. 86 mins: Valdez makes a good, solid save from ... you've guessed it, Craig Bellamy. It's not happening for the lippy Welshman at all tonight - that was his 8th (count 'em) wide. If he had ducks they'd drown. 88 mins: Ronald DeBoer looks particularly cross about something, but I honestly couldn't tell you what. Shay Given sprints 40 yards out of his penalty area to make a clearance. He just about gets away with it. While we're on the subject of hurling, by the way, it's not widely known that the best goal Niall Quinn ever scored wasn't in a football match at all. Oh no. It was for Dublin Under-18s in a hurling match. Don't say you don't get a rounded education on this website. 92 mins: Shay Given makes an excellent save from Iniesta in a one-on-one, after Bernard had played the Barcelona substitute onside. Excellent stuff. Dyer runs a 100 yards with the ball on his toe, only to be bundled off it inside the Newcastle box. The referee blows for full time and the Newcastle players and Sir Bobby Robson walk off to an ovation from their fans. Sadly for them, however, they have been beaten by Barcelona and are out of the Champions League. Thanks for your many emails, most of which I couldn't use as the hectic pace of the game combined with my general sluggishness means I haven't got to read them yet. Meanwhile in Germany, you'll be interested to know, Inter have beaten Bayer Leverkusen 2-0. So, even if Newcastle had won tonight, they'd still have gone out.
