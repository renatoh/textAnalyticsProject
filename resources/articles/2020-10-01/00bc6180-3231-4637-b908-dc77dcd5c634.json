David Luiz was withdrawn during the defeat by Leicester on Sunday. It emerged he had sustained an injury to his left thigh and, whereas a club statement said his fitness for Sunday\u2019s visit to Manchester United would be assessed, Arteta appears resigned to losing him for a longer spell. It would continue Arsenal\u2019s run of misfortune in central defence, where they have eight potential starters but only Gabriel and Shkodran Mustafi available to face the League of Ireland champions. Rob Holding, Calum Chambers and Pablo Mar\u00ed are on the sidelines and Arteta said Mar\u00ed had experienced a slight setback in his recovery from an ankle ligament sprain. Sokratis Papastathopoulos and William Saliba were omitted from the Europa League squad, although the latter can play in the Premier League. Mustafi\u2019s appearance against Leicester, replacing David Luiz, was his first of the season after a hamstring injury but he will be pressed into action again four days on. \u201cMusti was carrying that injury from last season, with Calum it\u2019s the same situation, with Pablo he had surgery in his ankle and David rarely gets injured, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big thing but it\u2019s going to keep him out for a few weeks,\u201d Arteta said, going on to suggest Holding\u2019s hamstring injury was caused by the amount of football that had been pushed upon him by the shortage of available personnel. Arteta said Saliba was getting closer to first-team contention and that he felt \u201creally bad\u201d for denying him European action. \u201cHe\u2019s in a much better place,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s feeling a lot more confident around the place, his language is improving and he\u2019s starting to understand much better what we are doing physically.\u201d Victory over Dundalk at the Emirates would give Arsenal six points from their first two games after last Thursday\u2019s 2-1 win at Rapid Vienna."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
