Age: 18. Appearance: Hands in the air, white flag clutched in its fingers. What\u2019s happened? After a long and brave battle against apostrophe abuse and other common English usage errors, the APS has disbanded. Its a sad day for pedants everywhere. It\u2019s. And it is indeed. \u201cAt 96, I am cutting back on my commitments,\u201d said the APS chairman and driving force John Richards, a retired journalist from Boston, Lincolnshire. Fair enough. I am glad he has found peace at last. I don\u2019t think he has, to be honest. This is a victory for \u201cthe barbarians\u201d, he said. \u201c[We] have done our best, but the ignorance and laziness present in modern times have won!\u201d reads the APS website. Surely thing\u2019s aren\u2019t that bad? Things. Well, Richards became famous in 2001, when he began posting polite notices through the letterboxes of apostrophe abusers, \u201cdrawing your attention to an incorrect use which has been pointed out to us\u201d. I see you\u2019re using the passive-aggressive meaning of \u201cpolite\u201d there ... Then Richards formed the APS and people sent him examples from around the world, including monstrosities such as \u201calway\u2019s\u201d and \u201cprices\u2019s as marked\u201d. My eyes! There, there. He even had some success at his local library, which finally removed the apostrophe from its \u201cCD\u2019s\u201d sign. The pedants! United! Shall never be defeated! Yeah, except the APS was defeated many times. When? Waterstones dropped the apostrophe from its name in 2012. Mid Devon district council followed Birmingham\u2019s example by removing possessive apostrophes from its street signs in 2013. Richards called that \u201cappalling, disgusting and pointless\u201d. Its literally an assault on democracy or something. It\u2019s. And of course there are some longstanding but incorrect traditions, such as \u201cPythagoras\u2019 theorem\u201d and \u201cSt James\u2019 Park\u201d, the official name of Newcastle United\u2019s stadium. Whats wrong with those? What\u2019s. They should be \u201cPythagoras\u2019s\u201d and either \u201cSt James\u201d or \u201cSt James\u2019s\u201d. Eh? Look, the English language somehow uses the same letter \u2013 s \u2013 for both its possessive and plural inflections. We therefore end up with \u201cthe dogs bark\u201d and \u201cthe dog\u2019s bark\u201d, where the apostrophe denotes the missing letter e that was once part of the possessive \u201ces\u201d in Old English. Sorry, I nodded off there ... Although sometimes a word is both plural and possessive, or it already ends in an s. Then you have the \u201cthe dogs\u2019 bones\u201d or \u201cRichards\u2019s overreaction\u201d. Still, something like \u201cthe Joneses\u2019 car\u201d is basically impossible to say with a straight face. Its confusing, you\u2019re right. IT\u2019S CONFUSING. That apostrophe denotes a missing \u201ci\u201d for \u201cit is\u201d. It\u2019s simple, really. Do say: \u201cD\u2019oh!\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cThank heavens for McDonald\u2019s.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
