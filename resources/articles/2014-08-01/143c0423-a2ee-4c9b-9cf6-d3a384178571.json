Most UK businesses with a turnover of between \u00a325m and \u00a3750m are too conservative and reluctant to expand into fast-growing markets overseas, despite business confidence reaching a 22-year high, the report found. Almost three out of five firms said they do not currently export, and less than one in 10 is considering exporting within the next five years. This reluctance to sell abroad is a setback for the chancellor, George Osborne, who aims to double UK exports to \u00a31tn by 2020. He argues that rebalancing the economy away from consumer spending and towards manufacturing and exports will put the UK on a more sustainable path for the future. Commenting on the findings , the trade minister Lord Livingston said: \"Medium-sized businesses have the potential to be economic powerhouses for the UK economy, creating jobs and growth for all regions of the UK. This year I have written to every medium-sized firm in the UK to offer them tailored trade support from a dedicated advisor who can help companies start exporting for the first time or find brand new markets.\" Lord Livingston urged companies to contact the state body UK Trade and Investment - tasked with with helping UK-based exporters - for advice. However, 43% of exporting companies did not know about UKTI, which has been criticised by the cross-party public accounts committee over its effectivenees. However, 81% of those exporting companies that have used UKTI have said it was helpful. Companies were aware of the potential benefits of exporting, with 77% linking it to increased sales and profits. However, they also listed a lack of contacts, insufficient time and resources to research opportunities, and a lack of understanding of legal and regulatory requirements as barriers to exporting. Tim Hinton, managing director for SME and mid-markets banking at Lloyds Bank, said: \"Although business confidence has reached a record high, mid-sized firms often appear to be overlooking the benefits of exporting. Businesses are focusing their efforts on their UK operations first, looking to reduce their costs and increase productivity before embarking on global growth opportunities.\" Those mid-sized companies that do export were more focused on the UK's main trading partners in Europe and the US as opposed to emerging economies. When asked which countries they were targeting for expansion over the next decade, China was top, but Brazil was the only other emerging economy to make it into the top five, with the US, Germany and France taking the other slots. Hinton said: \"Although there is a great deal of interest in emerging economies, there is still a relatively low level of export activity to these regions. The picture is slowly changing, but too many UK firms appear to be prioritising markets closer to home over the long term.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
