The prime minister said Australia was talking to its friends and allies, including New Zealand, about \u201cwhat more we can do to help the Iraqi security forces\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll have more to say in the next day or so,\u201d Abbott said in Sydney on Wednesday. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, John Key, on Tuesday foreshadowed that Australia might send more troops to Iraq as part of a joint mission to fight extremist groups. Key told the New Zealand parliament his country was sending 143 troops to Iraq. \u201cThis is likely to be a joint training mission with Australia, although it won\u2019t be badged an Anzac force,\u201d Key said. The chief of the Australian defence force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, told a Senate committee on Wednesday morning that \u201cthe government of Australia is yet to make a final decision\u201d on sending more troops to Iraq. Abbott, who is due to visit New Zealand later this week, indicated an announcement was imminent. \u201cIt\u2019s well known for some time that we have been talking to our allies, we\u2019ve been talking to the Iraqis about what more we could do to assist the Iraqis to reclaim their own country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to Australia, America or any other outsider to reclaim Iraq for the Iraqis but it is important that the death cult be defeated and, as you know, Australia has been involved quite significantly for quite a few months now in the campaign to disrupt, degrade and ultimately destroy the Isil or Daesh death cult which has promoted this new dark age over so much of the Middle East.\u201d The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said earlier on Wednesday she would not \u201cpre-empt any statement by the prime minister or defence minister\u201d about the dispatch of additional Australian troops. \u201cWe\u2019ve already got 200 special forces in Iraq. New Zealand is now joining the coalition and we certainly welcome that,\u201d she said. \u201cOur efforts in Iraq are under constant review and discussion.\u201d Australian special forces troops were in Iraq to help train local forces, Bishop said. \u201cWe have about 400 personnel involved in the air strikes which are taking place to disrupt and deter Daesh, or Isil, in its advances. So we are already there with a significant presence. The composition of that presence is under constant review,\u201d Bishop said. Abbott is due to travel to New Zealand on Friday for the annual Australia-New Zealand leaders\u2019 meeting. \u201cI will discuss a range of bilateral and international issues, including combating terrorism, foreign fighters and the situation in Iraq,\u201d the prime minister said. On Saturday Abbott rubbished a \u201cfanciful\u201d story in the Weekend Australian that claimed he had suggested Australia should unilaterally send thousands of ground troops to Iraq. \u201cThe idea there was a meeting in late November where I formally asked for advice and formally suggested that a large Australian force should go unilaterally to Iraq is wrong, just wrong,\u201d he said. Binskin and the defence department secretary, Dennis Richardson, said on Monday in a statement: \u201cAt no point has the prime minister raised that idea with the ADF and/or the Department of Defence, formally or informally, directly or indirectly.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
