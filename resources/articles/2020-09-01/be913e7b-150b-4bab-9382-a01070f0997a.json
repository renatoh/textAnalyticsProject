Addressing \u201cConnected\u201d, an online event replacing Labour\u2019s annual conference, Dodds will highlight a \u201cfile of failure\u201d, as she seeks to underline the Tories\u2019 poor record. She will claim that Rishi Sunak\u2019s \u201cjob retention bonus,\u201d the \u00a31,000-a-head payout that firms will be able to claim in January for staff they have brought back from furlough and kept on the payroll, could mean \u00a32.6bn being paid to firms that would have retained staff anyway. And Dodds will also raise questions about a series of outsourcing contracts, including \u00a3133m paid to a consortium involving Randox, the testing firm that employs the former Tory minister Owen Paterson, and \u00a3150m for facemasks that weren\u2019t suitable for frontline NHS staff, from the investment firm Ayanda. She will accuse the chancellor of having a \u201ccavalier\u201d attitude to spending public money. Dodds will set out more details of what a Labour government would do to protect the jobs market in the coming months, including a \u201cnational retraining strategy\u201d to help prepare for alternative employment, and support for businesses who may struggle to repay the emergency loans they received from the Treasury. Labour has repeatedly warned about the risks of bringing the government\u2019s furlough scheme to an abrupt end next month, but had previously given few details about what should replace it, saying it must not be \u201cone size fits all\u201d. Dodds has been a relatively low-key figure since becoming Keir Starmer\u2019s surprise pick for shadow chancellor. Labour strategists are keen to raise her profile as they present the shadow cabinet as a government in waiting. She will contrast her record of campaigning for tougher financial regulation in parliament and before that as an MEP, with Sunak\u2019s past jobs in the City. \u201cWhile the chancellor was profiting from a financial system that took huge risks and then passed them on to ordinary people, I helped to rein it in,\u201d Dodds will say. Responding to reports of what Dodds planned to say, Steve Barclay MP, chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cAll Sir Keir Starmer and his team have to offer are the recycled economic plans of Jeremy Corbyn, which would hold our country back and hinder our recovery from coronavirus.\u201d Dodds\u2019 intervention comes as Labour seeks to put the pressure on the Conservatives for cronyism. Labour\u2019s leader in the House of Lords, Angela Smith, has written to the new cabinet secretary, calling the Tory peer Dido Harding\u2019s appointment to be head of the new National Institute for Health Protection a \u201cflagrant\u201d breach of the civil service code. Civil servants are not allowed to act \u201cin a way determined by party political considerations\u201d \u2013 but Harding has continued to vote on the Conservative side in the Lords."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
