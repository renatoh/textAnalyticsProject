Sue, the 51-year-old divorced mother of three who is in Malaysia at present, has inspired Tony Hall, a teacher of English in Macclesfield and his wife to head off round the world. Tony e-mailed Sue: \"How does it feel to be responsible for all the people you have inspired to travel? I have been reading your diaries since the first week and I have just read all the e-mails people have sent you. Thought you might like to know that you have done it again - my wife and I have decided to sell up, move to a smaller house with no mortgage and finance a trip around the world! Reading your diaries has given us a taste for adventure. It still feels like a massive step to take, especially the first bit - actually being on your own in a foreign world, culture, language etc. In your diaries you come across as being without fear and you sound very confident (you also sound as if you are having a great time, which is really bloody annoying to us in dear old Blighty!). \"Sorry I haven't got any tips for you, just admiration! \"Good luck for the rest of your travels.\" Sam , the civil servant who became fed up with his job, is in Australia at the moment. Jane says: \"Hi Sam, I see that you're off to Byron - it's fab there. Have a look at the Belongil Beach House - great hostel, bit of a walk along the beach but worth it for the fab caf\u00e9 attached to it. It's also worth hiring a bike and cycling up to the lighthouse - requires a bit of effort but it's worth it as you may get to see whales coming up the coast. \"Byron rocks, and if you want to stay somewhere a bit off the wall, try the Arts Factory. Also has a good outdoor cinema. Word of warning - don't learn to dive here, I tried and nearly drowned. They try and rush you through a three-day course - it isn't long enough. Enjoy. \"I'm very jealous. Keep the news coming.\" Milly, the 19-year-old gap year student who is in Sydney, got this from Margaret Darley this week: \"If you get the chance, get someone to buy you a meal at the Pig &amp; Olive in Potts Point: it's a gorgeous place.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
