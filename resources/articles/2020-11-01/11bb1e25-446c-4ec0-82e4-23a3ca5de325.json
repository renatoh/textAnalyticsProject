The world champion made the claim after victory at Sunday\u2019s Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola, suggesting that at the age of 35 he is ready to focus on \u201cfamily and those sort of things\u201d. Victory at Imola was Hamilton\u2019s ninth of the season and moved him ever closer to matching Michael Schumacher\u2019s record of seven F1 titles having already surpassed the German\u2019s record of Formula One race victories. The win also secured a seventh consecutive constructors\u2019 title for Mercedes, with whom Hamilton has yet to agree a new contract. It is a source of uncertainty for the team, which was significantly heightened on Sunday after the team principal, Toto Wolff, confirmed that while he will still be at Mercedes next year, he plans to step down from his current position. Hamilton and Wolff both joined Mercedes in 2013 and, when asked if Wolff\u2019s decision would have any impact, Hamilton was blunt. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m going to be here next year, so it\u2019s not really a concern for me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of deep conversations, Toto and I, so I\u2019m very aware of where he is mentally, and we share a lot of and carry a lot of the weight together. I\u2019ve been here a long, long time. I can definitely understand wanting to pull back a little bit and giving more time to family and those sort of things.\u201d This is Hamilton\u2019s 14th season in F1. He has suggested this season that signing a new contract with Mercedes was a formality, a matter of finding time to hammer out the details. Yet still no deal has been done. \u201cWell, we\u2019re in November, and Christmas isn\u2019t that far away,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel great, I feel still very strong, I feel I can keep going for plenty of months. There\u2019s multiple things that stay on the top of my mind. I would like to be here next year, but there\u2019s no guarantee of that for sure. There\u2019s a lot that excites me for the F1 afterlife, so time will tell.\u201d Wolff admitted that as things stood he could not be sure Hamilton would race on, although he is optimistic he would do so. \u201cNothing is ever secure,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could, like Niki Lauda in the 70s, wake up one morning at a track and say: \u2018I am just not having fun any more.\u2019 I think that can happen to anybody. But we want to continue this journey, we are not finished.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
