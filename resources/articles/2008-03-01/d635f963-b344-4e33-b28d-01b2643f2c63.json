Looking back at my own role before the invasion, I don't think we could have done anything differently. Mohamed ElBaradei and I, we tried to wake up the Iraqis and say 'Look, it's five minutes to midnight' and they did wake up in February 2003. It would be an enormous surprise if any evidence of weapons of mass destruction turned up now. They can be relics of the past, but not anything significant. The main lesson is that there are limitations to what you can achieve by military means. After the end of the Cold War, when people like Gorbachev were really very constructive, the chance to make a real peace was missed and the US became the only military superpower. They felt that they could do very good things with military pressure. Now we know it was a disaster. Barney White-Spunner Commander of all British troops in southern Iraq There was a huge debate about how the invasion was handled. Let's see what Iraq's like in five or 10 years and then pass judgment. There's a degree of sensationalism that's slightly distasteful in some of the people who've been commenting on what's happened. I'm not saying that everything's gone exactly according to plan, but then it never does. Given the rather tortuous path this poor country's been on in the last 15 years, I think the progress it's made is really encouraging. One of the things we're really trying to do with the Iraqi Security Forces is get them in a position where security is such that the economy can flourish. The great cry we have locally is that everyone wants it to be Dubai, not Mogadishu. It's a gradual process. I really do think it's got that potential. Rose Gentle Mother of Gordon Gentle, a soldier killed in Iraq, and a co-founder of Military Families Against the War The biggest legacy of this war will be all the lives that have been lost - people like my son, who would have survived if his unit had been kitted with vital bomb-jamming equipment. The morning that Gordon was killed I saw his body on TV, but I thought, no, we would have been told by now if it was him. After that, I started to ask why, why are we there, and dig a little bit deeper. But we are still there, and our troops are getting attacked even now. I think it's also important to recognise the damage it has done to the reputation of the army as a career. Where I live in Glasgow, it was something the young would look to as a good job for the future, but now many are questioning why they should put their lives on the line when the government isn't prepared to provide them with the basic resources. General Sir Michael Jackson Chief of the General Staff at the time of the invasion of Iraq There were wasted opportunities in the short-term aftermath of the conventional war. Three decisions were ill-judged: one was to disband the Iraqi security forces, the second was de-Baathification to a very low level and the third was the privatisation of state industries long before it was a strictly sensible thing to do. All of this took place in the summer of 2003 at Washington's behest. But I think it's too early to call, to draw the balance sheet, because there has been a lot going on in the last few months, on the political side as well as the military. The security situation, while still far from where it ought to be, is considerably better. The lesson from Iraq is that putting a country back on its feet in a post-conflict situation is very complex and requires far more than purely a military or a security dimension. Clare Short International Development Secretary at time of invasion of Iraq As I look at the situation in Iraq and the wider Middle East, I feel that Britain, the Labour Party and the British political system are deeply soiled. What has been done to Iraq is profoundly wrong. The suffering being imposed on the Palestinian people is creating a new apartheid system more vicious that that of South Africa. Britain sells arms to Saudi Arabia and Israel and has friendly relationships with the dictatorships of the Middle East. And then our clever but boyish Foreign Secretary tells us that the centrepiece of our foreign policy is support for democracy! The British party that supported the independence of India, that opposed Suez and kept out of Vietnam has become an abject supporter of US foreign policy that is causing a deep and just anger across the Middle East and the whole of the Muslim world. Ed Husain Author of The Islamist I was in Syria when US tanks rolled into Iraq. I remember the joy among young Arabs that one dictator had been toppled, and perhaps others would follow. Arab capitals would no longer be littered with monstrous statues of brutal, totalatarian rulers. A free press would emerge. There was hope in the air. And then everything changed. American soldiers, who were known for picking up cigarette stubs dropped by Iraqis, became vicious, inhumane occupiers. Their reputation was irrevocably damaged by Abu Ghuraib. Iraq is much worse place than it was under Saddam. Arab rulers can now justifiably claim that better their tyranny and corruption than US freedom. We are yet to admit that Western involvement is not always a positive development. There are other ways."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
