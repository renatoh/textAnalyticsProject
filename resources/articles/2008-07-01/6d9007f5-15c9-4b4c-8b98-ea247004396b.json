Booze, drugs and sex lead plausibly to a killing using the eponymous donkey punch (a dangerous way of heightening an orgasm) and fear, recrimination and general panic ensue in the dark, isolated, claustrophobic setting. The characters are weak and, in the case of the men, extremely dislikable, but despite an occasional lack of clarity Blackburn does a commendable job. Is it supposed to be a wake-up call for the binge-drinking generation? Perhaps. You certainly won't snooze through it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
