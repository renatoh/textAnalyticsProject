Long before the government came up with \"increased flexibility\", its initiative to give 14- to 16-year-olds at least part of their weekly tuition in further education, many schools and colleges were running similar schemes. These days no one would dream of dishing out the advice offered in the rhyme, at least not in such terms. But some in further education suspect its spirit lingers on. As the first cohort of youngsters completes two years of the increased flexibility programme, lecturers around the country worry their colleges are being used by schools to dump the most difficult pupils. Their anxieties are stoked by predictions that the number of schoolchildren who will be taking part in this initiative is set to rise sharply. Numbers are already estimated to have climbed above 120,000, and a proportion of these are strongly suspected to have been selected by their schools largely on nuisance grounds. Even those lecturers who believe the policy is fundamentally a good one suspect this might be the case. The critical ingredient for avoiding exploitation, it is commonly agreed, is partnership. That message is spelled out in Guidance for FE Colleges Providing for Young Learners, a chunky publication produced by the Association of Colleges (AoC) and the Local Education Authorities Curriculum Advisors' Network (Leacan), with funding from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). \"As partnerships have developed and there has been greater trust between schools and colleges, colleges have been more involved in the selection of young people, mainly to ensure that the kids are getting the right provision,\" says Susan Hayday, curriculum manager at the AoC and the driving force behind the guide. Good partnership is evidently the crux of the 14-16 operation at Bedford College, where the winning of a Beacon award from the AoC indicates it is a dab hand with this age group. Christine Highams, the college's head of schools-related education, says admission to any of the various schemes run by Bedford is negotiated individually with each youngster. \"But the negotiation tends to be with pupils who are not suited to the academic curriculum and who are at the lower end of the ability range.\" The college interviews all of the youngsters. In 10-minute sessions staff seek to establish that a pupil understands what they are embarking on. On top of this, the 14-year-olds do a couple of taster sessions, in which staff have the opportunity of appraising hand and communication skills, and readiness to listen and carry out instructions. The college accepts or turns down pupils on the basis of the interview and the tasters. \"Things that you might get away with in a classroom at school cannot be accepted for safety reasons when there is machinery around,\" Highams explains. This message has clearly got through to pupils coming to the end of the first year of a two-year increased flexibility construction course at the college, where spending one afternoon a week working with wood, bricks and cement has lit some sparks. \"You can't get childish on a building site,\" says Ayden James, 14. \"We are treated more like adults. It's nice - you feel more mature.\" \"I'm more creative with my hands than with writing and theory,\" says Joe McPhillips, 15. \"I've always wanted to be a builder.\" \"I had a rough idea of what I wanted to do and when I came to see what it was like, I realised it was for me,\" says Ayden. In the college's hair and beauty department, Chrizina Sellitto, 14, and 15-year-olds Sandra Robinson and Fabia Dilauro agree they like the college's approach. \"It's different,\" says Sandra. \"Here you call the teachers by their first names.\" \"They talk to us on the same level,\" Fabia adds. \"I prefer that. At school they talk down to us.\" Do they think the college's approach gets better results? \"Yes, because we understand what they are talking about.\" Where there is a good school-college partnership, pupils' progress is monitored; the school backing up the college with strategies for tackling poor behaviour and accepting that some youngsters will not last the course. \"We've had to exclude four this year,\" says Barbara Pound, who coordinates school-link courses at the College of North East London. \"The more the school works with the college, the more successful it is and the young people don't feel they've been abandoned and dumped. \"We've had young people who have almost stopped attending school, then they've come here and done beauty therapy, hairdressing, brick and timber work, and they've turned around,\" she says. \"It's the vocational atmos phere that seems to motivate them.\" She reckons about half of the youngsters coming to college win through. Of the 50% who don't, some simply quit. \"We're constantly battling with attendance,\" Pound says. \"I suppose if we get them to attend half the time when they didn't go to school at all, it's some achievement.\" Like others working in this field, Pound says this work cannot be achieved on the cheap, a sentiment endorsed by the outgoing chairman of the LSC, Bryan Sanderson. Safety alone dictates that these youngsters often need to be taught in small groups of no more than 10 or 12, and that is expensive. All agree that the \u00a340m Labour has put into increased flexibility is woefully inadequate. And good partnerships are not enough. Colleges are inevitably having to deploy more staff into this work. They have been able to take a voluntary approach, but as numbers rise it is inevitable that lecturers who consciously chose further education because they did not want to teach in schools will be deployed in this area. Dan Taubman, head of curriculum for the lecturers' union Natfhe, who helped put together the guide, says a voluntary approach will become less possible as numbers increase. In some cases, staff who have spent careers teaching students who attend because they want to learn, feel ill-equipped and nervous about dealing with youngsters of compulsory school age. Proper training and staff development are essential, he says. However, says Susan Hayday, \"Colleges are saying that when they overcome that initial resistance and unwillingness, staff can become enthusiastic about turning young people around.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
