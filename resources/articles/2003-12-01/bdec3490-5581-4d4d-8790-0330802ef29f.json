It treats the spirit of Christmas as though it were the Aids virus, and merrily plants a fat, dirty thumb right in Saint Nick's eye. Billy Bob Thornton is Willie Stokes, a foul-mouthed, alcoholic, chain-smoking, philandering safe-breaker who each year sets himself up as a shopping-mall Santa, bringing along his midget pal Marcus (Tony Cox) as elf and criminal co-conspirator. Each year they spend two weeks casing a new mall, before locking themselves in on Christmas Eve, emptying the safe and fleeing. This year things are complicated by a greedy store detective (Bernie Mac) who wants half their cut, and a fat, put-upon little boy towards whom Willie develops improbable paternal instincts. But don't fret: this isn't one of those movies where people have \"epiphanies\" or undergo extreme personal transformation. None of that interests Zwigoff much; he's more concerned with being unapologetically thorough in his demolition of Christmas, and the energy with which he expresses his dislike is something to see. Like his documentary Crumb and his feature Ghost World, Bad Santa relies for its success on Zwigoff's sad-sack world view, one characterised by rage, frustration and an ungovernable enthusiasm for amply-bottomed women, and on his sympathy for aggressive, proud outcasts, angry and adrift in a banal America of shopping malls and cookie-cutter suburbs. Zwigoff's curmudgeonly demeanour cannot be mixed with the Christmas season - when one's almost strongarmed into being amenable - without some interesting fireworks ensuing. Thus, during the course of the movie we get to see Santa vomiting, Santa yelling obscenities at eight-year-olds, Santa pissing his pants, Santa waving a broken bottle around as he destroys his own grotto, Santa getting it on, and Santa screaming, \"Jesus Christ, can't you see it's my goddamn lunch break?\" at a bothersome mother. Bolstered by Thornton's vanity-free performance, Bad Santa does an impressive job of keeping its unwholesome characters sympathetic. This is definitely not a movie for children - and more power to it for styling itself exactly thus - but we grown-ups can settle down for a heart-warming hurricane of obscenities, scatology, cynicism and seasonal icon-smashing. All of which should be catnip to anyone who's ever dreamed of burning the negative of It's a Wonderful Life. Ron Howard, the man who ruined last Christmas by directing How The Grinch Stole Christmas, is back with, of all things, a western. Happily, The Missing is nothing like Far and Away, his last outing in this genre, and more like his best movie, Ransom, which also dealt with a child abduction. Less happily, it bears a strong resemblance, with its story of the quest for a white girl captured by Indians, to John Ford's 1956 masterpiece, The Searchers. Howard has been on the talk shows this week displaying mild annoyance every time the Ford movie gets mentioned. Given that the Indian captivity-narrative is America's oldest story archetype, you can see his point. However, the similarities, which I imagine are lifted from the source novel by Thomas Edison, are hard to ignore. Whereas John Wayne and Jeffrey Hunter sought their abducted niece, here it's plains-woman Cate Blanchett and her long-estranged father Tommy Lee Jones who set off after a band of Apache intent on selling her daughter and other captives as slaves in Mexico. Jones returns after a long absence, like Wayne's Ethan Edwards, and like him is conversant with both the wilderness and civilisation. In The Searchers the captive was Natalie Wood; here it's Evan Rachel Wood. Sounds awfully familiar. None of this would matter if Howard had struck out for new territory. He hasn't. Certainly he has made a grim, efficient western, filled with more violence and bloodshed than all his other movies put together, and he has drawn equally efficient performances from his players. But where Ford galvanised his piece by focusing on the Wayne character's virulent racism and irrational fear of miscegenation, Howard is stuck with yet another script about how families are put back together, a theme Hollywood has already beaten to death. This doesn't detract from the film's high points, chief of which are its Apache villain, a renegade \"brujo\" or witch, of startling cruelty and deviousness who will give your children nightmares, and the performance of Blanchett, poised, bitter and vengeful. Jones gives the same performance he's been giving for the past 10 years, which is to say he's excellent, but somehow over-familiar in his renegade posturing and clipped delivery. The Missing could use a Zwigoff-like Bad Lone Ranger behind the camera instead of timid Richie Cunningham, and this lack of an extra dimension or a driving intelligence to the movie means it can't compete with truly innovative recent westerns like The Ballad of Little Jo or Jarmusch's sublime Dead Man."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
