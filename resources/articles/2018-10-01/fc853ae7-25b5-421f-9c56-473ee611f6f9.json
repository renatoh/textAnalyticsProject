No Liverpool team in history have conceded as few as three goals in the opening nine matches of a league campaign but that record can be achieved with a clean sheet at Huddersfield Town on Saturday. Klopp admits the focus on defensive improvement has had a detrimental effect on Liverpool\u2019s forward play, with Mohamed Salah, Sadio Man\u00e9 and Roberto Firmino yet to recapture last season\u2019s heights, but was necessary to provide a platform for a title challenge. He insists Liverpool can develop defensively \u201cwithout killing our nature\u201d. The Liverpool manager, who could have Salah and Man\u00e9 available after injury problems on international duty, said: \u201cWe want to be stronger defensively but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have interest in offensive things. It is normal in a period of adaptation. You put the focus a bit more on something \u2013 close this gap, close this space \u2013 and immediately you lose a bit of the fluency in something else. But we have created enough chances; it\u2019s just that we didn\u2019t use them like we used them in the best period of last season. \u201cWe have had good results and scored goals but it\u2019s obvious we can improve. We need to keep the stability, no doubt about that. What we\u2019ve done defensively so far is credit to the whole team. We don\u2019t concede a lot of shots in general. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t concede because Alisson makes one world-class save after another. We don\u2019t let them shoot often and that\u2019s the best thing.\u201d Liverpool rank ninth for the effectiveness of their pressing game among Premier League teams this season, according to Opta. Klopp believes the statistic reflects a change in tactics against Liverpool \u2013 and his team\u2019s maturity when in winning positions \u2013 rather than a radical departure from pressing on his part. \u201cIt\u2019s more the case that teams don\u2019t usually play against us,\u201d explained Klopp. \u201cThey overplay our pressing with long balls, which makes sense. In a lot of games our counter-press has been really good, which is much more important in terms of losing the ball and winning it back. In terms of the high press, it depends on the style of play of the other team. You can\u2019t do it if they don\u2019t play. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to do it any more. If they play then we should be there. \u201cIt\u2019s not been a proper plan to sit back a little bit more but we have done that after being 1-0 or 2-0 up in games. We did sit back a bit more to not give space away, that\u2019s true. It\u2019s a question of maturity and that makes absolute sense. With the number of games we have it\u2019s not about chasing a game always like crazy, you have to be smart. We try to be that without killing our nature.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
