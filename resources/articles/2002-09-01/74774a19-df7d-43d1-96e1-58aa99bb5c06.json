Whether his sentiments were designed to sweep temporarily under the carpet the financial crisis which threatens Derby's existence or just a pre-emptive effort to temper the personal abuse that would follow defeat is unknown. The \"Pickering out\" chants started long before Derby squandered Adam Bolder's goal and a dominant first-half performance with a dreadful display after the interval. Come the final whistle the dissidents had increased in number, likewise the volume of their protests which, for Derby manager John Gregory, was unsurprising but out of character. \"The crowd have been exceptionally patient with the players, the management and the board,\" he said. Perhaps that is part of the problem. The buck for debts of \u00a330m, fuelled by outlandish salaries for average players, has to stop somewhere. Goodness knows what another trenchant football club chairman, the late Bob Lord of Burnley, would make of the current pickle at Pride Park but he would surely have approved of the old-fashioned wing and inside forward play from Glen Little and Robbie Blake which tilted the game Burnley's way. The introduction of Little for the second half not only galvanised Burnley but also Blake, who converted the equalising penalty after being fouled by Chris Riggott. Blake followed up by driving in the low cross which Warren Barton sliced into his own goal to give Burnley their first win of the campaign and lift them off the foot of the table. \"We're off the bottom now and have got to build on this,\" said the Burnley manager, Stan Ternent. \"But we will be staying in the First Division - there are no doubts about that.\" Whether Derby will remain there with them as a going concern is another matter. Man of the match: Robbie Blake (Burnley)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
