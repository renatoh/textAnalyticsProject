Both leaders stressed that the result could be very close as they toured marginal seats across the country with just 24 hours to go before the ballot boxes open on Thursday. In his message to voters on the eve of Thursday\u2019s general election vote, Corbyn claimed the country stands at a \u201cfork in the road,\u201d with a \u201ctruly historic\u201d choice between parties that have widely different values and policies. \u201cTomorrow you can shock the establishment, by voting for hope,\u201d he told a rally in Hoxton in east London. \u201cHope for yourself. Hope for your family. Hope for your community. Hope for our NHS. Hope for our country. Tomorrow, vote for hope. Vote for real change. \u201cThe establishment doesn\u2019t want Labour to win.\u201d Corbyn also hammered home his core message from throughout the campaign, that Johnson would \u201copen our NHS to takeover by American mega-corporations and carry on with more cuts\u201d, saying that was why US president Donald Trump wants the prime minister to hold on to power. Johnson hosted his own rally not far away from his rival in the Olympic Park in east London, making his message all about his determination to carry out Brexit. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d he said in remarks released ahead of Wednesday night\u2019s rally. \u201cThis election is our chance to end the gridlock but the result is on a knife-edge.\u201d He also repeated his claim that if the Conservatives fail to win a majority then Corbyn would have to seek a deal with the Scottish National party, leading to second referendums both on the EU and Scottish independence. \u201cToday is our chance to unite as a country and put the uncertainty to bed so people can get on with their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cJust imagine how wonderful it will be to settle down to a turkey dinner this Christmas with Brexit decided \u2013 and how awful it would be if Corbyn and Sturgeon were in Downing Street advancing their plans for two more referendums.\u201d Johnson criss-crossed England and Wales on Wednesday, taking part in a series of carefully staged business visits and photo calls, aimed at underlining his determination to press ahead with Brexit. The PM has come under intense scrutiny in recent days. The father of London Bridge attack victim Jack Merritt accused Johnson of seeing his son\u2019s death as a political opportunity. Johnson was also criticised for his reaction to the case of a four-year-old boy pictured sleeping on the floor of a Leeds hospital \u2013 an image he appeared reluctant to confront when asked about it on Monday. Conservative sources also had to deny that Johnson had hid in a fridge to escape from TV reporters on Wednesday. Corbyn kicked off his countrywide tour with an early morning rally in Glasgow, before taking in Middlesbrough and Bedford on his way back to the capital. With the Liberal Democrats urging voters to back the party most likely to defeat the Conservatives and prevent a hard Brexit, and Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party threatening to split the Brexit vote in many of the Labour seats Johnson is targeting, the result is highly unpredictable. If Labour denies Johnson a majority, it will vindicate Corbyn\u2019s decision \u2013 controversial among many senior figures in his party \u2013 to back the prime minister\u2019s demand for a snap poll at the third time of asking. The Labour leader told the Guardian at the start of the campaign: \u201cI didn\u2019t alert anybody in advance \u2013 it was my decision. On my own. I made that decision. And they gulped, and said, \u2018Yes Jeremy.\u2019\u201d Labour has said it would seek to run as a minority administration rather than seeking a formal deal with the SNP or any other party. However, it is a real prospect that Labour could look for a confidence and supply arrangement with the SNP, Lib Dems and other pro-second referendum parties if both Corbyn and Johnson fall short of a majority. The polls are currently pointing to a lead for the Tories of between six and 15 points, which suggests anything between a hung parliament and a convincing majority for Johnson. With such uncertainty, there is nervousness in both the Tory and Labour campaign teams. Labour declared victory in the social media campaign on Wednesday night, with pro-Corbyn campaign group Momentum saying its election videos had been viewed by nearly half of the UK\u2019s Facebook users. Their analysis has shown that 17m of the UK\u2019s 36m Facebook users have watched Momentum videos since the election campaign began, compared with 13m during the seven weeks of the 2017 campaign. In a final attempt to get the vote out for Labour the group released another video with actor Steve Coogan, Primal Scream frontman Bobby Gillespie and comedian Josie Long with a soundtrack provided by Brian Eno. Laura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, said: \u201cThe Tories may have a handful of billionaire press barons on their side, but we have tens of thousands of people across the country sharing our videos to millions. They\u2019re allowing our message to cut through the unprecedented levels of media bias we\u2019ve seen this election.\u201d The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who has played a key role in organising Labour\u2019s campaign, used an article in the Guardian to warn that if Johnson wins a majority, it would usher in a \u201cpolitical dark age, dominated by extreme rightwing populism\u201d. \u201cWe will face a Johnson government \u2013 with its establishment allies owning most of our print newspapers, with a proven ability to bully and dominate broadcast media, and a capacity to buy up dark ads across social media \u2013 that is able to manipulate our politics on a scale we have never seen in this country,\u201d he wrote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
