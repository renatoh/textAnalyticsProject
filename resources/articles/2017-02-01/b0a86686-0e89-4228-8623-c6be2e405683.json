But his elation turns to confusion when it becomes clear that he and his fellow detainees are anything but free. Meanwhile, there are the two ever-present options Aziz has to get out of detention. Officials are always reminding him that he can just go home, or he could agree to be resettled in Papua New Guinea. Aziz tells us why he can\u2019t possibly take either of those options, and explains just exactly what the court ruling means for him: vindication. I haven\u2019t been excited like this since I came to Manus and today is my first day that I\u2019m really smiling and it\u2019s really smile, like it\u2019s not I\u2019m pretending but I\u2019m really smiling from my heart. \u2022 The Messenger is a 10-part podcast series co-produced by Behind the Wire and the Wheeler Centre.
