This British Council site, called simply Literary Translation, is dedicated to exploring the role of the translator and the challenges of translation. As well as being wonderfully clear and easy to navigate, it succeeds in offering content of interest to both the casual browser (for, as the site says in its introduction, \"all reading is, in a sense, a kind of translation\") and those with a professional interest in the subject. The three main sections of the site comprise workshops by translators; an excellent annotated resources section; and discussion boards. There is also an up-to-date news page and events listing. The workshops are the fun part, though, with the suggestion that readers attempt a translation of the Bible, or explore the translation of swearwords through Irvine Welsh's expletive-laden Trainspotting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
