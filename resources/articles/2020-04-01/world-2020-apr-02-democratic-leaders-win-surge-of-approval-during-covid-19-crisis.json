Will Jennings, a professor of political science at Southampton University, said the increases were due to an effect first identified in 1970 by a US political scientist, John Mueller, in a paper examining the popularity of US presidents in times of crisis. \u201cIn the context of the cold war, Mueller looked at presidential approval data dating back to the 1940s. He observed that it spiked significantly at major moments of tension like, say, the Cuban missile crisis,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cHe defined this \u2018rally round the flag\u2019 effect as coming from an international event that directly involved the president, and was \u2018dramatic, specific and sharply focused\u2019. That pretty much perfectly describes the coronavirus crisis.\u201d Some leaders have seen spectacular rises. The popularity of Giuseppe Conte, the law professor who became Italy\u2019s prime minister in 2018, has surged to 71%, even as his country recorded the highest number of coronavirus deaths in the world. Angela Merkel, who is in her fourth term as Germany\u2019s chancellor and has announced she will not be standing again, has seen her approval rating rise by 11 points since early March to a startling 79%, according to Forschungsgruppe Wahlen\u2019s barometer. In France, a series of polls has shown the satisfaction rating with Emmanuel Macron surging by up to 14 points since February to between 46% and 51% \u2013 the highest score the French president has registered in the better part of 18 months. Even when leaders are seen as having mishandled the Covid-19 outbreak, their popularity has increased. In the UK, an Ipsos Mori poll found that despite widespread criticism of his government\u2019s approach, Boris Johnson has seen his satisfaction rating put on more than five percentage points since early February. The same story has unfolded in the US, where Gallup found that while Donald Trump, too, has been castigated for his dismissive early response to the impending crisis, 49% of voters approve of his performance \u2013 the most since he entered the White House. The most comparable recent example of \u201crally round the flag\u201d, Jennings said, was the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, when the approval rating of President George W Bush briefly hit 90%, the highest ever seen for a US president \u2013 and was still riding high at nearly 70% a year later. Researchers originally theorised that the effect was due to leaders appearing as \u201cnational unifying figures\u201d. More recently, they have suggested it may be because politics and the media become less partisan, or when people feel threatened, they look to an authority figure to protect them. \u201cOne school believes that when partisan differences are set aside, and the media coverage becomes more unified \u2013 when the cues people are getting change \u2013 that creates a space for the leader to be viewed more positively,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cThe other explanation is more based on social psychology.\u201d Whatever it is that drives it, \u201crally round the flag\u201d generally has the effect of pushing opposition parties and their leaders \u2013 particularly those, such as western Europe\u2019s far-right populists, who habitually attack governments aggressively \u2013 out of the spotlight. France\u2019s Marine Le Pen, Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini and the leaders of Germany\u2019s AfD have lost ground in the polls: Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally, is down three points according to the latest Elabe barometer; Salvini\u2019s Lega has shed between two and four. They have also become less vocal as the pandemic has advanced. But that does not mean they will be gone for long. \u201cWe will see a time of reckoning when this is all over,\u201d said Catherine Fieschi, director of the Global Policy Institute at Queen Mary University of London, and a leading expert on far-right populism. \u201cFor the moment, they are biding their time. But we risk seeing a big resurgence.\u201d Europe could well see \u201can economic crisis after this health crisis \u2013 with a social crisis as a consequence\u201d, Fieschi said. \u201cPeople without jobs, high unemployment. No matter how much governments \u2013 and, of course, the EU \u2013 have done, it will never be seen to have been enough. No incumbent leader can run on a platform of \u2018but it could have been so much worse\u2019. And that\u2019s the populists\u2019 opportunity.\u201d Italy in particular risks an explosion of populist support, Fieschi said. \u201cIf the Germans and the Dutch continue to block some kind of collective support mechanism, the Italians are going to feel this is the third time \u2013 after the financial crisis and the refugee crisis \u2013 that they\u2019ve been hung out to dry. Salvini will jump on it.\u201d Jennings agreed. \u201cNow isn\u2019t the time for populist leaders to attack,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be seen as going against the flow, as unpatriotic \u2013 undermining the very principles they stand for. But as the crisis subsides, and inquiries are begun into how it was handled, their \u2018elites failing the people\u2019 narrative will be back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
