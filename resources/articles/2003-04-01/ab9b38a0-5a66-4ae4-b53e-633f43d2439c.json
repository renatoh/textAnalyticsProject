Bush is said to remember with affection the two years he spent studying for an MBA at Harvard, but his war in Iraq seems to have done nothing but damage to the market for British and American MBAs. Business schools in Britain report a small but noticeable downturn in enquiries and applications in the last two months, while in many US schools the downturn is said to be very sharp. But some business schools in anti-war nations like France, Belgium and Germany have a very different story to tell. Several reasons are offered for the anglophone downturn, though no one is sure which are the most important. Air travel is considered hazardous in wartime, which cuts down on overseas applications. These constitute more than half the MBA students at Britain's most prestigious business schools, since they generally consider it essential to have a large proportion of overseas students to back up their claim to equip managers for the global economy. Some people do not like to travel, while some US companies have banned air travel for their staff. But, proportionately, the biggest drop in applications seems to be from the Middle East. Pro-western oil-rich countries like Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have been sending a relatively large number of people to study MBAs at British and American business schools, and until war clouds darkened the horizon, their numbers were increasing. Now, that lucrative business has dropped right off. In the US this may in part be caused by visa problems for those coming from the Middle East. In Israel, where business was already in sharp decline, it's a similar story. In the last two years, Israelis have had more immediate things to worry about than educating their management cadre. Henley Management College was forced to close its Tel Aviv centre two years ago because of declining demand, though until then it had been quite successful. Henley, which offers MBAs by distance learning, used the centre for workshops with Israeli students. Now the few Israelis who still study for a Henley MBA have to make occasional forays for face-to-face sessions at the college's nearest centre, in Cyprus, which is called Henley East Mediterranean. There, they rub shoulders with the centre's Lebanese students. The problem in Israel was not just a drop in demand, but a market increasingly populated with low-cost alternatives. \"When we entered Israel we were the biggest provider,\" says Michael Pitfield, Henley's director of corporate relations. \"But local and overseas organisations were competing on time and price, and to compete with them meant lowering the standard, which we were not willing to do. The market there was contracting and moving towards shorter and cheaper products.\" In the last few weeks, says Mr Pitfield, \"there has been a lot of uncertainty about everything, including the economy. In times like that, people are cautious and they postpone major decisions.\" But it may also be that the anti-war stance of France, Belgium and Germany is paying off for their business schools. At Vlerick Leuven Gent management school in Belgium, the number of applications has more than doubled since last year. Between 5-10% MBA intake comes from the Middle East, and the proportion looks set to rise. The flow of applicants from pro-western Arab nations has not fallen off as it has in the UK and the US, while last year saw the school's first ever Palestinian. \"With the war, people are looking at what sort of culture they want to be a part of,\" explains Vlerick Leuven Gent's director of international development, Peter Rafferty. \"The US influence in Iraq will mean increased interest in coming to Europe. I think schools in our situation will be seen to be in countries that are much less partisan. Students coming here could be making a very strong statement about what their own aspirations are. We know that schools in the US have seen a sharp decline in their applications, while ours have increased.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
