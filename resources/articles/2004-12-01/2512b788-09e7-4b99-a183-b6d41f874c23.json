Explore on Foot is the first dedicated trekking brochure from Explore Worldwide (0870 3334001, explore.co.uk). It offers 10 new trips including strenuous hikes in Greenland or India's Ladakh pilgrimage trail, which are guaranteed to remove at least a Christmas pudding. It also introduces more gentle routes, removing just a couple of turkey legs, in Chianti and Northern Cyprus. Another first is Walkers' Britain from Sherpa (020-8577 2717, sherpa-walking-holidays.co.uk), offering domestic self-guided routes such as the Lady Anne Way, an eight-day yomp through the Yorkshire Dales and the Cornish Coastal Path. Sherpa has also added Austria and the Azores to its collection. At \u00a31,250 including flights via Lisbon, the 12-day escorted Azorean hiking trips take in four islands, including a climb up Mt Pico, the highest Portuguese mountain, and a crater walk on S\u00e3o Miguel. Exodus (0870 2405550, exodus.co.uk) has been even more prolific, introducing 33 new routes for 2005 including Tanzanian mountains and Cuban jungle. Wonderful. Abandon all restraint this instant. Indulge now, hike later. Drink and be merry Planning a last-minute trip for Christmas or the New Year? If heavy imbibing's likely (surely not?) you might want to heed the advice of tippling guru Simon Berry of Berry Bros &amp; Rudd on where to go. Head to St Julien in Bordeaux and follow the maxim: the older, the redder, the better. A 10- to 15-year-old local vintage, like a 1990 Ch Gruaud-Larose, is the ultimate for avoiding a sore head. If white's your poison make for C\u00f4te de Beaune in Burgundy and choose a 10- to 12-year-old variety that has taken time to mature naturally. A 1992 Corton-Charlemagne is \"wonderfully well balanced\". As your temples and eyesight will be next morning. Or you could go to Cigliuti in Italy and chug several glasses of organic 2000 Barbaresco. The men who swig, spit and gurgle believe quality organic wines, which minimise the use of sulphur as a preservative, are easier on the head. Alternatively, book into Sante Winelands Hotel (itcclassics.co.uk) near Franschhoek in South Africa where they offer a shiraz scrub, chardonnay cocoon wrap and cabernet sauvignon bath. Cheers! Stretch and drive Having slipped between the sheets with skiing, yoga is now becoming a bedfellow for several other sporting holidays. Started by two British climbers, Beyond (020-7226 4044, beyondretreats.co.uk) has introduced cross-training programmes, fusing the yogic hat trick of stretching, focused breathing and mental serenity with golf, hiking and climbing. The company's 2005 breaks offer yoga instruction combined with climbing in the Peak District, rambling in County Durham or Sicily's Madonie Mountains, and serious walking in Nepal, as well as with skiing in Chamonix and - once the snow's melted presumably - with chipping, putting and driving at golf courses near the French resort. \"Yoga helps you get in synch, become stronger, more flexible,\" says Beyond's Jacqui Sread, \"so you relax and focus on breathing, movement and vision - a similar state to when athletes talk of 'being in the zone'.\" The courses start from \u00a3395 for a weekend's yoga and hiking in the UK, use English instructors and suit all levels. And finally... ... if you haven't splashed out enough on your little darlings this festive period - or are desperately looking for a late present - Seaham Hall's Serenity Spa (seaham-hall.com) is now offering eight treatments specifically designed for 13- to 16-year-olds, starting \"from as little as \u00a335\" (make that Christmas and birthday). They include the Chocolate Facial, which cleanses, detoxes and moisturises - but apparently doesn't provoke teenage acne."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
