Kano's rather great new track, This Is The Girl, is interrupted with the smash of a snare and Jay-Z's \"uh-huh, uh-huh\" adlibs. Oh, ace, I think, Rihanna's Umbrella-ella-ella. Even though it's been in the charts eight-million months, it's a fantastic single to throw some shapes to. I'm midway through my Rihanna hip-wriggling when there's a noise that I've never heard on the record before. There it is again: a click, swish and ploop. I turn around and behold, proudly swinging in the wind, well air-con, is a Burberry patterned brolly. Another click, swish and ploop as one more umbrella is raised in homage to the tune. Within seconds, four of the buggers are circling around the club, their owners hidden beneath polka dots, a splash of pink and one particularly snazzy Louis Vuitton number. I contemplate grabbing my own, before realising I'm rolling with a broken and battered \u00a32.99 Tesco special. This may be my first encounter of Rihanna dancefloor rites, but there must be an etiquette involved here. Though I've yet to experience this anywhere else in clubland, Graham Jacotine, manager of The Kingly Club, points out it's becoming a common occurrence. \"We don't usually play R&amp;B, but that song always goes down really well. It's funny seeing all the umbrellas come out and it's not the first time it's happened. But I suppose there has been a lot of rain recently, so it shows people getting into swing of things. Mind you, we probably won't encourage it too much in case they poke someone's eye out!\" I've seen many accessories in clubland before, from head-to-toe Moschino at UK garage raves to gun-fingers in grime. The rave scene took no shame in sporting whistles, white gloves and jumpsuits. In hip-hop, you were nothing without a bottle of Henny or M\u00f6et clutched in your right hand. I even dimly remember a craze for swimming goggles at R&amp;B nights at one point, while vogueing is making a big comeback on the gay scene. But I can honestly say I've never witnessed anything as odd as four undulating umbrellas circulating the dancefloor as Rihanna's Barbadian tones professed undying commitment to her lover, whatever the weather. Quite a surreal moment. It also got me thinking about the stick old Rhi-Rhi has been getting of late. The thinking goes that until she's displaced from that No 1 spot, we'll continue to have this bad weather. Umbrella = rain so put it away love, and we can all get some frickin' sun. But now I realise the 19 year-old isn't entirely to blame after all. It's these umbrella-wielding fools that are tempting bad luck by committing No 1 in the Top 10 of Superstitious Sins. Everyone knows how much bad luck opening an umbrella inside is supposed to bring. You might as well not touch wood or purposefully spill some salt. Heaven knows how much drizzle these chancer-dancers have bought upon our heads with their admittedly witty indoor accessorising. So, Rihanna, accept our humble apology-ology-ology - we know it's not all your fault love."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
