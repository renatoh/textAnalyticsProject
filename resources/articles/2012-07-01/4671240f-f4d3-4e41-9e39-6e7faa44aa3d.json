The guidance, which was published by the government for consultation, is aimed at creating greater consistency of speed limits on local roads across England and incorporates recent changes that have also increased flexibility for councils to implement 20mph limits. The road safety minister, Mike Penning, said the guidance does not propose a blanket change to rural road speed limits. But he added: \"40mph limits should be considered for sections of rural roads where there are many bends, junctions or accesses, and speeds are already at 40mph or below. Any changes to a speed limit would be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis.\" Penning added: \"It is vital that speed limits are suitable for local conditions and councils are best placed to determine what these limits are, based on local knowledge and the views of the community.\" More than two-thirds of all road deaths take place on rural roads, which have proved to be consistently more dangerous than urban ones. Details of a new speed limit appraisal web tool designed to help authorities assess the impact of any change to a speed limit in their area were also provided. It will be launched later this year. Recent figures show the first annual rise in road deaths in 17 years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
