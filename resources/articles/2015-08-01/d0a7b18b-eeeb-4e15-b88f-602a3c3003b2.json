The Liverpool striker underwent a hip operation in New York in May to resolve several long-standing injury problems that restricted the 25-year-old to only 18 appearances for Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team last season. Sturridge has spent the majority of his recovery period in Boston under the auspices of the Red Sox\u2019s sports science and medical staff, also employed by Liverpool\u2019s owners, Fenway Sports Group. He has been assessed in Boston this week by Glen Driscoll and Chris Morgan, Liverpool\u2019s head of performance and head of physiotherapy respectively, and is due to travel back to Melwood with the pair this weekend having responded well to the operation and fitness programme. The England international will be eased back into first-team training initially, with Liverpool reluctant to take any risks on a player who suffered two thigh injuries, a calf strain and a hip problem last season. However, Sturridge is expected to be in contention for a competitive return after three weeks\u2019 training, giving the striker a chance of featuring in the trip to Old Trafford. Liverpool, meanwhile, are continuing to assess Jordan Henderson\u2019s foot injury before their Premier League game at Arsenal on Monday. The club captain has not discovered the extent of a problem that forced him out of the win over Bournemouth. Henderson had a scan on his foot on Tuesday but will be monitored daily."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
