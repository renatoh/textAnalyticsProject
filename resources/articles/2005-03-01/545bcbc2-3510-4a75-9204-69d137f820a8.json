In this case, for example, we might want to find out how the Ukrainian British differ from their Anglo-Saxon neighbours. Books and films about the UK's many ethnic groups appear regularly and, even if they do not gain popularity, they are considered with interest. Add to this the Orange Revolution effect, and I am sure that Marina Lewycka's A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian will gain the attention of any inquisitive reader. Regrettably, however, this novel will not leave the reader any the wiser about the Ukrainian community in England. What we are offered is the banal tale of a Ukrainian woman who enters the UK on a tourist visa and who is prepared to go to any lengths to remain in the country. Her name is Valentina. To get a British passport, she is prepared to marry an elderly man, Nikolai, for whom she has no affection. The marriage would also provide the opportunity of \"oxfordcambridge education\" for her teenage son, who has come with her to the UK. For Nikolai's part, this union inspires the return of sexual fantasies that are quite at odds with his physical capabilities. Valentina is by no means lazy. She works very hard every day, illegally of course, in an old people's home, and she spends most of her nights with another Englishman. Thus we have a picture of an assiduous but utterly evil woman. The only people capable of opposing this evil are two other women who have Ukrainian blood in their veins: Nikolai's daughters, who have long since become law-abiding British citizens. Despite the best efforts of the two sisters, their father marries the young blonde. On her rare appearances at home, the new wife bullies her elderly husband both physically and psychologically. The sisters telephone and write to the immigration authorities, but the bureaucrats are reluctant to get involved. It is only when Valentina promises to speed up her husband's death that the old man agrees to file for divorce. Thus, in the end, all hope rests with the British legal system. The rhythm and dynamics of this debut novel are well managed and Lewycka succeeds in creating many comic situations. But the novel is not so much written as constructed, and the same can be said of the characters. Just about everyone portrayed in it inspires the sympathy of the reader except the Ukrainians, legal and illegal. What we see are caricatures. Valentina's enormous breasts are mentioned dozens of times. Her bad taste in clothes (she has a passion for green satin underwear) and her dislike of cooking are exploited in the same way. She is more like a rubber doll than a real person. The old man is almost always seen in pyjamas or naked, as a symbol of the impotence of old age. He occasionally inserts a Ukrainian word into his English sentences, and sometimes he reads aloud from his manuscript about the history of tractors. The younger sister, Nadezhda, reminisces about Ukraine and ponders the country's history. She dwells on well-known tragic events: the famine, Nazi occupation, Stalin's purges, Babi Yar. The hard realism of these images is in stark contrast with the grotesque main plot. Reading this novel gave me the impression that I had read a school textbook on Ukrainian history with one eye on an episode of Coronation Street. \u00b7 Andrey Kurkov is the author of Death and the Penguin (Harvill)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
