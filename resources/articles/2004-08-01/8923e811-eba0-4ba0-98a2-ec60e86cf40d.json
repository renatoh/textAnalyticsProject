Although some other gas and electricity suppliers are expected to follow last week's price hike announcements from British Gas, uSwitch.com says that switching will still be worthwhile. 'We do expect a couple of other companies to make price increases, but they will not be as big as those from British Gas,' says Jennifer Evans of uSwitch. Switching can take several weeks, although the calculation of whether it is worthwhile and initial instructions to suppliers can be done in minutes through websites such as www.simplyswitch.com (0800 781 1212), www.uSwitch.com (0800 093 0607) and www.TheEnergyShop.com. Making allowances If you are 60 or over on or before September 26, you should be eligible for winter fuel allowance of \u00a3200 for your household this year. The Department of Work and Pensions will automatically know about you if you are in receipt of a pension or other benefit (except housing benefit, council tax benefit and child benefit), but if this is not the case you will need to apply. Application can be made through www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/winterfuel or via 08459 151515. If you are 70 or over, your household should qualify for a \u00a3100 'age-related allowance'. If you are 80 or over, another payment of up to \u00a3100 may be available. All payments are tax-free and do not affect entitlements to benefits. The age-related allowance is meant to be a one-off for 2004/05, but Help the Aged expects the Chancellor to extend it for 2005/06 since the Budget is likely to Fuel for thought: leaving British Gas fall just before the next general election. Insurance storm warning Homeowners should check their policies for storm damage cover, according to insuresupermarket.com. 'Check the small print to ensure that you are covered for outbuildings and property boundaries such as fences and walls,' says Richard Mason of insuresupermarket.com. 'As a rule, few insurers decline to cover storm damage,' he adds. 'However, it may not be long before they do. Norwich Union has already launched its flood map. Many more people who once were able to get reasonably cheap insurance could see their premiums increase.' Cost is the driving force Running costs are weighing increasingly heavily in the minds of people buying a car, according to AA Insurance. More than eight out of 10 are influenced in their choice by the expected fuel cost and and seven in 10 by the insurance cost. Neale Phillips of AA says: 'The cost of running an average family car is now over \u00a35,000 a year, so finding ways to cut this cost is high on a typical buyer's list of priorities.' Joined-up thinking PLANS for a one-stop advice and benefits shop for pensioners were unveiled last week by the Department for Work and Pensions. Under the proposals, 'joint visiting teams' from the Pension Service, local authorities and benefits staff could deal with the elderly and bring together housing and social care matters into a 'single assessment process'. Organisations such as Age Concern could take claims for benefits and verify documents. The loan arranger Wondering how you'll cope with higher mortgage rates?
