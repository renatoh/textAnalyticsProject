Unexpected results, not least Munster's extraordinary weekend success over Gloucester, have paired the Irish province with the Tigers, who beat them controversially in last year's final at the Millennium Stadium. No one in Munster has for gotten Neil Back's infamous \"Hand of God\" intervention at a scrum in the closing stages of Leicester's 15-9 win last May and the desire to win a European title burns fiercely in a squad who have lost two finals in the past three seasons. By the time the quarter-finals are played on the weekend of April 12-13 the Munster coach Alan Gaffney is also confident his team will be even stronger than at Thomond Park on Saturday. Two experienced Lions, David Wallace and Rob Henderson, are seeing a specialist today with hopes of returning to action soon. Gaffney's tal ented young lock Paul O'Connell is on the mend after breaking a thumb, and the wings Anthony Horgan and John O'Neill will also be available when Munster visit Welford Road. Irish hopes could increase further next Monday with the draw for semi-final venues. With the final already earmarked for Dublin on May 24, organisers confirmed last night that Leinster, whose reward for finishing the pool stages with a 100% record is a home quarter-final against Biarritz, could play all their remaining games at Lansdowne Road because of the lack of alternative stadiums, if next week's draw falls their way. Home advantage may also be hard to overcome in the other two quarter-finals. Northampton go to Toulouse requiring greater forward solidity than in Belfast last Friday. Llanelli will fancy their chances against Perpignan at Stradey Park. Leinster v Biarritz Leicester v Munster Toulouse v Northampton Llanelli v Perpignan Ties to be played April 25-27"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
