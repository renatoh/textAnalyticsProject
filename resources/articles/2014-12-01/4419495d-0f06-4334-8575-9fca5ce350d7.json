The sheep was found in north Omaha on Sunday wearing a Christmas sweater and is being kept at the Nebraska Humane Society, according to the Omaha World-Herald. Elizabeth Hilpipre, of the humane society, told the paper she guessed that the mystery sheep had walked away from a live nativity scene, thus the sweater. \u201cSometimes people will put a sweater on the sheep after they\u2019ve been sheared but we don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case here,\u201d Hilpipre said. \u201cWe hope to get him back with his owner or find a good home.\u201d The sheep could be adopted as early as Thursday because of the shelter\u2019s rule that animals must be held for three days before going up for adoption. \u201cWe\u2019ve had sheep here before but never one in a sweater, so that\u2019s pretty unusual,\u201d Hilpipre told the Omaha World-Herald. A missing Shetland pony named Blossom was recently reunited with its nine-year-old owner in southern California after going missing during the Thanksgiving holiday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
