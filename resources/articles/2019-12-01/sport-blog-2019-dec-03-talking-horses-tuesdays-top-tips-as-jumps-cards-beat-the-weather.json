Every race at Royal Ascot will be worth at least \u00a395,000, while 16 of the 30 contests have had their prize money increased. The two races chosen for the most significant upgrades have been popular with owners and trainers from overseas in recent years. The fund for the Prince Of Wales\u2019s Stakes, in which the Japanese mare Deirdre was a runner this year, rises by a third, from \u00a3750,000, while the prize for the Diamond Jubilee Stakes, a Group One sprint on the final day of the meeting which has attracted runners from countries including Australia, the United States and Singapore, has almost doubled, from \u00a3600,000. The increases to Royal Ascot\u2019s prize money comes at a time when many tracks are either freezing or reducing their contributions following the introduction of stake limits on betting shop FOBT machines earlier this year. This is expected to lead to a reduction in the number of betting shops, and therefore to racing\u2019s income from betting shop media rights. \u201cThese two races, which historically appeal to international horsemen, have been selected first as being likely to produce increased income from overseas betting and associated media/data rights,\u201d Guy Henderson, Ascot\u2019s chief executive, said on Tuesday. \u201cEqually, there are so many six, and now seven-figure races staged around the world over these distances that we must be conscious of options open to our own locally-trained star horses. The UK LBO [betting shop] media rights landscape and levy picture remains very challenging, which makes it difficult to plan beyond 2020."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
