Jesse Eisenberg, reprising the nervy, sweat-stained angst of his performance in The Social Network, plays Vincent Zaleski. Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, cast entertainingly against type, is Vincent\u2019s socially awkward computer whiz cousin Anton. Vincent has a dream \u2013 to make millions by shaving milliseconds off the connection between the New York Stock Exchange and Kansas by laying a fibreoptic cable across the country. Anton is browbeaten into leaving his job working for stock-dealing sociopath Eva (Salma Hayek, having indecent amounts of fun with the role) in order to finesse the computer codes. A film about boring tunnels and crunching numbers has no right being this entertaining, although writer-director Kim Nguyen wisely throws wildcard plot devices like terminal disease and an FBI investigation into the mix to add to the jeopardy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
