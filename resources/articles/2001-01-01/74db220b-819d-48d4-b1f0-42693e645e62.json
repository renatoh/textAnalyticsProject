Millwall equalised twice before having Christophe Kinet sent off for violent conduct after 50 minutes, with County's Andy Hughes scoring twice on either side of Paul Ifill's goal. Paul Moody levelled but Gary Owers grabbed a last-gasp winner. County's manager Jocky Scott said: \"It's a great result for us. There's not many teams who are going to come here and win.\" With third-placed Walsall held 0-0 on a treacherous pitch at Oldham , and the play-off contenders Northampton battling out a 2-2 draw with their visitors Wycombe , Wigan closed to within two points of the top and triggered a big clear-out at the hapless Hatters. The Luton manager Lil Fuccillo, looking to cut the wage bill, confirmed that the former Arsenal defender Gavin McGowan will lead a six-player exodus from Kenilworth Road. \"He has been paid up until the new year. There is going to be an official announcement when other players will be going,\" said Fuccillo. Given all that, it was a bad time for Luton's goalkeeper to blunder. Mark Ovendale, bought for \u00a3350,000 at the start of the season, dropped a Lee Ashcroft cross to allow Stefan Bidstrup to score the killer goal on 54 minutes. Stoke beat their fellow play-off contenders Bristol City 1-0 with the manager's son Bjarni Gudjonsson earning their second win in four days with a late goal. Dad, the deceptively named Gudjon Thordarson, hailed his team's performance as \"our best 90 minutes at home for a long time\". Macclesfield's director of football Gil Prescott, taking the side to Scunthorpe today, expressed his sympathy for Peter Davenport, sacked on Saturday after refusing to work alongside Prescott. \"There's no good time to lose your job,\" he said. \"Dav's been unlucky.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
