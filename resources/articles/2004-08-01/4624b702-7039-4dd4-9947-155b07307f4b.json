The announcement pushed the share price up 2p to close at 35p, recovering a small proportion of the ground lost by last month's profit warning. Sygen has a new long-term agreement with Triumph Foods, a US firm that has around 550,000 breeding sows or 10% of the US pig breeding stock. At the moment it provides 50% to 60% of Triumph's sows, and this could increase to between 75% and 80% under the new five-year deal, Sygen finance director John Adams said. The number of pigs the company sells in the US could rise by between 5% and 10% in 2006, although the firm would not provide precise estimates of how its sales will be affected. Last month the company issued a profit warning, blaming the fact that its customers faced higher costs for feed and were therefore cutting their breeding stock. However, Mr Adams said yesterday that soya and corn production was at record highs, which should translate to lower feed costs and more breeding stock in the future. Away from the farm, the main market was caught in a two-way pull with the FTSE 100 index closing up a mere 7.4 points at 4362.6. Volume, however, was a pathetic 2bn shares - less than two-thirds of a normal day's activity. In the bond market gilts finished broadly flat as traders refused to believe that rather downbeat July retail sales figures showed any long-term reduction in consumer spending. The benchmark 10-year gilt stood at 100.45, yielding 4.949%. Retailing stocks were hit by poor July sales figures and a dire profit warning from second liner JJB Sports, down 32.75p at 183.75p, with Next down 19p at 1481p. But leisure stocks were boosted by positive noises from the analyst community. William Hill was the best blue chip performer as UBS upped its stance on the stock to buy from hold with a 600p target. The broker was also positive on Hilton Group, up 3p at 260.25p. Vague talk of a possible bid for ITV from a venture capital firm helped the broadcaster edge up 2.25p to 102.5p but Barclays lost 9.5p to 503.5p as hopes of a bid from Citigroup or another US financial firm faded and Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein moved its stance on the stock to hold from add. Elsewhere in the financial sector, Amvescap added 3.75p to 273.25 on hopes that it is close to doing a deal with US regulators which will bring to an end its involvement in an inquiry into trading abuses by mutual funds. Shares in BAE Systems were the day's worst performer in the FTSE 100, down 5.5p at 204.5p as its joint broker ABN Amro warned that half-year figures from the defence group in early September could show an increase in net debt. Away from the main index, the FTSE 250 gained 40.2 points to 5956.3 while the small cap index closed 9.9 points higher at 2440.6. Second line IT services and hardware group Dimension Data lurched upwards 1.75p to 26.5p on hopes that it could go the way of several other smaller IT firms over recent months and get taken over. Also helped by bid talk were shares in Goshawk Insurance Holdings, up 2.75p at 46.75p. Shares in Amec gained for the second consecutive day on hopes of a bid from a US suitor at 400p. The shares closed up 11p at 306p. But Trinity Mirror gave back some of its recent speculative gains closing down 15.5p at 643.5p. Inkjet business Xaar gained 3p to 91.5p on talk that recent trading has been good while Terrace Hill built up a gain of 2p to 31.5p as three of the property investment and development group's directors bought shares at 30p each. Elsewhere in the property market, shares in Property Fund Management, which specialises in industrial estates, jumped as the company admitted it is in discussions that may or may not lead to an offer. The news brought a rapid response from fellow investment group Teesland, flat at 67.5p, which admitted it has bought a 13.1% stake in the company - equivalent to 2.9m shares. Teesland went on to say that it is not the company to which Property Fund Management was alluding in its statement but it intends to contact management to set up its own set of talks. The prospect of a bidding war for Property Fund Management saw the stock close 45p higher at 148.5p. Elsewhere, shares in AIM-listed venture capital group Billam continued to climb - up 4p at 25.5p - after Wednesday's announcement that it is floating one of its investments. Irish oil exploration group Petroceltic International gushed 1p to 15.5p as it announced plans to drill in Luke Skywalker's back garden. Petroceltic, which also has prospects offshore Ireland and Italy, has signed up Great Wall Drilling Co to drill on its land in Tunisia at a cost believed to be under $3m. The site is close to the location used in the Star Wars films as the young jedi's home planet. Traders believe that the drilling programme - which is for one well with the option of a second - could take just a matter of weeks and the potential represented by the site in southern Tunisia is very significant. Finally, gemstone mining business Tanzanite is expected to debut at 42p this morning, valuing the business at about \u00a325m, following a placing orchestrated by Williams de Broe and believed to have been twice covered."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
