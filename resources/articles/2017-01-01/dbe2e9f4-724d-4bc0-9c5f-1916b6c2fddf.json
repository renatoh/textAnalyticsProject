The France international joined Everton for an initial \u00a320m rising to \u00a324m on Thursday having failed to secure a regular starting role at United. Schneiderlin admits he \u201cdidn\u2019t arrive in the best time in Manchester United\u2019s history\u201d with criticism arising from a style of play under Louis van Gaal that \u201cwasn\u2019t very attractive\u201d. Despite leaving Old Trafford on good terms, however, the 27-year-old is determined to overturn a nine-point deficit on his former club this season and eventually lead Everton into the Champions League. \u201cIt is an honour to have played for Manchester United and it is on my CV,\u201d Schneiderlin said. \u201cNow I just want to have big ambition with Everton and overtake Manchester United, that is my aim. I believe Everton can reach the Champions League because they buy some good players in the transfer market. They have good project and the team that is already here \u2013 Lukaku, Barkley, Coleman, Gueye, Baines \u2013 is very good already. I think this team can do it for sure. You see Leicester winning the Premier League last year so of course we can do the Champions League.\u201d The former Southampton midfielder played only 11 minutes of Premier League football under Mourinho over three brief substitute appearances but insisted he had no issues with the United manager. Schneiderlin explained: \u201cIt was his choice. He said he liked me as a player and as a person and that he had nothing to reproach me for but he had to make choices. He chose other ones than me and it is as simple as that. He liked me as a players and he wanted me to stay but he understood that I was frustrated.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
