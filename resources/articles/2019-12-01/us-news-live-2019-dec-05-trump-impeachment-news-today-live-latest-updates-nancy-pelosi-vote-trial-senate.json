Here are the top stories to keep in mind. Donald Trump asked the supreme court Thursday to void a subpoena from the House of Representatives seeking his financial records. The Trump administration has scrapped plans to scan travelers\u2019 faces as they enter and leave the United States. Bernie Sanders is now leading the polls in California. The House ethics committee has asked Republican representative Duncan Hunter to stop voting. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended a secret meeting with a group of wealthy Republican donors this week, stoking rumors he is eyeing a political run. That\u2019s all from me, thanks for reading. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended a secret meeting with a group of wealthy Republican donors this week, CNN reported on Friday, while he was in London for this week\u2019s NATO summit. The gathering, hosted by right-leaning foreign policy non-profit the Hamilton Society, took place in Pompeo\u2019s hotel, and was not on the official schedule for the week. From CNN: The news that he made time to meet with the donors after a busy day visiting with world leaders only serves to heighten speculation that Pompeo may be eyeing a run for the Senate in Kansas next year and as he has become further embroiled in the Ukraine impeachment inquiry. The House ethics committee has sent a letter to the Republican representative Duncan Hunter asking him to stop voting, following his guilty plea over the misuse of campaign funds: Senator Bernie Sanders has pulled ahead of Democratic frontrunners in California as the 2020 race for president marches on, polls showed on Thursday. Senator Elizabeth Warren and the former vice-president Joe Biden have lost ground in California in recent months, a new poll for the Los Angeles Times has found. From the report: That erosion has benefited Sen Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who narrowly tops the primary field, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind, who doubled his support since the September poll. California will have a state primary on 3 March 2020 \u2013 shortly after the Iowa Democratic caucuses the month before. In the meantime, the race remains \u201cunusually fluid\u201d, according to Mark DiCamillo, the director of the Berkeley IGS poll of voters. The Department of Homeland Security has abandoned plans to implement facial scans of anyone leaving and entering the US, it announced on Thursday. The Trump administration had proposed regulation that would require Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to photograph travelers, but changed plans after \u201cconsulting Congress and privacy experts\u201d, Reuters reported. \u201cThere are no current plans to require US citizens to provide photographs upon entry and exit from the United States. CBP intends to have the planned regulatory action regarding US citizens removed from the unified agenda next time it is published,\u201d the agency said. Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts credited public pressure with the decision, which he called \u201ca victory for every single American traveler who flies on a plane\u201d. Donald Trump asked the supreme court on Thursday to void a subpoena from the House of Representatives seeking his financial records, according to the Associated Press. The documents are shielded from being turned over while the supreme court justices consider whether to hear Trump\u2019s case. The justices are also considering a separate appeal from Trump that would require the same accounting firm, Mazars USA, to give his tax returns to the Manhattan district attorney. The court could say as early as mid-December whether it will hear and decide the cases by the end of June. A third case involving House subpoenas for Trump\u2019s records from New York banks is also headed for the supreme court. Hello readers! Kari Paul in San Francisco taking over the blog for the next few hours. Stay tuned for updates. That\u2019s it from me on the blog today. My west coast colleague Kari Paul will take over for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Nancy Pelosi announced that House Democratic leadership would move forward with drafting articles of impeachment against Trump, as the speaker argued the president\u2019s actions had left lawmakers with \u201cno choice\u201d but to impeach. Pelosi confronted a reporter who asked if she hated the president. \u201cI don\u2019t hate anyone,\u201d the House speaker said, citing her Catholic upbringing. \u201cSo don\u2019t mess with me when it comes to words like that,\u201d Pelosi told the reporter. Joe Biden shared a contentious exchange with an Iowa voter who pressed the former vice president on his age and his son\u2019s business activities in Ukraine. \u201cYou\u2019re a damn liar, man,\u201d Biden told the voter before challenging him to a push-up contest. Former secretary of state John Kerry endorsed Biden in the Democratic presidential primary, arguing the former veep has the \u201ccharacter\u201d and the \u201cability to persevere\u201d needed to defeat Trump. Another House Republican, Tom Graves of Georgia, announced he would not seek reelection next year. The lawmaker is the 21st House Republican to announce a departure, underscoring the party\u2019s lack of confidence in regaining control of the chamber next year. Kari will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. Representative Collin Peterson, one of two House Democrats to vote against the measure formalizing procedures for the impeachment inquiry, dodged a question about whether he intends to vote in favor of the forthcoming articles of impeachment, but his response indicates hesitation at the very least. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has pressed ahead with impeachment, saying: \u201cThe President leaves us no choice but to act \u2026 Our democracy is what is at stake.\u201d The stakes could not be higher: has the US constitution, the basis of US democracy, been violated by Donald Trump? If so, can both the constitution and the president survive? In a fractured, poisonous political climate, the Guardian will steer an independent, fact-based path through the impeachment hearings. The need for rigorous, robust reporting has never been greater. As 2020 approaches, we\u2019re asking our US readers to help us raise $1.5m by early January to support our journalism in the new year. We hope you\u2019ll consider making a year-end gift. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. Make a contribution. Congressman Jeff Van Drew, one of two House Democrats who voted against the measure formalizing procedures in the impeachment inquiry, warned that drafting articles of impeachment could backfire on the party. The Iowa town hall where Joe Biden shared a fiery exhange with a voter remained contentious after the former vice president concluded his remarks, with one attendee telling the orignal questioner to \u201cget out of here.\u201d The voter who confronted Biden offered a very colorful response. The House speaker and the committee chairs leading the impeachment inquiry are remaining tight-lipped about the specific articles of impeachment they will draft. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a significant milestone,\u201d Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, said of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement that Democratic leadership would move forward with drafting articles of impeachment. But the chairman offered no clarity about which specific articles would be pursued, saying only that there were discussions going on now to reach a decision on that. Congressman Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, is demanding that chairman Jerry Nadler hold a \u201cminority day of hearings\u201d before the House votes on articles of impeachment against Trump. \u201cConsidering the haste with which this sham impeachment has been conducted, it is imperative that you contact me or my office as soon as possible to consult on scheduling the requested minority hearing day,\u201d Collins wrote in his letter to Nadler. But if Democratic leadership does intend to introduce the articles of impeachment next week, it seems unlikely the judiciary committee would hold an additional hearing to meet the Republicans\u2019 demands. The panel\u2019s next hearing, which is scheduled for Monday, will allow the House intelligence committee to present the findings contained in its impeachment report. The Bloomberg terminal, the flagship product of Michael Bloomberg\u2019s company, directs users to its owner\u2019s campaign website -- a feature that does not apply to other Democratic presidential candidates. The Financial Times reports: Users of Bloomberg terminals are funnelled to the Bloomberg 2020 campaign website merely by writing: MIKE. ... A Bloomberg spokesperson said the \u2018MIKE\u2019 function had been in place since at least 1997, when it was used to promote Mr Bloomberg\u2019s autobiography Bloomberg by Bloomberg. Two decades later it advertised his book Climate of Hope. The website it currently links to has for years promoted Mr Bloomberg\u2019s personal and political projects before being converted to his campaign site. The website that users are directed to presents a slickly-produced video narrating Mr Bloomberg\u2019s journey from \u2018a middle-class kid who had to work his way through college\u2019 to a billionaire businessman and politician. It asks readers to register their details to join the campaign team, and contains news of policy announcements \u2014 as well as an online shop including $22 \u2018I like Mike Bloomberg\u2019 T-shirts. That report comes three days after Trump\u2019s reelection campaign said it would no longer credential Bloomberg News reporters for events because of the outlet\u2019s position on covering the Democratic primary. Bloomberg News\u2019 editor-in-chief has said the outlet will not investigate Bloomberg or any other Democratic presidential candidate but will continue to investigate the Trump administration, prompting allegations of a journalistic double standard from the president\u2019s allies. The unidentified man who pressed Joe Biden on Ukraine and his age during an Iowa town hall said he intended to back Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders in the caucuses, even though they are also in their 70\u2019s. House Democrats could introduce articles of impeachment against Trump as soon as next week, according to the Hill newspaper. The Hill reports: \u2018I expect articles will be introduced next week,\u2019 one of the Democratic sources said, adding that the Judiciary Committee could also begin marking up those articles next week as well. The trio of sources signaled that the accelerated timeline is part of an effort to wrap up the historic inquiry into Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine before Christmas. In doing so, however, Democrats don\u2019t want impeachment to be the last vote before heading into the religious holidays, preferring instead to end on a more bipartisan note like funding the government. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has pressed ahead with impeachment, saying: \u201cThe President leaves us no choice but to act \u2026 Our democracy is what is at stake.\u201d The stakes could not be higher: has the US constitution, the basis of US democracy, been violated by Donald Trump? If so, can both the constitution and the president survive? In a fractured, poisonous political climate, the Guardian will steer an independent, fact-based path through the impeachment hearings. The need for rigorous, robust reporting has never been greater. As 2020 approaches, we\u2019re asking our US readers to help us raise $1.5m by early January to support our journalism in the new year. We hope you\u2019ll consider making a year-end gift. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. During Joe Biden\u2019s contentious exchange with an Iowa voter at a town hall, the audience jeered when the man said the former vice president didn\u2019t \u201chave any more backbone than Trump.\u201d The man then said he did not intend to vote for Biden, to which the candidate replied, \u201cWell, I knew you weren\u2019t. You\u2019re too old to vote for me.\u201d (That was after the man had criticized Biden for his age, which prompted the former veep to challenge him to a push-up contest.) Republican strategists and conservative commentators jumped to criticize Joe Biden for saying, \u201clook, fat\u201d to address an Iowa voter who was criticizing the former vice president for his age and his son\u2019s business activities in Ukraine. From the rapid response director for the Republican national committee: But Biden\u2019s campaign claimed the presidential candidate was actually saying, \u201clook, fact\u201d to correct the voter\u2019s comments. (The moment is around the 2:30 mark in the below video.) Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Senate judiciary committee and a close ally of Trump\u2019s, is denying a GOP congressman\u2019s request to subpoena the phone records of Adam Schiff. \u201cI don\u2019t have any desire to subpoena Adam Schiff\u2019s phone records,\u201d Graham said of the House intelligence committee chairman. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do that. When members start subpoenaing each other as part of oversight, the whole system breaks down.\u201d The request came after Devin Nunes\u2019 name appeared in phone records contained in the intelligence committee\u2019s impeachment report, but it\u2019s worth noting the panel did not subpoena the congressman\u2019s phone records. His calls showed up in the records of Lev Parnas and Rudy Giuliani, whose information was subpoenaed. Regardless, Graham\u2019s comments could indicate the Senate judiciary committee will not seek Schiff\u2019s testimony, as Trump has called for. The White House has reportedly directed Republican senator Kevin Cramer to block an effort to pass a resolution formally recognizing the Armenian genocide a century ago, according to Axios. That would mark the third time the White House directed a senator to block the symbolic resolution, which is vehemently opposed by Turkey\u2019s authoritarian president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. In October the House voted to formally recognize the systematic killing of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians under the Ottoman Empire in 1915, modern-day Turkey, as genocide. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has pressed ahead with impeachment, saying: \u201cThe President leaves us no choice but to act \u2026 Our democracy is what is at stake.\u201d The stakes could not be higher: has the US constitution, the basis of US democracy, been violated by Donald Trump? If so, can both the constitution and the president survive? In a fractured, poisonous political climate, the Guardian will steer an independent, fact-based path through the impeachment hearings. The need for rigorous, robust reporting has never been greater. As 2020 approaches, we\u2019re asking our US readers to help us raise $1.5m by early January to support our journalism in the new year.

You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. Make a contribution. Bernie Sanders will join youth climate protesters planning sit-ins around the country tomorrow \u201cat the offices of establishment Democrats who have yet to back the Green New Deal,\u201d according to a press release from the Sunrise Movement. Friday marks a year from when the group protested in speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office in Washington D.C. with congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The young people are planning sit-ins in battleground states and congressional districts in Iowa, Michigan, Colorado, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, California, Louisiana, and Massachusetts. Sanders will join strikers in Des Moines. A voter at a town hall in Iowa pressed Joe Biden on his son\u2019s business activities in Ukraine, saying the former vice president had \u201csent\u201d Hunter Biden to the country to work with an energy company. \u201cYou\u2019re a damn liar, man,\u201d Biden told the man. The former vice president denied that he or his son engaged in any corrupt activity in Ukraine and told the voter to \u201cget your words straight.\u201d Biden also pushed back against the voter for questioning his age. \u201cI\u2019m not sedentary,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou want to check my shape man, let\u2019s do pushups together here, man. Let\u2019s run. Let\u2019s do whatever you want to do. Let\u2019s take an IQ test. Okay?\u201d This cheeky suggestion was met with applause from the audience. The White House has just released a statement slamming Nancy Pelosi after the House speaker announced Democratic leadership would move forward with articles of impeachment against Trump. \u201cAt this morning\u2019s press conference, Speaker Nancy Pelosi could have finally announced a vote on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that would immediately help America\u2019s farmers, ranchers, businesses, and workers; or outlined a plan to work with the President to lower prescription drug prices; or addressed our Nation\u2019s infrastructure,\u201d press secretary Stephanie Grisham said. \u201cInstead, Speaker Pelosi did exactly what she always does \u2013 ignore the needs of the American people and advance her selfish political desires.\u201d Ironically, the House speaker did also announce this morning, following her impeachment statement, that Democratic leadership was scheduling a vote on a bill meant to lower prescription drug prices. Grisham concluded the statement, \u201cSpeaker Pelosi\u2019s instruction to advance this impeachment process \u2013 one that has violated every precedent - moves this Country toward the most partisan and illegitimate subversion of the Constitution in our history.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Nancy Pelosi announced House Democratic leaders would move forward with articles of impeachment against Trump, but the speaker did not offer any clarity on what articles would be considered or when the matter would come up for a vote. Pelosi lashed out against a reporter who asked her if she hated the president, telling him she did not and resented the usage of the word \u201chate\u201d given her Catholic upbringing. \u201cSo don\u2019t mess with me when it comes to words like that,\u201d Pelosi said. Former secretary of state John Kerry announced he was endorsing Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Asked during his weekly press conference about whether it was okay for the president to ask a foreign country to investigate a political rival, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy dodged the question by claiming Democrats have been trying to impeach Trump since he took office. Some of the president\u2019s other Republican allies have responded to this oft-repeated question from reporters by arguing that the request was not inappropriate because Ukraine\u2019s military aid was ultimately released. Former secretary of state John Kerry has endorsed Joe Biden over two fellow Massachusetts Democrats running against him in the presidential primary, Elizabeth Warren and Deval Patrick. \u201cI like Elizabeth enormously. I worked very hard to help her win her seat. And I like Deval. I worked closely with him as governor,\u201d Kerry told the Washington Post. \u201cI just think Joe is the person for the moment.\u201d Biden is well ahead of his opponents in terms of major party endorsements, having already earned the backing of dozens of congressional Democrats. Nancy Pelosi just concluded a closed-door meeting with the six committee chairs who will offer recommendations on the articles of impeachment, but the House speaker dodged reporters\u2019 questions about what the leaders discussed. John Kerry, the former secretary of state under Barack Obama who won the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004, has announced he is endorsing Joe Biden in the 2020 primary race. \u201cI\u2019m not endorsing Joe because I\u2019ve known him a long time. I\u2019m endorsing him because I know him so well,\u201d Kerry told the Washington Post. \u201cThe world is broken. Our politics are broken. The country faces extraordinary challenges. \u201cAnd I believe very deeply that Joe Biden\u2019s character, his ability to persevere, his decency and the experiences that he brings to the table are critical to the moment. The world has to be put back together, the world that Donald Trump has smashed apart.\u201d Kerry specifically cited Trump\u2019s performance this week at the Nato summit in London as a reason why the country needed Biden. \u201cThe petulance and smallness and ridicule that he invited is very dangerous for all of us,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cAnd that just underscores the urgency of people recognizing the assets that Joe Biden brings to the table.\u201d The Biden campaign similarly criticized Trump for his performance at the Nato summit, releasing a new video featuring footage of world leaders seeming to laugh at the US president. The Biden video described Trump as \u201ca president the world is laughing at\u201d and concludes, \u201cWe need a leader the world respects.\u201d Another House Republican, Tom Graves of Georgia, said he will not seek reelection next year, becoming the 21st member of the GOP caucus to announce a departure. Graves, who serves as the top Republican on the House financial services committee and is considered a close ally of minority leader Kevin McCarthy, comes from a solidly red district that is unlikely to flip to Democratic control. But his announcement, combined with the 20 others like it, signal that Republicans are not confident about their chances of retaking the House in next year\u2019s elections. Trump said in a tweet that Nancy Pelosi had a \u201cnervous fit\u201d at her weekly press conference, when the House speaker angrily told a reporter she did not hate the president. Pelosi told Sinclair reporter James Rosen she did not hate Trump and resented his usage of the word, given her Catholic upbringing. The speaker said she continued to pray for the president, even though she disagreed with him on many issues. The president said he did not believe Pelosi, but when House minority leader Kevin McCarthy was asked about her comments, the Republican lawamker said, \u201cI\u2019ll take the speaker at her word.\u201d House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said at his weekly press conference that Nancy Pelosi had \u201cweakened this nation\u201d with her announcement of Democratic leadership moving forward with articles of impeachment. McCarthy added he was more confident than ever that, when a vote is held on the articles of impeachment, there will be bipartisan opposition to the measure. (Two House Democrats voted against the measure that formalized the procedures of the impeachment inquiry.) The state department\u2019s special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, just announced that the administration believes up to 1,000 people have been killed in the Iranian regime\u2019s crackdown on recent protests. Hook said the state department had reviewed footage of Iranian forces shooting protesters with machine guns and loading their bodies onto trucks. James Rosen, the Sinclair reporter who pressed Nancy Pelosi on whether she hated the president, has previously asked the House speaker similarly pointed questions about the impeachment inquiry. Capitol Hill reporters said Pelosi\u2019s fiery response was a rare show of emotion from the usually controlled speaker. The journalist who asked Nancy Pelosi whether Democrats \u201chate\u201d the president appears to be James Rosen from Sinclair Broadcast Group, which has been criticized for its partisan leanings and close ties to the White House. Lucia Graves reported on Sinclair\u2019s rise in 2017: Sinclair\u2019s size, rightwing politics and close connections to Donald Trump\u2019s White House are starting to attract attention. Democrats are wading in to the fray and demanding answers over Sinclair\u2019s close ties to the Trump administration, which, they say, could mean the group is getting preferential treatment. The New York Times refers to the group as a \u2018conservative giant\u2019 that, since the Bush presidency, has used its 173 television stations \u2018to advance a mostly right-leaning agenda\u2019. The Washington Post describes it as a \u2018company with a long history of favoring conservative causes and candidates on its stations\u2019 newscasts\u2019. House speaker Nancy Pelosi was walking away from her podium to end her weekly press conference when a reporter shouted a question about whether Democrats \u201chate\u201d the president. Pelosi quickly turned on her heel to address the reporter directly, angrily telling him that she did not hate the president and that she resented him for using the word. \u201cI don\u2019t hate anyone,\u201d the House speaker said, citing her Catholic upbringing. \u201cI still pray for the president,\u201d she added. Pelosi threw a number of insults Trump\u2019s way, calling the president a \u201ccoward\u201d on gun violence, among other things. But she emphasized she did not hate the president. \u201cSo don\u2019t mess with me when it comes to words like that,\u201d Pelosi told the reporter. And with that, she walked out. Echoing her comments from her statement earlier this morning, Nancy Pelosi argued Trump had made the impeachment inquiry necessary through his actions toward Ukraine. \u201cThe president gave us no choice,\u201d the House speaker said. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who is dividing the country on this. We\u2019re honoring our oaths of office.\u201d Nancy Pelosi dodged a reporter\u2019s question about what would be included in the articles of impeachment, instead referring the matter to the committee chairs leading the inquiry. Asked by a reporter whether there was an \u201caha\u201d moment when she decided to back impeachment, Nancy Pelosi said the decision has been slowly building for more than two years -- since the start of the Russia investigation. This is a noteworthy comment because some Republicans have argued the inquiry is moving far too quickly, an opinion echoed yesterday by a legal witness called by the House minority yesterday. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Ukraine; this is about Russia, who benefitted from the withholdding of that military assistance,\u201d Pelosi said. She then added her oft-repeated line about the investigation, \u201cAll roads lead to Putin.\u201d As Nancy Pelosi holds her weekly press conference, the House judiciary committee just announced it would conduct a hearing Monday to \u201cReceive Counsel Presentations of Evidence in the Impeachment Inquiry of President Donald Trump.\u201d The announcement comes two days after the House intelligence committee released its report on the impeachment inquiry, and the judiciary committee said Monday\u2019s hearing would give \u201cCounsels for the Majority and the Minority\u201d the chance to \u201cpresent for their respective Committees.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi has started her weekly press conference, where she will inevitably be asked about the timeline for members voting on articles of impeachment. The speaker began addressing reporters by asking if they had a good Thanksgiving. They said they had, and then Fox News reporter Chad Pergram asked, \u201cAre we going to have a good Christmas?\u201d The speaker laughed but did not reply. House speaker Nancy Pelosi just made her second big announcement of the morning: Democratic leadership is planning a vote next week on a bill meant to lower presciption drug prices. The bill, which is called the \u201cElijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act\u201d in honor of the late Democratic congressman who championed the cause, would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, among other things. The vote could bolster Democrats\u2019 argument that they are continuing to address their constituents\u2019 needs as they move forward with the impeachment inquiry, despite Trump\u2019s repeated claims to the contrary. It\u2019s worth noting that, contrary to Trump\u2019s claim about Democrats having \u201cgiven up\u201d on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, yesterday\u2019s hearing indicated the Russia investigation may factor into the articles of impeachment. Chairman Jerry Nadler mentioned Mueller\u2019s report in his opening statement during yesterday\u2019s hearing, and the special counsel\u2019s findings on how Trump obstructed the investigation could be factored into one of the forthcoming articles of impeachment. Trump has just weighed in on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement that House Democrats are moving forward with articles of impeachment, accusing the \u201cDo Nothing\u201d lawmakers of trying to impeach him over \u201ctwo totally appropriate (perfect) phone calls with the Ukrainian President.\u201d (Several Trump administration officials testified during last month\u2019s impeachment hearings that they were alarmed by the president\u2019s actions toward Ukraine as the country\u2019s military assistance was held up.) Echoing the legal expert who was called by House Republicans to testify at yesterday\u2019s impeachment hearing, Trump also warned the inquiry would set a dangerous precedent for future presidents. But Trump, who has called for a rapid House vote in order to advance to a Senate trial, remained confident he would \u201cwin\u201d the fight. It remains unlikely that the Senate will vote to remove the president from office, but Trump will probably lose his battle to have Hunter Biden or Adam Schiff testify during the trial. After delivering her statement on the impeachment inquiry, Nancy Pelosi reportedly offered a similar message to her Democratic caucus in a closed-door meeting. But the House speaker did not offer the members any further clarity on which articles of impeachment they would be debating or when the matter might come up for a vote. However, Democrats appear to be on schedule for a vote before Christmas. Congressman Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, accused chairman Jerry Nadler of being out of the loop after Nancy Pelosi announced Democrats are moving forward with articles of impeachment. Pelosi said in her statement that she would ask committee \u201cchairmen\u201d to move forward with articles of impeachment, so even if the judiciary committee takes the lead on it, other panels will likely weigh in. The president\u2019s reelection campaign issued a statement echoing Trump\u2019s request for a rapid House vote on impeachment in order to advance to a Senate trial, where the president and his allies expect Adam Schiff, Hunter Biden and Nancy Pelosi to testify. (But, again, the likelihood of that testimony occurring seems low.) The president\u2019s request for a rapid vote comes one day after a legal expert called by Republican members of the House judiciary committee argued the impeachment inquiry was already moving too quickly, as a New York Times reporter noted. Trump seems to be under the impression that a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate will allow him to call any witness he wants -- including Joe Biden -- but the actual likelihood of that seems ... quite low. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s use of the plural word \u201cchairmen\u201d to describe who will lead the next steps in the impeachment inquiry indicates multiple committees will be allowed to weigh in on which articles of impeachment will be drafted. The House intelligence committee held last month\u2019s public hearings with key fact witnesses in the Ukraine scandal, but the judiciary committee conducted yesterday\u2019s hearing with legal experts on the consititutional standard for impeachment. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said in her statement on the impeachment inquiry that she believed Trump represented a threat to the constitution and the country, citing yesterday\u2019s testimony from legal experts. \u201cOur democracy is what is at stake,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe president leaves us no choice but to act, because he is trying to corrupt, once again, the election for his own benefit.\u201d Pelosi continued, \u201cSadly but with confidence and humility, with allegiance to our founders and a heart full of love for America, today I am asking our chairman to proceed with articles of impeachment.\u201d The speaker went on to commend committee chairs\u2019 \u201csomber approach\u201d to the inquiry, which she argued was only made necessary by the president\u2019s actions. Nancy Pelosi and the House committee chairs leading the impeachment inquiry, particulalry Adam Schiff of the intelligence committee, repeatedly emphasized during the public hearings that they had not reached a determination on impeachment. The House speaker\u2019s announcement this morning signals that Democrats are now confident enough in the gathered evidence to move forward with a vote on impeachment, as had been widely expected. Nancy Pelosi has just announced that she is asking the committee chairs leading the impeachment inquiry to move forward with articles of impeachment against Trump. \u201cToday I am asking our chairmen to proceed with articles of impeachment,\u201d Pelosi said in her statement. But the House speaker did not specify a timeline for a vote on impeachment. In her statement on the impeachment inquiry, Nancy Pelosi outlined the allegations against Trump and argued the president abused his power. \u201cThe facts are uncontested,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe president abused his power for his own personal political benefit at the expense of our national security.\u201d Nancy Pelosi is now delivering her statement on the impeachment inquiry, kicking off with a history lesson on the Founders\u2019 desire to avoid a monarchy in America \u2013 echoing the legal experts who testified before the House judiciary committee yesterday. House speaker Nancy Pelosi should be delivering her statement on the impeachment inquiry any moment now, but C-SPAN is indicating we might still need to wait a bit. Good morning, live-blog readers! Nancy Pelosi is scheduled to deliver a statement on the impeachment inquiry at 9am ET, just a day after the House speaker held a closed-door meeting with her caucus during which Democrats reportedly signaled they are ready to advance toward a vote on impeachment. And Donald Trump has a request on that front. The president was tweeting this morning that he would prefer an accelerated timeline for a House impeachment vote, so that the matter can move on to the Senate, where he will likely be acquitted. \u201cI say, if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair ... trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business,\u201d Trump said. It\u2019s seeming increasingly likely that House Democrats will be able to stick to their schedule of holding a vote on impeachment by the end of the year, which means Trump\u2019s Christmas present could be the unfortunate honor of becoming the fourth US president to ever be impeached by the House. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will have a lunch with permanent representatives of the UN security council and later speak at both the National Christmas Tree lighting ceremony and a White House Christmas reception. Ivanka Trump will tour the Indiana Women\u2019s Prison in Indianapolis with Governor Eric Holcomb. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy will hold his weekly press conference at 11.30am ET. There\u2019s much more coming up, so stay tuned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
