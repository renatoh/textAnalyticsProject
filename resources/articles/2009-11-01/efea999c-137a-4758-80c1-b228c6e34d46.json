But it turns out that ol' Bob hasn't made it, owing to a heart attack; collective hearts sink further when Christiaan announces that each family member will get to sing. Jamie delivers Galveston (originally sung by Glen Campbell) in a voice so weird his father comments: \"That kid sure sings high.\" By the time the songs \u2013 including one about the music business, a subject as welcome as rickets \u2013 start collapsing halfway through, you wonder if it's time the elder Webb put his adult children over his knee. Instead, Jimmy rescues things with a quip: \"If you think that's embarrassing, you should have seen me stop the band on The Johnny Carson Show.\" He goes on to unveil his skill as a raconteur. Namedropping incorrigibly and culling from his \"drinking years\" with Richard Harris, he erases the memory of the earlier shambles with his riotous tales of \"pillaging\" Irish villages. In those days, he apparently suggested \"Let's make a record\" to everyone he met, from taxi drivers to Bill Clinton. Though no Glen Campbell, Jimmy's faltering vocals bring out the poignancy of songs others made famous. His sons \u2013 as well as Campbell's own son, Cal, on drums \u2013 back him on glorious renditions of Wichita Lineman and By the Time I Get to Phoenix, having presumably heeded their patient father's ominous jest about \"ruling the Travelodge with an iron fist\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
