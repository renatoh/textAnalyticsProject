I can do him proud'", "bodyText": "When Oliver Norburn stepped off the bench at Fratton Park in September, for the final minutes of the first game of the season, hardly anyone knew another battle was at play, anguish running through his veins. Three days earlier he rushed to the Royal Bolton hospital after his pregnant fiancee, Lucy, called in tears when a routine 20-week scan indicated difficulties. \u201cOn the way back [from Portsmouth] things were playing on my mind and I just wanted to get home,\u201d he says. \u201cWe went to see a specialist on the Monday and it was just awful news. Me and my missus had a little bit of time together and on the Thursday she had to give birth, which was tough.\u201d That day Norburn cradled baby Louie for the first and last time. For almost an hour he speaks with enormous strength, detailing an exhausting episode from an executive box overlooking the New Meadow pitch. There are tears and moments of silence, when only the groundsman\u2019s mowing can be heard, but Norburn\u2019s first answer, an attempt to unpack the past few weeks, is four minutes\u2019 long; he stresses the brilliance of the midwives on the ward, the ceaseless strength of his partner and wanting to fight on for Shrewsbury Town, as captain of the League One club. When his sentence ends, his lips quiver and his voice cracks. \u201cBetter out than in \u2026 [you\u2019re] one of the first people I\u2019ve cried to,\u201d he says, with the smallest of smiles. Norburn takes a swig of water, a few deep breaths and returns to why he was so desperate to throw himself back into football, having missed only one league match amid the unbearable sadness. \u201cI was planning to be involved on the Saturday \u2026 but it was too much, I don\u2019t think I could have done it,\u201d says the 28-year-old, who spent that weekend with Lucy, her mum, and Lilly, their three-year-old daughter, at a log cabin near Lytham, feeding the ducks and playing hide and seek. \u201cNormal daddy stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cSeeing the smile on her face makes everything feel that little bit easier. \u201cOn the Sunday I said: \u2018I want to go back to work, I want to crack on.\u2019 I played on the Tuesday night in an EFL [Trophy] game and since then I\u2019ve been back in and been involved. That night was really tough because I\u2019d say I was fighting through it more than ever but I knew if I got past that first hurdle in terms of playing, I knew how I would be. It\u2019s my release, it\u2019s my way out but there isn\u2019t a day that goes by where I don\u2019t think about him \u2026\u201d Norburn grabs a tissue and composes himself. Billy Sharp, whose newborn son, Luey, died in 2011, and Joe Riley, a former Shrewsbury teammate whose son, Leo Joseph, was stillborn two years ago, are among hundreds to have reached out in support. \u201cIt really is a pain you cannot imagine until you go through it. I\u2019ve seen these guys in the spotlight go through it but until you walk in those shoes, you can\u2019t begin to imagine it. \u201cI\u2019d say if anyone is going through a similar situation and finds it really difficult, it is best to speak and have memories. I spent the night with baby Louie, I\u2019ve got pictures and we\u2019ve got his ashes at home. I feel very grateful that the hospital and the ward let us spend the night with the little man. I think it is definitely best to speak about it. I\u2019ve never been the type of person to speak about problems before, I\u2019d bottle things up, so this is the toughest thing I\u2019ve been through in my life. I\u2019m going to try and use it in the future as a positive tool, thinking that my son is shining down on me and I can do him proud.\u201d Norburn inevitably has his moments, as he puts it, but he and Lucy have tried to shelter Lilly from some of the pain. \u201cYou don\u2019t want her to see you getting too emotional. It\u2019s something we speak about to Lilly, because she was expecting a brother or sister. She is aware of what has happened, not to what extent, but she knows baby Louie has gone to heaven and he\u2019s left her a teddy bear. He will be with us for ever.\u201d That trip to Portsmouth was, understandably, a bit of a blur. At the hotel he confided in Shaun Whalley, his roommate and a close friend. The day before they travelled, 24 hours after being told his son was suffering with severe brain and kidney problems, he went into the manager\u2019s office to inform Sam Ricketts the delicacy of the situation. \u201cI told him I didn\u2019t want anyone to know. He said: \u2018Listen, if you don\u2019t feel up to it, take your time,\u2019 and basically put everything in my court. He was top class. One of the lads asked me: \u2018How\u2019s your missus doing?\u2019 And I had to clench my teeth because I didn\u2019t want anyone to know.\u201d Norburn has started Shrewsbury\u2019s past six matches and, should the midfielder score against Burton on Tuesday, he has a celebration in mind. On his right wrist, he has added Louie\u2019s name, a cherub and angel wings to a tattoo sleeve also decorated with a poem in tribute to his grandfather. \u201cThat\u2019s my way of having him with me,\u201d Norburn says. \u201cI\u2019m hoping if I start scoring that\u2019s what I can kiss when I\u2019ve scored because he\u2019s always going to be there with me. I think about him all the time and the aim is just to do him proud.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
