He was still photographing the copper wire factory and its workers when it closed down \u2013 though, admittedly, he had been there for six years. He had originally gone to photograph the manager, but found he didn't want to leave. The place was entrancing \u2013 with its huge copper coils, corroded tools, baths of hydrochloric acid and borax, ancient cranes, rain pouring through slate roofs, wooden beams dating back to 1834, and two overhead heaters attempting to warm up a mill the size of a football pitch, the factory in Sandbach, Cheshire, seemed frozen in time. Coekin has spent much of his career investigating working-class life. He grew up in Leicester, the son of factory workers. At 15, he left school and got a job in a local cotton factory, fetching yarn for the spinners. Then he moved on to building sites. He dreamed of escape, and in his 20s went to university and did a degree in documentary communications. That's exactly what he wanted to do \u2013 to document and communicate with a camera. He was soon drawn back to the life he'd been so keen to escape \u2013 his first book, Knock Three Times, was about working men's clubs. Over time, Coekin's style has changed. Yes, he still documents, but it's no longer straight reportage. The photographs on these pages, say, are clearly staged: he wanted the workers in heroic poses, something akin to the workers featured in Russian constructivist art or the first painted trade union banners to emerge in 19th-century Britain. His style is strikingly original \u2013 there is something Rembrandt-like in the dark, subdued colours, and yet at the same time something distinctly unRembrandt-like in the exaggerated poses. He calls it hyper-realism. At this factory, John Pring &amp; Son Ltd, the workers draw copper wire into different thicknesses. It is tough, physical work, and can be dangerous. In the cleaning house, the acid is 98% proof and the borax is boiling. Workers should wear protective head gear, but Coekin wanted to take us back to an earlier pre-health and safety age. Before taking these photographs, he showed the workers images of old trade union banners. \"These banners are paintings accessed by the masses as opposed to painting by the art establishment. I wanted my pictures to be strong and bold. I wanted the workers to feel proud of what they were doing.\" When he started photographing the factory, there were 30-40 workers, but over time the numbers fell. Two years ago, it closed. Nick Baker, 35, worked in the cleaning house, and here he is photographed in white gloves holding the motor to the crane that will drop the copper coil into the bath. \"The coils can weigh up to two tonnes,\" Baker says, \"and I did get splashed a couple of times when they were dropped by crane into the acid. It burns quickly.\" He says there was an inevitability about the factory's closure. \"Things were bad because we were already working part-time \u2013 first one day off, then two and three.\" In 2009, things got desperate \u2013 local newspapers reported that workers went unpaid for two months, the site was temporarily shut down as bosses tried to refinance the company, then finally it shut for good. Baker had been laid off before, but says he knew it would be hard to find work this time. It took him months, but he's working again. He had served his apprenticeship as a machine operator and that's what he's back doing, though now it's all computerised. When he thinks about his four years at the factory, it's the camaraderie he remembers. It's amazing, he says, how you can work alongside people for five days a week for years, how you can be closer than family, then you're laid off and you might never see each other again. Coekin's photographs, which feature in a beautiful book called The Altogether, formed the centrepiece of an exhibition, shown in Wolverhampton and currently on show at the People's History Museum in Manchester. He has also produced a seven-inch vinyl single inspired by the slapping and thrashing of the machinery and the chatting of workers. Barry Haslegrabe, pictured here pulling rope over his shoulder, retired a year before the closure. The picture is inspired by an old trade union poster headlined Pull Your Weight. He started off as a lorry driver and ended up working at John Pring for more than 30 years. Despite a number of near misses, he was never hurt at work. \"The wire rope snapped once,\" he says. \"You had to be very wary. I never stood close to the coils. When two tonnes swing round, it's a lot of weight.\" He believes the place was doomed when it was taken over by Americans a few years before the closure. \"Things went into decline. We lost orders.\" Six months after retiring, Haslegrabe discovered he had cancer of the stomach. It's been a tough year, but he is fighting back. He still sees some of his old workmates. \"Quite a few have found work, but not doing what we were doing. That was the last big local wire firm.\" Coekin says that sometimes the workers thought what he was asking was daft. \"They would pull my leg. Sometimes I'd feel a bit embarrassed, a bit pretentious, but I am a serious artist \u2013 if I need to be pushy to get what I want, I am.\" Now the factory has closed, the workers are glad Coekin spent time with them. As Nick Baker says, without him a way of working would have vanished without being recorded. \"If Chris had not done it, no one else would have, and that bit of history would have been lost.\" \u2022 The Altogether is available from walkoutbooks.com at \u00a320."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
