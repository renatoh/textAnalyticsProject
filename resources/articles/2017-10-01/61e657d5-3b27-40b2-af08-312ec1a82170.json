On Thursday Bishop publicly congratulated Ardern, after New Zealand First leader Winston Peters chose to form government with Labour. In August it was revealed that New Zealand Labour MP Chris Hipkins had submitted questions about eligibility for New Zealand citizenship which assisted the Australian opposition to establish that the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, was a dual citizen and therefore potentially ineligible to sit in parliament. The revelation prompted the defence industry minister, Christopher Pyne, to accuse Labor of engaging in a \u201cconspiracy using a foreign government\u201d to bring down the Australian government. At the time Bishop noted that \u201cNew Zealand is facing an election\u201d and \u201cshould there be a change of government I would find it very hard to build trust with those involved in allegations designed to undermine the government of Australia\u201d. On Friday, Turnbull told 3AW he had congratulated Ardern on Thursday and would work constructively with her, as former Australian prime minister John Howard had done with the former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark. \u201cI have got no doubt we will work together effectively, confidentially and constructively as Australian and New Zealand prime ministers have done ... for generations,\u201d he said. \u201cI am certainly looking forward to doing that ... I do expect to trust them.\u201d Turnbull said Ardern had \u201cdeplored\u201d and regretted the \u201cpolitical activity in New Zealand\u201d when she discovered it. \u201cYou\u2019re better off not scratching away at past political episodes. I\u2019m looking forward to a great relationship with the new government. [Ardern] is committed [to the relationship], I had a very good discussion with her last night,\u201d he said. Asked if Bishop needed to apologise, Turnbull replied: \u201cNo. No.\u201d Speaking to radio in New Zealand, Ardern said she appreciated congratulations from Turnbull and Bill Shorten. \u201cThat is one of our most important relationships and that will continue under my leadership,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, I flagged last night I\u2019m very keen to make a trip to Australia as soon as I am able.\u201d At a press conference on Friday Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, said Bishop\u2019s behaviour was \u201cunwise\u201d as she had brought \u201cpartisan politics into our relationship with New Zealand\u201d. \u201cThe intemperate nature of her remarks has been demonstrated by the election of a New Zealand Labour government ... that she suggested that she would have difficulty in trusting.\u201d Wong called on Bishop to \u201cset about repairing the relationship\u201d. At a press conference in Perth on Friday, Bishop said the Australian government was \u201clooking forward to working with the new government because we have such a deep and strong and close connection\u201d with New Zealand. Bishop said Ardern had offered an explanation \u201csome months ago about the conduct of one of her colleagues whom I had criticised and she said [it] was wrong and inappropriate and should not have occurred and they should not have been involved, and I have accepted her explanation\u201d. Bishop said she was \u201cdelighted\u201d Ardern had offered an explanation and she had \u201cagreed entirely with her\u201d. \u201cI absolutely accept her explanation and I thank her for it and I\u2019m looking forward to working with the new government.\u201d Bishop denied that her comments had damaged the relationship between the two countries. She said she would contact the New Zealand foreign minister when appointed and looked forward to Ardern visiting Australia. In August, Ardern said she had not been aware that Hipkins had asked the citizenship questions and said he should never have done so. But Ardern also expressed disappointment with the accusations, and criticised Bishop\u2019s \u201cfalse claims\u201d. \u201cThere has been absolutely no collusion between the New Zealand Labour party and the Australian Labor party when it comes to the situation the Australian deputy prime minister has found himself in,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
