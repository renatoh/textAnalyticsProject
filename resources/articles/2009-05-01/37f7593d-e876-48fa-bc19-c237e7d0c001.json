Dominated by the vocals and keyboards of Sabina Sciubba and Didi Gutman of New York electro-dance exponents Brazilian Girls, and the guitar work of former Compass Point star Barry Reynolds, it's a brave, unexpected set that veers between the brilliant and the occasionally dreadful. When the mixture works, it works very well indeed - as on the title track, which is based around a brilliantly infectious hook and builds like a classic pop song. When it doesn't work, as with the embarrassing Cantaloupe, it sounds as if one of Africa's great voices is being swamped by technology and an over-simple western melody. Between those extremes, the album veers between the gently driving A Song for Women, the mildly annoying International (in which Sciubba intones a list of cities), the breezy and tuneful English-language pop tune Dakar Moon, and the gently exquisite Tindo Quando, which serves as a reminder of Maal's own sturdy guitar work. It's worth checking out - but be warned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
