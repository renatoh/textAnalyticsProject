The family's housing association landlord has been granted permission to repossess their home, and the Brightons, unable to pay the resulting court costs and outstanding rent totalling \u00a367,000, now face bankruptcy. The repossession order, approved last week in Manchester crown court, marks the complete breakdown of an increasingly acrimonious relationship between the family and the Guinness Northern Counties Housing Association \u2013 a relationship which started with the best of intentions. A hereditary condition causing the gradual crumbling of Mark's spine and hips has left him using wheelchair since 1997, and Angela is his full time carer. The family was offered a new property in Ashton-under-Lyne, near Manchester, designed and built to meet Paul's specific needs by the housing association on land given by Tameside metropolitan borough council. After some delays, including having to apply for a grant to install a lift to the main bedroom, the Brightons signed a tenancy agreement in April 1999 and moved in five months later. Most new properties have flaws \u2013 known in the building trade as snaggings \u2013 but the Brightons say those in their new home made life very difficult for Mark. They say the toilet in the upstairs wetroom was positioned in a corner next to a radiator, meaning his knees could easily be burned. The shower was too small for a chair to fit into. Tiles fell off and pipes leaked into the wall. A wooden covering over pipes leading to the downstairs toilet was crushed by Mark's wheelchair. The door to the toilet opened the wrong way, making it difficult to manoeuvre the wheelchair. The lift stuck. The housing association did its best to repair and make good, but nothing could get around the fact that the Brightons felt the rooms were small and the angles to the doors very tight. In a statement, Guinness Northern says: \"Their home was designed to full mobility standards and had further adaptations made to help meet Mr Brighton's needs.\" Angela says: \"The house was sold to us as a move for life, something that would make my husband's quality of life better. But accessing other rooms and the lift was all getting beyond him. He was spending most of his time upstairs. It got to the stage where we were bringing meals up to the bedroom and staying with Mark to keep him company.\" The final straw came in 2007, when the shower base collapsed on to the pipes below while Mark was washing. Workmen discovered the joists were rotten and the floor would have to be replaced. Guinness Northern agreed to pay for the Brightons to move into alternative accommodation for a couple of weeks until the work was complete. They moved to the disabled access room and an adjoining bedroom in a budget hotel near Manchester airport. Without clothes washing facilities or kitchen, this was not ideal. After four weeks the wetroom floor had been mended, but there were still bare pipes sticking out of the wall. In the meantime an engineer had declared the lift unfit for use, but parts were now unavailable so it needed replacing. The lift, it became apparent, was the Brightons' responsibility. Angela says: \"Because it had been bought and fitted with money from a grant in Mark's name, the housing association said it was our lift.\" Finding the \u00a38,500 it would cost was impossible for the Brightons, who are on housing benefit and disability living allowance. They refused to move back into the house until the repairs had been made; and the housing association stopped paying for their hotel. The stalemate has resulted in the Brightons living in two hotel rooms for nearly five years. During that time their two elder sons Mark and Phillip have gone through university, and their youngest, Terence, is now studying medicine. All three chose nearby universities so they could support their parents. The elder sons worked throughout their studies to top up the rent: the housing benefit they receive is \u00a3300 short every week. Because the family can only claim benefit for one property, rent for the house in Ashton has gone unpaid. Guinness Northern served notice on the family, and the Brightons launched a counter suit, saying the property was unsuitable for Mark, for whom the house had been intended. They qualified for legal aid, but the wrangling went on for so long the Legal Services Commission eventually refused further funding. So Angela was the family's sole representative in court when the housing association applied for permission to repossess the property. At the very last minute the family sought help from Citizens Advice, but it was too late: there were no advisers or even a duty solicitor in court on the day the hearing started. \"The barrister for the housing association asked us to settle before the case, in return for dropping the outstanding rent and costs, but I couldn't do that. We still want to be able to go home,\" says Angela. She was also afraid that by handing over the keys, the family would be deemed to be making itself deliberately homeless, meaning the local authority would have no responsibility for rehousing them. However, after a three-day hearing the court found against them. \"The judge said that because we had been living in the hotel for so long, and that was the address our housing benefit applied to, that it was our home now. \"I wish we had never been offered the house. It's been a nightmare, and we've been made to feel we're the awkward and ungrateful ones. Mark feels it's his fault that we are in this situation.\" Guinness Northern said it had done everything possible to resolve the Brightons' situation. \"However, every attempt we have made to satisfy them, including completely refitting their bathroom, offering them alternative accommodation and even offering to write off the rent arrears ha s been rejected. \"We reluctantly took action, having reached the unsustainable position where they had run up arrears of over \u00a318,000 on a property they had full possession of but refused to live in for five years. \"All of the evidence relating to [their] dispute with Guinness Northern was robustly and thoroughly examined in a three-day hearing. The case against them was proven and their counter claim was completely dismissed with costs awarded against them. \"At several points the judge advised them to settle (which GNC was willing even at this late stage, to do) \u2026 but they rejected his advice.\" The Brightons now have to tackle the issue of where they are going to live. Tameside council says: \"Our understanding is that the Brightons currently live in Manchester. They could potentially present themselves as homeless to either Manchester city council or ourselves. If they approached Tameside council on this basis we would make a decision as to whether we had any statutory duty to house them.\" The most remarkable thing about the whole sorry story is that the family has stuck together through thick and very thin. Paul Goggins MP, who tried unsuccessfully to mediate, says: \"These are just very normal people. What they have done shows extreme commitment and loyalty.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
