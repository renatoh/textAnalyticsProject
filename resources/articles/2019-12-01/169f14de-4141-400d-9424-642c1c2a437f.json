In October the employment and skills minister, Michaelia Cash, announced Cam\u2019s appointment to the role promoting vocational education, but refused to reveal his pay, arguing it was \u201ccommercial in confidence\u201d. On Thursday Nadine Williams, the deputy secretary for the skills and training group, revealed in spillover estimates that the value of Cam\u2019s contract is $260,000 in the first year and $85,000 in the second year, excluding GST. The government has previously described the role as a 15-month position. On Friday Scott Morrison defended Cam\u2019s pay, telling reporters in Canberra he made \u201cno apology for trying to get young people into trades\u201d. Morrison described Cam as \u201ca successful tradie\u201d who can make clear the message that there are \u201cwonderful economic opportunities\u201d for taking on a trade. \u201cWe made no secret about the fact he wasn\u2019t doing it as a volunteer. \u201cSo look, this is about getting young people into trades. And he\u2019s a high-profile person involved in the media industry, and you have to meet the market.\u201d The appointment prompted fury from Labor and the unions, who called on the Coalition to stop hiring \u201ccelebrities\u201d and properly fund Tafe and apprentices instead, claiming $3bn had been cut from vocational education since it came to office. However, as Cash noted in estimates on Thursday, Cam had been \u201cutilised by former Labor governments as well\u201d. In 2009 the Labor government paid $74,250 to SWC Contractors for \u201crepresentational services by Mr Scott Cam at Centrelink Job Expos\u201d, with a further $76,500 paid in 2011 to the same company. In October, Cash described Cam\u2019s role as \u201cto work with us to really get [the] message out\u201d about the value of vocational education, explaining she would be \u201cout and about with Scott attending high-profile events\u201d to do so. Cash described Cam as a \u201cformer apprentice around 40 years ago now\u201d and \u201cliterally a household name in Australia\u201d, citing the fact he ran his own business and had employed apprentices as qualifications for the role. Cam did a three-year carpentry apprenticeship at age 17 and has worked as a television presenter since 2000 when he first appeared on Backyard Blitz. He won a Gold Logie award in 2014 for hosting renovation reality television show The Block. On Thursday departmental officials also defended the appointment of the former Liberal staffer Adam Boyton to the $500,000-a-year job of interim national skills commissioner through a limited tender. Williams said that Boyton was appointed after an \u201copen merit-driven, competitive process\u201d due to the \u201ctechnical merit of his experience\u201d including as a member of the New South Wales government skills board and chief economist at the Business Council of Australia and Deutsche Bank in Australia. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The department received 24 applications after advertising for the position, interviewed nine candidates and put three forward for government consideration. Boyton was the department\u2019s preferred \u201cmerit recommendation\u201d, who was then appointed by cabinet at Cash\u2019s recommendation. The Austender contract notice states Boyton was appointed through a limited tender. According to procurement rules, limited tender allows the government to approach a particular supplier to apply and the regular rules of open tenders do not apply. Those rules include a 25-day period for applications, a guarantee of fairness and impartiality, and that submissions are treated in confidence. Boyton is a former policy director and chief of staff to the former NSW Liberal leader John Brogden. Cash told the estimates committee she did not know Boyton before the application process."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
