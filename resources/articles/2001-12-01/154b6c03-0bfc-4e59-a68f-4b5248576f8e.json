The eulogies at their demise may be premature but so are the acclamations of their return. A third successive victory will send shivers down the spines of the title pretenders but there were still as many spills to go with the thrills on Saturday. At times the home side's defence was as indefensible as ever. Better sides than Southampton would have found reward; as it was, against off-colour opponents, the Reds' shortcomings hardly mattered. Strachan would have been pained to admit as much. \"You could see a few of their lads looking at each other and thinking, 'This is it, we're back,'\" said the visiting manager, suppressing a shudder as he recalled how his team had been swamped by Ruud van Nistelrooy's first United hat-trick. \"We kept plugging away and creating chances but they were too good for us. They had a lighter step and there was a sparkle in their eyes again.\" By the end there was even a smile from the Silent One in the dug-out. Sir Alex's mind games had made their mark, with David Beckham and Ryan Giggs watching from the bench until emerging for second-half cameos. \"We worked all week anticipating playing against the two of them,\" said Strachan. \"We all got sucked in. We've been outplayed and out-thought.\" The visitors shared parity for 30 seconds before Paul Scholes' 50-yard pass was gathered by Van Nistelrooy who dispatched his shot in off a post. His second was scrappier, poked home after pin-ball in the area, but Van Nistelrooy was awesome throughout. The Dutchman's impact since joining in the summer may have been overshadowed by his team-mates' deficiencies at the other end but he looks worth every penny of the \u00a319m paid to PSV Eindhoven. The 25-year-old is strong, mobile and a feverish worker and has now scored 10 goals in 13 Premiership starts. \"You have to be mentally strong to play here,\" said Strachan, who played 208 times for United. \"Ruud's clearly got no problems in that respect. Mentally he's been tested with his injury and he's come back and played. \"He brought everybody into play today and our centre-backs just couldn't handle them. He was everywhere. Ordinary class players are happy to run around but that's what world-class players will do. Sometimes you have to hold your hands up; you can coach as much as you like, telling your players to push across or get stuck in, but when opponents are as good as that there's not much you can do.\" The striker's third came courtesy of another astute pass from Scholes. The Dutchman strode forward, approaching the box at an angle at which some forwards might blanch, and poked the ball into the corner. Behind Van Nistelrooy, United's midfield purred. Without Giggs and Beckham they lacked width but compensated with neat passing salvos which hypnotised their opponents. The Saints were happy just pinging a few neat triangles. United fizzed into space with elaborate pin-pointed hexagons and octagons; the turkeys of Southampton, bamboozled and bemused, were duly stuffed. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's volley from Nicky Butt's corner put them three up before the break. After Van Nistelrooy's third Beckham and Giggs combined to send Roy Keane skipping into acres of space to score a scintillating fifth. Phil Neville even indulged in some show-boating on the right touchline before picking up possession, running across the edge of the box and crashing an unstoppable sixth beyond the beleaguered Paul Jones. \"Each game we win sends out a little of a bit of a message, saying we've maybe just turned the corner,\" said the defender. \"We're slowly getting there. We won well but it wasn't vintage United; we were still sloppy at times.\" That slackness should have been punished, with Paul Telfer mistiming a header from Chris Marsden's centre and James Beattie, sent through by a Paul Williams punt, lobbing over when the visitors trailed by only one. But Southampton lacked conviction and instead found reward only when trailing to a quartet of home goals. Inevitably the reply owed much to slipshod defending as Fabien Barthez's clearance squirted off Juan Sebastian Veron and Telfer's cross was calmly converted by Marian Pahars. Barthez then denied Beattie's shot on the turn and late header - blundering then brilliant normal service, United-style."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
