Testifying before Senate committee on the topic of whether to authorize military force against jihadis \u2013 more than eight months after air strikes and military operations against Isis began \u2013 Carter conceded that the authorization\u2019s language would allow \u201cflexibility\u201d to include targets who have affiliated with Isis and threaten the US or its many coalition partners. \u201cThis AUMF [Authorization for Use of Military Force] could apply to operations in and around Libya,\u201d Carter said, \u201cdepending on whether or not they met the criteria\u201d of allegiance to and coordinating with Isis to attack the US or one of its partners. The hearing came as a Iraqi government forces and Shia militias advanced towards the centre of Tikrit in the largest operation against Isis since its lightning it conquered large areas of the country in a lightning offensive last summer. The assault on Tikrit has been backed by Iran, but the US-led coalition has not been invited to participate with air strikes. Senators on the senate foreign relations committee all expressed their support for the authorization, but the hearing raised many looming questions of US strategy in Iraq and Syria without easy answers for Carter, secretary of state John Kerry, and general Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. Kerry tried to downplay the suggestion that an already open-ended conflict could take on yet more dimensions. \u201cAs of now in its current state, merely by pledging or flying the flag,\u201d Kerry said, \u201cthere\u2019s no decision made or even contemplated that [Boko Haram] would be covered.\u201d Regarding Iraq, senators voiced fears that neighboring Iran will wield growing influence as it arms and trains Shia militias to fight the Sunni jihadists. Dempsey said that while the US is concerned with many Iranian activities, \u201ctheir support of the Iraqi forces is a positive thing in military terms\u201d against Isis. The three witnesses at times sharply rebutted senators\u2019 attempts to stir up anti-Iranian statements, with Kerry defying Rubio\u2019s claim that Iranians do not want US military action in Iraq against Isis. \u201cThe facts completely contradict that,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cThey would welcome our bombing.\u201d \u201cBut we are all concerned about what happens after the drums stop beating and Isil is defeated,\u201d Dempsey said, in particular worrying whether Shia militias \u201cwhen they recapture lost territory, whether they engage in acts of retribution and ethnic cleansing\u201d against Sunnis trying to return home or having survived Isis\u2019s occupation. \u2018They\u2019re gonna run Isil out of Tikrit\u2019 The offensive to retake Tikrit \u201cwill be a strategic inflection point one way or another in terms of increasing our concerns or decreasing them\u201d, Dempsey said, noting that Iran could either help Iraq economically or destabilize it through many means. He estimated there are about 1,000 tribal Sunni forces, approximately 3,000 Iraqi troops, a \u201ccouple hundred\u201d Iraq counter-terrorist personnel, and around 20,000 members of Shia militia trained and armed by Iran. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna run Isil out of Tikrit,\u201d Dempsey said. \u201cThe question is what comes after.\u201d There are also questions about training forces to fight both Isis and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, including about an \u201cAssad component\u201d of the authorization that might widen it to better defend Syrian rebels. Carter said that the administration is discussing whether and how how it can offer rebels protection, admitting \u201cwe\u2019re not going to be able to recruit men into that force unless we agree to support them on some level.\u201d \u201cIn the meantime we\u2019re attacking Isil where we can,\u201d he said, using another acronym for Islamic State. The stark questions of recruiting, training and objectives for Syrian rebels has drawn comparisons by Council on Foreign Relations fellow Micah Zenko to the US-orchestrated \u2013 and doomed \u2013 Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. Pressed about the Obama administration\u2019s vague strategy in Syria, Kerry said: \u201cWe are committed to other activities that are specifically focused on the Assad regime,\u201d but refused to describe those \u201cactivities\u201d outside a classified setting. Kerry said the training program for Syrian rebels, for which Congress has approved $500m, is \u201cabout to be up and running\u201d. \u2018Not contemplating years, not even months\u2019 of war The senators also demanded clearer explanations about the objectives and end scenarios of the conflict, no details of which were forthcoming from the witnesses. Carter said \u201cI respect the desire to have a sunset clause\u201d \u2013 meaning a set of terms that would bring an end to the authorization \u2013 but insisted \u201cthere is no foreseeing in my judgement how long it will take to defeat Isil\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not contemplating years, not even months to my knowledge,\u201d he said. The limitations on the use of force, Carter and Dempsey said, would be by prioritizing \u201cenabling\u201d partners over direct action. Isis would be defeated \u201cnot simply by cutting off its head, it\u2019s actually got to be rejected from within\u201d, Dempsey said. All three rejected the suggestion of large numbers of American soldiers on the ground, while allowing they wanted special forces to be brought into action if necessary, \u201cperhaps [for] a specific targeted operation against Daesh [Isis] leadership\u201d, as Carter suggested. \u201cThe limiting principle is the way this particular enemy will be defeated, it won\u2019t be defeated by US military power alone,\u201d Dempsey said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
