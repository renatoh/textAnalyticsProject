Don't read on if you haven't seen episodes one and two \u2013 and if you've seen more of the series, please be aware that many UK viewers will not have done \u2026 Richard Vine: the vital questions season six must answer \"Looks like we've made it.\" Rose. Boone! Charlie! Des on the plane! MIB is the SMOKE MONSTER!!! \"Hello Hugo\"! A Dharma shark!!! Caught your breath yet? The LAX double bill has got to be one of the most jam-packed episodes Lost has pulled off so far \u2013 jumping between two alternate time/space continuums (more on that later), reintroducing some of the cast they've killed off along the way, ramping up the mythology and establishing the next game-changing move. All this whilst ripping instantly into a heavy dose of the bloodstained romance and gut-pulling emotion they've perfected along the way. In some ways, having them start over again on Oceanic 815 might have been an obvious place to jump back in - but that didn't make it any less enjoyable. Jack replays his flirty conversation with the air stewardess (\"not a very strong drink\"), Rose leans in to comfort him when the plane starts bouncing around \u2013 and then the turbulence passes, and instead of crashing on the island, it's all just \u2026 OK. (If you want to remind yourself how it played out the first time, here's a handy side-by-side comparison.) Well, of course, that's \"OK\" in a non-crashy kind of way. Getting to see what might have happened (and now has?) was a reminder of how far we've seen some of the characters grow, and how much they've gained from the experience of the crash. Sun's reunited with Jin \u2013 but he's a chauvinist pig; Charlie's alive \u2013 but he's a degenerate rock star having a near-death experience with a bag of smack in a plane loo; Boone's alone on the plane having failed to convince Shannon to leave Australia with him; Rose and Bernard are blissfully together, but we know she's still got cancer; Locke's in his wheelchair. Only Hurley seems kind of happy (\"I'm the luckiest guy in the world!\"), running his own fried chicken empire called Mr Cluck's. With that massive revelation about the smoke monster so early on in the final series, it feels like we are actually going to be getting some answers from here on in. When the Man In Black Who Isn't Locke But Really Looks A Lot Like Him \u2013 next job: can we have a name for him ASAP please?! MIBWILBRLALLH isn't that catchy \u2013 revealed himself to be Smokey in front of Ben, it felt like the show was starting to finally unlock (un-Locke?) some of its mysteries. Alright, it did make give him a slight whiff of Nosferatu \u2013 and we've got enough vampires on TV right now, thanks very much \u2013 but it was a great scene. Simple, brutal in its execution, and a hint towards things to come, with Ben also learning that there's a way to fend him off. (Quick! Draw a black circle around yourself in, um, black chalk?) Yes, even when he's in the middle of a shootout, inside an ancient Egyptian temple watching a smoke monster on the rampage, Ben manages to come away with something useful \u2026 Talk about right place, right time. Speaking of time, it looks like we're still jumping around for the next few episodes at least. If the undercover Dharma crew (Jack, Sawyer, Hurley, Miles, Juliet, Sayid and Kate) have ended up back at the moment when the Swan Station hatch blew up, does that mean we're now watching two alternative timelines play out, about a month apart? We've got them all dealing with blowing up Jughead, losing Juliet and running into another set of Others in 2007 \u2013 and a whole parallel universe in 2004 where Oceanic 815 lands safely. We've had flashbacks, flashforwards \u2013 and now apparently, we're watching them \"flash-sideways\"! There were some great touches in the plane and the airport afterwards \u2013 it really feels like we've got to that stage in Lost where we're happy to just watch them bump into each other, oblivious to the lives that we've been watching them lead in the other universe/timeline/whatever it's going to turn out to be. Sawyer - meet Kate! Kate \u2013 meet Claire! Boone \u2013 meet Locke! Locke \u2013 meet Jack! Jack \u2013 meet Des! Des \u2013 vanish into thin air! The second half was no less exciting. It was great to see Hurley stepping out of his dudedom, after meeting Jacob's ghost, and steering the group towards the Temple (of doom? It all felt very Indiana Jones once we got there). The showdown with Richard, Ben and Evil Locke was a classic Lost powerplay, politics shifting over sand with a dead Locke spilled ungraciously out of his coffin on the beach, while the live other Locke walked past him. Join us here for next week's Kate-centric episode, and in the mean time, let us know what you think of the flash-sideways, Mr Cluck's, Juliet's final words and that shark. Locke's Miscellany and other Lost thoughts Where have we left them? Kate's in a cab with Claire. Juliet's dead. How did Desmond get on (and off!) the plane? When Jack said he felt like he'd met him before, was he referring to the time when they were out jogging, or to some sense of deja vu about their \"flash-sideways\" life? The Oceanic stewardess who served Jack on the plane has joined the Others. Sawyer, Kate, Hurley, Miles, Jin and Sayid are all in a temple with Dogen, a Japanese tough-guy who appears to be the new leader of the Others. I See Dead People We've been promised that we'd be getting another chance to see lots of the deceased members of Lost again this season, and this opener was like an episode of Most Haunted: Boone, Charlie and the US marshal who was escorting Kate back from Sydney were all back. Numbers Watch Did anyone catch sight of any of the numbers in play this week? The Faith v Reason-o-meter Jack's faith in his plan doesn't seem to have worked out for him on the island \u2013 but maybe it has in the new Oceanic 815-gets-to-LAX timeline? Jacob hasn't let a little thing like death get in his way either, and Hurley's decision to listen to Jacob's ghost paid off once Sayid came panting back to life \u2013 so maybe it's a win for faith this week? Polar bear count Zero, but there was a shark. What do we know so far? The Man In Black is the smoke monster! Where does it look like we're going? The Ankh (the \"key of life\") in Hurley's guitar case and the statue of Tawaret (\"the goddess of childbirth and fertility\") all point to some kind of Egyptian life and death theme. Does it all tie in with the Dharma Initiative's fertility experiments, and the Others' interest in baby Aaron? The Man In Black's big plan has finally been revealed too \u2013 he wants to get off the island \u2013 ironic, as Locke was the only one who wanted to stay \u2026 But how can Jacob leave if he can't? Best lines of the week \"Hello Hugo, you got a minute?\" Jacob may have just died \"an hour ago\", but he's still keeping it pretty calm. \"James, kiss me.\" \"You got it, blondie.\" Even with his dying lover covered in blood in his arms, Sawyer manages to pull out another nickname. \"I'm sorry you had to see me like that.\" Locke/Man In Black to a very shaky-looking Ben. \"John wants to talk to me?\" Richard calls Ben's bluff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
