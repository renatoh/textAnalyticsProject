Parents are facing fines of up to \u00a3100 under the Government's new truancy rules if they take their children out of classes to go away, even though family travel during the official school holidays can be vastly more expensive than in term time. An analysis today by Escape, The Observer's travel section, shows that a family of four could pay up to \u00a31,948 more for a week's skiing in the February half-term than in an off-peak week in January. Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, said Ministers should investigate if the crackdown on truancy was skewing holiday costs. 'If public policy says school holidays should be when they are, and public policy says parents should be discouraged from taking children away from school for holidays, then perhaps public policy is artificially creating a situation which the travel industry might then exploit,' Bruce said. 'I don't see why the Office of Fair Trading should not investigate how these prices can be justified. It's unfair because it penalises families and encourages what the Government is calling truancy and some parents regard as unauthorised absences. 'There is some obligation on the Government if they are being, not unreasonably, so strong on the policy that they should take action to try and ensure that parents are not disadvantaged.' Tour operators insist they are not exploiting holidaymakers, and say prices must rise during peak seasons to spread firms' costs throughout the year and sustain them in times of low demand. They say desirable destinations attract premium rates during the school summer holidays. Martin Garland, of the Association of Independent Tour Operators, said prices were fair. 'They take into account the huge annual investment involved; producing and dispatching brochures free to thousands of consumers; owning holiday accommodation for 52 weeks while letting it for, say, only 20; and paying suppliers in advance for the season.' However, some headteachers say parents, particularly those on tight budgets, are being put under heavy pressure by the high prices. A Department of Trade and Industry spokesman said it had no plans to intervene. 'The only way we would get involved is if there was evidence of price fixing, in which case the Office of Fair Trading would become involved,' he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
