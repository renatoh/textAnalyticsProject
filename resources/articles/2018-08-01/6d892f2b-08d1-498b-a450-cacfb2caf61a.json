Researchers from Historic England and McMaster University in Canada examined 2,787 skeletons from 18 cemeteries across the Roman empire and discovered that rickets was a widespread phenomenon 2,000 years ago. Rickets is caused by vitamin D deficiency, often because of a lack of exposure to sunshine. It was a particular problem in the crowded, polluted towns and cities of 19th-century Britain and is often assumed to be a Victorian disease. \u201cThis is something that prompted us to look at the Roman period,\u201d said Simon Mays, a human skeletal biologist at Historic England. \u201cIn Victorian times we normally associate it with the rise of urban living, and of course the Roman empire saw the first widespread urbanisation in Europe. Might we find it there as well?\u201d During the three-year project, researchers examined skeletons from northern England to southern Spain, looking for the deformities generally seen in rickets. Evidence for rickets was found in more than one in 20 children, with most cases in infants. \u201cThe big surprise to me was how young most of the sufferers were,\u201d said Mays. \u201cSome were suffering even in the first few months of life. The inescapable conclusion was that people were keeping their infants indoors too much.\u201d Quite why mothers might have been staying inside with their children is open for debate. \u201cOne tends to assume most women would have gone out and worked in agriculture: this throws open the possibility that that did not happen.\u201d The research reveals that Britain had the most rickets, presumably because of the cloudy skies and rainy climate. Unlike in Victorian times, Roman-period rickets was less common in towns than in cities, apart from one place: Ostia in Italy, a port on the Tiber, which was densely populated with many people living in the equivalent of multi-storey apartment buildings. Megan Brickley, of McMaster University, the principal investigator on the project, said: \u201cLiving in apartments with small windows, in blocks that were closely spaced around courtyards and narrow streets, may have meant that many children weren\u2019t exposed to enough sunlight to prevent vitamin D deficiency.\u201d The research, published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, shows that vitamin D deficiency is far from being a new problem. But it also has pointers for how we should live today. Mays said: \u201cIt shows how important getting out in to the sunshine is. We tend to be a little nervous of getting kids exposed because of the risk of skin cancer and quite rightly so \u2026 but this shows you can take sunlight avoidance too far and I think that was happening in Roman times and they were paying the penalty in cases of rickets.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
