The commerce department said on Thursday that the US expanded at an annual rate of 2.2% in the last three months of the year, down from an initial estimate of 2.6% and below the 3.4% growth achieved in the previous three months. The figure is well below the 5% growth rate that Donald Trump recently forecast and comes as evidence is mounting of a slowdown in other major markets including the eurozone and China. Analysts have forecast that the situation is likely to worsen following a slew of weak economic indicators, including figures from the European commission showing eurozone economic confidence slumped last month to its lowest level since 2016. Earlier this month the US Federal Reserve indicated that the slowing US and global economy meant it was unlikely to raise interest rates until next year at the earliest. Goodnight! GW Trouble\u2019s brewing at Royal Bank of Scotland, over CEO Ross McEwan\u2019s pension -- which looks a lot more lucrative than the package available to less senior staff. Traders are bracing for the pound to become more volatile.... Here\u2019s our news story about British businesses losing what little patience they\u2019ve got left with our political masters: The pound is continuing to lose ground tonight, now down one and a half cents at $1.3044. Traders have noticed a big political row kicking off in Westminster, over the government\u2019s plan to only vote on the Brexit withdrawal agreement, not the political declaration laying out the post-Brexit strategy. Labour are opposing the move, which appears designed to ensure Britain can leave the EU on 22 May. The DUP - whose support would be crucial for Theresa May - are also not swayed. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, Chief Economist and Head of Currency Strategy at WorldFirst, says investors are struggling to value the pound in the current mess: \u201cHow can a currency accurately price the risk of both a no-deal and a revocation of Article 50? It is not the job of the pound to be optimistic and hence, following the DUP\u2019s announcement last night that they cannot back the deal as it stands, GBP strength continues to slip away. \u201cWhether the next step in the Brexit soap opera is a General Election, a Tory leadership challenge, a customs union, a long extension or all of them together, GBP is stuck waiting for a sign, full in the knowledge that there is almost no room for error. We could end tomorrow with a deal or we could end it in No Man\u2019s Land, ready for indicative votes and confidence motions. \u201cMarch 29th was meant to be the day we leave the EU but will likely be the day where we realise just how few options we have. Here\u2019s Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics on the downgrade to US growth last quarter: The downward revision to Q4 GDP \u2013 which is now estimated to have expanded by 2.2% annualised rather than 2.6% \u2013 was mainly driven by weaker gains in consumption and business investment, underlining that domestic demand lost some momentum at the end of last year. We expect the personal income and spending data due on Friday to show that the economic slowdown continued into 2019, with a rebound in real spending in January unlikely to prevent consumption growth from slowing further over the first quarter as a whole. Newsflash: German lightbulb maker Osram has issued a profits warning, adding to concerns that the global economy is slowing. The Munich-based firm blamed the slowdown in the auto industry, which has hit demand for its car bulbs, adding: \u201cThis has led to significant inventory build ups, particularly in China. In addition, business development is facing an ongoing impact by the general economic slowdown.\u201d Shares in Osram have slumped by 10% in late trading, with carmakers\u2019 shares also weakening. Back at the BCC\u2019s annual conference, Legal &amp; General CEO Nigel Wilson has declared he\u2019s ready for Brexit.... whatever form it takes. Wilson says; \u201cWe invest for the long term, Brexit is a noise on that very long journey. It\u2019s not throwing us off course in any way whatsoever.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve stressed everything so don\u2019t worry. The one thing we\u2019ve learnt from the financial crisis is how to stress things.\u201d But he\u2019s not so confident about some other companies, particularly smaller firms... \u201cA lot of other people have had to work on their no-deal plans. Hopefully they\u2019ll never come around. But you feel very sad for business that haven\u2019t got the scale to prepare for it.\u201d Brexit jitters are pushing sterling lower this afternoon, as the government prepares to hold another Brexit vote on Friday. The pound has lost almost a cent against the US dollar, to below $1.31 for the first time since last Friday. It\u2019s not clear what MPs will vote on tomorrow, but apparently it won\u2019t be the much-anticipated Third Meaningful Vote. It\u2019s possible that Theresa May might try removing the Political Declaration section of the deal, in the hope of persuading House of Commons speaker John Bercow to allow a third run at victory. Paul O\u2019Connor, head of Janus Henderson\u2019s UK-based Multi-Asset Team, says the ongoing impasse has left MPs gridlocked: The clock is ticking and the pressure is building. If Parliament cannot establish support for either Theresa May\u2019s plan or one of the other Brexit options in the days ahead, then the UK will need to request an extended delay to the Brexit process to avoid the alternative \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit on April 12. Before granting a longer extension, the EU is likely to demand that the UK can identify some way of breaking the deadlock. A general election is a growing possibility here, although it is far from obvious why this will be an effective solution given how polarised and entrenched political opinion on Brexit is in the UK. As the eight votes showed last night, it is not hard to get agreement on rejecting options for Brexit but establishing consensus for a way forward remains elusive.\u201d In better news, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit fell last week, by 5,000. Market analyst Fiona Cincotta of City Index says this is helping markets to recover: The mood was positive across the board on Thursday with global shares climbing higher. A rebound in treasury yields, progress in US \u2013 Sino trade talks and better than forecast jobless claims have boosted sentiment, increasing demand for riskier assets. However a downward revision to US economic growth is keeping gains capped. US jobless claims fell to their lowest level in 2 months last week. This offered traders some reassurances as to the health of the US labour market after February\u2019s surprisingly weak jobs report. The news lifted spirits grabbing attention away from disappointing US GDP data. Andy Bruce of Reuters makes a good point about today\u2019s consumer confidence stats --- Britons are gloomier, but it\u2019s not hit spending. Stock markets in Europe and America are shaking off today\u2019s weak economic news, with some investors pinning their hopes on a breakthrough in the US-China trade talks. Mike Loewengart, vice president for investment strategy at E-Trade Financial Corp, says traders should heed today\u2019s downgraded US growth report: He says (via Marketwatch): \u201cGlobal growth is stagnating both at home and abroad, and this kind of GDP read may flash as a warning signal to market watchers that there is more turbulence ahead,\u201d \u201cSome may see this as a data point confirming their worries that we are headed to the end of the business cycle, especially after the inverted yield curve news last week.\u201d \u201cThat said, there are a fair amount of positive indicators out there\u2014strong jobs numbers, an uptick in wages, and a solid earnings season\u2014to pump some confidence back into the market.\u201d Another slowdown signal: fewer Americans bought houses last month. The National Association of Realtors reports that homebuyers signed 1% fewer contracts to buy existing homes in February compared with January. On an annual basis, these pending home sales have fallen by almost 5%. As you can see, there was a surge in pending home sales in January - but the longer-term trend looks weak. Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors, says: \u201cIn January, pending contracts were up close to 5 percent, so this month\u2019s 1 percent drop is not a significant concern. As a whole, these numbers indicate that a cyclical low in sales is in the past, but activity is not matching the frenzied pace of last spring.\u201d Financial analyst Paul Sommerville thinks America\u2019s economy is underperforming, given the boost from Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts: This financial analysts also fears the US economy is slowing: Today\u2019s GDP report further muddies the water about whether Donald Trump achieved his target of 3% growth last year, or not. The Commerce Department estimates that GDP rose by 2.9% in 2018, just shy of Trump\u2019s 3% target. However, it also reckons GDP was 3% higher in Q4 than in Q4 2017 -- which the president could chalk up as a win. Either way, if the economy does keep slowing, Trump will take some blame. The New York Times says: Economic data suggests that slowdown is already underway in the first quarter. Manufacturing is losing some of its steam from last year\u2019s rapid growth, and job creation is also moderating. Chief executives of some of the nation\u2019s biggest companies see investment, hiring and sales growth all slowing this year. Three-quarters of business economists say they are more worried about growth undershooting their forecasts than overshooting it, and half have revised those forecasts downward for this year. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to the US GDP report. Marketwatch\u2019s Jeffry Bartash highlights why growth has been revised lower: Guy LeBas of Janney Capital Management argues we shouldn\u2019t panic about it: Newsflash: America\u2019s economy grew more slowly than previously thought in the last three months of 2018. Newly revised data shows that US GDP only expanded at an annualised rate of 2.2% in October-December. That\u2019s down from a previous estimate of 2.6%, and slower than the 3.4% annualised growth recorded in the third quarter of 2018. That\u2019s the equivalent of a quarter-on-quarter growth rate of 0.55% -- still faster than the UK or the eurozone, which both only expanded by 0.2% in Q4. The Commerce Department revised down its earlier estimate after concluding that corporate profits were only flat in the last quarter, after growing by 3.5% in Q3. Consumer spending was also weaker than previously thought, at 2.5% compared to 2.8% estimated before. Business spending and investment was also revised down. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, argues that president Erdo\u011fan should stop attacking international investors, and start reassuring them. He writes: The Central Bank\u2019s efforts to dry up short term liquidity may have indeed made it impossible for speculators to short the lira. However, the lira\u2019s real issue isn\u2019t a surplus of speculative short sellers - it\u2019s a chronic deficit of faith in the currency among investors and locals, and the events of the past week have made things worse, not better. The central bank\u2019s liquidity freeze, combined with a poorly explained fall in already low FX reserves over the past month and a fresh round of low-rate rhetoric from Erdogan this morning, are the exact opposite of what would reassure investors. This morning\u2019s promises from CBRT governor Murat Cetinkaya that reserves rose in recent days and will continue to do so are encouraging, but what markets really need is an assurance that monetary policy will be set for the purposes of the real economy. Over in Turkey, president Erdo\u011fan has launched a stinging attack on western countries for (he claims) trying to create a currency crisis. Erdo\u011fan told an election rally in Ankara that recent lira volatility was due to attacks from countries such as the US, vowing to \u201cdiscipline speculators in the markets\u201d, Reuters reports. Erdo\u011fan also argued that Turkey\u2019s inflation rate will ease once the country has lowered interest rates -- a position which clashes with conventional monetary policy (which states that higher borrowing costs should squeeze inflation). The lira is still down around 5% today, at 5.8 lira to the US dollar, following those signs that Turkish banks have begun giving foreign counterparts access to the currency again. Robin Bew doesn\u2019t agree that the UK could soon resemble an emerging market..... but he still fears economic pain ahead. Uh oh! One of the world\u2019s most experience investment managers has claimed that a no-deal Brexit could create a currency crisis, and leave the UK looking more like an \u201cemerging market\u201d economy. Mark Mobius, a veteran of emerging market investing, told the Financial Times that the pound would tumble to parity against the dollar and Britain\u2019s credit rating would be cut, if it crashes out of the European Union. He argued: \u201cUp to now, the UK is riding on the coat-tails of the EU, in the sense that [the UK] can have very low interest rates,. \u201cAs soon as they break, people are going to start looking hard and fast. The rating agencies will say \u2018wait a minute, no more EU association? We\u2019ve got to downgrade.\u2019\u201d Mobius also warned that Britain is vulnerable to a market panic, given its large balance of payments deficit and large debt pile. The FT explains: The UK is like an emerging market now. Their balance of payments is terrible; their government debt is terrible; their fiscal debt is terrible,\u201d said Mr Mobius, who spent most of his career working for the US asset manager Franklin Templeton. The 82-year-old said that the UK lacked leadership and described the June 2016 referendum as a \u201cfraud\u201d because voters were \u201clied to and they made a mistake in making this vote\u201d. Newsflash: Eurozone economic confidence has sunk to its lowest level since 2016, with the UK particularly gloomy. The European Commission\u2019s gauge of economic sentiment fell this month, dragged down by rising pessimism among industry bosses. Consumers remain gloomy, and service sector confidence also dipped this month. This is the ninth monthly fall in a row, highlighting how the eurozone has become more anxious since last summer as growth has weakened, trade tensions have intensified, and Brexit deadlock has failed to ease. UK consumers are particularly anxious, the EC warns, with confidence the weakest since November 2013. BCC chief Adam Marshall adds that MPs should pick on of three options to end the Brexit uncertainty: They could choose to vote for the withdrawal agreement negotiated by the government over the past two years They could seek a longer extension to the Article 50 process, tied to a concrete purpose and endpoint Or they could choose to revoke Article 50 and commit to membership of the European Union for the immediate future. The head of one of Britain\u2019s biggest business lobby groups has called on MPs to stop \u201cchasing rainbows\u201d and avoid no-deal Brexit, warning that severe damage has been caused to companies across the country. Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, says that a \u201cBrexit black hole\u201d has pushed up firms\u2019 costs, lost companies\u2019 orders and put investments on hold, damaging the economy while the risk of no-deal Brexit remains. \u201cThree years going round in circles. Three years is long enough,\u201d he says at the start of the BCC\u2019s annual conference in Westminster. He says a firm he speaks to in the West Midlands has mothballed its flagship project and put some of its assets up for sale because its investors want to move their money, \u201cto a more stable country\u201d. \u201cUncertainty is generating a growing list of business casualties and a litany of rising costs,\u201d Marshall says, adding that MPs must do all that they can to avoid a no-deal Brexit. \u201cIt cannot be right that we leave in a way where government itself predicts there will be mass disruption to businesses and communities... A messy and disorderly exit would not just be deeply irresponsible \u2013 it would be a flagrant dereliction of duty.\u201d Newsflash: Goldman Sachs has been fined \u00a334.3m by Britain\u2019s City watchdog, for failing to report financial transactions properly for a decade. The Financial Conduct Authority says Goldman didn\u2019t provide complete, accurate and timely information related to over 213 million transactions, between 2007 and 2017. Mark Steward, FCA Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, says this blunder made it harder for regulators to spot financial crime: \u2018The failings in this case demonstrate a failure over an extended period to manage and test controls that are vitally important to the integrity of our markets. These were serious and prolonged failures. We expect all firms will take this opportunity to ensure they can fully detail their activity and are regularly checking their systems so any problems are detected and remedied promptly, unlike in this case.\u2019 Accurate and complete transaction reporting helps underwrite market integrity and supervise firms and markets. In particular, transaction reports help the FCA identify potential instances of market abuse and combat financial crime. One of Sweden\u2019s largest banks has dismissed its chief executive, just a day after being raided as part of an investigation into Russian money laundering. Swedbank CEO Birgitte Bonnesen was fired this morning, just minutes before she was due to face angry investors at its annual meeting. Several top shareholders had already pledged to vote against granting Bonnesen \u201cfreedom from liability\u201d from any future legal action from investors. Yesterday, prosecutors in Stockholm raided Swedbank offices, following reports that its Estonian operations handled \u20ac135bn of risky money from non-residents, mostly Russians. Swedbank Chairman Lars Idermark said in a statement. The developments during the past days have created an enormous pressure for the bank. Therefore, the Board has decided to dismiss Birgitte Bonnesen from her position\u201d Shares in Swedbank are down 3.7% today, adding to a 12% plunge yesterday. Currency expert Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fongern of MAF Global Forex flags up that Turkey goes to the polls in local elections this Sunday. With the country in recession, President Erdo\u011fan will want to avoid more financial angst before Turks head to the polls (although this rather backfired yesterday, when the main stock index fell almost 6%). Turkey appears to be relaxing the currency squeeze that spooked the markets yesterday. The overnight lira swap rate is now down to 50%, indicating that Turkish banks are providing lira to the markets again. Perhaps Wednesday\u2019s stock market tumble has persuaded the authorities that withholding lira from overseas speculators (and everyone else) was counterproductive, as it triggered a fire sale of shares and bonds. Sterling is weakening this morning, as investors worry that Britain could face the uncertainty of a general election, or the shock of a no-deal Brexit. The pound has shed almost half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.315, and half a eurocent to \u20ac1.168. Parliament\u2019s failure to approve any of eight alternative options for Brexit last night hasn\u2019t impressed the international markets. Theresa May\u2019s offer to resign, if her deal is approved by MPs, has added additional uncertainty. Chris Rodgers, senior fund manager at Sanlam Investments, argues that UK assets could rally if Brexit is resolved.... \u201cUncertainty continues to weigh heavily on the UK economy, and as we hurtle toward the cliff edge, all options are still possible. While Parliament has made it clear that a no-deal Brexit is unacceptable, it remains firmly on the table if the Government continues to procrastinate and fudge. \u201cFor foreign investors, the lack of clarity and direction remains off-putting, but the fundamentals of the UK do remain strong and domestically-focussed UK equities still offer real value. Investors may wish to consider their exposure to this asset class in advance of an anticipated uplift when clarity is finally established.\u201d Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, adds: Sterling tumbled yesterday evening as Brexit uncertainty haunted investor attraction towards the currency. However, looking at Sterling\u2019s overall price action, it does feel like the risk over a no-deal Brexit is underpriced. Last night, asset manager Will Slaughter wrote a handy twitter thread to explain Turkey\u2019s clampdown on overseas banks borrowing lira: (ST = short term; TRY = Turkish lira assets) (EMFX = emerging market foreign exchange) Reuters is reporting that the cost of borrowing Turkish lira for international banks has fallen this morning, but remains steep. The London lira overnight swap rate, which hit 1,200% on Wednesday, has now fallen to 180%. That still makes it very expensive to borrow lira to settle trades, of course. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank says sentiment against the Turkish lira \u201ccontinues to be weak\u201d. The market turmoil comes before local elections on Sunday, with the government likely hoping to maintain FX stability ahead of the votes. The Turkish lira is falling sharply against the US dollar in early trading. It\u2019s down almost 5% at nearly 5.6 lira to the US dollar, back towards the five-month high struck last week. This suggests that the currency crackdown imposed this week has worried international investors. Turkish banks are reportedly under orders not to lend lira to foreign counter-parties, to prevent them speculating against the currency (by \u2018shorting it\u2019, and then hoping to buy it back cheaper). Australian and New Zealand government bond yields have both hit a record low today, on expectations of interest rate cuts. That comes after New Zealand\u2019s central bank surprised the markets by saying it may cut borrowing costs to fresh record lows soon (not start raising them, as expected). That weakened the New Zealand dollar against other currencies.... putting pressure on other central banks to retaliate. Reuters explains: That is one reason markets are wagering the Reserve Bank of Australia will also be forced to cut rates, simply to stop its currency from appreciating. Policy easing then becomes a self-fulfilling cycle across the world. The continued dovish shift by G7 central banks, ongoing support by the Chinese authorities, and the move by the RBNZ will keep pressure on the RBA to also move in the same direction, however reluctantly,\u201d said Su-Lin Ong, head of Australian and New Zealand strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cIt is, essentially, a global policy cycle.\u201d Concerns over the global economy helped to push shares down in Asia today. Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost 1.6% and China\u2019s SSE Composite Index shed 0.9%. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS, suggests investors are flummoxed, with some choosing to keep on the sidelines: Global markets remain in a state of uncertainty as investors are trying to decide whether they should go on a risk-on or risk-off mode. The dollar has seen mixed price action over the past 24 hours with 10-year yields dropped to fresh lows, and commodity dollars driving lower while yen gained. Equities were mixed, gold retreated deeper and oil dropped below $60 again. The conundrum facing traders is whether to sell because the economy is slowing, or buy because central bankers might speed it up again. Anthis explains: The combination of easier monetary conditions and bearish market data makes it hard for traders to make up their minds on whether they should grow more risk prone or averse. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Anxiety over a global economy slowdown is building today, with warning lights flashing in the bond market - and a potential currency crisis bubbling away in Turkey again. Investors continue to pile into safe-haven government bonds, driving up prices and sending yields (interest rates) steadily lower. That\u2019s a classic sign that the markets expect low growth, or even a dreaded recession. Overnight, the yield on US 10-year Treasuries has fallen to a 15-month low, following signals from several central bankers that the global outlook has weakened. This means the US yield curve (a graph of the prices of bonds of various maturities) continues to invert. That\u2019s a worrying sign -- indicating that investors are losing faith that growth will continue in the long term. Other G7 government bond yields are also sinking, signalling that growth concerns are broad-based. As Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group puts it: Wall Street closed in the red and Asian markets traded broadly lower as developed-market bond yields continued to fall overnight. US 10-year treasury yields hit a fresh 15 month low, whilst Australian bond yields spiralled to a record low and Japanese bond yields are at levels not seen since 2016. The rapid and persistent decline in bond yields is unnerving investors about the economic outlook. Turkey is also creating some angst, with a crackdown on foreign banks borrowing lira causing financial ructions yesterday. Ankara says it is determined to prevent speculation weakening the lira - but economists fear the currency squeeze will hurt its economy. Stocks fell sharply in Istanbul yesterday, as investors sold assets to get their hands on lira to settle trades, after the rate to borrow the currency overnight soared over 1,00%. Also coming up today New eurozone confidence data, and updated US growth figures, may shed new light on the state of the global economy. UK business leaders and politicians will be gathered at the British Chambers of Commerce annual conference - expect Brexit to feature very heavily. City traders will be casting a nervous, weary eye towards Westminster, for signs of a Brexit breakthrough. The pound held pretty steady yesterday, despite MPs rejecting eight different ways out of the mess.
