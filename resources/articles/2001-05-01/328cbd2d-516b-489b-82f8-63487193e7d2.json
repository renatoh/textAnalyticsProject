Redheads", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/may/21/mondaymediasection8", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2001/may/21/mondaymediasection8", "fields": {"headline": "What are you...", "bodyText": "You don't have to have red hair to be a redhead. The marketing term refers to persons with a \"hot head\" rather than a ruddy quiff and includes more than 6m people. Typical redheads do things on the spur of the moment, operate on gut instinct, speak their mind and like to stand out from the crowd. Redheads pride themselves on telling it like it is so expect to hear comments such as: \"All this furore about mobile phones and radiation - it's like saying you shouldn't cross the road in case you get knocked down.\" So where can we meet them? Socialising is important to redheads - they enjoy a good night at the pub and reckon that low alcohol lagers are for wimps. Sixty percent of redheads are male and most live outside London, with 10% domiciled in Scotland. They are mostly aged between 15 and 34 and the bulk are 25-34 years old. What do they watch on their nights in? The average redhead watches one to three hours of TV every day. Channel 4 is their favourite terrestrial channel, although 44% of them also get multi-channel TV. Top shows include The 11 O'Clock Show, The Simpsons, Sex in the City, Ibiza Uncovered and Hollyoaks. Sports also attract a good share of redheads, but the highest ratings go to Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (54% tune in) and EastEnders (42%). Are they regular newspaper readers? More than 40% of redheads say they rely on the papers to keep them informed. The majority like an easy read and go for the Sun, the Mirror or the Daily Mail. However, this group is also likely to include readers of the Independent and the Times. And which magazines appeal? A female Redhead will often go for Cosmopolitan or Company but some choose Vogue to keep up with the latest fashions. The male of the species likes magazines that talk straight - FHM, Loaded and Maxim - and is more likely to buy style magazines such as The Face and Arena than the average man. How do you spot a redhead? Attitudes towards holidays sum up redhead spontaneity. Expect to hear comments such as: \"I often book last minute holidays - they aren't always cheaper but when you've got to go, you've got to go\" and \"I try somewhere different every time, which means taking a risk. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, but that's half the fun.\" \u0095 Data supplied by MediaCom Compiled by Alastair Ray"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
