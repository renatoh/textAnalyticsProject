That there is still a class system in this country is undeniable; that it pre-dates the advent of the public schools is historically self-evident. Public schools are a symptom, not the cause. Monbiot's reference to a continental Europe devoid of public schools is pertinent, in that the state provision of education in Sweden or the Netherlands precludes the opportunity for an independent sector to develop. Herein lies the answer, and it is one that has been known by teachers for years. The crucial advantages public schools are perceived to possess are small classes and generous resources. Double the number of teachers in state schools, give them status and well-funded support, and you will not only undermine the raison d'\u00eatre of the public school system, but also re-energise a profession that is overworked and feels undervalued. But that would cost money. Chris Widdows Taunton, Somerset George Monbiot makes a telling case for the removal of the charitable status given to private schools. There are, however, large gaps in his argument. Not all children are sent miles away to board and mix with the gentry. Many attend independent day schools in just about all our major towns and cities, and many benefit from the experience. When confronted with their local state secondary and the absence of choice, many parents choose an independent school without consideration of elitism or politics - they simply wish their own children to have an education where academic standards and discipline are high, and extra-curricular activities are abundant. Many also look to go independent because they have a child with special needs, or a particular musical, artistic or sporting talent. Monbiot should address the fact that successive governments since 1945 have ensured that so many of our children receive a very poor education in poorly constructed buildings. It is because of this that so many parents reach into their savings or remortgage in order to send their children to private schools. Lee Hanson Leeds Having been sent to boarding prep school at eight and attended one of Nick Duffell's boarding-school survivors' workshops, I strongly agree with George Monbiot's observations about the psychological damage such places inflict. However, by lumping together today's diverse, mostly non-boarding, private schools and placing them anachronistically in a time of colonial administration, Monbiot plays into the hands of those on the conservative right who would like to see the educational argument reduced to a simplistic one of \"class war\". The irony is, for all his dismissals, the only agency that has really ruffled the feathers of the private education elitists is that of the Charity Commission, which is prepared to exercise some progressive pressures in the name of true charitable purpose - including cooperation with the state sector. No doubt more could be done, but proper application of the principle of \"public benefit\" could mean the abolition of \"early boarding\", and its associated emotional ills, in the near future. Simon Partridge London George Monbiot states that \"private schools continue to capture public resources, by buying up the best teachers [trained at public expense]\". I work in an inner-London school, teaching history to secondary-school students. Many teachers within private schools teach without any officially recognised pedagogical qualifications. In contrast, an individual wishing to teach students within a state school must pass a rigorous training programme, such as the PGCE. While the intake at a private school is carefully controlled through entrance examinations, state schools teach students from their catchment area. The results that many state schools achieve are testament to the outstanding teaching practised in such institutions. Adam Porte London I enjoyed George Monbiot's rant about elitism and the class system. Indeed, I could almost see the saliva dripping from the corner of his mouth. Among sporadic good sense could be found the extreme and the inaccurate - in particular, his reference to boarding prep schools. Moor Park is full of rounded, happy, confident children - day pupils and boarders. They enjoy the experience - a far cry from Monbiot's jaundiced memory. Perhaps he should take a closer look at modern boarding? Mike Piercy Head, Moor Park George Monbiot is right to question the ludicrous charitable status of public schools - but he's wrong to suggest that \"The system is protected by silence\" and that \"... its most abject victims become its fiercest defenders.\" The only famous people to survive the public school I attended were the members of Radiohead, and they've hardly been silent about their experience. While some of their songs are pretty opaque, I suspect that even the headmaster (whom I recall with equal distaste) recognises the target of the following lyric from their song Bishop's Robes: \"In bishop's robes / Bastard headmaster / I'm not going back / I'm not going back / I'm not going back / Children taught to kill / To tear themselves to bits / On playing fields.\" We don't need a class war, we just need to put Thom Yorke in charge of education policy.
