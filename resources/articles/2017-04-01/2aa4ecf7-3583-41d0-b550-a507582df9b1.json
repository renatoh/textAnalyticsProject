It was Tuesday back at Selhurst Park, with the majority of those present still pinching themselves at the riotous dismissal of Arsenal the night before, and the buzzwords at the launch of the Palace for Life Foundation were community, opportunity and responsibility. All seemed to carry considerably more weight with memories still fresh of Wilfried Zaha bamboozling Mesut \u00d6zil on the touchline or Jason Puncheon swarming around central midfield less than 24 hours previously. \u201cIf you have a core of a team that has that connection to the local community, who can explain to people when they arrive at the club what it all means, it makes a big difference,\u201d said the Palace chairman, Steve Parish. \u201cWilf and Punch were brought up round here. They\u2019re from the same streets and have experienced the same problems as the kids they\u2019re now inspiring. They sense it. \u201cThe first thing Puncheon did when he signed for us from Southampton was buy a [hospitality] box, which I thought was quite good because no one wants their family to watch them be bad. The gaffer has made him captain and he has grown. He\u2019s gone all serious now whenever I try to talk to him. You can see what it means to him emotionally. So if you can get a club like Palace pointing in the right direction with the local community behind it, you can achieve extraordinary things. That\u2019s what you need at a club this size. You\u2019re not going to outgun people with money or resources, so you\u2019ve got to do it a different way.\u201d The rebranded Foundation \u2013 with Ed Warner, the chairman of UK Athletics and a fan for 40 years, taking on the role of chair \u2013 is Palace\u2019s attempt at doing just that. The vast majority of clubs run community schemes geared towards retaining that status at the hub of their locality, with Palace for Life to concentrate efforts on 11 core programmes through Bromley, Sutton and Croydon, one of the country\u2019s 10 most deprived boroughs but a hotbed of football talent, and potentially up into Lambeth. \u201cA lot of non-statutory youth provision has been lost, given austerity and cutting back on public services at local level,\u201d said the Labour MP for Streatham, Chuka Umunna. \u201cThere is simply not enough for our young people to do out of school to channel their energy, so the kinds of initiatives the Foundation does are vital.\u201d It worked with 9,143 participants in 2015, more than three times the number from 2012 when Palace were in the Championship, on its various programmes, from mentoring the disadvantaged to promoting physical and mental health. More than half were under 12. The hope is the numbers will grow, particularly with Palace close to securing a fifth consecutive season in the top flight for the first time. They host Leicester on Saturday, eager to build on five wins from six matches. Sam Allardyce strode around the pitch at Selhurst Park watching the club\u2019s Down\u2019s syndrome team training, the children occupying the central third of the turf while a Premier League Kicks session and an elite academy game were staged on either side. Matt Sharp from Palace\u2019s powerchair football team was also present; the Foundation, benefiting from donations from the Juli\u00e1n Speroni fund, the Premier League and the BT disability programme, has purchased a chair per player. Each costs \u00a36,000. Those present heard testimonies from people such as Angel O\u2019Dwyer, who grew up on Stroud Green estate a few miles from Selhurst Park and, having been doggedly persuaded to participate, freely admitted she \u201cwould have been in prison or dead\u201d without the Foundation\u2019s support. \u201cIt is about giving young people a better chance in life,\u201d said Warner. \u201cThere is so much this football club can do with the power of the Palace brand in south London, in areas of deprivation, to change the lives of young people in the community. Palace for Life is the hidden gem of this football club.\u201d Parish said: \u201cIt\u2019s incredible how, when you put a football club badge on someone or something, it engages kids. Everton have a school [the Everton Free School on Liverpool\u2019s Spellow Lane] they have part-funded and, since they\u2019ve been involved, the school has had better engagement from the kids and, remarkably, from the parents. Look at the Primary Stars videos: there\u2019s one where they engage a kid who loves football, but has been a bit of a bad lad in his time, in education by telling him every time he scores a goal in a game he won\u2019t get credited with it until he has solved a maths question. It\u2019s clever stuff. \u201cThere is a massive difference between being \u2018stupid\u2019 and \u2018uneducated\u2019. These kids have not been exposed to education because it is not cool. But if we can make someone like Angel come out of a life of crime and inspire her to get into something else, whatever it is, then great. It\u2019s not just about Crystal Palace. Clubs up and down the country are doing this, but it gets lost. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of good work being done.\u201d Relegation, still not entirely out of the question, would affect funding. The Premier League contributes heavily to clubs\u2019 community schemes, as well as those of clubs up and down the pyramid whether they are former members of the elite or not. Palace for Life, which does benefit from some local authority funding, gains around 47% of its money from the league\u2019s central pool. \u201cIt\u2019s a big chunk and, if the worst did happen, it would affect everything,\u201d said Parish. \u201cBut we would look to try and replace it. Once you see the amazing work the Foundation does, you\u2019d hate it to get to the point where it couldn\u2019t do as much, just because we went down.\u201d Warner has been encouraged by the Premier League\u2019s focus on Palace. \u201cThey have a clear strategy geographically and see this club as absolutely integral to what they are trying to do in this part of London,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an area which has loads of challenges, lots of deprivation, but also almost boundless opportunity. The Premier League\u2019s work is massively underrated. But this is a relatively modest charity that is working extremely hard almost to outperform its resources. There is scale to come, but it can\u2019t just be from the Premier League. Over time, we want to become more independent.\u201d New fundraising initiatives will be stepped up locally aimed at increasing the 2.2% provided by donations. The more money raised, the more full-time staff can be employed and the greater the scope of the project. \u201cWe have a tremendous responsibility,\u201d said Parish. \u201cWe want to be the focal point of the community and to be about everything that is good in south London.\u201d That dismissal of Arsenal provided some short-term cheer. The growth of Palace for Life is aimed at longer-term improvement in this corner of the capital."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
