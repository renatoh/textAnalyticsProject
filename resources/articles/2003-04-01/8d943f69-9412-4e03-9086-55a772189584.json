The league regards voluntary administration as an escape route from non-football debts and could in the summer authorise the docking of points from, or even the enforced relegation of, clubs using the loophole. Leicester's case is understood to have cost their former manager Peter Taylor \u00a3200,000 in lost compensation payments and Holmes attacked the move to hit clubs on the pitch as \"extraordinary\". He said: \"We did the only deal possible to save the club. We did not make the players take a wage cut. We did a commercial deal with the Inland Revenue, which it accepted on a voluntary basis. The Football League's argument is extraordinary. We did a deal to secure the future of the club - the alternative was that it would be wound up. \"If that doesn't suit other clubs, they can expel us from the league if they want. That would probably involve the loss of one of the strongest clubs outside the Premier League. I don't think they can afford to lose that. Their grumble really was that we have been clever doing the deal.\" Holmes, who resigned as managing director of agents SFX Sports to take up the post at the Walkers Stadium, also criticised proposals from the G14 group of leading European clubs to link wage payments proportionally to revenue. He considered the concept to be unlawful protectionism. \"It's laughable and probably illegal,\" said Holmes. \"All that would ensure is that the bigger clubs stay bigger. They are trying to take the piss out of the smaller clubs. \"If you look at the history of the Premier League, the only time the stranglehold of Arsenal and Manchester United was broken was by a club that paid way above in terms of salaries, Blackburn. The big clubs are saying: 'We like competition provided we always win.' \"Moves towards salary caps and cuts look like a group of villains, the club owners, seeking an amnesty arrangement with the law. Their greed and lust for success has led them up the wrong path.\" The Coventry City midfielder Youssef Chippo has joined Al-Sadd of Qatar on a six-month loan. The Moroccan international is one of 10 players to have been told he no longer figures in the plans of the manager, Gary McAllister as he seeks to reduce the club's debts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
