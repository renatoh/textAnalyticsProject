The unanswered question was whether he would define himself as representing change or continuity with the Blair years. The tragedy of his premiership is that two years on, that question remains unanswered. A worthy speech on education yesterday \u2013 the first of a run on domestic policy aimed at recapturing the initiative \u2013 left all but specialists scratching their heads about what exactly the prime minister wants to change. Listen to the speech once and then read back over it, and it is becomes apparent that there was some substance. In particular, there was a cautious defence of the role of local education authorities against Tony Blair's one-time view, now echoed by the Conservatives, that state schools should be cut loose to run themselves. From admissions to exclusions, it is true to say that no school is an island \u2013 the advancement of one often comes at the expense of another. So there was merit in Mr Brown's pledge of new powers for parents to get something done about low standards right across neighbourhoods, as opposed to in individual failing schools. The details are extremely sketchy, but there are several plausible ways in which this idea might be developed in a white paper due in the summer. It was welcome, too, to hear the prime minister stress professional autonomy in those classrooms where things are going well. But Mr Brown is deluded if he expects much credit for charting a course between the demands of the National Union of Teachers and those who believe the education of young minds should be governed by market forces. Most people, of course, had far better things to do yesterday than listen to his speech once, still less to read it through again. If this is the relaunch, then it is doomed to fail because \u2013 in Hazel Blears's weekend phrase \u2013 there is a lamentable failure to get the clear message across. An excruciatingly unfortunate snap or the prime minister in front of three swastikas at the school where he gave yesterday's speech underlined not only how unfair political life can be, but also the importance of political luck. Luck, of course, can change. The problem, however, goes deeper than communication; there is also confusion about what the message is meant to be. How exactly, for instance, does the new talk about new professional freedom fit with the new obligation for every pupil to receive their report in a particular way by 2012? The same rhetoric sits even more uncomfortably with the continuation of something close to the discredited Sats tests for 11-year-olds, something else Mr Brown appeared to signal. Even if the wonkish bit of his brain can see some ingenious way to make all of this cohere, the political lobe should surely appreciate that the wider world will discern only mixed messages and a failure of nerve. That much is guaranteed by the political context in which the prime minister operates, a context for which he bears some responsibility. It is a context where it is reported that he risks the wrath of one team of colleagues by seeking the counsel of rival clique of advisers the very next day. And it is a context where one set of his aides let it be known that they were actively considering the creation of a not-for-profit Royal Mail, before junior ministers took to the airways yesterday to signal their readiness to hold out for privatisation, relying on Tory votes if need be. One passage of yesterday's speech argued \"the defining test for any political party will be, not whether it can take power, but whether it can give it away\". The prime minister is an intelligent man. Except when playing chancellor to the world, however, he struggles to give an intelligible account of his agenda. Unless he starts to spell it out soon, it will not be long before he passes his own test by giving power away \u2013 although not in the way he intended."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
