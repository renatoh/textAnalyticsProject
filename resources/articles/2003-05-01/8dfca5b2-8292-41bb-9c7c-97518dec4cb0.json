The far-right party also won seats in Broxbourne, Sandwell and Stoke-on-Trent. Though the BNP's results in no way make a national rival of Britain's traditional parties, they will give them all pause for thought. The BNP suffered one setback, however, in Oldham, where its leader, Nick Griffin, failed to win a seat despite polling 993 votes. He was comprehensively beaten into second place by the Labour candidate who polled 1,684 votes. Mr Griffin, who owns a farm in Powys in Wales, rented an abandoned cricket field in the village of Diggle on the outskirts of Oldham, so he was eligible to stand in the elections. He refused to be downcast after his defeat, telling journalists: \"I have come a very good second. Labour has had to pull out all the stops and put on a massive campaign in order to stop me being elected.\" Mr Griffin said the resurgence of the BNP meant all the political parties were \"on a level playing field\". And he predicted that there would be BNP gains in Oldham next year, when the whole council is up for election. In Burnley, the BNP was jubilant. It was the big winner of yesterday's elections, winning two more seats than Labour. As only a third of the council's seats were up for re-election, however, Labour retains control of the council. Labour activists were downcast at the count, while Anti-Nazi League activists attempted to storm the hall and scuffle with the BNP. In Stoke the BNP won one seat, with Steven Batkin getting elected by 144 votes. The party's four other candidates were less successful. Mr Batkin told reporters: \"I am going to speak out against the asylum seekers' issue, and I will continue to do pensioners' gardens. \"This is a vote against the massive immigration to this country. British people are beginning to see that their culture is being eroded away.\" Fellow councillors reacted with dismay to the BNP's victory. Labour councillor Derek Bamford said: \"The asylum issue had got nothing to do with the city council, there is nothing we can do about that. \"When we get into the council chamber and we are talking about clean streets, old people's homes and children's education, what will he have to say then? As far as I am concerned the BNP doesn't have any other policies except for this, I will say, fascist agenda.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
