It covers every aspect of government, ranging from asylum policy and the extent to which inequality will be reduced, to the birthweight of newborn babies. In what will be seen as Labour's hidden manifesto for the general election, the government has set out more than 200 targets, backed in the last few weeks by a growing number of comprehensive agreements on how the targets are to be defined and delivered. Critics claim the preciseness of the targets will prove to be a big hostage to fortune. The furore over Labour's failure so far to meet two of its five election pledges underlines the political pitfalls of making measurable promises. Most of the targets are due to be met by 2004 or 2005, the likely date Labour will go to the polls seeking a third term. Health Heart disease: Cut deaths from 69,000 in 1997 to 51,500 by 2005. Cancer: Reduce deaths by 69,000 to 61,000 in 2005. Suicides: Cut from 4,500 in 1997 to 4,000 in 2005. Outpatients: By 2005, all appointments will be prebooked. Waiting lists: By the end of 2005, maximum waiting time for outpatient appointments down to three months and for inpatient treatment to six months. Figures for third quarter of last year show 25% of patients are still waiting more than three months for an outpatient appointment and more than six months for inpatients. Community care: As many as 130,000 elderly people people to be helped in the community, rather than hospital. Crime Vehicle crime: Reduction of 30% by 2004 from the baseline of 1998-9. Will need cut from 1,071,000 to around 700,000. Burglary: Cut of 28% by 2005 from baseline of 464,000. Latest figures show burglaries at 417,400. Robbery: By 2005 robbery of personal and business property in London to be cut by 15% from 1999-2000 figures. Cut of 34.1% by 2004 in West Midlands; by 20% by 2005 in Greater Manchester; 15% by 2004 in Merseyside; 21.4% by 2004 in West Yorkshire. Robbery in England's big cities would fall by 14%. Fear of crime: By 2004, should be lower than levels to be recorded in the British Crime Survey in 2001. Cost of crime: A target, yet to be agreed, will be issued. The figure is currently estimated at \u00a360bn. Charges: By 2002, the number of recorded crimes brought to justice would be increased from the 1998-9 figure of 1,202,037 crimes cleared up out of 5,109,110. Reoffending: Cut of 5% against the predicted rate by 2004; 30,000 offenders to complete accredited programmes and the number of prisoners getting jobs to double. Asylum By March 2004, 75% of asylum applicants will be decided within 61 days. The number of removals will rise from 7,850 in 1999-2000 to 37,000 in 2003-4. Education Key stage 2: By 2002, 80% of children taking English to achieve level 4; 75% taking maths to achieve level 4. David Blunkett, the education secretary, has already promised to resign if these targets are not met. September 2000 figures showed 75% had reached level 4 in English, up 4% on the previous year, and 72% had reached maths level 4 - up 3%. Figures in 1996 were 52% English, 54% maths. New targets will be set for 2004. No local education authority should have an, as yet unfixed, percentage of pupils failing to reach the new target. Key stage 3: By 2004, 80% should achieve level 5 or above in maths; 75% in English and IT; and 70% in science. Figures in September 2000 showed 65% reaching the level in maths (up 3%), 63% in English (down 1%) and 59% in science (up 4%). At least 65% of pupils in each education authority to reach this target in English and maths. GCSE: By 2004, 92% of pupils to obtain five or more GCSEs at grades A to G. In the 500 worst performing schools, 75% should obtain five or more GCSEs at A to C. The current figure in these schools is 18%.

Children and poverty Child protection: By 2004, proportion of children aged 0-3 in 500 sure start areas who are re-registered on the child protection register within 12 months should fall by 20%. The measure is designed to see if emotional and social support is improving. No baseline has been established. Smoking: The number of mothers who smoke during pregnancy in sure start areas to fall by 10%. Baseline to be established in December 2002. Speech therapy: By 2004 number of children aged 0-3 with speech and language problems requiring specialist intervention will have fallen by 5 points. Baseline to be ready by December 2002. Target also to be prepared for the use of libraries by parents in sure start areas. Unemployment: By 2004, fewer children aged 0-3 in sure start areas will live in households where no one is working. Childminders: By 2002 a national register should be established and in the following year daycare providers to be inspected annually. Welfare Children: Number of children in low- income households to be reduced by a quarter by 2004. Households with incomes 60% or below the median to be covered. Baseline is 4.2m children in low-income households after housing costs and 3.1m before housing costs.Reform child support scheme for new cases by April 2002 so by the next year the accuracy rate for assessments and reviews is not less than 90%, with payment arrangements established on average within six weeks. The level of compliance should be at least 75%. Pensions: Reform second tier by 2004 so stakeholder pensions give more people access to good value funded second pensions. Access will be measured by surveys. Two million carers and 2m disabled people with broken work records have for the first time started to build up a second-tier pension. Fourteen million low and moderate earners have started to build up a better second-tier pension than would be possible under the old state earnings-related pension. Low and moderate earners are defined as anyone earning between \u00a33,432 and \u00a321,600. Benefits: By 2005 85% of claimants should have their benefits paid into bank accounts. The figure in October 2000 was 33%. Fraud and error in income support and jobseekers allowance should be reduced by 25% by March 2004. The baseline is \u00a31.38bn fraud and error in September 1998.

Acute care: By the end of 2004, the cost of acute care commissioned will have fallen to the level of the currently cheapest and best-performing trusts. Jobs and the economy Employment: Over the cycle, increase employment, defined as seasonally adjusted International Labour Organisation employment figure. A baseline will be set in spring 2001. The cycle is judged to have started in mid-1999. The number of children in households with no one in work to be reduced. A baseline will be set in spring 2001 and progress monitored every six months Over the three years the relative employment rates of disadvantaged areas and groups should be increased taking account of the economic cycle. The pledge is aimed at people with disabilities, lone parents, ethnic minorities and the over-50s, as well the 30 local authority districts with the poorest initial labour market position. The baseline is spring 2001. The 30 districts are Hackney, Islington, Newham, Southwark, and Tower Hamlets in London; City of Glasgow, Dundee, East Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, and West Dunbartonshire in Scotland; Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath, Pembrokeshire and Rhondda in Wales; Easington, Halton, Hartlepool, Hull, Knowsley, Liverpool, Manchester, Middlesbrough, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Redcar and Cleveland, Salford, South Tyneside, Sunderland. Environment and transport Air quality: Improvement should be made against seven indicators between 2003 and 2008 with a baseline of 1998.

Current estimate is that 29% of housing is not is in a decent state, with 43% in the 841 most deprived wards. Establish a new target for bringing abandoned houses back into use. By April 2002 reduce the number of people sleeping rough by two-thirds compared with June 1998 when 1,850 slept rough. Roads and rail: The government has still not established targets or a system of measurement for the reduction of traffic congestion in cities and trunk roads. Rail use should be increased by half by 2010, measured in passenger kilometres, at the same time as improvements in punctuality and reliability. The first milestone will be to increase mileage by 15% by 2001-2 compared with the 1999-2000 figure of 38.3bn passenger kms. The latest quarter showed mileage rose by 38.4 passenger kms.

Treatment: Increase the participation of problem drug users in drug treatment programmes by 55% by 2004, by 66% by 2005, and by 100% by 2008. No baseline exists.
