Although the front three of Harry Kane, Jadon Sancho and Raheem Sterling sparkled in a win that enabled Gareth Southgate\u2019s side to tighten their grip on top spot in Group A, errors from Michael Keane, Harry Maguire and Declan Rice for Kosovo\u2019s goals left England with plenty to ponder. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait until the next meeting to analyse it properly,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of emotion involved when you come straight in from a game, so I think that will have to come at the next camp. That will be important because we need to learn from tonight. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to reflect. You\u2019re going to have goals scored against you but I thought we reacted really well after the goal in the first half. That\u2019s a good sign. But second half there was a little bit of sloppiness. We\u2019ll have to look back at the goals. I couldn\u2019t imagine they were great goals from our point of view.\u201d Although four consecutive victories have put England in a commanding position, Henderson accepted they need to defend better. \u201cWe\u2019re scoring some brilliant goals and we look so dangerous on the break,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we turn over the ball we break with pace and look frightening at times. But football is about defending at times and you need to keep clean sheets. That\u2019s important if you want to win things.\u201d However the Liverpool midfielder believes Southgate\u2019s young side are moving in the right direction. He reserved special praise for Sancho, who opened his England account with two goals. \u201cI thought Sancho was brilliant at times,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cHe was so good with the ball, his runs and his final product. There\u2019s still a lot of positives. We\u2019re still confident and feel we\u2019re going in the right direction, but we\u2019re far from being the perfect team. We want to be even better.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
