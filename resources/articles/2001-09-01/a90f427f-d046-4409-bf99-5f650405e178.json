Yet he may well resurface as a rugby union player with Wasps. The 35-year-old winger has been ruled out of Salford's final Super League game of the season, Sunday's relegation decider against Wakefield, through injury and has resigned himself to bringing his glorious league career to an end. He said: \"I've had a cortisone in my shoulder and one in the ankle so I won't be playing this weekend. I would say it's more than likely that I've played my last game of rugby league, though you can never say never.\" Offiah recently scored the 500th try of his phenomenal career, which included a couple of stints in Australia. His official, League-recognised total of 481 leaves him third in the all-time list of try scorers, behind only Australian Brian Bevan (796) and Welshman Billy Boston (571). The former Widnes, Wigan and London Broncos winger has not yet decided to hang up his boots, however, and has an offer on the table from Zurich Premiership club Wasps. Offiah began his rugby career with union side Rosslyn Park, from where he switched codes in 1987. He also had a spell with union club Bedford in 1996. \"It's all up in the air,\" he said. \"The opportunity is there for me if I want it. I'm going away on holiday next week and then I'll make a decision. \"I've just got a couple of niggling problems. The doctor said, 'Go away on holiday, get back into training and you'll be alright.' I think that's the best thing to do, give it one last shot and see how it goes.\" Offiah, whose contract with Salford runs out this weekend, has managed just seven tries in a season dogged at a personal level by hamstring, shoulder and ankle injuries and also by the team's indifferent form. For a player who spent most of his 15 seasons at the highest level of the game and won every trophy and honour apart from an Ashes Series, the last two years have been something of an anti-climax. The Reds have won just one of their last 10 games and are condemned to a 10th-placed finish, one spot lower than last season. \"Things started off quite well for us and by Easter we were sitting in the top five,\" he said. \"But I got injured and Bobbie (Goulding) got injured and the season fell apart from there. We had a bit of a rally when we beat Warrington and Wigan but, apart from that, the second half of the season has been a pretty disappointing time. \"John Harvey resigned as well but we thought we were going to pick up quite a few points in the last seven or eight games with the run-in that we had but I think the side has lost a bit of confidence.\" A sixth successive defeat against Wakefield on Sunday will enable the Wildcats to survive in Super League, sending Huddersfield down into the Northern Ford Premiership."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
