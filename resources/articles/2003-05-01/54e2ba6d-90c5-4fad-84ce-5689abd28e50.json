Last year he wore an outfit in tiger stripes, in 2001 a catsuit depicting the internal organs of the body and on both occasions he was fined for breaking clothing regulations, which merely added to the story. Such sartorial extravagances are perfectly in order for cycling's greatest showman. Cipollini is variously nicknamed \"the Lion King\", \"the Sun King\" and \"the fastest man in the world\", graces fashion shows with his bella figura, swaps shirts with Ronaldo, has a room in his Tuscan mansion devoted solely to fur coats and shoes and is legendary for a bike shoe advert in which he was portrayed being fed grapes by scantily dressed nymphs. Italy's best sprinter has a chance tomorrow to make a far more substantial mark in the Giro's opening stage around the city of Lecce, deep in the heel of the Italian boot. Victory there, in what is likely to be his final year of racing, would give him his 41st stage win in the Giro, would equal the record held for 70 years by one of the great names of Italian cycling, Alfredo Binda, and would - subject to time bonuses - earn him the maglia rosa , the pink race leader's jersey. Cipollini is already ahead of such nonpareils as Eddy Merckx and Fausto Coppi in the Giro d'Italia stage rankings but it is the comparison with Binda that is striking. Binda was one of the original campionissimi , a \"champion of champions\", and he set his record by dominating the Giro in the late 1920s in outrageous style, by taking eight victories in successive days in 1929, for example. It is truly an achievement from another age, equivalent to Jesse Owens setting four track and field records in 70 minutes in 1935. So dominant was Binda that he was paid by the Giro organisers not to start the 1930 race, merely to maintain some interest. The 2003 organisers have adopted the opposite approach with Cipollini. Soon after he won the world title last October on the Zolder motor racing circuit in Belgium they changed the first day's format from the usual time-trial to a flat road race, probably with the sprinter in mind. \"The record is my major goal for the Giro and that is what everybody in my Domina Vacanze team will be working for,\" Cipollini said. \"The first stage in Lecce is a perfect opportunity for me. Then hopefully I can then win another stage in the first week to make the record my own. \"I'm not a great champion like Binda or Coppi - I haven't won any major stage races - but breaking the record would be something special and would give me a place in cycling history,\" Cipollini said. \"Winning the first stage, equalling the record and pulling on the pink jersey all from just one sprint would be an impressive triple.\" Intriguingly, given his brash exterior, Cipollini is modest about what the record would mean. \"I will be part of cycling history but, frankly, putting the name Cipollini alongside the likes of Coppi, Binda, Bartali, Merckx and Hinault is not serious. People, fans, consider me a champion but I know that I am a sprinter, perhaps the best sprinter. Sprinters are a bit mad, a bit narcissistic, and there's a lot of that in me.\" Far more than a record hangs on Cipollini's performance in the next three weeks. The Italian is determined to earn a place in the Tour de France, where he enlivened the opening week for most of the late 1990s and won four stages in a row in 1999. In 2000 a crash kept him away and in the following two seasons he was not invited by the organisers, who felt that his habit of winning several stages and then going on holiday when the race hit the mountains was sending out the wrong message. This mortally offended the proud Tuscan. He felt he had vastly enlivened the Tour with his sprinting, not to mention his colour-coordinated racing bikes, shorts and jerseys or an unforgettable episode in 1999 when he turned up at a stage start dressed as Julius Caesar, having invited all the press to a party where a stripper called Cleopatra was the star guest. After accusing the Tour organisers of being provocative - \"how many French riders do they invite who no one has heard of?\" - he retired last July in a huff, timing his announcement to create headlines during the Tour. He then changed his mind in August, trained like a demon and duly won the world title to prove that he would have been worth a place in France. The Tour organisers will have their chance to end the soap opera on May 19, nine days into the Giro, when they name the final four teams for the Tour. There is another subtext to Cipollini's attempt to earn immortality. He is the only cycling star in Italy still untouched by a drugs scandal and the Giro is struggling to regain its credibility after four years in which the race has been rendered meaningless three times thanks to a string of positive tests and a massive police raid during the 2001 event. The state of Italian cycling is summed up by the sight of its former hero, Marco Pantani, winner of the Giro and Tour in 1998, desperately trying and largely failing to regain his good name since being thrown out of the race in 1999. The record would be the best way to push those issues into the background, which is why the race organisers will be as desperate as Cipollini to get off to a perfect start.
