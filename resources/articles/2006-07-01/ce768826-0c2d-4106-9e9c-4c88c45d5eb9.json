Some of the issues it dealt with - especially security of supply and cost - would surely have been included. But the overwhelming evidence of global warming has transformed nuclear power from a source fraught with risk into a much more attractive carbon-free alternative to gas and coal-generated electricity. The rehabilitation of the nuclear industry would have been hard to imagine in 1986, in the wake of Chernobyl. But other things, apart from climate change, have changed the debate since then. Britain's nuclear industry's safety record, while not flawless, has been respectable over the past 20 years. As things stand, Britain's aging nuclear power stations generate 20% of this country's electricity. As they are decommissioned, only one will still be in operation in 20 years' time, contributing just 6% of the overall electricity supply. Added to that shrinking base, a substantial portion of Britain's coal-fired power stations will also have to close to meet EU environmental legislation. Tony Blair has made it plain for some time in public - and even longer in private - that he favoured building new nuclear power stations to help fill this gap. The energy review puts Mr Blair's desires into black and white, including the important qualification that the private sector should pay for and operate the new stations, and share the waste disposal and decommissioning costs. That is important, although the review leaves unanswered some important questions regarding regulation, planning and insurance that will be addressed in the white paper due out later this year. The most important unanswered question remains how to deal with nuclear waste. For that we must wait for the final report, later this month, of the committee on radioactive waste management, on potential sites for \"geological disposal\" - deep burial - a process the committee warns may take several decades to finalise. Then there are the likely sites for any new stations, and the likeliest candidates are those sites that currently house nuclear plants, for obvious reasons. An important exception is the Sellafield site that has long been the subject of vociferous opposition in Ireland. If the government intends to continue using Sellafield then it must ensure that Ireland's valid objections are met and resolved. Mr Blair and Alistair Darling are right to say that Britain needs a mix of energy sources. For that reason, replacing Britain's aging nuclear infrastructure with a new generation of safer and cheaper nuclear generators is a sensible step. That will not be popular in all quarters, even with many of those who are greatly concerned by climate change. What is important is that renewing Britain's nuclear generators should be seen as a stop-gap measure. That is why replacing the current proportion of power generated by nuclear means, rather than increasing it further, is important. Over-emphasis on nuclear power could dangerously distort Britain's energy market and crowd out funding and research into alternatives. Technology alone will never be a silver bullet, but in 20 to 30 years' time there is the prospect of renewable energy and alternative sources - such as hydrogen-powered transport - making deep inroads into the country's carbon output. Meanwhile, exciting new forms, including tidal generation and biofuels, are all on the cusp of mainstream development, along with carbon capture and storage techniques that may even turn coal into the fuel of the future. Substantial spending on efficiency, especially in overhauling Britain's energy-profligate housing stock, will also repay itself many times over. But all of these require time, and renewing the nuclear base will provide that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
