The speaker said al-Qaida was open to a truce with the US if it withdrew from Iraq and Afghanistan and that the only reason there had been no attacks on US cities since 9/11 was because it had not attempted any. \"The delay in similar operations happening in America has not been because of failure to break through your security measures,\" the speaker said. \"But the operations are happening in Baghdad and you will see them in your houses as soon as they are complete, God willing.\" The excerpt of the tape, aired on the al-Jazeera television channel, did not say what the conditions for a peace deal were, only that it would be \"a long term truce based on fair conditions ... so both sides can enjoy security and stability under this truce so we can build Iraq and Afghanistan\". The recording - whose authenticity could not immediately be assessed - is the first claimed to be from the al-Qaida leader since December 2004. Al-Qaida recordings through 2005 were from Ayman al-Zawahiri, Bin Laden's ideological mentor and second in command. The recordings praised the July 7 suicide bomb attacks on London's transport system and marked the fourth anniversary of the September 11 2001 attacks on the US. It is not the first time al-Qaida has offered a truce to the west. Following the killing of 191 people in the March 2004 Madrid railway bombings, a tape recording of Bin Laden offered peace to any European country that stopped \"attacking Muslims or interfering in their affairs\". In November of that year, a recording from Zawahiri told the US it could either \"choose to treat us with respect ... or we will continue to fight you until you change your policies\". However, the claim in today's recording that al-Qaida had not carried out attacks on US soil because it had not made sufficient preparations contradicted claims in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 that \"the storms will not calm, especially the aircraft storm\". Muslims in the US and Britain were also warned not to live in tall buildings. The command structure and camps that Bin Laden and Zawahiri built up in Afghanistan were destroyed in the US-led war to oust the Taliban, and it is thought unlikely the inner core around Bin Laden has control over terrorist groups that have adopted the al-Qaida name and methods. A July 2005 letter from Zawahiri that the US claimed it intercepted urged Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, to avoid alienating potential followers by bombing mosques and beheading hostages."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
