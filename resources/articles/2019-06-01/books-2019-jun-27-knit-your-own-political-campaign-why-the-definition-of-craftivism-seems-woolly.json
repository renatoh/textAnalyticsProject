The online knitting and crochet platform Ravelry banned patterns for MAGA hats and other pro-Trump creations that, it said, promote \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d. Could this be an example of what is known as \u201ccraftivism\u201d: the use of crafts to advance a political agenda? \u201cCraftivism\u201d is a portmanteau of \u201ccraft\u201d and \u201cactivism\u201d, like the more familiar hacktivism (politically engaged computer hacking) and slacktivism (supporting a cause in a way that involves minimal effort, simply to parade one\u2019s virtue). The political sense of \u201cactivism\u201d itself is first recorded in 1915 with the specific meaning of \u201csupporting Germany during the first world war\u201d, before it happily widened to describe any kind of political agitation. Some craftivists, perhaps, are not immune from \u201cbacktivism\u201d, short for \u201cpat-yourself-on-the-backtivism\u201d, a sneering name for the act of declaring that one is now woke to some issue. And while \u201ccraftivism\u201d might seem among the least persuasive of such constructions, it has been around since at least 2005. To the extent that writing itself is a craft, let\u2019s hope it sticks around a while longer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
