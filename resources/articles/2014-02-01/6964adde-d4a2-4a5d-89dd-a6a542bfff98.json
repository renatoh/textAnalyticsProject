The confrontation between President Viktor Yanukovych and the growing popular protest movement has lurched back and forth since late November, with violent episodes punctuated by truces, talks and attempts at mediation. It was dangerous, and often seemed beyond control, but it was possible to imagine it ending in some muddled compromise or in a deal with the European Union that the president could use to fend off his critics. But the problem was that the original cause for the protests, the suspension of talks on an association with the EU, became less and less important. Demands that the EU negotiations be reinstated and the closer relationship with Russia that the president had embraced be repudiated were eclipsed by an insistence that the president and all his people step down and the corrupt, coercive and quasi-criminal system through which they were said to be ruling be dismantled. The deaths of so many in Kiev on Tuesday, followed by a crackdown on so-called terrorism across the country and allegations that a coup was under way, have almost certainly taken the Ukrainian government, the formal opposition and the protest movement beyond the point of no return. Perhaps advised by President Vladimir Putin, Mr Yanukovych, who has used force both inconsistently and ineffectively throughout, decided to get tougher. The result is a deepening of the crisis that will affect not only the fate of Ukraine, but that of Russia, the European Union and the United States. At stake for Ukraine are its chances of a decent political future, for, if the present government stays, it will be able to do so only by using more and more force and by criminalising all the protesters, something it has already begun to do. Early elections might represent a way out, but it is hard to imagine the regime, having chosen the path of repression, making such a concession. At stake for Russia is Mr Putin's credibility, and that of his own system, not so very different in some respects from Mr Yanukovych's. Although there is much Russian popular support for him on the Ukraine issue, this might well erode if the situation there slipped into wider violence or even into something akin to civil war. Ukraine is not Georgia, done and dusted in a weekend. On the other hand, if Mr Yanukovych were to be pushed from power, that would be a far bigger defeat than the mere signing of an EU agreement would have been. At stake for the EU, already weakened by the euro crisis and by its own internal divisions, is its weight in international affairs and in its own continent. Did the EU mismanage the Ukraine negotiations by failing to offer, on the side, a financial package that would have rescued Mr Yanukovych from his debtors? Did it imply too strongly, as some believe, that a closer relationship with Brussels excluded a close relationship with Moscow? Should it have more strongly backed Poland, the EU country that takes Ukraine most seriously, when the Poles argued that the situation should get more attention? Should it have instituted sanctions, on the president and others, when Mr Yanukovych's bad faith in offering and then withdrawing concessions, in pledging not to use force and then using it, became apparent? Perhaps sanctions would have made little difference. But, whatever the rights and wrongs of that, the EU does not emerge with its reputation enhanced, and the loss of prestige could prove permanent. At stake for the United States is its already prickly relationship with Russia. That has implications for arms control and for American diplomacy on Syria and Iran. Co-operation between America and Russia has slipped badly, but what remains is still a requirement for an orderly world. Thus it is that Ukraine has gone from being a story of trouble in a distant place to being an issue which could profoundly affect all our futures."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
