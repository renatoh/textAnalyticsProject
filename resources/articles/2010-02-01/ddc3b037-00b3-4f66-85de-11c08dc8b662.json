Leading by 12 points at the interval before a sell-out 13,024 crowd, the Wolves looked to be coasting to victory but once their influential half-back Lee Briers had left the field with a leg injury after 51 minutes Wigan hit back in spectacular fashion to go top of the Super League table. Wigan had to withstand some heavy pressure from the kick-off, but went ahead when Amos Roberts received the ball just over the halfway line and, having skipped past Ben Harrison, the full-back showed great speed and balance to beat several defenders on his diagonal run to the line. Warrington took a while to get into their stride but midway through the half they took the lead when Richie Myler crossed unopposed. Briers made it 6-4 with the conversion and soon afterwards a penalty gave them a great attacking platform. Michael Monaghan, Briers and Richie Mathers all handled superbly but it was a brilliant catch and pass by Chris Bridge that allowed Chris Riley to score in the corner. Just before half-time Monaghan was denied a try by the video referee but David Solomona blasted over from short range and with Briers adding the conversion they went in at the interval with a 16-4 lead. The Wolves then lost Briers and Wigan brought themselves back into the game with two tries in three minutes. Roberts claimed the first, Darrell Goulding squeezed in at the corner and Pat Richard converted to make it 16-14. He then levelled the scores with a penalty before Wigan took the lead when Sam Tomkins chipped and regathered before passing to James Leuluai who put Joel Tomkins over. Richard made it 22-16 with the conversion but with seven minutes remaining Louis Anderson crashed over to bring his side to within two points. Solomona was then denied a try by the video referee to give Wigan their third successive victory. In last night's other Super League game, St Helens crushed Catalans Dragons 42-12 despite being 8-0 down after nine minutes.
