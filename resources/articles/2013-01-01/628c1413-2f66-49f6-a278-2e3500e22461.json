Liverpool have spent millions bringing young talent into their academy from home and abroad in recent years, with Raheem Sterling the latest notable success and Andre Wisdom signing a new long-term contract with the club on Wednesday. Rodgers, however, insists it is a priority as Liverpool manager to ensure Carragher and Gerrard are followed into the first team by fresh local talent, and claimed there will be added emphasis on that search during his reign. The Liverpool manager said: \"My big thing is getting young players in here from the local area in Liverpool. Look at the history here \u2013 Carragher, Gerrard, McManaman, Fowler and Owen. Who have been the best two English players in the Premier League in the last six 0r seven years? Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney. Both scousers, not from a million miles apart, so you are not telling me there is not top young talent out there in Liverpool. \"It is sexy to look at Spain and I am someone who loves working with European players. All my life I have worked with players from different parts of the world. But we mustn't forget what is on our doorstep and, for me, this is a hot-bed for footballers who have passion, hunger and incredible qualities. Bringing that through is a massive part of my job and is something we are trying to put in place.\" The improved output from Liverpool's youth academy was reflected in a new contract for Wisdom, who has followed Sterling in committing his long-term future to the club within months of breaking into the first team. The 19-year-old defender, who joined Liverpool from Bradford City in 2o08, has made 14 senior appearances this season and played twice for England Under-21s. \"It was an easy decision to make,\" said Wisdom. \"As soon as they offered it to me I grabbed the opportunity with both hands because it's a great club and I just want to continue to play for Liverpool. I am happy with the progress I've made so far and hopefully I can progress more in the second half of the season and continue to keep playing. There's still so much hard work ahead.\" Liverpool still hope to re-sign former academy player Thomas Ince in January but remain in a stand-off with Blackpool over the fee. Liverpool are entitled to 35% of a future transfer fee for the 20-year-old under the terms of his move to the Championship club last summer and have therefore offered \u00a34m for the \u00a36m-rated midfielder. Blackpool are holding out for an increased offer. Rodgers has also granted Nuri Sahin's agent permission to find the on-loan midfielder another club in January but they would have to agree to pay the 24-year-old's Real Madrid wages. Sahin arrived amid much fanfare in August, having rejected a loan move to Arsenal, but has failed to secure a regular first-team place and could rejoin Borussia Dortmund, providing his old club can finance the deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
