We know Chelsea will be challenging to retain the crown and they know we will be working as hard as possible to win a third one in five attempts.\u201d Despite Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s balanced view, on the evidence of this showing the Premier League title-holders should be concerned. The Chilean\u2019s men continued the dazzling stuff of last Monday\u2019s 3-0 win at West Bromwich Albion to register the same scoreline against Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s team. Next up for City is a trip to Merseyside to play Everton on Sunday. The Goodison side will hardly be licking their lips at the prospect. At the close Mourinho could be seen muttering at the fourth official, who ignored him. As an image of Chelsea impotency this was apt. 2 Sagna and Kolarov soak up rare Chelsea pressure Manchester City flew at Chelsea in a blur of sky blue. From the front-foot first full-backs, Bacary Sagna and Aleksandar Kolarov, to a dynamic Yaya Tour\u00e9 and a Jes\u00fas Navas offering his finest display for the club, City started in fifth gear and remained there all afternoon. Even when soaking up rare Chelsea pressure, City had a snap in the tackle and a muscular presence that was illustrated by the elbow Fernandinho stuck into Diego Costa that had the striker riled. This cocktail of brawn and balletic brilliance suggests City can prosper domestically and in the Champions League this season. 3 Begovic displays quick hands on full debut The 1-0 deficit Chelsea stared at during the interval would have been tripled if not for the Bosnian\u2019s quick hands on his full debut as replacement for the suspended Thibaut Courtois. A veteran of 158 Premier League starts for Stoke City, the 28-year-old showed in his display the wisdom of the choice that he should replace the departed Petr Cech. There was an uncertain moment between the keeper and Gary Cahill before he jumped on the ball. Yet then came the two fine saves; both from Sergio Ag\u00fcero, low to Begovic\u2019s left and goal-bound. The one Ag\u00fcero did put past Begovic he could do little about. 4 Chelsea need a reboot. Already As City\u2019s dominance continued the sense that Mourinho\u2019s band were easing into the game and waiting for their chance gave way to the realisation that they remain under-cooked and unconvincing. The champions did show more after the break but there was none of the control the Portuguese demands from his teams. \u201cWe are speaking about 38 matches,\u201d Mourinho had said. \u201cIt is an eternity, a marathon that started last week. I cannot say [this match] is not crucial, I cannot say it\u2019s not very, very, very important. They are title contenders so three points are important but I cannot say that a win will mean anything significant.\u201d A five-point deficit to City after two matches is hardly ideal, though. 5 Sterling, Ag\u00fcero and Silva make three-point turn A feature on Raheem Sterling in the programme was headlined: \u201cLet me entertain you.\u201d He, Ag\u00fcero and David Silva did. Sterling\u2019s pace made a mug of Branislav Ivanovic. The naming of City\u2019s new \u00a349m No10 in the XI meant the Ag\u00fcero-Silva-Sterling trident started for the first time. It caused Chelsea to suffer all match and should do so repeatedly to other opponents through the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
