It has been broken 25 times. His teams are expected to put theirs where he did as a player. Coventry did not fail him. They simply met their resilient match in a side that had a plan and stood four-square by it. As a result, in a clash of the division's last unbeaten records, Bristol City displaced them at the top for a few hours. Gary Johnson could not hide his satisfaction. \"We knew they had a gameplan,\" he said, \"to get the ball forward quickly to Dele Adebola, but we knew, if we defended strongly and passed well, we could hit them on the break.\" They did, scoring from their second as well as their last. \"Tactically it all went to plan. We defended the first ball really well.\" The centre-backs, Louis Carey and Liam Fontaine, deserve the main credit but no one flinched from start to finish, back to front, side to side. \"We trust in ourselves and believe we can compete at this level,\" said Johnson, \"and every success adds to that belief. To motivate players you need ones who are able to be motivated. There are some who like being footballers more than they like playing football.\" This was an indictment of a culture that had accepted players as city celebrities. In two years Johnson has run it out of the club and lifted his team from the lower end of League One. Bristol fashion is a byword for good order and the club is threatening to lose its \"unfashionable\" tag. The away end here was full with 3,400. Things are less certain with Coventry, where takeover is in the air. Their managing director, Paul Fletcher, reassured fans that both interested parties see Dowie as \"part of the long-term future of the club\". But less than two-thirds of the home seats were taken, suggesting not everyone likes his direct style. The cusp is a recurring point of Guardian conflict, mistakenly defined in the style book as \"a place where two points meet\". Points do not meet. Arcs do with a common tangent. So, in Dowie's world, do players - not glancingly but in fierce, physical collision. Perhaps he should coach rugby but at least footballers are not best-of-breed contenders at a livestock show. The opening charge was fearful in its speed and impact but Bristol City, once they had scored, found the poise to play themselves out of defence. Coventry were restricted to long shots. Between Bristol City's breakaways was a flapping own-goal by Dimi Konstantopoulos. \"Soft goals are killing us,\" said the hard man Dowie, still generous in defeat. After Coventry's power Bristol City face West Brom's polish tomorrow as Dowie goes back to Crystal Palace and his courtroom foe, Simon Jordan. \"Just another game,\" he said but, more than ever, he will want his men to put their noses on the line.
