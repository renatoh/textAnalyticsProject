Such is the interest in the all-Irish Heineken Cup semi-final between Leinster and Munster that Shane Warne could cycle naked down O'Connell Street at 3.05pm without being noticed. It is certainly true that Ireland has never known an oval-ball fixture which has evoked such parochial excitement: its two strongest rugby provinces head-to-head for a place in the northern hemisphere's showpiece grand final, a century-old rivalry with a modern twist. In yet another unfortunate piece of scheduling the national Irish census is being conducted on Sunday: given the exodus of Munster fans in the direction of Dublin there is a risk of Limerick being registered as a hamlet. Only an All-Ireland hurling or Gaelic football final could stir the same degree of domestic passion, the sole frustration being that more supporters are not able to see the contest live. Ireland's soon-to-be temporary home Crokle Park, with its 82,500 capacity, would have made a fantastic backdrop; instead a little over half that number will fill the condemned stands of Lansdowne Road, reducing the din from potentially ear-splitting to merely thunderous. There will, at least, be 21,400 fans clad in red and, in theory, the same number in Leinster blue, although anecdotal evidence suggests a percentage of the Dubliners' ticket allocation has ended up in Munster hands. No wonder. Munster's Heineken Cup story is among the most evocative crusades in modern sport. From the distant thrill of beating Toulouse in Bordeaux at this same stage six years ago to two losing finals and the miracle wins over Gloucester and Sale, no rugby team on earth has mixed pragmatism with fairytale romance so consistently. Hence the reason why, in remote west Cork over Easter, almost every replica jersey on view bore Munster's crest, save for the odd GAA exception and one poor misguided soul in blue with Robben written on his back. Munster men are deadly serious when it comes to rugby. Donncha O'Callaghan, the Irish lock who, bizarrely, once had a pet lobster which he took for walks on a piece of string, is transformed from mischievous prankster into wild-eyed strong-man alongside the imposing Paul O'Connell. Their captain Anthony \"Axel\" Foley, poised to become the first man to play 75 Heineken Cup games, will anchor the back row and Ronan O'Gara will kick for the corners with a sniper's precision. Fuelling it all will be twin rocket-boosters of injustice: a wish to give the boys from Dublin a hurry-up and the desire to win a title which has become Munster's holy grail. The snag is that Leinster know their enemy inside out. O'Gara knows precisely how Brian O'Driscoll operates while Keith Gleeson and David Wallace are twin burrowing moles and until relatively recently Munster's coach Declan Kidney was in charge at Leinster. \"Sometimes, those games can become a stalemate because you know the guys you're playing against so well,\" conceded O'Driscoll this week. \"You know what you're going to get: you're going to have a very physical, very keenly contested, body-on-the-line type of game.\" O'Driscoll does not concede, though, that \"The Match\" is effectively between Leinster's electric backs and Munster's supercharged forwards. \"The Leinster pack has had to deal with an awful lot of adverse publicity, yet time and time again this year they have fronted up against very good teams.\" Neither has he been exchanging pleasantries with his Irish international mates. \"I'm sure friendships will be resumed come Monday morning but you have to get into a zone and that's the way it has been with myself and my Munster friends.\" The prop Marcus Horan's calf problem may slightly dilute a bubbling Irish stew of a forward contest as far as Munster are concerned. But, while Leinster's epic quarter-final win in Toulouse has made them slight bookies' favourites, Munster generally prefer it that way. Woe betide Michael Cheika's Leinster if they underestimate their opponents' willpower. \"If any side is geared to stop them up front it is Munster,\" warned the former Irish captain Donal Lenihan. \"Come to think of it, I can't think of any side that would want to beat them more.\" A mighty clash of Celtic tigers awaits. The quality of the Argentine-Irish midfield of Felipe Contepomi, below, Gordon D'Arcy and Brian O'Driscoll is what worries Munster fans. The finishing power of Shane Horgan and Denis Hickie, and the rejuvenated Girvan Dempsey at full-back give more cause for concern. Munster must strangle the life out of their opponents. How Munster can stall slick Leinster machine Brendan Fanning Defence It needs to start with the forwards, primarily at the lineout where Leinster will attack Munster's throw at every opportunity. The more successful they are at this phase, the easier will be the next part of the plan. And involves a blitz defence. Just as Wasps did to Munster at this stage of the competition two years ago, they have to defend from the outside in, hard and fast, killing space before it can be exploited. Attack Again, the forwards must generate momentum as Munster do not counter attack from deep. When they used their pack to clear out aggressively and free up quick ball against Edinburgh last weekend it gave their backs front-foot possession. Munster then developed it by offloading in the tackle, going through the opposition not around them. Backs must stay on their feet as long as possible. Key confrontations Ronan O'Gara versus Contepomi. The Puma gave the Ireland fly-half a few horrible moments in the Celtic League on New Year's Eve but O'Gara recovered. It comes down calmness under pressure and O'Gara will back himself to deliver."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
