On Wednesday police used used rubber bullets, batons and teargas against people in Hong Kong protesting against the bill that would tighten Beijing\u2019s grip on the semi-autonomous territory. The US president, who is engaged in a major trade war with Beijing, said he hoped the protesters could \u201cwork it out\u201d with Beijing. \u201cI understand the reason for the demonstration, but I\u2019m sure they will be able to work it out.\u201d He did not say how he thought the issue would be resolved. Speaking at the White House, Trump said the demonstrations were massive. \u201cThat was a million people. That was as big a demonstration as I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I hope it all works out for China and for Hong Kong,\u201d Trump added. \u201cI understand the reason for the demonstration but I\u2019m sure they will be able to work it out. I hope they\u2019re going to be able to work it out with China.\u201d The European Union said rights \u201cneed to be respected\u201d in Hong Kong. \u201cOver the past days, the people of Hong Kong have exercised their fundamental right to assemble and express themselves freely and peacefully. These rights need to be respected,\u201d the EU\u2019s external affairs ministry statement said. \u201cRestraint should be exercised by all sides; violence and escalatory responses must be avoided,\u201d it added. The outgoing British prime minister, Theresa May, called for the rights and freedoms set out in the 1984 Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong\u2019s future to be respected. \u201cIt is vital that those extradition arrangements in Hong Kong are in line with the rights and freedoms that were set down in the Sino-British joint declaration,\u201d May told parliament in London. The British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, echoed her words, urging the Hong Kong government to \u201clisten to the concerns of its people and its friends in the international community and to pause and reflect on these controversial measures\u201d. \u201cIt is essential that the authorities engage in meaningful dialogue and take steps to preserve Hong Kong\u2019s rights and freedoms and high degree of autonomy, which underpin its international reputation,\u201d Hunt said. US Representative James McGovern, a Democrat, said he and Republican co-sponsors planned to put forward legislation on Wednesday or Thursday that would likely raise the standard for determining whether Hong Kong was sufficiently autonomous to receive special treatment from the US on trade and economics. \u201cThe president should look at the reaction in Congress,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cThere is bipartisan outrage over what is happening ... peaceful protesters being met with terrible violence by Hong Kong security forces. It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d The Australian government raised concerns about the proposed amendments to the extradition laws and supported the right to peaceful protest and urged restraint on all sides. Foreign affairs minister Marise Payne said: \u201cThe Australian government believes it is important that any changes to Hong Kong\u2019s extradition arrangements are ... resolved in a way that fully respects Hong Kong\u2019s high degree of autonomy and upholds the rights and freedoms enshrined in Hong Kon\u2019g Basic Law under the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 framework.\u201d On Wednesday, Hong Kong\u2019s leader, chief executive Carrie Lam, called the protests \u201cdangerous and life threatening acts\u201d. She noted that some young people in the crowd had expressed their views peacefully, but said the protest had devolved into a \u201cblatant, organised riot\u201d. Taiwan\u2019s prime minister, Tsai Ing-wen, said her nation supported the protesters. \u201cYou may feel your demands for freedom seem to fall on deaf ears, please know that all like-minded friends in #Taiwan &amp; around the world are standing with you,\u201d she tweeted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
