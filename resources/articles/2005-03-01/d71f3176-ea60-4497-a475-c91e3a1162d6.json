Business Week Online reports: With his new company, Numenta, which he'll unveil on Mar. 24, he's trying to do no less than create machines that work just like the human brain. \"This could radically change the way that computer systems work,\" says Harry Saal, a Silicon Valley veteran and one of a handful of investors in the company. Hawkins and an associate, it says, \"have come up with a way to translate his theories into electronic terms. Their company will license -- for free, at least for the first few years -- technology to others who may want to create what he predicts will be truly intelligent machines.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
