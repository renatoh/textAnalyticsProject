But Sid Domic, an Australian who played at Barrow with Warrington in a Challenge Cup tie in February and has been suffering from a mystery illness for more than a month, has tested negative for the disease. The Barrow coach expects Clark to return to the team next Sunday at Whitehaven but said: \"Now that we've had this outbreak my mind has gone back to a virus he had a few weeks ago. He was shivering and had flu-like symptoms and was tested for all sorts but they couldn't find anything wrong, and in the end they put it down to depression.\" Warrington, meanwhile, are increasingly concerned about Domic, who was led shaking to the team bus after Saturday's 72-2 thrashing at St Helens. Blood tests cleared him of legionnaire's disease and glandular fever, but he will go into hospital for further scans today. Domic's wife and two children are also ill, and three other Warrington players have reported similar symptoms - although two of them, Jerome Guisset and Paul Wood, have now fully recovered, and the third, theWales stand-off Lee Briers, could return after a two-week absence against Castleford next Sunday. There is also growing speculation about the position of Warrington's coach David Plange after Saturday's heavy defeat, although Andy Gatcliffe, the chief executive, has insisted there will be \"no quick decisions\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
