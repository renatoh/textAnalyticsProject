It\u2019s really a tunic, but I like pissing people off by calling it a dress. I\u2019m always attracted to unconventional designers and I like clothes that have fun with gender norms \u2013 because it is something to mock, to laugh at. I was drawn to it because I thought it made me look like a monk \u2013 I was like, just call me black Rasputin. I\u2019ve worn this outfit lots of times: to Afropunk, at a party that the editor-in-chief of Vogue [Anna Wintour] hosted, and a Vanity Fair shoot. I\u2019m not saying I go commando \u2013 but it\u2019s a bit like the rule with kilts: wearing pants with this would be a cop-out. There\u2019s no way I could wear a dress like this in Jamaica. For the most part, I dress like I\u2019m a Jamaican from the 70s when I\u2019m there: really colourful polyester shirts, formal pants, sneakers, and I might wear a tam, which is the headgear Rastafarians wear to keep the dreadlocks in. It\u2019s funny because I show up there and people are like: \u201cWow, you\u2019re dressing wild,\u201d and I\u2019m like: \u201cAre you serious? I\u2019m kind of dressing conservative!\u201d When I go there, I say I\u2019m back in my \u201cbutch drag\u201d. As I have become comfortable in my own identity and my own body, I have also become comfortable expressing that freedom with different kinds of clothes. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I probably have more suits than anybody but having the freedom to wear a dress is something I\u2019ve picked up as I\u2019ve got older. I also wear a lot of long shirts from Japanese designers. My style icons are Grace Jones, Andr\u00e9 3000, Prince \u2013 but early Prince \u2013 and any member of The Clash. I often just think, what would Paul Simonon wear? I always dress up to write \u2013 let\u2019s call it \u201cexpensive casual\u201d. One thing I do not do is put on slippers and a bathrobe or pyjamas because when I go to write, I go to work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
