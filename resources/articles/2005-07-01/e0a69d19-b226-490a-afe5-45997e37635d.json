In the course of W-Worker's Circus, their reinterpretation of Woyzeck, members of the company eat wet cement, breathe fire and drink bags full of urine-coloured water. In more upbeat scenes they muck around naked in a pit of sand. In case this sounds like torture for an audience - let alone the actors - I should add that W-Worker's Circus is as breathtaking as it is punishing. There's method to the masochism in Arpad Schilling's highly physical compelling production, which draws on fragments of the Hungarian poet Atilla Jozsef's work, as well as Georg Buchner's 1837 play about a soldier driven to madness, despair and murder. Marton Agh's set traps the cast in a rusting metal cage: what we get is a demented experiment to find out how much one man can bear. After a beautifully playful scene in which Woyzeck and his lover, Marie, give their child a bath, we watch their happiness drain away. When Woyzeck (the astonishing Zsolt Nagy) isn't working, he's undergoing physical and mental torment in the name of science at the hands of Gergely Banki's terrifyingly insane, helium-voiced army doctor. In Buchner's text Woyzeck is fed nothing but peas, here he's forced to down pint after pint of pee. The preening Drum Major who cuckolds Woyzeck has the physique of a circus strong-man. When he beats up his rival it's a grim joke - like watching a professional wrestler take on a clown. Marie gazes at the Major and sees a way out of grinding poverty; he takes her simply because he can. In the play's final moments, the alienated Woyzeck rips off Marie's clothes, and the sound of fabric tearing and the look in her eyes fills us with horror. W-Worker's Circus was staged for one night as part of the Festival of Central and Eastern European Theatre at Riverside Studioes. Kretakor's version of The Seagull is at the Edinburgh Festival next month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
