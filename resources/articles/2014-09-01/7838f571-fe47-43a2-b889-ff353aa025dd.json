Models wearing dramatic, floor-sweeping coats and mirrored sunglasses strode across a geometric glass catwalk suspended over swirling dry ice. It was a step change in atmosphere from the rarefied morning slot that Balenciaga has previously occupied, suggesting that, after four seasons in charge, Wang \u2013 who splits his time between his own label in New York and Balenciaga in Paris \u2013 is now fully confident in the direction he is driving the historic French house. Backstage, the excitable designer declared the collection to be about \u201copulence\u201d before he was swamped with congratulations from Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, their baby North and assorted bodyguards. Wang\u2019s Balenciaga represents a successful marriage between the label\u2019s dramatic archive cuts and his own, more easygoing aesthetic. Embellishment and embroidery were used in a less precious way \u2013 overblown diamond-shaped lattice pockets added a sportswear edge to floor-length cream coats. Sporty tops \u2013 a Wang favourite \u2013 were given the Balenciaga treatment in delicate lilac shades with shimmering beads and jersey-ribbed collars. String-vest-style skirts that sat below the knee were both sporty and luxurious. Mirrored sunglasses were secured to models\u2019 heads like ski goggles using heavily beaded straps. Decadent utilitarianism was the show\u2019s paradoxical theme. Earlier in the day, an act of quiet rebellion set the agenda. At the finale of the Dries van Noten, rather than strutting backstage in a flurry of flashbulbs, the models sat down and lolled about on the tufted, moss-coloured catwalk. Amid the ritualised world of fashion weeks, this end scene \u2013 which intentionally recalled Millais\u2019 Ophelia painting \u2013 was remarkable enough to set a dreamy tone. Backstage, the Belgian designer explained that he had been inspired by A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. \u201cSo it was about a girl who loves festivals \u2013 Stonehenge, Glastonbury, Burning Man. She loves nature; she doesn\u2019t follow the rules, so she puts on really precious fabrics in whatever way she wants.\u201d This was a collection with fabric, print and textiles at its heart. Van Noten that this, rather than some confected trend, had been his focus. \u201cFor me it is not really a collection,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of nice clothes in very nice fabrics.\u201d Next summer those nice clothes will include silk-striped bomber jackets, heavily beaded oversized easy tunics and dropped-crotch brocade trousers with folded, pannier-like pockets. Gold thread and patches of sequins added restrained sparkle to the easy shapes. But Van Noten was wrong if he thought the collection was simply an ode to beautiful textiles. Silk brocade bermuda-style shorts worn with heavy wedge shoes and a multicoloured sequined T-shirt seemed in tune with the trends emerging from London and Milan and were a real highlight in this compelling collection."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
