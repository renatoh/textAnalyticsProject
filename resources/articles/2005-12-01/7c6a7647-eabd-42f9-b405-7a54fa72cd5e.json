Walking back from a night out, one of the Pakistani Test cricket team was jumped by a couple of policemen who came out of an alley and grabbed him. A young Asian out late, according to too many official mentalities in 1971, meant only trouble. \"Luckily, the rest of us turned round to see where Selim was,\" says Khan, who is back in the Yorkshire city this week to be installed, amid much local excitement, as the new chancellor of Bradford University. \"They realised that we'd seen what was happening, pushed him down and said: 'Keep quiet about this.'\" Attitudes have changed out of all recognition in Bradford since that brief, unpleasant encounter, but the memory serves Khan well as he joins West Yorkshire's interesting group of celebrity chancellors. Like Melvyn Bragg at Leeds, Patrick Stewart who boldly went from Startrek to Huddersfield and the runner Brendan Foster at Leeds Met, he is a useful role model as well as a celebrity. This won him the appointment above 24 other potential candidates. The other three chancellors are all northerners made good. Khan is a Pakistani who has done the same, but along the way to international success - he is \"arguably the most famous Asian in the world\" says the Bradford Telegraph &amp; Argus proudly - he hasn't been insulated from prejudice. When he preaches the usual virtues, as he did to 500 saucer-eyed school students at a \"Raise your game\" session before his instalment, he knows the extra obstacles those who are black and Asian are likely to face. \"Integration is a two-way thing,\" he says, deploring the aggressiveness of young Asian gangs but understanding the refusal to put up with racial barriers, veiled or crude, which it partly signifies. The answer, he says, is to enlist frustrated energy for the common good, by finding young people jobs, and good ones. Researching the university, and weighing up how much time he could spare from his leadership of Pakistan's Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) party, he was convinced by the favourite statistic of Bradford's vice-chancellor, Chris Taylor. Out this duly came when Taylor introduced Khan amid the gowns and razzmatazz of inauguration day. \"Bradford is the top university in the north for getting students into jobs after graduation,\" said the vice-chancellor, adding with the tone of a runner about to overtake the favourite: \"Nationally we're second only to Cambridge.\" Khan, an Oxford PPE graduate, was impressed by that, and particularly by the effect on ethnic minority students who now form almost half of Bradford's intake. He also senses a buzzy atmosphere; rocked back on its heels by the much-publicised street violence in Bradford in 2001, the university has turned things round. It no longer relies on being the cheapest place in the country for students to live. New building is going on everywhere, applications are up by 30% this year, and having an international celebrity at the next table in the student caf\u00e9 isn't going to do any harm. \"Sports hero and heartthrob, it's quite a combination,\" muses Maria Rice, a student at one of Bradford's five-star departments, peace studies, after putting the new chancellor through his paces on the taxing politics of Kashmir. There are sides to Khan's CV that might undermine his role-model status with Muslim families, but at 53 he turns heads within the Pakistani community more for his persistence with politics and his fund-raising for good causes. That was another decider for the Bradford job. His first formal duty was to lay the foundation stone of the university's new Institute for Cancer Therapeutics. Much of his energy since retiring from cricket in 1992, after leading Pakistan to their only World Cup victory, has gone into building and running the Shaukat Khanum cancer hospital in Lahore. He named it after his mother, who died because specialist treatment for her cancer was not available in time in Pakistan. Khan also wants to tap Bradford's expertise in matching students to jobs for a new technical college in the Naimal valley, part of his constituency in Pakistan, where his Yorkshire honour will lend him a political hand. Criss-crossing between Pakistan and Britain is something many in Bradford's Pakistani community do, and it appeals to Khan too. \"It's only five hours away,\" he points out. \"I'll be pleased if I can help to show the diversity of Pakistan to people here,\" he says, adding a final reason for his decision to bat for Bradford, 15 years after saying goodbye to cricket. He wants to end the word association between his country and terrorism, potentially strong in West Yorkshire after the London bombers were traced here. \"There are 150 million of us in Pakistan,\" he says, looking forward to promoting the 149.9 million who seldom, if ever, make the headlines."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
