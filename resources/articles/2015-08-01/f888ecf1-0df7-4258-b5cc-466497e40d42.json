Instead the winger turned away from the goal where he had just scored, ran towards where his family were located and pointed both of his hands towards the sky. It was a poignant moment for Albrighton following a summer of personal tragedy. The mother of his partner, Chloe, was among the 38 tourists killed in June\u2019s terrorist attacks in Tunisia. Sue Davey was just 43 when she died alongside her own partner, Scott Chalkley, near the Imperial Marhaba Hotel and the weeks since have been harrowing for all those who knew them. For Albrighton it has been hard to focus on football but he returned to the day job on Saturday and, having scored, decided then was the moment to pay tribute. \u201cWe have my girlfriend\u2019s brother, Conor Fulford, living with us and he\u2019s been getting into me saying you need a celebration, you need to do something for my mum,\u201d Albrighton said. \u201cChloe\u2019s also been saying that her mum\u2019s been up there putting a few things right and she definitely helped me out there today. I can\u2019t thank everyone enough for the way my family have been treated. The support we\u2019ve had has been unbelievable. I wouldn\u2019t wish what happened to us on anybody else and it makes you look at life in a different way. You think about what is and isn\u2019t important. I\u2019ll see my family now and they will be happy, which is the best thing in the world.\u201d Albrighton\u2019s goal not only put the cap on an exhilarating Leicester performance but also a hugely encouraging one by the player himself. Stationed on the left of a four-man midfield, he was a constant outlet and assisted the opening two goals, with Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez heading in two well delivered right-footed crosses. That right foot was also to thank for Albrighton\u2019s 66th-minute finish \u2013 alongside some poor Sunderland defending and a missed offside call by the referee\u2019s assistant \u2013 and the feeling after this contest was that, alongside his team-mates, Albrighton is determined to maintain last season\u2019s relegation-defying momentum. The winger was an important element of the escape, starting each of Leicester\u2019s final eight games of the campaign, of which they won six, and proving that the potential he displayed after stepping up from Aston Villa\u2019s youth academy into their first team in 2009 had not vanished. That was certainly the feeling after he was released in May 2014 and struggled to make an impact at Leicester having joined them shortly after. But he eventually established himself in the first team and by the end of last season was being spoken of as someone who had \u201cinspirational\u201d qualities by the then manager, Nigel Pearson. Pearson\u2019s successor, Claudio Ranieri, stuck by the player and on Saturday\u2019s evidence the decision was a wise one. \u201cI have always said that, if I can get a run of games, then my performances will come,\u201d said Albrighton. It says much about Leicester\u2019s performance here that Albrighton was not their standout performer. On the other flank Mahrez was outstanding, while Vardy played with his usual zest. Shinji Okazaki also caught the eye in the No10 role while in central midfield, Andy King and Danny Drinkwater played with a level of intensity and intelligence which suggests the loss of Esteban Cambiasso will not be as devastating as first assumed. If it was dream start, then, for Ranieri, for Dick Advocaat here was a reminder of the gruelling challenges that come with being the Sunderland manager. Defensively they were a shambles yet again \u2013 and lucky to find themselves only 3-0 down at half-time \u2013 while in attack there was little urgency or nous. Jermain Defoe\u2019s well-taken finish on the hour mark and Steven Fletcher\u2019s header to make it 4-2 on 71 minutes were all the 3,000 away fans had to cheer about. \u201cThe whole team was not in the game, and that gives me a big concern,\u201d said Advocaat. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any positives.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
