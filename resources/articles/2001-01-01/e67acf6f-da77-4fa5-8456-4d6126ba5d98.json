It may often not know, at first, what to think itself. It has little guiding ideology. It often seeks the opinion of focus groups - tiny minorities raised to the level of universal science - before deciding what exactly to do about even the biggest issues in the fields of crime, or schooling, or healthcare, or the euro. But other minorities are not so exalted. Once the hesitations of the New Labour mind have been settled, dissenters have to be marginalised. This paradox, of uncertainty coexisting with intolerance, is the unique spectacle New Labour has brought to British politics. The intolerance doesn't invariably start at the top. The determination to ban hunting with dogs seems to be mainly an impulse springing from the urban grass-roots. Its intransigence is a way of compensating for the absence of moral compass in many other areas. It sweeps aside all arguments there might be about the science, the economics, the social costs, the rural consequences and the libertarian price with a Jacobin insistence that such quibbling cannot be permitted to override the class reasons to abolish hunting or the hypocritical assertion that the issue is all about animal pain. On each of those aspects, as the Burns report showed, there is much to be said on both sides. There is no conclusive case either way on the science, the economics, the social costs or the rural consequences of a ban. The liberty question, on the other hand, is extremely clear. In the absence of a conclusive case for abolishing a sport that has been part of British country life for centuries and is harmless to the majority who rail against it, the libertarian case should be decisive. If, that is, the politicians in whose hands the decision rests have a secure grasp on the rights of minorities. Not only does New Labour, as we will see when it votes tomorrow, wallow in scorn for the hunting minority, so do the Liberal Democrats, whose official position, declared by Simon Hughes with blind indifference to anything recognisable as liberalism, is for a ban. A few cabinet ministers, to their credit, do not go that far. Jack Straw and Robin Cook won't vote for a ban. But they will then find themselves immersed in a larger issue, where their instincts are unlikely to be so reliable. For the hunting bill, though nodded through by the last-gasp class-warriors of the Commons, will be stalled in the Lords. This is part of the plan. Let the warriors have their red meat in the Commons, but then recognise that the Lords will stop it being finally devoured before the election, thus perhaps giving hope to rural voters that the hunt may in fact survive. Fat chance. But another casus belli will be in place for a much more serious onslaught, against the second chamber. This is a case of intolerance at the very top. Mr Blair is committed to a second stage of reform of the Lords, which has been much debated. It is an extremely thorny issue, on which it was always possible nothing further would be done. The manifesto needs to declare what shape an intended reform will take, and there are voices gathering to press for something more radical than even the copious discussions of the past three years have envisaged. With the second chamber, the choice for any democrat has to lie between making it more legitimate or less potent. So far, Labour has taken, however mildly, the legitimacy option. By excluding most hereditary peers, and preparing to reduce the control of political patronage over new life peers, it has given the Lords the appearance of modernity. Largely bogus though this is, it has been embraced to some effect by the peerage. They have grown stroppy in their obstructions and pious about their rights. In the last session they stopped some measures, like the bill to limit jury trial, and, by exerting incessant pressure on the government's timetable, amended several others. So legitimacy has its costs for government. It also raises the hideous question of what to do next. An elected element, however small, would only make legitimacy more of a pain. The other day Mr Blair reacted with severity to the notion that the Lords should be anything more than a \"revising\" chamber, in terms that made clear his resistance to it being a rival to the Commons. He spoke not just against anything like equality between the houses, but, it seemed, against the smallest degree of even temporary equivalence - which is what the Lords can now claim when exercising their modest powers to delay measures and sometimes, depending on the timetable, kill them. What's therefore under discussion is the impotence option. Why not reduce the Lords' powers still further, to ensure it can't do the kind of things it did as the last session was struggling to its end? Why, when you get down to it, should unelected persons ever have decisive influence over the will of the people as represented by a mandated government? Isn't it time, in all contemporary truth, to deploy the Lords as a forum to which revision work may be subcontracted, but to insist that, if ever its revisions displeased the government, they could simply be chucked away? Since we do not plan to make the Lords more legitimate, how can we tolerate the defiling of democracy that is represented by its power? A fair number of New Labourites would like to follow this logic. It would bring the attractions of single-chamber government without the odium of openly introducing one. There might be a second-chamber recruitment problem later. Meanwhile most of the peerage already present would be happy with their gongs, and any opposition the Commons might offer to serious Lords reform would be neutered at a stroke. Only a government with an impaired sense of constitutional propriety could even contemplate such a scheme. New Labour may balk at trying to carry it through. In the end, the party might prefer the humiliation of failing to reform House of Lords' membership to the outrage of liquidating its powers. But such liquidation would be consistent with the traits to be seen in a political movement which is already in the throes of shifting from inferiority complex to arrogant self-regard, as a product of its impending second election victory. For power does corrupt. Until now, New Labour has thought of its power as contingent. Soon that phase will be over. The government is full of good and honest political workers. But they see their task as urgent, blocked by a thousand obstacles, one of which surely need no longer be an undemocratic second chamber. They can't believe such a place might sometimes be wiser than they are. They don't easily see the need for checks and balances to the onward march of their well-meaning project.Already having more executive power than any government in the western world, they are impatient for more. If they get another large majority, the issue would seem to be: is there anywhere the hounds will be let loose? hugoyoung@compuserve.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
