But the book makes it abundantly clear that in spite of their alarmingly growing numbers - in a dozen years' time half the population will be over 50 - the old have far too little say in what happens to them and to the things that affect them. Exhaustively researched and cogently written, it sets out all the ways in which the old in Britain get a raw deal and the overwhelming case for the growth of a powerful grey power lobby. The manifesto and chapter headings say things like \"Don't waste my skills and experience\", \"Don't trap me at home because there are no loos or seats\", \"Don't force me into a care home\", \"Don't treat those who look after me like rubbish\" and so on. Apparently not only are things pretty rotten for old people, but they've been getting worse (though many of the changes had nothing particularly to do with age when they were brought in). There are fewer park-keepers so open green spaces are more scary; out-of-town supermarkets have often knocked out small local shops; convalescent homes have been closed; rural buses run only on alternate Tuesdays, if then; and it is the old who are most affected, their lives circumscribed. Two million old people never see anyone more than once a week; 32 people die alone at home every day; while the way they are often treated in care homes would cause a national scandal if it was happening to children. The darkest chapters describe what happens to old people when they get ill. There are tales of them being left to soil their beds because the nurses haven't got time to take them to the lavatory, of meals left uneaten because no one puts the food within reach, let alone into their mouths. Polyclinics threaten to undermine the continuity of care that old people need, and there are grim statistics about the extent to which they aren't offered the treatments that would be standard for anyone younger - though I am not sure that the author or Age Concern make a convincing case for old people always being given exactly the same treatment as younger ones regardless of age. As the book points out, in America they overtreat the old, giving them painful and debilitating treatments right up to the hour of death. Julia Neuberger is spot on when she is describing what the old want and need. Unfortunately, it is a lot easier to describe what should be done than to work out how it should be provided. Sometimes the remedy lies with government action - for example, extending grants for older people to attend courses, which have been reduced just when they ought to have been increased. Government, too, can make it illegal to retire people on age grounds alone, or - more usefully - raise the usual retirement and pension age; but that won't help the vast numbers on short-term contracts or whose firms are forced to make redundancies or go broke. If something is publicly run, angry voters and lobbying may achieve goals; but shifting things that are commercially run is different. Care assistants ought to be better paid, for sure, but how do you enforce that when 600 care homes are closing down because they can't make ends meet? The way the old appear - or don't appear - in the media is absurd, but it isn't easily remedied. You can think it idiotic that the BBC discontinued Moira Stuart's contract, but unless the old are recognised as a formidable market, and one which wants to see itself on screen (I'm not sure that Bruce Forsyth really helps here), most TV will go on being dominated by the young and fair. Old people, women especially, don't think the fashion trade gives them what they want, but anyone who can remember utility clothing (as we old can) would hardly welcome a government directive on the matter. So the book is more about what should be done than exactly how we're going to make it happen. But there are some extremely sensible suggestions - for example that there should be local standing panels of people over 70, elected by other seniors, to scrutinise all planning decisions, or that more older people should help poor readers in schools or immigrants with English. In Richmond, businesses have agreed to let the public use their loos in exchange for a maintenance contribution from the council. Volunteering, as used by the National Trust, for example, gets a good press, and schemes like Homeshare, where someone can be half-tenant, half-semi-carer, are cited, as are some foreign solutions. Co-housing is growing in Holland, and Germany hires prostitutes as caregivers - \"they are good at handling people and have no fear of physical contact\". The book's main aim is to alter the climate in which the old are perceived, and give chapter and verse to a growing and increasingly insistent discontent. It will not set the pensioners marching on Westminster with their pitchforks; that will take more intemperate and fiery evangelists. But it provides a thoroughly researched and clearly argued case for this section of the populace to stop taking things lying down and turn themselves into a formidable grey lobby. I hope they do. \u00b7 Katharine Whitehorn's Selective Memory is published by Virago.
