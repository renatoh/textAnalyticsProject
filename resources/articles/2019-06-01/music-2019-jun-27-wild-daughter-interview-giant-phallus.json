And suggests why there\u2019s quite a buzz for when said runaway train hits the ICA for a quite unlikely gig. Entitled The Moon Sextiles the Sun, it promises a night of performance and video art based around themes of \u201cdesire, addiction and gender fuckery\u201d. Joining the scuzzy, Suicide and Cramps-inspired rock\u2019n\u2019roll of Wild Daughter on the bill will be Melbourne\u2019s Spike Fuck, a transgender artist who claims to have invented the genre \u201csmackwave\u201d, and Berlin\u2019s Die H\u00e4sslichen V\u00f6gel, who refuse to record or release any music. Jeanette has even designed a new phallus for the event: \u201cInspired by Tatsumi Hijikata,\u201d he says, referring to one of the founders of Japanese butoh dancing. \u201cI saw a picture of him wearing this giant gold cock in the early 1960s \u2026 so we took that and made it Wild Daughter.\u201d The band emerged after Jeanette had gone through a \u201ctraumatic\u201d period of drug abuse followed by a stint in rehab \u2013 he started making music with poet Stuart McKenzie (guitar) and once the idea took shape bassist Jacob Shaw came on board (along with a drum machine). They\u2019ve funded their music through selling screen-printed Wild Daughter T-shirts (apparently spotted everywhere from Poland to Peru), and gained support from the likes of Pulp\u2019s Steve Mackey and Vivienne Westwood, who they spotted down the front at one show, dancing like she was back at the Sex Pistols. \u201cShe said, \u2018You\u2019re brilliant, the drums, the guitars, everything!\u2019\u201d says McKenzie. \u201cThat was nice, as she\u2019s not known for her generosity in terms of what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Even so, one gig in the band\u2019s history stands out \u2013 the night they played at the Backstreet, London\u2019s oldest gay leather bar. \u201cIt\u2019s the last of the underground, it really is,\u201d says Jeanette, who enthuses about the chains and original Tom of Finland posters on display there. \u201cI\u2019d wanted to to play it for ages, because it\u2019s like walking on to a film set of what a leather bar should be like. It\u2019s not changed since opening in 1985 and, apart from it being a sex club, the energy there doesn\u2019t feel seedy at all.\u201d After convincing the owner to let them play \u2013 which meant relaxing the notoriously strict leather/rubber only dress code and allowing women into the venue for the first time \u2013 they learned more about the club\u2019s origins during the Aids crisis. \u201cHe told us how four of his barman died, literally month after month,\u201d says Jeanette. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing place with beauty, but also a lot of sadness too.\u201d The band ended up writing Carry Me Home for the show, a song they describe as a \u201clove letter to the artists who we lost\u201d such as David Wojnarowicz and Jimmy De Sana. \u201cIt was a dream to be able to do that set,\u201d says Jeanette. \u201cTo see the audience, especially the younger ones, realise that a place like that still exists. It\u2019s literally from another world, another lifetime!\u201d The gig also adhered to their insistence that performance should involve not just great music but also striking visuals \u2013 Jeanette has performed in the past wearing little more than a jock strap and thigh-high boots. \u201cI don\u2019t want to just be Stuart up there with my everyday issues,\u201d says McKenzie. \u201cI want to forget myself, to put on clothes and get that other Stuart out the way!\u201d Jeanette believes that everyone has an urge to dress up. \u201cAlthough I can only speak from my perspective \u2026 I was running around the streets in my mum\u2019s high heels since I was about four years old!\u201d There\u2019ll be new outfits on display at the ICA show, as well as new music \u2013 the band are set to release their new double A-side single Mr G/Brando Bomb, complete with sleeve art by Richard Hawkins depicting an orgiastic fisting scene. There will also, should things go as intended, be a frisson of chemistry with the audience. \u201cIt\u2019s out of your hands where a live show goes,\u201d says McKenzie. \u201cI like going into the audience with the guitar and just ending up like a mass on the floor.\u201d \u201cPeople are gagging for this kind of thing,\u201d agrees Jeanette. \u201cWe\u2019re just giving them what they want.\u201d Wild Daughter play the ICA, London, on Thursday 27 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
