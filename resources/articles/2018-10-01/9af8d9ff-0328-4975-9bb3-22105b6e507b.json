Following on from Paul McGinley and Darren Clarke, Harrington would become the third European captain from the island of Ireland within four Ryder Cups. Harrington, a three-times major champion, was one of Thomas Bj\u00f8rn\u2019s vice-captains as Europe demolished USA 17\u00bd to 10\u00bd at Le Golf National. A meeting of those charged with selecting Bj\u00f8rn\u2019s successor \u2013 including the Dane himself \u2013 is expected before the end of this year with Harrington by far the favoured candidate to lead Europe in Wisconsin. \u201cHe\u2019d be brilliant,\u201d said Bj\u00f8rn when asked about a Harrington captaincy. \u201cHe\u2019s got all the tools and all the knowledge.\u201d There was further backing from Rory McIlroy, Europe\u2019s most high-profile player. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought Padraig would be a good captain in the United States,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cPadraig\u2019s won a lot of golf tournaments over there. He\u2019s won a US PGA Championship. \u201cI think the continuity in the European camp, having all these vice-captains this year and preparing for captaincy down the road has been a huge foundation of why we\u2019ve been so good.\u201d Another of Bj\u00f8rn\u2019s deputies, Lee Westwood, initially said he had targeted 2020 for a captaincy tilt but it is thought the Englishman would now prefer to wait until the Ryder Cup scheduled for Italy two years later. After earlier expressing an element of reluctancy about a captain\u2019s role Harrington now says he is keen to lead Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting one because I wouldn\u2019t do it without a certain trepidation because it\u2019s not easy, it really isn\u2019t easy,\u201d said the 47-year-old. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough, tough job. But on balance yes, I want to be a Ryder Cup captain at some stage.\u201d The 47-year-old Bj\u00f8rn is yet to decide whether to continue with his playing career or change path at the end of what he described as an intense captaincy journey. \u201cI\u2019m quite looking forward to finding something to do and then put my time and effort into that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has been amazing. It\u2019s been fun. It\u2019s been testing. \u201cI learned a lot about myself in the process as well, which has been great. As much as you\u2019re there to do it for other people, and it is for those 12, you are also there to learn things about yourself and your own development and I\u2019ve enjoyed it. \u201cI learned how to work with people, and that\u2019s not easy when you\u2019re an individual sportsman. You\u2019re used to getting your own way a lot, and in this, there\u2019s a lot of people involved that you have to work with. You learn a lot about that. So I want to go in and take a bit of time and figure out what I\u2019m going to do next.\u201d Bj\u00f8rn offered a defence of Jim Furyk, the defeated US captain who came under attack from one of his own players, Patrick Reed, in the Ryder Cup aftermath. Reed, Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka were among an American contingent who belatedly joined the victory party at the team hotel, as is customary. It has since emerged that Johnson and Koepka had to be separated following a flare-up. \u201cJim has been great,\u201d Bj\u00f8rn said. \u201cHe\u2019s a top guy. He\u2019s a gentleman in everything he does and that\u2019s a relationship I\u2019ve had with him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what goes on inside their team room. I can\u2019t make any comments on it because I actually don\u2019t know. I saw Brooks and Dustin last night and they were fine. Patrick came in, as well, and there were no comments about this, that and the other. From where I sit I can only say it looks like they got on fine and it was OK. If there was something, it\u2019s for Jim to answer or the players.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
