Chelsea take on Liverpool in the weekend\u2019s most anticipated fixture but the manager prefaced it by opening up a new line of complaint against his employers, over the contract of Thibaut Courtois, while continuing to air grievances over a congested fixture list. The Chelsea goalkeeper is under contract at Stamford Bridge until the end of next season but the player Conte believes will be \u201cthe best in the world\u201d said this week there has been no progress on a new deal and he is happy to wait until the end of the season to pursue discussions. When asked to comment on Courtois\u2019 remarks in his pre-match press conference, Conte said the onus lay on the club to fix the situation. \u201cI must be honest, I think that this question is for the club, not for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to give my opinion about technical decisions. It is important for the club to face this issue, to face this contract with Courtois. For sure I can tell that Courtois is one of the best, maybe the best goalkeeper in the world, and he is a player who is very important for Chelsea. I can tell this. But for sure the renewal is a task for the club. \u201cIf a big player decides to not sign a new contract it is difficult for a club to try to avoid this issue,\u201d Conte went on. \u201cBut at the same time I think there is space to try to deal with the issue and try to solve the situation. Maybe [Alexis] S\u00e1nchez and [Mesut] \u00d6zil they are finishing their contracts with Arsenal and it is not simple but every club has to try solve the situations.\u201d Chelsea made a 6,000-mile round trip to Azerbaijan in midweek, touching down in London only at the second time of asking because of bad weather. But while he admitted to being disconcerted by these events Conte was more keen to repeat his insistence that Chelsea have been unfairly done by in the allocation of fixtures. \u201cIt was a lot of wind and we tried to land the first time but it was impossible,\u201d said Conte, whose side were 4-0 winners against Qarabag, of the emergency landing at Gatwick. \u201cThen the captain tried again and the second time it was positive. As you know in these circumstances you feel a bit afraid, you are a bit scared, but the captain was very good. \u201cIt was a problem to land. I think that to get to your house at 6am is not simple. It\u2019s not simple then to rest and recover for only one day and to prepare for a big game. It\u2019s not right, I must be honest. But we have to do it and today we had a good training session and we tried to prepare the game very well.\u201d Conte says he has asked his club to do what they can to ensure such a compressed fixture schedule does not recur but says he has not made a complaint to the Premier League. The Italian was also critical after Chelsea faced Manchester City in the Premier League in September, two days after returning from a Champions League away fixture with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. \u201cI tried to speak with my club about this problem and to pay more attention for the future,\u201d Conte said. \u201cThis is not the first time. In only one month and a half we have had two situations and, also, it was before big games, against Manchester City and now against Liverpool. \u201cI think [the Premier League] have to pay more attention and try to give the same possibilities to all teams to recover in the right way, in the same way, and not to try to create a problem for only one team. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we will speak to the Premier League but the situation is really clear. Everyone can tell this. Not because I want to complain,\u201d the Chelsea manager said. Conte and his squad got back on a plane on Friday afternoon to fly to Merseyside for their Saturday teatime fixture at Anfield. Asked whether his players would be jaded after their travelling experience, Conte said: \u201cI think that we must be ready. Ready to play a big game against Liverpool. I don\u2019t want to give excuses or alibis and it is the same for the players. \u201cFor sure it won\u2019t be easy facing a really good team, a strong team, especially at home. Their fans push them a lot but at the same time we have to try to do our best.\u201d Conte\u2019s fixture frustration has not gone unnoticed by his rival, J\u00fcrgen Klopp. The Liverpool manager, described by Conte as a coach similar to himself in his \u201cintensity and passion\u201d for the game, said his Chelsea counterpart can have few complaints over fixture scheduling when Chelsea have been granted a lenient festive period for the second season running. Klopp claims Chelsea have a major advantage in playing on 30 December and 3 January, when most clubs will play on the 30 December and 1 January. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cI really get what Antonio is talking about but maybe he forgot they had the best Christmas schedule last year. Everyone played every two days and they had 12 days to play three games. \u201cIt is the same situation this year and I don\u2019t know how the Premier League will explain this.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
