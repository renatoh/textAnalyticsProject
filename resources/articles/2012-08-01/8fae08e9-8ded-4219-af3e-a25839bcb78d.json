At the last count, 12 of Britain's gold medals, and 22 of the gold medallists, came from state schools. It is the same, in differing proportions, for silver and bronze medallists. The debate sparked by Lord Moynihan, the chairman of the British Olympic Association, when he said how unacceptable it was that half of the British medallists in Beijing came from private schools, applies less to the 2012 games and even less to the weekend's trove of gold medallists. Their stories undermine the message that sporting success is a reserve of class or privilege. The moral of Bradley Wiggins's or Jessica Ennis's or Mo Farah's personal struggles to become and stay champions is that ordinary people can do extraordinary things. None the less, Lord Moynihan hit a nerve, even if it is one that rebounds \u2013 largely, but not wholly \u2013 on his own Conservative party. Try as the Daily Mail might to find a link between state education and \"any philosophy that is against competition\" \u2013 in 1987 the Thatcher government commissioned an inquiry into the issue \u2013 there is scant evidence to back up this neat little theory. The total number of British pupils taking part in competitive sports has risen sharply. A link is more likely to lie between sporting achievement and universal access to modern sporting facilities. If both Tory and Labour governments had not been in such a rush to encourage cash-strapped councils to sell off school playing fields, or strong-arm them into PFI projects of dubious merit and unending cost; if future Olympic swimming hopefuls did not now have to travel the length of London to find a 50m length pool to practise in; if the prices of sporting facilities up and down the country were not so exorbitant, politicians of all colours would be in a better position to claim that sports were for all. But that is far from the case. If private schools have something to sell to a growing market of parents, it is not just their comparatively lavish facilities for sport as well as for music and drama. It is plainly also lower pupil-teacher ratios. The same message comes across again and again: if sports were truly integrated into the curriculum, if more schools had teaching staffs large and motivated enough, rich seams of educational benefit are there to be found in sport which lie across the curriculum \u2013 in numeracy, science, health education, learning ability, concentration, application, to take just a few. Slashing sports funding by 60% has a price. Even though it may be alleviated by the coalition government's plan to divert the majority of Sport England's budget into youth sport and a plan to link schools with clubs, that price is generally paid for by pupils, particularly in primary schools. The result of trying to backfill the cuts, of announcing a policy and performing a sharp left turn when the clamour gets too much, is that sports education funding has become over-bureaucratic, multi-agency, and with competing agendas. It needs an overhaul. If any politician ought to be filmed dangling from a wire at the Olympic Park it is not Boris Johnson but Michael Gove. The 2012 Olympics and Saturday's golden triumphs speak to a gigantic disconnect. There is achievement, both individual and collective, capable of lighting up a whole nation, and even defining it. For a brief fortnight it has become British to win. Followed by what? Sports return to their traditionally marginalised place in government policy. Tony Blair may struggle to justify the \u00a39bn price tag of public investment in the 2012 Olympics, but in setting up a small-scale sports foundation in the north-east of England to train coaches and volunteers, he is right to admit that he is sitting in a lonely gap between government, sports organisations and the grassroots. He won the Olympics on a promise to put sports at the heart of health and education policy. When he has finished basking in its reflected glory, David Cameron should honour that promise by declaring that sport is back at the heart of his education policy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
