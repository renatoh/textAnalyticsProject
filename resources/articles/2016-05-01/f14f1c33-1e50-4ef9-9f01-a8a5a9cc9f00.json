The British Paraorchestra is the world\u2019s first large-scale professional ensemble for musicians with disabilities, founded by conductor Charles Hazlewood in 2012, the same year they performed with Coldplay at the London Paralympics closing ceremony. On the same day, the South-West Open Youth Orchestra will also be appearing in Bristol. It works with young disabled musicians who play a range of instruments, including a custom-made digital device called a Clarion that can be controlled simply by the movement of a musician\u2019s eyes. Bradley Warwick, who has cerebral palsy, plays this instrument and says: \u201cBeing part of an orchestra is new to me. I love it, and feel a kind of freedom and belonging. Disability should never be a barrier to enjoying music and getting involved.\u201d Just as the Paralympics have done much to change perceptions of disabled people, so ensembles such as the British Paraorchestra and the South-West Open Youth Orchestra are shifting attitudes by creating a platform for gifted disabled musicians to perform and excel. Coincidentally, emails promoting these examples of positive thinking around disability arrived in my inbox last week, alongside others expressing disappointment at a fictional portrayal of disability \u2013 the forthcoming film Me Before You \u2013 and at the Observer\u2019s coverage of its imminent release. Mawkishly headlined \u201cNot just a tearjerker: why a tale of love and disability will make us think as well as weep\u201d, the preview piece outlined something of the plot of the film, based on the novel of the same name by the British author JoJo Moyes, and interviewed its director, Thea Sharrock. The story revolves around Will Traynor, a quadriplegic former high-flying banker, played by Sam Claflin, and his carer, Lou, played by Emilia Clarke, and attempts to tackle head-on the difficult issue of disability and voluntary euthanasia. Postings on Facebook and emails sent to me were angry at the paper\u2019s claim that Sharrock \u201c\u2026 believes the film offers a chance to pause and reflect on the real value of life \u2026 focusing on its serious central issue: what might make life worth living if you are confined to a wheelchair?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not 1970 any more,\u201d wrote one reader. \u201cShould that really even be a question? We [disabled people] are not some alien species.\u201d She joined others who pointed out that our style guide had long ago outlawed the term \u201cconfined to a wheelchair\u201d. Another wrote: \u201cWhat is this question saying? Wheelchair users might as well go and kill themselves? I am a wheelchair user. My wheelchair does not confine me; it gives me independence.\u201d Some readers believed the paper let the director off lightly when she talked of the decision not to cast a disabled actor as Traynor. \u201cDisabled actors will not become mainstream if they are never cast!,\u201d wrote one, adding: \u201cSharrock was also not challenged when she says very harmful things like \u2018My nephew is in a wheelchair and I hope he will be pleased to see this shown in a way that does not make audiences too uncomfortable. If we had shown Will being taken in and out of his chair, or put in a hoist over a bath, the impression we would give is of difficulty. I wanted to make it more normal.\u2019 Most of us want to see our lives on screen. For us they are normal, and more people seeing those aspects helps to normalise them rather than making them some exotic secret.\u201d The reader felt the paper should have gone further into what she called the \u201creal issue\u201d: Sharrock had made a film about disabled people as a non-disabled person, based on a book written by a non-disabled person, not starring any disabled people, for a mainly non-disabled audience. \u201cI don\u2019t think the message that committing suicide so my partner doesn\u2019t have to live with a wheelchair user is particularly romantic. In fact, I\u2019d go so far as to suggest it\u2019s pretty harmful for people like me, especially those newly adjusting to life as a disabled person. You could have covered the multitude of deep problems in this film. I\u2019m not against discussing death and euthanasia, but when it is one of the key plotlines it becomes harmful. I think that would have been far more worthy of investigation.\u201d It\u2019s hard to disagree with the reader\u2019s conclusion that, in future, editors should take a long look at pieces they commission which involve disabled people and ask themselves whether they are unwittingly propping up outdated and harmful stereotypes. observer.readers@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
