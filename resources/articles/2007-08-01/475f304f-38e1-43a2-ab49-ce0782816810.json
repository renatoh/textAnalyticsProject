Goodbye. Goodbye. How I long for civilisation. How I long for ...? Do you know what I long for? Breakfast. My coffee at breakfast. Oh yes. A really good cup of coffee. And a little pastry or - if I'm watching my figure - no little pastry. But always coffee. Oh yes. And to say to the man in the pastry shop \"Lovely weather\" or \"Planning a holiday?\" or \"How are the kids?\" because that's what civilisation means. At the end of the day, that's what makes us civilised. Those little words as he sells me a pastry and I buy a pastry. It is time to heal in my family. My little boy has been troubled. At first he was drawing pictures of people with no heads. Why? We couldn't tell. Then just one person. The soldier with no head. And then he told us the soldier with no head was coming into his room. He wet the bed. This is what war does to a child. My child. But now I'm going to play with him and there'll be theme parks and we'll go to the biggest toy warehouse and I'll say \"anything, anything you want\" and we'll drive home and there will be food and love. It must be possible to get over this war. I believe it must. If I didn't believe in healing well I wouldn't ... I have to believe in healing. It was an empty relationship with my wife. I see that now. Oh we talked all the time about the price of our house and booking for the theatre and, and, and politics and so on. But actually somehow very empty. That's all changing now. So much love from now - from now everything is love. Ah the plane is ready. Finally we're going home. We're seeing home. At last. At last. At last. Home. STOP! THE BATTLE IS NOT OVER YET. STOP! THE BATTLE STILL RAGES! No. STOP! ANOTHER COUNTRY. ANOTHER COUNTRY WHICH IS THE CRADLE OF HATE. ANOTHER COUNTRY WHICH WILL DESTROY THE CIVILISED WORLD. No please. STOP! ANOTHER COUNTRY WHERE THERE IS NO FREEDOM TO SPEAK, NO DEMOCRACY, A PLACE OF TORTURE AND FEAR. I want to go home please. I miss my wife so much please. STOP! ANOTHER COUNTRY WHICH BREAKS EVERY INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT. ANOTHER COUNTRY TO WHOM FAIR WARNING WAS GIVEN. My son has a girlfriend. He's messaged me. Please I must see my son's girlfriend at least please. THIS IS THE NEXT WAR. THIS IS THE NEXT INVASION. YOU WILL NOT RETURN HOME. YOU WILL INVADE. STAND BY TO INVADE. Please we are so tired please we have to stop please. Look. We have lived these last few years with bombs and mines. We lost track of who was an enemy and who was a friend. We are so lonely. We miss our families. We miss ... so stupid but we miss all the tiny things about our lives, things ... gardens, coffee, friends, a DVD with a child. We can't go on without these things. Yes of course we believe in yes - all the core values - freedom democracy yes - but we can't...? How long is this going on? How long? \u00a9 Mark Ravenhill 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
