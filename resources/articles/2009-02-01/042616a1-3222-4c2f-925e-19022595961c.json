It will be Ireland's first trip to Italy since they narrowly missed out on the Six Nations championship in 2007 and many fans have begun to hope that this year the team could go one stage further. \"I suppose we don't want to mess up now, having got a great win,\" said Wallace. \"We know what a big challenge it's going to be this weekend going down to Rome and how physical they play the game. Every year they take a couple of scalps. We don't want to be the ones this year. Having said that they have quality players in their team, they've huge experience as well in their pack in all the forward positions. It's going to be a tough challenge. \"There is a sense that things are going well and that maybe we can accomplish something this year that we haven't done for a very long time in Ireland.\" Wallace has been on in excellent form for both Munster and Ireland and is strongly favoured to claim the British and Irish Lions No7 Test shirt for the tour to South Africa this summer. However, he was relatively quiet against the French as his fellow back-row Jamie Heaslip stole the attention with a vital try. \"I was quiet in terms of attack and not getting my hands on the ball. Looking back there wasn't a huge amount of chances or opportunities to get my hands on the ball,\" he said. \"The French defended very well, but Jamie (Heaslip) was given a bit of room and made some of his own. You'll never get all of the three back-row forwards getting a lot of ball in hand, but we were quite happy to see Jamie do what he did so well.\" Ireland scored eight tries in a 51-24 win on their last visit to the Stadio Flaminio in 2007 but were denied a first title since 1985 when France scored a late, contested try in their match against Scotland. \"It was very disappointing,\" Wallace recalled. \"We were on a bit of a high from the game. We were a small bit disappointed in the dressing-room that we had leaked a couple of tries but I think it was that kind of game where there was a bit more open running. \"Watching France and Scotland then in the hotel was obviously very tense - everyone was in there, including supporters who were watching it on TV. You just got a sense that France had the momentum and were going to do it. I think the power on the TV went at one stage as they were very close to the line. It added to it. You kick yourself over chances missed like that,\" he said. \"You definitely do think about it and talk about it with other players. It's a big regret and I suppose that's something you use to drive yourself on. I think there is a feeling in the team that we have had regrets and we don't want to have that feeling again. Also as the team ages and some guys get closer to retiring, that's one of the feelings you don't want to be left with - the feeling of regret and having come close to achieving something but not quite having done it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
