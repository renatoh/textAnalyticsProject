For there is every chance the US under President Obama and his team could fulfil some of Europe's key demands for multinational cooperation \u2013 and demand cooperation and payback in return. The George W Bush years were difficult, of that there is no doubt in Brussels, not least because a disproportionate amount of time was spent establishing the lines of transatlantic disagreement \u2013 especially over the core global security issues of Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and the Middle East. In fact, the blatant and sometimes extreme differences between the US and the EU \u2013 and many of the EU states in Nato \u2013 have become part of the narrative of each of these problematic areas. From the European perspective, all four issues \u2013 and various others \u2013 can be boiled down to the EU holding the line of multilateralism and international law, and the US holding the line of sole superpower and force. This was a case of subliminal angels and devils rather than Robert Kagan's thesis about Mars (Americans) and Venus (Europeans) \u2013 and a convenient stance that demanded much rhetoric but little action. But now it may be over. First, to judge by Hillary Clinton's confirmation statement, the EU is about to have a strong competitor on politically correct rhetoric. There was a lot less of the sole superpower and a lot more of the reaching out and multilateralism. Second, much has been made of the incoming Obama team focusing on internal issues due to the massive economic crisis, but little note has been taken of the longer-term implications of both the focus and the crisis: the Obama team wants to get a number of issues off the table, or at least basically recast, and it wants somebody else to pay for a lot of it. Using absolutely charming rhetoric, a display of power and a modicum of force, the US could be about to get just that \u2013 and change every single equation. There is already an agreement for the US to slowly leave Iraq, so other than quibble over dates and the possibility of bringing this forward, the EU can no longer use it as an excuse for keeping well away. Indeed, it may find itself vulnerable to US demands that it step up civilian assistance in training and programmes \u2013 Iraq has enough money of its own, so it needs no EU donations \u2013 to ensure the entrenchment of civil society. Brussels is abuzz with certainty that Obama will demand more troops for the international security assistance force, the Nato mission in Afghanistan \u2013 and that the Europeans will have difficulty responding favourably, thereby getting off to a difficult start with this apparently welcome new president. But he may surprise the buzz. Since Iraq is to be drawn down, and Obama has already announced that Afghanistan is a priority and he will send more troops there, he may simply ask the EU to put its money and will where its mouth is and pay a lot more for civilian reconstruction and police and security training. Worse still, there may also be a request to finally enable the much-needed EU-Nato cooperation on the ground, which is perennially blocked due to disagreements over Cyprus (Turkey refuses to accept any EU action since it involves Cyprus, and the EU refuses to act without unanimity). It is unclear whether Obama will really meet the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but it is clear there is every intention of changing the ground rules of enmity \u2013 at least at the rhetorical level, with an emphasis on diplomacy. Objecting to such a stance would be a bizarre move for the EU to take, leaving it with little choice other than at least to observe and possibly to follow, but under US leadership. The biggest unknown may be the Middle East: following the Gaza offensive, and using the contrast with the outgoing administration, team Obama may drive Israel to agree on fundamental change, including on settlements and borders as against the EU paying for a substantive part of the reconstruction \u2013 which, to be fair, it would have anyway \u2013 and a more coordinated and coherent stance across the region. All this could be a big shock to Europeans, who tend to see themselves as having held the high moral ground for the past eight years. It may be time for them to face reality and realise that they deserve little credit for this stance. The world is a worse place than it was eight years ago, and while the US may have led on resolving problems with force, the EU cannot be said to have countered with initiatives on peace. Moreover, its leaders used the popular dislike of the Bush administration \u2013 rather than the US as a whole \u2013 to do little or nothing other than wring hands, disapprove, make politically correct statements and dole out billions in cash rather than take, and then pursue, principled and useful strategies. Hopefully for us all the arrival of President Obama and his team will force some change: it would be a sin to not use such an opportunity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
