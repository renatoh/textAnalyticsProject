Chef David Bennett (ex-the Walnut Tree in its Taruschio days) turns out delicious Mediterraneaninfluenced food for around \u00a325 a head. Best deals are the early lunch (\u00a39.95 for, say, parmesan tart followed by cod with basil sauce) or dinner (\u00a314.95 for three courses with a glass of wine). Jockey, Baughton, Earls Croome, Worcestershire (01684 592 153) It's been wildly busy in the few weeks since Mark Welsh and Tony Lumb took over this gastropub convenient for the M50 (junction 1). Totally revamped, right down to sofas and chandeliers in the ladies' loo, it's now open all day and obliges customers with anything they fancy, from a jacket potato (fresh crab sandwich and a glass of wine, \u00a36.50) to red snapper with chili, garlic and citrus oil. County, 13 The Green, Aycliffe Village, County Durham (01325 312 273) At lunch, this pretty restaurant overlooking the village green serves 'pub-oriented' food to business people too busy for three leisurely courses. Liver and bacon, sausages and mash, curry and salads are the style, and everything but rib-eye steak costs under a tenner. In the evenings, County is serious dining territory - witness crispy duck with rosemary and black pudding rosti, stir-fry veg and an orange Maltese sauce. Turn off the A1(M) at junction 59."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
