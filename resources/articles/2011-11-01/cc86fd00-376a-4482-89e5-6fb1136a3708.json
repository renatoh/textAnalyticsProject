The 72-year-old Italian continues to bask in the achievement of leading the squad to next summer's European Championship after the 5-1 aggregate play-off victory over Estonia. It will be the first time Ireland have competed at a major finals since the 2002 World Cup. Trapattoni's deal is due to expire when Ireland's Euro 2012 participation finishes but he is happy that an agreement has been reached in principle for him to continue into the next campaign. He has met the businessman Denis O'Brien, who pays half his \u00a31.7m salary, and Trapattoni and the Football Association of Ireland are confident that the arrangement will be prolonged. Trapattoni has long made it plain that he wants to remain in the post and build on the progress that he has overseen, although he accepted that failure to qualify for next summer's finals would have dramatically altered the landscape. \"It's only a formality,\" Trapattoni said. \"It's not about money. I have met Denis O'Brien. He and the other sponsors support us. It's about appreciating our job. \"We have always said that we didn't want to put pressure on the FAI until qualification was sorted out. We have only lost two games in two qualifying campaigns. We have done our job well until now. The FAI and the Irish people asked us [to qualify] and we have answered perfectly, together with the players, with great professionalism. \"I say, with a little arrogance, that we deserve this agreement. We deserve to continue because in the future, we can make good results. I believe in this squad.\" Trapattoni hinted that he would like the new contract to be for four years, which would take him up to the next European Championship. \"First, I have health,\" he said. \"And surely, I will still have the enthusiasm.\" And he gave his blessing to the idea of his assistant, Marco Tardelli, one day succeeding him. \"I would like the FAI to give him that opportunity.\" Excitement has swept Ireland, with optimism high that the squad can punch above their underdog status. The group of players is so settled that Trapattoni does not envisage making more than a few tweaks for the finals. \"I was not a great player but I played against Eus\u00e9bio, Pel\u00e9 and Cruyff and I became famous because of them,\" Trapattoni said. \"I was the underdog. The media spoke about me but they were the great players. All is possible in football. Manchester United win 30 games out of 38 but in 90 minutes? Why can't we win? Nobody can deny us our dreams. We have to believe.\" The captain, Robbie Keane, has returned to Los Angeles Galaxy to prepare for the end of the MLS season and Sunday's cup final against Houston Dynamos. But he has categorically ruled out the prospect of a loan back to Europe while the MLS is in its close season. \"It may work out better for me, in terms of the Euros,\" Keane said. \"I will take a few weeks off and then get ready. I will be halfway through the MLS season [when Euro 2012 starts], which would be perfect for me.\" Trapattoni has begun to plan Ireland's preparations for the finals, with a friendly against England a strong possibility, although all parties must wait for the Euro 2012 group phase draw in Kiev on 2 December. Trapattoni also indicated that he wanted a pre-tournament training camp with his players."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
