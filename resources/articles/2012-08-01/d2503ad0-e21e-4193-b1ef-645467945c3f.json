In a snapshot scene which turned heads, Tiger Woods approaches Rory McIlroy after finishing a post-round range session. Woods watches McIlroy hit shots for 15 minutes, with the pair clearly on amicable terms. Woods even has a brief frisk through the Northern Irishman's clubs. The exchange was notable because Woods has never been known for such an interest in others; quite the opposite, in fact. McIlroy has long featured on the radar of golf's aristocracy. All of that group, including Woods, could only look on in total admiration as the 23-year-old claimed the second major of his career on Sunday evening. McIlroy's win turned into a procession. As McIlroy added the US PGA Championship to last year's US Open, two questions arose. Just how many major championships can this player win? And is it legitimate to point out McIlroy should already have aspirations of matching the success of Woods \u2013 who has 14 majors to his name \u2013 or even Jack Nicklaus? \"I am just looking for my third,\" insists McIlroy. \"I am not trying to emulate anyone or try to match anyone. I have got my second now which feels unbelievable and I am going to enjoy it and I will be working towards my third and hopefully when I get that I will be working towards my fourth and so on. I just have to enjoy this moment and enjoy getting that second one. \"I know I can do it at the biggest stage and there is no reason why I can't do it again. I already put a lot of emphasis on the majors but I don't think there is any point in putting any more. What I am doing is working pretty well.\" Others are already estimating how far the player from County Down could go. Nick Faldo, Britain's greatest major champion of the modern era, led the glowing praise of McIlroy after the Kiawah success. \"It was just pure perfection,\" Faldo says. \"He just outplayed everybody. \"Rory has a different ability, better than the average bear, when it comes to visualisation, as I always harp on about. You watch the way he looks at things. You watch the way he lines up bunker shots. He's trying to hole them. And he has a special nerve as well. \"The most important thing is to play one major at a time. He now knows the most important thing in his life are the majors and he should do everything to gear his schedule and the rest of his career for the majors.\" McIlroy is already being touted as a potential winner \u2013 or holder \u2013 of all four majors. \"He's got half of them and he's right there,\" Faldo adds. \"You can't predict anything but he now knows and, more importantly, the rest of the field knows that when he is on they might be playing for second place.\" McIlroy's game has unquestionably developed in a short space of time. At the 2010 Open Championship, he opened up with a 63 which increased by 17 shots on Friday as the weather turned rough. Second-round conditions at Kiawah Island also deteriorated but McIlroy kept himself in contention by scoring 75; there were no signs of the youngster attacking holes when there was no scope to do so. It is in matters of the mind, though, that McIlroy feels he has undergone an education. Winning last year's US Open intensified focus on him, as has his relationship with the tennis star Caroline Wozniacki. \"I definitely needed to deal with the expectations every time I came to one of these tournaments,\" he says. \"Not just expectations of other people but expectations of myself. They were heightened since congressional and I was getting frustrated I wasn't living up to them. \"There was a huge learning curve. I think one of the biggest things as well was learning to deal with the scrutiny. It was the first time I have ever had to deal with that so that was something I had to learn and will learn to live with for the rest of my career probably. It is all part of what we do and if I am getting scrutinised like that it means I am doing something right. I don't mind.\" McIlroy's eight-shot US PGA win represented a tournament record margin. He has also returned to the summit of golf's world rankings. \"I wasn't surprised at the way he played because I called it at the Open,\" says JP Fitzgerald, McIlroy's caddie. \"I said: 'The way this guy is hitting the ball he is going to destroy fields.' He was playing that well in practice, I knew if it wasn't going to be that week it would happen soon. \"It's not a surprise to me to see him playing like that\u201a I'm used to seeing him hit great shots in practice, and on the course. He said to me on the last tee\u201a 'we won our first major by eight, let's do it again'. And he gets the birdie to do it. Incredible.\" In the past, Woods was being spoken about in such terms. As Faldo put it: \"At one stage, Tiger was supersonic and trying to be an ordinary guy. Now he is an ordinary guy, trying to be supersonic.\" A more immediate challenge may be fighting off a friendly pretender."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
