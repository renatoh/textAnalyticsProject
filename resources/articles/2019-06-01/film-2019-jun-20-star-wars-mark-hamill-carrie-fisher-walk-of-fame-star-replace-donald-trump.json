Hamill retweeted an article from August 2018 reporting that West Hollywood City Council had voted to remove Trump\u2019s star. Hamill added: \u201cGood riddance! (and I know just who should replace him...) #AStarForCarrie.\u201d As reported at the time, Trump\u2019s star had seen a number of attempts at vandalism, and it was highlighted that a number of popular industry figures, including Fisher, George Clooney and Denzel Washington, do not have stars on the Walk of Fame. However, Hamill appears to be labouring under a misapprehension that Trump\u2019s star is to be removed, or that the council have any power to enforce a removal. The stars are owned and overseen by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which has stated that stars will not be removed due to misconduct of the people they celebrate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
