A virtually inevitable consequence of administration is the enforced shedding of staff. Although Rangers' administrators say their job is to keep the business running, they admit costs have to be cut. A review of income against expenditure is ongoing. It is likely to be next week, at the earliest, before employees learn their fate. Paul Clark, Rangers' joint administrator, said on Thursday: \"This morning I spoke to the club's manager, Ally McCoist, and the playing staff at the club's training complex, Murray Park. I informed them of the process we are now engaged with. I told them that a review of staffing \u2013 including playing staff \u2013 would be necessary as part of the process and would inform them of developments as soon as possible.\" Will Rangers be able to compete in European football next season? Rangers need to qualify for a Uefa club licence \u2013 via the Scottish Football Association \u2013 by 31 March to be permitted entry to Europe. This is a complex issue but, essentially, Rangers face a race against time to prove their finances are in order. Paul Whitehouse, one of Rangers' administrators, said the club are hopeful of producing what are overdue annual accounts to help that situation but that they would be \"heavily audited\". He added: \"We will do everything that we can to meet that deadline. We will do everything that is humanly possible. We understand the importance of that date.\" What is the likelihood of Rangers entering into a company voluntary arrangement to allow them to begin an exit from administration? The administrators appear confident that this will be forthcoming. However, some as yet unclear points are crucial to this. Agreement between 75% of the club's creditors is necessary to process the CVA. The administrators remain unsure of the full value of debt owed to Craig Whyte, the Rangers owner, and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, and what security is attached to all of the club's borrowings. Crucial to this is whether the first-tier tax tribunal between HMRC and Rangers, the result of which is yet to be announced but could land the club a bill for tens of millions of pounds, is incorporated. \"There are mechanisms and means to satisfy, subject to agreement with HMRC, and compromise that debt notwithstanding the amount still unknown,\" said Clark. \"In other words we don't have to wait for the results of the tribunal to start that process.\" In the event of liquidation, what would that entail for Scottish football? A political headache. Speculation and debate is rife about the viability of a newly formed Rangers instantly re-entering the Scottish Premier League. Celtic are known to have serious reservations about such a scenario coming to pass, on the grounds of financial fair play. Nonetheless blunt reality states the commercial interests and scramble for cash among other SPL sides render it almost impossible to envisage any \"newco\" Rangers from being kicked out of the top tier altogether. The administrators have said liquidation is unlikely, though. What is the relationship between Craig Whyte and Duff &amp; Phelps, the club's administrator? Heavy interest has surrounded this arrangement, given that David Grier, a partner in Duff &amp; Phelps, was photographed in the company of Whyte walking into and in the directors' box at Ibrox when Whyte attended his first game as the Rangers owner last May. During Thursday's media conference Clark made a point of addressing this issue. Clark said: \"Late last year Duff &amp; Phelps acquired MCR, a UK-based restructuring and turnaround firm focused on restructuring and insolvency work. \"MCR [formerly Menzies Corporate Restructuring] was asked to provide consultancy advice to Rangers post the takeover of the club last year. Prior to the assistance on Rangers, MCR and Duff &amp; Phelps had not acted for Craig Whyte nor any of his companies. Nor was Craig Whyte ever a director, partner or staff member of MCR. I understand that Mr Whyte has an unrelated business interest called Merchant Corporate Recovery. My firm has no involvement nor association with Merchant Corporate Recovery. \"This work included assessing cost and staff structure, revenue forecasts, liaising with HMRC and options for the club should an insolvency arise. This included concerns in relation to the first tier tax case. \"Our appointment on Tuesday as administrators over Rangers was standard practice by a company facing an insolvency situation. It was approved by the court of session and agreed to by HMRC. \"To be absolutely clear, we act as officers of the court and we are accountable to the court. We have a statutory duty to act in the best interests of creditors and stakeholders and that is what we will do. This administration will be carried out under the most rigorous public scrutiny and will be conducted to the highest professional standards.\" Would McCoist consider walking away? The man himself has said that is not an option he has considered. \"Not at all,\" the manager said. \"Absolutely not at all. This is my club, the same as it is for thousands and thousands of Rangers supporters. We don't do walking away. \"We are in a position at this moment in time where the club is maybe as low as it has been \u2013 possibly ever. \"We have to put our trust and our faith in getting the club to a better place and the future will hopefully provide that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
