Cuba is set to become the Caribbean island of choice for the discerning, upmarket traveller. Thanks to new twice-weekly direct flights from Gatwick with Virgin Atlantic, starting 4 July 2005, and the opening of Havana's most luxurious hotel, the One&amp;Only Saratoga, also next summer, this bastion of communism is destined to make a splash in the luxury travel market. 'Unlike some of the other Caribbean islands, Cuba has more than just beaches,' said Kuoni's product director, Francis Torrilla. 'It has always been popular for people who want to combine culture with a resort holiday, but until now it hasn't offered the same standards as you'll find in other parts of the Caribbean. This is all changing now.' The new Cuban property has one of the best locations in Havana's old town, opposite the Partagas cigar factory and the Capitolio (Cuba's equivalent of the White House)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
