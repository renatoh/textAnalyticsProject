A statement from the European Ryder Cup board confirms that the 34th edition of the matches, due to be played at the Belfry next week but called off because of the atrocities in the United States, will be played there on September 27-29 next year and the event will continue, as before, in alternate years. Next year's dates are convenient in that the American Express World Golf Championship tournament is played in Ireland, at Mount Juliet, the previous week, so the American team will be in Europe. The cup has been played in odd years since it began in 1927. But Jim Awtrey, chief executive officer of the US PGA, said: \"The rescheduling of the Ryder Cup to even-numbered years and the President's Cup to odd appears to be the most logical solution. A major change like this affects many people and organisations but we are pleased with the support from them all.\" The President's Cup, darling of the US Tour commissioner Tim Finchem, has been protected by the sequence change but the Solheim Cup, once called \"the Ryder Cup with lipstick\", has not. It has been played in even years in part to avoid a clash with the Ryder Cup. As things now stand, it will be played next year at Interlachen, Minnesota, the week before the Ryder Cup and the same week as the American Express event. What is a solution for the men is a problem for the women. Here in Paris it is business not quite as usual. By Tuesday many of the 138 players had gathered for the 32nd playing of the Troph\u00e9e Lancome. So had most of the officials and St Nom-la-Bretche was dressed in tournament order. Then a diktat was issued from Lancome headquarters: the tournament was to be cancelled. An unspecified member of the Lancome board, who had been in America, had concluded that a golf tournament at this time was not appropriate and it would be called off. It was not as simple as that. The event is part-owned by the International Management Group, whose European director Patrick Proisy was insistent that the tournament continue. \"You don't,\" he said, \"cancel tournaments the day before they're due to begin.\" In any case the tournament, as distinct from the title, is, says Proisy, \"the property of IMG\". He went on: \"Lancome are no longer an active sponsor but of the 150 or so secondary sponsors only three have pulled out and of the 22 tents in the tented village only three will be empty.\" Most of the players want nothing more than to get back to their jobs and, having been assured that the \u00a3900,000 prize money is still there, they will do so tomorrow. Lancome will continue to contribute financially but will be doing none of its usual corporate entertaining or promotional programmes. Though Tiger Woods has withdrawn, there is as strong a field as could be wished for, headed by Sergio Garcia, Colin Montgomerie and Retief Goosen, the US Open champion. The Spaniard is ranked seventh in the world, the Scot 11th and the South African 15th. Montgomerie in particular will be keen to have a good week. He has spent 379 weeks in the top 10 of the rankings, the fourth best in their history, behind only Greg Norman (644 weeks), Nick Faldo (470) and Bernhard Langer (405)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
