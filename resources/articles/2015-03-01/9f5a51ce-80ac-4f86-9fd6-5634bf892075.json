Sir Amyas Morse, who leads the National Audit Office, accused ministers of irresponsible decision-making. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do radical surgery it would be nice if you knew where the heart was,\u201d he said in an interview with the Financial Times. \u201cYou\u2019re slightly more likely not to stick a knife in it by mistake.\u201d Morse, who reports directly to parliament rather than to a minister, warned that officials lack the information or overview to judge whether cuts were leading to improvements in efficiency or simply stripping back services. Under David Cameron\u2019s leadership, an \u201coptimism bias\u201d had encouraged ministers to pursue projects in which they deeply believed \u2014 such as the NHS reforms \u2014 without fully debating the potential risks, Morse added. He pointed to local government cuts, which have led to a major reduction in the funding of social care and intensified the pressure on the NHS. \u201cNow if you\u2019re going to go through much deeper, more profound organisational cuts ... you need to understand what you\u2019re doing better than that,\u201d he said. Speaking two days before George Osborne announces his his sixth budget, Morse said ministers were being \u201cmore \u2018executive\u2019 in style\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s wrong, but it\u2019s a feature,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means that as a civil servant, you\u2019re faced with someone who\u2019s saying \u2018this is what I strongly believe we should do here\u2019\u201d. Where there are problems or deficiencies with policies, civil servants had sometimes been reluctant to address them, he added. \u201cWhat I observed is something that I will collectively describe as the feather game. Because if you keep blowing the feather hopefully it will land on someone else,\u201d he said. He added that civil servants should not adopt the attitude that they are not responsible for what happens in local government. While this reluctance by departments to add to their responsibilities was understandable at one level, \u201cyou\u2019d like to feel that they\u2019d be steering towards the sound of gunfire, rather than steering away from it\u201d, he said. Morse said the Treasury had initially been disinclined to scrutinise whether the severance payments offered to departing public sector staff were suitable. \u201cThey were very much not wanting to agree to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd although they have now agreed to do it, they didn\u2019t want to have the responsibility for picking up patterns and being a bit of a detector of things that might be going wrong.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
