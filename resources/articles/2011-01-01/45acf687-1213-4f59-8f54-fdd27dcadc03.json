Midway through Radio 3's 12-day marathon, the station again teamed up with Kings Place, where the year-long Mozart Unwrapped festival is just getting going. And if the live broadcast offered Mozart in your living room, that's not so far from what the live experience was like; a chamber orchestra of modern instruments playing in a hall of such acoustic warmth makes for very up-close, loud listening. Perhaps Colin Davis's veteran hands might have held the Aurora Orchestra back, conjuring quieter pianissimos to set the ebullient fortes in relief; but Davis was ill, and so Nicholas Collon stepped in to conduct the ensemble he founded six years ago. Under Collon, the playing was vividly exuberant, yet still thoughtful and stylish. The average age of the orchestra can't be a day over 30, and the musicians play as if they have something to prove. The opening bars of the overture to La Clemenza di Tito bristled with intent. The Linz Symphony, No 36, opened very differently, with the strings holding back the vibrato and with Collon's fluid beat fostering a sense of mystery; but the finale, thick with horn and trumpet, was jubilant. In between were two arias and a concerto. Fflur Wyn charmed all comers with Nehmt Meinen Dank, but this relatively simple number must have been a breeze after Vorrei Spiegarvi, oh Dio!, which began as a silky duet with Thomas Barber's solo oboe, before turning into a cartwheeling showpiece that took her silvery soprano sky-high. For the Violin Concerto No 5, the soloist was Thomas Gould, the orchestra's leader \u2013 and perhaps he was still in chamber-music mode, for while his first entry was beautifully spacious, as the allegro got going his playing lacked bravura. Gould clearly doesn't want to be a hectoring concerto soloist, but a little more assertiveness would go a long way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
