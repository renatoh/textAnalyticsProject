The increases come just as Americans anxiously ready themselves for an election season climax, in which the incumbent Donald Trump has attacked healthcare providers and adopted Covid-19 misinformation in his final arguments for re-election. Over the weekend Trump hinted he might fire Anthony Fauci, the US\u2019s foremost infectious diseases expert, if re-elected. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody, but let me wait until a little bit after the election. I appreciate the advice. I appreciate it,\u201d said Trump after the Florida crowd chanted: \u201cFire Fauci.\u201d Trump also falsely claimed: \u201cOur doctors get more money if someone dies from Covid. You know that, right?\u201d Dr Jim Souza, chief medical officer for St Luke\u2019s, a hospital system with several locations in Idaho, responded: \u201cIf you\u2019ve never seen a patient intubated on mechanical ventilation, connected to a dialysis machine, in a prone position, sedated and paralyzed \u2013 if you\u2019ve never been part of that care \u2013 it\u2019s heavy physical labor, it\u2019s psychologically heavy work. \u201cIt is just not OK to be calling into question the professional ethics of the very people who are on the frontlines fighting this fire,\u201d said Souza. Idaho has seen a 10% increase in cases in the last week. It is among a handful of the worst-hit states per capita in the nation, including neighboring Montana and Wyoming. North and South Dakota continue to lead the nation in new Covid-19 cases per capita. More than 231,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the US, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. While the outbreak is worse in the west, it is not confined to that region. Infection and hospitalization rates have trended upward across the United States in the last two-week period, according to Covid Exit Strategy. Uncontained spread makes one of the central tenets of lowering transmission \u2013 contact tracing \u2013 extremely difficult to impossible, as evidenced last month when North Dakota told residents to trace and notify their own contacts. But even as an autumn wave swells, Trump has spent the final days of his campaign insisting the US is \u201crounding the corner\u201d on the Covid-19 pandemic; holding in-person rallies which may have spread the disease to as many as 30,000 people by one estimate. Trump\u2019s attacks on his rival, the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, have also been focused on Covid-19, as he told a crowd in North Carolina that Biden would \u201clock down\u201d the nation again and make the country a \u201cprison state\u201d to contain the virus. \u201cMore and more facilities are requesting [personal protective equipment],\u201d said Dr Shikha Gupta, executive director of Get Us PPE, a non-profit which supplies healthcare facilities with PPE, when they cannot find equipment through suppliers. \u201cWe are deeply unprepared for what that\u2019s going to bring as hospitals reach capacity across the US with surging caseloads.\u201d Nursing homes, where less than 1% of Americans live but which account for 41% of Covid-19 deaths, also remain extremely vulnerable to outbreaks. \u201cWe lack personal protective equipment, we lack comprehensive surveillance and testing, and, to be honest, a number of nursing homes still struggle with infection control,\u201d David C Grabowski, a health policy professor at Harvard Medical School, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this play out now twice.\u201d Nancy Roberts, a respiratory therapist at St Luke\u2019s, said she had seen Covid-19-positive patients come in, \u201cand they\u2019re on just a little bit of oxygen, and in 24 hours they could be intubated and on a ventilator, and they\u2019re terrified. \u201cFor somebody to not believe this is happening, it blows my mind. I cannot personally wrap my head around that,\u201d Roberts said. \u2018One death is one too many deaths from this virus.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
