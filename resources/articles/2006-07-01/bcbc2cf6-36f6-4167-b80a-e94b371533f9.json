A cheque for \u00a330m was duly signed and Andriy Shevchenko became a Chelsea player. \"I was very happy with my years at Milan and the team was always in my heart and will always remain in my heart. I love the country, it's very special and the fans treated me very well,\" said Shevchenko in his first interview as a Chelsea player, held in the unusual surrounds of the Beverly Hills Hotel, where the Premiership champions are staying during their eight-day visit to Los Angeles. \"But with respect to the clubs who have been looking to sign me, it's always Chelsea who have been consistent in wanting me for the past three years.\" It was the Milanese tifosi who tied Shevchenko's heartstrings to the San Siro for so long, initially preventing even Abramovich from luring him to London. Yet after Shevchenko's high-water mark of the 2003 European Cup final, Milan's fortunes began to ebb and Abramovich's overtures, articulated in Russian, would eventually pay off. There are those in football who would have construed the wooing to be an illegal approach but even the Milan president Silvio Berlusconi had to accept that his star striker's destiny lay at Stamford Bridge. \"I have a great rapport with Berlusconi and [the vice-president Adriano] Galliani at Milan and you saw the sadness that it brought to them by me leaving but they also understood why I wanted them to let me go and they allowed that to happen,\" said Shevchenko in word-perfect Italian that was translated by an interpreter. \"I've only played for two teams previously, this will be my third. Right now, though, in my head, I hope that this will be where I end my career. That's my hope. I've played for Milan and Dinamo Kiev and I've been happy at both places, so I hope I will be happy here and this will be my last club.\" Though it is clear that Shevchenko's rare talents leave even the most powerful men besotted like the common fan, he insists there is a professional distance between himself and the Chelsea owner, who had little hesitation in equalling the sum that Manchester United paid Leeds for Rio Ferdinand in July 2002. \"My relationship with him is that I knew him previously because he wanted me to come and play for his club,\" said Shevchenko. He insisted that neither he nor his wife has been to dinner with the Abramovichs, though he did concede that there had been much contact between him and the Chelsea owner over the past 36 months. \"He was persistent. When Roman first approached me, I told him I was happy at Milan. \"I had a good career but now I have a child and my wife [the American former model Kristen Pazik] has another child on the way, [the transfer] is family motivated but it had to be the right club. It meant a lot to me that Chelsea have wanted me for the last three years and that is the reason I chose them.\" Part of the reason Shevchenko chose to move to London is that he does not speak fluent English. Either his grasp of the language is not yet strong enough to understand dressing-room banter or his new team-mates are respectfully letting Shevchenko settle before he becomes the target of jokes, because he reports that no one has yet teased him over his bond with Abramovich. \"No one's done anything like that,\" he said, his eyes remaining expressionless. \"I assume, in fact I know, that these are very professional players. I believe that I have done enough in my career as a footballer that people should be able to understand I am here for my footballing abilities and not for any other reason.\" Shevchenko gives the credit for his rapid development to the late Valeriy Lobanovskiy, his former coach at Kiev, at every opportunity. So deep do his affections run for Lobanovskiy that, having won the Champions League 12 months after he passed away, Shevchenko took his winner's medal to Lobanovskiy's grave to \"show\" it to his former mentor. \"He told me that it was very difficult in life to reach a certain level, the maximum, but even more difficult to remain there,\" said Shevchenko. \"I have lived my life, every second, every minute, every day with that philosophy and that is my motivation.\" If Shevchenko can manage to achieve that in each of the four years of his contract, even the \u00a330m Abramovich paid for him might prove to be money well spent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
