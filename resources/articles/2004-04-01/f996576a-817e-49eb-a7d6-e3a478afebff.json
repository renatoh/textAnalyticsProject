'This summer I'm very much looking forward to packing Desuetude, by my wonderful friend Cornelia Unreadable,' they will say, when called by the books desks of our newspapers. 'Enthralling, witty, strangely moving, it is, quite simply, the most vibrant account yet written of the tremendous debt owed by democracy to the history of cardboard packaging.' It's a fat lie, of course: they will be packing a Wilbur Smith called something like Guns, Breasts and Sterotypes About Women and the Filthy Negro, but that's not quite the point: they get their lie in print, and, suddenly, another books list exists. The Summer Reading lists join the Top 100 Books Ever! list and the Waterstone's Recommends list and the WH Smith 'I liked the cover but got scared by all the words and dropped fruit pap down my bib' list, and it's wrong, all wrong. There is only one list which readers - and, just as importantly, authors - ever need: it's a list I'm compiling called Things That Stop You Reading Books, Instantly, and last week I realised, finally, which Thing is the undisputed number one. For a while I was happy reading the book, a grand thriller, written by a friend, infinitely more talented than Cornelia Unreadable ... and then suddenly, on page 20, she did the Thing. It was a meal being described, you see, a fraught meal. Three people: two sisters and a man. They order, at length. Steaks, fish, wine, all described in fine detail. As the waiter leaves, one sister excuses herself to go to the loo: the other pair, who have history, stare at each other awkwardly for 'a second or two'. The girl says one sentence, fairly anodyne. The chap replies, briefly: again, just a sentence. And then, woefully, the author wrote this: Thankfully, just then, the waiter arrived with their food. No, he didn't. That didn't happen. That waiter doesn't exist. That's a lie. The food didn't come in 18 seconds. Even in the very best restaurants - the ones where they don't even cook the steaks, just lop the horns off and walk the beast through a warm room - no food arrives just 18 seconds after you've ordered it. And with that one lazy line, that one non-existent waiter, my nice author had lost me. Lost the bond of trust, my willing suspension of disbelief. No, I said to myself, giving up on her forever with a long sad sigh and turning on the radio: that just didn't happen. You got that wrong, by making it up lazily, and now I don't really believe any of it, and don't want to play along. And then, bizarrely enough, the radio began to play the same game, and I realised, perhaps a little belatedly, that there are made-up waiters everywhere, especially in real life; lazy confections which are there simply, it seems, to insult us. Palestine only has itself to blame. We still have reliable intelligence pointing to WMDs. They finished their coffee in silence and the waiter brought the bill. No it doesn't, no you don't, no he didn't. You just made that up, and badly. Please look out, these odd days, for the phoney waiter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
