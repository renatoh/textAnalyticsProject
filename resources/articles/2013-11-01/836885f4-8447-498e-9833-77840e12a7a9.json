Announcing her appointment, Gordon Brown mispronounced her name. The important thing in the EU's eyes was that she wasn't Tony Blair. The advantage of dispatching a \"nobody\" to head up the EU foreign service might have been that Britain was not that keen on it in the first place. Few, except those who had worked with Lady Ashton, knew of her qualities as a negotiator. On Sunday \"Lady Qui?\" pulled off the biggest diplomatic coup in the history of EU foreign policy. The agreement with Iran may have indeed established the existence of such a policy. It was not solely her doing but the deal was testament to four years of dogged work, much of it conducted away from the camera lights. On Sunday, she was in the unaccustomed position of being showered with praise. She must be smiling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
