There is an elevated walkway that reaches out from the steep incline of a hill and enables the visitor to walk above the treetops. And at each stage it is possible to see the vegetation indigenous to this part of the world, plants like umzimbeet, ironplum and wild strangler figs. The forest is so named because it is on the site of an ancient burial ground of the Sibiya dynasty, and in Zulu \"dlinza\" means sepulchre or grave. But in one of those verbal felicities at which Zulu excels, the verb from which the noun derives means something more complicated. It describes a multi-layered response to death, including acts of remembrance, but also meditation and thought. Walking on Hampstead Heath early yesterday I took note of the inscriptions on the benches, which people have dedicated to the memory of people who have died. I'm told that there are some 700 such benches on the Heath, of which there are two that appeal to me particularly. These are the two that, in contravention of the form, had been dedicated prior to the death of the person concerned. \"Albert Thomas Green,\" read one inscription, \"still alive and kicking.\" \"Gentle neighbour sigh not yet,\" said the other, inscribed only to \"Ben W 1912 -\", \"I've only gone to Somerset.\" I sat on Ben's bench to tackle what remained of Araucaria's Wednesday puzzle, at the heart of which was one of those extended anagrams that crop up from time to time. Except it was more than that. \"4 - hot gelignite and hot TNT go unstable leading to double 13\" (2, 3, 2, 6, 4, 4, 4, 5)* where 4 was STAY PUT and 13 was RAGE. Pre-dedicating your bench struck me as one way to rage against the dying of the light, even though in Albert Green's case someone had added the inevitable ending: \"But now sadly missed (14.10.96).\" *Answer: DO NOT GO GENTLE INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT \u00b7 Sandy Balfour is the author of Pretty Girl in Crimson Rose (8), out now in paperback. info@sandybalfour.com \ufffd Sandy Balfour 2004."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
