Villa's latest home defeat, to Manchester City on Sunday, leaves them in 15th position. Their record of six wins in 25 league games has resulted in intense pressure on the manager, Alex McLeish. \"No, we're staying positive,\" said Albrighton when asked if Villa are fighting for survival. \"We have two games now against Blackburn and Wigan where we know we are good enough to beat those teams. So we're aiming for six points now, nothing less, that will lift us back up the table. We've just got to stick together, everybody at the club has to unite and hopefully we can get out of this slump and start winning football matches.\" Villa's troubles on their own ground have been key to their poor run. McLeish's side have not won at home since 5 November. \"We definitely need to get out of this slump because it's not a good thing to have against you that you've not won in so many games at home,\" Albrighton admitted. \"Villa Park should be a fortress, but it's not been good lately, and the fans will be the first to tell you that.\" Albrighton expressed his support for McLeish. The Scot was an unpopular choice to succeed G\u00e9rard Houllier last summer, on account of his spell in charge of rivals Birmingham City. During the intervening months, an element of the Villa support has continued to voice their disquiet towards McLeish. \"I'm in favour of the gaffer,\" Albrighton added. \"He's been doing well in training for us, he helps us out and he speaks to us, which is what you want from a manager. I thought the fans were terrific inside the ground on Sunday, they were brilliant. They got behind us from the first minute, and that's what we need going through this bad time. Hopefully we can repay them over the next couple of games.\" McLeish's cause has not been helped by confirmation that his influential centre-half, Richard Dunne, will be out of action for up to eight weeks. Dunne underwent surgery on a fractured shoulder in Birmingham on Monday; the Irishman incurred the injury when landing awkwardly after challenging City's goalkeeper Joe Hart for a cross ball. \"We've players who can step into his boots and hopefully they can do a job,\" said Albrighton. \"Dunney is the kind of guy who will chuck his body on the line, chuck his head anywhere. On this occasion he's landed funny, had a bit of an impact and he is not looking good, but he'll bounce back.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
