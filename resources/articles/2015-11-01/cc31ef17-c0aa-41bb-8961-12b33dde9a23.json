The Metropolitan police said three officers were taken to hospital after being injured, while some protesters were treated for bloody injuries and given first aid at the scene. What started off as a peaceful protest descended into violence when activists clashed with officers. A police car was set alight and its windscreen smashed near Green Park as thousands of anti-capitalist campaigners flowed past the capital\u2019s landmarks wearing the trademark Guido masks of the Anonymous hacking group. Three men were arrested before the march began after a police search turned up knives, smoke and paint grenades, gas canisters and lock picks. The three men, aged 38, 55 and 50, were held at a central London police station on suspicion of being in possession of offensive weapons. There was a sudden surge of activity about half an hour into the event, as several people at the front broke off and ran towards the Churchill War Rooms. More crowds gathered outside Buckingham Palace, a long way from the agreed route. Some tried to enter Great George Street, a short distance from Conservative party headquarters, which was closed off. A line of police and mounted officers formed a barrier against the densely packed protesters, some of whom were screaming about inequality. Stray bottles were thrust over the barriers towards officers to cheers and chants of \u201cShame on you, we\u2019re human too\u201d. The Metropolitan police deployed what they described as a \u201csignificant policing operation\u201d, including thousands of extra officers drafted in to tackle expected unrest, after previous events ended in arrests and clashes with police across the city centre. In Trafalgar Square at 6.40pm, sirens could be heard from almost all directions. The area was ringed by dozens of police in riot vans, their visored helmets strapped to their overalls. On the wall of the National Gallery was a message telling people that they might be asked to remove their face coverings. The march usually sees demonstrators march wearing Guy Fawkes masks. \u201cFailure to comply is an offence,\u201d it said ominously. One protester, a musician who gave her name as Lola, said she had travelled from Hull to the capital to speak up for others. She said: \u201cThere are people who aren\u2019t represented, they should be here. I am the people. We are peaceful, we are doing this in a peaceful manner, but the media focus on the 1% who cause trouble.\u201d Another self-proclaimed anarchist, Aztecarna Peatonito from Mexico, said he wanted a peaceful way of spreading a message against inequality: \u201cWe tried for six years to get the press to take us seriously. It is only when we wore the masks that we started getting attention. Anyone who is violent is not with us.\u201d As protesters returned to Trafalgar Square after some went to Parliament Square and Buckingham Palace, police used a kettle operation to contain them. The Met said late on Thursday night: \u201cTo prevent further crime and disorder, two containments are in place in the vicinity of St Martin\u2019s Place, Trafalgar Square and Parliament Street, Whitehall.\u201d Jono, 24, from London, said: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve noticed since we\u2019ve got into Trafalgar Square is police trying to contain large numbers of people who just wanted to stand in the square and allow their voice to be heard. It\u2019s not really a free country if you can\u2019t just stand in the streets and let your voice be heard. But I\u2019ve not seen any aggression.\u201d Not everyone was impressed, however. Tourist Sarah Slone, 19, from Utah, said the protest was \u201ca bit like anarchy, really \u2013 they don\u2019t seem organised in their thoughts or actions\u201d. Ch Supt Pippa Mills earlier explained why the Met had imposed such stringent conditions on the demonstration. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely essential that the police are able to balance the needs of those who want to protest peacefully with those who live, work and visit London,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the last three years, we\u2019ve seen people going about their daily business seriously intimidated and disrupted by these protesters at this event.\u201d The protest severely disrupted traffic in Westminster and central London because of the number of road closures."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
