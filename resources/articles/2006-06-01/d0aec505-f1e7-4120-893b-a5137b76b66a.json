The chancellor has travelled abroad many times before, of course, but his frequent trips to Washington and Africa, trade missions to China and occasional, reluctant expeditions on the Eurostar to Brussels are not the equal of today's formal discussions with the German chancellor Angela Merkel. Now Europe's most powerful political leader, after winning last year's close German election, she is meeting Mr Brown in the expectation that he is the man she will have to do business with when Tony Blair stands down. Getting this relationship right will be one of the big challenges for a Brown government: if Britain can work with Germany, on trade, the environment, global poverty and European reform, the chancellor will be able to make progress on some of the issues he cares most about. Until now, Mr Brown's dealings with Europe have had all the grace of a man leaving the rubbish out by the back door. He has never looked enthusiastic or even particularly interested, and that has come across in his speeches, which have tended to assert British superiority, sometimes (as in exports and productivity) in the face of the evidence. Fairly or not, he has been seen as a restraining hand on Mr Blair's Euro-enthusiastic shoulders. There are good grounds for hoping that the relationship with Ms Merkel might be different. For a start, she has been preaching a message of reform, both inside Germany and to the rest of Europe, and she has rebuilt her country's relationship with the United States, which was left in tatters by her predecessor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. These are all pluses in Mr Brown's book. As an east German, she seems prepared to look beyond the Franco-German axis which has dominated European affairs for so long. And like Mr Brown, she can expect to be in office until the end of the decade, making a long-term relationship possible. Meanwhile France's political future is unclear. An exploratory Brown visit to Paris looks some way off. For the chancellor, it is a chance to play himself into office, real progress towards the stable and orderly transition he says he wants. As such, it is exactly the sort of thing he should be doing. It is not quite on the level of a formal reception by President Bush in Washington - a treat still reserved for Mr Blair - but today's visit is certainly a step along Downing Street from the door of No 11 towards No 10."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
