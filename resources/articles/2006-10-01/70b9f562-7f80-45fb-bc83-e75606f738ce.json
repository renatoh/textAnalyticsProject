Mikel Jon Obi is available after suspension and Hilario is expected to continue in goal. Carlo Cudicini has stepped up his training after recovering from concussion but he is unlikely to be risked. Rovers' Robbie Savage looks certain to miss out with a knee problem and David Bentley (hamstring) and Andre Ooijer (ribs) are doubtful. Charlton Athletic v Bolton Wanderers Charlton, with two wins from 10 games, may be without Darren Bent and Andy Reid because of tight hamstrings. Amdy Faye, Souleymane Diawara and Dennis Rommedahl are also doubts and all five players will be given fitness tests today with Dowie revealing he will field his strongest team. Bolton are without Abdoulaye Faye and Kevin Nolan. Crewe Alexandra v Manchester United Alan Smith will start his first game for United since dislocating his ankle and breaking his leg in February and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Kieran Richardson and fit-again Gabriel Heinze and Mika\u00ebl Silvestre could all feature. Crewe will be without eight players because of illness and suspension but the assistant manager, Neil Baker, said: \"We've tried to give them the best possible chance of an upset. We'll be organised and hopefully we can do well.\" Liverpool v Reading Rafael Ben\u00edtez will be without Craig Bellamy (ankle), Fabio Aurelio (groin) and Mark Gonz\u00e1lez (ankle) and is likely to rest Steven Gerrard, Sami Hyypia, Xabi Alonso and Steve Finnan. The England Under-19 goalkeeper David Martin, the son of the former West Ham defender Alvin, will be on the bench as Jerzy Dudek is suspended. Reading welcome back the defender Sam Sodje after knee surgery. MK Dons v Tottenham Spurs are likely to recall the striker Dimitar Berbatov but are without Teemu Tainio (hernia) and Steed Malbranque (groin) and Didier Zokora is a doubt. The Dons' manager, Martin Allen, may leave out Adolfo Baines, Ben Chorley, Nicky Rizzo, Joe Tillen, Joe Howe and Rob Webb, who are all on the transfer list. Newcastle v Portsmouth Glenn Roeder will hand a first start to his on-loan striker Giuseppe Rossi. Celestine Babayaro is also in the starting line-up after his ban but Emre Belozoglu and Antoine Sibierski are injured. Pompey are without the captain, Dejan Stefanovic, (knee) and a thigh injury may sideline Glen Johnson. Lomana LuaLua has recovered from a virus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
