It was tempting to suggest that Bowie was no more likely to turn up at the Brits than he was to turn up at Victoria station and start flogging mocha frappe lattes on the Caffe Nero stand by Platform 18, but there was always the chance he'd been persuaded to draw a line under a decade of zealously guarded privacy not merely by the prospect of snatching the best British male prize from under the noses of Jake Bugg and Tom Odell, but the enticing opportunity to sit in the O2 Arena and watch Bastille and James Corden. But even the wild suggestion that the reclusive chameleon of rock might show up was drowned out by the din caused when an angry broadsheet journalist went public with the list of demands made upon attending members of the press by sponsors MasterCard's PR agency, in which regularly and enthusiastically mentioning the credit card and its slogan Priceless Moments on Twitter figured heavily. By mid-morning, the slogan had been hijacked: the social media site was indeed awash with the #PricelessSurprises hashtag, alas attached to tweets suggesting surprises including \"being told you've got chlamydia\". The Brit organisers might reasonably have surmised that things could only get better once the ceremony was under way, which they duly did. Despite triumphing in his category, Bowie was a no show \u2013 perhaps he was busy knocking up a chai latte by platform 18 in Victoria station - which meant he missed not merely Corden making jokes about cocaine and daringly marking the passing of the watershed by saying \"shit\", but the Brits going about their usual thing of presenting awards to exactly the artists you'd expect, the Brits being in the business of rewarding success. It would have been nice had John Grant unexpectedly walked off with the best international male, but it was never going to happen in a category that also featured Bruno Mars; whatever the qualities of their fellow nominees, Bastille were always going to win best newcomer, because they'd sold more albums. In fairness, they told you what you already knew with a greater degree of panache than last year, when the Brit Awards' deathless quest for what their chairman describes as \"gravitas\" led them to put together an awards ceremony that had all the gravitas and indeed all the entertainment value of a meeting of the environment food and rural affairs committee. They pulled off a number of coups, a lot of which involved the curious business of, as Corden put it, \"celebrating a year in which British acts have taken the world by storm\" by getting acts who weren't British to turn up . Prince was inveigled into presenting an award, there were performances from Pharrell Williams, Lorde and Beyonc\u00e9, the latter clearly the star of the show, particularly given that Lorde's much-vaunted collaboration with Disclosure didn't really spark in the way you might have hoped. But not all: they got the Arctic Monkeys to open the show, which was certainly an advance on previous years, when they'd either declined to turn up or turned up and been so rude about the performing arts school funded by the Brits that their acceptance speech was cut off. Indeed, given that Noel Gallagher \u2013 who some years ago enlivened proceedings with the intriguing suggestion that \"there's only five people in this room who really know what's going on in this country and that's me, our kid, Bonehead, Alan Mcgee and Tony Blair\" \u2013 appeared onstage without incident, you could say that the 2014 ceremony was marked by formerly errant attendees being brought to heel. There was a hint of the chaotic spirit of Brits past when model Rosie Huntingdon-Whitely left a dramatic pause before announcing One Direction as winners of a category in which they'd already been announced as winners by means of a lengthy video, but that's about as dangerous as it got, unless you count David Bowie's acceptance speech \u2013 read by Kate Moss \u2013 in which he appeared to throw his weigh against Scottish independence. Still, given that last year the main danger at the Brits was one or more of the viewers expiring from boredom, then that might be considered an advance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
