Obama then made a monumental gaffe when he said: \"It's like the Special Olympics or something.\" At least one Special Olympian could show the president a thing or two about bowling. Kolan McConiughey of Michigan has bowled three perfect 300 games and averages 266. He has won six Special Olympics bowling medals. McConiughey has a message for Obama: \"I challenge him. I'll show him how to do it. Bring it on, Obama!\" Should the president take up the challenge? Share your thoughts by sending us a response on our GuardianUS Twitter page.
