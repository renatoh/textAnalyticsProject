The full judgment of the ICC tribunal outlines text messages and phone calls between Butt and his agent, Mazhar Majeed, during the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean last year that made the Pakistan captain a central figure in the ICC's anti-corruption investigations. Discussions between Butt and Majeed during the World Twenty20 did not form part of the evidence that resulted in an ICC tribunal banning Butt for 10 years, five of them suspended, and meting out a seven-year ban on Mohammad Asif, two of them suspended, and a five-year ban on his fast-bowling partner Mohammad Amir. However, the BBC has reported that the ICC tribunal's judgment discloses further texts and phone calls between Majeed and Butt that had already alerted ICC anti\u2011corruption investigators. Investigators were examining communications surrounding the World Twenty20 match between Pakistan and South Africa on 10 May when Pakistan won the group match by 11 runs. Suspicion in this tournament has also been directed towards Pakistan's semi-final defeat when Australia pulled off a dramatic recovery. According to the BBC, the tribunal, chaired by Michael Beloff QC, refers in its report to \"suspicious\" calls from Majeed, and says: \"On their face the messages appear to reflect a pre-existing discussion about spot-fixing.\" It adds: \"The episode in spring in St Lucia appears to have been the overture to the main performance in England in the summer.\" What is not stated is whether the ICC's suspicions were in any way a prelude to the News of the World's sting operation. There has never been evidence of collusion. It was because the newspaper expos\u00e9 was a trial run, and did not actually involve placing bets with bookmakers, that the tribunal felt unable to ban Butt, described in the report as \"the ringmaster\", or the two fast bowlers for life. The judgment says: \"Fortunately for them an [un]promising career in spot-fixing was nipped in the bud by the News of the World investigation ... it was a trial run. The purpose was not to influence any outcome or to serve as the basis for betting.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
