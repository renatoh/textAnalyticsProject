Mill Reef won this in 1970 before going on to prove himself one of the outstanding racehorses of the modern era. The recent tendency towards the best two-year-olds not emerging until later in the year means star quality has been lacking of late. Nevertheless, Rock of Gibraltar, the subsequent multiple Group One winner, should have prevailed in 2001 when he finished an unlucky sixth. Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien still managed to win the race, with the 20-1 shot Landseer. He followed up with Statue Of Liberty last year to claim his fourth victory in all since 1997. Newton , O'Brien's selected from four entries, put down his marker when beating six subsequent winners at the Curragh last month. That was on softish ground, but his trainer believes he will be even better on a fast surface. 3.05 King's Stand Stakes (5f) This has been a weak race by Group Two standards since outstanding sprinters such as Dayjur, Sheikh Albadou and Lochsong won in the early 1990s. But the presence of challengers from Australia (Choisir) and Hong Kong (Firebolt) spices up proceedings. The older sprinters are a mixed bag and there must be the chance that one of the three-year-olds can stamp their authority. Elusive City is certainly of interest on his return to sprinting. A speedy two-year-old, he has failed to last home when tried over 7f and a mile this season. This race should allow him to use his natural speed to maximum effect. 3.45 St James's Palace Stakes (1m) The race which will establish the leading miler of the Classic generation. The winner's status will then be measured against the best of the older milers in contests such as the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes back at Ascot in September. There is also the lure of the Breeders' Cup, and this is one of 10 races at Ascot where the winner will be awarded the Ambassador's Cup if also successful at Santa Anita in October. Aidan O'Brien has sent out the last three winners of this Group One and went agonisingly close to following up in America with two of them, Rock Of Gibraltar and Giant's Causeway. But his three runners today may be found wanting. Today's winner will be a worthy challenger for top honours, though, with the winners of the French (Clodovil), Irish (Indian Haven) and German (Martillo) 2,000 Guineas in opposition, as well as the Aga Khan's exciting prospect, Kalaman. This is usually won by a colt with Group One experience, which Kalaman lacks, but the form of his Kempton win puts him close to the Guineas horses here, with the promise of more to come. 4.20 Queen Anne Stakes (1m) When the Pattern race system was established in 1971, this was awarded Group 3 status before becoming Group 2 in 1984. With a fine sense of timing, given the presence of Hawk Wing, it is now Group One. Hawk Wing's performance at Newbury was extraordinary, but things will be tougher here. This time he faces runners trained by Sir Michael Stoute and Saeed bin Suroor, who between them have won this race for the past seven years. Godolphin have nursed Dubai Destination back to form and Approach is a bit of a dark horse from the Stoute stable, whose recent winners here include the subsequent Breeders' Cup scorer, Kalanisi. Recalling how easily Dubai Destination beat Rock of Gibraltar in the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster in 2001, he looks the value against hot favourite Hawk Wing. 4.55 Duke Of Edinburgh Handicap (1m4f) Sir Michael Stoute won this in 1998-99 with the highly-weighted four-year-olds. In Hazim and Researched he has a strong hand again, with Kieren Fallon's mount given narrow preference. Gelded since last season, Researched showed a good attitude to win over 10 furlongs at York. 5.30 Balmoral Handicap (5f) A low draw can be an advantage in big fields up the straight course here. Unbeaten in two races since fitted with a tongue strap to aid his breathing, Baltic King gets the vote from Rectangle and Not So Dusty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
