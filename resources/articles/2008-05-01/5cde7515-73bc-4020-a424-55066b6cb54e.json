This viewpoint is, of course, absolutely groundless. And just to prove it, the Department for Communities and Local Government has been publicising new building regulations that came into force yesterday. They will at last compel private developers to get their homes rated for environmental sustainability, testing the eco standards of properties against nine strict criteria, with an overall rating of between one and six stars. The only problem is that housebuilders can opt for an automatic \"nil rating\", which means that they can go on building homes that produce just as much carbon as ever. The National Housing Federation estimates that up to 98% of private developers will take this route rather than build homes that are genuinely green. Even so that would still mean 2% compliance. Better than 1%. \u00b7 For sure they get some nasty types at HMP Hollesley Bay. Not the very worst you understand. It is only category D. But unpleasant nonetheless; well in need of guidance and rehabilitation. Lord Archer did some of his time there, you know. He spent the last nine months of his two years in jail acting as the prison's librarian, and now, almost five years after his release, they still remember him, as a group of visiting magistrates discovered the other day. \"The governor who debriefed us told us that he had been responsible for Jeffrey Archer while he was at the Bay,\" says Bystander, the London JP and author of the acclaimed Magistrate's Blog. \"Quite the most obnoxious prisoner I have ever dealt with,\" he said. \"Kept trying to tell me how to do my job.\" Hasn't improved since. \u00b7 It was the big event, the Time magazine 100, listing the people who shape our world, so we put our best people on it. They found Tony Blair fairly quickly, in the section called Heroes and Pioneers, alongside the singer and activist Peter Gabriel. Kevin Rudd, the new Aussie prime minister, was there with Clinton and Bush and Obama and Putin, all set down as revolutionaries. But try as they might, they couldn't find Gordon. We'll keep looking, through the classifieds, the small print, through everything. \u00b7 There are now Polish workers in every local authority area of Britain, according to a new study. They live and work and then many of them head home. What impressions of us do they take with them? According to Krakow in Your Pocket, a guide for visitors: \"There are times when Krakow feels as British as being buggered at boarding school.\" We're obsessed with education - they soon learn that. \u00b7 No doubt they also learn something of our obsession with sex, but for all that some of us have always led sheltered lives. In The Bachelor Boy, Steve Turner's biography of Cliff Richard, he recounts the singer's reaction in the 70s to seeing a fellow musician's guitar fuzz box emblazoned with a shadowy face and the trade name Big Muff. \"Big Muff. What a great name for my next album. Instead of that shadowy face, I'll have my face. Big Muff. What a great idea.\" A backing singer, also a Christian, placed his arm around Cliff's shoulder and explained why an alternative concept might be preferable. \"Oh drat! You can't say anything these days,\" moaned Cliff. Snoop Dogg says the same. \u00b7 Which is why ministers are so keen to keep Snoop out of the country. Among his many faults does seem to be a penchant for drugs. And the Met is doing its bit, warning residents in north London that the smell of weed and people carrying black plastic bags may betray the presence of cannabis factories. Or elevenses at Pete Doherty's. \u00b7 Finally we must report that the Diary as you know it is off for a month's sabbatical. In the interim there will be trivia and mendacity from the world's major cities, starting with Paris. Within this announcement, there is both good and bad news. We leave you to say which is which. diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
