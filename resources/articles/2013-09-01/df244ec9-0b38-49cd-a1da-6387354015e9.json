The Hendrix estate was not consulted, so his songs remain locked in the vault. In their place are montage and feedback, cross-dialogue, distortion and the odd cover version (Muddy Waters, Dylan, the Beatles). The result is an unpredictable film, a difficult approximation of a biopic. But it delivers a Jimi Hendrix experience somehow the richer for sidelining the man and subverting his music. Hendrix (an impeccable impression by Outkast's Andr\u00e9 Benjamin) is pursued by two women who \u2013 through a mixture of love, persistence and straight-up bullying \u2013 helped Jimi break the UK. Linda Keith (Imogen Poots) was a sometime model who tired of being just Keith Richards' girlfriend. She would spot Hendrix playing in New York's Cheetah bar, introduce him to acid, and eventually hook him up with Chas Chandler (Andrew Buckley) \u2013 the former Animals bassist who would become the Experience's manager. Hayley Atwell plays Kathy Etchingham, the long-term girlfriend whose part in their tempestuous relationship provided inspiration for several Hendrix classics. Both actors are outstanding, but Poots's performance is her best to date. She plays Keith knowing and tired, beaten by the fatigue of loving someone but never understanding him. Ridley, who also wrote the screenplay for Steve McQueen's Toronto hit 12 Years a Slave, takes pleasure in amplifying this idea of Hendrix as enigma. Jimi is full of loose talk on psychic adventure. He starts in on universal love. Then the conversation cuts and is replaced mid-epiphany with footage from Coronation Street, shots of crowds protesting against the murder of Kelso Cochrane, a Sally army band, a photo of Jimi's dad, a shot of the moon. It has Hendrix as a man of the times, who was sometimes oblivious to them too. The film bows to accessibility only when bringing in other giants of the scene. Contemporaries such as Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton and Andrew Loog Oldham are flagged up via freeze-frame and captions, a distracting device that cuts the film's flow dead. It's a nod to convention that sits awkwardly in a film otherwise intent on skirting tradition. All Is By My Side is long and unwieldy. It refuses to deliver the hits, and will test even fans with its contrariness. It's perverse in the service of defining a man of great perversity. But you leave it thinking that the essence of the man \u2013 exposed through the people around him \u2013 has been brought to the fore. Hendrix was never easy to pigeonhole. All Is By My Side has him, if not in sound, then in spirit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
