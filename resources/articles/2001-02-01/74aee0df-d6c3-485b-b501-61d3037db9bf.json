Good on you! As a fifty year old mother of three working in education (chalk-face) I empathise with many of your thoughts. As we didn't have gap years in our day, I'm damn well going to have one when I retire! In the meantime, going to have to stick with gap weekends and half terms... but my eldest lad's now working in Tokyo, so that's my target for next year. That's it - no advice whatsoever... off to Liverpool for a mini-break at the Adelphi tomorrow, soaking up some Scouse culture. Have a wonderful time in Bali. One of my best friends lived there for a year and my husband's son, Niall is arriving there shortly with his Irish girlfriend, Roisin. Cheers!
