O'Neill said that he intends to speak to the England manager, whom he believes took an unnecessary risk by selecting a player who was not fully fit for a friendly match. Heskey was withdrawn during Villa's 2\u20130 win at Blackburn last Saturday after he complained that he was struggling with his achilles, but he was compelled to report for England duty to be assessed by the medical staff. O'Neill had expected Heskey to return along with Luke Young, who pulled out of the squad with a toe problem but, much to the Villa manager's \"surprise\", he played until half-time, when he was replaced by Peter Crouch. O'Neill reported that the 31-year-old was unable to train because his achilles is \"particularly sore\" and suggested it was highly unlikely he would feature at Goodison Park, although he acknowledged that Heskey may have contributed to the problem through his desire to \"play in a bit of discomfort\". \"It's a friendly game at the end of it all,\" said the Villa manager, who had considered contacting Capello to urge him to rest several of Villa's players. \"Qualifying games are important to the wellbeing of the country. But it was a friendly game and you can lose. There's always a possibility of players getting injured, but if someone has got injured beforehand, I'm not sure [playing them] is a risk worth taking.\" O'Neill is expected to start John Carew alongside Gabriel Agbonlahor because of Heskey's injury. \"He didn't come off because he was tired. He actually had a problem, but England deemed him fit to play in the game. I have spoken to the England doctor and obviously voiced some concerns there. I will speak to the management team.\" Heskey's setback could hardly have come at a worse time for O'Neill, with Villa facing three games in the next seven days that could define their season. Following the Everton fixture, Villa host CSKA Moscow in the Uefa Cup knock-out stages on Wednesday before the pivotal meeting with Chelsea in the Premier League a week on Saturday. It is a punishing schedule and one that may prompt O'Neill to prioritise the Chelsea fixture by resting players in the lead-up. \"Here we are in mid-February involved in three competitions,\" said O'Neill, who added that he was surprised by Chelsea's decision to sack Luiz Felipe Scolari and claimed that the Brazilian was not given enough time. \"This time in a fortnight, we might be in one. That's something I've been used to as a player in the past and I think that it can happen. But I'm not sure [the next week] will shape our season. The momentum in the Premier League is very important.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
