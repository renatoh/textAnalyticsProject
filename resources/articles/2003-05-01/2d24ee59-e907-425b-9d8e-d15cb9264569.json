Wetherby magistrates heard that the 25-year-old was arrested outside his home in Leeds last January by police checking to see whether his BMW car had been stolen. Bakke was found guilty by a district judge who criticised him for trying to delay a breath test procedure at a police station by telling officers he had a poor command of English. The court heard that Bakke was taken to Chapeltown police station in Leeds where he gave a breath test reading of 85 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath - more than twice the legal limit of 35. His solicitor, Nick Freeman, argued that the footballer's legal rights had been breached by officers who failed to deal adequately with his poor English. But district judge Roy Anderson said: \"The principal issue is Mr Bakke's alleged difficulties in comprehending precisely what was going on. \"It is alleged that he was disadvantaged by having only moderate use of spoken English and a complete lack of written English. \"But there is persuasive evidence that his apparent difficulties were, in reality, a ruse to delay and obstruct the proceedings which he eventually acknowledged and which ruse he eventually abandoned.\" The judge added: \"I conclude that his actions from his time of arriving at the police station until his admission to Sergeant Kaur (the custody suite sergeant) about his level of English were intended to delay the intoximiser procedure which he knew was required of him.\" The judge was told by Mr Freeman that Bakke had admitted the drink driving but had pleaded not guilty on a technicality. Mr Freeman told the court: \"He's extremely embarrassed for the trouble that he's caused not only to himself but to his family, Leeds United Football Club and to the supporters.\" The solicitor explained that it was particularly embarrassing for a Norwegian national as the drink drive penalties in that country are much more severe than in the UK. Mr Freeman continued: \"It's something he deeply regrets.\" He said to the judge: \"I invite you to treat this as an aberration with no chance of being repeated.\" Bakke was told his ban would be reduced by six months if he agreed to go on a drink drivers' rehabilitation scheme. Bakke declined to comment as he left court. Also in court today, in spirit at least, was Liverpool's El Hadji Diouf, who faces a charge of assaulting a fan he allegedly spat on during the Uefa Cup game against Celtic in March. The Senegal international was excused from the hearing as his case was opened today at Glasgow Sheriff Court. No plea or declaration was entered on his behalf and the case was continued until May 30. Diouf is alleged to have spat at a fan after falling into the crowd during a 1-1 draw at Celtic Park, Glasgow, on March 13. He has since apologised for the incident and invited the fan - Celtic season ticket holder Dominic Schiavone - to be his VIP guest for the return fixture. The Glasgow club was later fined \u00a32,300 by European football's governing body UEFA in connection with the incident."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
