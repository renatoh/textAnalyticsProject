She stations herself at the raw and unpretty end of the already guttural world of throat singing, voicing an array of constipated growls, lupine snuffles and girlish yelps \u2013 to some listeners it will sound merely silly, and almost everyone will be turned off by the baggy hip-hop track Centre, a reminder that you don\u2019t go to environmental rallies for the music. But elsewhere Tagaq is riveting, especially when multitracked and given eight or so minutes to range jazzily around art-metal backdrops. Summoning conjures unease with a far-off cello and builds to cult-like chanting, while Cold rides a gnarly groove into a vision of eternal meltwater. Anyone who loves Jenny Hval\u2019s blood-soaked ruminations or Maja Ratkje\u2019s explosive tics will be transfixed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
