A fascinating article has emerged from a disgruntled partner of an EA employee talking about their partner's ridiculously long working hours. The point here isn't that it is EA - they are one of the most professional - but working conditions at game devs generally. Yes, things can get manic when final deadlines approach, but are all developers like this? If so, what does that say about the quality of management? With the likes of Halo 2 and GTA selling millions, isn't it time the guys and gals who actually make these games get a fair deal?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
