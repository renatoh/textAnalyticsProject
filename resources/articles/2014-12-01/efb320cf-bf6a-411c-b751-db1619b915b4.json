In a stream of comments on his English-language Twitter feed, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday returned to a theme he has repeatedly struck since Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson in Missouri on 9 August. In his latest outpouring, Khamenei seeks to highlight what he sees as the hypocrisy of the US at Christmas by suggesting a link between Jesus suffering for the oppressed, and official oppression of protesters in Ferguson. \u201c#Jesus endured sufferings to oppose tyrants who had put humans in hell in this world&amp; the hereafter while he backed the oppressed. #Ferguson\u201d he tweeted. In another post, on Christmas Eve, the Ayatollah wrote: \u201cIf #Jesus were among us today he wouldn\u2019t spare a second to fight the arrogants&amp;support the oppressed.#Ferguson #Gaza\u201d When it comes to domestic US affairs, Khamenei is quite the regular commentator. In 2011, when Occupy protests were erupting across America, he predicted the movement would bring down the entire capitalist system. After protests exploded in Ferguson after Brown\u2019s death, he seized on the events to criticise race relations generally in the US. He wrote: \u201cToday like previous years, African-Americans are still under pressure, oppressed and subjected to discrimination. #Ferguson\u201d When a grand jury decision sparing Wilson of any charges in Brown\u2019s shooting was announced on 24 November, sparking disorder in Ferguson and further protests across the US, Khamenei returned to the theme. He accused the US government of being dishonest with its citizens, tweeting: \u201cAt events in #Ferguson US is fighting w its ppl. #BlackLivesMatter\u201d Khamenei\u2019s English-language Twitter feed is unverified by the social media company. It is widely understood that the account is managed by the supreme leader\u2019s personal office, though they too will neither confirm or deny it. Its existence casts a sliver of light into the thinking of the man who has wielded ultimate power in Iran for the past 25 years, a time of ongoing tension with the US over the country\u2019s nuclear programme. The Twitter feed also acts as a megaphone for official Iranian policy, with regular denunciations of the Israeli government and Zionism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
