Ferozur Rahman, 83, was found unconscious with head injuries on Friday and died in hospital on Saturday night. Mr Rahman, a father of seven, had lived on the Toynbee estate in Bethnal Green for 20 years and knew the disgraced cabinet minister John Profumo, who worked on the estate after he quit his job in 1963. Detectives visited local businesses yesterday to check for CCTV footage and appealed for witnesses. His attackers may have been trying to burgle his ground-floor flat but police said it was unclear whether anything had been stolen. Residents say they have campaigned for better security measures. Dennis Delderfield, who chairs the residents' association, said: \"Flats are constantly burgled and a blind woman was attacked here two years ago. It's a very scary place to live and we always get abuse shouted at us and spat on.\" Arthur Rumble, 79, said: \"Normally there are six or seven of the gang members hanging around here. They cause havoc. They drink, shout abuse and do drugs. I have been here for five years and the first night I came here I was mugged, and I haven't been out after 3pm since.\" Mr Rahman's son-in-law Abjal Hussain, 43, said he was not aware of any recent problems with antisocial behaviour. \"This happened a long time ago, as far as I can remember, but not recently. There was a problem in the area but not with him particularly. Apart from that, I don't know.\" Describing Mr Rahman, he said: \"He was a good man who was likely to help everyone. He was like a community worker ... When I think about what happened I am very shocked. We are not really taking it in.\" Despite being invited to move in with relatives, Mr Rahman had preferred to live on his own after the death of his wife, Mr Hussain said. Detective Inspector Larry Smith, heading the murder investigation, said: \"Mr Rahman was a frail, elderly man. He was last seen alive at 9.30pm on Thursday and unfortunately he was found by his 17-year-old grandson on Friday at 2pm. \"There had been a forced entry into the flat and he had suffered a head injury.\" A postmortem is to take place today. Mr Smith said: \"Someone must have seen something. There would have been a lot of noise and someone must have put their head out the window and seen someone running off. We are still in the early stages of the investigation and can't say if anything was taken from the flat or what the motive may have been. \"This was a ghastly crime. Why would you assault an 83-year-old when you could just run away?\" The Toynbee Hall complex, which runs social projects, is best-known as the place where Mr Profumo worked after he resigned from the Macmillan government over his affair with Christine Keeler.
