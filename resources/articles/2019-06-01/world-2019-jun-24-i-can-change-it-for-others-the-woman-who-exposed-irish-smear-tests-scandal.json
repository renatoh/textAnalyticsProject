Emerging from the doctor\u2019s office she avoided the gazes of her daughter and mother waiting outside and sought refuge in a bathroom. \u201cI was in there for about 20 minutes. I bawled my eyes out.\u201d She composed herself, and then came the anger \u2013 not just for the prognosis of terminal cervical cancer but for the medical blunders that preceded it. \u201cI\u2019ve always been bullheaded and stubborn,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought: I\u2019m not taking this. I\u2019ve got two small kids. You can\u2019t honestly tell me to go home and die. I was so fucking angry.\u201d Eighteen months later, Phelan, 44, is very much alive and has been celebrated in Ireland for not taking this \u2013 not the grim prognosis nor the catalogue of grievous mistakes by medical authorities. A formidable researcher and campaigner, she successfully fought for access to pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy drug, which has shrunk the tumour and extended her life. The Irish state now offers it to other women with cervical cancer. Phelan also blew the whistle on a medical scandal: dozens of women with cervical cancer were not told that smear test results had wrongly given them a clean bill of health. Authorities withheld the revised test results for years. The revelations have shocked Ireland. An inquiry headed by Gabriel Scally, a public health expert, recently published a report detailing how the Health Service Executive (HSE), a state agency, outsourced screening to unapproved laboratories in the UK and US. There is no evidence the labs were sub-standard but Irish officials failed to keep track of them and had an \u201cinadequate\u201d system for responding to screening errors, the report said. An earlier report by the inquiry excoriated \u201cwhole-system failure\u201d and \u201cpaternalism\u201d in Irish healthcare. The findings have cast a shadow on the country\u2019s progressive sheen. Behind a humming economy and social liberalisation endure old habits of dysfunction, unaccountability and misogyny, according to Scally. Leo Varadkar, the country\u2019s first gay taoiseach, is under fire for his handling of the scandal. The government last week approved payments of \u20ac20,000 (\u00a317,790) each to at least 120 women who were not told their smear tests were audited for errors after they developed cancer. But the state claims agency has appealed a court ruling involving Ruth Morrissey, another woman with terminal cervical cancer who successfully sued the HSE and two laboratories. For Phelan, an academic administrator who lives in County Limerick, the problems began in 2011 when a smear test failed to detect abnormalities \u2013 a false negative. In 2014, worried by bleeding between periods, she went for another test. It detected cancer. She began treatment within weeks. An internal HSE review discovered the mistake made three years earlier, when treatment might have averted the disease. No one told Phelan until 2017. Then she learned the cancer was incurable. Phelan sued. In April 2018 she received a settlement of \u20ac2.5m (\u00a32.2m) without admission of liability from Clinical Pathology Laboratories, a Texas-based company sub-contracted to assess her test. Her case against the HSE was struck out. She resisted a gagging order and lifted the lid on the wider debacle. Inaccurate smear test results had been given to at least 208 women later diagnosed with cervical cancer. Most were not told about the revised results. Twenty are now dead. \u201cWe were the last people to be considered in all of this,\u201d said Phelan, speaking to the Guardian from Kilkee, a County Clare village overlooking the Atlantic where she was on holiday with her family. For documenting incompetence, buck-passing and paternalism in the treatment of women, the Scally inquiry has been called a watershed for Irish healthcare. \u201cWe\u2019re still second-class citizens,\u201d said Phelan. \u201cA lot of these gynaecologists feel like they\u2019re gods and that you can\u2019t question them \u2026 that you\u2019ve no right to ask questions about your own body.\u201d Change is under way. The HSE is implementing the inquiry\u2019s recommendations. The government has offered free out-of-cycle smear tests, leading to thousands of women being tested for the first time, at the price of creating a huge backlog. The publicity is credited with a surge in teenage girls getting the HPV vaccine that prevents some types of cervical cancer. Campaigners welcome all this but lament delays in establishing compensation, a tribunal and and independent review of the smear test saga. \u201cDespite over a year of work, the failings we are battling are still being uncovered,\u201d said 221+, a patient support group, last week. Phelan inhabits a strange limbo. Showered with awards, invited on chatshows, profiled in documentaries, she is Ireland\u2019s version of Erin Brockovich. But her terminal illness still ticks its countdown. Phelan does not know how long the pembrolizumab will tame the tumour. In September she will publish an autobiography, Overcoming, \u201cthe story of my life, one struggle after another,\u201d as she described it. At 19, Phelan was injured in a car accident that killed her boyfriend. It plunged her into depression. \u201cThat was the first thing that happened that made me realise life is not fair.\u201d Her daughter Amelia, now 13, was born with a genetic disorder affecting her eyesight. If the 2011 smear test result had been accurate, Phelan might have escaped cancer. \u201cI try not to go there too much because if I do I just get very angry. And if I go down that road it spirals into depression,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have time on my side. I\u2019d rather just enjoy what I have. I can\u2019t change it. But I can change it for other people.\u201d Irish people were belatedly learning to stand up for themselves, she said, first challenging the Catholic church and now the medical establishment. \u201cI have people who come up and say: \u2018Oh Vicky, you\u2019d be so proud, I asked my doctor a question today.\u2019 I love that.\u201d Phelan is funding a pilot project to give those diagnosed with terminal cancer a professional advocate, an expert who can advise on options including experimental treatments. \u201cIt\u2019s to give people a little bit of hope that there might be something out there. There isn\u2019t always, I know that. But you can\u2019t just send people home to die without a little bit of hope.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
