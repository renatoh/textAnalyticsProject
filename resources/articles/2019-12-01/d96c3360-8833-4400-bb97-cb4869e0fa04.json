The plans \u2013 which would only affect fares in England as those in Wales and Scotland are devolved \u2013 would also seek to ensure part-time workers do not have to pay more per journey than season ticket holders, while those aged 16 and under would get free rail travel. It comes a day after train operators announced an average 2.7% increase in rail fares in January, prompting dismay from passenger groups. The increase also affects regulated fares, about 40% of the total, including most commuter season tickets as well as some long distance off-peak fares and peak urban trips. Labour, which plans to renationalise the rail system over the long term, would cut these fares by 33% from January \u201cto tackle the crisis of unaffordability on the railways\u201d, with the party saying this would save the average commuter \u00a31,097 a year. For part-time workers, changes to the fare system would ensure they would not pay more on the trains per day than commuters with all-week season tickets, while those aged 16 and under would travel for free. The party is also promising \u201ca London-style ticketing system across the nation\u201d to simplify prices using zonal fares, which would be applied to all types of public transport, and allow contactless payments. Labour say these changes would cost about \u00a31.5bn per year. The funding would come from a wider change planned by the party to create a sustainable transport fund from the revenues bought in by vehicle excise duty, or VED, which is based on emissions. While income from a particular tax is not normally reserved by the government for use in a certain way, known as hypothecation, under an existing Conservative plan, from 2020 this would happen for VED, with the income reserved for road building and maintenance projects. VED is due to raise \u00a36.5bn in the 2019-20 financial year, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. Introducing the new rail fares policy, Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cTravelling by train is my favourite way of getting around the country but for too long a fragmented and privatised rail system has ripped off passengers. \u201cTaking back control of our railways is the only way to bring down fares and create a railway network that is fit for the future. Labour will bring about real change on the railways because we are on the side of passengers.\u201d Andy McDonald, the party\u2019s shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cPrivatisation has created one of the most complex, exploitative and expensive ticketing systems in the world. Labour will scrap the bewildering and outdated fares and ticketing system that discriminates against part-time workers, discourages rail travel and excludes the young and low paid.\u201d The announcement comes a day after Labour pledged a major increase in investment for walking and cycling journeys, with funding for active travel rising from \u00a37 to \u00a350 per person per year within the next parliament. Other ambitions for the five-year period include doubling the number of cycle trips, building 3,000 miles of safe Dutch-style bike lanes, and creating secure walking and cycling routes to 10,000 primary schools."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
