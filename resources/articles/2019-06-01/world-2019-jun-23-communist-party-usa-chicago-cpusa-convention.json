Communists from across the US, along with international delegates from Germany, Canada, Venezuela and elsewhere, sought to send the message that their party has been the most consistent champion of those ideas, has been on the right side of some of the most consequential ideological battles of the last hundred years, and is ready to continue the fight into its second century. \u201cWe are a party of action,\u201d said Chicago activist Pepe Lozano in an opening address on Friday. His father, Rudy Lozano, was an aldermanic candidate in the city in the early 1980s who rallied Mexican and Puerto Rican voters to support Harold Washington, the first African-American mayor. The elder Lozano was shot dead in 1983 in what supporters say was an assassination. \u201cWe are united,\u201d Lozano said. \u201cWe are determined. We are raring to fight.\u201d \u2018Inextricably intertwined\u2019 Communism has long been regarded with fear in the US, viewed as antithetical to American values and democracy. The US spent much of the 20th century in battle against it, seeking to contain it in Korea, Vietnam and elsewhere, hot wars fought as part of the cold war with the Soviet Union. Decades were spent attempting to root out communism at home, including during the first red scare following the first world war and the second red scare of the 1940s and 1950s, in which Senator Joseph McCarthy led \u201cinvestigations\u201d to out suspected communists in government and public life. Accusations of communism, as well as socialism, continue to be leveled by conservatives against mainstream liberal politicians, including Barack Obama. But there is also a long history of communism and radical leftwing politics in America, as leaders and attendees pointed out in Chicago. \u201cThe story of our communist party is inextricably intertwined with the development of the American working class and building its labor movement,\u201d Lozano said. \u201cOur roots are in the profound American struggles for democracy.\u201d Lozano cited party support for the civil rights and anti-war movements, for battles against police abuse and mass incarceration, and for drastic action to combat climate change including the Green New Deal proposed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the faces of the young democratic socialist movement within the Democratic party. To attend the CPUSA convention is in some ways to encounter familiar concerns and ideas. Attendees were animated by issues that 2020 presidential hopefuls have pushed to make part of the Democratic platform, including plans to address climate change, inequality and hawkish foreign policy \u2013 as well as opposition to Donald Trump, who has sought to \u201cdivide working people\u201d, attendees said. \u201cOur job as communists is to unite people,\u201d Ismael Parra, from Los Angeles, told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about people being joined together,\u201d said Tere Gonzalez, also from LA. Mainstream liberals would have found other elements of the convention less familiar. In a student center on the campus of University of Illinois Chicago, in a large hall past a Dunkin Donuts and a PNC bank, attendees invariably greeted one another as \u201ccomrade\u201d. A few wore apparel bearing a hammer and sickle. The convention began with the entire crowd enthusiastically singing This Land Is Your Land, Woody Guthrie\u2019s classic folk song. And while even some of the most progressive mainstream politicians, Elizabeth Warren among them, have bristled at the \u201csocialist\u201d label, it can be striking to hear Americans openly discuss their support for communism. \u201cNobody is better at beating red-baiting than the reds,\u201d Tyner joked, suggesting the Communist party could best defeat Republicans in 2020. \u2018Our victory is inevitable\u2019 While Tyner suggested during his speech that the party has differences with Ocasio-Cortez and others of the new wave of democratic socialists, that surge of progressive energy appeared to have emboldened the party and attracted new interest. People\u2019s World, the news outlet affiliated with CPUSA, has seen increased readership this year, editor-in-chief John Wojcik and managing editor CJ Atkins told the convention. Several guests were not members of the party, but at the convention to learn more about it. Timothy Faye, who is not a communist but is interested in leftist causes, came to Chicago from Rhode Island. While many older Americans may have a negative view of communism, he said, younger people like him may be more open to its message. \u201cThere\u2019s a leftward shift among young people,\u201d Faye told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of the economic environment people are in.\u201d The party seems to see an opportunity to build. \u201cTogether, we will win,\u201d Lozano said, concluding his speech. \u201cOur victory is inevitable. Viva the Communist party USA!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
