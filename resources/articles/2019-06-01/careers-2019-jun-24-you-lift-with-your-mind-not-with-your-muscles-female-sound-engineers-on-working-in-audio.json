When it comes to live shows, women are having to face discriminatory stereotypes that they \u201ccan\u2019t hack tour\u201d, that working on live tours is too physically and emotionally demanding, that it\u2019s very much a man\u2019s world. But a number of women have been making waves in the industry for years. Here, two engineers, who have worked with the likes of Blondie, the Subways and Arcade Fire, share their experiences of working on live shows. Beth O\u2019Leary Live sound technician and engineer Growing up in Ireland, the music scene wasn\u2019t very big and I wasn\u2019t used to big production shows, so it didn\u2019t occur to me that sound engineering could be a career path. I went to university in Sheffield to study zoology, but I got involved with club nights and music events at the students\u2019 union and ended up going into sound instead. I\u2019m a freelancer, so my work changes for every job. At the moment, I\u2019m a monitor engineer for Kylie Minogue \u2013 we do in-ear monitors and throughout the show I keep an eye on the band, make sure they\u2019re happy, and if they need anything changing, I\u2019ll sort that out. As a monitor engineer, my goal is for people to forget that I\u2019m there. If the gig goes well, the band forgets about me and can concentrate on putting on a good show. There\u2019s a lot of technical knowledge that you need, but everything can be learned. However, you can\u2019t just be a technical wizard \u2013 you need people skills because you\u2019re looking after a band. It can be very difficult to explain sounds \u2013 we\u2019re very visual. So you need to be able to interpret when a band member is saying: \u201cIt sounds a bit crunchy.\u201d That requires skill. There\u2019s something very satisfying about getting the sound right. When you see the crowd and how elated they can get just by hearing music, it\u2019s really rewarding. I like knowing I\u2019m part of that. And being able to work with the same bands every day is a real pleasure \u2013 that\u2019s what I love about tour. You get to know them, you get to know their music. If you\u2019re with the right group of people, tour is really fun. It\u2019s like a travelling circus with people who become your family. There\u2019s a lovely, welcoming crew for Minogue. But out of a technical crew of 41, there are three women. And that\u2019s good by touring standards. I think a lot of people say it\u2019s just that women aren\u2019t interested. And a lot of people say we need to encourage women into Stem subjects, but I think that\u2019s just passing the buck on to the next generation. There\u2019s plenty of women who tried to make it in the industry and just gave up and left. I\u2019ve even questioned why I\u2019m still here at times. Most people are lovely and supportive, and while the whole industry is getting more inclusive, there is still sexism \u2013 both personal and systemic. There\u2019s no innate reason why women don\u2019t hack it on tour. It usually involves heavy lifting, but in this day and age of risk assessments and manual handling training, that is becoming more manageable, too. There\u2019s not that many women on tour because it\u2019s competitive and there aren\u2019t enough women coming in in the first place. Sometimes women aren\u2019t made to feel welcome, so they\u2019re either not getting the opportunity to go on tour, or if they\u2019re quitting it\u2019s because someone\u2019s made life difficult for them. It\u2019s definitely going in the right direction, but there\u2019s a long way to go to improve diversity in the technical world \u2013 even though there\u2019s more diversity on stage now. Kim Watson Sound engineer From 2008 onwards, I\u2019ve just been pretty much on the road. I\u2019ll do everything from front-of-house sound \u2013 which is what everyone hears \u2013 to sound monitoring, which is what the band hears. I did studio stuff early on, but repeating the same songs over and over again got boring \u2013 whereas live sound is very instantaneous. There\u2019s much more energy to it. It\u2019s more exciting. And as a monitor engineer, you\u2019re on the side of the stage with the band, so you see a show you wouldn\u2019t normally see. I\u2019ve been on tour with Blondie, Emeli Sand\u00e9 and the Subways, but my guilty pleasure is progressive rock shows \u2013 I once toured the Pink Floyd tribute band, and listening to that music every day was wonderful. One of the reasons I got into this was because I didn\u2019t want to pay for gig tickets all the time. I started when I was 19. I did music production at college and from there met a sound company, and I was taken on and had a mentor for a long time. Once I started working for him, I knew this was exactly what I wanted to be doing. He taught me: you lift with your mind, not with your muscles. He was right. In the early days, the equipment was a lot heavier, but now there\u2019s a lot less of it and it\u2019s less heavy, which has given women a lot more access to this side of the industry. I can fly a whole PA system pretty much on my own now, without the help of a crew. A lot of that has really helped because, back then, I was assumed to be a colleague\u2019s girlfriend, or just somebody he was hanging out with. People didn\u2019t think I was part of the team. I\u2019ve been literally pushed out of the way for a guy to jump on the desk. As a young woman, there was a lot of that, and I think a lot of women would quit over that. The physical and emotional demands of tour plays both ways to both men and women. Especially in the music industry at the moment, conversations about mental health are becoming very public. I think for a long time there had been a lot of denial about this, but more recently support is coming through. Touring is a lot of work, it\u2019s very intense and very fast. Days are normally from 9am to midnight or 1am. There\u2019s a lot of downtime after tour and then a lot of work. And we have a thing called \u201ctour comedown\u201d: you come back from tour \u2013 where everything is very regimented \u2013 and you\u2019ve got to kind of readjust to real life. The support hasn\u2019t always been there. Now the industry is becoming more professional \u2013 I think it\u2019s because of the introduction of women. I\u2019ve earned respect. Mostly, engineers will come in and go: \u201cAh, it\u2019s you, Kim, you\u2019re looking after us today.\u201d I\u2019ve become known for being a good engineer.
