Claude Devilliers beckoned me over to a smelly recess in the corner of his farmyard. The goats, he explained, used to roam all over the yard, but they had eaten all the flowers and made a nuisance of themselves. Then he reached into a pile of hay and extracted two day-old goslings. \"Pour le Noel,\" he explained, putting them out of reach of the cat. M Devilliers explained that he had taken over the remains of the disused fort at Montlandon, which dates from the 1880s, a few years ago. The former munitions stores made excellent pens for his calves, goats and poultry, and the fort was big enough to accommodate a large dining room and the odd guest. His wife Lucienne made the cheeses and prepared various other delicacies - dandelion jam, chutneys and preserves - and anyone who rang in advance was welcome to come along and taste them. I've eaten plenty of goats' cheese, some of it very good. But no one had ever offered me four different kinds, washed down with a pale Pinot Noir and local cider, and then shown me the goats that had produced them. The smell was overwhelming: the goats, most of them engaged in a battle with the fence of their large pen, bad-tempered. I retreated hastily. Before I left for Champagne-Ardenne - which lies to the east of Paris, sandwiched between Burgundy and Alsace-Lorraine - I had, as usual, consulted my Larousse Gastronomique. Some people like the folksy Routard guides. Others prefer the deadpan verdicts of their Michelin Red Guide. Most think LG is a turgid, snobbish affair, but they're missing the point. You might as well complain that Mrs Beeton's napkin-folding techniques are more trouble than a paper serviette. True, the concise edition lacks some of the juicier entries (le chat, for instance), LG is still full of advice for the unwary traveller. Unlike Britain, where the terms \"pub food\" and \"Pizza Express\" mean the same in every town, France has a cuisine du terroir - regional specialities. So it was with some excitement that I looked up Champagne-Ardenne. The verdict was, to be frank, a bit disappointing. \"Famous throughout the world for its wines,\" LG opined, \"Champagne-Ardenne is not, however, noted for its exceptional gastronomy.\" This was, it explained, chiefly the fault of foreign invaders who had disturbed the region's culinary progression. LG suggested trying the pease pudding, pink Reims biscuits, dandelion and bacon salad, pike, vine snails and andouillette de Troyes. Andouillette! I had first encountered this horrific dish on a holiday in the French Alps. Only the French could honour a boiled tripe sausage with such a glorious name. As it turned out, I didn't come across a single slice of andouillette during my afternoon in Troyes. I was, however, promised a cookery lesson from Daniel Baudesson, owner of Au Vieux Logis near Troyes and a past winner of the France's Best Worker title. M Baudesson turned out to be a diligent, bespectacled man who described himself as a \"disciple of Escoffier\". (Auguste Escoffier invented peach melba. He was also the creator of a remarkable dish called chaud-froid Jeannette, which commemorates a ship trapped in ice). Escoffians tend to be enthusiastic in their application of butter and cream. So it proved with M Baudesson. \"Oh, I can almost feel it piling on to my thighs!\" exclaimed a member of our party, as he fed an enormous chunk of butter into a food-processor. Melted into basil and tomato, it would accompany the red mullet we had just carefully filleted with tweezers. Poor Escoffier: liposuction had never been thought of when he invented his cuisses de nymphe aurore - frogs' legs, of the most delicate kind. Before long the kitchen was bustling. The butcher delivered a dozen chickens, their heads still on, which the chef promptly stowed in a fridge. We tackled his recipe for apple and walnut tarts, which baked them in foil cartons for us to take home. In a couple of seconds, he fashioned a button mushroom into a tiny grey rose. (I hid my own mushroom, gouged and sweating, in the pocket of my chef's apron).He showed us how to transform a single chive stem into a frond for decorating an extraordinarily creamy dollop of mashed potato. After watching him deal with a couple of dozen duck fillets and knock up a red wine sauce to accompany them, we left M Baudesson to deal with the pre-lunch rush. The Baudessons' cat, protesting loudly, was carried upstairs by the waitress. Their boxer stretched out on the doormat. We hadn't really cooked our own lunch, of course. But it was a pleasant illusion which the chef and his wife, who joined us at the table, did nothing to dispel. Four courses later, and still digesting the seven exquisite portions of the night before at the Michelin-starred Auberge de la Montagne in Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises, we were reluctantly dragged away to a champagne house. Seven courses? Let's break off here, before the champagne, to contemplate the prospect of seven courses. Is it gluttonous? Perhaps. But think of it as a quail's egg, a small Kilner jar wrapped in a napkin and containing a few morsels of lobster, a tender little piece of pike, a delicate mushroom amuse-bouche in a tiny ramekin, a sliver of tart with a mango coulis, a pungent whiff of Langres cheese, and a chocolate truffle - served over more than three hours, and it seems far less intimidating. I was still sober enough to text my boyfriend with details of each course before I fell into a peaceful sleep. Just don't try it in Savoie, where the cheese is viscous and sticks to your stomach for days afterwards. My knowledge of champagne was limited. I had once attended a thoroughly enjoyable event sponsored by Veuve Clicquot, and I knew I liked biscuity Krug; a generous friend had broken open his collection for Millennium Eve. I could recognise Piper-Heidsieck and at a distance, and knew I would like Laurent-Perrier and Bollinger if I could only afford to taste a few more of them. I had never heard of Drappier, which was General de Gaulle's favourite wine. (De Gaulle devotees can also visit his memorial, the giant and forbidding double cross perched on a hilltop near Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises; it is sad, now, to see posters of Jean-Marie Le Pen grinning from road signs and farm machinery all over the region). The Drappier champagne, for all its crispness and bite, didn't quite match the glorious Krug. But the sight of thousands of bottles, some stacked in a vast pile, others being corked and labelled on the production line, the rest \"riddled\" - or turned very slightly every day to bring the sediment into the mouth of the bottle, where it is flash-frozen and removed - and the explanation of exactly where the bubbles come from is worth an hour of anyone's time. Champagne bought directly from the vineyard is about half the price of a bottle bought in Britain, so if your car is large enough and the celebration big enough, there are substantial savings to be made. Pike, I have discovered, is a sublime fish in the right hands; dandelion jam is surprisingly refreshing, especially on sourdough bread; and tomato sauces need plenty of mati\u00bfres grasses, as the French call them, to bring out their flavour. Let me go back, and I'd save up enough to stay at the Champ des Oiseaux hotel in Troyes. I'd take binoculars and decipher the stained glass in the cathedral - a Sainte Chapelle in miniature, but without the crowds or the entry fee. After all, food isn't everything. Well, not quite. \"The discovery of a new dish does more for human happiness than the discovery of a new star,\" the gastronome Brillat-Savarin wrote in 1825. He did have a point. &amp;149; Ros Taylor travelled to Champagne-Ardenne courtesy of Eurotunnel and stayed and ate at the Auberge de la Montagne in Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises, Le Cheval Blanc in Langres and Au Vieux Logis in Brevonnes (all bookable via Logis de France) and the Hotel Le Saint Nicolas in Bar Sur Aube. Directions to the former fort at Montlandon can be found on the Haute Marne site. She drank at Champagne Drappier. Other champagne houses can be found at Champagne.fr. Troyes and its famous andouillette have their own websites."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
