The US president has previously asserted that he has the power to demote Powell but denied that he had threatened to do so. Speaking on Wednesday in an interview with Fox Business Network, Trump appeared to mock Powell, whom he chose to chair the Fed. Trump said: \u201cHe\u2019s decided to prove how tough he is, because he\u2019s not going to get pushed around? Here\u2019s a guy, nobody ever heard of him before. And now, I made him, and he wants to show how tough he is. OK. Let him show how tough he is. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing a good job.\u201d He added that the Fed\u2019s policy of raising interest rates and cutting back on its bond-buying quantitative easing had gone too far and was \u201cinsane\u201d. Trump also suggested that Mario Draghi, the outgoing president of the European Central Bank, would be a better leader of the Fed than Powell. The Fed makes its decisions independently from the White House, but Trump has broken with decades of precedent in directly criticising interest rate rises. Higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow, slowing down economic growth. Trump said on Monday that without the Fed\u2019s rate rises the Dow Jones industrial average stock market index would be \u201cthousands of points higher\u201d. He also suggested annual economic growth would have reached 4% or 5% \u2013 above the 3.1% annual rate reported by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis for the first quarter of the year. Trump also raised fears of a new front in his trade disputes with multiple countries, saying Vietnam was \u201calmost the single worst abuser\u201d of the US on trade. The Trump White House has already imposed or threatened major tariffs on China, the EU and Mexico. He said: \u201cVietnam takes advantage of us even worse than China.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
