As we have reported previously, in a confidential out-of-court settlement last year, an agreed joint statement was issued by Trafigura and lawyers representing the claimants in the Ivory Coast, which confirmed the conclusions reached by scientific experts appointed in the case. The joint statement described the consequences of the waste dumping as at worst being \"low-level\" illness, as opposed to deaths, miscarriages or more serious injuries. We apologise for our error. \u2022\u2008A piece about the proposed Wear bridge \u2013 Fingers crossed for England's tallest bridge, 1 May, page 23 \u2013 mentioned that \"Labour is involved in a battle to defend Sunderland South from a Tory challenge\". That should have been Sunderland Central. \u2022\u2008An article sited London \"a few hundred miles south\" of Rochdale, when the distance as the crow flies is about 170 miles (She only nipped out for a loaf \u2013 but left Brown in a right jam, 29 April, page 2). \u2022\u2008A column on songs about birds referred to Olivier Messiaen's L'Alouette Lulu as a skylark. Lullula arborea is a woodlark, the skylark is Alauda arvensis. An accompanying playlist misspelled the composer as Messaien (Readers recommend, 30 April, page 4, Film &amp; Music).
