The foul throw happened as a result of him slipping before the ball left his hands, which made it an incorrectly taken throw-in. So stop play and order a re taken throw. Thanks to Duncan Turton. 2) You cannot allow a player to benefit from cheating \u2013 and if he hadn't taken the dramatic leap he would not have been in the position to nudge the ball into the net. So disallow the goal, caution the forward for unsporting behaviour and re start with an indirect free -kick to the defending team. David Fisher wins the shirt. 3) Cheating does not get more obvious than this. Show him a second yellow, followed by a red. And the substitution is cancelled: it is not complete until the player leaving the field has stepped over the touchline, and the player joining the game has entered the pitch. If the team still want to make a change, then they need to pick a new outfield player to take off . Thanks to Daniel Hughes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
