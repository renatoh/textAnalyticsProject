For that time, there was a seriously false market in Marconi shares, subsequently proved by the fact that as soon as trading was resumed investors dumped them, with a resulting 54 per cent loss in value. QED. The board misled the market. But the FSA's conclusions about those extraordinary hours do not stack up. The deputy chief executive, John Mayo, was away on business, and therefore could not be blamed. The chairman and chief executive, Lord Simpson and Sir Roger Hurn, simply could not believe the figures coming in, and wanted to check with Mayo. They too cannot be blamed. So an entity called Marconi carries the can, and, by good timing, escapes with a slap on the wrist. If it had happened six months later, hefty fines would have been handed out, the FSA implies. We'll have to give the benefit of the doubt this time, but the FSA must learn two crucial lessons for the 'next' Marconi: get the report out quicker, and make sure your lawyers are as good as the opposition's. Furse choice I was right, and wrong, about the new chairman of the London Stock Exchange. Chris Gibson-Smith is a relative unknown, with little attachment to the City's financial establishment, as I predicted. But he is so obviously not American that I feel I owe some small apologies. Still, he is as global as they come, with years of service in the US and China on behalf of BP, so that is one of the LSE's boxes ticked. (Paris and Frankfurt may note, however, that his CV seems to ignore them almost completely.) For the Government, who obviously had a say in the appointment, he proved he could negotiate the corridors of power with his time at Nats (air traffic control), during which he effectively came up with a rescue plan when Whitehall's original scheme was on the point of failure. And his trusteeship of the Institute for Public Policy Research will do him no harm in leftish circles. For the City, there is the small crumb of comfort that he was a non-executive at Lloyds TSB for a year or so. But it could have been worse for the Square Mile - it could have been our very own Paul Myners, who, as chairman of Guardian Media Group, is... ahem... not a favourite of that old boy network. Gibson-Smith is to spend the next few weeks getting accustomed to the set-up at the LSE, which in effect means he will have series of long chats with Clara Furse, the single-minded chief executive. Despite the accusations of inertia and complacency, she has a very definite view of the LSE's future, and it does not include precipitous mergers with French, Germans or Americans. This is another lady not for turning. Furse can see no benefit from any such link-up, and will resist blandishments from any who approach her with schemes that bring neither financial nor technological advantage for LSE shareholders. She has been saying this for so long that it is time we all got the message: if you cannot join them, beat them. If he knows what's good for him, Gibson-Smith should have that motto prominently displayed on his desk. Rick's wreck Rick Haythornthwaite has been dealt an awful hand at Invensys, the unwieldy engineer that has stumbled from one crisis to another for nearly a decade. He is a shrewd businessman, but as chief executive of Invensys, he may have met his nemesis. Debt stands at about \u00a31.5 billion, but the company is valued on the stock market at just \u00a3360 million after one profits warning too many. It has suffered the humiliation of being ejected from the FTSE 100. The trading outlook is poor, and if Invensys is not to breach its banking covenants later this year, it must sell yet more assets. Haythornthwaite will doubtless indicate as much when he delivers a trading update this week. Businesses worth around \u00a3700m could come under the hammer - energy management and rail look likely to go; as for Baan, its loss-making software subsidiary, word on the street is that it could eventually close. But will all this be enough to save Invensys? I doubt it. It looks as though the old BTR, that odd 1980s conglomerate created by Sir Owen Green, will go the way of Marconi and ICI. BBC won It is a clich\u00e9 that in times of crisis, we turn to the BBC for information, analysis, even reassurance. Figures from pollster ICM, commissioned by the Beeb and obtained exclusively by Observer Business, prove the point. More viewers chose the BBC - some 60 per cent - than any other broadcaster for their coverage of the Iraq war. Radio listeners voted even more overwhelmingly, with 78 per cent tuning in to one BBC station or another for war coverage. The BBC Online website recorded 162 million hits in the first week of the war - almost double the rate of the week following September 11 2001. Even in homes with Sky Digital, the BBC led the way, with 50 per cent opting to follow the war on a BBC channel, against 37 per cent choosing Sky News. Sky has been rightly praised by fellow media professionals for the editorial quality of its war coverage, but with the viewing public the BBC is still way ahead. And we still trust the BBC, despite all the criticism of Iraq reporting. Some 57 per cent said they trusted the BBC to report the truth, against 31 per cent for ITV and 14 per cent for Sky. So there is a proper way to do serious news. Piers Morgan, please note."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
