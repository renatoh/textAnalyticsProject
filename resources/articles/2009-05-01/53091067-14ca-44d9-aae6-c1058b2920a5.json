But it is not just celebrities who are opting to turn up to festivals, clubs and gigs in outlandish outfits. Fancy dress retailers are reporting a surge in sales this year as dressing up \u2013 and looking ridiculous rather than cool or chic \u2013 becomes 2009's most fashionable choice. While many costumes are home-made, Angels Fancy Dress has seen a huge increase in interest in medical costumes, with sales of stethoscopes and other doctor's accessories up 37% year on year. There has also been a 22% increase in sales of Miss Muffet outfits and 35% for Snow White. \"Lily Allen has become a poster girl for the trend in eccentric and quirky fancy dress, but she didn't start it,\" says Emma Angel of Angels. \"Since the start of the recession, we've seen a trend in online and in-store sales of flamboyant and humorous costumes. Lily has tapped into the need for escapist fun.\" Allen is set to judge the annual fancy-dress competition at September's Bestival. The music festival is renowned for its themed dress code and crazily costumed festival-goers: the winner of this year's \"space oddity\" theme receives Bestival tickets for life. But this year others are following suit. Last week a Facebook page went up inviting people to a flash mob fancy-dress party at Glastonbury's stone circle during the annual music festival next month. And it is not only festivals. Last week, when model Heidi Klum renewed her wedding vows with the singer Seal, they chose a \"white-trash\" wedding theme \u2013 with a mullet wig for Seal and a cheap lace dress for Klum \u2013 over typical black tie. And when Allen performed a secret gig in London on Monday, the singer and her fans dressed to a Tube station theme. She was (Queen) Victoria, while fans gave their fanciful interpretations of Elephant &amp; Castle, Angel and Paddington. Tobias Slater, singer with the band Tough Love and organiser of the costume extravaganza White Mischief club nights, says that dressing up is a phenomenon. \"I've had a few fashion insiders tell me it's all old hat, but it's getting bigger and bigger. Dressing as a more fantastic version of yourself or as a completely different being \u2013 such as a panda \u2013 seems a prerequisite of going to a club or a festival at the moment.\" Tough Love started the White Mischief nights to create an atmospheric backdrop for their gigs, but the vaudevillian acts that started performing alongside the band and the audience's costumes have now taken the evenings to another level. The next event will be held next weekend at London's Scala club and the 1,100-capacity venue is already sold out. \"We have one guy who wears a copper ship on his head and nothing else,\" says Slater. \"You see the most incredible furs and feathers; it's exquisite. Fancy dress is not compulsory at White Mischief, but people really push the boat out. It's still an incredibly friendly atmosphere, though. The oldest person we've had in was 83. We had three generations of clubbers at one night.\" Even at private parties, fancy dress is becoming more popular. Dan Rusby, a 30-year-old patent lawyer who lives in London, says that his love of fancy dress has grown as he has got older. \"Going to parties dressed in something ridiculous makes things more fun. It gets rid of the pretension of fashion and trying to be beautiful.\" Though Rusby has been to Bestival as a tennis player, and spent New Year's Eve dressed as a kingfisher, his favourite costume was a Roman centurion. He made the outfit himself, making his helmet out of a bike helmet and a broom-head that was painted gold. Sophia Martelli, a writer in her thirties who has attended a cross-dressing party in the country and a voodoo night in a London flat, says costumes alter the way you feel. \"They're the older person's equivalent of drugs \u2013 if you have an elaborate enough costume, it takes you out of yourself and you end up talking to random people all night about their attire,\" says Martelli, who makes her outfits, putting them together from charity shops. Many others are already preparing their outfits for the summer festival season \u2013 the Shangri La area at Glastonbury is offering a slumbarave for dancers in pyjamas and dressing gowns and a rockabilly-themed diner, while the Wickerman festival in July is themed around animalia in honour of The Wicker Man film. Radio 1 DJ Rob da Bank, who organises Bestival and Camp Bestival, thinks costumes add to the escapist fun. \"As soon as you don your outfit, you forget who you really are, whether you're a 4-year-old in a Superman outfit or a 50-year-old dressed as a jellyfish.\" He says the only problem the costumes have caused came in 2006, when they picked a clown theme. \"We had to cancel the theme as so many people complained of coulrophobia \u2013 fear of clowns; we didn't know it was the second biggest phobia after spiders. The Scissor Sisters still came on dressed as scary clowns, complete with 10 giant clowns on stilts. Good effort!\" He is looking forward to this year's contest and is sure that one of the home-made costumes will bag the award. \"The Bestival fancy-dress crew are hardcore; they have meetings at each other's houses and spend months making their costumes. One of those loonies will win,\" he says. As White Mischief's Slater says, these days fancy dress is more than just a costume. \"People want to dress up and be outrageous even in the midst of the credit crunch \u2013 perhaps even because of the credit crunch. This is a moment when people want escapism and to imagine themselves in another world. When you dress up, you're not just at a show \u2013 you are the show.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
