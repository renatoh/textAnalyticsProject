Mario Melchiot, having contributed heavily to the goal that allowed West Brom to procure a precious equaliser here the previous Saturday, was the chief protagonist in another dreadful defensive blunder that gifted Spurs the platform for a rare away win. The Birmingham full-back ought to have cleared but instead foolishly sought to shepherd the ball out of play, allowing the alert Jermain Defoe to set up Aaron Lennon for his first Tottenham goal. Home fans made their frustration known, heckling Melchiot's every touch thereafter, though more misery was to follow when Robbie Keane tapped home a second with 12 minutes remaining. Victory allowed Spurs to reclaim their place in the top four, lost temporarily to Arsenal after their win over Charlton earlier in the day, though it was the outcome at another match that sent a shudder through the spines of Birmingham supporters. Portsmouth's unexpected triumph over a weakened West Ham side means they are suddenly a threat to Birmingham's chances of avoiding relegation. Tottenham, chastened by last Saturday's loss at Chelsea, arrived eager to avoid back-to-back defeats for the first time in the equivalent of a full Premiership season - a measure of their consistency since Martin Jol took over. The Spurs manager believes that 15 points will be sufficient to secure a Champions League berth though such forecasts appear dangerous in light of Arsenal's resurgent form. Birmingham require a similar haul merely to survive. Steve Bruce's side have found injuries easier to come by than points this season, and although Kenny Cunningham returned for the first time in five weeks here after recovering from a groin strain, the Birmingham manager was again forced to select from a depleted squad. The absence of five first-team regulars, including Chris Sutton, prompted Bruce to give DJ Campbell a first start since joining from Brentford in January. The diminutive forward might have marked his full debut with a goal inside 10 minutes but for the outstretched leg of Michael Dawson. Emile Heskey, running on to Melchiot's slide-rule pass, advanced beyond Ledley King, not for the first time, and rifled a low ball across the face of the Tottenham goal. Hovering at the back post, Campbell appeared poised to prod home only for Dawson to intervene. That chance served to encourage Birmingham, however, after Spurs had initially made the brighter start. Maik Taylor stooped low to gather a Michael Carrick free-kick after only three minutes while the movement and pace of Keane and Defoe, making a rare start together in attack, prompted consternation in the Birmingham defence. If Defoe's presence was unsettling for Birmingham, it was reassuring for the watching Sven-Goran Eriksson who had this week expressed concern at the Spurs striker's lack of match practice. Once was a time when Eriksson might have travelled to run the rule over Heskey, though those days have long passed. His shortcomings as a striker were well illustrated by the heavy first touch that allowed a presentable chance to slip from his grasp. Jamie Clapham's long pass exposed King's poor positioning but Heskey, despite running clear, allowed Robinson to gather after he failed to control. Tottenham were clearly unsettled. Though they threatened on the counterattack through the athletic Jermaine Jenas and tricky Aaron Lennon, Birmingham enjoyed the greater possession. Their high-tempo approach contrasted markedly with last weekend's listless display against West Bromwich Albion and gave Spurs no chance to settle. Heskey squandered another opening three minutes before the break when he miscued from close range, while at the opposite end Keane was denied on the stroke of half-time by Melchiot's welltimed block after Jenas, racing on to Lennon's pass, crossed from the right. Further chances followed for Spurs shortly after the restart. First Defoe, linking well with Keane, saw his rasping drive tipped over, while seconds later Michael Dawson had strong grounds for a penalty when his 12-yard shot appeared to strike the arm of Nicky Butt before Taylor saved. The breakthrough duly arrived, however, when Lennon drilled home after Melchiot's mistake, leaving Keane to put the match beyond Tottenham's reach after Jenas gambolled forward on the right. Man of the match - Jermaine Jenas An energetic display from the midfielder that will have no doubt pleased the watching England coach. Jenas' athleticism allowed him to break forward with purpose, as he did to create Tottenham's second goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
