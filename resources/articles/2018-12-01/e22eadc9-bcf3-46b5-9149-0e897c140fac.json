Thank you for joining in - I\u2019ll be back next week for the GRAND FINAL, when Ashley, Stacey, Faye and Joe will take a final spin in pursuit of the Strictly Glitterball. Pretty sure we predicted that final four in about Week 3, and I have high hopes for some great dancing. Kick off is a 6.30pm next Saturday, so I\u2019ll see you then! Have a great week, Hx Lauren and AJ take to the floor to dance their final dance to Whitney\u2019s \u2018Didn\u2019t We Almost Have It All\u2019. Alright, don\u2019t rub it in. \u201cIt\u2019s always been about ability, not disability,\u201d says AJ. They\u2019ve been an extraordinary partnership, and what a journey for Lauren. Felt like those words from both of them were truly heartfelt, bit dusty in here. Obviously all the judges vote for Ashley and Pasha, which means LAUREN AND AJ are going home. They\u2019ve been phenomenal contestants \u2013 Lauren has grown in confidence and style every week, and AJ has shown what a great teacher and choreographer he is. I\u2019ve loved watching them every week, and they\u2019re hugely worthy semi-finalists. And now time for Lauren and AJ\u2019s Tango. This is considerably better than last night, with a good deal fewer mistakes. Sadly it won\u2019t be enough, but lovely for Lauren to go out having nailed that routine. First up in the dance off it\u2019s Ashley and Pasha! I loved this American Smooth last night, am very happy to watch it again. It\u2019s still gorgeous, albeit the one-legged lift didn\u2019t look quite as confident. Faye is having a cry - for their Showdance they\u2019re doing something elegant and sophisticated. Yeah I want that from a Waltz, not a Showdance. Another montage! I\u2019m really looking forward to next week\u2019s final - it\u2019s going to be a corker. It feels like a while since we last had a dance off featuring any kind of \u2018who will it be?\u2019 tension, doesn\u2019t it? Alas tonight is not going to change that. On the upside, we get to watch Pashley\u2019s American Smooth again, and their Showdance next week will be EPIC \u2013 I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing it. So who is joining Ashley and Pasha in the bottom two? If it\u2019s Faye, things are going to get interesting. If it\u2019s Lauren, not so much. In the bottom two: LAUREN AND AJ, which means Faye and Giovanni are through to the final! Time for a judges\u2019 montage - think of it as a warm up for next week. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of the world\u2019s greatest girl band, Little Mix (yes they are, don\u2019t @ me), Sadly they\u2019re singing \u2018Woman Like Me\u2019, which is a shameless rip off of Ariana Grande\u2019s \u2018Side To Side\u2019 and very much not my favourite Little Mix banger. That said, I am very much enjoying this season\u2019s Bonkers Workwear Collection from Zara and the all-female band and dancer combo. Dianne has revealed that Joe will be a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll Fred Astaire in their Showdance, which is ... interesting. And of course he has to dye his hair to match Dianne\u2019s, as he promised at the beginning. Meanwhile Kevin is planning \u2018the most ambitious thing ever done on Strictly\u2019. He wants that glitterball BAD. So who is through to next week\u2019s GRAND FINAL? First couple through is JOE AND DIANNE. Behold the Joe Sugg fandom. Joining him will be STACEY AND KEVIN! Well, obviously First couple in the dance off: ASHLEY AND PASHA. I feel for Ashley \u2013 it must be hard to smash it every week and still know that the public isn\u2019t behind you. I hope she knows that it isn\u2019t personal. Last night on Strictly: TWO DANCES. A traditional semi-final mix of the under-rehearsed and the overmarked. Stacey and Kevin were the shining stars of the evening, and also loved Pashley\u2019s American Smooth and Joe\u2019s and Dianne\u2019s Viennese Waltz. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a black pantsuit with feathery boobs, Claudia in sparkly snakeskin. Tonight\u2019s opening pro routine features Graziano in yet another shirt without buttons. There\u2019s lots of dramatic contempo-wafting in a red room to a rather strangled version of \u2018In My Blood\u2019 by Shawn Mendes. The room has limited furniture, but it does have a fridge. OK that was all a bit weird. And we\u2019re off! Only two weeks of these credits left, so give those BA BA BAs some welly. Before I forget, doesn\u2019t anyone want an blog for the Strictly Christmas Special? Obviously I\u2019ll be in no fit state to do a liveblog on Christmas Day, but in previous years we\u2019ve opened a thread where you can all comment and chat amongst yourselves while the festive edition is on. I can ask for this to be set up if you\u2019d like, let me know in the comments or on Twitter @heidistephens. Evening all, and welcome back to this year\u2019s semi-final results show! Tonight we find out who our four fabulous finalists are, and enjoy our final Sunday night liveblog of the season. I will miss this madness, but am equally looking forward to occasionally having one of those Sunday lunches which become afternoon tea and suddenly it\u2019s 8pm and you\u2019re still in the pub thinking about dinner. So who is going to be? Whichever way I spin the numbers I can\u2019t see Lauren making it through \u2013 she would require top votes from the public to stay out of the bottom two, which I really don\u2019t think is going to happen. The big question is whether Joe will be in the dance off too, or will the Youtube fandom/North Wilts Massive send him sailing through to the Grand Final? And if so, who else is in the dance off? Not Stacey, so maybe Ashley again, despite being at the top of the leader board? Or even Faye? It feels mad, but it could happen. Kick off is at 7.15pm, so grab a big mug of tea and your loved ones, and I\u2019ll see you then! So who is going out tomorrow? Lauren has to be in the danger zone, but will the fandom save Joe? Join me at 7.15pm tomorrow and we\u2019ll find out \u2013 thank you so much for joining in and being brilliant and hilarious as always. Enjoy the rest of your Saturday! Hx So that\u2019s it for the dancing! Pashley and Fayovanni are joint top of the leaderboard, with Joe and Lauren at the bottom. The voting lines are open! Time for a recap - my faves tonight were Stacey and Kevin \u2013 I\u2019d give them a vote for being great, plus two votes for Joe and Dianne for being the local choice. Becks is giving two votes to Stacey and Kevin and one to Ashley and Pasha. Scores: 9,10,10,10 - a total of 39 for Faye and Giovanni. Bruno uses ALL the metaphors, and it had the kind of musicality he rarely sees. Craig thought it had a clumsy moment, but Darcey loved the intense drama, and Giovanni gave her the freedom to express those lines. Shirley thought it was outstanding, and she is in love with Faye\u2019s beautiful ankles and feet. Niche. Well, this is more like it. Faye is the sexiest purple Quality Street known to man or woman, and this is a nice effort. A few balance issues, but some nice flicky leg action, and Giovanni is doing a great job of showcasing Faye. Would have liked a bit more intensity and Argentine filth, but great work. And finally, it\u2019s FAYE AND GIOVANNI! Their second dance is the Argentine Tango to \u2018La Cumparsita\u2019 by Machiko Ozawa. They\u2019ve taken a huge risk this evening with two hugely complex dances, but hopefully they\u2019ve put the effort into this one rather than the Samba earlier. Scores: 5,6,6,6 - a total of 23 for Lauren and AJ. Too many mistakes for Shirley too, there were lots of times when Lauren was on the wrong foot. Bruno really felt for Lauren, but she made it to the end. Craig thought it was a real shame, and sadly Lauren didn\u2019t manage to cover it up by over-acting. Darcey agrees \u2013 this really wasn\u2019t Lauren\u2019s best night. So much beige in those outfits. This isn\u2019t giving me much hope, to be honest. They are on a boat, but it\u2019s definitely not rocking. In fact, it\u2019s barely left port. Nice soft knees from Lauren, but it all feels a bit tentative and there are quite a few mistakes and timing issues. Not her greatest effort, sadly. Next up it\u2019s LAUREN AND AJ! Their second dance is a Samba to \u2018Rock The Boat\u2019 by The Hues Corporation. I love this song, and have an inexplicable affection for the Samba, so very much hoping Lauren has downed three Caiprinhas and is ready to shake it. Scores: 10,10,10,10 - a perfect score for Ashley and Pasha. \u201cI love Pasha, but he doesn\u2019t believe in climate change\u201d, says Becks. I have so many questions, but no time to ask them. Darcey loved the shaping, it was glamorous with lovely fluid arms. Shirley thought it was stunning on every level, and Bruno thought the lifts were out of this world. Craig applauds, and has been rendered speechless. Tens all round, anyone? Well this is marvellous - full of charm and joy. More teeth-aching sweetness and quite a lot of Ashley\u2019s knickers, but some great lifts and outstanding dance quality. Good work. It\u2019s time for ASHLEY AND PASHA! Their second dance is an American Smooth to \u2018Ain\u2019t That a Kick In The Head\u2019 by Dean Martin. I\u2019ve been waiting for a Pashley Smooth, and fully expect this to be a picture-perfect affair packed with style, elegance and old-school Hollywood glamour. Scores: 6,8,8,8 - a total of 30 for Joe and Dianne. Craig thought it was too stompy and placed, and he didn\u2019t feel that Joe was leading the dance. ARGENTINE HARD FOR A MAN DRINK. Darcey wanted it to be more aggressive and less attentive. Shirley doesn\u2019t agree - it had lots of great qualities. Bruno could see how much work Joe has put in (DRINK), but it needed a bit of nastiness. Tess just called Joe adorable - DRINK. And that\u2019s a full house on this week\u2019s bingo! Well done everyone. Peaky Blinder Joe is mopping his sweaty neck, and for good reason. Mostly he\u2019s a pole for Dianne to dance round, but it has some lovely pacing and storytelling. His sticky-out bum has made a comeback, but this still has a nice quality to it. Not sure how much of that was actual Argentine Tango, but quite enjoyed it. Next up it\u2019s JOE AND DIANNE! Their second dance this evening is an Argentine Tango to \u2018Red Right Hand\u2019 by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. This could either be the defining moment where Joe morphs into a macho gancho sex god, or three minutes of Dianne wrestling a deck chair. Scores: 8,9,10,9 - a total of 36 for Stacey and Kevin. And now suddenly Bruno is the voice of reason. Bruno loved the genuine, wholesome quality, but her free hand out of hold was flailing. Craig thought it was a dance of two halves - the first was more of an American Smooth and the second a Viennese - it was cheating a bit. Kevin looks LIVID. Darcey thought it had charm and an understated quality, and Shirley agrees - it was exquisite and fantastic. This is pure prom night romance \u2013 lovely flow and beautiful storytelling from Stacey and Kevin. The sweetness is making my teeth hurt, but this is a beautiful Viennese despite a rogue arm from Stacey. GAWJUS. Time for round two! First up it\u2019s STACEY AND KEVIN! Their second dance is the Viennese Waltz to \u2018You\u2019re My World\u2019 by Cilla Black. This is a lovely song for a Viennese, and a fitting tribute to what has been a lovely Strictly partnership. I have a sneaky feeling Joe is going to pip Stace to the post next week, but this has been one of my favourite couples to watch this year, and they\u2019d be worthy Strictly winners. This interminable VT has given me time to run to the loo \u2013 THANKS STRICTLY. Scores: 9,9,9,10 (DRINK) - a total of 37 for Faye and Giovanni. Oh Bruno, really? Shirley thought it had lovely steps, but it needed more flow in places. Bruno thought it had lots of quality content, but Craig wanted more hip action on the first set of voltas - the routine was incredible, however. Darcey thought it was a masterclass in technique in a really difficult routine - she loved it. Faye\u2019s dress is really quite horrific in every way \u2013 Becks just described it as \u201ca highlighter multipack\u201d. Nice footwork from Faye, but a bit stiff in the hip action and this feels a bit heavy in places. I think this could have done with a couple of extra days\u2019 rehearsal \u2013 behold the curse of the semi final. And finally for this round, it\u2019s FAYE AND GIOVANNI! Their first dance is the Samba to \u2018I Go To Rio\u2019 by Pablo Cruise. I need to see these two back in the land of normal again after last week\u2019s puppet horror, is still giving me nightmares. Two dances, double the work. DRINK. Scores: 7,8,8,8 - a total of 31 for Lauren and AJ. Darcey thought it started well, and Lauren\u2019s nerves added to the performance (SURE). Lauren wanted more clipped head positioning and for Lauren to maintain it to the very end. Shirley liked the character, but it got out of sync at the end. Bruno thought it was a grown up an mature performance (DRINK), but it was difficult to sustain. Craig thought it was a bit pedestrian in places, and a bit stiff and flat-footed in places. I love how much confident Lauren has become, but this feels a bit stompy and laboured to me, with not nearly enough attack for a Tango. The music really doesn\u2019t help, sadly. Next up it\u2019s LAUREN AND AJ! Their first dance is the Tango to \u2018Nutbush City Limits\u2019 by Tina Turner. This requires some heavy-duty attack and attitude from Lauren, who has used up all the wafty ballroom options and is left with the dances that are less in her comfort zone. I\u2019m a bit worried for her. Scores: 9,9,9,9 - a total of 36 for Ashley and Pasha. Craig loved the ferocity and passion, although Ashley lost her balance at the end. Darcey loved the dramatic intent, but it felt a bit busy and frantic in places. Shirley wanted more passion and drama, but Ashley did a good job. Bruno though it was fierce and fearless, and Ashley\u2019s power was irresistible. Love Ashley\u2019s BDSM Paso frock, less keen on Pasha\u2019s Star Trek jumpsuit. Good caping, mind. This is 50 shades of fierce, with bags of attitude from Ashley. As usual this pudding is so over-egged it\u2019s practically an omelette, but I\u2019m enjoying it nonetheless. It\u2019s time for ASHLEY AND PASHA! Their first dance is the Paso Doble to \u2018Spectrum (Say My Name)\u2018 by Florence + The Machine. They were in the dance off for the second time last week, they\u2019re going to need top marks from the Judges to stay out of the bottom two this week. Crying! DRINK! Scores: 6,8,7,8 - a total of 29 for Joe and Dianne. Bruno thought it was caring and romantic, but it had too much rise and fall. Craig agrees - the movement was too exaggerated and it made it look a bit rigid. Darcey loved Joe\u2019s posture, but he had difficulty with the continuous rotation. Shirley liked the footwork and the reverse turns, but it needed more glide - not Joe\u2019s best dance, but a good effort. Goodness, so much fog. Hard to see Joe\u2019s feet, but perhaps that\u2019s a good thing. He\u2019s doing a very nice job of this Viennese, but it could do with a bit more glide and less rise and fall, I think. Lovely though, perfect Strictly showmance fodder. Next up it\u2019s JOE AND DIANNE! Their first dance this evening is the Viennese Waltz to \u2018This Year\u2019s Love\u2019 by David Gray. Love a Viennese, and Joe needs to smash this to guarantee his place in the Final. He\u2019s a local boy and I\u2019ve invited him round for tea and cake next week when he comes down to do the pre-final trip back to the shire, so would be nice if you could all not kick him out please. Reading the Terms &amp; Conditions this week: Huw Edwards. Sure, why not. Move it along, Huw - it\u2019s a long night and we\u2019ve all got places to be. Scores: 9.10,10,10 (DRINK) - a total of 39 for Stacey and Kevin. The judges have gone early. Shirley thought it was a superb way to open the show, with full on energy - absolutely phenomenal. Bruno thought it had plenty of welly, it was 100% authentic 1920s flapper-style Charleston. Craig thought Stacey\u2019s left foot didn\u2019t swivel properly, but it was quirky and eccentric and he loved it. Darcey thought it was fun and crazy, with the perfect amount of fooling about. She loved the donkey, also known as the pony. The drink has kicked in early. Stacey and Kev are old people, until they cast off the knitting to live their best Charleston life. This is all kinds of fabulous, helped enormously by the brilliant music. Stacey is made for this kind of madness, and is giving it everything she\u2019s got. Great swivel, lovely character, LOVED that. Great start. First up it\u2019s STACEY AND KEVIN! Their first dance this evening is a Charleston to \u2018Five Foot Two Eyes Of Blue\u2019 by Spike Jones. They have very sensibly picked proper Charleston music, which it feels like we haven\u2019t seen in a while. I am here for this. It\u2019s good luck message week, featuring lots of cute kids and random members of the public who are Team Stacey. Out come the judges! Shirley\u2019s come as a mermaid, and I rather like it. Less keen on Darcey\u2019s Saturday Night Fever getup. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a blue Grecian tablecloth, Claudia as a walking pasta maker. YUMMY. And we\u2019re off! Last week on Strictly: MUSICALS WEEK! It was all rather fabulous and we had a lovely time. Pashley ended up in the dance off for the second time, and saw off Charles and Karen. Only five couples remain, and it\u2019s the final push for the final. They\u2019re working so hard! DRINK! But only in slow motion. Becks has just observed that Barry Cryer looks like the old man from Up, and now I need her to leave because she\u2019s clearly funnier than me. Domestic status: I have my friend Becks staying this weekend, so may chip in with her thoughts on the dancing, or just steal her jokes without asking. Mostly her job is to keep my wine topped up and not get annoyed by my incessant tapping and talking to myself. This week\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo \u2013 a swing of something you were technically saving for Christmas for any occurrence of the following: Tess saying \u201clook at his little face\u201d to a functioning adult Any mention of how hard they\u2019ve worked this week Any dance being difficult for a man A ten from Bruno Crying Evening all, and welcome to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing liveblog! It\u2019s suddenly the semi-finals, despite the first half of this series dragging longer than Darcey and Shirley\u2019s earring collection. This time next week we\u2019ll be gearing up for the Grand Final, which is both sad and the sweet, sweet smell of weekend freedom. Tonight\u2019s show will answer a few burning questions \u2013 firstly, can Lauren do enough to take on the Joe Sugg fandom and steal a place in the final? And do any of our dancers have what it takes to deliver quality in TWO DANCES? Strictly history suggests not \u2013 usually the Semi is an under-rehearsed hot mess. It\u2019s also usually the pinnacle of over-scoring, but I\u2019m not sure the judges have anywhere left to go unless Bruno has a secret 11 paddle. I\u2019ll be here from 6.35pm to keep an eye on proceedings up here, and would be delighted if you could sprinkle a little magic and sparkle in the comment box below. It\u2019s the final push, so unleash your glitter reserves. See you shortly!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
