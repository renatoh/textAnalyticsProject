Erdo\u011fan made the announcement during a speech in Ankara on Wednesday but did not provide any further details. \u201cThe United States said Baghdadi killed himself in a tunnel,\u201d Erdogan said, criticising the US for a \u201ccommunications campaign\u201d over the jihadist\u2019s death. \u201cBut, I am announcing it here for the first time: we captured his wife and didn\u2019t make a fuss like them. Similarly, we also captured his sister and brother-in-law in Syria.\u201d It is not clear when or how the unidentified woman was arrested by Turkish forces, but Ankara said earlier this week it had captured several of the jihadist\u2019s relatives, including his elder sister Rasmiya Awad, in the northern Syrian town of Azaz, in Aleppo province. The Isis leader blew himself and three children up in a tunnel after US special forces entered his heavily-fortified compound in Syria\u2019s Idlib province during a raid on 26 October. According to Baghdadi\u2019s brother-in-law Muhammad Ali Sajid, who is in Iraqi custody, he had four wives when he last met him in the summer of 2018 \u2013 the maximum allowed under Islamic law. It is not clear if any of his wives were present during the US attack. One of the women is an Iraqi known as Nour, the daughter of one of his aides. At one point, Baghdadi was also believed to be married to a German teenager, but she was reported to have fled his house in 2016. Ex-wife Saja al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi national, also left him in 2009 while pregnant. She was arrested in Lebanon in 2014 and freed a year later in an al-Qaida prisoner swap. Awad was reportedly arrested in a trailer on Monday in a part of north-west Syria under Turkish control, along with her husband, daughter-in-law and five children. Turkish officials claim she possesses valuable intelligence regarding Isis operations. It was not immediately clear if her capture produced intelligence that led to the capture of the unidentified wife. The US raid on Baghdadi\u2019s compound was a major blow to the extremist group, which lost control of its last slivers of territory in Syria in March this year. Isis has since announced Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi as Baghdadi\u2019s successor, but little is known about him. Intelligence officials believe the name is a nom de guerre"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
