The home secretary, Sajid Javid, a Muslim, has previously called for such action to be taken and asked each of his four rivals to back him during Tuesday night\u2019s hour-long BBC TV debate. Each appeared to nod and express agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s great that we all agree on that,\u201d Javid said and stressed there was a \u201cconcern [about] growing anti-Muslim hatred in our country, certainly over the last few years, in all parts of society. And, wherever that is, including in political parties, it must be absolutely rooted out.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are, today, one of the most successful multiracial democracies in the world \u2013 whatever your race, whatever your religious background. And that is what we have got to remain.\u201d The issue was raised by Abdullah Patel, an imam from Bristol, who said he had seen first hand the effects of Islamophobia and asked the candidates whether they agreed that \u201cwords have consequences\u201d. The host, Emily Maitlis, referred the question first to Boris Johnson, reminding him of comments he had made comparing Muslim women wearing the veil with letterboxes and bank robbers, as well as his handling of the Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case during his time in the Foreign Office. \u201cIn so far as my words have given offence over the last 20 or 30 years, when I have been a journalist and people have taken those words out of my articles and escalated them, of course I am sorry for the offence they have caused,\u201d Johnson replied. \u201cWhen my Muslim great-grandfather came to this country in fear of his life in 1912, he did so because he knew it was a place that was a beacon of hope and of generosity and openness, and a willingness to welcome people from around the world.\u201d After the debate, Patel said he had been unimpressed with the majority of the responses. Johnson also denied that his erroneous suggestion that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been involved in training journalists had contributed to an increase in her sentence in an Iranian jail. A spokesman for Javid\u2019s campaign said: \u201cSajid is deeply concerned about rising division in our society. We are a great country, the world\u2019s most successful multiracial democracy, and there are people from all backgrounds and races in the most senior roles right across society. \u201cBut there is a rise in hate crime across the country and we cannot close our eyes to it. \u201cThough he does not have any reason to believe there is anything endemic in the Tory party that breeds Islamophobia, no organisation is immune from this cancer. \u201cSo he\u2019s pleased to open up the party to scrutiny \u2013 we must have the courage that the Labour party has so sorely lacked.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
