Yet as Mr Tony's big day dawns, we hear the chancellor was in the highest of spirits at last week's Vatican conference on global poverty. Turning to one reporter, Gordon asked with a huge guffaw if he would be staying on in Rome to interview Italy's new finance minister (Silvio Berlusconi has been filling the role since the previous incumbent found his desk in the lift on July 3). Lest anyone had missed the point, he later revisited the subject. \"Of course,\" he twinkled, \"Silvio Berlusconi is now finance minister AND prime minister.\" Again the guffaw. Most confusing, we tell the Giles in the Treasury press office. Either he's finally lost it or he's making another of his fantastically subtle plays - which do you think it might be? \"I couldn't comment any further as I didn't hear the context,\" he says. \"But it would have been joshy and informal.\" Doubtless. \u00b7 Surveillance 1: Alastair Campbell, at 7pm on Monday, loitering with a briefcase in the shadows of St Paul's cathedral. We guess he was waiting for someone before Bill Clinton's Guildhall book launch - but if you purchased a remarkably cheap luxury watch in the area, it may be wise to have it authenticated. \u00b7 And so to our promised interview with Noel Edmonds, formerly of television, now newly raised to the post of Deputy Lieutenant of Devon. \"Ah, the Guardian,\" he sighs when we call. \"My favourite paper.\" Then you know what we're going to ask: does the position offer some sort of bag-carrying role for Blobby? \"You are such an evil woman.\" Come come, Nolly. You're the one who's left him on the ruddy scrapheap. \"Oh God,\" he wails. \"I thought that taking this office would finally let me lay my past to rest.\" Mm. Good luck with that. \"Aren't I ever going to be allowed to forget, to say sorry? Actually, you've given me a fantastic idea - we should mount a show trial - like Saddam.\" On the telly, you mean? More later. \u00b7 Surveillance 2: Richard &amp; Judy's Richard Madeley, during the couple's C4 interview with Bill Clinton on Monday, comparing the time he was falsely accused of shoplifting alcohol from the local Tesco to the time the former US president was threatened with impeachment over the Monica Lewinsky affair. Way to find common ground, Richard! \u00b7 Carlisle's News and Star brings word of a near miss in the war on terror. It is too ghastly to contemplate what might have been had al-Qaida operatives been browsing the Keswick Oxfam last week - suffice it to say the detailed Ordnance Survey maps of the areas round two local military bases are no longer on display. Our thanks - and those of the occupants of Warcop and Catterick camps - are due to a beady-eyed shopper, whose call to the local constabulary prompted police to launch a daring raid through the macrame potwarmers and Kathy Lette novels. \u00b7 Resuming conversation with Noel Edmonds, we wonder if he is disappointed that his deputy lieutenancy no longer confers the right to raise a local army. \"I already have my own army,\" he laughs, \"They're bearded and wear tank tops - we're quite a sight when we come over the hill.\" Does the post require ceremonial dress? \"No, but I'll be parading round my house in uniform and with my sword erect.\" OK ... \"Oh God,\" sighs Noel. \"They'll probably rescind it now. Am I even allowed to say I think it's an honour?\" Well, we might stick it in the bottom of the copy. \"People like you,\" giggles Nolly, \"deserve a smack, and I might come and give you one. Either that or a big sticky kiss.\" Alas, the Diary office goes into a tunnel at this point, so the line's dead before we can arrange a delivery time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
