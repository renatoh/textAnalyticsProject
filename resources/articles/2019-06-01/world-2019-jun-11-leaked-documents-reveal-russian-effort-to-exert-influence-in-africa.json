The mission to increase Russian influence on the continent is being led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman based in St Petersburg who is a close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. One aim is to \u201cstrong-arm\u201d the US and the former colonial powers the UK and France out of the region. Another is to see off \u201cpro-western\u201d uprisings, the documents say. In 2018 the US special counsel Robert Mueller indicted Prigozhin, who is known as \u201cPutin\u2019s chef\u201d because of his Kremlin catering contracts. According to Mueller, his troll factory ran an extensive social media campaign in 2016 to help elect Donald Trump. The Wagner group \u2013 a private military contractor linked to Prigozhin \u2013 has supplied mercenaries to fight in Ukraine and Syria. The documents show the scale of Prigozhin-linked recent operations in Africa, and Moscow\u2019s ambition to turn the region into a strategic hub. Multiple firms linked to the oligarch, including Wagner, are known by employees as the \u201cCompany\u201d. Its activities are coordinated with senior officials inside Russia\u2019s foreign and defence ministries, the documents suggest. Putin showed little interest in Africa in the 2000s. But western sanctions imposed in 2014 over the annexation of Crimea have driven Moscow to seek new geopolitical friends and business opportunities. Russia has a military presence and peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic. CAR is described as \u201cstrategically important\u201d and a \u201cbuffer zone between the Muslim north and Christian south\u201d. It allows Moscow to expand \u201cacross the continent\u201d, and Russian companies to strike lucrative mineral deals, the documents say. On 24 May the Kremlin announced it was dispatching a team of army specialists to the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo. According to Dmitry Peskov, Putin\u2019s press spokesman, they will service Russian-made military equipment. So far Moscow has signed military cooperation deals with about 20 African states. Five days later the Kremlin said it would host the first ever Russia-Africa summit in October in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. Putin and Egypt\u2019s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, will chair the event. About 50 African leaders are due to attend. The aim is to foster political, economic and cultural cooperation. The leaked documents were obtained by the Dossier Center, an investigative unit based in London. The centre is funded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the Russian businessman and exiled Kremlin critic. Prigozhin has been approached for comment. He has previously denied any links to the troll factory and has said of Wagner that it does not exist. Putin has previously said that entities linked to Prigozhin do not constitute the Russian state. A map from December 2018 seen by the Guardian shows the level of cooperation between the \u201cCompany\u201d and African governments, country by country. Symbols indicate military, political and economic ties, police training, media and humanitarian projects, and \u201crivalry with France\u201d. Five is the highest level; one is the lowest. The closest relations are with CAR, Sudan and Madagascar \u2013 all put at five. Libya, Zimbabwe and South Africa are listed as four, according to the map, with South Sudan at three, and DRC, Chad and Zambia at two. Other documents cite Uganda, Equatorial Guinea and Mali as \u201ccountries where we plan to work\u201d. Libya and Ethiopia are flagged as nations \u201cwhere cooperation is possible\u201d. The Kremlin has recently stepped up its ground operation in Libya. Last November the Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar travelled to Moscow and met the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. Prigozhin was spotted at the talks. Egypt is described as \u201ctraditionally supportive\u201d. The graphic gives an overview of \u201cCompany\u201d activities and achievements. It claims credit in CAR for getting of rid of politicians who are \u201corientated to France\u201d, including national assembly representatives and the foreign minister. This appears to be Charles-Armel Doubane, sacked in December. It has \u201cstrengthened\u201d the army and set up newspapers and a radio station. Russia is an \u201c83% friend\u201d, it says. In Madagascar the new president, Andry Rajoelina, won election with \u201cthe Company\u2019s support\u201d, the map says. Russia \u201cproduced and distributed the island\u2019s biggest newspaper, with 2 million copies a month\u201d, it adds. Rajoelina denies receiving assistance. Another key territory is Sudan. Last year Russian specialists drew up a programme of political and economic reform, designed to keep President Omar al-Bashir in power. It included a plan to smear anti-government protesters, apparently copy-pasted from tactics used at home against the anti-Putin opposition. (One memo mistakenly says \u201cRussia\u201d instead of \u201cSudan\u201d.) One ploy was to use fake news and videos to portray demonstrators in Khartoum and other Sudanese cities as \u201canti-Islam\u201d, \u201cpro-Israel\u201d and \u201cpro-LGBT\u201d. The government was told to increase the price of newsprint \u2013 to make it harder for critics to get their message out \u2013 and to discover \u201cforeigners\u201d at anti-government rallies. In a leaked letter Prigozhin wrote to Bashir complaining that the president had not actually followed through on the advice. Prigozhin mentioned \u201clack of activity\u201d by the Sudanese government and its \u201cextremely cautious position\u201d. The military deposed Bashir in April in a coup. Last week Sudan\u2019s Rapid Support Forces opened fire on pro-democracy protesters, killing over a hundred. The Russian advisers had urged Sudan\u2019s military council to suppress the activists with \u201cminimal but acceptable loss of life\u201d, one former regime source told CNN. Meanwhile, Moscow is keen to exploit a long-running territorial dispute in Comoros, the documents say. France directly controls one out of four of the Indian Ocean islands, Mayotte. In 2018 Prigozhin employees flew to Comoros via Belarus. Their objective was to test if \u201cpolitical technologies\u201d might be used to inflame the row between Paris and the Comoros government. Other suggestions in the documents include trans-African road and rail-building schemes. A railway could be built linking Dakar in Senegal with Port Sudan in Sudan, along the \u201cold hajj [pilgrimage] route\u201d. A separate 2,300-mile (3,700km) toll road was proposed connecting Port Sudan with Douala in Cameroon. Neither has so far happened. A plan to revive \u201cpan-African consciousness\u201d appears closely modelled on the idea of Russkiy Mir, or Russian world. The concept has become fashionable under Putin and signifies Russian power and culture extended beyond current borders. One working paper is titled \u201cAfrican world\u201d. It calls for a developing \u201cAfrican self-identity\u201d. It recommends collecting a database of Africans living in the US and Europe, which might be used to groom \u201cfuture leaders\u201d and \u201cagents of influence\u201d. The eventual goal is a \u201cloyal chain of representatives across African territory\u201d, the March 2018 paper says. More immediate practical measures include setting up Russian-controlled non-governmental organisations in African states and organising local meetings. It is unclear how many Prigozhin initiatives have actually gone forward. There is evidence that media projects mentioned in the documents are now up and running \u2013 albeit with marginal impact. They include a website, Africa Daily Voice, with its HQ in Morocco, and a French-language news service, Afrique Panorama, based in Madagascar\u2019s capital Antananarivo. Russian operatives also offer thoughts on global politics. One policy paper, titled \u201cRussian influence in Africa\u201d, says Moscow needs to find \u201creliable partners among African states\u201d and should establish military bases."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
