Enzo Franchini Oliveros is accused over the death of Orlando Jos\u00e9 Figuera, 21, who was beaten, stabbed, doused in petrol and set on fire during street clashes on 20 May 2017. Franchini was arrested on Monday in a town near Madrid, according to a Spanish national police spokesperson. Venezuela\u2019s top prosecutor, Tarek William Saab, made the arrest public on Wednesday, accusing Franchini of crimes including \u201cattempted murder and terrorism\u201d. Protests against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro rocked Venezuela for several months in 2017, prompting a brutal response from security forces. More than 130 people died in the unrest and thousands were injured \u2013 most of them anti-government protesters caught in the crackdown. Venezuela\u2019s government has insisted Figuera was the victim of a political hate crime, who was targeted for supporting the government. But the country\u2019s top chief prosecutor at the time of the incident, Luisa Ortega D\u00edaz, concluded that Figuera was stabbed after an altercation over a job application. Figuera\u2019s assailant then accused him of being a thief; he was beaten, doused with petrol and set alight. Ortega now lives in exile, having broken with Maduro\u2019s government in August that year. The conditions that led to the 2017 protests continue today, as Maduro fends off challenges to his power from opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, who is recognised as the legitimate leader by the US and most of the world\u2019s democracies. The United Nations\u2019 refugee agency estimates that 4 million Venezuelans have left the country to escape food shortages, insecurity and economic collapse. Last week, the UN\u2019s human rights chief accused Maduro\u2019s security forces of committing a series of \u201cgross violations\u201d against Venezuelan dissenters, including more than 5,000 extrajudicial executions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
