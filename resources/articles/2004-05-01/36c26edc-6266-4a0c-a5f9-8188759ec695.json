This not only includes the \u00a31.2m received for Jon Stead from Blackburn in February but the emergence of eight academy graduates who regularly play first-team football, the brightest of these being David Mirfin, a 19-year-old centre-back, who shines in Jackson's 3-5-2 formation. \"Jon Stead won't be the last boy from our academy to play at the highest level,\" said Jackson. \"I'm confident David Mirfin will also become a Premiership player. Like Steady, I know he'll make the transition; I never believed those people who kept saying it would be too big a jump for Jon.\" Jackson feared the more difficult adjustment would be Huddersfield's adaptation to life without their leading scorer. \"I wondered how we'd do without Steady, especially as the average age of my team is only around 21,\" he admitted. \"But we've coped surprisingly well and I must give special praise to the older players like Efe Sodje and Andy Booth.\" Sodje, a Nigerian international who played against England in the last World Cup, arrived from Crewe and, sporting his trademark blue and white bandana, is now Jackson's captain. \"Efe's been magnificent in defence,\" he said. \"And he's also helped the club shop. They've sold over 2,000 Sodje bandanas this year.\" Booth scored his 100th goal for Huddersfield last week. This is the centre-forward's second spell in his home town after an interlude at Sheffield Wednesday also featuring a disillusioning loan stint with Tottenham. \"You only have to talk to Andy for two minutes to realise he's rediscovered the love for football he'd lost,\" enthused Jackson. Booth's is an unusually unselfish devotion. \"I would gladly give away all my goals if we could be automatically promoted now,\" he insisted. \"In August, we would have been delighted to reach the play-offs but just missing out on automatic promotion almost felt worse than being relegated.\" How ironic that, back in 1999, Jackson was not deemed \"a big enough name\" by the former chairman, Barry Ruberry, who decided Steve Bruce would sweep Huddersfield into the Premiership. The current Birmingham manager very nearly achieved that aim but Ruberry soon realised his financial projections had gone radically awry and duly sold Marcus Stewart, Bruce's top striker, to Ipswich. Thereafter, everything unravelled - fast. As debts soared, first Bruce departed, followed by Lou Macari and Mick Wadsworth, with the latter presiding over a demoralised squad who often went unpaid for weeks on end. By last spring the administrators were in and creditors writing off debts of around \u00a320m. Out went the consortium which had replaced Ruberry and in stepped a new backer, Ken Davy. The owner of the local rugby league club and a man with a financial services background, Davy immediately identified a highly popular former manager as the catalyst for salvation. \"The difference now is that the players' desire is back and the fans can see it,\" explained Jackson, whose team are now drawing crowds of close to 20,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
