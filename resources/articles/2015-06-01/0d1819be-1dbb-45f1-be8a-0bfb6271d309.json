Now 31, she is in good health, after receiving help from an early intervention in psychosis team, and works as a scientist in the NHS. She lives in York. \u201cIn 2012 I was really unwell \u2013 I was having a bad psychotic episode \u2013 and ended up in A&amp;E. I told the mental health team there that I couldn\u2019t keep myself safe and asked them to admit me. I was hearing voices telling me to set myself on fire in order to save the world. \u201cIt was terrifying. I really believed that tens of thousands of people would die unless I did what the voices said. \u201cThe staff were helpful enough. But they said there was no mental health bed available anywhere in the whole north-east, so they sent me home. They said they would send the crisis team to see me, but not on which day or at what time. I was in crisis there and then. In fact the crisis team didn\u2019t arrive for three days, by which time I had already been sectioned. \u201cWhen I got home I found a can of petrol in the garage and was standing there with it and some matches. I tried to get the lid off but couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s really lucky, because I planned to set myself on fire. If the lid had been less rusty I\u2019d have done that. That\u2019s how close I came to killing myself. \u201cIt was a really frightening experience because I was so close to being dead. I was clearly very unwell and needed to be in hospital, but there were no beds. \u201cNHS care for people having a mental health crisis is really patchy. I\u2019m lucky because I didn\u2019t manage to kill myself and did end up in hospital and did eventually get help from an early intervention in psychosis team. \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t be about luck. It should be about everybody in that situation getting the help and care they need every time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
