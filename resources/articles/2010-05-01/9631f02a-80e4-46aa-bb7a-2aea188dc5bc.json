After weeks of wrangling, the Democratic majority got enough support to overcome a threatened Republican filibuster for a bill intended to end the spectre of \"too big to fail\" banks, by creating an orderly process of liquidation for failing financial institutions. The vote took place on the day of the biggest percentage fall in Wall Street stocks since March 2009. The Dow Jones Industrial Average crumbled by 376 points, or 3.6%, to 10,068, as Greece's difficulties and broader turmoil in the Eurozone sent shockwaves over the Atlantic, casting doubt on the hoped-for global recovery. Measures in the US package will create a consumer protection agency intended to guard against predatory business tactics. There will be greater transparency in the closed world of derivatives trading, and shareholders will get a British-style \"say on pay\" vote on boardroom bonuses. At the White House, Barack Obama characterised the vote as a victory over Wall Street blocking tactics: \"Over the past year, the financial industry has repeatedly tried to end this reform with hoards of lobbyists and millions of dollars of ads. When they couldn't kill it, they tried to water it down.\" The president said the law would mean an end to state-funded rescues: \"Taxpayers will never again be asked to foot the bill for Wall Street's mistakes. There will be no more taxpayer-funded bailouts. Period.\" The bill cleared the procedural hurdle at the second attempt, having a day earlier failed to gain the 60 votes needed. Three Republicans joined Democrats in supporting the measure, including newly elected Massachusetts senator Scott Brown, who occupies the seat formerly held by Ted Kennedy. But two Democrats voted against, complaining that the bill would be ineffectual and would not go far enough. Having achieved the \"cloture\" vote to curtail debate, the bill now only needs a simply majority to go forward. But there are still issues to be resolved, including the precise shape of the \"Volcker rule\" blocking banks from engaging in riskier activities such as operating hedge funds and trading with their own capital. Named after the former Federal Reserve boss Paul Volcker, this element is the subject of an amendment yet to be voted upon, as is a tougher proposal forcing banks to spin off desks trading in credit swaps. The outcome was a relief to the Democrats, who viewed Wall Street oversight as their top legislative priority following the passage of healthcare reform in March. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said it was \"great progress\". But John Ensign, a Republican senator, objected that the measures would lead to greater government intervention in the free market, creating \"unintended consequences that may ultimately bring more damage down on the American people\". The political action happened on a dismal day for Wall Street as shares officially entered \"correction\" territory, down 10% from their recent high point in late April. All 30 components of the Dow ended lower. If the fall extends to 20%, it will meet the generally accepted definition of a bear market."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
