I don\u2019t think we should just fall back on Marx\u2019s \u201chaven in a heartless world\u201d truism to understand why. Given, for example, the Catholic church\u2019s doctrines of original sin and personal sin, it provides little in the way of haven in this world, and posits, at best , a post-mortem \u201cjudgment of God\u201d as salvation. What the far right makes use of is simply the role of hierarchy within the religions with which it allies, such as to normalise the anti-democratic hierarchy it also seeks to establish. The \u201cChristian civilisation\u201d the likes of Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Steve Bannon refer to is one conceived of as pre-democratic, so that a false history and a liturgy of supplication combine as ideological props for the legitimisation of the world view of the right. Fascist and rightwing populists have always formed convenient alliances with hierarchical religions. One solution available to the left in the face of rightwing populism\u2019s critique of the failings of capitalist democracy is to argue precisely that capitalism is not democratic enough, and push for the extension of working-class democracy and extra-parliamentary institutions. We cannot combat the new anti-democratic forces by cleaving to the status quo. Nick Moss London \u2022 Steinmetz-Jenkins and J\u00e4ger have helpfully drawn attention to the link between rightwing populism and religion. This link is as much with conservative Catholics as with conservative evangelicals (as in the case of many Trump supporters). Indeed it applies to conservatives of all religions. Broad church and liberal Christians sometimes struggle to get their views heard in the midst of the loud clamour of the conservative right. But readers may be pleased to know that Modern Church (of which I am a trustee), which started out in 1898 as an Anglican society determined to promote a rational approach to theology and which welcomed Darwinism, is working on this very issue. In fact our annual conference in July is dedicated to this subject. Rosalind Lund Cambridge \u2022 Not only do far-right European populists seek an \u201cunholy alliance with religion\u201d. Angela Merkel, of the Christian Democratic party and daughter of a Lutheran pastor, has recently used religious language to attack President Trump. Her first point, in a speech to the alumni of Harvard, was to encourage \u201ca change of mind\u201d. The Greek is \u201cmetanoia\u201d; the Christian word is \u201crepentance\u201d. And \u201cA change of mind\u201d was the first of Luther\u2019s theses he nailed to the door 500 years ago. Religion resonates. It has as Steinmetz-Jenkins and J\u00e4ger suggest the \u201ccapacity to recraft norms\u201d. A pity it is now too late for another minister\u2019s daughter, lacking such a clearly stated \u201cmoral centre\u201d as Mrs Merkel, to stand up against our English nativists. She just caved in.
