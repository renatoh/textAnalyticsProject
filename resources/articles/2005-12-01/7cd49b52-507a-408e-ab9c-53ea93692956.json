And because Morocco is practically on the doorstep - or at least on the doorstep of anyone with an aeroplane at their disposal - I can be there in the time it takes her to start wondering why I'm taking so long at the newsagent's. Imagine her surprise when I get back on Monday night loaded with enough bags of dates to solve all our gift-buying and yuletide bowel problems at a stroke! Off I go, then, with my friend Neil, whom I have decided to put in charge of haggling while I deal with the language barrier. Neil is sceptical. 'OK, what does that say?' he demands, pointing to an Arabic squiggle as we shuffle through the malodorous immigration hall. 'Marrakesh welcomes heavy smokers,' I confidently announce. It is well after 10pm by the time our car reaches the pockmarked walls of the old city and a porter appears out of the gloom to guide us into the spooky recesses of the medina. God knows how we'll get out again. We are promised that our accommodation, Kssour Agafay, is a bijou members' club housed in a 15th-century riad, painstakingly restored to authentic wonder at a cost of untold billions of dirhams. You wouldn't guess from the exterior (which consists of a door in the wall) but, once inside, all is elegance and serenity as advertised. We are greeted with glasses of mint tea and ushered to our rooms, which are done out in tooled woods and ornate tiles and sumptuous ruggery and leathers hand-stitched by the descendants of elvish shoemakers enslaved to the courts of medieval sultans. And look at this blue bath! The rest of the riad is equally fabulous with cascading waters, marble pillars and mosaics, deep sofas and luxuriously appointed niches in which to be seen leafing through the latest Houellebecq (indeed I happen to have one in my Argos weekender luggage). The place was cooed over in Wallpaper* magazine's prestigious design awards. Oh yes, it's all very 'now', though if we could return for a moment to the actual now, maybe we could pop out for a drink before everything shuts? No problem. A helpful girl from the riad leads us down a selection of forbidding alleys full of rootling cats and people living in sacks, and out as far as the main square, where we soon attract a trail of chattering street urchins tugging on Neil's sleeve. 'What are they saying?' he cries above the hubbub. 'They're asking if it's a Paul Smith,' I say. The evening is slightly disappointing. A cash machine swallows my card and we can't get a beer anywhere, not even with Neil's money. There's not much of a bar culture here. Putting our trust in the stars, we zig-zag our way back to the riad, where the manager (a gentle man in monkish garb) produces a couple of bottles of Budweiser from up his voluminous sleeve. Excellent. It must be five in the morning when the mosques open and we are summoned to prayer by someone with a voice like an air-raid siren. I fall asleep again until we are summoned for breakfast (a big basket of pastries, yoghurt, fruit, coffee) on the dappled terrace, with its panorama of jumbled rooftops, palm trees and the Atlas mountains far in the distant pink haze. This is the life. Birds twitter in the orange trees and trailing plants; in the street below, a donkey hee-haws a lament to poor working conditions. Venturing out, we are amazed to find the souk in full frenzy only yards from our front door, its tumble of stalls spilling over with spices and fine raiments, supplanting those lingering first impressions - dreamlike now - of the scene last night, which I seem to remember was dominated by a man urinating into a drain. Progress through the narrow passageways is quite perilous for anyone who has not taken the trouble to evolve extra eyes. In the medina strict laws oblige traffic (mostly moped riders with an infant balanced on the front) to keep to the right or the left and, where possible, to approach pedestrians suddenly from the rear. But we are still alive when we emerge at Djemaa el Fna, the big square, where Neil's camera is the ideal magnet for snake charmers wanting him to take photographs of me wearing an assortment of live cobras. The man is astonished to find that I'm not really a snake person. To his further dismay I must also turn down his offer of scorpions. We weave our way through the crowds and the drummers and shoe-shiners and dancers in tribal dress and the man selling false teeth, and plunge back into the souk on the far side. But what to buy? A belly-dancing outfit? A tortoise? My wife has been hankering after a giant hexagonal lantern for the hall but could I get one in my hand luggage? Hmm. Perhaps a dagger instead. But I have no sooner paused at the small armaments stall than the proprietor invites me forcibly into the back where he shows me a photograph of himself accompanying Robert Plant on an indigenous stringed instrument. I am so impressed I almost come out with a suit of armour. Neil, who is outside pondering the increased likelihood of getting run over by a mule, crosses over to buy a traditional fake Rolex for his dad. We walk on, sometimes in circles, looking at this and that. In the end we find jewellery and novelty slippers for our wives and handfuls of those leather wristbands for the kids. At one point we seem to have strayed from the tourist route. It's all getting a bit cobbly. People are sitting in doorways drinking tea and the little shops have stopped selling hand-beaten lamps and tie-dyed kaftans in favour of lumps of coal, and plastic buckets, piles of cauliflowers, socks and tripe and inner tubes. There is lots to see. I'm amazed at the number of cats, which seems inconsistent with the number of mopeds. Interestingly there are no dogs, which are, of course, slower on their feet. We move on, working up a sweat. Although this is a day that demands sunglasses and a blob of factor eight, the locals are wrapped up in layers of hooded overcoats and scarves. What do they think it is - the middle of December? It's lunchtime before we finally come upon a sign pointing to 'The Big Square', presumably erected by tradespeople weary of telling lost English holidaymakers how to get back to their hotels. After a quick couscous in the Big Square (I still can't quite get my mind round Djemaa el Fna), we get a cab out to our riad's sister hotel, the Kasbah Agafy, which is in the middle of nowhere, but has a view that simultaneously manages to offer olive groves, desert and snow-capped mountains. After the mint tea ceremony, they show us around the place, which used to be a fort in the olden days, long before its occupants expected five-star open-air spas, meditation caves, soft furnishings and a tribal drum in every room. I don't know why anyone would want to live in a tent but they have those too. Very stylish. But after a hard morning's plodding around the developing world, what a chap needs now is a beer by the pool. Can that be arranged? It can. We lie around in the sun for the rest of the afternoon planning a route for this evening that will take us through licensed premises. At dusk, we're back in the big square. The snakes have gone, but the drummers are out in force, and food stalls have sprung up, loaded with kebabs and sausages and sheep's heads. Cooks in white coats and hats move about under a blaze of electric lightbulbs ladling out stews and bread and beans to diners crammed at the tables. It smells so great that we immediately decide to go to a proper restaurant that has knives and forks and minimum standards of hygiene. There's a nice-looking one we saw last night with a doorman standing outside wearing a fez. We skirt the periphery in the drift of smoke from the fires, dodging the bloody mopeds and avoiding the beckonings of tattooists and barbers shaving heads in their dim alcoves. We pass covered wagons with their mountains of nuts, oranges and dried fruit. Is this a good time to buy dates? I ask Neil. He gives me a doubtful look. The answer, of course, is there is never a good time to buy dates. Factfile Phil Hogan travelled with CV Travel (0870 062 3415; www.cvtravel.co.uk).
