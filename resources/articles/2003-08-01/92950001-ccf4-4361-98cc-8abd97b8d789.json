Fat chance", "bodyText": "It has shoved Dr Atkins's diet books off the top of the New York Times bestseller list and is hyped as a 'delicious, doctor-designed, foolproof plan for fast and healthy weight loss'. The South Beach Diet sounds so good you want to eat it first and then go there. Its author, Dr Arthur Agatson of the Mount Sinai Medical Centre in Miami, followed Atkins's example by altering his own diet - shunning carbohydrates and increasing protein intake - then making his fortune by selling it to an increasingly thick-waisted and desperate public. In the face of new diets appearing almost daily (remember the Zone, Grapefruit, Eat Right For Your Blood Group and Cabbage Soup diets?) it is hard to know what to believe. Instead of old-fashioned calorie-counting, there is a maze of low carbohydrate, low fat, high fat and high protein diets to navigate. The National Centre of Eating Disorders estimates that in the past 10 years around two-thirds of women and a third of men will have gone on a diet, most to no avail. Over half of us are overweight, says the British Nutrition Foundation, and the figure is rising. Yet such is the concern about fads in dieting that the British Dietetic Association and the American Institute for Cancer Research are telling people that dieting could be as damaging to their health as being overweight. Last month Dr Bill Roberston, a biochemist at University College Medical School in London, warned that the Atkins diet, with its high protein intake and lack of fruit and vegetables, raised calcium levels in the urine and was a recipe for kidney stones. 'Faddy diets are increasing in popularity but are only temporary solutions,' says Amanda Wynne, a registered dietician and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. 'You lose weight on any restrictive diet. On a cabbage soup diet you cut down on your calories and lose weight, but it's not sustainable. When you go back to your old eating habits you put on weight again.' The other concern is that most faddy diets cut out whole food groups. Wynne says: 'The Atkins diet cuts out many fruit, vegetables and carbohydrates and these are important sources of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fibre. These elements of diet are associated with reductions in heart disease and cancer.' The rationale behind the Atkins and South Beach diets is that there's a metabolic advantage in manipulating the intake of fats and carbohydrates. 'They claim that if you eat lots of fat you burn up fat more easily,' says Wynne. 'But the bottom line is that the number of calories you eat determines how much weight you lose. There is no evidence that you will lose fat preferentially if you eat more fat.' Many people on these diets restrict their calories, at least initially, to 1,000 calories or fewer a day. This rapidly burns stores of carbohydrates in the body, which then turns to using up fat to provide fuel. 'This isn't a desirable metabolic state,' warns Wynne. 'By severely restricting your calories you go into a condition called ketosis. You are starving yourself and you will feel weak, nauseous and have bad breath. If you talk to people on these diets you find they've eaten next to nothing during the day - one chicken drumstick and half an apple. Weight will drop off but they will put it on again.' Research in the New England Journal of Medicine in May supports this. A study saw 63 obese men and women randomly allocated to either an Atkins type diet (low carbohydrate, high protein and fat) or a low calorie, high carbohydrate, low fat (conventional) diet. At three months the Atkins group had lost an average 4 per cent more, but at a year this difference had gone. The overall weight loss was only 4 kg, and more than a third of people dropped out of the study. Dr Robert Bonow and Dr Robert Eckel, from Northwestern University in Denver, commenting on the study in the NEJM, warned that a diet high in saturated fat increases cholesterol levels and the risk of heart disease. Dr Jules Hirsch of the Rockefeller University in New York was not surprised. 'The impact this diet has had on obesity is virtually nil and this data shows there is no reason to follow this diet. There is immense public interest in restrictive carbohydrate diets but it is based on hearsay. There is a great paucity of scientific evidence.' There is no scientific evidence, agrees Wynne, that any manipulation of food makes us lose weight - unless we reduce calories. 'Food-combining diets say you shouldn't eat protein and carbohydrate together because the body can't digest both and so you store food as fat,' says Wynne. 'But people lose weight initially because it is so difficult to follow the dietary rules that they haven't got time to eat as many calories.' The American Institute for Cancer Research says that food-combining diets such as the New Beverly Hills Diet tout theories 'about the mechanics of digestion that are scientifically incorrect'. Barry Groves, a lecturer in Dietetics and Obesity and author of Eat Fat Get Thin (Vermillion \u00a34.99), believes that diets such as Atkins appeal to women because they cause initial rapid weight loss. 'The first two weeks they can only eat 20g of carbohydrate a day - around one-and-a-half slices of bread - so they lose weight quickly,' he says. 'But there is a survival advantage in storing fat - in the past those who survived had fat stored for the hard times, so our metabolism slows down if you lose fat too quickly and your weight loss levels out while you may still be overweight. It's called stalling. The body gets frightened, so you need to lose weight more slowly.' In the US, where up to 60 per cent of adults are obese or overweight, some nutritionists are calling for a rethink on restrictive dieting. 'For a typical person in the Western world it is easy to get caught up in eating too much, and for some people cutting back a bit is a good thing to do,' says Marsha Hudnall, nutrition director of the Green Mountain at Fox Run in Vermont, a woman's retreat for healthy living without dieting. 'But if you starve people, then you set them up for overeating afterwards. 'Researchers carried out a study of 36 young active conscientious objectors in World War Two, cutting their food intake in half for six months. The men became obsessive about food, listless and lost interest in life. When the study stopped, they started overeating. The effects were felt for many years after the study, so this small amount of extreme restriction set them up for a lifelong struggle with their weight.' At Green Mountain they suggest an intake of at least a quarter to a third protein and the same for carbohydrates, encouraging starchy grains and vegetables and some healthier fats. 'Fad diets lead people to think there is some magic to being healthy when it's really sort of hard work,' says Hudnall. 'A calorie is a calorie, however you dress it up scientifically.' Hudnall encourages women to eat when hungry and then stop, and to avoid eating chaotically. Wynne believes this is a good approach. 'A lot of people who overeat are eating for reasons other than hunger, like boredom or stress. The best way to lose weight is to have a low-fat diet, because it is lower in calories, and also to watch your portion size. But there is also good evidence that exercise maintains weight loss. Thirty minutes of moderate exercise a day is probably fine, but even throwing away your remote control so you get up and change channels is better than nothing.' And you should change channels if a celebrity comes on, championing their latest diet. 'Celebrities like to voice their opinions loudly, but they are not qualified to give nutritional advice,' says Wynne. 'They are blessed with beautiful genes. Following a fad diet won't metamorphose you into Jennifer Aniston.' The South Beach diet Sold out in many US bookshops, it tells you to stop eating bread, pasta, potatoes, ice cream and sugar but you can stuff yourself with bacon, cheese and steak. There's no booze allowed. It promises weight loss of up to 13lb in two weeks, but critics claim it's water, not fat. The Zone A dressed-up calorie-controlled diet embraced by Hollywood a few years ago. It says you must eat 40 per cent carbs, 30 per cent protein and 30 per cent fat to stay thin. Critics don't think the 1,100 calories a day is enough in the long term. The grapefruit diet Grapefruits contain fat-busting enzymes, so you are urged to eat a half before each meal to stay thin. Oh, and only 800 calories a day, and drink lots of caffeine. Madness - particularly as grapefruits don't have 'fat-busting enzymes' at all. The cabbage soup diet You eat watery cabbage soup and lose up to 15lb in two weeks because no one can get enough calories from cabbage soup. Prepare to faint after a couple of days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
