Initially, the Catholic church was \u2013 unlike the Protestant church, which introduced the German \"heil\" salute as early as 1934 and became a form of \"state church\" \u2013 \"public enemy\" to the Nazis with its ideas of Volksgemeinschaft and F\u00fchrerprinzip, the principles of racially pure people's unity and F\u00fchrer leadership. The SS prohibited its members from exercising their Catholic belief, which was originally regarded as something that contradicted an SS member's ethos (interestingly, it was Himmler who allowed SS men to convert to Islam from 1939 to make inroads with the Muslim world). The German Catholic church was among Hitler's staunchest critics, and priests faced prosecution. With the beginning of the war, this hostile stance towards the Catholic church changed: war sometimes requires \"tolerance\" when in the interest of the war effort (Stalin, for example, allowed the Russian peasant population to turn \u2013 once again \u2013 to religion after the June 1941 invasion to boost morale). In order to win the support of some 14 nations, the majority of them Catholic, in their fight against \"Bolshevism\", the Nazis successfully appealed to a sense of a common \"European\" identity founded on cultural heritage and religion: Operation Barbarossa was portrayed as a \"crusade\" against the \"unholy alliance\" of Bolshevism and Zionism. Pope Pius XII's role is still not thoroughly researched and the present negative assessment of his role may change after US and UK archives are fully opened. Dr Sascha-Dominik Bachmann Portsmouth Business School \u2022\u2008The reference in your editorial (A turbulent priest, 18 September) to \"pro-German de Valera\", and your correspondent Luke Sorba's assertion that Ireland was \"very pro-German\" during the second world war are unjustified. Although Eamon de Valera's condolence call to the German embassy following the death of Hitler has rightly been condemned, some agreements made privately between the then taoiseach and the British worked to the advantage of the allies. The Donegal air corridor allowed British planes to overfly Irish territory en route to the Atlantic, and while German aircrews who crashed in Ireland were interned for the war, their British counterparts were generally quietly released. Neither policy was made public until after the war. The suffering of Dublin, bombed by the Luftwaffe in 1941 with over 40 killed, should also be remembered. Guy Woodward Dublin \u2022 While the Vatican presents itself as a champion of moral values, the abuse scandal and the prejudicial doctrines towards women, homosexuality and birth control leave me marvelling at the hypocrisy. But then I can't but agree with the pope's analysis of where secularism has got us, which incidentally matches radical Islam's view of the decadence and immorality of the materialism of the west. Fifty odd years of unrestrained consumption and declining moral values have exposed to a large degree the failure of secularism to put in place an alternative morality. This failure I think can be directly linked to the resurgence of conservative religion as people become ever-increasing victims of unrestrained capitalism and the dominance of the markets. Moral leadership is essential to us all, and if no one else will step forward with the message then we should not be surprised when religion does. We are in desperate need of a secular morality that puts human beings ahead of the bottom line and that's where the \"aggressive\" secularists fail miserably, as they attack religion for all its obvious flaws but offer nothing in its place. Simon Clarke Lewes, East Sussex \u2022\u2008The pope refers to the current global financial crisis being brought about by a lack of \"a solid ethical foundation for economic activity\" (Report, 17 September). This crisis happened \"on the watch\" of \"deeply religious\" political leaders such as George W Bush, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown \u2013 not \"aggressive/extreme secularists\".
