Not far into proceedings there is an interruption: counsel for former Attorney General John Ashcroft in Washington can't hear what's going on. The familiar name jolts the observer into a vivid recognition of what is actually happening in this room: America is on trial for its actions after September 11, and, so far at least, not coming out of it particularly well. In the first known case of its kind, the US government has just settled a dispute with an Egyptian national called Ehab Elmaghraby for $300,000 (\u00a3165,000). Elmaghraby, along with hundreds of Middle-Eastern and south-Asian men, was arrested after 9/11 as part of the FBI's terrorist investigations. Because, in the vast majority of cases, the prisoners' only connection to terrorism was their nationality, the official reasons given were minor immigration or financial violations. Almost all were subjected to imprisonment without bail. A communication blackout meant that for weeks, in contravention of the American constitution and of international law, they had no adequate access to lawyers. They were held in harsh conditions for months. A class action suit, pending, alleges \"negligence, assault, battery, and the intentional affliction of emotional distress\". Some, including Elmaghraby, who, with a man called Javaid Iqbal, filed a separate suit making similar claims, were held in isolation. All were subsequently deported, some to countries known to use torture. And all were eventually cleared of any connection to terrorism. A week later, Elmaghraby meets me at the airport in Alexandria, buzzing with his sudden fame. He has been on Egyptian TV, he is recognised in the street. \"I put my name in the internet and there are 1,154 websites about me!\" He is never off the phone now, he says; people think he is rich. The tale Elmaghraby tells the next day, sitting in a cafe, is a story of the American dream knocked suddenly off course. The son of two teachers, he grew up in Alexandria and went to commercial college; by the time he was in his second year he had his own car and a business selling perfume and cosmetics. An uncle who lived in New York came to visit, saw that he was not saving any money and persuaded him to come to America. Elmaghraby arrived on October 13 1991. He spoke no English or Spanish but found work guarding the clothes outside a store belonging to a friend of his uncle's. He picked the languages up quickly, however, and soon met and married Pilar Valerio, originally from the Dominican Republic, who worked just around the corner. She was 35, with two children, he in his mid-20s. Within two years he had set himself up as a street trader during the week and on a fleamarket stall in Queens at weekends. Then, in 1996, he bought a restaurant in Manhattan. He was doing well; he advertised in Arabic newspapers and on Arabic TV and flew pop stars in from Egypt to entertain his clientele. On a good weekend he could clear $25,000 (\u00a313,500). He spent a lot, too: on trips to Las Vegas or Atlantic City, he thought nothing of losing $3,000 at blackjack or giving Pilar $1,000 to gamble on the machines. \"We were very happy,\" he says. \"We had fun, you know.\" On the morning of September 11 2001, he had bought food for the restaurant, he says, and was dropping the boxes off just inside the door when an elderly Asian woman said, \"Yeah, you Arab people did it.\" \"I didn't know what she was talking about,\" he says. The restaurant was closed for three days. The following Saturday at 3am, he says, two police officers walked in, beckoned him over and pointed to four men sitting at different tables, saying \"Get me him, and him and him.\" They arrested one. The second time, they arrested two. Once they arrested four. They did this, he says, every night for 10 days. He believes they also waylaid people approaching and leaving the restaurant. Word spread and people started staying away. On September 30, his doorbell rang at 5:30pm and he opened it to two men. \"One of them said, 'You have a gun?' He grabbed my cellular phone. Another one grabbed my key, and pushed me in my back and said, 'Go upstairs.' So I walked upstairs, and found four FBI in the living room.\" A female FBI officer sat with Pilar in the kitchen, he says, while seven others questioned him until 1.30am. \"They say, 'What's the story about September 11? Do you know anything about Osama bin Laden?' I say, 'Who is Osama bin Laden?'\" He would later discover that his landlady's husband, a Moroccan, had once applied for pilot training. Elmaghraby maintains that he and the Moroccan hardly spoke, let alone discussed pilot school, because they did not understand each other's accents. He was taken to the Metropolitan Detention Centre (MDC) in Brooklyn, where, he claims, the first thing that happened was that he found himself \"flying from the car to the wall. I felt something in my mouth. I find these two teeth are broken.\" His handcuffs were attached to a waist chain and ankle cuffs. He was dragged into reception, and made to kneel in a cell. He had had an operation on one of his knees, and after 25 minutes or so, he began to cry with pain and was allowed to stand until he was taken upstairs to a unit specially created for 9/11 detainees, and locked in a room not much bigger, he says, than the sofa we are sitting on. The court settlement, signed in February of this year by an attorney representing the US, by Elmaghraby's lawyers, and by Elmaghraby himself, stipulates that it \"is not, is no way intended to be, and should not be construed as, an admission of liability or fault on the part of the United States, its agents, servants, or employees\". But in 2003 an independent report by the office of the inspector general, Glenn A Fine, found that there were \"significant problems in the way the September 11 detainees were treated\" at the MDC. According to the report, 762 aliens were detained in the 11 months after 9/11; Elmaghraby and Iqbal were among 84 of those designated \"high interest\" by the FBI and held in maximum- security conditions. The report would later find that the atmosphere at the MDC immediately after September 11 was \"emotionally charged\", with detainees being handed over to teams of five to seven officers who were, in the words of their colleagues, \"spiked with adrenaline ... getting ready for battle ... talking crazy\". Several detainees complained that they were slammed into walls on arrival and a criminal investigation was launched when one alleged that he had been injured by staff. Officers were then required to videotape proceedings whenever detainees were outside their cells, though they did not always do so. The day after his arrest, Elmaghraby says, he was woken at 7am in his cell and ordered to strip. Five corrections officers searched him, then bent his arms back through a slot in the door and chained him to it while they searched the cell. Later, on the way to court for his arraignment, he was strip-searched three times at three different levels of the MDC. His suit alleges that one officer inserted a flashlight into his anal cavity and he saw blood when it was removed. He says this is entered in his medical records; these records are subject to a protective order and his lawyer cannot discuss them. That first day, he alleges that his wife, who was present at the arraignment, was threatened with arrest by the FBI. For whatever reason, it would be the last time he saw or heard from her. She does have two children, he reminds me, and \"I figure she's scared.\" Elmaghraby was denied bail: the report records that the FBI instituted a blanket \"no bond\" policy for all 9/11 detainees. He was initially allowed no phone calls or contact with the outside world. \"I felt crazy, you know? About the restaurant, and about everything outside, and the fact that nobody knew anything about me, and even my wife had disappeared.\" The cell had a bed, a toilet and a shower, but he says he was given no blanket, pillow, mattress or toilet paper and no newspapers, TV or radio. Two cameras observed everything and the lights were left on all the time - a measure, the report concluded, that was \"unduly harsh\", especially as it was accompanied by checks for which they were woken every couple of hours. He was not allowed to speak to other prisoners, one of whom, briefly, was Zacarias Moussaoui, the only man actually prosecuted in connection with September 11. What did he do all day? \"Read the Qur'an and prayed.\" Did he pray before? \"No!\" He no longer drinks, and is a little more religious than he once was - though, he laughs, he still goes to nightclubs. On November 1, five weeks into his detention and desperate to speak to a lawyer, he went on hunger strike. On November 6, he finally spoke to his court-appointed criminal counsel. This obfuscation of the legal process was not, the report found, unusual: \"The MDC's restrictive and inconsistent policies on telephone access for detainees prevented them from obtaining legal counsel in a timely manner.\" Furthermore, the inspector general wrote, \"We found that MDC staff frequently - and mistakenly - told people who inquired about a specific September 11 detainee that the detainee was not held at the facility when, in fact, the opposite was true.\" Elmaghraby's elderly father travelled from Egypt to see him and went to the MDC three times. The first two times they denied holding his son. The third time, Elmaghraby alleges, his father was threatened with jail. Defeated, he decided to go home; back in Alexandria, as he was recounting this to his wife and daughter, he suffered a major stroke. Elmaghraby was only permitted to call home for the first time on December 26. \"The minute I spoke to my father he started to cry and I started to cry. He didn't want to tell me he was sick, but he sounded [it]. He didn't want to tell me until he was actually able to see me. I couldn't say anything and I couldn't do anything. What could I do?\" The formal recorded reason for Elmaghraby's imprisonment was credit-card fraud; as for terrorism, his court-appointed criminal lawyer, Deborah Colson, was only ever told that the FBI was investigating possible links. He was never officially charged with terrorist activities. (The Department of Justice will not comment on this, or any other part of the case.) Colson filed a motion that objected to the harsh conditions Elmaghraby was being held under and requested that he be moved into the general prison population. The request was denied. This denial, alleges Elmaghraby, meant that his treatment worsened. It wasn't unusual to be strip-searched twice a day and on each court day, to be strip- and body cavity-searched three times on the way there and three times on the way back. All detainees were moved through the facility in leg shackles, with their hands cuffed behind them. Sometimes they wore waist chains as well. Once, he says, he was left naked for 40 minutes; on other occasions, he was stripped in front of a woman; on others, he was mocked. Once he was probed with a pencil. Technically, prisoners in isolation are allowed an hour of exercise a day; the first time he asked for this, he says, in late November 2001, it was \"a big mistake\". He was taken to the roof at 6:45am, when it was still dark, and left there until 10am. \"I think this day was 20 below zero. They took me with a jumpsuit, no coat, and no shoes, just white socks. I was so cold I couldn't talk. I couldn't walk, I couldn't open my mouth.\" He says he was shoved and hit and sworn at: \"Muslim bastard.\" \"Muslim killer.\" Twenty-two detainees alleged verbal abuse and threats; Elmaghraby alleges that, on his first day, he was threatened with death. Corrections officers categorically denied to the inspector general that they abused or intimidated the prisoners. But the videotapes they were required to make contradicted them. On the videos, investigators saw a practice whereby guards would \"escort detainees down a hall at a brisk pace and ram them into a wall without slowing before impact\"; they saw guards bounce detainees off walls, deliberately press detainees' heads against walls, bend thumbs backwards, step on leg restraints, usually when detainees \"were being fully compliant and not resisting\". They heard detainees routinely referred to as \"fuckers\", \"terrorists\", \"dirtbags\" or \"scumbags\". By the spring of 2002, Elmaghraby says, he would have done anything to leave. \"If they wanted to take one of my eyes, I'd have said OK.\" So he pleaded guilty to credit-card fraud, of which he now insists he is innocent. He hoped for a sentence of time served, but got 24 months. He ended up spending 11 months in isolation. Eventually, he threatened another hunger strike and was transferred to Ray Brook, in New York state, to serve out his sentence. By this time, he was ill. He had lost about two stones and was waking each night, chest burning, feeling as though he was being strangled. In the MDC, he had been informed he had asthma, but at Ray Brook he discovered that it was actually a hypothyroid condition, which had been exacerbated by the asthma medication. He has been in and out of hospital ever since, which has prevented him from working; at the end of March, he had an operation which he hopes will eventually allow him to get back to work. The Elmaghraby case may be a small step towards accountability and an embarrassment for the US authorities, but in some ways these are not the most important things about it. For one thing, it proves that the dragnet of Middle-Eastern men after 9/11 caught almost no fish. Terrorist Trials: A Report Card, published by the Center on Law and Security at the NYU School of Law, examined all September 11-related arrests and convictions and concluded that the \"legal war on terror has yielded few visible results. There have been relatively few indictments, fewer trials and almost no convictions on charges reflecting dangerous crimes ... For a society and government that has spent billions reorganising the fight in terror at home, the legal record shows scant results.\" Particularly worrying, says Karen Greenberg, who directed the research, was the level of secrecy they encountered. \"The cases would all of a sudden just disappear off the screen and we'd have to call the courts and chase them down.\" In the Elmaghraby/Iqbal and class action cases, lawyers for the defendants (the US government) have designated 20,000 documents as subject to a protective order. No one is allowed to talk about them, or what they contain. But what is most striking are the terms on which the government chose to fight the cases. \"There is an actual line in Mr Ashcroft's brief,\" says Alexander Reinert, one of Elmaghraby's lawyers, \"that rules created in peacetime don't apply in times of war. It's a remarkably broad argument. It doesn't just apply to Arab Muslim men, it applies to everybody, and basically suggests that none of us, in the days and months after September 11, had these rights that we all thought were fundamental.\" \"The most enduring part of this case,\" says Joshua Dratel, co-editor of The Torture Papers: The Road to Abu Ghraib, and lawyer for David Hicks, an Australian held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, \"may be that the judge squarely rejected the notion that we are in some sort of twilight zone where rules don't apply and the government can act in a lawless fashion and use terrorism as an excuse to get away with it.\" But judges cannot be relied upon to repeat this decision. There is a similar motion to dismiss pending in the class action suit. If it is upheld, that case will evaporate. In August 2003, Elmaghraby was deported. He had lost his home, his wife, his stepchildren, two businesses, three cars, photographs, clothes. At the airport he said to his guards, \"Do me a favour, I don't want to go to Egypt like this. Can't I buy something to wear?\" He kitted himself out in DKNY and bought $900-worth of perfume to take home. In Alexandria, he has married again, a 23-year-old called Mai whom he met through family. They have a baby daughter, Darin. He is surprised at how pleased he is to be a father, he says. But he is deeply in debt to his family and to the bank. Over the two days I was in Alexandria, this was his main preoccupation - whether the $300,000 would arrive in time to save him from a final court date and loss of his home. I call him shortly after I leave. The money has arrived just in time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
