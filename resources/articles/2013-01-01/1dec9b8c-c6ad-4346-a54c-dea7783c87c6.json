Some call it his biggest broken promise. So there is much to talk about, and the charity Cageprisoners \u2013 created to \"help those who have been detained or abused within the context of the war on terror\" \u2013 hoped to do just that with a London conference on 11 January, but says it has been forced to postpone. Why? \"Unfortunately, due to restrictions imposed by the Guant\u00e1namo Bay Military Commissions Convening Authority, the majority of our invited speakers had their permissions to travel denied,\" the charity tells supporters. The bans are being challenged but won't be overturned in time, so they'll try to stage the debate later in the year. The prez may just have recovered from selective amnesia by then. \u2022 A spectacular ascent into 2013, but waiting for the fireworks over the Thames, the festive mood was momentarily blighted by hearing the recorded voice of the mayor of London, Boris Johnson. All was saved, however, when the background music suddenly switched to ancient rockers the Who singing: \"Who are you? Who, who, who, who?\" Coincidence? Or an astutely ironic DJ? Fortuitous, either way. \u2022 It's been 15 months, but John Terry's footballer's mansion to end them all on a crown estate in Surrey is still not occupied by Lord and Lady JT. Nineteen rooms in total, including eight bedrooms and six bathrooms, it would put many a Dallas ranch-house to shame. What's more, it's the spare gaffe, as he lives next door in another \u00a34m mansion. But the excavator is still out front, the lawns have yet to be laid and there was no sign of the Terrys over the festive season. By hook or crook, he'll get things moving in 2013. But he's a canny one. More haste, less speed. \u2022 Robust views were on display as various media marked the passing of Sir Irvine Patnick, the ex-Tory MP who did much to help the Sun put the boot in after the Hillsborough disaster. \"Source for Sun story that smeared Liverpool fans after Hillsborough disaster dies, aged 83,\" said the Independent. \"Hillsborough smear former MP dies,\" said the Belfast Telegraph. \"Source behind shameful Hillsborough tragedy coverage dies, aged 83,\" said the Mirror. But the Sun, without a hint of self-interest, saw things a little differently. \"The former member for Sheffield Hallam was among a number of people who had been given 'wholly inaccurate' information by police \u2013 which he repeated without checking,\" it said. Admirably precise, in its way. \u2022 We are still musing on that when our friend Cal McCrystal gets in touch. He has news. It is really quite worrying. \"There is a possibility that you are related to Rupert Murdoch,\" he says. \"Research shows that the name originated in Ireland as Muiredach, a member of the O'Daly family, which had a literary role as a bardic clan by the 12th century. According to Seamus MacManus in The Story of the Irish Race, Muiredach was highly respected as the King's poet at the court of Cathal Crodhearg of Connaught. However, he was forced to flee to Scotland in 1113 after refusing to pay rent to the steward of the powerful O'Donnells.\" Muiredach's response was \"splitting the steward's head with a battle axe\". He then recited a poem about it. Muiredach settled in Islay, becoming great friends with Donald, Lord of the Isles and, according to Cal, \"the native Scots claimed Muiredach as their own, bestowing on him the title Muiredach Albanach and warmly welcoming Muiredach's newborn son, Lachlan\". Here's the worry. \"Some descendants dropped the \"dach\" or \"doch\" part of the name and called themselves Muire, or occasionally Muir, which means sea. Muiredach, according to the author McManus, used to mean sea lord. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you,\" says Cal. A little after the event, you might think. Still, there is nowt one can do about relatives. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
