The competition, which Chile host, starts less than two weeks after Arsenal\u2019s date with Aston Villa at Wembley, which takes place on 30 May. \u201cWe got an agreement they won\u2019t call him,\u201d said Wenger. \u201cThey could call him up. Anyway, I am sure he would not go!\u201d It could be a thorny issue for any South American players who qualify for the Champions League final, which is played on 6 June. Fifa rules require clubs to release their players 14 days before the start of an international tournament, so some manoeuvring may well be required for the likes of Neymar at Barcelona, James Rodr\u00edguez of Real Madrid, Arturo Vidal of Juventus and Bayern Munich\u2019s Dante. Wenger has noted that S\u00e1nchez, Arsenal\u2019s top scorer this campaign, could miss the start of next season if Chile progress in the Copa Am\u00e9rica. The final will be played on 4 July, just over a month before the opening weekend of the next Premier League season. Wenger insists on giving all players at least one month\u2019s holiday, before they commence pre-season training. \u201cIt\u2019s not good news because they finish very late and if Chile go very far he will miss the start of the season,\u201d said Wenger. Chile have never won the Copa Am\u00e9rica, and last reached the final in the year after S\u00e1nchez was born. The Arsenal attacker is the third most capped Chilean player of all time, and ranks fourth in their goalscoring charts, 11 goals behind record holder Marcelo Salas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
