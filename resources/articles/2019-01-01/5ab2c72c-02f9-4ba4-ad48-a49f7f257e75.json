The teachers were demanding that the legislature increase the education fund to pre-recession levels and to raise teacher pay, which lags $9,400 behind the national average despite Virginia being the 12 wealthiest state per-capita in the United States. Activists with Virginia Educators United had expected only 2,000 people to turn out for the event and said they were delighted by the scale of the event, the latest in a series of actions by teachers across the US. \u201cI am ecstatic about today\u2019s turnout especially because sometimes, we as teachers don\u2019t always come out, we don\u2019t always speak out, we don\u2019t always let our voices be heard, so I am excited that we are out here today doing just that,\u201d said Milondra Coleman, who teaches at John Marshall High in Richmond. Although the walkout lasted for only one day and many school districts in Virginia did not participate, Coleman said that the action gave teachers a new sense of confidence and power. \u201cI think this will definitely take us to a different level,\u201d said Coleman. \u201cI think one of the things that teachers often fear is that there will be some type of repercussions for speaking out. So I think today shows that, you know what, we can do it and there aren\u2019t going to be any repercussions, and instead there can be positive things that can happen for taking the time to speak out.\u201d For the majority of the teachers in the streets of Richmond, the action was their first. \u201cThis is my first time coming out to be involved and it\u2019s just wonderful,\u201d said Caitlin Dunn, a 26-year-old English teacher from Newport News as she struggled to carry a giant 10-ft-tall puppet clad in the #RedforEd motto that has been used by striking teachers at other events. \u201cTeachers my age are walking out because when it comes to making a choice for themselves between supporting themselves or continuing in education, they are quitting because they are to able to make a living wage,\u201d said Dunn. Monday\u2019s action is the latest in a series of strikes and actions by teachers, who have been mobilized following successful teachers\u2019 strikes in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Arizona and Los Angeles that have inspired a new movement nationwide. The strike fever has won not just the support of teachers, but also politicians such as Richmond\u2019s school superintendent, Jason Kamras, who closed schools on Monday in solidarity; releasing more than 3,000 of the city\u2019s teachers into the streets. \u201cYou are either with public schools or you\u2019re not and we need to make sure the assembly remembers that when everybody votes in November,\u201d Kamras told the rally. Previously, Kamras had helped lead anti-teacher union initiatives in Washington DC but in a sign of how much things have changed Karmas stood today on the side of teachers\u2019 union leaders he had previously fought. \u201cIt is no secret that we have had issues with [Jason Kamras] over the years,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, American Federation of Teachers president. \u201cI applaud him being out there with teachers today.\u201d Currently, the Virginia state legislature is narrowly controlled by Republicans who hold a one-seat majority in the state house and a two-seat majority in the state senate while Democrat Ralph Northam controls the governor\u2019s mansion. Northam has proposed $750m in tax breaks for Amazon to relocate to northern Virginia, and he has proposed to increase education funding by $269m \u2013 a figure that is only a quarter of what educators are demanding to bring Virginia\u2019s education budget up to pre-recession levels. With elections for the state legislature set for this November in Virginia, teachers\u2019 unions intend to invest big in electing teachers\u2019 union advocates. Judging by the thousands in the streets of Richmond on Monday, the National Education Association president, Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, said she was optimistic. \u201cThere is a judgment day that will come and this is what democracy looks like, \u201d says Garc\u00eda."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
