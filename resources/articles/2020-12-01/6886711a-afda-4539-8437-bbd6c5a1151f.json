The 43-year-old Mayweather announced the fight, which will take place on 20 February, in an Instagram post on Sunday. Although the 25-year-old Paul has nearly two decades on his opponent, he is unlikely to trouble a man who retired from professional boxing undefeated with a 50-0 record. Both men have fought lucrative exhibitions in the past. Mayweather was estimated to have earned more than $100m from his fight with UFC star Conor McGregor in 2017, and $9m from an exhibition against Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa in 2018. Paul, meanwhile, fought fellow YouTuber KSI in a professional bout last year, which he lost. Both men made millions of dollars from the fight. February\u2019s fight will be streamed as a pay-per-view. The first 1m customers will pay $24.99, with the price rising to $69.99 closer to the fight. Paul should have no problem attracting an audience: he has more than 22m subscribers on YouTube."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
