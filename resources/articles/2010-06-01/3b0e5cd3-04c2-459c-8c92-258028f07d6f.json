I'm sure Fabio Capello will take his goalkeeper aside and offer reassuring words in private and in public. And he'll be wrestling with a major dilemma as he does so. There is nothing to be gained by recrimination. Criticising Green is not going to help England's World Cup campaign and, let's be honest, his mistake has taken the heat off one or two outfield players who did not perform too well against the USA. Green is a good goalkeeper who has saved his team many times. He will do again. Had England scored a second and won the game we would be discussing an error that cost a goal, not one that cost two points and has had an effect on the remainder of the group games. But a goalkeeper doesn't have the luxury of making a mistake that doesn't matter and now the England manager, his captain, the entire squad in fact, must show unity. The early signs have been encouraging in that respect. \u2022 Follow the Guardian's World Cup team on Twitter \u2022 Sign up to play our great Fantasy Football game \u2022 Stats centre: Get the lowdown on every player \u2022 The latest team-by-team news, features and more I was impressed with how Joe Hart didn't disappear down the tunnel at half-time but waited for Green and put his arm around him. It would have been extremely difficult to console the goalkeeper in that situation, but he would have wanted to know he had support before he stepped into that dressing room. Here is a young player who wants to play in the World Cup himself and that was a nice, important gesture from Hart. Facing up to a mistake is a big part of getting over it, and I thought it was fantastic that Green came out and faced the music. He didn't shy away as many players would have done. He will feel the weight of the world on his shoulders right now, he will know that everyone is analysing him and criticising him back home, but he stood in front of his questioners immediately afterwards and took responsibility. The dilemma for Capello now is whether he continues with Green against Algeria. Basically, he is damned if he does stick with him and damned if he makes a change. If he drops the goalkeeper he will be accused of making a mistake by selecting Green in the first place. If he keeps faith, and there is another mistake, they will both be crucified. Green will be desperate to make amends against Algeria, although I'd argue he made amends with that save from Jozy Altidore, but Capello will monitor him in training and assess his reaction before making a final decision based on cold, hard fact. Sometimes you have to make a change for the good of the player and Green will be under enormous pressure with that mistake hanging over him. Senior players also have a role to play, but the England captaincy is not as straightforward as it has been. Steven Gerrard has only just received the armband from Rio Ferdinand; he only got the captaincy because it was taken from John Terry, and England need an established captain to take it upon himself to help lift Green without the instruction of Fabio Capello. It would be easier for Gerrard to get his message across at Liverpool, where he sees his team-mates every day, but it now falls to him and other senior players to pull everyone together. A squad becomes like a family in a World Cup, with all its problems, and it must remain close. I had a similar situation at Wolves, after Chris Iwelumo missed an open goal for Scotland against Norway in the World Cup qualifiers. I knew Chris's phone would be off straight after the game so I sent him a text, then rang him later that evening. We had a good conversation. I gave him my support, told him these things can happen and that he had to move on from it as quickly as he could. And of course what happened? He came into training first thing on the Monday morning and the lads took the piss out of him mercilessly. They spent the entire training session trying to recreate that opening against Norway and taunting Chris over whether he could put one away. There is a limit to sympathy in football but not, as Chris discovered, to black humour. Later on he said how he appreciated my phone call but also how the lads got straight into him in training. It is far worse to have the silent treatment or to feel that everyone is whispering behind your back, and it is the sign of a top athlete or footballer how quickly they move on from a mistake. Green, and England, must."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
