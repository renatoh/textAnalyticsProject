As the 35-year-old Swiss contemplates the challenge of becoming the oldest finalist here since Ken Rosewall 43 years ago, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, who were cut down so cruelly by injury and the stress of a physical sport in the quarter-finals, could do worse than heed his example and walk away from the game for six months. It is a formula that has worked as no other in the recent history of the sport. \u201cLast year I had a hard, hard time practising through the clay-court season,\u201d Federer said on the eve of his semi-final on Friday against Tomas Berdych. \u201cThe grass-court season was difficult because of the back issues I had and the knee issues. I could never play quite so freely last year. This year I\u2019m just a normal tennis player again.\u201d The last utterance is plainly nonsense. There is nothing normal about Federer, who has floated through his sport with winged feet and hands of gold. But he eventually succumbed to the rigours of his calling last year \u2013 initiated by that bizarre wrenching of his knee in a Melbourne hotel while turning on the bath water for one of his children \u2013 and he reluctantly endured the pain and consequences of surgery. After six months he returned, came from 3-1 down in the fifth set to defeat Rafael Nadal in the final of the 2017 Australian Open and, in a twinkling, had reinvented himself. After extending the fairytale further in America he began to feel the strain again after winning in Miami, skipped the European clay-court season and returned for the grass of Stuttgart, Halle and Wimbledon, where he is favoured to win an eighth title on Sunday. After beating Milos Raonic in three sets on Wednesday he spared a thought for his 30-year-old rivals Murray and Djokovic. The Scot, whose hip finally gave up on him in losing against Sam Querrey in five sets, and his team saw a specialist on Thursday. The Serb retired in the second set against Berdych when an 18-month-old injury to his right elbow flared again. \u201cYou wish them well right away, as a rival to them and a friend,\u201d Federer said. \u201cYou want them to be healthy again. It does happen, you know. Once you hit 30, you\u2019ve got to look back and think of how much tennis have I played, how much rest did I give my body over the years, how much training have I done, did I do enough, did I overdo it. \u201cFor me [taking a long rest] worked out. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to work out for everybody. But sometimes maybe the body and the mind do need a rest. The problem is you can only play with a certain injury for a certain amount of time, because what you don\u2019t want happening is that it becomes chronic. Then even a surgery can\u2019t help you that much any more. That\u2019s why I\u2019m happy I\u2019ve had to take my first surgery at 34 years old. \u201cThe idea was that the second week of Wimbledon I would feel my best. I feel like it\u2019s coming along nicely, to be quite honest. I\u2019m just very happy that I\u2019m still doing so well. \u201cAm I surprised? Maybe a little bit. But the plan was always, hopefully, to be strong also later on in my career.\u201d In an altogether different era it worked for Rosewall too, who was 39 when he played in that 1974 final. However, he lost. There are no guarantees, whatever the strength of sentiment for players raging against time. Federer again is the voice of contentment, however \u2013 and he will be happier still if he beats Berdych, who put him out in the quarter\u2011finals here seven years ago before going on to lose in the final to Nadal. The Czech has again gone under the radar here, with four quiet wins until the drama of the Djokovic retirement. \u201cI\u2019m not playing tennis for anyone else,\u201d he said later. \u201cI\u2019m just playing it for myself. I\u2019m happy with the way I handle it so far. I\u2019m having a good run.\u201d Marin Cilic, a former US Open champion playing his best tennis in years, should have the better of it against Querrey, who is unfamiliar with these heady surroundings, but he could struggle in a final against Federer, who can then return to Switzerland with Mirka and their four children to mull over the most astonishing comeback in modern sport."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
