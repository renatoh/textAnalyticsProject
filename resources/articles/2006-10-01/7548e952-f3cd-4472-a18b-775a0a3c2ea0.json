We are suffering from what is known in philosophical circles as the channel-hopping, YouTube-trucking, Google-gorging, MySpace-sniffing, post-millennial, post-post-modern condition. In short, the thinkers tell us, we are so busy flicking between Match of the Day, the Live Carp Fishing World Cup Finals and the Burnage Allcomers Ten-Pin Bowling Championship (as camcordered by Noel Gallagher's mam) that we don't have time to watch sport properly. This perceived concentration crisis does not apply solely to sport, of course. We are said to have the same problems with the world in general. But we can't demand that disasters or politics happen in easily digestible bite-size chunks. With sport, we can. So what do sport's decision makers go and do? Change the rules. Take snooker. Obviously, sponsors and television stations fear we are incapable of watching a grown-up match over a grown-up number of frames. So they devise a tournament in which competitors play the best of five frames in a round-robin. My beloved Rocket Ronnie O'Sullivan has announced that he likes the new format, but what does he know? He's only a player, and one who gets bored very quickly at that. I'm a fan, I'm the one who has to suffer those tortuous nights of the soul, I know the kind of snooker that's best for me. The trouble with the best of five frames is that any half-decent player could win it. The game becomes a lottery. Eight years ago, the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu published a book called On Television which condemned TV for shrinking our concentration span. Everything, he said, is mediated, sieved and collated by television, so ultimately all we can cope with is a distillation of great moments. Bourdieu died in 2002. I don't know if he was a snooker fan, but my guess is that if he'd been around for the Aberdeen Grand Prix or Twenty20 cricket he'd be shouting \"exactement!\" at his telly. This is a sporting culture in which instant gratification is all; a culture constantly in search of its next heroin hit or petit mort. It is also a culture in thrall to the market. Why do we watch cricket? To see sixes and wickets. Hey then, why not make every ball a six or a wicket? But in trying to give each moment consummate meaning, we devalue everything. Without lowlights you don't get the highlights; without the boring bits, sport's major dramas are rendered meaningless. Take football's quest for the quick fix. How many of us truly think of Italy as world champions? I don't. Why? Because they won on penalties, and penalties don't count. This year's FA Cup final? Wonderful match, but who really won? Nobody, because it was decided on penalties. What's the logical conclusion? Snooker's World Championship decided on one ball - no frames, just place the black on its spot and the first to pot it wins. The Ashes reduced to a magnificent climactic experience known as One1, in which each side uses its best bowler to bowl one over at the opposition's best batsman, who tries to score as many runs as possible. Football's World Cup final? That could be decided on the toss. Imagine the hours of fun that would leave for Alan Shearer to analyse how the ref screwed it up. Many of our sporting landmarks would not have happened under today's rules. Ricky Villa's winning goal (and the brilliant Steve Mackenzie volley) in the Spurs v Manchester City 1981 FA Cup final replay would be history. Or rather it wouldn't be - the final would have been decided on the Saturday on penalties. As for the timeless Test between South Africa and England in 1939, spanning nine days and ending with England, on the cusp of victory, having to get the boat home. . . that would have ended in a draw with both sides having barely batted an innings each. And the longest singles match in tennis history? These days, John McEnroe's 6hr 32min victory by 9-7, 6-2, 15-17, 3-6, 8-6 over Mats Wilander in the Davis Cup in 1982 might have ended four hours earlier in a third-set tie-break victory for McEnroe. The TV schedulers and philosophers and bureaucrats have got it wrong. Many of the greatest events are memorable because of their epic nature. The last great sporting contest? The 2005 Ashes - a five-Test series that stretched over summer and into autumn and wasn't decided until the final session of the final day. The next great sporting contest? Roll on the Ashes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
