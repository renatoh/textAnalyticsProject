One afternoon in 1990, the then 23-year-old psychology student got a call from her beloved dad. \u201cHe said, \u2018Oh, Urs, hope you\u2019re not going to be cross with me\u2019,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI said, \u2018Why would I be cross with you?\u2019 He said, \u2018Well I sort of gave your phone number to this man\u2019.\u201d Her dad owned a computer monitor and TV repair shop in Melbourne and the then 32-year-old Simon, who worked in IT, was one of his regulars. Her matchmaking dad and his wife thought Simon was so nice that Ursula should meet him too. At the time, Simon remembers thinking: \u2018Really? Do I look that desperate?\u2019 He was recently single and happily contemplating a solo life. He held off on calling Ursula for a few months, but eventually rang and suggested coffee. Ursula, who\u2019d forgotten about her dad\u2019s intervention, impulsively agreed. \u201cI said, \u2018Oh no, not coffee, but you can take me out for dinner and bring wine.\u2019\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d be like: \u201cI expected him to look a bit like my Dad, a bushy ginger beard and not much style,\u201d she remembers, \u201cbut he was very handsome, and I was struck by his beautiful blue eyes.\u201d He was similarly impressed: \u201cShe answered the door in a red miniskirt, and that gorgeous face. And that was it,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my luck.\u201d They hit it off immediately. \u201cIt was quite a novel experience for me to feel seen and heard,\u201d says Ursula, who was taken with Simon\u2019s kindness. \u201cAnd to watch a man talk about people, the world and interact with animals and things in a really loving and caring way.\u201d Simon says it was clear, as a psychologist, Ursula cared about others \u2013 and him. \u201cI found somebody that was fun, was her own person, wasn\u2019t dependent on me, wasn\u2019t needy, just let me be who I was,\u201d he says. \u201cI really didn\u2019t know how to live life as such. She taught me how to enjoy myself.\u201d There was a connection despite their differences: \u201cI\u2019m always a bit more squinchy-eyed when I\u2019m analysing people \u2026 seeing perhaps not-so-good motivations, whereas Simon always sees the good in people,\u201d says Ursula. \u201cBut I think despite that, we have the same values, and we always did, of honesty, loyalty, integrity, commitment, and caring for one another.\u201d She adds: \u201cAnd for me, Simon always made me feel, and he still does, adored.\u201d Things soon started to get serious. About a month in, Ursula got a call from an old flame, inviting her up to Sydney. For a moment she was unsure but decided to tell Simon. Although he understood, he said he wouldn\u2019t wait for her. She realised what she was doing. \u201c[I thought] What am I even comparing here? There\u2019s no choice. There\u2019s no competition. Of course I want to be with Simon and see where this goes. Where there\u2019s all these indications that this is going to be a healthy, equal, respectful relationship.\u201d Simon remembers the turning point: \u201cWhen she didn\u2019t go, and she told me why, I thought \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to make this go as best I can. Give it as good an effort as I can, and if it doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work. But if it does, it does.\u2019\u201d But it was about six years before Ursula was ready to marry Simon, and as a psychologist, she spent time in therapy considering whether it was the right decision: \u201cMy hesitation was never about thinking that maybe there was someone better, or Simon wasn\u2019t right. It was always about taking marriage vows really literally and trying to project into the future \u2026 Can I 100% protect and shield, love and be this person\u2019s partner in life forever?\u201d She gave the idea of having children the same careful consideration, and a few years later, when they had their son, they threw out stereotypical gender roles. \u201cWe decided that as much as possible, we were both going to try to inhabit both worlds, so we didn\u2019t lose the connection and understanding for each other\u2019s reality that we had,\u201d says Ursula. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we did. We both worked part-time and we both were equally involved in raising Max and generating income. That really helped us.\u201d She adds: \u201c[Simon] knew what it was like to spend a day with a screaming baby \u2026 a dirty house, and nappies everywhere. And I knew what it was like to feel the pressure of \u2026 bringing income, and office politics.\u201d Says Simon: \u201cI don\u2019t think either of us felt we were doing one thing more than the other was doing.\u201d At work, Ursula specialises in helping those at risk from domestic violence. All day she\u2019s surrounded by horror stories, which she has slowly learned not to bring home. \u201cSex wasn\u2019t about love for the women that I would speak to \u2026 it would be about power and control. It would be a little bit of a mind shift \u2026 reminding myself that this man wasn\u2019t like the men that I heard about all day long.\u201d While Ursula has never tried to therapise her own family life, the fact that Simon was open to seeking outside help when he\u2019s struggled is a big reassurance for her. \u201cI know that it\u2019s mostly the people that really, really need therapy, that don\u2019t actually end up in therapy, because they spend a lot of their life compartmentalising and avoiding,\u201d she says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to share my life with someone like that \u2026 I knew that [Simon] was open to growth.\u201d A few years ago, Simon left his corporate IT role and the couple decided to work within Ursula\u2019s psychology practice. \u201cIt was one of the biggest challenges for me,\u201d says Simon. He\u2019d gone from a highly paid corporate job to one with almost no salary and he struggled to understand how their disparate skills worked together. Ursula was very hands-on, while Simon had been used to doing his own thing. \u201cAt one point, he did say I was the worst boss he\u2019d ever had,\u201d Ursula jokes. \u201cBut he has since walked that back [and] I\u2019m not his boss. We\u2019re co-directors.\u201d Eventually he found his feet: \u201cI really do feel like I\u2019ve got my own business now with Ursula, I\u2019m really part of that.\u201d Having him involved made a huge difference to Ursula: \u201cOnce Simon started [travelling] with me, it just felt such a relief that I wasn\u2019t alone in this anymore.\u201d Over their years together, they\u2019ve gotten better at dealing with conflict. In the early years, Simon says, \u201cI used to be the guy that would brood for days.\u201d Now, he says, his approach is different. \u201cI try and solve it before we go to sleep. Because I\u2019ll feel bruised but it is not relevant. This doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s a disagreement. We\u2019ve had a million of these things.\u201d Ursula, who used to be prone to storming off in arguments, agrees. \u201cWe both give each other a little bit of time, not too much time.\u201d They remind themselves that neither would deliberately hurt or upset the other. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that you\u2019re both hurting, and you need to come together again. Sometimes all it would take is, he would come in the room and go, \u2018So, what are we going to do about this?\u2019 And I might just get up and hug him.\u201d Their commitment to each other is unwavering. \u201cI don\u2019t like cliches really, but I do feel like we are soulmates,\u201d says Ursula. \u201cWhat that expression means to me is that we will always look after one another, no matter what. That we will always find ways to be on the same page.\u201d Simon puts it down to trust. \u201cJust not even thinking about whether somebody else is going to do the right thing by you. Assuming that that will be the case.\u201d They always try to understand where the other person is coming from, says Ursula. Little gestures help \u2013 Simon makes a point of bringing Ursula coffee each morning and telling her how he feels about her. \u201cThese are small things, but they\u2019re really important to Ursula. And I get a lot out of that, and I know she gets a lot out of that, so I give her a lot of that.\u201d We want to hear your stories about staying together.
