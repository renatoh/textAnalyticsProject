Better times await. The Faroe Islands, ranked 169th in the world and fresh from losing their opening group game 6-0 at home to Georgia, confront the hosts at Celtic Park this afternoon before next week's trip to Lithuania. These opponents sent shockwaves through Berti Vogts' regime by humiliating the German in qualification for Euro 2004, but the sense persists that Scotland under Smith are a team in resurgence. Where recently the Scots may have shuddered in apprehension at potential shocks, now they recognise a chance to generate early momentum. That, of course, brings its own pressure. \"There is obviously an onus on us to get off to a good start, knowing that we have other extremely tough games to come in the section,\" Smith conceded. \"That is as bit of pressure placed on us. But there's no getting away from the fact that the expectation level is one we have to match in this game. I just want us to show that we can go out and create opportunities. We'll need to do that if we're going to outwit some of the top teams in this group. \"We've achieved some decent results in the 18 months since I've come in, and I'm more than happy with the way the players have responded. We've given ourselves a platform to start our new campaign and show there has been an improvement. \"You don't set out in a group to finish third. If you're going to be competitive, you attempt to do as well as you possibly can. But this group poses different challenges and this match is about us showing enough attacking strength to win the game.\" Asked whether the Scots will be more \"gung-ho\" today, Smith merely replied: \"Yes.\" That will be reflected in a bold selection, with James McFadden likely to start behind the forward partnership of Kenny Miller and Kris Boyd, enjoying contrasting fortunes with the Old Firm this term. Scotland managed only nine goals in their 10 World Cup qualifying games. The hope is that they can emulate Georgia's display this afternoon to set an upbeat tone, though few in this squad would dare underestimate their visitors. The assistant manager Tommy Burns and the veteran defenders David Weir and Christian Dailly have been at pains to remind their team-mates this week of the ignominy endured in Toftir four years ago when the Faroes briefly led 2-0 before Vogts' side clawed back parity if not dignity. Weir subsequently retired from international football, stung by the criticism he had endured from Vogts in the wake of the draw. He will captain the side today and is eager to avoid a repeat. The Faroe Islanders have been amused at the Scots' desire to recall the Toftir debacle but Smith is firm. \"I don't think there's anything the matter with reflecting upon 'the bad days' against the Faroe Islands because that shows you what can happen if you're not on top of your game. We know the pitfalls only too well. It's not harmful to have them remind everybody what it was like. \"But we shouldn't think this will be easy. [The Faroes] may only have got a point from their qualification campaign for 2006 but the World Cup finalists, France, were only 1-0 up going into the latter stages of the game in Paris and scored two goals late on to win 3-0. There have obviously been stages in these games when countries higher up the rankings than Scotland have been frustrated. It's something we'll have to handle. I don't think there's any great mystery about how they'll come and play. They will sit in. There's no question, because they do it in home games. It's entirely up to us to take the game to them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
