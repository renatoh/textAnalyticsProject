Trimble's gloomy assessment cast a pall of gloom over the negotiations headed by Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, in their quest to save the agreement from collapse. His comments are a direct challenge to the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach, both of whom have stated that there is no alternative to the Good Friday Agreement. The leader of the province's largest unionist party told The Observer that he was sceptical that the IRA would make a radical move to put its illegal arsenal of arms and explosives beyond use - the central issue blocking progress. He said: 'They [the IRA] cannot move from their position on arms. This means that we are into Plan B and I think there is going to have to be a substantial review of the agreement. I'm not saying that will definitely happen but there is every possibility we will be into a review.' While the two Prime Ministers will deliver their plan to break the deadlock on Wednesday, Trimble said some of the 'major architecture' of the agreement would have to be changed. Sinn Fein last night criticised his remarks as evidence that Trimble had moved to the anti-agreement faction within the Ulster Unionist Party. Gerry Kelly, the former IRA bomber and Sinn Fein assemblyman, accused Trimble of joining the rejectionist camp. Unionists say they cannot remain in government with Sinn Fein while the IRA retains its weapons. They allege the terrorists are continuing to kill, carrying out so-called punishment attacks and raising funds from robberies. Republicans say IRA guns are silent and that unionists have ignored ongoing loyalist terrorism. Irish government sources have indicated that the IRA is considering placing a concrete cap on top of two huge arms bunkers hidden in the Irish Republic as a gesture to help break the deadlock. But unionists want the concrete poured into the bunkers to make the arms and explosives permanently inaccessible. The plan would be overseen by John de Chastelain, the Canadian general in charge of dealing with the disposal of terrorist arms under the auspices of the International Commission on Decommissioning. However, Trimble said that republicans appeared 'unable' to allow De Chastelain to ensure that the weapons were put permanently beyond use. 'A concrete cap is not enough, the dumps have to be permanently unusable and inaccessible,' he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
