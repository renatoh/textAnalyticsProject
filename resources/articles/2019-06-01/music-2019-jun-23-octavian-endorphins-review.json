His second mixtape confidently straddles not just the Thames (north Londoner Skepta figures on the previously released, ice-cold Bet) but the Atlantic, enlisting US guest rappers and reaching instinctually for trap beats on tracks such as Lit, rather than grime BPMs. Auto-Tune smears his sing-song vocals, to the point where all this hybridisation might add up to a loss of identity. Somehow, Octavian manages to buck these anonymising tendencies. His pop melodies are destined to travel, but retain an unapologetic London attitude and an experimental flair; much here is insidiously danceable. That\u2019s the good news: that Octavian is his own genre, not afraid to drop gospel (opener Gangster Love) alongside electric guitars (on his excellent remix of SBTRKT and Jessie Ware\u2019s Walking Alone). But the idea that he might be some sort of purist-baiting new school savant has yet to manifest in his lyrical work, which, while gruffly idiosyncratic, doesn\u2019t have a great deal new to say. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to fillet out a killer couplet in all Octavian\u2019s musings on drugs, oral sex, romance and thug life. It\u2019s how he delivers that convinces, not what he delivers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
