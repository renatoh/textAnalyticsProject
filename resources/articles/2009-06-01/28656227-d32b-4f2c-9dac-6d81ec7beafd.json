To say his Nigerian-born mother, Florence, is excited about his selection for the Lions Test team is the understatement of the tour and he suspects the decibel count will reach unprecedented levels if he happens to score a try this afternoon. \"Someone's going to have to look after her. She's got a big mouth on her and she'll be really excited. I'd hate to be with her this weekend.\" A call to Berkshire, nonetheless, remains a compulsory part of Monye's preparations before every game he plays. A devout Christian, he and Florence will talk and say a prayer together; having embraced the miracle of Skype, they now do so in sound and vision. \"I speak with her before every single game and we pray over the internet. I take a massive comfort from my faith. I'm a believer that what will be will be, that everything happens for a reason and that my selection was only because of God. Every time I go on the pitch I have a belief that everything will be all right. It gives me huge confidence.\" Even without the underlying driving force, Monye's rise is a remarkable tale. This time last year he was an uncapped reserve on the bench for the England Saxons in Chicago behind Tom Biggs and Matt Banahan. If that sounds slightly perverse now, Monye's advance has been stunning. His speed was never in doubt \u2013 as a 16-year-old he was clocked at 10.6sec for the 100 metres \u2013 but defensively he has been a revelation. His spectacular corner\u2011flagging tackle to cut down Scotland's Thom Evans in the Six Nations championship was merely the most eye\u2011catching example and the way he brought the big Southern Kings prop Jaco Engels to a shuddering halt down the narrow side on Tuesday probably sealed his selection, an accolade he describes as \"beyond my wildest dreams\". For anyone who was followed the warm-up matches, it was no less than the 26-year-old deserved. Shane Williams may be the international player of the year, but he has struggled to reproduce his best form. Leigh Halfpenny has gone home injured, Luke Fitzgerald has shown only flashes of his undoubted talent and Rob Kearney has played solely at full-back. None of them can match Monye's power and the 6ft 2in Harlequin has struck up a fruitful understanding with Ireland's Tommy Bowe. \"One for the Monye, two for the Bowe\" and \"Uuu-go, Uuu-go\" are fast becoming the soundtracks of the tour. Four tries in three starts also hints at a man determined to grasp any hint of an opportunity. A couple of years ago the Islington-born Monye had such a bad back, courtesy of a bulging disc that put pressure on his sciatic nerve, that he lay stricken on the floor of a friend's house for five days, unable to walk, let alone play rugby. It is another reason why he feels blessed at the way his life has subsequently panned out and sounds surprisingly undaunted. \"It will undoubtedly be the biggest day of my life but I just can't wait to get out there. You're representing a hell of a lot of people \u2013 the four nations, your family, the coaches who helped you on your way \u2013 but I don't feel a weight of expectation. I'm excited but I don't let it sink in too much. \"You've got to be hungry, get off your wing and get into the game as soon as possible. You'd be surprised how quickly 80 minutes flies by and you don't want everything to pass you by. Ultimately, when the whistle blows, it's just another rugby match.\" He may not feel quite the same when the first high ball plummets from the KwaZulu-Natal sky but South Africa may care to recall the precedent set in Brisbane in 2001 by another English left\u2011winger with a strong religious faith. No one present at the Gabba will ever forget Jason Robinson's classic early try against the Wallabies, not least because it was the last occasion the Lions won a Test match. Monye, who attended Lord Wandsworth College in Hampshire, the same school as Jonny Wilkinson, sees no reason why that sequence cannot end on Saturday. \"The team bond we have is fabulous. We all have the same vision and focus and that's to win the Test series. We're in their backyard but we're confident. I believe we've a fantastic squad which is very adaptable. We've got a big power game if we need it, great speed and some talented footballers. If we can get a mixture of all three, I think we've got a real good chance. It has been a great year but hopefully the best is yet to come.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
