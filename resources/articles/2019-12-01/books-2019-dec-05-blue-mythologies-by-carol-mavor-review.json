Art historian Carol Mavor\u2019s evocative and eclectic collection of essays demonstrates how true this is. Drawing on the history of art, photography, literature and her own memories, Mavor dives deep into an ocean of blueness: \u201cMy stories seek blue (duplicitous) truths which nevertheless ring true.\u201d She regards blue as being a \u201cparticularly paradoxical\u201d colour: \u201cblue is the purity of the Virgin Mary, yet blue names a movie as obscene\u201d. Blue is \u2013 as Rebecca Solnit has said \u2013 the \u201ccolour of longing for the distances you never arrive in\u201d. It is also the scattered light of the sky and the sea, Van Gogh\u2019s irises, the eternally elusive blue flower of Novalis and Romanticism, the icy blue of glaciers as well as \u201cthe snobbery of aristocratic blue blood\u201d and \u201cthe struggle of blue collar workers\u201d. It\u2019s the blue of the Hindu god Vishnu (\u201cthe optimistic colour of heavenly, infinite life\u201d), of delicate Chinese porcelain and of cyanotypes, camera-less photographs created by placing objects on to light-sensitive paper, such as Anna Atkins\u2019s ones of sea algae from 1843: exquisite blue and white images reminiscent of Matisse\u2019s paper cutouts. Sumptuously illustrated throughout, Mavor\u2019s writing \u2013 inspired by Roland Barthes\u2019s Mythologies \u2013 is rich with insights, both theoretical and personal. She segues effortlessly from her dreams (\u201cblue reveries in the darkness of my mind\u201d) and her mother\u2019s illness (\u201cHow does one mourn someone still alive, yet who is not of this world?\u201d) to blue in literature: Proust\u2019s aquamarine-eyed Albertine; how for Nabokov the letters of the alphabet were coloured by the blues of synaesthesia (\u201ca steely x, thunder-cloud z, and huckleberry k\u201d), to Thomas Mann\u2019s Death in Venice and Aschenbach\u2019s destructive desire for Tadzio. To quote Colette, Mavor is without doubt a true \u201cconnoisseur of blue\u201d. \u2022 Blue Mythologies is published by Reaktion (RRP \u00a314.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.
