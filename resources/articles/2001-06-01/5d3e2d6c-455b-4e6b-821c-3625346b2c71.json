That's still sound advice for the aspiring individual. But 'Go west, old manager' leads easily to the corporate graveyard. These repeated Western misadventures are conspicuous examples of a all too prevalent management disease: the bridge-too-far syndrome, which famously caused the Arnhem tragedy at the end of the war. The overreaching ambition that leads to a corporate Arnhem may not cause bloodshed - whatever price it gets for the Brooks Brothers menswear stores, M&amp;S didn't bet its whole business. But the Marksmen still made a costly bet they couldn't win. The losing gamblers will claim that criticism is mere hindsight. The creation of a global retailer was a laudable ambition for a company alleged by insiders and out siders alike to be the most innovative, profitable and efficient store chain in the world - and you can't be global without being American. Long before M&amp;S or Emap looked West, Britain's clearing banks poured gold into similar black holes. The automotive sector has also proved vulnerable: in the pursuit of global eminence, Daimler-Benz has endured like miseries with Chrysler. Any European company venturing Stateside risks going west unless its managers can overcome two sticky problems. First, Americans hate to give a sucker an even break. If you sincerely want to overpay for their property, they are only too happy to help. Second, Americans are far more than a transatlantic flight away. In their dangerously different commercial world, Europeans attempting to manage from 3,000 or more miles away are asking for disasters, permanent jet lag, and desperate disappointment with expensive local recruits. These two factors compound the usual risks of acquisition. But the bridge-too-far syndrome can rupture organic growth strategies just as viciously. The collective investment of the telcos in 3G mobile licences now looks like a contagious madness which the weaker sisters, such as BT, will be unable to afford. So what makes sane, experienced business people take decisions that could destroy the very shareholder value they profess to worship? The main force driving companies in the wrong direction is a management virtue - the will to win. But this can take an unhealthy turn into the Gadarene complex - in which all contestants weirdly go over the top because they fear being left behind. You can usually tell when this mania has taken hold from utterances such as this wonderful irrelevance from Michel Bon, CEO of France T\u00e9l\u00e9com: 'What was true in the past was that whatever you paid for a licence was a good deal'. As Bon's bon mot indicates, Gadarenists succumb to the line which art dealer Lord Duveen used to separate multi-millionaire Americans from their millions: 'If you're buying the priceless, you're getting it cheap.' Strategic ambition outweighs financial reality because the strategic benefits are believed - usually in the absence of realistic calculation - to be invaluable. And thus, paradoxically, value gets destroyed. The destructive mechanism is elementary. The basis of business economics - as simple as two and two makes four - is that you have to earn more on capital than the capital costs. But American firm Stern Stewart won fame by giving an invaluable twist to this simplicity. Managers, it argued, had done the wrong sums. They left out of the reckoning the largest element in capital cost: the cost of equity. That's far greater than the minus cule cost of the dividend. On the latter - misleading - basis, BT's pilloried management could congratulate themselves on passing the dividend and thus lowering the equity cost to zero. Equity capital is expected to return more than debt. If a company meets those expectations, and its operating profits exceed the weighted cost of all its capital, the result, in Stern Stewart's language, is positive economic value added or EVA. If EVA is negative, capital is being eaten away - and the shares (\u00e0 la BT) will very probably collapse. This fundamental truth cannot be evaded, although there is a conundrum to resolve. The British economy and shareholders suffer if managements make ill-judged plunges beyond their reach; but they also suffer if companies don't make bold ventures. National defeats in automotive markets and microelectronics sprang from over-cautious, unimaginative strategies. There could, in theory, have been a British Honda or Nokia. Honda's advance from motorbikes to motors was thought a ridiculous gamble at the time, even by its government; Nokia amazingly exited from all its other businesses, good and bad alike, to con centrate on a mobile phone market that was only nascent. Of course, their strategies look wonderful in hindsight. But with foresight Honda and Nokia had good reason to believe they could climb the mountains ahead. They possessed the five Ms: Money, Men, Market knowhow, technological Means, and Management control. In other words, they loaded the dice as heavily as possible in their favour. In contrast, M&amp;S lacked the Men, Market knowhow and Management control. Unfortunately, once boards become fixated on a grand ambition, they too easily convince themselves that their weaknesses are irrelevant and their strengths irresistible. But post mortem analysis usually reveals another fatal defect. Honda and Nokia started from a solid base. At M&amp;S, the business base was insecure, both in the US and, as events proved and are still proving, in the UK itself. The bridge will always be too far if the near bank affords but a wobbly foundation.
