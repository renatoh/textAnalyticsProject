Never mind format changes, or the erosion of 50-over cricket by the surging tides of Twenty20. The real issue right now is: will England's tenacious, interminable but still oddly inconclusive 50-over one-day series against Australia ever actually end? As the teams take the field at Lord's this morning for another strangely muted but still un-ignorable oddly inconclusive 50-over showdown, this feels like a point of no return. Enforced abandonment may be the only way of killing off a series that has been going on for so long it has become insidious and all-pervasive. It clings to the walls. You can taste it in your mouth in the morning, you burp it up at inopportune moments, and when you finally succeed in luring that quite nice girl from work back to your flat to admire your collection of vintage Brownie camera accessories, she starts looking pinched and talking about train times \u2013 not for reasons related to the fact that you've tucked your faded I Ran The World T-shirt unflatteringly into the waistband of your Colonial Tobacco beige polyester slacks, but because of that lingering smell of never-ending and oddly inconclusive one-day series that seems to cling to everything like mould. Recently it has become fashionable to blame \"the middle overs\", a period of deathly, dust-blown limbo where people talk interminably about the deathly dust-blown limbo of the middle overs. For England the opening overs are almost as bad. This is a part of the match that allows them to reveal their state of terminal confusion at the hands of two conflicting propositions, the need to \"get the pace of the pitch\" and to \"go aerial\", giving rise to an absolute batting stasis known as Bopara's Paradox. It's often Owais Shah who gets fingered as the real villain here, chiefly because at the crease he wears at all times the tortured facial expression of the final nonspecific bad guy gunned down in the warehouse shoot-out scene in a Mel Gibson cop movie \u2013 the one who sweats a lot and fidgets and hides behind an oil drum and eventually gets the drop on Mel, but when the gunshot comes Mel is somehow still standing and instead it's Shah who slumps to the floor because Mel's fatter/older/more ethnic partner has parked the car and come wheezing up in time to solemnly splatter him in the back of the head. This seems unfair. Watching Shah fret and gurn is at least dramatic. It also provides a respite from the dominant impression of this one-day series, a feeling of being constantly forced to watch Ryan Sidebottom bat, of being unable at any time to shut out the vision of Sidebottom waving his bat around like a tent peg mallet and looking as ever like an actor who once played one of Jamie Oliver's \"friends\" in an advert where they sit about in a fake loft apartment eating plastic sandwiches, laughing and listening to Toploader, but who's got a bit older now and the jobs have stopped coming in. For all these reasons, perhaps it really is time to abandon the current never-ending and oddly inconclusive one-day series against Australia. Although, of course this is subject to change. Should England somehow turn things around this afternoon at Lord's, we may find a new and vigorous life coursing through its inconclusive veins, tributes to its enduring never-endingness, excited chatter about the \"challenge\" of the middle overs, talk that Luke Wright doesn't in fact look like a friendly cartoon badger. Either way, we can probably expect quite a lot more of it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
