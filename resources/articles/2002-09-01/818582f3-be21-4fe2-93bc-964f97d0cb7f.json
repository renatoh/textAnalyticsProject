Members of the 'with-profits funds' that have been at the centre of insurers' investment schemes for decades must be alarmed by the waves of trouble hitting most offices. Only last week, the chief executive of AMP - owners of the shaky Pearl life office - stood down after it emerged that one of Pearl's with-profits funds is currently breaching solvency regulations. An insurance company analyst warned that more may follow. There are still concerns about the future solvency of Equitable Life which lost \u00a37 billion (a quarter of its with-profits fund) during 2001 as investors transferred to other companies in order to escape the clutches of the stricken insurer. Even the healthiest companies are looking peaky. Legal &amp; General may be one of the success stories of the last few years, but is still seeking to raise more cash to bolster its reserves. And there is speculation that Standard Life will need to underpin its financial base. An industry which aimed to protect its investors from the bumps of stock market investment has no buffer zone left itself, according to some. 'We calculated that there was excess capital of \u00a3130bn at the beginning of 2000,' says independent analyst Ned Cazalet, referring to the 'excess capital' which insurers are meant to have over and above their liabilities. 'That was down to \u00a340bn by the start of 2002. We reckon that, in aggregate, it has fallen to zero now.' Heavy falls on the stock market - bringing the FTSE-100 to six-year lows last week - are pushing most insurers to maintain daily scrutiny of their exit penalties and other crucial parts of their overall financial approach. Pearl breached solvency requirements this month when it applied a 'resilience test' to its future income figures and found that it could be heading for trouble. All insurers are obliged annually to submit statements showing their solvency posi tion to the Financial Services Authority (FSA) - and to update the FSA at other times if the various tests of solvency show possible problems ahead. Other insurers are thought to be in close discussions with the FSA. An FSA spokeswoman says: 'Given current market conditions, we are monitoring things quite closely.' It is not beyond the realms of possibility that an insurer could go bust. The obvious sick man of the industry of the last couple of years has been Equitable Life. But while Equitable was knocked over by its own misjudgments, some insurers have stumbled in response to external events - insurance claims increases after 11 September, for instance, and stock market falls. Ned Cazalet says that 'one or two may go insolvent'. Most commentators seem to believe Equitable Life has managed to stave off insolvency but Tom McPhail of Hargreaves Lansdowne says the company is still 'teetering on the edge, perhaps' - although: 'Its equity exposure is so minimal now that it has almost completely insulated itself from further stock market falls.' There are, however, some calculations which give an indication of the solvency of insurers, in the annual returns filed with the FSA and Companies House. Pearl's position was apparent in July when Money Marketing magazine and accountant KPMG analysed the returns of 39 companies, and found that, on one measure, it was the worst. It had a 'free asset ratio, excluding future profits' (see below) of -0.9 per cent. No other insurer went into negative figures. Top on this measure were NFU (14.4 per cent), Wesleyan (13.2), CIS (10.1) and Reliance Mutual (9.9). Others at the bottom were Sun Life (0.2), Equitable (0.3), Cornhill (0.4) and London Life (0.9). But, unfortunately for investors, these figures are not easy to get hold of. You can get them from Companies House, or the perhaps insurers themselves, but their real value is when they can be compared across the sector. An obvious concern is that the returns are made just once a year so are always out of date - particularly at a time of falling stock returns. Some changes could be afoot, however. Next month the FSA publishes proposals to improve its monitoring of insurers. And it is considering trying to provide more consumer information on the solvency issue. But ordinary investors will be wondering what to do. The crisis needs to be seen in context. 'If people had put their money in a tracker fund instead, they would probably have done worse than in a reasonable with-profits fund,' says Cazalet. All funds investing heavily in equities have been pushed to the limit in a market where the FTSE has almost halved since its 2000 peak. It may be worth leaving some funds: many people took the Equitable exit penalty (now 20 per cent) and transferred to other insurers in the expectation that returns would be high enough elsewhere in the long run to recoup the loss. Standard Life admits that it may introduce exit penalties on its with-profits fund. Actuary Ronnie Sloan believes Standard Life will also cut bonus rates, falling in line with many other life offices. He suspects a cut to final bonuses could have a dramatic effect on maturity payouts: 'People whose policies are due to mature next year will get less than if they cashed them in now.' Many offices are cutting bonuses. CIS announced it is chopping maturity payouts by about 5 per cent. Anyone with a likely shortfall on a mortgage should consider saving through Individual Savings Accounts or other vehicles rather than topping up their endowment. Overall, the situation is an extremely difficult and unsatisfactory one. If stock markets recover soon, the position will begin to resolve itself. If not, we are into uncharted waters.
