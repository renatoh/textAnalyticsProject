Cases of Ebola, which has killed nearly 10,000 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea during a year-long epidemic, have fallen off sharply in recent weeks. Of 99 new confirmed Ebola cases in the region during the week to 22 February, however, 63 were in Sierra Leone according to the World Health Organisation\u2019s weekly report. Sam-Sumana\u2019s bodyguard John Koroma died early this week. \u201cI have decided to be put under quarantine because I do not want to take chances and I want to lead by example,\u201d the vice-president told Reuters. \u201cI am very well and showing no signs of illness.\u201d Sam-Sumana said his entire staff will also be placed under observation and anyone showing symptoms of the disease would be tested. The vice-president is the country\u2019s first senior government figure to subject himself to a voluntary quarantine. However, officials in neighbouring Liberia, including the chief medical officer and transport minister, were placed under observation late last year. Faced with a wave of new infections, particularly in the capital Freetown and some districts in the north, the government reintroduced a number of restrictions that had been lifted earlier this year as the epidemic appeared to ease. A statement from President Ernest Bai Koroma\u2019s office late on Friday ordered public transport operators to reduce capacity by 25% to limit physical contact between passengers. The government also placed a night-time curfew on unloading goods from commercial vehicles and limited the movements of water transport."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
