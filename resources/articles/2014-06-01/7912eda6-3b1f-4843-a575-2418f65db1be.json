Greece are through. I'll type it again. What an ending! Greece are through You have to feel for Ivory Coast and Sio \u2013 who looked like someone had shot his beloved pet puppy \u2013 you really do. But Greece were the better team for large parts of that game and probably just about shade it in the end. That's all from me. Have to run and record the pod. Thanks for all your tweets, emails and opinions. Bye! He does not miss, sending the ball to the left of Barry. Heartbreak for Ivory Coast! 90+ 1 mins And it's to Greece! Lazaros breaks down the left and cuts the ball back into the box. Samaras shapes to shoot and Sio takes him down in the box. No question about that (though I have yet to see a replay). Samaras steps up ... 90 mins Ivory Coast are just three minutes away from a spot in the next round. 89 mins And another one. 86 mins Salpingidis gets behind the Ivorian defence on the right and cuts a dangerous ball across the box. There are no Greek players in the area who can turn it in but a host of Ivorian defenders sliding in almost do the job for him. That was close. 84 mins A corner to Ivory Coast. Yaya takes. He aims for the back post where it meet the head of Kalou. He knocks it back across the goal and Bamba tries to bundle it home. Glykos stop him from doing so. 82 mins Off with Gervinho, on with Sio. Elsewhere, here is how Barry celebrated that goal. 81 mins Goooooooooooooooooooal! 80 mins Prateek Chadha has been in touch. \"That goal now means that for the last fifteen minutes we will see a game of attack versus defence where the roles are reversed and the side with better attackers plays defensively and the defensively solid but attackingly inept side will attack. Should be fun.\" Oh indeed. 78 mins It's Drogba's time to trudge off and he is replaced by Diomande. 77 mins Karagounis trudges off and is replaced by Gekas. Kalou (I think, have yet to see a replay) picked the ball up in the middle of the park. Despite some pressure from the Greek defence he managed to keep hold of the ball and thread a beautiful pass to Gervinho. Inside the box on the left, he squared the ball to meet the on-rushing Bony and he swept the ball past Glykos. Super sub. 72 mins Cholevas, by the way, has been outstanding tonight both in his attacking and defensive duties. 70 mins Serey gets too handy with Cholevas and gets a yellow card for his troubles. Greece have a free-kick from about 30 yards out right in the middle of the pitch. Lazaros steps up to take it and his shot is over the bar by inches. 68 mins Kalou is wide on the left and with the ball at his feet. He slips his way past a few Greek defenders and shapes to shoot. He curls his effort just wide of the far post. Meanwhile, down the other end, Karagounis has rattled the bar from all of 30 yards out. Barry had no chance. 66 mins For the last few minutes, the game has settled into a simple patten. Ivory Coast attack in numbers, get as far as the Greek box, get frustrated and allow Greece win the ball back before going on the counter and almost score. 63 mins Before all that jazz, Bony came on for Tiote. 62 mins Greece go on the counter. Torosidis is played into space on the edge of the Ivory Coast box. He shapes to cut inside and is taken down by Kalou. He gets a yellow card and Greece get a free-kick. Karagounis can get it no further than the wall. 61 mins Just as I was pasting in that tweet, Salpingidis powered a belter of an effort at goal. Barry was equal to it though and he pushed it over the bar. 59 mins Is anyone in the least surprised by this? 57 mins On the edge of the area, Drogba and Kalou do a neat one-two. Kalou has his finger on the trigger when Manolas (I think) pulls off a goal-saving tackle. The ball goes out for a corner. They do nothing with that. 55 mins Colombia have taken the lead once more. 53 mins Yaya seems to be playing a lot more deeper now in an effort to stamp his name on the game. Meanwhile, Lazaros has nearly stamped his name in the game. He swerved his way past a few Ivorian defenders and once inside the box he aimed for goal with the outside of this boot. He missed by this much. 51 mins Down the left Ivory Coast go again. Boka tries to put one in the box but Manolas deflects it out of play for a corner. Yaya takes it but Greece pump it right out. 48 mins Ivory Coast go on the attack down the left. The ball is pulled back to Tiote on the edge of the area. He has time and space and he decides to hit it first time. He rams it right down the throat of Barry. 46 mins \"Greece with a 1-0 lead to protect?\" says Brad Wilson. \"Game, set, match. Good night, Yoyo and Didier and Barry ... with all that promise unfulfilled. Sad.\" Meanwhile, an early and decent effort from Lazaros is deflected out for a corner. That is played short and then to the back post where it is knocked off the back for Tiote for another corner. They do nowt with that. 45 mins And we are back. No subs to tell you about. That's your lot for now. Back in a few minutes. 45 mins Another goal in another game. Oh Tiote. Tiote,Tiote, Tiote. What a mistake that was. The Newcastle man was played a simple pass midway inside his own half. Maybe it was the heat, maybe he was not awarre of the Greek players around him but either way his pass to Kolo was short and easily intercepted. Samaris pounced on it and played it to Samaras. He returned the pass and once inside the box, Samaris kept his cool and put the ball over a falling Barry. You always remember your first. 41 mins Kalou has the ball at his feet and he is in the Greece box. He teases and teases Torosidis but the defender eventually forces the danger away from goal. 39 mins The game has slowed to a walking pace. Like a BBQed banana with chocolate in the middle it looks hot and sticky but still. 37 mins Drogba puts in a meaty challenge on Samaris and gets a deserved yellow card. 36 mins \"I'm with Ashdown\" chirps Matt Dony. \"The jerk in me (and, in fairness, there's a lot of him!) likes the idea of Greece going far, as they're possibly the only team I haven't heard a single person be positive about. For similar reasons, I'm sticking by Suarez. If there's a more entertaining player in world football, I'm yet to see him. Nearly, Mario. Not quite, Zlatan. Having said all that, Ivory Coast's keeper is called Barry, and that's almost worth supporting them for.\" 34 mins Finally. Something. From that last corner, Greek steamed forward. Samaras slipped Cholevas into some space in the inside channel on the right. Cholevas, at the corner of the box, then absolutely belts one at the goal that beats Barry but smashes off the post. Samaras tries to follow it in but slips on his arse. 32 mins Boka picks the ball up wide on the left. Kalou points top where he wants it in the box. The full-back tries to bend it around the Greek defence but Torosidis reads it well and puts the ball out for a corner. That comes to nothing. 30 mins Greece get a throw on the right. They work the ball back and then lash it long towards Torosidis. Boka intercepts it and Ivory Coast soon win back possession. Barcelona this ain't. 28 mins Have Greece ever taken a game to anyone? 26 mins This game has been so good that the producer/director/who ever is in charge of these TV things in Brazil is cutting to fans doing a Mexican wave and couples looking all lovey dovey. 24 mins Karnezis is cooked. He is replaced by Glykos. Greece have used two of their three subs within the first 24 minutes. 22 mins Ivory Coast go on the attack and for the first time this evening, we see Yaya do his thing. His strength and bravery see him win a 50/50 challenge just outside the box and he bounds forward. He could shoot from the edge of the area but he decides to slip in Drogba. His pass is overhit thought and Greece have a goalkick. 21 mins And here is what AS have made of that incident. 19 mins Karnezis has jumped up from his impromptu chiropractic session and is now OK. How odd that was. He went down on the ground with no one around him and it's not like he has injured himself performing any goalkeeping duties. 18 mins The game has come to a halt while Karnezis gets some work done to his back. At least there is some action over in the other game. 17 mins \"I'd half imagine that Costa Rica would quite like Greece to win,\" reckons Robin Hazlehurst. \"I'm assuming they would meet next, which could be completely wrong and would make my comment look bizarrely random if it is.\" 14 mins Down the right-hand side, a teasing ball has been poked into the Ivory Coast box by Torosidis. Barry bravely dives at the feet of Salpingidis and his sheet remains clean. 13 mins Is John the only one who wants Greece to win? 11 mins Kone is sitting down in the the middle of the pitch. It looks like he can no longer go on due to an acute case of hamstring-gah! He is replaced by Samrais. 10 mins Cholevas is back on his feet and A OK. He charges down the wing but his run is soon snuffed out and Ivory Coast go on the counter. Drogba and Gervinho combine on the right and the Roma man is set free on the inside channel. Once inside the box, he shapes to shoot but Manolas clears the ball for a corner. That comes to nothing. 7 mins Drogba has just got a bash on the head going up for a header with Cholevas. He'll be all right but Cholevas looks to be in some pain. 6 mins Greece get a free-kick midway inside the Ivory Coast half thanks to a hefty challenge from Bamba. It is launched to the back post where it meets the head of Drogba. While he was clearing the ball he got a shove in the back from Torosidis and so Ivory Coast are awarded a free-kick. Greece will have to do better with their set-pieces. 4 mins It is now Ivory Coast's turn to mimic Barcelona. Wide on the left, Tiote spins and heads for goal. He plays the ball to Kalou who quickly returns the favour. Tiote tries to cross and indeed he does but his effort beats everyone and goes out for a goalkick. 2 mins Ivory Coast start as they mean to continue, lumping the ball long to Drogba. Greece deal with the early danger easily enough and proceed to tiki-taka their way around the pitch. A strong challenge from Boka puts a stop to that. 1 min And we are off. Greece are decked in snow white and Ivory Coast are in Grinch green. Ivory Coast get us going and they start the game playing from the right to the left. Here we go then. The players stroll out onto the pitch, the stadium stands for the national anthems, the camera gets up close and personal with the players who are singing off key, hands are shook and it almost time to get and down and funky with the football. An email! Thank the Lord. \"Evening Ian,\" cheers Simon McMahon. \"Greece have been a bit toothless so far. With the knockout stage looming, I expect Ivory Coast to bare their teeth, show some bite up front and go through.\" Never mind the stats. Samaras is going to get his hair in his eyes, swing at the ball, completely miss it and knock it in with his arse in the last minute as Greece win 1-0, isn't he? In case you missed today's other big news. Anyone out there? Anyone got any predictions? Some pre-match literature for y'all. Sabri Lamouchi, the Ivory Coast coach, has spoken of the sense of responsibility his players feel after recent tragedies both personal and on a national level. Sabri Lamouchi has said Ivory Coast feel greater responsibility to reach the World Cup knockout stage for the first time in their history after the death of Oyala Ibrahim Tour\u00e9 and recent devastating landslides in the country. Tour\u00e9, brother of the internationals Kolo and Yaya, died in Manchester last week aged 28 having suffered from cancer. His brothers chose to remain at the World Cup and both could start against Greece in Fortaleza on Tuesday, when victory for the Elephants would secure their first-ever place in the last 16. Lamouchi, the Ivory Coast head coach, admitted the squad had been deeply affected by the loss of the former Nice forward and the deaths of at least 23 people in landslides that followed recent torrential rains back home. But he claimed the team will try to use the tragedies as motivation for the decisive Group C encounter. \u201cWhat happened to the brother of Kolo and Yaya is a tragedy for all of us and I would like to send our condolences to the whole Tour\u00e9 family,\u201d the French coach said on Monday. \u201cThere are also events happening in the Ivory Coast right now, a lot of flooding, and we are really concerned with the situation in our country. It is not the best situation to prepare for the match but we know with this game we can send a positive message and hopefully help the people forget about these tragedies for a while.\u201d More here. Colombia are home, dry and with their feet up watching reruns of Don't Tell the Bride. They will come top of the group should they end their game with Japan with a win or draw. Ivory Coast will be able to join them if they do one on Greece, but a draw would let Japan to take spot should they beat Colombia. Greece must take all three points and hope Japan only earn a point or less. Now in the unlikely event of an emergency Greece and Japan winning their games, they will finish level on four points and the final position will be decided on goal difference. As it currently stands, that would see Japan go through. ... Cesare Prandelli has resigned from his position as Italy manager. More on that when we have it. Ivory Coast: Barry; Boka, Kolo Tour\u00e9, Kalou, Tiote, Gervinho, Drogba, Aurier, Yaya Tour\u00e9, Serey, Bamba. Subs: Gbohouo, Sayouba, Viera, Bolly, Akpajd, Wilfried, Konan, Diomande, Gradel, Djakpa, Sio, Zokora. Greece: Karnezis; Maniatis, Manolas, Samaras, Kone, Karagounis (c), Salpingidis, Torosidis, Lazaros, Sokratis, Cholevas. Subs: Glykos, Kapino, Tzavellas, Moras, Tziolis, Mitroglou, Vyntra, Gekas, Fetfatzidis, Samaris, Tachtsidis, Katsouranis. Referee: Carlos Vera (#ECU) For some time now, Ivory Coast have been blessed with a brotherhood of exceptional ballers. Ballers who do big things for big clubs in big leagues at big times. Yaya Tour\u00e9 and Didier Drogba are two perfect examples of that. They are the type of players who have bent down, hoisted teams on their shoulders and carried them all the way to Trophiesville. They, of course, are the elder statesmen of the squad but the younger ones have of late proven themselves at club level too. To name but two, Wilfried Bony was the one bright spark in Swansea's season last year and Serge Aurier was arguably Toulouse's best player last season. It's quite odd then that the same success that the players have experienced at club level has eluded them on the international stage. It has been 22 years since they won the Africa Cup of Nations and in between that victory and this very day, they have managed to reach the final on a mere two occasions and they lost both of them on penalties. As for the World Cup, they have failed to make it out of the group stages the last two times. On neither occasion were they blessed with an easy group \u2013 in 2006 they were pulled out of the hat and placed alongside Argentina and Holland and four years later, they were forced to face Brazil and Portugal \u2013 but given the depth of their talent pool, coming third twice is sub-par placing. That lack of success is certainly not down to their abilities on the pitch \u2013 the last number of years, after all, have seen the rise of a gilded generation for Ivory Coast and as the likes of Bony and Aurier have shown the factory line shows little sign of letting up \u2013 but it is almost certainly down to mental fragility. Gervinho admitted as much before this game when he said the the side \"need to be stronger mentally.\u201d In short, when the international side get together they are bigger bottlers than a Coca Cola factory. But it has to happen for them at some stage, right? And why not now? This time around they have (on paper at least) a much easier group and far fewer excuses. Japan are pants and have already been dispatched with and as good as Colombia are, Ivory Coast impressed and were unlucky not to come away with a draw against Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman's side \u2013 Mathis Bolly should have done better with his late header and Salomon Kalou's shot right at David Ospina. All of which leaves them with just Greece to deal with. Their future is in their hands. Win and Ivory Coast are through to the last 16. Just win. Sounds easy, right? It's just Greece, right? Eh wrong. At the start of Jay Rock's song Code Red, he is asked \"What's up?\" and he replies: \"Shit, just the same old same old.\" Greece could answer that same question with that same answer. They are still tougher than leather, they are still harder to break down than Finnegans Wake and they still have fewer goals than an unambitious teenager. And Fernando Santos ain't about to apologise for that any time soon. In fact, he was rather defensive of his team and their tactics in the pre-match presser. \"After 10 years the Greek team has developed a way to play,\" he howled. \"Nobody changes their style in two or three days. We have worked for years on our style of play and there are great things about it. In the last 10 years we have won the European Championships [in 2004] and been present in the last four international competitions. We have to believe in our DNA and bring to the pitch all the qualities we have because it is these qualities that have brought us to Brazil. You don\u2019t just abandon it and start again overnight.\u201d He's right. You don\u2019t just abandon it and they won't just abandon it. As Santos says, it has worked pretty well for them so far. Many teams have failed trying to break it down. Will Ivory Coast be the latest? Or will they finally blossom at a big tournament? Stayed tuned to find out. Team news is on its way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
