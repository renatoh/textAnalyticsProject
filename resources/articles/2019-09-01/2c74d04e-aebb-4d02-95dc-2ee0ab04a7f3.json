Chelsea\u2019s transfer ban stopped them from strengthening their squad after selling Eden Hazard to Real Madrid in the summer and Lampard is taking nothing for granted after picking up five points from his first four league games. \u201cWe always want to be competitive but we\u2019re all very honest about the situation,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cEden moved on and two No 9s moved on who were the No 9s generally last season. Younger players are coming in, but we still want to be in there. \u201cBut that\u2019s not just the story because you look at teams that have invested heavily \u2013 Everton, West Ham, Leicester. There are teams that quite rightly will be competing and have ambitions to get in there, so that\u2019s challenging for all of us.\u201d Lampard, who identified Saturday\u2019s opponents, Wolves, as another threat, was asked if the Premier League\u2019s chasing pack should see Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham as vulnerable. \u201cThey should do,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause from a day when, almost the top four, you could probably write it down at the start of the season, certainly now you can\u2019t. A top six you can\u2019t write down. Teams are investing heavily. \u201cThey are well managed, they have good players, they are competitive.\u201d Chelsea, who host Valencia in the Champions League on Tuesday and Liverpool next weekend, will be without N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 because of an ankle injury when they visit Molineux.However Lampard received a boost when Callum Hudson-Odoi, who is close to agreeing a new five-year deal, and Reece James made their comebacks from long-term injuries in an Under-23s game against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on Friday night. The return of James is expected to increase the pressure on C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, who came in for heavy criticism following a poor performance in last month\u2019s 2-2 draw with Sheffield United, but Lampard was quick to mount a strong defence of the experienced right-back. \u201cI played with Azpilicueta and I know him very well and he is the first player to stand up,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason he\u2019s captain is because of that professionalism. He\u2019s been an incredible player for a club that\u2019s won a lot and he\u2019s been central to winning a lot. He\u2019s not just a bystander. \u201cHe\u2019s been right in the middle of it all and he will be more aware than anyone of his form and what it means. He will be the first one who wants to address it every minute of the day in training. I think he\u2019s a big player for us and a big personality. I see no problem.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
