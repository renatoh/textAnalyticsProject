The newly-created intercountry adoption support service will provide specialist information for parents who have started or are considering starting the notoriously complex process. They will have access to a website and a telephone help line, and will have trained staff who can help advocate on their behalf to state and international agencies. \u201cFor too long adoption has been in the too hard basket, for too long it has been too hard to adopt and for too long this has been a policy no-go zone,\u201d Abbott said in a written statement. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be that way because adoption is all about giving children a better life. For those parents who want to adopt from overseas, we will make those processes simpler to navigate, with a central contact point.\u201d Abbott said the new service would expedite intercountry adoptions. \u201cOn average, parents have to wait five years to navigate the overseas adoption process. The government believes this is not good enough and needs to be significantly improved. The new service will cut the waiting time while maintaining safeguards,\u201d the statement said. Abbott has made simplifying domestic and international adoptions a personal mission as prime minister. Shortly after winning the 2013 federal election, he announced the formation of a multi-departmental agency that would help streamline adoptions. The 2013-14 financial year saw the lowest rate of adoption since records began. Only 317 domestic and intercountry adoptions were finalised in that 12 month period. Abbott said the government is pursuing new bilateral agreements from the United States, Poland and Vietnam regarding adopting from those countries. Actress and adoption advocate Deborra-Lee Furness is one of the finalists in this year\u2019s Australian of the Year awards. The award winners will be announced in Canberra on Sunday night. Furness welcomed the announcement of the new support services. \u201cEvery step we take in reforming the process is important, and we commend the prime minister for his commitment to improving relationships with more countries and ensuring children are connected with safe homes here\u201d, Furness said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
