Ferrari's Massa, setting his third consecutive pole at his home circuit of Interlagos, is bidding to beat Hamilton to the drivers' world title in the season finale, but the McLaren driver has a seven point advantage. Even if Massa wins, Hamilton only needs to finish fifth in order to claim the championship, although with an 80 per cent chance of rain tomorrow there is the potential for a disrupted grand prix. \"There are 73 laps tomorrow which is pretty long but it's always better to start on the front,\" said Massa. \"We have a good car, we proved Friday [during practice] and this morning our car is very competitive around here and we showed also in qualifying, especially in Q3, so it's always great to be in the front. For sure I will try to do my best to win the race and that's the most important thing.\" Massa's race engineer Rob Smedley told ITV-F1 that his driver had not been light-fuelled to get to the front of the grid. \"Every now and then you see him [Massa] pull out these stunning laps and that was one. The fuel is quite normal - we even discussed whether we were too heavy.\" Hamilton said he was satisfied with his strategy for tomorrow. \"It's going to be a tough race looking after the tyres,\" he told ITV-F1. \"I'm comfortable with the fuel strategy. Obviously the guys in front are probably on a different strategy. We are in a great position to finish where we are. [Massa] needs to be [on pole] and all the best to him. I do not need to do anything spectacular.\" Jarno Trulli unexpectedly put his Toyota on the front row of the grid in the dry session - recording the team's first front-row start since the 2005 Japanese grand prix - while Kimi Raikkonen, who set the third fastest time, will line up next to Hamilton on the second row. Hamilton's team-mate Heikki Kovalainen set the fifth fastest time and will start the grand prix alongside Renault's Fernando Alonso. Massa had already set the fastest time in Q1, ahead of Kimi Raikkonen, but the pair needed several runs to achieve the times, while Hamilton was third quickest in the session after just a single run. Heikki Kovalainen set the quickest time in Q2, with Sebastien Vettel underlining his strong season with second in that session in his Toro Rosso. With Ferrari fastest in Q1 and McLaren fastest in Q2, it was a straight fight between the rival teams for the chance to start tomorrow's race from the head of the field and Massa's first run was good enough for provisional pole position, with the Brazilian improving on the time during his second flying lap. Hamilton made two errors during his first lap and his second flyer was half a second shy of Massa's best time and only good enough for fourth overall. Robert Kubica, who is battling Raikkonen for third place overall in the final drivers' standings, was knocked out in Q2 and will line up thirteenth on the grid tomorrow. In his final grand prix weekend, David Coulthard made it through into Q2 and qualified in fourteenth position. There was less luck for fellow Briton Jenson Button who stopped on the circuit after his final run and will line up in seventeenth position on the grid tomorrow. The Williams team was also under-performing, with both Nico Rosberg and Kazuki Nakajima being eliminated in the first sector, along with the pair of Force India cars.
