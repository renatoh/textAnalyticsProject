From heli golf in the Cote d'Azur to Gauguin and Van Gogh anniversary celebrations, there's plenty to choose from. And France is easier to visit too, with three new Ryanair links starting next month. Events Tour de France centenary: When the world's most gruelling cycle race started in 1903 as a publicity stunt, 60 riders travelled more than 2,500km (1,560 miles) on the basic machines of the day. With only six stages over 19 days, competitors were expected to ride through the night. This year, the tour revisits all six cities featured in the first event - Paris, Lyon, Marseilles, Toulouse, Bordeaux and Nantes. See the epic climb up Col du Galibier and Col du Telegraphe on 13 July from the alpine village of Valloire. Peak Retreats (0870 770 0408) which features lesser-known alpine villages has one week in Valloire in July in a one-bed apartment sleeping four for \u00a3449, including ferry crossing. Paris: If you need an excuse to visit Paris, the Eiffel Tower illuminations were such a success in the millennium year, they will be on again in June with a display of more than 20,000 lights to stay in place for the next 10 years. Combine a visit to see them with an exhibition of Michelangelo's drawings being shown for the first time since 1975 at the Louvre from 28 March to 23 June. Stay at the three-star Hotel Floride Etoile overlooking the tower with Cresta Holidays (0870 33 33 303) for \u00a3252 per person for three nights' B&amp;B in June with flights. The French capital is also holding its second Nuit blanche on 4 and 5 October, when its museums, libraries, monuments, places of worship, tourist sites, cinemas, parks and gardens stay open all night. Make it through to dawn and you can eat the breakfast prepared for the survivors by local shopkeepers and city halls. Eurostar Holidays Direct (0870 167 6767) has a three-night break leaving London by train on 3 October from \u00a3156 per person including B&amp;B in the two-star Hotel d'Enghien. Gauguin centenary: Paul Gauguin died in the Marquesas Islands 100 years ago, but he is inextricably linked to Brittany, where he was the focal point of a small group of artists known as the School of Pont Aven. The post-impressionist painter helped to shape the basis of modern art with his use of lush colour and two-dimensional images. The centenary of his death is being commemorated in Pont Aven with an exhibition of his work from 28 June to 29 September. Lagrange Holidays (020 7371 6111) has holiday homes at the self-catering complex in Moelan sur Mer, six miles from Pont Aven, for \u00a3146 self drive with ferry crossing for the week beginning 28 June, based on four sharing. Van Gogh anniversary: Vincent Van Gogh, whose 150th birthday anniversary is on 30 March, spent what was probably the most creative period of his life in Arles, Provence. Though he was only there for just over a year from February 1888, he produced some 300 paintings and drawings, many of them now considered his most famous works. The Rhone River quay was the setting for his Starry Night paintings. A Van Gogh Art Exhibition takes place in Arles between 23 May and 25 May. Vacances en Campagne (08700 771771) has properties two miles from Arles in former farm barns sleeping five for \u00a3615 per week, with ferry crossing or car hire included. Rouen Armada: Every four years, stunning sailing ships moor along the quayside of Rouen and are joined by 6,000 sailors for days of festivities, fireworks and music. This year, the Armada takes place from 28 June to 6 July. Visitors can tour the ships for free, take part in the mariners' mass and join in with the sea shanties. More information from www. armada.org. Stay at the Hotel Belle Isle sur Risle at Pont Audemer, a four-star manor on an island 15 miles from Rouen for \u00a388pp half board with Brittany Ferries (08705 360 360). The Portsmouth-Caen crossing costs from \u00a3130pp with car, based on two sharing. New destinations Three destinations are being added to Ryanair's (0871 246 0000) routes this spring. Pau and Reims start 30 April and Rodez 1 May. Pau: With views of snow-capped mountains from the Boulevard des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Pau is the birthplace of Henri IV. Centuries later, the English were so seduced by the climate where everything from palm trees to lemon trees grow that they moved in, establishing the continent's first golf course. Stay at Ch\u00e2teau Lamothe (0033 559 212080), 20 minutes from Pau airport in the heart of the Juan\u00e7on vine-yards, which has been converted into a three-star hotel with 10 rooms. Attic rooms, small but cosy, cost \u00a356 for two, rising to \u00a3108 for the Red Room with its four-poster bed. Breakfast is \u00a36. Reims: Caves lined with millions of champagne bottles is a pretty good lure. Follow the history of champagne making on the underground tours, from Dom Perignon, a seventeenth-century monk who mixed different grape varieties through to a widow called Clicquot (Veuve Clicquot) who developed a special table in 1816 to get rid of sediment left in the bottles. If you stock up (it's worth doing so; Mumm Cordon Rouge sells for \u00a313), remember Ryanair has a 37lb weight limit in the hold and 17lb hand luggage. Leave time to visit Reims' magnificent gothic Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame, the coronation site for 34 kings. Stay at the Mercure Cath\u00e9drale (0033 326 844949) which is central with modern rooms for \u00a365 or, if you're really celebrating, head to Les Crayeres (0033 326 828080), with just 19 rooms from \u00a3171 for two. Rodez: Not perhaps France's most obvious destination or most scenic town, Rodez is more a gateway to walking in the Aveyron and exploring the pretty hilltop villages nearby. Among them is medieval Conques on an ancient pilgrim route, and the impressive Cordes. Rodez is close to Laguiole, a small vil lage that specialises in the hand-crafted knives that are France's answer to the Swiss army knife. Watch the craftsmen, then pick a pocket knife up for about half the price it would cost in Britain. It's also only just over an hour's drive to Albi, birthplace of Toulouse Lautrec with a museum of his works next door to the impressive cathedral. French Life (08704 292188) has properties in the area, with prices from \u00a3163 for a week's self catering. Themed holidays Heli golf: Hot on the heels of heli ski a new trend is starting up in the fashionable Cote d'Azur. Golfers arrive at Nice airport and are whisked by helicopter to the Chteau de Taulane high in the hills above Grasse on the French Riviera. There's a Gary Player course surrounding the chateau, but golfers need not confine themselves to a single course; after the first day, the chopper takes them to a different one each day. Bored of golf? Then hop aboard the helicopter, which is owned by the hotel, for a trip into Monaco. The four-day trip costs \u00a31,475 per person based on four golfers sharing a helicopter, with single rooms in the chateau, half-board accommodation and flights. Sightseeing trips are extra. Call Golf Par Excellence (01737 211818). Trains: Two new train journeys are starting up this year. A luxury trip through France's South West starts at the end of April with French Rail Cruises (0033 556 006464), taking four days to travel from Bordeaux to Toulouse. The train - just two carriages - has everything from birch wood panels to a powder room fitted with a hair dryer. Stops include visits to a wine chateau of Bordeaux, the towns of Sarlat and Cordes, the Toulouse Lautrec Museum in Albi and medieval Carcassonne. All food and wine, plus overnight stays at luxury hotels, are included in the price of \u00a32,403-2,591. Ryanair (0871 246 0000) has flights to Bordeaux and Carcassonne (for Toulouse). In Provence, the narrow-gauge steam locomotives plying the breathtaking landscapes behind the French Riviera were originally fired by pine cones, giving them their name - Train des Pignes. Though they have been replaced by modern engines, the route remains the same, climbing more than 3,300 feet on a 93-mile journey through mountains and gorges from Nice to Digne. French Travel Service (08702 414243) has packaged up the journey, making it possible to jump on and off along the way, stopping at medieval towns such as Entrevaux and Annot, the lakeside town of St Andr\u00e9 les Alpes and the ancient spa town of Dignes les Bains. The cost of \u00a3469 per person includes the rail journey from London to Nice, travel on the Train des Pignes, six nights' accommodation and most meals. Phone tours : A mobile-phone tour of Lille gives you a three-minute blurb on the important sites, with information on everything from architecture to gastronomy. Tourists go to places on a map, key in the code shown on a panel to their phones and listen. Meanwhile, Paris has themed half-day tours in which participants get from place to place using clues sent by text. A ChocoSafari, for instance, takes chocoholics through tasting, a visit to a mini cocoa plantation and meetings with master chocolate makers. Tours cover everything from techno music to cigars. Until recently available in French only, Urban Safari (0033 149 520725) isrunning trips for groups of ten or more in English. Most tours are about \u00a320pp. Cycling: France's regions are fighting to outdo each other with new routes to mark the Tour de France centenary. In Cr\u00e9on, among the vines of Entre-Deux-Mers and just 20 minutes from Bordeaux, a scheme is being piloted to mark out cycle routes using the same system as ski resorts, with tracks marked from green to black according to their toughness. Starting at Cr\u00e9on's former railway station, a 35-mile stretch of disused line has been turned into a cycle route. More information from the Cr\u00e9on tourist board (0033 556 232300). In the Loire region, cyclists can pedal between ch\u00e2teaux, stopping at vineyards for refreshments with a newly-opened cycle path beside the River Vienne from Chinon to Saumur. The path is part of a long-distance route planned for the whole length of the Loire and is included in independent tours by Cycling for Softies (0161 248 8282). Holidays are tailor-made, with the most popular being the seven-night Gentle Tourer, spending two nights in each hotel, and with plenty of wine tastings. The price of \u00a3767 includes bike hire, half board accommodation and maps. French bread and breakfast: where to stay Hotels and self-catering: Everything from a g\u00eete to a chateau can be booked at www.holidayfrance.com, which has just been launched by parent company www.holiday-rentals.com. The site has more than 1,250 properties . Michelin has moved away from its legendary Red Guide to detail more than 1,000 places to stay for under \u00a380 a night for two in Charming Places to Stay (\u00a312.95). The 2003 Logis de France Guide, which lists independent family-run hotels at reasonable prices, is also available from the end of this month. Family villages: A holiday village in the Alps being developed by Intrawest is due to open its first stage this summer. Primarily a ski resort, Arc 1950 will operate year-round, with activities from mountain walks to horse riding and archery. Prices have been kept down to reflect construction disruption. Erna Low (020 7584 2841) has one week in July in a one-bed apartment for four people for a total of \u00a3701 including Dover-Calais ferry crossing. Meanwhile In June, Club Med (08453 676767) opens its first property on the Atlantic Coast, in Les Mathes on the outskirts of La Palmyre in Charente-Maritime. One week's all-inclusive stay during July at the 400-bed family village costs \u00a3795 per person, including ferry crossing. \u00b7 More information: www.holidayfrance.org.uk has links with more than 200 French holiday companies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
