In what may be regarded as mind games by the Italian, he stated that Manchester United's \"fantastic spirit\" was why City are still unable to mount a successful challenge, even though they enjoyed a 4-0 win over West Bromwich Albion on Wednesday night and included a goal from Carlos Tevez on his first start since September. With City playing on Saturday at Norwich, before United host Aston Villa the next day, the gap could be down to two points for 24 hours at least, with the prospect of Mancini's side being able to overhaul United if they were to lose again. But the manager said: \"The title race is finished because United is a fantastic team and they have a fantastic spirit. I think five points is too much. I think it is important for us to finish the season well. This is the best season for 50 years. I am proud of the players.\" Pressed why he was writing off his team's chances, Mancini said: \"Because United is a fantastic team and I don't think they can lose five points. For us, it's important we finish this season well. For us, it has been the best season since 1968, for us that's important.\" When Mancini was reminded that he had been keen to state before this match that City would never give up the title until it was mathematically impossible, he said: \"Always I will fight, every day. Also my team, but now I think it's too late. It's not mind games. United have a fantastic spirit, we don't have the same spirit. For this reason, it's very difficult.\" Mancini then claimed he had not known that United had been playing at Wigan. \"I thought they played tomorrow, I didn't know. Only when they finished the game I knew they played tonight,\" he said. \"United lost three points tonight but we lost two points to Sunderland, two to Stoke, three points to Arsenal. We lose more points in three games.\" On hearing that Wigan had defeated United, the City support remaining in the stadium cheered, believing their hopes of the title had been reignited. \"I don't know why the fans were cheering but we play for the fans. It's important we finish well. We play Norwich in another few days, it will be very tough,\" Mancini said before laughing off how a win at Carrow Road might pressure United before they play Villa. \"Yes, for 30 minutes, two hours,\" he said. Asked if he was trying to relieve the pressure from his own players, Mancini said: \"No. I spoke with my players before the game and said it's important we finish this season well because it is the best season since '68, when Manchester City won the championship.\" Mancini was also reluctant to be drawn about whether he would be surprised if City were to win and United lose at the weekend. \"I don't know. Football is really strange,\" he said. \"When you think one thing, upsets can happen. I would be surprised. For me, United are a really top team and I don't feel they can lose five points.\" United come to the Etihad Stadium on 30 April with only three games remaining in the season, yet Mancini insisted that might not prove to be crucial to the destiny of the title. \"For us it's also important to beat United here so we have beaten them two times this season.\" Of Tevez's performance on his first start for the club since 21 September, he said: \"I'm pleased with all the players. It was important to come back to play like one month ago, to score four goals. I'm happy for Carlos because he scored one but he is not ready maybe for 90 minutes [he was replaced early in the second half]. It's difficult. He scored. \"And if Carlos continues to play, he can improve his performances for us. I'm [also] happy for [Sergio] Ag\u00fcero who scored another two goals.\" Mario Balotelli missed the game because he started a three-match ban after escaping a nine-match tariff when the FA ruled they could not retrospectively issue him a red card for his high tackle on Arsenal's Alex Song in City's 1-0 defeat on Sunday. \"It's important Mario got only three games. I thought he would get six or seven games,\" Mancini said, before confirming the controversial striker will play for City again this season. \"Yes, he will be ready for Man United.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
