He was 35. The French skiing federation confirmed the news in a statement. \u201cThe federation joins the pain of his loved ones in these particularly difficult times,\u201d it said. Poisson died at the Nakiska ski resort west of Calgary, where he was preparing for the upcoming World Cup events in North America. The first event takes place this month at Alberta\u2019s Lake Louise. His best finish at a World Cup event came in 2015 when he finished third at Santa Caterina in Italy. The four-time Olympic skier Chemmy Alcott paid tribute to Poisson on Twitter. \u201cCan\u2019t believe the tragic news. A great guy who was always either charging or smiling,\u201d she wrote. Poisson was a popular figure on the ski circuit known for his broad grin, and was nicknamed \u201cCaillou\u201d (\u201csmall stone\u201d) due to his small, stocky physique. The International Ski Federation paid tribute to \u201ca respected and accomplished athlete on the World Cup tour ever since his debut in 2004\u201d. Poisson represented France at two Winter Olympics, finishing seventh in the downhill in 2010 and 16th in 2014. His death is not the first time French skiing has been hit by tragedy. World Super G champion Regine Cavagnoud was killed in a collision while training in 2001."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
