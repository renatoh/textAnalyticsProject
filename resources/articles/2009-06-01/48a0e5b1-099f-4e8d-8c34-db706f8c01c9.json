Rouget, clearly not one to shirk a challenge, turns his attentions to Royal Ascot and the centrepiece of today's card, the Prince of Wales's Stakes, with one of his recent headline winners, Never On Sunday (3.45). On trainer-form alone, this four-year-old has to be afforded the healthiest respect. Never On Sunday, however, is a progressive colt who won the Prix d'Ispahan at Longchamp last time. That was on soft ground, but faster conditions today should not worry the grey according to his jockey, Christophe Lemaire, who has been sharing in Rouget's recent success. \"He has won on good ground, so that is not a problem,\" said the rider yesterday. \"He is getting better and better. I am very keen on his chances.\" Tartan Bearer leads the home defence, deservedly so on the best of his form last season. But he is a short enough price coming here on the back of a narrow win at Sandown in April, having had to miss an intended target at The Curragh owing to heavy ground. Never On Sunday, at 9-2, makes more appeal. At similar odds, Forgotten Voice (4.20) is undeniably poor value for the Royal Hunt Cup. But Jeremy Noseda's colt could already be a lot better than a handicapper, and the icing on the cake is the booking of Johnny Murtagh plus a favourable draw. Unbeaten in three outings on Polytrack, Forgotten Voice should have no problems at all with the going on the straight Ascot mile. Noseda makes no secret of the fact that this has long been the plan for Forgotten Voice, whose entry in the Group One Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood next month shows the regard in which the colt is held. Highclere Thoroughbreds are one of the most successful syndicates in racing, and it is a tribute to the impression Rose Blossom (4.55) made on her debut at Hamilton that they wasted no time in buying a share of the Richard Fahey-trained filly after her impressive win. Fahey reckons this is the fastest two-year-old he has trained and few would argue with that. Rose Blossom left scorch marks on the Hamilton turf when winning by 4\u00bd lengths and breaking the all-age course record for five furlongs which had stood since 1972. She is the one they all have to beat in the Queen Mary Stakes. Moneycantbuymelove (5.30) drops down in distance, but she showed a good turn of foot to win a Listed race over a trip just short of 10 furlongs at Goodwood and she looks well handicapped on that form. The fourth, Splashdown, went on to win a Listed race at Newbury last week. With no obvious star in the line-up for the Jersey Stakes, Infiraad (2.30), impressive winner of a Newmarket handicap last time, may be capable of stepping up to Group Three. The 5lb which Heaven Sent (3.05) receives from Lush Lashes could swing things her way in the Windsor Forest Stakes. Horse sense Those looking to oppose Royal Hunt Cup hotpot Forgotten Voice should seriously consider Soccerjackpot (4.20) from the Clive Cox stable. Considered best when fresh, the five-year-old has been saved for this since notching a quick double on the all-weather in March. His stablemate Jimmy Styles continues to thrive ahead of Saturday's Wokingham Handicap. Jamie Osborne expects Docofthebay to go well in the Hunt Cup, in which he was a close second last year, and Drawnfromthepast is one to look out for on Friday. In an average renewal of the Jersey Stakes today, John Gosden's maiden winner Loch Linnhe cannot be ruled out. He looked sharp in his work up the Al Bahathri gallop in Newmarket on Saturday. But there is a deal of confidence behind Infiraad (2.30) in the stable of Barry Hills, right. It is an obvious pointer that Richard Hills prefers him to the same owner's Ouqba. Sir Michael Stoute's Heaven Sent (3.05) has been brought to peak fitness, but our Newmarket contact is less certain about stable companion Tartan Bearer today, preferring Henry Cecil's Twice Over (3.45), provided the ground is not too fast. We understand the confidence behind Rose Blossom (4.55) on her debut emanated from gallops clues involving the stable's smart older sprinter Utmost Respect. Rose Blossom will be hard to beat in the Queen Mary Stakes. Damaniyat Girl (5.30) is a persistent whisper for the Sandringham Handicap, with Hughie Morrison's Greenisland another to consider."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
