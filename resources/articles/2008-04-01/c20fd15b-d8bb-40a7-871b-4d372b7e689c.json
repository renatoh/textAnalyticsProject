On the eve of a critical vote over scrapping the 10p tax rate, in which Brown's leadership is at stake, TUC head Brendan Barber said the government had made a mistake. Ministers could find the money to reimburse five million low-paid earners who could lose out if they clamped down on a tax dodge used by the rich to shelter assets in their wives' names, he said. The comments come as one of the most senior members of the Cabinet, David Miliband, warned that the Prime Minister had to change his tactics if they were to win back voters. Writing in the News of the World today, the Foreign Secretary describes the party as now the 'political underdog' and says the PM has to 'see the world through the eyes of voters'. 'People will only listen to our claims about what we have done right if we are candid about what we have not,' he writes. 'Employment has never been higher, but people are worried about housing. Crime is down, but people think crime has gone up. Universal nursery education has been delivered, but more and more people are concerned about care for elderly parents.' The Labour rebellion over the abolition of the 10p tax rate and the economic downturn also appears to have affected the polls. As campaigning for crucial local elections enters its final phase, a new survey found the party's rating had slumped 3 per cent in less than a fortnight. The poll in the Sunday Mirror today gives the Tories a 10 point lead on 40 per cent, while the Lib Dems have gained two points at 19 per cent. The research, by Populus, also suggests that voters think David Cameron's team are more trusted to guide Britain through the credit crunch fallout, by 31 per cent to 29 per cent. Brendan Barber's intervention reflects growing union anger at decisions ranging from the freeze on public sector pay to a retreat over taxing wealthy non-domicile residents. It is significant, given that union support was crucial to putting Brown into Number 10 and that union money is keeping the Labour party afloat. Labour rebels are being warned that tomorrow's vote on the finance bill - which includes the 10p tax measure - is in effect a confidence vote in the government. If Brown cannot get the bill through, he could face calls to resign. Barber said that ministers had made wrong judgments on a number of issues and more must be done to lift and inspire Labour supporters. The government needed to recover its political nerve, he told The Observer. 'We have concerns that on a whole range of issues the call has been wrong, that the government has been paying too much attention to the siren voices of those campaigning for the super-rich and the corporate elite,' he said. 'They should not be intimidated by self-interested lobbies. They should have greater political confidence to set out their programme.' The government should reflect the values of 'ordinary people' and the centre ground from which British elections are traditionally won, he added: 'I remember Gordon talking about dominating the centre ground some time ago now. But the voices of the super-rich and some of the business leaders are a long way from the centre ground.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
