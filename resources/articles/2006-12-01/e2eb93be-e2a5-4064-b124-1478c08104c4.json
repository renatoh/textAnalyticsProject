Sit at one of the little aluminium tables, under the sign reminding passengers of the harsh penalties for drug traffickers, and you'll see the holiday-makers arrive. The ones on the cheaper packages - families and budget divers - wait for their holiday reps. The richer types, perma-tanned middle-aged couples and upscale honeymooners, are greeted by neatly-uniformed men who whisk them off in speedboats to islands with $3,000-a-night water villas, personal butlers, infinity pools and brochure copy peppered with phrases such as \"redefining luxury\". These are the places you read about in travel pages, usually under headlines containing the word \"paradise\". You may have noticed that you read about paradise rather a lot. There always seems to be a free trip for a writer to suffer a week of pampering in return for a few bland paragraphs. You may have also noticed what's missing from all those articles: people. The Maldives of the travel brochures is an eerie place, a culture-free series of coral dots adrift on a deep blue sea. This is no accident. Tourism here is a highly regulated activity: visitors and locals are carefully segregated. By law, resorts are located on uninhabited islands and you need written permission to stay elsewhere. Most people arrive and leave without knowing where they really are. A journey to the darker side of the Maldives begins when you take the local ferry across the water to Mal\u00e9, the capital. More than 100,000 people live on this tiny island, little more than 2km square. With 25,000 or more temporary migrants, this is one of the most densely populated places on earth. Aerial photos from the 60s show a lush green oval, bisected by a ribbon of sandy road. Now Mal\u00e9 is a concrete warren. Scooters and motorbikes clog its narrow streets, ridden by long-haired boys in surfwear and girls in tight jeans, many with the black Iranian-style headscarves newly fashionable in this increasingly religious corner of the Islamic world. Above all this is a young country. The median age is just 18. It's also a country that has, on paper at least, got rich from the tourist boom. Per capita GDP is the highest in Asia. Life expectancy, literacy and other indicators of prosperity are all up. In Mal\u00e9's shops you can buy fridges and computers and other symbols of an emergent Asian middle class. Absurdly, given that there's only one stretch of road where you can get above 20mph, there's even a custom-car subculture - boy-racers who spend more time fiddling with trim and chrome and decals than actually driving anywhere. The other thing you notice is the cops. They stand on street corners, some in the blue camouflage of the paramilitary Star Force. The police HQ, an imposing glass structure on the waterfront, stands alongside a white fortress, bristling with security cameras and manned observation posts, which houses the National Security Service. Why so much security? The crime rate here is low. It's rare even to see a beggar on the neatly-swept streets. The answer lies in the nervousness of the government of President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, Asia's longest-ruling dictator. Gayoom has ruled over this scattered chain of atolls for 28 years, controlling every branch of Maldivian public and commercial life through an elaborate system of patronage, which has ensured that the fruits of his country's economic boom have flowed disproportionately to his inner circle. His ponderously sycophantic authorised biography portrays a scholar-statesman and family man, educated in Islamic jurisprudence in Egypt, a youthful admirer of Nasser who at one time enjoyed \"a close friendship\" with Saddam Hussein. Climate-change campaigner, PG Wodehouse fan, defender of tradition and scourge of hippie nudists, he has supposedly reached father-of-the-nation status, helped by telling speeches at the UN and sweeping victories at single-candidate \"elections\". Contradict this picture and you may get more than an icy stare from Jeeves. Gayoom's political opponents routinely find themselves in jail. Amnesty International has reported a pattern of harassment, arbitrary detention, unfair trials and abuse in custody, including numerous allegations of torture and rape. While the tourists sun themselves in their virtual paradise, Maldivian society is experiencing a convulsion almost as great as the tsunami that swept across the islands in 2004. In August 2004, pro-democracy protests were violently broken up by security forces. Draconian sentences were handed down to dissidents accused (often on the flimsiest of evidence) of orchestrating violence. One activist, 32-year-old Jennifer Latheef, became the subject of an international outcry after she was sentenced to 10 years in prison for \"abetting terrorism\". The government later released Latheef (unlike several others, who remain incarcerated), but was clearly rattled. It took steps to brush up its image, hiring British public affairs consultants from Hill &amp; Knowlton, a company that has worked for many \"difficult\" national clients, notably signing a contract with China just after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Public affairs director Tim Fallon, who worked for Blair during Labour's 1997 election campaign, is seen by some Maldivians as a sinister force, giving a friendly face to an unpopular regime by promoting a clique of young, media-friendly ministers who have, perhaps inevitably, become known as the \"New Maldives\" group. In government circles he's credited with steering the elderly Gayoom away from his Middle-Eastern strongman instincts towards the path of liberal democracy. One tangible result of Hill &amp; Knowlton's consultancy is the government's sudden promise to enact a full-scale overhaul of the Maldivian political system, including judicial reform, free elections and a new constitution. Critics dismiss this as window-dressing, a way of revamping the dictatorship for the age of globalisation. Recent concessions, they say, have been won through international diplomatic pressure and the rise of the country's first organised opposition, the Maldivian Democratic Party. Formed in 2003, the MDP is led by a British-educated author called Mohammed Nasheed, known to Maldivians as \"Anni\". Since he started campaigning in the late 80s, Anni has spent five years in prison, including more than 500 days in solitary confinement. Still only 39, he's an icon to many, particularly the disaffected young. He's been accused of being a Christian missionary, a drug dealer, a terrorist and a homosexual, all serious offences in a country which denies freedom of religion and whose legal system is based on Sharia. His books are banned and he has spent time in exile in Sri Lanka. The son of a prominent family, he was sent to boarding school in Wiltshire and studied at Liverpool University. Last month he called for people from all the islands to take to their boats and gather in Mal\u00e9 for a mass demonstration on November 10, to protest the government's failure to sign the promised new constitution and to hold free elections. He vowed to fill the streets with supporters. In the run-up to the big day, I dropped into the office of Minivan (\"Independent\" in Dhivehi), a news organisation which runs a radio station, a newspaper and a website. The government sees these as mouthpieces for the opposition, which may explain why the radio station broadcasts from a transmitter in Miami and why the newspaper is produced on the office copier - no commercial printer will handle it. It's a shabby and informal place, with activist posters on the wall and a big pile of sandals in the stairwell, slipped off by staff and visitors on their way up the narrow stairs. The atmosphere is reminiscent of shoestring media operations around the world - the comings and goings, the irregular hours, the friends crashing in the spare office. I arrived at a moment of crisis. The government had banned the demonstration. There'd been a wave of arrests across the Maldives, particularly in the southern atolls, where opposition support is strongest. MDP activists were being picked up in their dozens and placed in \"preventive detention\". Boats heading for Mal\u00e9 were stopped by the coastguard. The country's best known political cartoonist, Ahmed Abbas, had been arrested and taken to the police detention island of Dhoonidhoo, accused of inciting violence. Two foreign journalists, including the first of two photographers sent by the Guardian, had been told to report to a holding facility at the airport or face deportation. By the time I left the Maldives a week later, Abbas was starting a six-month sentence for \"disobedience\" (imposed in absentia, without allowing him to present a defence) and another hundred or so people were in Dhoonidhoo, several of them on hunger strike. Despite the ban, the MDP was calling on Maldivians to march to the national legislature building, known as the People's Majlis, as the prelude to several days of protest. Police were blocking off the surrounding streets. Around the MDP office, a small group of party activists waved yellow flags, inviting a much larger crowd of onlookers to join them. Anni made an impassioned speech from a first-floor balcony. I noticed most people were keeping their distance, which might have had something to do with the line of vans drawing up and disgorging squads of riot police in body armour. Later there was a scuffle around Anni as he was surrounded by a scrum of policemen and photographers. A female MDP member, Shehenaz Abdulla, was arrested and carried into a police van. Subsequently she and others arrested that day would go on hunger strike at Dhoonidhoo, in protest at the failure to recognise the \"November 10 detainees\" as political prisoners. As the police started to clear the street with batons and pepper spray, a boy clowned around, waving a national flag. Ten minutes later I saw him, ashen-faced and unconscious, being bundled into a car. After two hours, the crowd had been dispersed. The police were maintaining a cordon around the MDP offices, and Mal\u00e9 returned to an uneasy normality. Government spokesmen played down the protests. \"If you do almost anything in the street in Mal\u00e9,\" one told me scornfully, \"you'll attract a crowd.\" Maldivians have good reason to be wary of expressing dissent. Mal\u00e9 is a town where everyone knows everyone else's business. Scurrilous gossip, denunciations, personal feuds and neighbourly surveillance are rife. In the midst of the protests, I saw police and demonstrators taunting each other by name. At night there's a constant traffic of threatening SMS messages. At all demonstrations police officers, some in plain clothes, filmed anyone who shouted slogans or became involved in any kind of confrontation. Anonymity isn't an option. For the next few days these stand-offs were to be repeated. At night, young men on scooters rode around town, looking for the action, a few carrying wooden bats or iron bars. The Maldives has a growing problem with \"brown sugar\" heroin, and addicts are sometimes used as political thugs, disrupting meetings and intimidating opposition leaders. From the MDP's point of view, things were going badly. Few boats from the islands were reaching Mal\u00e9. One wooden dhoni with 60 people on board evaded the coastguard, only to be held at bay by fast patrol vessels which sprayed them with water and allegedly made attempts to sink them. After two days the passengers and crew surrendered and were escorted to Dhoonidhoo. In Mal\u00e9 there was a weird propaganda war. Leaflets were strewn around the streets claiming the demonstrations had been cancelled. State television repeated the official line that the protestors were criminals and drug addicts and added the claim that there were mercenaries on the island. In the next few hours, a search was conducted around Mal\u00e9. Along with most other foreigners, I was stopped. Four people were deported a couple of days later. One night, I sat in a cafe with Sarah Mahir, who works for Friends of Maldives, a tiny NGO based in Salisbury. As she talked, she gloomily thumbed the reject-call key on her mobile phone. The number had been published on a pro-government website and men had been ringing all evening, at the rate of two or three a minute, to call her a whore. Friends of Maldives are vilified by the regime as Christian missionaries who, when not meddling in politics, are busy handing out crosses and smuggling pork and alcohol. I've seen a crude piece of black propaganda purporting to be a letter to Anni from David Hardingham, the group's founder. It's written on letterhead from Salisbury Cathedral, and in it \"Hardingham\" gloats about their plan to blow up the golden dome of the Islamic Centre and replace it with a place of Christian worship. David Hardingham met Anni at boarding school and his family provided a home from home for the young Maldivian. Their friendship is the cause of suspicion among Gayoom's supporters, who see Anni's cultural Englishness as evidence that he's an agent of foreign subversion. Hardingham is blacklisted and can't enter the country. While I was in Mal\u00e9 his younger brother was arrested at a restaurant and deported. Like other activists, Sarah Mahir does not think foreigners should stop visiting the Maldives. The country's lifeblood is the tourist trade and it is only now recovering from the devastation of the tsunami, which left 12,000 people homeless and caused an estimated $470 million of damage. Instead, Friends of Maldives have called for a \"selective boycott\" of around 20 resorts whose owners have close ties to the regime. The question of vested interests in the Maldives doesn't stop with resort ownership. The president's nickname (not mentioned in the official biography) is \"golhaabo\", a folk term for someone who shins up trees to steal coconuts to make toddy. Gayoom enjoys a lavish lifestyle, which includes a private island retreat and an enormous new palace. He is believed to own property in several foreign countries, including the UK. Close relatives serve in his cabinet, including two of his brothers and his brother-in-law. The rewards of service can be great. Finance minister Gasim Ibrahim, a foster child in Gayoom's wife's family, has become one of the richest man in the Maldives, with interests in shipping, fishing, oil, gas and tourism. As the days passed, it became clear that the MDP was losing the battle with the police. Though a lot of protestors were on the street, there were not the overwhelming numbers hoped for and they were disorganised. They blamed the government's campaign of intimidation, but their own lack of security meant the authorities were well-informed of their plans and able to counter them effectively. When I met Mohamed Shareef, the government's chief spokesman, he claimed that the explanation was more simple - the MDP lacked support. At 28, Shareef, known as Mundhu, is one of the rising faces of the New Maldives tendency, young men who have taken well to Hill &amp; Knowlton's media training and seem to have at least a nominal commitment to the liberal ideals set out in the new constitution. He told me the demonstrations were part of a power struggle with the MDP and that the vast majority of Maldivians supported the president. The constitution was now coming along at a cracking pace and problems such as police brutality were a thing of the past. He seemed to be having the same SMS problems as everyone else. \"You should see the messages they send me,\" he complained. \"Disgusting messages. You know what they call me? Sea slug. That's dehumanisation. Dehumanising people is the first step towards fascism.\" Both Mundhu and the foreign minister Dr Ahmed Shaheed, another of the New Maldives tendency, claim the government's record on development is good. Mal\u00e9 is undoubtedly booming, but even there the gap between rich and poor is vast. Behind the president's palace are houses where I saw migrant workers sleeping 12 to a room. And Mal\u00e9 is only one of 200 inhabited islands.As the MDP's protest collapsed, I chartered a speedboat and went to Vaavu atoll. It's only when you travel over water that you have a sense of the isolation - and the fragility - of the Maldives. We passed a few resort islands with their distinctive lines of water bungalows, then headed out into open water, shoals of flying fish skimming in our wake. It took more than two hours to reach Vaavu, one of the nearest atolls to Mal\u00e9. In the wooden dhonis used by the islanders, that journey time would multiply by four. Finally we sighted the island of Rakheedhoo, home to 364 people, of whom half work in Mal\u00e9 or at resorts. This tiny dot of land has a few streets of houses, the old ones made of coral, the new ones, rebuilt since the tsunami, from breeze blocks. There's a mosque, a football pitch, a red and white communications mast and three fishing boats. Some houses have big black plastic rainwater butts, stamped with the logo of the Red Cross. Aid money is also building a new health post, a concrete building which will replace the island's current medical facility - a chest in the island office containing bandages and paracetamol. There is little evidence of sustained government spending. I met islanders who complained that aid was being funnelled to government supporters and withheld from opponents. It was hard to tell why one house should be beautifully rebuilt and the next still a patched-up shell. I visited two other islands that day, and each time I left it was a shock to watch the green and white outcrop swallowed up by the enormous blue of sea and sky. All these islands could be gone by the end of the century: nowhere in the Maldives is more than 1m above sea level. The government is building a 2m-high artificial island next to Mal\u00e9, the national equivalent of standing on stilts. Back in Mal\u00e9 I found Anni sunk in gloom. Fearing violence, he had taken the decision to call off the protest. He was considering resignation. \"I don't think we will have a meaningful democracy here without sacrifice, without the people feeling a sense of ownership,\" he told me. \"I worry that we might have lost the only possibility for change.\" Indeed, it's easy to see one possible scenario for the Maldives where the government reform process is completed and the country nominally becomes a democracy, but almost nothing changes for the majority of Maldivians and the same few people remain in charge. Already, some state monopolies have been \"privatised\", much to the approval of the World Bank, though the money appears to be flowing into the same hands. The democracy gap and the cataclysm of the tsunami have led many towards religious fundamentalism. Salafist preachers are gaining converts in the outer islands while Middle-Eastern donors are said to be sponsoring up to two hundred Maldivian boys to attend madrassas in Pakistan. Secret talks between the government and opposition, brokered by the British High Commission in Colombo, Sri Lanka, are said to have foundered on the question of constitutional reform and demands for the removal of the hardline police chief, Adam Zahir, whose name appears in numerous personal testimonies of torture. The night the protest was called off, Zahir's Star Force made a victory round of Mal\u00e9. Wearing full body armour they toured around in their trucks, singing. It was obviously a time for score-settling. People I spoke to were targeted for harassment. I saw several young men arrested, seemingly at random. I was pulled into doorways and followed down side streets by people asking me to \"tell the international community\" about the situation. \"We want to express ourselves,\" said one man. \"See how they treat us.\" Sitting in a teahouse called the Mercury Light, I had a taste of how things must be when no one is watching. A van-load of police pulled up and started to move people off the street. Passersby called insults at them. The cafe patrons appeared resentful but resigned, as the police moved in. \"This is an opposition place,\" one man told me. \"This happens all the time.\" One man walked up and down outside, ostentatiously reading a copy of Minivan news. The police made everyone leave the Mercury Light and pushed the Guardian's (second) photographer around when she tried to take pictures. No amount of press ID or governmental business cards would persuade them to let us work. Our confrontation was drawing a crowd, some supportive, others hostile. Within a few minutes we were causing a traffic jam. We left. The next night the police returned. Witnesses described to me how an unmarked car pulled up and men wearing the blue headbands of the president's DRP party went into the tea shop and smashed fixtures with iron bars. As the MDP licked its wounds and the government savoured its victory, I went to a resort and sat on a white sand beach, watching honeymoon couples take pictures of one another. Though it was still possible to see turbulent Mal\u00e9 in the distance, my world was a peaceful place, with angel fish and orange sunsets and yoga classes on the patio before dinner. Sitting in the bar that evening I listened to the splash of reef sharks hunting in the circle of light spilling down over the water. I found myself thinking about a young man who'd been sitting outside the Mercury Light, revving his scooter and watching the arrests. He'd jutted his chin out and waved a hand, as if inviting me to enjoy the show. \"You see?\" he said, laughing cynically. \"Paradise.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
