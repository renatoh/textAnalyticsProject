Delivered two centuries ago this week, in response to plans to make the breaking of weaving machines a capital crime, it sprang from Byron's direct knowledge of the unemployed weavers' revolt in Nottinghamshire. \"Nothing but absolute want could have driven a large and once honest and industrious body of the people into the commission of excesses so hazardous to themselves, their families and their community,\" he began. \"You may call the people a mob, but do not forget that a mob too often speaks the sentiments of the people,\" he went on. \"Can you carry this bill into effect? Can you commit a whole county to their own prisons? Will you erect a gibbet in every field and hang up men like scarecrows?\" Two weeks later, Childe Harold was published and Byron awoke to find himself famous. But it is not just his poems that still ring down the ages."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
