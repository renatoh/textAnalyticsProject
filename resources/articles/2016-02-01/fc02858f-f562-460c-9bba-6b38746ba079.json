Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to check back later for a full match report. What a run of form for Juventus. They\u2019ve now kept eight straight clean sheets in all competitions, outscoring their opponents by a 17-0 margin during that span. And there\u2019s the final whistle. Juventus have stormed back from 11 points adrift on matchday 10 to one point clear of Napoli at the top of the Serie A table. The hero of the day was the substitute Simone Zaza, whose final-reel golazo made all the difference. 90 min: The fourth official calls for three minutes of stoppage time. Wow! Super sub Simone Zaza is given a bit of space and he takes everything. From the edge of the area, a moment of individual brilliance: a left-footed screamer from a tight angle that\u2019s buried in the back of the net. 86 min: Marchisio shown a yellow card for a clattering challenge. Now Sandro was come on for Dybala, Juve\u2019s final available sube 83 min: Napoli have won a set piece just outside the corner of the area, but once again it\u2019s squandered. 80 min: Ten minutes to go and this match has devolved into a defensive showcase. Hamsik has a shot on goal but there\u2019s not much to it and easily saved. 77 min: Sarri makes his first swap of the night, inserting Mertens for Insigne. 75 min: The last 10 minutes have been a bit of a slog. A tense slog. But a slog. 72 min: Roughly 20 minutes left and Maurizio Sarri has yet to make a single substitution. One must be coming soon. 69 min: Pogba nutmegged badly a moment ago. Yikes. 68 min: This, from Alex Flynn. hey bryan, it seems to me that although higuain and callejon have a great understanding, napoli lack quality in the middle. pogba has outdone both jorginho and allan, sometimes both of them at the same time 67 min: Pogba shown yellow for a foul on Callejon. 64 min: Juventus continues to apply pressure. For now it appears they\u2019re the side points to break through between now and the final whistle. 62 min: Juventus very nearly had their opener right there. Pogba traps the ball beautifully and feeds it to Dybala, who hits a thunderous shot that sails just over the crossbar. The first real chance of the match for Juve. 60 min: An hour in and both defenses have held strong. 56 min: Juventus make their second switch as Zaza comes on for Morata. 53 min: Napoli win a corner, their third of the match, but nothing comes of it. 52 min: Juventus make their first substitution of the match with Daniele Rugani entering for the injury hampered Bonucci. 50 min: Another chance for Juventus, this time from Evra, whose right-footed shot sails over the crossbar. 46 min: And were underway in the second half with no substitutions for either side. And just like that a chance for Napoli, but it\u2019s turned away by Buffon and Juve are quick on the counter-attack keyed by Pogba running with the ball up the left flank. A combined 11 shots in that first half: nine for Juve, two for Napoli. Here are a few of your observations before the second half gets underway in a few minutes\u2019 time. From Apoorv Avram: Hamsik has been a bit peripheral, no? I think the Napoli 1.0 of our times (Cavani/Lavezzi) was better suited to his play. I wonder how it feels to no longer have a squad built around you and the result being an improvement. Happy with success? Humbled by own limitations? Whatever. Hamsik seems too hardcore to care. From Ezra Finkelstein: It\u2019 makes me happy to see Cuardado,the former Chelsea flop under Mourinho,open a new phase of his career alongside another big Premier league outcast,Paul Pogba.He\u2019s sure to teach him a few tricks. And if you thought Balotellis\u2019s haircuts were strange.Check out Pogba\u2019s nostalgic brain fade. And Aman Gupta: Referee Daniele Orsato blows the whistle and the teams will decamp to their locker rooms deadlocked at zero. 45 min: Fourth official rules for one minute of stoppage time. 43 min: Reina corrals an off-target shot near the goal line and the linesman rules it a corner kick, even though replays confirm the keeper picked up the ball before it had rolled completely over the line. Nothing comes of the set piece but Reina and the Napoli field players are rightly furious. 42 min: Pogba has another go on goal, this time missing near post. Juventus clearly taking the match to Napoli, who seem content to sit back and wait for the counter-attack. 38 min: Another ball sent into Higuain, who makes the exact same run he made minutes earlier into the middle of the area, but he can\u2019t quite connect with it and it\u2019s out for a goal kick. Someone had better keep an eye on him. 34 min: Higuain makes a run for the back post where the ball is perfectly served in to him ... and Bonucci comes out of nowhere to boot it out with his right leg! An incredible defensive play on what looks to be a certain Napoli goal. Now the visitors will have a corner. 32 min: Here\u2019s a prediction from John McEnerney, via Twitter. 30 min: Pogba, given a little space, thuds a right-footed shot from outside the area that sails wide right of the target. It missed the mark, but the pace of that attempt will likely remind Napoli\u2019s defenders to not cede the young Frenchman so much real estate. 29 min: Juventus win another corner when a Dybala cross caroms out off a defender, but it\u2019s cleared toward midfield. 26 min: A few set pieces for Juventus but no meaningful chances for either side. So far an carefree day for Reina and Buffon. 23 min: Napoli\u2019s Allan is hacked down near midfield by Pogba and wins a foul. It\u2019s booted way down into the area but Juventus has no problem clearing it. The stalemate continues. 22 min: Another free-kick chance for Juventus about 20 yards from the goal. Dybala drives it into the center of the area but it\u2019s ultimately cleared. A note from JR in Illinois, via email: Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on your point of view) Ray Hudson\u2019s announcing duties on the BeIN sports channel seem to be limited to La Liga games only. Matteo Bonetti, who is one of this game\u2019s announcers, is clearly trying to steal a page from old Ray\u2019s book, for he has just said the following: \u201cJuan Cuadrado is the embodiment of a double espresso shot.\u201d As the kids say these days: fail. 19 min: Juve win a free kick. Pogba to take it, but his attempt sails wide right of the target. 18 min: Play has resumed but it\u2019s unclear whether Bonucci will be continuing. He was gripping his knee as he came off. 15 min: Napoli pressuring now, Insigne dribbling into the area. But Bonucci is down and the referee has stopped play. Napoli players furious because Bonucci actually clattered into his own team-mate. 12 min: A confirmation from Richard from Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, via email: Yes, that indeed is a Pokeball shaved into Pogba\u2019s head. 10 min: Dybala uncorks a shot attempt but it\u2019s blocked. Moments later Juventus win a corner, Cuadrado to take it, but it\u2019s easily cleared by Napoli. 7 min: Juve have worked the ball down into the final third on a long through ball to Cuadrado, who swings it back to Pogba, but he\u2019s run out and possession goes back to the visitors. 5 min: No substantial chances for either side in the opening five minutes but lots of back and forth action. Does Paul Pogba have a Pokeball on his head? 3 min: The corner is low into the area and immediately headed clear. 2 min: Napoli win an early corner. Electric atmosphere here. 1 min: And we\u2019re off! Juventus attacking from left to right in their familiar home strips, Napoli from right to left wearing their third kit: red shirts, blue shorts, red socks. Juve immediately play it back to try and build up from the rear but Napoli showing immediate high pressure and a desire to push the hosts back into their half of the pitch. The Juventus fans are singing club anthem Storia Di Un Grande Amore as the players emerge from the tunnel. Not much longer now. Can Juventus stop Gonzalo Higua\u00edn? The Napoli striker is on a goal-scoring tear with 24 in 24 games. (By comparison Juve\u2019s entire striking force has scored 25.) Yet the Argentine will be going against a stingy defense that\u2019s kept seven clean sheets in a row, conceding only eight goals in their last 20 matches across all competitions. Here are a look at today\u2019s teams. Kickoff is just about 10 minutes away. Juventus XI: Buffon; Lichtsteiner, Bonucci, Barzagli, Evra; Khedira, Marchisio, Pogba; Cuadrado, Dybala, Mandzukic Bench: Neto, Rubinho, Rugani, Romagna, Alex Sandro, Padoin, Sturaro, Hernanes, Pereyra, Zaza, Favilli Napoli XI: Reina; Hysaj, Albiol, Koulibaly, Ghoulam; Allan, Jorginho, Hamsik; Callejon, Higuain, Insigne Bench: Gabriel, Rafael; Chiriches, Regini, Maggio, Chalobah, Lopez, Valdifiori, El Kaddouri, Mertens, Gabbiadini Hello and welcome to today\u2019s crucial top-two matchup between Juventus and Napoli in Turin. Could this be a Serie A title decider? It sure would seem so. Napoli are top of the table with 56 points with Juve only two points adrift and seven clear of third-place Roma. Both sides are on outstanding runs of form. Juventus have won 14 consecutive matches in the league and 12 straight in all competitions, with Napoli having lost only twice since August. Plenty more to come. We\u2019ll be back shortly with the team information. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime why not check out Nick Ames\u2019 preview of today\u2019s match. Maurizio Sarri is not always too fussed about watching his words but there was something about one of his pre-match sentences, uttered the day before a fixture that has flung Serie A to the forefront of this weekend\u2019s affairs, that teed up the occasion perfectly. \u201cWe\u2019re mad enough to go to Turin and impose our game on them,\u201d said the Napoli manager of his team\u2019s visit to Juventus and to the outsider there is certainly something wild, raw and compelling about the thought of a first Neapolitan charge to the title since 1990. The madness Sarri endorses can be used to characterise his city of employment but more pertinently it has channeled itself to create a scenario that seemed unthinkable six months ago: Napoli will move five points clear at the summit if they defeat second-placed Juventus in Turin on Saturday night, and Italy\u2019s top division will continue to revel in a race for honours that has been a timely shot in the arm. It is a clash of two objects that, in their different ways, have become near-impossible to withstand. A reshaped Juventus began their defence of a title that, for a second consecutive year, was won by 17 clear points in uncharacteristically sluggish fashion and it has taken a run of form unprecedented in either of those seasons to propel them into serious contention. A club record 14 consecutive Serie A wins \u2013 and five clean sheets in a row \u2013 is the current count and the sleekness they have eased back into gives Massimiliano Allegri\u2019s assertion that \u201cserenity\u201d will be key to success against Napoli an ominous ring to those in opposition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
