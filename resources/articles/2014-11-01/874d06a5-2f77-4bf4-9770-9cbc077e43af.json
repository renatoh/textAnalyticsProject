The Dutchman accepts that the diminutive stature of many of his players is one of the reasons his side has yet to win away from home this season, but is adamant the answer does not lie in the transfer market. United conceded last week when Rafael da Silva ended up marking Chelsea\u2019s Didier Drogba, who is five inches taller than him, at a corner, and they encounter another sizeable side in \u2019s Manchester derby. Vincent Kompany, Eliaquim Mangala, Yaya Tour\u00e9 and Edin Dzeko are all at least 6ft 2in, and could give Manchester City a similar aerial supremacy. Van Gaal said: \u201cWe have it very difficult in set plays but that is because of the height of our team. Maybe you can advise me then to buy tall players, but I am not like that.\u201d He studied the statistics as he shrugged off City\u2019s height advantage, saying: \u201cThey scored only once from a set play [this season]. We did more.\u201d United have conceded seven goals in their past two away games, while CSKA Moscow, West Ham and Newcastle have all scored twice against City in the past fortnight \u2013 meaning both defences have been criticised. Manuel Pellegrini accepts United have had difficulties at the back and he City manager said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll continue to be weak at defending or continue to be strong in attacking.\u201d The United centre-back Marcos Rojo admitted that the back four can be exposed by their expansive game, arguing a commitment to attack is vital. \u201cWe go out to win every match, as is our duty at United,\u201d he said. \u201cThat does imply a certain amount of risk-taking: you have to play high up and take your chances. We accept that the team has to play high, but we set out to win and that is what we\u2019ll be doing.\u201d Rojo, a \u00a316m signing from Sporting Lisbon in August, will be charged with stopping his fellow countryman Sergio Ag\u00fcero. The United defender and the City striker were team-mates as Argentina reached the World Cup final this summer but have never lined up in opposition before. Ag\u00fcero struck four times in his last league game at the Etihad Stadium, against Tottenham, and has the best goals-per-minute ratio in Premier League history. Rojo warned the City top scorer to expect the close attentions of the United defence in a physical contest. \u201cHe is one of the top players in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can be overcome, but it will take a great effort. You have to stick close to him and be very attentive. Certainly, in the penalty area, he is a very quick mover and gets into position very quickly. He can be controlled, but it is up to us to keep an eye on where he is at all times, and get into him with a degree of firmness. \u201cIt will be a hard game, and you have to play in a hard way. I don\u2019t mean go crunching in, but a tough way. You have to play with close marking and strong tackles.\u201d Rojo joked that Ag\u00fcero was scared when the City striker missed a promotional event involving both, but vowed to put their friendship aside for 90 minutes. He explained: \u201cYou might exchange the odd word during the game but generally with opponents, you tend to forget if it is a friend or compatriot. He\u2019s City. We\u2019re United. And that\u2019s it. You put all that behind you; you go out there for the team, and winning is everything.\u201d The 24-year-old was the sole centre-back signed during a summer when United lost Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, their long-term partnership, and the Argentinian came to Van Gaal\u2019s attention as a left-back in the World Cup. \u201cThe coach certainly knows that I\u2019m very happy to play in both positions \u2013 I can play left or central,\u201d Rojo said. \u201cAt the moment I am playing more centrally, but I\u2019ll happily play on the left.\u201d City have emerged victorious in five of the past six league derbies, but Rojo countered: \u201cHistorically, you have to say United have been superior.\u201d First-team players from both Manchester clubs were on hand to take part in a Premier League kicks session between City in the Community and the Manchester United Foundation"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
