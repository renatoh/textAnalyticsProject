In the minds of well-off male politicians of the post-war era, it was a straightforward sneer. \"Nanny\" was a bossy, female authoritarian figure they half-remembered telling them to drink their castor oil and wash behind their ears before bedtime. The tens of millions of people for whom state intervention was most needed would have never come across \"nanny\" in their lives, except perhaps as \"nan\", as in granny. As for the millions who came across them only through popular culture, nannies were mostly a benign fantasy - sweet-voiced Julie Andrews sweeping in with a dose of sugary medicine and a sparkle of magic. Today, apart from the tiny clique of Americans and Sloane rangers who can afford a Norlands gal, if \"nanny\" conjures up anything, it is a keen, confused, homesick teenager from Bratislava. Despite all this, the cobwebbed phrase has stuck with rightwing politicians and commentators. Like the 1922 committee and whipping, it is political jargon that has long outlived its origins. Unlike them, it is loaded and always hostile. The target is government meddling and interference in private lives. And it is interesting that meddling is given a female form. The nanny state wears skirts. This is a time of year and a moment in politics when the issue of ministerial lectures is particularly timely. It's hangover time. It's new year resolution time; and, boy, do the ministers have resolutions for you. As the nation groans its way back into work clothes, staring aghast at the extra rolling pounds our Christmas binge has put on, ministers such as Tessa Jowell are campaigning hard against the impact of the food industry on children's diets. Hardly a day passes without new government-approved warnings on cholesterol, stress, sleep, sugar and exercise. New laws on using mobile phones while driving have come in. Ministers look on approvingly as the British Medical Association raises the question of whether there should be a general ban on smoking. There's been a \"salt summit\" on the use of coronary-threatening quantities of salt in processed foods. This is also a time of year when rocketing credit card debt has become a big public issue, and yet offers to borrow more money drop through the letterbox daily. As Britain's overweight, indebted families look blearily ahead into 2004, the government is on hand to teach them family values too. A raft of new measures aimed at the parents of anti-social children is now available to the police and courts. Only yesterday another female minister, Margaret Hodge, was being hammered in the papers for approving funds for Parentline Plus, an email advice service for parents. The children's minister argued that good parenting could boost children's performance at school by more than 10% and that \"the festive season often highlights family problems and stresses\". Hodge's crime, according to her critics? \"Nanny-state meddling ... increasing interference by the state in people's everyday affairs.\" It is time to stand up for the \"nanny state\" - for Jowell and Hodge and, in other areas, Patricia Hewitt and Harriet Harman. And also, in general, for the state's right and duty to involve itself in questions of diet, health, family budgets and good parenting. The crucial point which critics of the nanny state fail to mention is that individuals and families don't stand alone. None of us lives in a neutral social space, unharassed, and free to make wise long-term choices. Whatever the philosophical ideal, in the real world we are bombarded by corporate messages cajoling us and our children to consume and borrow. We are inhabitants of the more, now, spend-it, eat-it society, which - let us not forget - boosts the profits of the multinationals. Whether we like this way of life or not, the consequences are clear. America and Europe face an obesity epidemic which may shorten the lives of today's children by 10 years, as compared to their parents. Working parents and the decline of the extended family have eroded parenting skills - fact. The torrent of borrow-now propaganda from banks, unthinkable a generation ago, has resulted in a much more indebted society - fact. But this is only half the story. Affluent families have more freedom to deal with the consequences. They buy the fresh food which isn't loaded with sugar and salt. They buy mounds of expensive fruit for their children. They paysubscriptions for gyms and health clubs, and go on pricey diets. They are better-educated about health issues and they buy the parenting books. They can respond to the latest \"must-have\" (always a lie) advertising for electronic goodies without falling into crippling debt. Oh yes, and they can buy indomestic help - nannies and their successors. Just as in urban America, it is the poorer British who are most visibly damaged by the downside of consumerism. This is pretty simple. If you can't afford the expensive consolations of winter travel or dinners out, then the homelier treats of chocolate, burgers and alcopops are that much harder to resist. Fat now means poor. Pop Idol's 15-stone Michelle is a working-class girl who stands, and wobbles, for millions. Pass a group of kids smoking and the odds are they will be female and poor. And if poorer families fall down on the parenting front, they can't buy in foreign girls to help plug the gaps. Who really thinks that a centre-left government should stand aside and do nothing? The whole point of progressive politics is to stand with the most vulnerable people. Today that means helping counter the great commercial, short-termist forces that rain down. Nanny state? Once upon a time, nannies were the carers and the copers for middle-class families whose parents had opted out. Today, in trying to help all families struggle with consequences of consumerism and social change, these ministers are doing a vital and noble job. It's time their friends on the left gave them some support. jackie.ashley@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
