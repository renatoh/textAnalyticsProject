The new \u00a35.99-a-month service, which will also offer shows from Channel 4 and Channel 5, is aiming to compete with Netflix and Amazon Prime Video by positioning itself as the home of the widest library of British shows, old and new. However, bosses have said a range of classic shows, such as the BBC\u2019s Till Death Us Do Part and ITV\u2019s Love Thy Neighbour, will not appear on the service because of content deemed racist or otherwise unacceptable. \u201c[BritBox] is a selection [of shows],\u201d said Reemah Sakaan, the senior ITV executive responsible for launching the subscription video-on-demand service. \u201cWe also recomply everything that goes on to BritBox [with modern TV viewing standards]. There\u2019s also the ability to create bespoke warnings around key programming.\u201d Sakaan confirmed that Till Death Us Do Part, featuring the bigoted character Alf Garnett, which first aired on BBC1 in 1965, and ITV\u2019s 1970s series Love Thy Neighbour, a sitcom about a West Indian couple who move next door to a white English couple, will not appear on the service. It Ain\u2019t Half Hot Mum, the BBC comedy about a military band in India during the second world war, will also be absent. There are numerous individual episodes of some beloved shows that will appear on BritBox \u2013 including the BBC\u2019s Only Fools and Horses and Fawlty Towers \u2013 which could be deemed inappropriate for modern viewing. However, it is understood that no Fawlty Towers episodes will be cut from the service, although they will run with warnings about offensive language. \u201cWe\u2019ve carefully selected a wide range of the very best in British programming which will appeal to viewers in 2019,\u201d an ITV spokeswoman said. ITV\u2019s compliance team is voluntarily vetting BritBox shows to make sure they adhere to the broadcasting code, which applies to the broadcaster\u2019s TV channels and is governed by Ofcom, the media and communications watchdog. The broadcasting code includes strict rules relating to harm and offence and generally accepted standards, including inappropriate, explicit and violent content. However, BritBox is officially subject to a much less stringent set of rules than those of traditional TV channels such as ITV and the BBC. BritBox offers a range of shows, from Downton Abbey, Gavin &amp; Stacey and Wolf Hall to Broadchurch, Brideshead Revisited, Blackadder and more than 600 episodes of Doctor Who. Channel 4 will add more than 1,000 hours of its TV and film content to the service in the spring but it is not clear whether its biggest hit, The Great British Bake Off, will be available, as the show\u2019s producers have a separate streaming deal with Netflix. \u201cWe are making our [show] selections with Channel 4 as we speak and that is the kind of show that is top of our list,\u201d Sakaan said. BritBox is a late arrival in an increasingly crowded streaming market. Earlier this month Apple launched its new streaming service, undercutting all rivals at just \u00a34.99 a month, or free for a year to buyers of new Apple devices. Netflix is the most popular subscription streamer in the UK, having 11 million subscribers, but it is becoming increasingly expensive, with its most popular package priced at \u00a38.99 a month. Prime Video is estimated to have 8.6 million UK subscribers, with Sky\u2019s Now TV the third most popular service with about 1.75 million. Sakaan took a swipe at Netflix, which has rung up debt and liabilities of more than $30bn (\u00a323bn) in the process of building the world\u2019s largest streaming service with more than 150m subscribers. \u201cFor the first time all the UK\u2019s public service broadcasters have joined forces to take part in the fast-paced streaming market,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got ambitious plans for BritBox. We are realistic and confident about establishing a scale business and, unlike some of these [streaming] ventures, we intend for this to be profitable.\u201d She said there was a gap in the market because UK audiences often felt \u201clost\u201d using other streaming services dominated by US content. \u201cIn BritBox you are immediately in a world populated by people and faces and places you know. The scale of British content available eclipses what is on any other streaming service.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
