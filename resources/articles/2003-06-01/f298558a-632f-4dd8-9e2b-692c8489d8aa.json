On his mostly shaven head was what looked like a small, black skullcap with a nine-inch feather sticking up from its centre, but which on closer inspection turned out to be part of his hairstyle. In itself unremarkable in these aesthetically random times, but his air of general dissatisfaction struck a dissonant chord in my soul. I'd been grappling with a feeling of dissatisfaction of my own as I drove along, noticing how it was unrelated to external conditions, for I had, at that moment, no cause for anything but relative peace within. Yet internal friction was clearly palpable. Granted I'd not been long off a 12-hour flight and hadn't fully landed yet, itself significant as you'll see, but there was no actual reason to feel disgruntled with life. Dissatisfaction is intrinsic to the human condition. Indeed, it is the major driving force of progress. However, in light of rapidly dwindling resources, it's obvious we have to address the issue and learn to assuage our hunger for more, more, more (money, houses, food, sex, experiences, travel, etc) in different ways. As it happens, those wily old Taoists may just have the solution. As I've often said, every possible mind-state correlates to an energetic balance or imbalance in one or more of your five vital organs - kidneys, liver, heart, spleen and lungs - and that whether that mind-state is triggered by external events or by weakness in the relevant organ, it can be adjusted by rebalancing the energy in that organ. In the case of dissatisfaction, it's your spleen energy that needs attending to. Though in Western thought the spleen is fairly underrated, in the Taoist scheme, it's responsible for, among other things, your entire digestive system, including regulating body weight by letting your mind know when you've eaten enough. It does this by signalling satisfaction as soon as you reach optimum levels of food intake. If it happens to be weak and its energy deficient, it will require no end of shovelling food in your mouth to reach that point. When severely weakened, you never reach that point and are prone to obesity. But food is not just the stuff you eat, it's also the information you constantly take in and process, as in the food of life, which according to the Taoists is also under control of your spleen. So when weak, no matter how grand your external conditions may be, no matter how little there may actually be to complain about, you feel dissatisfied. At this point, the normal reaction is to try and work out what's bothering you and attempt to resolve it intellectually, which as you know often just ties you in knots. The Taoist way, though, is to adjust the energy in your spleen and allow the dissatisfaction to evaporate, without analysing the practical or psychological factors involved. This isn't a cop-out, for as soon as your energy normalises and your natural contentment returns, the practical and psychological reasons for the discontent reveal themselves and can be addressed in a calm, orderly and energy-efficient way. Each of the five organs, incidentally, is related to one of the five elements - water, wood, fire, earth and metal, respectively - the spleen being related to earth, which explains my own attack. Any time you leave the ground, to fly in a metal tube through the sky, your spleen energy becomes dislodged, and obviously the longer you're up there the stronger the effect. To remedy the situation energetically, should you be suffering a dissatisfaction attack you wish to resolve in a hurry, massage with gusto in the instep of each foot, firmly circling your thumb, just behind the edge of the ball of the foot, completing 36 circles on each foot. Now placing your palm over your lower left-hand ribs, resonantly chant the Taoist spleen-healing sound, 'huuuu!' and feel it vibrating through the organ. Finally declare, 'Dissatisfaction be gone and let the good times roll!' Feeling better? Maybe I should change my name to Dr Huuu."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
