A father in his early 40s, a mother in her mid-30s, and two daughters and a son, all aged under 10, died when the fire took hold at their home in Hayes, west London on Saturday morning. The bodies had not been formally identified last night and efforts were still being made to trace next of kin. Firefighters were called to the house just before 3am and spent nearly two hours battling the flames. Mazin Daod, a fire service spokesman, said: \"At this stage, it is difficult to tell how the fire started because of the level of destruction, but we are looking into every possibility. At this time of year candles and lights are brought down from the loft and dusted off, and Christmas trees can be a real hazard.\" Neighbours said the parents moved to Britain from Mauritius before starting a family together. A Scotland Yard spokesman said officers found two adults and a child downstairs and two other children upstairs, but by the time they arrived nothing could be done for them. He added: \"Especially when you come across children in such cases, it is hard.\" A neighbour, Isabel Kiflie, 31, said she had tried to use a kitchen hose to put the flames out, but they were too fierce for it to have any effect. She added: \"The children were just so lovely. They came over last Sunday to see my new baby and the nine-year-old was so excited because she wanted to spend Christmas with my baby. \"The little boy used to come and play with my son. They were very friendly people and would always say hello. It is just awful.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
