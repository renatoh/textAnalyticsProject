Ronaldo is to miss United's next three matches, starting with Sunday's derby at Manchester City, and Ferguson intends to impose a mandatory club fine. Under PFA guidelines, the maximum is two weeks' wages, which means Ronaldo could be docked around \u00a3230,000. Ferguson believes Ronaldo was \"provoked\" but was incensed by the player's rash response."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
