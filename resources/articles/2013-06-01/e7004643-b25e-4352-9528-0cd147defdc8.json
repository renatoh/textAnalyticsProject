The San Antonio Spurs who will get to rest as the Miami Heat and Indiana Pacers wear each other out, and if this game is any indication, they very much will wear each other out. All of us who are not Heat fans, because we get a Game 7 and those are always awesome and an underdog story, which we all love. Tonight's losers: The Miami Heat (again obviously) who seem tired and look actually vulnerable right now for the first time in these playoffs, and have to look forward to a difficult NBA Finals matchup if they make it that far. David Stern, the NBA and the networks who now have to pray for a Game 7 Miami win or otherwise prepare themselves for the ratings disaster that would be a Pacers/Spurs Finals. Our personal lives: Because we will be back on Monday night to liveblog Heat/Pacers Game 7 here at the Guardian. Thanks to everyone for following along with us tonight, especially all those who contributed, hopefully we'll see you again Monday. Until then, Ciao! The Indiana Pacers win! The Pacers and Heat will be returning to American Airlines Arena on Monday for an improbable Game 7! I cannot believe there's going to be a Game 7. While Chalmers takes his free throws to make the final score a bit more respectable, Indiana takes out Paul George and Roy Hibbert to much deserved applause. And we're done here. LeBron James makes a layup, but the Pacers respond with a three-pointer from Paul George. James and Wade go off the floor as Bosh takes his free throws. George Hill makes a fadeaway shot and it might just be time management here for the Pacers. I think David West is feeling better. He makes a jumper here to extend the Indiana lead. Wade blocks a Hill shot, the Pacers scramble to get it back but it's a 24-second violation. Heat ball. Hibbert tries to block LeBron on the other end, but James gets the call. James makes only one of two and it's now Indiana's ball. Oh hey the Red Sox and Bruins just won, so maybe now my Boston friends will jump in here to catch the end of the game. I have a feeling most of them will be rooting against Miami. Just a hunch. Maybe LeBron's technical foul was sort of a payback for the flopping this series? The refs never do like being fooled. I hate that we're talking about the officiating again. Roy Hibbert makes a layup and the Heat take a timeout. They're going to need to do some work here to avoid a Game 7. George Hill picks up a foul, and then on the other side... Hibbert takes a charge from LeBron James. James picks up a foul AND a technical foul, plus Miami's assistant coach gets a technical foul. I guess it's calling him on showing up an official? This seems cheap. Hill cashes in both free throws. West wrestles the ball away from Mike Miller to get his own rebound and puts it in for Indiana. Much needed play. Lordy. This is going to be a finish isn't it? Oh lord did Indiana need that three-pointer from Paul George. Joel Anthony is on the receiving end of a foul call and that takes us to an official timeout with the Pacers a tad more beat up but still ahead. And Hibbert is back here. It doesn't help, as Miller gets a steal and gets it to LeBron James. Maybe Frank Vogel should call a timeout here? David West has found his shot again, unfortunately the Pacers can't defend LeBron James on the other end and he makes a shot. Roy Hibbert is on the bench, by the way. And Aram's prophecy comes true, as Mike Miller hits two straight three-pointers here and this is most definitely a game again. The Pacers needed to come out strong here, I think, instead they've let Miami chip into the lead. David West gets the ball out of the timeout and quickly makes his second field goal of the game. Simmons, is that you? Ray Allen misses two straight shots after missing one of two field goals which is still surprising to me. I keep thinking of the Ray Allen of 2009 and not this older version. Indiana calls a time out here while I start thinking about mortality again. Miller is due to have one of his crazy three-pointer performances here... Ray Allen gets the benefit of a foul call on the other end. Miami are playing very physical to come out of the fourth. Allen makes one of two. Mike Miller is in the game, and immediately gets called for traveling. Then Ray Allen gets called for a foul on Paul George. Yikes. Still, the Pacers can't do anything on their first possession, but surprisingly neither can LeBron on the other end. He then runs into George on the other end and gets the foul on him. A very smart play, and another chance to get Miami closer. He makes both. Well usually it's the Heat who come out and make the adjustments in the third quarter, but this time around the Pacers emerged with guns blazing. However, they really could not have played those last few seconds any worse. Let's see if Miami can build on that. Or what he just said sums it up better. Wade, trying to keep his team in this game, makes a jumper but, as seems to be happening a lot during this third quarter, Indiana responds, in this case, Hill gets the ball to Hibbert for a layup. And now, finally, LeBron James makes his first appearance at the free throw line. He hits both. THEN, with less than a second remaining, David West makes a baaad throw picked up by James who gets fouled on the way to the basket. He might not have had time to get the shot off, but he has plenty of time to get free throws. Just a terrible play by the Pacers. He makes both to end the third quarter. Wade gets to the line, makes one of two free throws. Okay this may not be Miami's night as D.J. Augustine actually scores here. Cole picks up a foul, giving Miami the ball and LeBron James, remember that guy, makes a two-point jumper but Paul George responds with a layup. Lance Stephenson commits another turnover, but Miami can't do anything with the ball again. I've never seen this offense this confused. Tyler Hansbrough has a shot but tries to get it to Hibbert and they take too long, turning it over on a 24 second violation. This is a key moment that Miami has to score... but instead Wade misses a layup. Hansbrough then tips in a missed Hibbert shot and the lead is now 16 points. Finally something good happens for Miami, Wade makes an interception on George and draws a foul on Roy Hibbert. Wade makes it to the free throw line but only makes one of two free throws. Paul George's shot is blocked, but Chris Bosh is called for goaltending and this is getting ugly. Then George picks off a Miami ball, and the Heat look almost lost. LeBron James picks up only his first foul of the game, but they're adding up for his team. Paul George gets off the floor and makes both of his free throws. Dwyane Wade comes out of timeout and hits a three, everyone involved on Miami's side needed that one. But Paul George immediately answers with a three of his own. That would make 20 points for Hibbert who has joined the ranks of that German dude who plays for Dallas as far as Heat killers. A cryptic email from Eason just says \"Not a decent game\". At the moment, Pacers fans would say otherwise. Haslem steps out with the ball and turns it over, and then picks up a foul on the other side. I guess he's not going to have one of his great games, the Heat bring in Joel Anthony but nobody is stopping Roy Hibbert right now as he hits another shot and the Heat call another timeout Roy Hibbert gets to the line as Haslem picks up his third foul. He hits the first and misses the second, but the Pacers pick up the defensive rebound and Hibbert get the ball back from West who lays one in to extend the Pacers lead. It's time for the Heat to miss two easy layups, this time Wade and Chalmers. Paul George then gets charged with a foul when LeBron James does a bit of... ahem, acting. He should be banned from the league for aesthetic reasons alone, without even factoring in his dirty play on-the-court and his questionable off-the-court reputation. David West still exists! He hits a jumper to extend the lead and you know that you've been on a cold streak when the other team calls a timeout when you finally make a shot as Miami does here. And then George \"Running Up The Score\" Hill does his thing by making a three-point shot and then getting a rebound off a Wade miss for a two-point shot. Stephenson's shot is wiped away as Haslem takes a charge, turnover gives it back to the Heat. Roy Hibbert instead gets the first points for the Pacers with a layup, and Miami responds to keep the one-point lead. I have no idea why I was compelled to seek out the Sports Guy's thoughts about tonight's game but here we go. Sigh... He's like the Sancho Panza of NBA writers in his quest for someone to make him a GM. Can someone give this man a NBA team just so we can see how hilariously disastrous it would be? Come on, Michael Jordan: Bill Simmons as GM, if you really want to aim for the worst owner in NBA history crown this is your best chance. Who says no? I wouldn't be shocked if ends his career on the top of that list. John Ringo's probably going to have to be the key for the Pacers here in this second half, especially since David West isn't looking 100% with the fever. Not likely. But, well, you never can completely rule this out with LeBron. I expect he would much rather not have to go into \"Cleveland\" mode in order to pull out a win here. Now that it's halftime, the question is: What does Indiana have to do to pull out a win tonight? They're only down by one, but the Heat are known to come out of the second half even more focused. We'll take all of your thoughts, questions, answers and jokes here throughout the second half. You could either email us at hunter.felt.freelance@guardiannews.com or tweet @HunterFelt. At this point the Indiana Pacers probably wish they could go back in time and convince the NBA not to suspend Chris Andersen. Joel Anthony, playing in place of the NBA's favorite sideshow attraction, has been a defensive force in this first half and his only points have come when Miami has needed them most. A Hibbert tap-it on a West shot gives Indiana the lead back. Then Roy Hibbert, who has been unstoppable in the paint, makes a two point shot. But the lead doesn't last thanks to a Joel Anthony two-pointer, the Heat get a James dunk off of a Pacers turnover, Anthony's monster game continues when he blocks Hill's shot which LeBron James recovers and the Heat end the first half with a lead. It feels like the Pacers are down by way more than three points, but since the Heat rattled off this stretch with LeBron James on the bench, that makes it feel like a 13 point absence. And here he comes back now. The Pacers have the ball out of the timeout. Hill takes a shot attempt in pressure, but Joel Anthony denies it. LeBron James misses his first shot, leading to a Paul George layup on the other end. Paul George gets tripped up by Cole and picks up a foul call and Miami takes a timeout. Huge huge run from the Heat here. Norris Cole, indeed having a game, responds with two-points of his own. Ray Allen tries for a three and misses it, but gets it back with an offensive rebound, and then he finally nails one. That was going to happen eventually, Miami leads again. The Miami Heat, of course, tied the game up with LeBron James on the bench, where he might not be for the remainder of the game. That was essentially an eight point swing in favor of Miami (four missed points on Indiana, four gained points for Miami). Paul George makes his shot coming out of the timeout to give the Pacers a lead though. Another missed layup for Indiana, this time from Sam Young, which they can't afford especially in this period where LeBron James is on the bench. The Heat take advantage, Norris Cole gets two on the other end. Oh dear lord this is getting slapstick-y. David West misses another dunk for Indiana, and then the Heat take advantage AGAIN when Cole gets a game-tying layup. The Pacers take a timeout. That's just a brutal brutal sequence there. After some missed opportunities by both sides, Ray Allen gets the ball and gets an easy two points for the first Miami points in quite a while. The Pacers are playing better inside the paint and the Heat are playing better from beyond the three-point line. An interesting matchup, we'll see if Erik Spoelstra changes things up here after the timeout. Sam Young recovers a ball and gets it to Lance Stephenson... Who gets knocked down by Joel Anthony on the layup attempt. To the line goes Stephenson who makes both. it's doing everything in my power not to make references to Kate Bush's \"Running Up That Hill\" related puns when talking about George Hill. I'm trying to sound as less like Alan Partridge as possible here. Okay, George Hill makes another three-pointer for Indiana, that makes a lot more sense. Pacers get the lead. Cole misses the shot, West gets the rebound, Hill gets the ball again and he makes a monster layup. That's 5 straight points for Hill in a handful of seconds and the Heat have to call a timeout. Yikes. Ray Allen is in the game and he.... passes instead of shoots, which works out because LeBron James is there for a dunk. And then the Pacers finally make a three-pointer thanks to... Sam Young? Seriously, Sam Young? Joel Anthony playing for Chris Andersen makes a killer block on a Roy Hibbert shot attempt after a key offensive block. Then he gets a chance at a layup for Miami and he manages to miss it. Andersen woulda had that. Should we count LeBron James' half-court attempted buzzer beater as a three-point attempt? If not, Miami has been perfect from behind the line. I'm confident in saying if that trend keeps up there will be no Game 7. The Miami Heat are refusing to miss threes, which means that Indiana could be in trouble. In this case, it's Norris Cole (who maybe will have the career night I predicted he would have last game on Twitter). Thankfully for Indiana Hibbert manages to make a low-percentage 11-footer to cut the Heat lead down to 2 before the end of the first quarter. Roy Hibbert gets to the line and makes one of two free throws. That's not going to do it if they want a chance to win here. Paul George makes a phenomenal dunk to get the crowd to cheer... Until LeBron James hits a three a few seconds later to shut them all up. So much for momentum I guess. Did I mention that LeBron James can shoot the three now? Because he totally can, and that's scary. He makes one here to regain the lead for Miami. Lance Stephenson makes another steal and THIS time Paul George gets in, makes a dunk. Chalmers comes out with two fouls, replaced by Norris Cole. West's first free throw goes in but he misses the second. David West misses ANOTHER easy look for Indiana, but Miami bails him out by picking up a foul on the play. Miami takes a full timeout. Lance Stephenson gets a technical, giving a free throw to Wade, who makes it. Then Supernintendo Chalmers makes a three-pointer. Paul George gets fouled on a layup and only makes one of his two free throws. Another thing that the Pacers can't afford to do anymore. Wade gets called for traveling, and Roy Hibbert makes a shot. The Pacers then get it back when Bosh misses a three-pointer... And Paul George misses an open layup, they cannot afford to do that too many more times. Lance Stephenson brings it in and.... can't get it to Paul George, and the ball deflects off of him making it Miami ball. LeBron James gets to the rim, and the officials call a foul on Indiana. James gets a look at the basket but can't convert. The Pacers get the ball and get it to the big guy Hibbert who cashes it in to tie the game. The notes to that clip were \"even worse than the one in Naked Gun\" Roy Hibbert side-steps Haslem and makes a layup, so far so good on getting everyone involved for Indiana. LeBron James responds with a jumper and Indiana takes its first time out. Not a bad beginning for Indiana, but not great either. And there's Chris Bosh, he hits a three-pointer! And the Pacers turn the ball over on a bad pass by George, that won't be the first time this game. Pacers respond quickly on back-to-back baskets from Paul George and George Hill. Then George steals the ball from LeBron James and dumps it in to get the lead. Wade's first shot misses, he's not looking good. LeBron James makes a layup on Miami's next position though. Looking good so far. And after a brief scoreless streak, Mario Chalmers starts off the scoring for a three ball for the Heat. On the other end, Chris Bosh picks up a foul. And we're off! Okay this is a hockey clip, but this is what I think what would ever happen if I were forced to sing the Star Spangled Banner at any sporting event. Nothing like feeling one's mortality right before covering a potential close-out game in the playoffs. Thanks a lot Grant Hill's retirement. Jason Kidd is now officially not allowed to retire. This tweet is approved by LeBron James's mom. (Allegedly.) The starting lineups have been released early and there are no surprises. David West is playing, as expected, which is good news for Indiana because the Pacers bench is cellophane thin. Miami Heat Mario Chalmers, point guard Dwyane Wade, shooting guard LeBron James, forward Udonis Haslem, power forward Chris Bosh, center Indiana Pacers George Hill, point guard Lance Stephenson, shooting guard Paul George, forward David West, power forward Roy Hibbert, center I hope so, this has been an amazing series that demands a Game 7. Also Grant Hill was one of the greatest celebrity endorsers in modern sports history, he was the first post-modernist amongst his NBA peers. (ka-CHING) Well this is something sad but expected, Grant Hill, most recently of the Los Angeles Clippers, has announced his retirement after what could very well be a Hall of Fame career. Just being on a half-hour conference call with Hill earlier this year was enough to get a sense of what a thoughtful, humble guy he was. Maybe next up will be the career in politics that he has been hinting at. I'm convinced that the Miami Heat pull away from the Indiana Pacers after they make their halftime adjustments. I'm saying the Heat 91 - Pacers 74, but keep in mind I've been wrong about nearly every prediction so far in the Eastern Conference Finals. So, what do you think will happen? Who wins tonight, and why? Email your predictions to hunter.felt.freelance@guardiannews.com or tweet them to @HunterFelt and we'll use them during the course of this liveblog. The Pacers' David West apparently is fighting a fever, so didn't participate in practice. While West is expected to play, it's a concern for Indiana who are going to need a solid game from him to push this to a Game 7. In the meantime, the Boston Bruins will be playing against the Pittsburgh Penguins today in game one of their NHL playoffs series and the Boston Red Sox are playing against the New York Yankees. This mean I might actually be the only sports fan in the Boston area watching this Heat/Pacers game. I'm a loner, Dottie, a rebel. So tonight at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, the Miami Heat will face off against the Indiana Pacers in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals. If the Pacers win, they will push this series to a winner-takes-all Game 7 on Monday in Miami's American Airlines Arena. If the Heat win tonight, they get a few extra days rest before they face off against the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Finals starting on June 6th. In some respects, the Indiana Pacers are playing with house money tonight. Just taking this series to a sixth game was something of an upset, just ask the Milwaukee Bucks or Chicago Bulls. This is a Miami Heat team that is not only built around the best player in the game, that would be LeBron James, but that also went on a 27 game win streak during the regular season. So the fact that Indiana won two out of five against them to start the ECF? Impressive. Unfortunately for them, they seem to have made the mistake of getting LeBron James angry which, at least on the basketball court, is about as wise as making Bruce Banner angry. So, in the second half of Game 5 on Thursday, the Pacers had to face the league MVP in \"LeBron Smash!\" mode, and they're now one game away from elimination. The Miami Heat are rightfully favored tonight, but it should be noted that the Pacers play tougher at home, and that they've responded to every loss against this Miami team with a well-deserved win. In order to clinch their third straight NBA Finals appearance tonight they will need help from somebody other than James. An injured Dwyane Wade has only been a major factor in Game 3 of this series, Chris Bosh has mostly been invisible, and Ray Allen, the greatest three-point shooter in NBA history, has been ice cold off the bench. The Heat cannot rely on Udonis \"Yes I'm still in the league\" Haslem to again be their second-best offensive option tonight unless they are really desperate to clinch at home. (Okay so I've been wrong about Haslem not able to repeat his Game 3 performance before, but I guarantee that he will not have another 16-17 point night tonight.) The Pacers basically have to hope that James doesn't get much help from his teammates, that James isn't as good as he was in Game 5 and that they get contributions from their entire lineup. On Thursday night swingman Paul George (the breakout player of this series), center Roy Hibbert (the star of Game 4) and forward David West (still somehow underrated) were the only significant offensive threats. That can't happen tonight if the Pacers want to continue playing basketball. Luckily for everyone on Indiana, not to mention everyone at home watching the game on HD, the league suspended Chris \"Birdman\" Andersen, who hasn't missed a shot in the series, for Game 6 for shoving Tyler Hansbrough on Thursday. This was a good call by the NBA, but he really did deserve to be suspended at least one more game for those neck tattoos alone. Considering all of this, tonight's game most likely will either a) come down to the last possession, or possibly overtime, or b) will be a complete Miami blowout midway through the third quarter. Whichever happens, we will be here until the very end, using your contributions. Send us your thoughts, questions, conspiracy theories or Chris Andersen tattoo suggestions by either emailing hunter.felt.freelance@guardiannews.com or tweeting @HunterFelt. Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Miami Heat and the Indiana Pacers starts at 8:30pm EST, I'll be back shortly with predictions, starting lineups and random \"Chris Bosh in the Multiverse\" references."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
