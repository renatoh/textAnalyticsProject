The dead were: pilots Stephen Potton, from Blackpool; and Simon Foddering, from Preston; and passengers Robert Warburton, 60, from Heysham, Lancashire; Leslie Ahmed, 48, from South Shields; John Shaw, 51, from Kirkcaldy, Fife; and Alfred Neasham, 57, from Durham. Police said the chances of finding the missing passenger alive were now \"slim\". The search and rescue operation to locate Keith Smith from Stockton-on-Tees has now been called off for the day amid worsening weather conditions and will be resumed on Friday. The men were on a routine helicopter flight when it ditched into the sea 24 miles out to sea and 500 metres short of the gas rig where it was about to land at around 6.30pm. The cause of the accident is not yet known. Detective Superintendent Mick Gradwell, of Lancashire police, said the helicopter left Blackpool at about 6pm. It flew to one rig, picked up a number of people, then flew to a second rig and was on its way to a third when it plunged into the sea. It was 500 metres from the third rig when it \"reared to the left\" before crashing in the sea. Three people witnessed the crash. Keith Mullett, from the helicopter company CHC Scotia, said Mr Potton was the firm's chief pilot in the area and described him as \"extremely experienced\". Mr Foddering joined the company about a year ago but was also an experienced pilot, he said. Sam Laidlaw, from the gas firm Centrica, which had chartered the aircraft, said the company was \"deeply saddened\" by the tragedy. \"Our priority is to provide as much support as we can,\" he said. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the families at this terrible time.\" Mr Ahmed's family were planning to hold a late Christmas celebration tomorrow as he had been working over the holidays. Presents were still wrapped under the Christmas tree in the front room of the family's large semi-detached home on South Tyneside. A family source said his 40-year-old wife Julie had travelled to Blackpool today. They married six years ago and have two sons, Lewis, 12, and Joel, aged 10. \"He was such a loving family man and a great father to his boys,\" the source said. An investigation by the Air Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) has been launched. Gas fields in the sea between Blackpool and Ireland have been in operation for more than 20 years. The two main fields, North and South Morecambe, are 25 miles west of the town of Morecambe. The South Morecambe field was discovered in 1974 and the North Morecambe field two years later, but the first gas was not drawn from the south field until 1985. The gas platforms are sunk 30 metres into the ocean and are plumbing reserves estimated at close to 180bn cubic metres of gas. Usually 143 staff are working offshore at any time and they are transported to the platform by helicopter from Blackpool airport."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
