Welcome to Nile and Bernard's international party space. The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor Jam City: How We Relate To The Body Humbling and beautiful to see people react to this in exactly the way I dreamed of when I wrote it. The track I wish I'd signed to my label Bernard Sjazner: Welcome To Deathrow This track is midnight but functional and weirdly club-ready. I think it could find a home at Night Slugs in another era. The track that got me out of bed this morning Nguzunguzu: No Longer Welcome to the 21st century: the Akira soundtrack is pinging back and forth off unfriendly towers. The track I'd play at my auntie's wedding Change: Miracles For anyone brave enough to shout about the joy and chance of true love, this is for you. The track that should have been a crossover hit Anne Clark: Bursting Was this is a hit? I wasn't alive then. John Foxx-produced genius; an \"aggressive pop\" record. The world needs more of these. The track I wish i'd never played Cory Daye: Green Light Too personal, too intricate maybe, to be appreciated on a dancefloor, even though it deserves to be. The ideal festival track The Residents: Diskomo I've never been to a festival but I'm told there's lots of mud and drugs. I'm not into either but the combination of the two might sound something like this? Smothered, exhausted dance music. The best track by my favourite new artist Inc: Millionairess It came out last year but nothing has captured my imagination like it since. The Aged brothers remind me just how much music can do. The track I'd play at sunset in Ibiza Jean Jacques Smoothie: 2 People It's 1999 and you're hanging out with Sara Cox at Cream; after tonight, the world becomes a very dark place. The track I want played at my funeral Sterling Void: It's Alright Not a dry eye in the house, but hopefully everyone would leave with a smile on their face. Jam City plays Plastic People, EC1, Fri; his Classical Curves album is out now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
