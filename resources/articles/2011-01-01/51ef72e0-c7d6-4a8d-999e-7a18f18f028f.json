John Morris, Derbyshire's director of cricket, said: \"Successful stints in County Cricket have played an integral part in the development of many successful Australian cricketers and I'm sure Usman will benefit hugely from this experience. \"He has scored runs consistently for New South Wales and is also proving to be a very entertaining player to watch.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
