A major new survey shows that women who take time out to have children are likely to face lower wages when they return to employment, compared with those who stay on the career treadmill. Low part-time wages, coupled with higher salaries in typically 'male' occupations, also help to sustain the gap, according to Sylvia Walby, Professor of Sociology at Leeds University, and Wendy Olsen, lecturer at Manchester University. The pair found that, over a seven-year period, women who remained in their careers experienced a 15 per cent increase in wages on average. In contrast, those who took career breaks to look after their families saw the increase drop by 2 per cent a year for each year they were out of employment. The findings suggest that employers are hard-nosed when it comes to determining their workers' salaries. 'The importance of motherhood in women's pay is nil. It is their labour market experience that counts,' Olsen said. The two academics, whose work is being closely studied by the Government's Women and Equality Unit, say the pay gap - the largest in the EU - can be bridged only by improving skills and training women returning to work. 'The Government puts a lot of effort in getting unemployed people back to work, but not enough for women whose careers have been interrupted,' Walby said. Men currently earn 25 per cent more than women. The average male worker earns \u00a310.27 an hour, compared with \u00a37.50 an hour for the average female. Women in traditionally 'female' occupations, notably cleaning and secretarial work, continue to suffer from low wages. The survey found that women working in typically 'male' occupations are paid an extra 53p per hour. Walby said it was up to the Government to take the lead. 'The UK has massively increased subsidised child care, but it's still very little compared with other European countries. It's very difficult to combine a career and employment in the UK.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
