It is overlooked by two forts and it might be small but it's perfectly formed. Praia Pitua\u00e7u Ten minutes along the coast, but still in central Salvador, this is the place to have a good time. There are bars and clubs and lots of people really up for some fun. Praia Boca do Rio This is right by Pitua\u00e7u, but a completely opposite vibe: it is totally peaceful. I used to come here to chill out and relax. The rest of my favourite beaches are off the Linha Verde (the Green Line), which is the motorway north from Salvador. Praia Barra do Itariri About 70 miles up the Linha Verde, this is a place to have adventures. It's beautiful, calm and rustic, and it attracts quite a young crowd. It's a longer drive but it's definitely worth it. Praia de Imba\u00e7a\u00ed Ten miles up the Linha Verde, this beach is ideal if you want to relax. The infrastructure is great, the hotels are pretty good - and so it's a bit more expensive. A river separates the village of Imba\u00e7ai from the long thin, gorgeous beach. You can get here in no time at all from the city. \u00b7 Lower City (Cidade Baixa) - a film set in Salvador which won the Prix de la Jeunesse at Cannes this year - is out on 2 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
