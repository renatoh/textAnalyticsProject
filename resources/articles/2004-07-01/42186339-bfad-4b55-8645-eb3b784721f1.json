It is a cautionary tale, of his transformation from a young rider adamant that he would never use drugs to an embittered professional athlete disgusted with his use of banned substances. For reasons known only to a mole inside the French legal team which since March last year has been investigating alleged drug-taking and dealing within the Cofidis squad, the transcripts were leaked to L'Equipe's investigative reporter Damien Ressiot, as was a wealth of other material published in the sports daily just before Easter in which Millar was first named. The picture that emerges is a remarkably dignified one. It shows a man under immense pressure to perform in the face of crises in his personal life, and receiving little support or guidance in a situation where he was tempted to use drugs in a sport that was making unnatural demands on him. At the start of his career, Millar said, he had to feign illness and abandon races in order to get rest. \"I said to Cofidis that I needed to race less, but there were always riders who were injured or ill.\" According to his lawyer Paul-Albert Iweins, Millar \"explained that he was caught in a sort of maximum pressure as leader of the team, faced with the obligation to get results\". Iweins claimed Cofidis had had a \"policy of generally hiding their head in the sand\". Millar also relates the personal crisis that almost led him to quit the sport in 2000, after finishing the Tour de France, when he found himself alone in his flat in Biarritz. \"I had been living in a privileged, cosseted milieu. I found the sudden transition hard to deal with and I wondered if all these sacrifices were worth the bother, just to be alone after the race. I was asking questions about my life and the direction I wanted it to go in.\" He relates how, instead of going to the world championships in 2000, he \"disappeared\". He added: \"My parents were worried; they could see I was changing, I was becoming unstable.\" Millar says he was introduced to the idea of using the blood booster erythropoietin (EPO) by another rider during the 2001 Tour de France when he crashed in the prologue time-trial and continued in spite of his injuries \"because, in cycling, you only stop if you've broken something. I had 10 days of atrocious suffering on a physical level, and most of all on a mental level. \"During that Tour de France and while I was going badly [another rider] said to me that we would do a good job of preparing for the Tour of Spain. He saw that I was unhappy with the team and myself. \"I understood what that meant . . . I knew what was going on.\" In August 2001, Millar said, he paid the rider \u00a3250 per syringe for EPO and was shown how to inject it in his shoulder. \"I took EPO because I knew that the Cofidis team was going to the Tour of Spain on condition that I started and got a result. No one had any need to put pressure on me, but I felt it. As I was not happy in my life, I had based everything on my sporting career and I only saw myself as a cyclist and I thought people only saw me like that. \"After taking EPO for the Tour of Spain in 2001 I did not feel good. For me I was a cheat; I had crossed the line and I felt bad. I doped because my job was to arrive highly placed at the finish. There were magazines, sports newspapers, television stations waiting for my results.\" In 2002, in the midst of an intense personal crisis, Millar began working with a Spanish doctor. \"At the start of 2002 I did not want to touch my bike any more. I had gone to Australia with my girlfriend at the end of 2001. It had gone badly. I had destroyed everything I had built with her . . . I was very bad mentally, and I came back with glandular fever. \"I contacted [the doctor], who put me on a course of vitamin B12, Prefolic and [a product to detoxify his liver].\" Millar said he won his 2002 Tour stage in B\u00e9ziers without recourse to EPO but kept the two empty syringes after winning the world time-trial title in Canada following a course of the drug as \"testimony to the shame I felt at doping myself. I was not proud of doping; I was not happy about it.\" His conclusion is telling: \"You dope because you are a prisoner of yourself, of glory, of money. I was a prisoner of the person that I had become.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
