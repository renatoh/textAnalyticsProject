It seems I was the lucky one. We'd just taken off when our pilot apparently smelled smoke and decided to put the plane back down instantly. Thank God for ABS breaks. Within seconds the plane was surrounded by fire engines, and firemen came on board to look for a suspected fire, but we were eventually given the all-clear to resume our journey. A few passengers refused to travel, though, and insisted on leaving the plane \u2013 which was a bit over-dramatic, especially as you could smell smoke before we boarded. I'd hazard a guess it had something to do with the tyres and rubbish they were burning in the field beside the runway. So apologies for not joining in the inquest on England, but I think I have a reasonable excuse. By the time we arrived in Cape Town the mood said it all about the England performance anyway. We met a few people who had booked a place for a post-match party but had decided against it, and I had breakfast with a few dejected England fans yesterday. Everyone is so disappointed. The atmosphere is flat. The main topic of conversation was Wayne Rooney and England's failure to break down stubborn opposition playing 4-5-1. I can't comment on the particulars of England's performance but I can do so on the subject as a whole because it is a recurring theme at the World Cup and not a problem unique to Fabio Capello's side. Switzerland are the best exponents of intelligent defensive play I've seen in South Africa, cleverly forcing Spain to go wide and preventing them playing through the middle. They could make their system work because they had powerful centre-backs and a goalkeeper who was prepared to come out and command his area. If a team is well-marshalled and disciplined, with every player doing his job for 90 minutes, it doesn't matter what the system is; you are going to find it very difficult to score. What is the solution for an attacking side? Ideally you would have good technical players, people who are patient in possession and a few individuals who can conjure something special. The alternative is more basic; you direct the play up against their centre-backs and look to benefit from any scraps. But the quality of your opponent is also a factor. For example, Germany couldn't have gone that way against Serbia because Nemanja Vidic and Neven Subotic were outstanding in the air. This is where Joachim L\u00f6w or any other manager in his position has to find something that gives the team a lift \u2013 where the manager must make a positive change. But there have been precious few impact substitutions at this tournament so far. Germany's two substitutions against Serbia had no effect on the game whatsoever. In fairness, I thought the team played well with 10 men having had the misfortune to come across the worst refereeing performance of the competition. The officials have been really good in the main but Alberto Undiano of Spain, who works in one of the top leagues in the world, was a disgrace. Anyway, back to my point. The most effective substitution has been Italy's introduction of Mauro Camoranesi against Paraguay. As soon as he came on, Italy went 4-4-2 and improved considerably. Camoranesi had an instant impact, and though he collected a quick booking for nailing his man his introduction dragged Italy's performance level up. Marcello Lippi showed it can be done, but it has not been done enough. I'm amazed that neither Nigeria or South Korea pushed a left-winger up against Jon\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez in their games against Argentina. Guti\u00e9rrez is a good midfielder but he's never a right\u2011back and wouldn't be able to handle someone pressing on him. It's been said that Switzerland, Algeria and others are following the template that brought Otto Rehhagel success with Greece at Euro 2004, but the problems that confronted Fabio Capello on Friday night are nothing new. At the 1990 World Cup, Ireland reverted to a 4-1-4-1 when we didn't have the ball. Jack Charlton would tell one of his forwards to drop back and sit on the defensive midfielder. The onus is then on your opponent to produce a moment of ingenuity or prosper from a lucky break. England's opening results mirror Ireland's in 2002, and we needed to win our final group game to go through, but the performances mean there is no comparison between the situation I faced and Capello's. We drew 1-1 with a good Cameroon side and a German team who would not concede another goal until they lost in the final. Apart from the opening 15 minutes against Germany I thought we were the better side and, while there is always a nagging doubt going into games, I knew that if we maintained our level against Saudi Arabia we would win. But Slovenia are a much better side than Saudi Arabia, and Capello has admitted he needs to change things. The positive for England is that it is now all-or-nothing against Slovenia. Not the scenario they will have envisaged admittedly, but one that often suits the British mentality. England's top players must respond to the pressure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
