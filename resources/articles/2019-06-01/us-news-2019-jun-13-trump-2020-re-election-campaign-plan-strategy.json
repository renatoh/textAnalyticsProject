Trump set to launch 2020 campaign", "bodyText": "When Donald Trump launches his presidential re-election campaign this week, he will do it at a rally in the Amway Center \u2013 home to sports teams Orlando Magic, Orlando Solar Bears and Orlando Predators \u2013 in a part of Florida better known for Cape Canaveral and Walt Disney World. It will be four years and two days since the property developer and reality TV star descended an escalator at Trump Tower in New York to launch the longest of long-shot campaigns by raging against unfair trade deals and promising to \u201cbuild a great wall\u201d on the US-Mexico border. He was dismissed. He was scorned. He was laughed at. But he had the last laugh. To the astonishment and consternation of the establishment, Trump went on to offer the ultimate proof that in America, anyone can be president. He beat 16 fellow Republicans, then Democrat Hillary Clinton, to become the first person to reach the Oval Office with no political or military experience. Now he has to hope that lightning can strike twice. On Tuesday 18 June, Trump, accompanied by the first lady, Melania Trump, the vice-president, Mike Pence and the second lady, Karen Pence, will hold a Make America Great Again rally in Orlando, Florida, a state that is home to his Mar-a-Lago resort and is usually a pivotal battleground in presidential elections. This time the insurgent is the incumbent, lacking outsider status or shock value, but boasting all the advantages of incumbency, a vast war chest and buy-in from Republican party mandarins. Will he run a more conventional campaign this time? Will he heed the advice of his well-paid advisers? Has the presidency changed him at all? \u201cHell no!\u201d said Michael Steele, former chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC). \u201cI remember doing an interview the week of the inaugural and I said my assessment going into this new administration hinges on the answer to a question: will Donald Trump be changed by the presidency or will he change the presidency itself? And the answer is very clear at this point. He has fundamentally changed the presidency of the United States and it will take a man or woman of incredible character to restore it.\u201d Trump\u2019s 2020 strategy Back in 2016, which here in Washington feels like millennia ago, Trump ran as a celebrity businessman who glorified in trashing norms and expertise, hurling vulgar insults and sticking two fingers up to the political elite. In 2020, he will run as a celebrity businessman who glorifies in trashing norms and expertise, hurling vulgar insults and flipping off the political elite. Once a blur on the horizon, the outlines of his next campaign are coming into sharp focus. He has laid out his strategy for re-election in his tweets, his interviews, his speeches and his presidency thus far. It will probably be a rerun of 2016, throwing red meat to red states in a series of high-octane rallies and Fox News interviews that lean in to America\u2019s toxic tribalism. Most conventionally, Trump and his allies will tout the economy. Trump seldom misses an opportunity to talk about stock market highs, growth topping 3% or unemployment hitting the lowest rate in half a century. The White House relishes recycling old comments from Democrat Nancy Pelosi likening Trump\u2019s tax cuts to \u201cArmageddon\u201d or economist Paul Krugman\u2019s prophecy of \u201cglobal recession, with no end in sight\u201d. Ronna McDaniel, current chair of the RNC, told Fox News in May: \u201cThe case is gonna be the economy, economy, economy, period.\u201d Trump\u2019s speechwriters are also likely to trumpet his two supreme court appointments, bipartisan criminal justice reform and an \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to foreign policy that he claims defeated Islamic State and brought the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, to the negotiating table. But in the 2018 midterms, Trump tended to veer off teleprompter and trample on his own message. He talked less conspicuously about the economy than immigration, whipping up fear of caravans from Central America pouring over the border. The nativist message, with its naked appeals to white nationalism at rallies resounding to chants of \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d, seems certain to loom large again. Once again, critics say, Trump will adopt the politics of divide and rule, riling up his base rather than broadening his coalition. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be immigration all the time, scaring people about those brown folks coming across the border,\u201d Steele said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be playing to his nationalistic tendencies because he\u2019s an autocrat at heart and that\u2019s the space he knows and occupies. And he\u2019s reinforced now by an attorney general who also believes apparently in the autocracy of an untouchable president. \u201cSo Trump, having been reinforced from a legal perspective, feels that he probably can go out there and keep swinging at the fences on these very delicate issues like immigration, which are tinged with race and xenophobia, and then in between throw in, \u2018Yeah, the economy is doing great\u2019. Because the truth of that, as I think the numbers have borne out, is while the economy is strong and GDP is great, most people aren\u2019t necessarily realising the benefit.\u201d Progressive groups are braced for the onslaught. Maurice Weeks, co-executive director of the Action Center on Race and the Economy, said: \u201cI expect a lot more talk about the wall. I expect a lot more talk about Muslims. I expect a lot more outwardly racist, sexist and homophobic things and that really won\u2019t be a break from anything that\u2019s happened since before he was elected up until now. I think that he\u2019s just going to keep hammering on these things that have maintained his level of support at this scarily high level.\u201d Weeks added: \u201cHe\u2019s never said this meme that we\u2019ve heard from presidents, like after you get elected you\u2019re going to reach across and heal the nation by bringing them together. That\u2019s just not his game.\u201d Lessons from 2016 Trump\u2019s first campaign thrived as much on what it was against as what it was for. He lambasted the political and media elites and, towards the end of the campaign, kept promising to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d. But enemy No 1 was his opponent, Clinton, whom he branded \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d as he spoke endlessly about her emails amid chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d In 2020, Clinton will not be on the ballot. Trump already has new ammunition, however. He has been quick to seize on the ascent of self-declared democratic socialists such as the 2020 Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders and millennial New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as well as Democrats\u2019 willingness to contemplate policies such as Medicare for All and a Green New Deal. Whoever ultimately wins the Democratic nomination, expect to hear a reprise of Trump\u2019s applause line at his 2019 State of the Union address: \u201cWe renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\u201d Erin Perrine, deputy communications director of the Trump 2020 campaign, said: \u201cDemocrats are, by their own admission, embracing socialism. Whoever comes out of the primary, they\u2019re going to be broken, they\u2019re going to be beaten up, they\u2019re going to be saddled with all these policies.\u201d The red scare tactic was used against Barack Obama in the 2008 election after he suggested that \u201cwhen you spread the wealth around, it\u2019s good for everybody\u201d, but to little effect. It may gain more traction if Democrats do not choose a centrist as their nominee. John Zogby, a pollster and author, said: \u201cThe socialism argument will try to go beyond his base to voters over 65 who do not like his behaviour but remember the cold war and worry the Democratic party may have moved too far left.\u201d If past is prologue, Trump will also traffic in falsehoods to win, portraying Democrats as favouring \u201copen borders\u201d and \u2013 to cement the crucial support of Christian evangelicals \u2013 as promoting late-term abortions and even \u201cinfanticide\u201d. He will try to turn the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation on its head, characterising it as a deep state \u201ccoup\u201d intended to thwart the forgotten men and women of America and urging: \u201cInvestigate the investigators!\u201d Although he holds the most powerful office in the world, he will revel in grievance and victimhood. Resources and Russia Whereas his 2016 campaign had an improvisational let\u2019s-do-the-show-right-here quality, this time it will be a formidable machine that can build a database of supporters and donors. It has already raised more than $100m and hired about 40 staff led by Brad Parscale, a digital guru promising it will \u201cbigger, better and badder\u201d by \u201cevery single metric\u201d. Perrine said: \u201cIn 2016, they were building the plane in play but they also managed to land the plane; they did a fantastic job. This will be a campaign befitting an incumbent president. We\u2019re going to have a massive ground game.\u201d Analysts agree the effort will be professionalised. Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a mom-and-pop campaign like it was in 2016. Tactically, they\u2019ll be much more sophisticated because he\u2019s the incumbent. They will be better staffed with much more resources. He may go off script any time at a rally but the TV ads will be better produced.\u201d Most infamously, the 2016 election was scarred by the Trump team\u2019s willingness to accept help from Russia, although the special counsel\u2019s report did not identify a criminal conspiracy, despite not entirely exonerating Trump. Could it happen again? Olsen said: \u201cI think after what everyone\u2019s been through over the last three years, you\u2019d have to be a complete idiot to go for something that foreigners provided. They say once bitten, twice shy. Many people have been scorched and scorched again by this, and they don\u2019t want to have third degree burns.\u201d But whatever guardrails are put in place, the great unknown is the candidate \u2013 capricious, mercurial, sometimes unhinged and always unconventional. Most presidents with his economic numbers would be polling much higher, but Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained stubbornly well below 50%. Rick Tyler, a political analyst and former spokesman for Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 campaign, said: \u201cThe campaign strategy should be, are you better off today than you were four years ago because, for many Americans, the answer would be yes. That\u2019s what I would run on, but this president is incapable of doing that. \u201cSo far, he\u2019s the victim and everyone\u2019s out to get to him and I don\u2019t know why that would appeal to voters. He has no message discipline, he\u2019s incapable of articulating a vision and his behaviour is obnoxious. All the economic trends point to him winning but he defies convention and I really am sceptical about his ability to cash in.\u201d Can Trump cash in? Trump\u2019s tenure in the Oval Office \u2013 where chiefs of staff, communications directors and others have come and gone with head-spinning speed \u2013 shows he is unlikely to listen to advice from his strategists. Tyler observed: \u201cIt bores him. There\u2019s no fight there. He\u2019s wired to fight. He\u2019s got to pick a fight.\u201d But while the 45th president is notoriously hard to tame, his campaign is likely to remain tightly controlled, hoping to steer him to victory despite himself. Even Trump will not be able to control every ad and social media post going out on his behalf. Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said: \u201cThe slogan they will try to sell is \u2018You\u2019ve never had it so good\u2019. The campaign surrogates will concede he is obstreperous, outlandish and not a very nice person, and you may not love him, but you love his policies. They\u2019ll make the case that he\u2019s an asshole, but he\u2019s your asshole.\u201d Like Steele, Sabato does not believe the presidency has changed Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s just as obnoxious as when he was elected. In some ways he\u2019s worse because he now has power. He\u2019s not got any better. He hasn\u2019t reached out in any way; we\u2019ve never had a president like that. Every other president has tried to unite the country but he\u2019s a divider, not a uniter.\u201d Days after Trump\u2019s election, Obama warned \u201cthis office has a way of waking you up\u201d and \u201creality has a way of asserting itself\u201d. But not with Trump. Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: \u201cHe\u2019s more self-aggrandising than he has ever been before and he\u2019s gotten away with more,\u201d she said. \u201cBut like many other presidents, he has become very focused on winning re-election. He\u2019s not on the golf course as much as in the first year. That\u2019s the only way in which he has changed.\u201d Some Democrats believe that Trump fluked his way to victory in 2016, losing the popular vote but prevailing in the electoral college based on 77,000 votes across three states, and will not be able to pull off the same trick twice. Bob Shrum, a veteran consultant on several presidential elections, said: \u201cIf it\u2019s a rerun of 2016, he will certainly lose because it\u2019s impossible to draw an inside straight twice in those three states, yet he shows no sign of broadening his appeal at all.\u201d Shrum, a political science professor at the University of Southern California, does think the office of the presidency has altered Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s made him worse. \u201cWe have a government undermining the law. It\u2019s dangerous in the sense that he worries about what would happen to him and his family if he doesn\u2019t get re-elected, so he\u2019ll do anything.\u201d Indeed, in 2016 Trump made great play of claiming the game was rigged against him, laying the groundwork so that if he lost, he could cry foul and claim the result would be illegitimate. It is a playbook he may well reach for again, especially if foreign powers seek to interfere. Trump\u2019s spurious claim of \u201ctotal exoneration\u201d in the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, and ongoing refusal to condemn Russia for its meddling, is an ominous sign. Steele, the former RNC chairman, said: \u201cBe afraid, be very afraid, be worried, be very worried, because here again the president has literally gotten away with allowing a foreign government to interfere in our election and his silence \u2013 and in some cases standing right next to [Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin] and pretty much putting his arm around saying I believe him over everybody else who has incontrovertible evidence \u2013 we should be very worried. \u201cSo 2020 is probably the most unsafe election in our history. We haven\u2019t even begun to seriously drill down on the depths of this \u2026 But unfortunately right now we don\u2019t have the leadership in our government that is saying that nor taking steps to to do something about it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
