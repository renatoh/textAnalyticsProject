The new company, to be called Raytheon Technologies, which will make Tomahawk missiles, the F-35 fighter jet engine and space suits for astronauts among other items, would have sales of about $74bn in 2019. It will be the second largest defense contractor behind Boeing and ahead of Lockheed Martin. The merger, the largest of the year so far, will have to be approved by competition authorities and was questioned by Donald Trump on Monday. Trump told CNBC that he was a \u201clittle concerned\u201d about the deal and that while he would like to see it go through he added: \u201cI want to see that we don\u2019t hurt our competition.\u201d Trump said aerospace companies had \u201call merged in so it\u2019s hard to negotiate\u201d with them and suggested the defense industry could be heading in the same direction. UTC and Raytheon do not compete directly in many markets and the deal may not attract significant scrutiny. The companies expect approval by 2020. \u201cI think from a regulatory standpoint, the beauty of this deal is there\u2019s very little overlap \u2026 But really less than 10 jurisdictions have to approve this. We don\u2019t have to go to China. We truly believe that we\u2019re going to get this done relatively quickly,\u201d Gregory Hayes, chairman and chief executive officer of United Technologies, said in a call with analysts. There have been a series of mergers in the defense contracting sector in recent years, driven by modest growth in US spending. Companies have argued that they need greater scale to compete and spend on research and technology. United Technologies\u2019 aerospace business makes engines for Airbus as well as the F-35, which was developed by Lockheed Martin and is the most expensive military project in history. Last year United announced it was spinning off its escalator and air-conditioner businesses, which included the Otis elevator brand and Carrier air conditioners. Raytheon makes missile defense and radar systems, including the Patriot missiles and other military technology used by militaries around the world. Together the two companies employ about 180,000 people worldwide. United technologies said the merger would lead to $1bn in cost savings. \u201cThe combination of United Technologies and Raytheon will define the future of aerospace and defense,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cOur two companies have iconic brands that share a long history of innovation, customer focus and proven execution. By joining forces, we will have unsurpassed technology and expanded R&amp;D capabilities that will allow us to invest through business cycles and address our customers\u2019 highest priorities.\u201d This article has been amended to clarify that United Technologies makes the F-35 fighter jet engine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
