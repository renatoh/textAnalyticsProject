The frontrunner to be Conservative leader and prime minister was videoed giving a rabble-rousing stump speech to members in Sutton Coldfield on Saturday, the day after the Guardian revealed that police had been called to his girlfriend\u2019s flat following a late-night altercation. Asked by one party member what he would do with the NHS, Johnson told the crowd the health service was a \u201ccrowning glory\u201d but was \u201cnot getting the kind of support and indeed the kind of changes and management that it needs\u201d, suggesting he as prime minister would aim to undertake an overhaul of the health service. He said Simon Stevens, the NHS chief executive, had once helped him get elected president of the Oxford Union as a student, and together they would \u201csort things out\u201d. In remarks that may alarm those opposed to another reorganisation of the NHS, Johnson said: \u201cIt needs more money but where you are absolutely right is that it needs reform.\u201d His delivery in private appeared to be more energised than at a separate public appearance at a hustings in Birmingham on Saturday, where he refused to answer questions from the moderator Iain Dale about the row with his partner, Carrie Symonds. He told Dale the audience did not want to hear about \u201cthat sort of thing\u201d. At the garden party, Johnson got cheers and cries of \u201cyou\u2019re the man for the job\u201d as he told members that his plan was to \u201cget Brexit done, relaunch our party as the party of modern progressive conservatism and then get ready to wallop Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. Asking for their support, he also promised to \u201cknock Jeremy Corbyn into a cocked hat where he belongs\u201d in an apparent sign his sights are fixed on an election. On policy, he mostly concentrated his 10-minute stump speech \u2013 likely to be repeated to party members across the country \u2013 on the need to improve policing, faster broadband and wealth creation. His biggest applause from members was for his attack on Corbyn for being a \u201cHamas-supporting, antisemitism-condoning, Hugo-Ch\u00e1vez-admiring apologist for the Kremlin\u201d, whom he branded \u201cderanged\u201d for wanting to embark on a programme of renationalisation. The day after the furore over the row, Johnson went to private events in Bicester and Sutton Coldfield as well as the Birmingham hustings. The next day, his whereabouts are unknown but a photograph of mysterious provenance appeared on Monday appearing to show him sitting with Symonds in a Sussex garden on Sunday. Johnson declined 26 times to say how the picture emerged, when it was taken or why it was released to the Mail Online."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
