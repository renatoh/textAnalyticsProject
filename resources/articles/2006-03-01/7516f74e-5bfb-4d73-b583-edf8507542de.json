Andy Burnham told a London conference that the chip and pin system could be used as an \"intermediate\" measure by shops, banks and other organisations to confirm people's identity. It had been previously suggested that verification would be done by scanning the biometric information also encoded in the card giving details of cardholders' fingerprints, face and iris. Mr Burnham's admission at the Social Market Foundation conference that the chip and pin system was needed comes as the government today begins preparing for a showdown between Commons and Lords over the scheme. For the third time last night peers voted by a majority of 35 that anyone applying for, or renewing, their passport should not automatically be registered on the national identity database. The government will today again ask MPs to overturn that defeat. Such ping-pong between the Commons and the Lords is often cut short by the end of the parliamentary session. But the summer recess is four months away and the home secretary, Charles Clarke, has made clear he is prepared to hold late night votes every week until the end of the session in July to get it through. A senior Home Office source said: \"We are happy to ping-pong until July. We're prepared to do that repeatedly. We believe that the bill is right. At some point the Lords will have to consider the will of the elected chamber.\" The alternative is to use the Parliament Act to ram through the legislation despite the opposition of peers. But that would involve introducing a new bill in the next session and a delay in putting the ID cards legislation on the statute book could prove highly damaging to the project. The Home Office cannot start awarding the contracts worth more than \u00a33bn until the legislation reaches the statute book. The timetable has already slipped to 2008-09 and if Mr Clarke has to use the Parliament Act to force it through the first ID cards may not be issued until 2010, beyond the date of the next general election. The tug of war will start in earnest this afternoon when Labour MPs are asked to vote down the peers' insistence that everybody should be able to tick a box on their passport renewal form saying they do not want their details placed on the new identity database. Peers insist that without this safeguard, Labour's manifesto promise that ID cards will be voluntary will be meaningless. The home secretary has retorted that the scheme remains voluntary because nobody is required to have a passport. It is an argument that could continue right up to the close of the session at the end of July - if peers have the stamina."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
