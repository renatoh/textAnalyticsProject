Four contestants have gone home since my last recap, and we\u2019re already rocketing into finals week. This joyous little show is almost over. Luckily there\u2019s nothing else going on today, so we can dedicate our full attention to it. Look. I know you\u2019re destined to spend the day doom-scrolling an election live blog, but you made the right call to read about some tiny children eating ice-cream first. Sunday night\u2019s elimination had two rounds. The first was a taste test: the kids had to sample dozens of delicious ice-creams and correctly pick the flavours. Fun! The second: the four kids who guessed incorrectly had to recreate an ornate snow globe made of sugar inside a fairy floss fireball. It was a world-first dish custom-made by Darren Purchese, a renowned pastry chef with more than two decades of experience. Um \u2026 Georgia rightly noted that \u201cadults have trouble completing pressure tests [like this] and now they\u2019re getting four kids to\u201d. Ruby\u2019s eyes widened. Filo hung his head, defeated. Ben, a living cherub, whispered into the void: \u201cI\u2019m only 10.\u201d Despite all this, the kids really pulled it off. Filo was the MVP. He cruised through each element, kept his bench clean for the first time in the competition, and started talking about Darren Purchese like they went way back. If only I had the confidence of this small Egyptian king. For the others, the elimination came down to small details. Ruby\u2019s glaze didn\u2019t have enough gelatin. Ben\u2019s cake was too dense. They were both sent home. It\u2019s sad news for these two exceptional young chefs and catastrophic news for Network Ten: I\u2019m pretty sure 90% of the show\u2019s audience tuned in for Ben and Ben alone, the sweet trumpet-playing Cub scout from Bendigo. Put out your bao buns. Unfortunately there\u2019s no time to mourn this loss because the very next night Curtis Stone is buried in a pile of potatoes. \u201cI always walk around with a potato!\u201d Curtis yells at the children. \u201cEverywhere I go, I always carry a big pot of mashed potato,\u201d he says, inexplicably. \u201cSay hello to Curtis!\u201d Jock instructs the kids. \u201cHe can see you!!!!\u201d The kids had 75 minutes to make a dish that featured potatoes. Also, for an extra challenge, every crucial ingredient was placed on the top shelf of an adult-size pantry. Vienna made some crispy croquettes and Laura nailed gnocchi on her very first try, but the best two dishes came from Georgia and Dev \u2013 both curries. Georgia\u2019s dish was a special yellow potato curry from her Sri Lankan grandma. Jock said \u201cdelicious isn\u2019t even a good enough word [to describe it]\u201d, and Andy said it made him \u201cexcited to live in Australia\u201d. That\u2019s a pretty great review! Georgia celebrated by showing the country a tooth falling out of her mouth in real-time. On Tuesday, the kids were given an actual truckload of fruit and veg. It was a good call after a week of ingesting ice-cream, flammable fairy floss, fried potato and fear. In this elimination challenge, they had to create a dish based around one ingredient. The catch: if they chose a fruit, they\u2019d have to make a savoury dish; if they chose a vegetable, it had to be a dessert. Most ran towards the easy choices: Vienna grabbed a pumpkin, Filo loaded up on carrots. But Tiffany actively decided to \u201cchallenge\u201d herself with zucchini: a vegetable that tastes like dense water. It doesn\u2019t work out. She makes a smart zucchini sponge cake with a perfect granita, but the judges can\u2019t even taste the main ingredient. Vienna also runs into trouble with her spiced pumpkin tart. Her main ingredient is used so well, but the tart itself is underbaked. She couldn\u2019t even save it by going full Poh. Filo was nervous for the verdict. \u201cI can\u2019t feel butterflies, I can literally feel pigeons running around in my stomach,\u201d he said. But it\u2019s Vienna and Tiffany who are sent home. This means that Dev, Georgia, Filo, Carter and Laura are into Sunday night\u2019s semi-final! What made me feel the most inadequate Kids are out here making food into magic spheres and turning fennel pollen into sherbert. Laura\u2019s veggie dessert was an incredible fennel and apple sorbet with almond cream, fennel sherbert and blackberry coulis pearls. The judges said it was \u201cone of the best dishes we\u2019ve seen in MasterChef \u2013 period\u201d. What I\u2019ll be thinking about all week Honestly, just the support these little legends show each other at every step of the competition. Channel your inner Filo this week. The next time you see someone having a hard time, let them know: \u201cBro, you\u2019re doing amazing.\u201d \u2022 Junior MasterChef continues on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday nights on Network Ten. Guardian Australia recaps run each Wednesday"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
