Lukaku was sold to Manchester United for \u00a375m in the summer having rejected a contract worth \u00a3140,000 a week at Everton in March. The Belgium international had wanted to rejoin Chelsea at the time and, according to Moshiri, may have extended his stay at Goodison but for a religious intervention. Moshiri was addressing Everton\u2019s general meeting, after which the chairman, Bill Kenwright, confirmed the costs of the club\u2019s proposed new stadium at Bramley Moore dock had escalated towards \u00a3500m. At the end of the meeting a shareholder asked the club\u2019s board why Lukaku had been sold without a replacement secured. The British-Iranian billionaire replied: \u201cWith Romelu I wasted two summers trying to keep him. The first summer I spent three months with his agent, him, his mother and his family and we managed to keep him for another year. \u201cThen, last summer, we offered him a better deal than Chelsea. Whatever they offered we matched but he just didn\u2019t want to stay. He wanted to play for Chelsea at that time. \u201cI can assure you we tried everything to keep Rom. If I tell you what we offered him you wouldn\u2019t believe it. We offered him a better deal than Chelsea and his agent came to Finch Farm to sign the contract. Robert [Elstone, Everton\u2019s chief executive] was there, everything was in place, there were a few reporters outside, then in the meeting Rom called his mother. He said he was on a pilgrimage in Africa or somewhere and he had a voodoo and he got the message that he needs to go to Chelsea. \u201cI got close to Rom, I like the boy, he\u2019s a good boy, and I used all my charm to keep him and I flatly failed. This is unfortunately the world. Ultimately we lost money. To buy Rom now would be \u00a3120m. The issue was his brain had gone. He was in LA and he wouldn\u2019t come back. It happens. Alex Ferguson got another year out of [Cristiano] Ronaldo but then he was off. [Luis] Su\u00e1rez had to bite a few players to get off.\u201d Following the general meeting at which Elstone announced that good progress had been made on Everton\u2019s proposed move to the Liverpool waterfront, Kenwright admitted the cost was now \u00a3500m. \u201cHalf a billion is the estimate,\u201d the Everton chairman said. \u201cHalf a billion is what we are dealing with.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
