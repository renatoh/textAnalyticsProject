The new season is only 90 minutes old and already Joey Barton has been involved in a training ground bust-up, Steven Taylor has described his employers as \"a joke\" and Steve Harper has received a kick to the head from his own centre-forward. The last of these was unintentional, but accidents seem to keep happening to Newcastle. St James' Park has resembled a car crash for the past 12 months and, according to Kevin Nolan, the football world has enjoyed surveying the wreckage, with the midfielder claiming that those tuning in on Saturday night were doing so in the hope that West Bromwich Albion would inflict more damage. \"The first game was always going to be tough,\" said Nolan, who set up Damien Duff's deserved second-half equaliser. \"All eyes were on us, not just in Newcastle but across the country, hoping for another slip up. But I thought the lads handled that really well. \"Ever since I've come to this club I've realised a lot of people are out to get us,\" continued the former Bolton player. \"If there is anything strange or bad that happens it seems to go everywhere. It's been tough. Some of the things said and written have been hard to take. You read things about the lads that you know aren't true, but we have stuck together and tried to focus on what we can do on the pitch.\" Off the field things remain as uncertain as ever, not that Newcastle's players will be taking any notice of the fresh speculation. \"To be honest, we don't even listen to it anymore,\" Nolan said. \"You get sick of hearing this time it's going to happen.\" The supporters chanted Alan Shearer's name here and the club's owner, Mike Ashley, also got a mention from the travelling contingent, although \"you fat cockney bastard, get out of our club\" was not quite so complimentary. Barton, somewhat surprisingly, was welcomed on to the pitch despite the fact that his latest altercation, which prompted Chris Hughton, the caretaker manager, to drop him, raises further questions about his future. A few others would appear to have a big part to play this season. Alan Smith, who made only four Premier League starts in 2008-09, was excellent in the midfield holding role, while Duff, whose own goal at Villa Park condemned Newcastle to the Championship, impressed on the flank. It was Tim Krul, though, who really caught the eye, with the Dutchman producing four excellent second-half saves after replacing Harper at the interval to deny Roberto Di Matteo a winning start. Albion's lead had arrived six minutes before the break when Shelton Martis prodded over the line after Shola Ameobi's boot crashed into Harper's face. Newcastle might have imploded at that point but there was a marked improvement in the second half and Duff's controlled finish earned a merited point. \"Newcastle have had a really rocky time in every aspect,\" said Albion's Jonas Olsson, who had a goal disallowed for offside deep into stoppage time. \"But you sense they have the players to turn things around.\" Man of the match Tim Krul (Newcastle)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
