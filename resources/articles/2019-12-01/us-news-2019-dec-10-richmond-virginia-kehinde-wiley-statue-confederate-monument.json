Though like many of the Confederate statues and memorials it features a martial-looking man riding a horse, Rumors of War by Kehinde Wiley is a very different piece of art. The enormous statue outside the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA) in Richmond is almost three storeys tall. The rider sports dreadlocks and wears a hoodie. According to the museum, the sculpture is a direct response to the Confederate statues that line Monument Avenue just a few blocks away. Wiley, a Los Angeles native based in New York, was inspired by a visit to Richmond in 2016, for an exhibition of his work at the VMFA. The result was a re-imagination of a statue of the Confederate general Jeb Stuart, created by Frederick Moynihan in 1907. \u201cIn these toxic times, art can help us transform and give us a sense of purpose,\u201d the 42-year-old artist said in a statement before the unveiling. \u201cThis story begins with my seeing the Confederate monuments. What does it feel like if you are black and walking beneath this? We come from a beautiful, fractured situation. Let\u2019s take these fractured pieces and put them back together.\u201d Najee Wilson, Wiley\u2019s model, spoke to students at Binford Middle School in Richmond on Tuesday about how the two men met. \u201cMy message was simply, \u2018Hi Kehinde, my name is Najee Wilson and I\u2019m a fine arts muse with much experience. I\u2019d love to work with you someday,\u2019\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Yes, what\u2019s your email?\u2019 \u201cBeing a black man from South Carolina \u2013 being the figure that\u2019s on the horse \u2013 it\u2019s deeply moving, and it\u2019s deeply profound.\u201d Rumors of War was shown in Times Square, New York, before moving south. It now stands just a mile from Moynihan\u2019s original on Monument Avenue, which is adjacent to the most significant piece in Richmond, the Robert E Lee Monument created by the French sculptor Antonin Merci\u00e9. Since 2015, the Southern Poverty Law Center estimates that at least 114 Confederate symbols have been removed from their plinths and resting places across the US. The first was taken down in New Orleans as a response to a shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015. Nine black congregants were killed by Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who was pictured posing with a Confederate flag. He was sentenced to death in 2017. In June this year, the New York Times reported that some Confederate statues have been auctioned. A Robert E Lee statue removed in Dallas, Texas, sold for $1.4m. Other figures cannot be sold as they are too damaged. Last week a Confederate monument in Nashville was vandalized, the words \u201cThey were racists\u201d spray-painted across it. Wiley\u2019s statue now lives in the shadow of the United Daughters of the Confederacy\u2019s Memorial Building, with its grand bronze doors and double cannon. According to Newsweek, the UDC was responsible for commissioning and funding most of the Confederate statues in the south over the past century \u2013 as well as many recent attempts to obtain custody of unwanted statues such as \u201cSilent Sam\u201d, which was also removed in 2018 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In a settlement last month, the North Carolina Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans obtained the rights to the Silent Sam statue along with $2.5m from the university to ensure its preservation. At the VMFA ticket counter on Monday, an employee said the public response to Rumors of War had been positive. \u201cNinety percent good,\u201d the young black man said. The other 10%, he addedm consisted of negative emails and phone calls. The next day, on a rainy afternoon, hundreds turned out to witness the formal unveiling. Marching bands, dance troops and dozens of schools attended the event, which was also live-streamed. Wearing an African print suit, Wiley said he felt overwhelmed. The statue, he said, was \u201cnot just for Richmond but everyone in the United States of America.\u201d Recalling his visit in 2016, he said that when he saw the figures on Monument Avenue, he thought: \u201cWe can do better.\u201d In conclusion, he said: \u201cThis is every artist\u2019s dream.\u201d The title of his statue alludes to Jesus\u2019s speech from Matthew 24:6. \u201cYou will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
