When Gareth Thomas, playing Roj Blake, left after two years, Avon became the main character. He was a terse, cold pragmatist with a fine line in purred cynicism, and beneath his steely eyes and inscrutable visage Darrow imbued the character with a quick, calculating intelligence and simmering danger. He considered Avon to be a cross between Steve McQueen and Elvis Presley, with a touch of Richard Nixon thrown in. It was a captivating performance, never dull, and Darrow\u2019s smouldering good looks and gift for icy put-downs made Avon hugely popular with viewers and a bona fide science fiction icon. The series ended with the shocking deaths of all the lead characters (including Blake, returning for one last episode), with Avon the last man standing. The show\u2019s final shot was a closeup of Darrow, gun raised, grinning down the barrel of the camera (and several Federation rifles). Gunshots sounded over the closing titles. Darrow enthusiastically reprised the role when Blake\u2019s 7 was revived on audio by both the BBC (1998-99) and Big Finish (2012-19). He wrote a novel, Avon: A Terrible Aspect (1989), and even tried to acquire the rights to continue the screen incarnation of the series. He was born in Chessington, Surrey, as Paul Birkby, the son of a pharmacist, Val Birkby, and his wife, Gwen (nee Thomas). After a peripatetic postwar childhood he settled with his parents in Mill Hill East, north London, and was educated at the Haberdashers\u2019 Aske\u2019s Hampstead school before enrolling at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. When he graduated in 1962 an agent convinced him that his name was not actorly enough, so his father suggested Darrow, after the great American attorney Clarence Darrow. His theatrical career began in repertory in Cheltenham in 1962; he toured in Chips with Everything in 1963 and then spent a year at York Theatre Royal, where he became engaged to a fellow actor, Janet Lees-Price, whom he married in 1966. Other stage roles included the title role in Alfie (Northampton repertory theatre, 1965), Jimmy Porter in Look Back in Anger (1968, York Theatre Royal, then a tour of the Netherlands), Rocky in The Iceman Cometh (Bristol Old Vic, 1971) and Detective Sergeant Trotter in The Mousetrap (Ambassadors theatre, 1972). After Blake\u2019s 7 he was in the West End for Ray Cooney\u2019s Run For Your Wife (Criterion theatre, 1985-87), played Presley for Bill Kenwright in Alan Bleasdale\u2019s Are You Lonesome Tonight? (tour, 1987-88), the title role in Macbeth (tour, 1992) and Captain Vimes in Terry Pratchett\u2019s Guards! Guards! (tour, 1998-99). Having made his television debut in 1963, he played the dashing young doctor Simon Verity in Emergency - Ward 10 (1965-66); by happy coincidence, Janet also landed a regular role in the show at the same time. As well as playing guest parts in many popular dramas in the 1960s and 70s, he took the title role in The Poisoning of Charles Bravo (1975) and was the Sheriff of Nottingham in The Legend of Robin Hood (1975) before being cast as Avon in 1977. When Blake\u2019s 7 ended he delivered a superb turn as James Carker in the BBC\u2019s Dombey and Son (1983), entertainingly chewed the scenery in the Doctor Who adventure Timelash (1985), and was a regular in Making News (1990) and The Strangerers (2000). Darrow played judges in both Hollyoaks (2002) and Law and Order (2009-14), had two short stints in Emmerdale (1991-92, 2009), did comic turns for Little Britain (2004) and Toast of London (2014), and hosted the athletic endurance series Hercules (2004). He lent his distinctive tones to numerous commercials and video games, and was the voice of the Oxfordshire radio station Jack FM for more than a decade, providing jingles and promotional inserts. In 2014 he suffered an aortic aneurysm that led to the partial amputation of both legs, but he responded with trademark good humour, persevering with his hugely entertaining turns at science fiction conventions. His last television appearance was with his old friend and Blake\u2019s 7 co-star Michael Keating on an episode of Pointless Celebrities in 2018. He published an autobiography, You\u2019re Him, Aren\u2019t You?, in 2006. Janet died in 2012. \u2022 Paul Darrow (Paul Valentine Birkby), actor, born 2 May 1941; died 3 June 2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
