There is, however, one British company that is doing all it can to change this. With three chalets in Morzine and others in Serre Chevalier, Tignes, Chamonix and now Whistler, Snowboardlodge believes it offers boarders the perfect package: the chance to go riding with like-minds, shepherded by a team of guides who know where the best runs are on the day. The walkie-talkies they hand out make meeting up for lunch as easy as pressing a button. Nowhere can this service be more valuable than in Morzine, where we spent a week at Snowboardlodge's Chalet Philippe, which takes 14 guests. At the budget end of the market, Chalet Philippe may not be five-star material, but there's a young, unstuffy and very snowboardish feel about it, especially around the dinner table at night with a log crackling in the fire. The rooms are basic, the food is straightforward and the wine is passable and plentiful. And, should you fancy it, you can attend a 'klinik' in the basement and learn how to wax your board and sharpen your edges. For \u00a310 a day, you can also sign up for the Salomon test centre scheme, which allows you to chop and change between various types of board, kit and stance. As a nice touch, hanging on the workshop wall is the first snowboard ever used in Avoriaz. The most unstreamlined chunk of wood imaginable, it looks like an instrument of torture. It probably was. \u00b7 Snowboardlodge (08700 111360, snowboardlodge.co.uk) prices start at \u00a3249 for a week including flights from Gatwick and transfer from Geneva to Morzine. Supplement for flights from Edinburgh and Glasgow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
