Can you name Liverpool's assistant manager? No marks for just mumbling something vaguely Spanish like Javier-Lopes-Garcia-Jorge. In an age when even your mum has access to live Lithuanian Super League on Eurosport 3, the obscure foreign fitness expert/pilates guru is football's last unexplored frontier. And no Christmas tree could be complete without six frowning blokes sitting beneath it, all with identical tracksuits and a degree in Twister from the University of Magaluf. Thierry Henry doing something uncool Who doesn't love Thierry Henry? He's so clever. And charming. And handsome. If only, just for Christmas, he could do something embarrassing. Like accidentally calling his primary school teacher \"mum\" while breaking wind in a lift without realising someone is standing behind him and simultaneously sneezing and eating soup so it comes out of his nose. I think we'd all feel much merrier. An embargo on the word \"quality\" The crafty pundit's way of saying one thing is slightly better than another - and making it sound as though they've, like, really thought about it. As in \"He's got great quality\" or \"The difference between the sides is quality in wide areas, quality at set pieces\". Substitute the word \"marzipan\" for \"quality\" and you're left with something that makes about the same amount of sense. Stop this lip-reading farce This Christmas I want a blanket Fifa ban on linesmen covering their mouths with their hands while speaking to the referee. It's not 1967. You're not being wire-tapped by the FBI. Nobody has you placed at the centre of a plot to assassinate Richard Nixon. Also, no more nervous, matey laughter while being abused by a narrowly-flagged centre forward. The knees-high sprint to the halfway line will suffice. The return of really bad players Not that there aren't plenty of bad footballers available. You can probably buy them in Woolworths along with your giant Quality Street tin and bottle of Maltese crusted port-style fortified wine. They're just bad in the wrong way, like not trying very hard or expending most of their energy making sure they have an intricate haircut. The club-footed player who runs around with the crazed energy of a toddler on four litres of Irn-Bru is on his way out - replaced by a sulky Uruguayan who hasn't scored since March but can still pull off the odd nonchalant, behind-the-knee kangaroo kick. And where's the fun in that? More coaching badges Coaching badges - what a stocking filler. But why stop at laying out cones and carrying the big string bag of balls. How about a four-stage written exam governing use of the phrases \"mind games\", \"down to the bare bones\" or \"we've set ourselves a 40-point target and anything after that is a bonus\". In fact why stop at managers? Fans wishing to shout phrases like \"Close him down/work the channels/send it to feet\" could face a six-hour tactical grilling by a panel led by G\u00e9rard Houllier and Noam Chomsky. Merry Christmas! Now please stop talking about the 4-5-1 formation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
