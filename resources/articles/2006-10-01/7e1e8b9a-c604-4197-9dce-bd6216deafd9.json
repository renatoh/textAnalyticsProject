I had watched him on television but had never seen him playing in the flesh, so I was realising a dream when I went to watch him in action at the Grove on Friday. What struck me was the sheer focus on the man. The thousands of spectators were there only to follow him; the other players, poor things, had perhaps a few dozen watching them. And I was surprised by his physique. It is superb, well sculpted; he has the fitness of a true sportsman, whereas some of his fellow competitors appear to be relying more on technique. He has achieved a level of consistency others can only dream of, although maybe Roger Federer comes close. But this is not a sport where doping can have an effect on performance, so you have to look at strength of mind. There is a certain purity to it - everyone starts at the same place and finishes at the same place, and there are few outside factors that can alter performance in the way that, say, the car can in formula one, or the bike can in cycling. In other sports there is always someone you can blame - the referee, the other players, the weather, the trainer. I don't think there are many excuses in golf. You either have it or you don't. I am a recent convert. As a boy I did not follow golf closely because in my part of France it was seen as a pastime for the relatively well-off. But the key thing was that I was a sports fan, un passionn\u00e9, and I have remained one even though it is how I earn a living. In my view, if you cannot appreciate other sports you are not a real sportsman. When I was young I ran, played tennis, volleyball and basketball - I realised the limitations of my height in that game pretty soon - and it happened that I turned out best at rugby. Perhaps I should have tried golf. I would have had fewer injuries for sure. The difference between team and individual sports is always fascinating. When you come to a sport such as golf from rugby you are hit by the fact that it is all down to the one person out there. Woods does not seem to show emotion and there are few smiles - in fact I doubt if there are many ways of expressing feelings in golf apart from hitting the caddie, and Woods's caddie looked a bit too big and strong for that. In a team sport such as rugby you can hide in the collective if you are having a bad day, but then again if the team is bad it does not matter how good you are. What struck me with Woods is that in his sport he has to be at his best all the time. The emotions must be incredible for the guy on top, but Woods's greatness must frustrate his fellow competitiors. In rugby a winning team can have five stars, five OK players and five so-so ones and the attention will be shared out, but in golf the 50th player in the world can be performing at a very high level but will never get any visibility if Woods is there. He is an example to any sportsman in the search for perfection, quality of performance and consistency, and there are lessons any of us can learn from him in the way he concentrates on a single objective, his application to the task, and the way he delivers when everyone expects him to do so. Psychologically the pressure must be enormous, week in, week out, yet he still delivers. I can see him needing to take time out at some point during his career simply to escape. There were 5,000 people at the Grove watching him hit the ball - most normal human beings would have a few beads of sweat on their foreheads, but not Woods. There are lessons, I suppose, for France in next year's World Cup, in the way he is able to stay focused on his game in spite of the weight of expectation, but the experience of watching the Tiger on the hunt is one that will stay with me beyond that date. I would love some of what he has got to rub off on me."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
