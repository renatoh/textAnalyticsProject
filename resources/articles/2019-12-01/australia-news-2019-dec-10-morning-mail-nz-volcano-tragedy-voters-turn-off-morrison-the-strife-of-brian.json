Recommended reads How tourists became first aiders on seas off the White Island volcano. Eleanor Ainge Roy writes: \u201cJust off the volcanic White Island, or Whakaari, a boatload of tourists who had been standing at the crater about 20 minutes earlier watched in surprise, and then horror. \u2018It was hard to tell at first, because we\u2019d seen the smoke before, but this was a huge cloud of it,\u2019 said Michael Schade, who was visiting the island with his parents. \u2018We were taking photos and videos and then it dawned on us what had happened.\u2019\u201d The Coalition isn\u2019t being honest about the climate crisis, writes Greg Jericho. But neither is Labor. \u201cOf course we do need to think about those who will be affected by mine closures, but cripes, there is no pressure, no impetus and no real commitment from the ALP right now on an issue that is causing children and elderly to have to stay inside because of worries about air quality.
