Scrapping the Harriers is expected to release \u00a3900m between now and 2018, which will be spent on RAF Tornado and Typhoon jets, and the US Joint Strike Fighter, whose cost is rising rapidly, the MoD said. Two Harrier aircraft will also be offered to museums in order \"to preserve the Royal Navy's military heritage\", it added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
