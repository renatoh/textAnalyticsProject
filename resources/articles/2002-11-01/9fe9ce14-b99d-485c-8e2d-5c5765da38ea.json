She then postponed retirement in favour of a professional contract with the champions-elect. Given that she was the only player to have declined, on moral grounds, when first approached nearly three years earlier, her move from Arsenal seemed all the more significant. But since then things have changed. Last season Arsenal's defeat by Fulham in the League Cup was hailed as symbolic of a shift in power in the game. Last week the two met with much less fuss (and without Spacey, injured for most of the season), and when the Fulham bench arose after a 2-1 victory to punch the air, all they had really won was a competitive match in an increasingly competitive league. It was, said Fulham's manager Gaute Haugenes, his side's \"best game of the season\", although the view from the Arsenal dugout was different. \"We didn't perform,\" said Vic Akers, \"and they didn't look a lot better.\" In any case, possibly the biggest consequence of Spacey's crossing the floor did not really make her presence felt until yesterday when Ellen Maggs was credited with two goals in Arsenal's 3-0 League Cup win over Leeds . The talent of Maggs - a first-team regular since Spacey's exit - has long been known to connoisseurs, certainly to anyone who saw her pace and grace at the Under-19 World Cup in Canada. This season, says Akers, the little forward - she wears size three boots, her socks come up over her knees and her shorts go down almost below them - has been \"fantastic\". Now she has received her first senior England call-up for the second leg of the World Cup play-off final against France on Saturday. Defeat in St-Etienne would mean no England at the finals in China next year but Hope Powell's team now know they have already qualified for the 2005 European Championship - England have been named as hosts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
