I was a rehabilitation worker at Portland young offenders institute; now I'm working nationally. I have special responsibility for race and diversity, reporting back to prison service headquarters. It's good for my career, but also it's an area I feel isn't given high enough priority. In a sense I feel more valued because I have a managerial role and when you are on the frontline you can feel that nobody notices what you're doing. But I do miss the hands-on side, although I still keep in contact with some of the boys I worked with. My salary has gone up, but I'd love some more. I could go back into education and earn more, so I suppose I have to say that other things are more important. That sense of duty is still my main motivation. It's not the sort of job you could do if you didn't believe in it. Obviously, conditions are a lot better because I now work from home rather than in a horrible, smelly office at the back of the wing. The most difficult part is the amount of travelling; I'm away from home 15 days a month. I'm a single mother and have two children so that can be very difficult, but I knew that was the case when I took the job. To some extent it's the nature of the work, but the directorate is going through a big reorganisation and the idea is to cut down on travelling for everybody. The major problem facing us is overcrowding. Everyone accepts that. Releasing staff for training is difficult; prisoners are being moved around the country away from their families. It's made life more difficult for everyone in the prison sevice. Public voices: March 21 2002 Rehabilitation worker, Portland young offenders institute, Dorset Salary: \u00a320,000 This time last year it was all looking like doom and gloom, because our funding was due to run out. But we've actually been very well-funded now and have taken on another full-time and another part-time member of staff. We're chuffed to bits. We've got money from Comic Relief, the prison, the Weavers Trust Fund and the Monument Trust, the original funders. We're also working with young offenders now - 18 to 21 year olds - because the Youth Justice Board is removing the 15 to 18 year olds from Portland at the end of March. A report came out showing that with the lads we had worked with, who are the most likely to reoffend, we had reduced the reoffending rate from 90% to approximately 40%. The project's been picked up by people as an example of good practice and it's important that people are recognising the issues - sticking a lad in prison for years and then throwing him out on the street without doing anything in between isn't going to help. Sometimes you can get swallowed up in a day when two or three boys come back to prison and you don't feel you've achieved anything. When you look at the report you see the bigger picture; I probably do feel a bit more valued now. In general terms there seems to be more recognition now of the fact that people in the public sector do hard work and the salaries just don't compare to the private sector. The Common Good: March 21 2001 Rehabilitation worker, Portland young offenders institute, Dorset Salary: \u00a320,000 You get a tremendous feeling of satisfaction when boys start to open up to you and face their real problems. That's what makes it worth going to work - you feel you are doing something important for them and may have some effect on someone's life. I started work as the project manager in January, working with 15- to 18-year-olds towards the end of their sentence. I look at what sort of problems they face when they get outside - jobs, relationships with families - and what we can do about that. When they come out we keep in touch for as long as they want us to. I started off as a teacher in a mainstream school and then worked with excluded kids. Then a job came up in prison education and it seemed to be the same kids who had moved along and no one had helped them much. I realised with this project I could do something constructive to help them. So many are committed to change in prison - but as soon as they walk out they have nowhere to go. Then we wonder why they go back to crime. We are failing these lads. We're expecting them to go out and become law abiding citizens when they cannot even put food in their mouths. One of the only frustrations is that we cannot take on all the boys because there are only two of us. You never like to say no, especially when they're really committed to changing. The funding for the project also runs out at the end of the year, so we're trying to find new funding. People say nice things about us, but we need the money. That's always the problem when you work for a charity [the National Association for the Care and Rehabilitation of Offenders]. I'm paid just under \u00a320,000 a year and I'm quite happy. I dealt with it a long time ago. It's seen as a vocation and people think that's your motivation so you don't need money as well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
