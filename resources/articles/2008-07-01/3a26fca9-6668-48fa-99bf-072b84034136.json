After seven years as the rector of the University of the Arts, in September, the former permanent secretary at the Department for Education and Employment starts his job as director of the Institute for Government, a new thinktank for senior officials and politicians. \"I still have a passionate interest and public sector reform and civil service reform,\" he says. And despite the day job at the university, Bichard found himself frequently sought out by officials. The institute will provide \"effective support\" \u2013 by which Bichard means mentoring, tutoring, workshops and seminars \u2013 to politicians and the most senior officials. The job seems like a somewhat backward step, especially for someone who had at one point been tipped to be cabinet secretary. Bichard started out in local government after a degree in law, because he couldn't afford to practice. So he leapt at the chance when the county borough of Reading as it then was offered him a job as an articled clerk and paid for him to qualify. From there, Bichard went to Berkshire county council and then to the London borough of Lambeth, before joining Brent as one of the youngest local authority chief executives at 32. A politically fraught six years, it was a \"complete relief\" to go to Gloucestershire in 1986. Bichard still spends a lot of time there. A keen garden designer, he has started applying his skills indoors and has just finished designing a house in Gloucestershire. Bichard moved to the Benefits Agency in 1990, which he says taught him a lot about the senior civil service and was a good preparation for when he became permanent secretary at the then Department for Education, which became the Department for Education and Employment. What did he enjoy most about his time in central and local government? \"I suppose the most satisfying time of my career probably was the four years after the 1997 election. I was responsible for the New Deal, for numeracy, literacy, schools, for lifelong learning, for all of things were absolutely at the centre of what the government's priorities were.\" Discreet Humorous and outgoing, Bichard is discreet, for example about the position of cabinet secretary in succession to Sir Richard Wilson; his enthusiasm for civil service reform seemed to chime with Tony Blair's priorities. \"I never applied for the job, because that's not how things work.\" He goes on: \"I've always wanted to do different things and I've not been driven by singular ambition to be something. I don't think I've missed out.\" Why did he leave the civil service? \"I decided in 2001 I didn't want to go to another department and that it was probably time to do something different.\" So he came to the London Institute, which became the University of the Arts in 2004. \"I developed a completely new career. I've got a new set of friends and a circle of interests. The fact that I can now say Jimmy Choo is a friend is just wonderful.\" What else has he gained from life outside the civil service? \"I'm not as quick to anger as I used to be. Running a university, especially a creative arts university has taught me quite a lot, made me a better listener,\" he says. Leave the job, he says, with a sense of energy and fun. \"I would never want someone to come into my organisation and say this is a grey place.\" Working better Bichard hopes the institute will help the civil service and government work better. It's about how you make policy making more effective, innovative and creative, yet remain accountable. Bichard is critical of performance management. \"My own view of public service agreements was that they were too superficial. In the DfEE they were being produced as another set of overarching targets that were initially not measurable. At the time they were a bit of a distraction.\" He also questions whether those who set targets are qualified to do so. \"If you get people setting targets with no experience of operational delivery, you're not going to get the right sort of targets.\" Perhaps unsurprisingly, given his role as chair of the Design Council \u2013 the only other position he is keeping on other than the institute, Bichard says public sector reform will always be stymied by poor design. \"We invest money in poorly designed services, so we get some improvement but we don't get the kind of transformation that politicians, citizens and clients want.\" \u00b7 This article appears in this month's edition of the Guardian's Public magazine"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
