Last week, the National Sound Library of Mexico unearthed what it said could be audio of Kahlo reading from her essay portraying her husband, the fellow artist Diego Rivera. The recording, made for the 1955 radio show El Bachiller, aired a year after Kahlo died in 1954. In the clip, a female voice is heard describing Rivera as resembling an \u201cenormous, immense child with a friendly face and a sad gaze\u201d. The problem, according to Kahlo\u2019s descendants, is that the voice is not hers. \u201cAs far as Kahlo family knows, there are no records of Frida\u2019s voice,\u201d they said in a statement. They also pointed out that one of the artist\u2019s students, Arturo Estrada Hern\u00e1ndez, had also said the voice on the recording was not Kahlo\u2019s. Another former student, Guillermo Monroy Becerril \u2013 who remembers his friend and teacher as \u201ca dazzling, optimistic woman dedicated to painting\u201d \u2013 said he did not recognise the voice either. Monroy told the Spanish news agency Efe he and his friends had practically lived with Kahlo at the Casa Azul, her family home in Mexico City. \u201cThe thing is, I don\u2019t recognise the voice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time I met her, I noticed she was a woman with a very sweet, cheerful voice \u2026 Frida\u2019s real voice was very lively, charming, and cheery. It wasn\u2019t serious or smooth or delicate \u2026 it was crystal clear.\u201d A Mexican actor believes the recording is actually of her voice, and was made in 1953 or 1954. Amparo Garrido, who gave the voice to Snow White when Disney\u2019s 1937 film was dubbed into Spanish in the 1960s, told the Mexican radio station Radio F\u00f3rmula: \u201cI feel it\u2019s me and have for a while. I recorded various things for El Bachiller \u2026 I\u2019m almost absolutely sure that I recorded this one.\u201d Garrido\u2019s children also say they recognised their mother\u2019s voice in the clip. One of them, Ismael, has said he doubts Kahlo would have been well enough to record the reading. \u201cFrida Kahlo was born in 1907, she died in 1954, and this audio is meant to be from 65 years ago \u2013 so it has to be from the year she died,\u201d he told the station. \u201cThat makes things difficult, because in 1954, she was in hospital practically the whole time. And besides, the voice is rather an affected one.\u201d P\u00e1vel Granados, the head of the National Sound Library, said Kahlo\u2019s voice was the \u201cmost requested and sought-after\u201d by visitors. \u201cUntil now, there had never been a recording of Frida Kahlo,\u201d he said last week. \u201cFrida\u2019s voice has always been a great enigma, a never-ending search.\u201d The library\u2019s role is to preserve and make public documentary sound archives for Mexico. Its collection, amassed over a decade, features the voices of some of the country\u2019s most important historical figures."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
