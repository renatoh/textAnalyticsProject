Last night he completed a medical on Tyneside and opted to head to the north-east rather than follow up West Ham United's interest. He signed a five-year deal, believed to be worth \u00a370,000 a week in wages, and should soon be joined at St James' by the Middlesbrough striker Mark Viduka. West Ham still harboured faint hopes of hijacking the deal last night but Newcastle remained confident that they would not be gazumped at the end of a day that began with Viduka, out of contract at Middlesbrough, assuring Allardyce that he had decided \"in principle\" to swap Teesside for Tyneside. The deal will not be formalised until the Australian international's return to England from holiday abroad but sources close to him insisted yesterday that he would \"definitely not\" change his mind despite being coveted by Birmingham City, Portsmouth, West Ham and the Italian club Genoa. Barton seems to have long had his heart set on joining Newcastle and spent the early part of the afternoon in discussions with Allardyce at the club's training ground before leaving for his medical with Derek Wright, Newcastle's chief physiotherapist. Meanwhile Willie McKay, Barton's agent, was at St James' Park negotiating personal terms on behalf of his client. Those talks are believed to have included the possible insertion of a clause in Barton's contract dictating that Newcastle would be financially protected in the event of his being sent to prison this year. The midfielder is on police bail after an alleged assault on his City team-mate Ousmane Dabo. With Dabo apparently determined to press charges, the matter could reach court in the autumn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
