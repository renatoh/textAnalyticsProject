The plan by Alistair Darling, the work and pensions secretary, and endorsed by Tony Blair, is still causing a furore among Labour backbenchers. However, many disability groups claim the government is spinning the reality to attract rightwing support. The Disability Rights Consortium yesterday wrote to the prime minister demanding an urgent meeting. Scope, a leading disability group, pointed out that during the passage of the welfare bill in April 1999, the then disability minister Hugh Bayley told MPs that doctors, on behalf of the benefits agency, were required to specify one of five intervals between subsequent tests for all claimants. The intervals ranged from three to 18 months. Mr Bayley stressed: \"Following the initial application of the all-work test, claims are already kept under regular review to confirm that entitlement to benefit continues. To achieve that, they may have to be retested from time to time.\" During the passage of the welfare bill, the government strengthened its powers to require benefit reassessment, so that tests could occur even if there was no obvious change in the claimant's conditions. A Department of Work and Pensions spokeswoman conceded that the proposed three-year regime set out by Mr Darling this week would mean less frequent checks than recommended at present. Downing Street also conceded that \"some checks take place at present, but they are random, not systematic and do not do enough to see if someone could be available for work\". In the Commons on Wednesday Mr Blair claimed some incapacity benefit claimants were left unchecked for 20 years. The GMB union, which represents many disabled workers, said the government could take the heat out of the issue by guaranteeing that the severely disabled would not be subject to retests. This broadly is the position at present."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
