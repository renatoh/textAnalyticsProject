Jordan Henderson was pressed into action in central defence after Matip failed to come out for the second half at Craven Cottage, with Klopp later confirming the 29-year-old had suffered a back spasm. It was the latest blow for the Reds, who revealed before kick-off that Diogo Jota would be out for at least six weeks because of a knee injury the striker suffered in the Champions League last Wednesday. On the field, Liverpool needed Mohamed Salah\u2019s penalty to rescue a point after they had fallen behind to a goal from Bobby Decordova-Reid in the first half, with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Tottenham still ahead in the table on goal difference after their 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace. Liverpool have not lost a league match at Anfield since April 2017 but, asked if there was a worse time to be facing the deadly Spurs duo Harry Kane and Son Heung-min given his lack of defensive cover, Klopp said: \u201cProbably not. But we aren\u2019t struggling with numbers at centre-back \u2013 it\u2019s just now they are getting younger and younger. Today we tried with Hendo so it\u2019s situations like this. You have to find the solution but that is how football is.\u201d On Matip\u2019s chances of facing Spurs, he added: \u201cWe will see. He will get treatment so I think he has a chance.\u201d Liverpool could easily have found themselves further behind after a poor start and Klopp said the congested calendar is catching up with his players. \u201cWe are dealing with human beings and things like this happen. Yesterday all the teams that played in the Champions League had a tough one. It\u2019s crazy. Maybe this was the weekend we felt it a little bit. In the first 30 minutes we were just not good. We could have lost the game in that period.\u201d Henderson, the captain, added: \u201cWe didn\u2019t get going until after the first 30 minutes. You can\u2019t do that in the Premier League or you get punished \u2013 like we did. The good thing is we reacted well. We dominated and should have scored one or two more. I\u2019m disappointed with the start, pleased with the reaction.\u201d Scott Parker acknowledged his Fulham team felt disappointed despite holding the champions to a draw. \u201cIn the last three games, against Leicester, Manchester City and Liverpool, I don\u2019t think anyone would have given us a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got four points that people wouldn\u2019t have believed. We came out of the blocks flying today. We showed our quality. We can play.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
