But at last week\u2019s autumn/winter shows in Paris \u2013 as medieval gown followed woodland warrior dress \u2013 the Westeros influence seemed difficult to deny. At Atelier Versace, models wore floral headbands and glistened in slinky chainmail. At Elie Saab, there were sharp-shouldered frocks fit for Cersei, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, paired with chunky gold jewellery that glittered like a Stark family heirloom. At Dior, diaphanous dresses and monk-like tunics were styled with linked-metal tank tops. Meanwhile, \u201clook 2\u201d at Valentino \u2013 a floor-length velvet cape \u2013 was exactly what a Game of Thrones heroine would wrap over her shoulders while making a night-time escape. Even at Schiaparelli \u2013 where the clothes on the catwalk were more Wallis Simpson than Daenerys Targaryen \u2013 Carice van Houten, who plays the terrifying Melisandre, was sitting in the front row. According to Van Houten, what\u2019s happening is more complicated than designers simply copying the show. \u201cThe original costume designer,\u201d she says, referring to Michele Clapton, who left at the end of the current series, \u201cis a very talented, interesting woman and might have influenced certain designers, but she was also inspired by them. It\u2019s a two-way thing.\u201d \u201cI really think there\u2019s something deeper going on which parallels the dystopian times we are living through,\u201d says US Vogue contributing editor Sarah Mower, who is so captivated by GoT that she is chairing a talk on the subject next month at the Port Eliot festival. \u201cThe unbelievable brutality and horror on our screens, beheadings, slavery, maltreatment of the poor, religious fanaticism \u2013 is often described as \u2018medieval\u2019 behaviour,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it\u2019s no wonder fashion is somehow pointing to the fear that we\u2019re plunging into a new dark age.\u201d Mower is one of many influential Game of Thrones fans in the fashion world. Designer Giles Deacon, for example, is the real-life partner of Gwendoline Christie, who plays super-tough Brienne of Tarth; the pair are friends with super-stylist Katie Grand and designer Katie Hillier. Little wonder that there are a lot of Game of Thrones conversations taking place on the front row, according to Justin O\u2019Shea, buying director of designer fashion retailer MyTheresa.com. He singles out the outfits of \u201cthe dragon queen\u201d, Targaryen, for particular praise: \u201cShe has basically coined a new red carpet look,\u201d he says. \u201cThe \u2018Khaleesi gown\u2019 \u2013 Alberta Ferretti meets Versace.\u201d Admittedly, fashion in Westeros \u2013 the land in which Game of Thrones is set \u2013 is a world away from the navy blue cashmere uniform that many fashion editors wear. It is a sumptuous, vaguely historical mash-up, all breastplates and battle furs, corseted crop tops and bell-sleeves worthy of the Lady of Shalott. It may be outlandish, but O\u2019Shea thinks its effects have already been seen in real life. \u201cGame of Thrones was part of my fall 2013 trend presentation,\u201d he says. \u201cJon Stark fur collars and big-hooded Victorian coats were all over the runways. I am a firm believer that the most influential TV series do impact the way people dress. Mad Men is a perfect example.\u201d Many others are more circumspect. Natalie Kingham, buying director at Matchesfashion.com, describes a \u201cslight influence\u201d next season in \u201cbell sleeves, floral scatter print and mid-length dresses and gowns\u201d. On the high street, where ravishing silk brocade is not usually an option, brands from Topshop to River Island said the look was unlikely to be a strong influence. Even at those haute couture shows that felt pure Lannister v Stark, the show was not explicitly named as a reference (Valentino\u2019s more official starting point was ancient Rome \u2013 \u201cmysterious, pagan and ecclesiastic\u201d). In fact, away from the show\u2019s most ardent admirers, the Game of Thrones effect is much less easily tracked than that of Mad Men \u2013 a more wearable kind of costume drama \u2013 which spawned a Banana Republic collection and was credited with a revolution in men\u2019s office dressing. But if concerns about looking as though you have got lost on the way to a medieval battle re-enactment are putting fashion fans off, there are ways to dip a toe in the Westeros look without going full dragon lady. Like wearing an Isabel Marant tabard top over an otherwise 21st-century outfit, or swapping your coat for a dramatic faux-fur wrap worthy of Brienne of Tarth. Certainly the ardent fans will spot the references, no matter how subtle \u2013 because they will be looking for them. Says O\u2019Shea: \u201cEven if us Game of Thrones fans are living in a slightly augmented reality, I am pretty happy being there.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
