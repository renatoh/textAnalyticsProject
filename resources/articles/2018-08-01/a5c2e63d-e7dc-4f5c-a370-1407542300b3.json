The Brazil No 1 enjoyed a comfortable Premier League debut on Sunday when rarely tested in the 4-0 defeat of West Ham. The speed and range of his passing was evident, however, and Van Dijk believes that will only improve Liverpool\u2019s attacking threat this season, while he and his fellow defenders have already benefited from Alisson\u2019s more commanding presence. The centre-back said: \u201cHe is very good. We speak a lot. He\u2019s very vocal and that helps. It helps me and everyone in the back-line. His presence is very good as well. He has a lot of qualities on the ball and that helps us playing. We\u2019ve worked on it the whole pre-season and we\u2019ll keep practising. There\u2019s still a lot to do.\u201d Liverpool have not conceded a Premier League goal at Anfield since Michail Antonio\u2019s consolation in West Ham\u2019s 4-1 defeat on 24 February. The defensive improvement since Van Dijk\u2019s \u00a375m move from Southampton, allied to Klopp\u2019s formidable attack, has heightened belief in a title challenge and the Dutch international insists there is more to come. \u201cIt was a very good performance, almost complete,\u201d he added of Sunday\u2019s victory. \u201cGood goals, maybe we should have scored a bit more. Clean sheet, we kept it tight. Something to build on. [But] it\u2019s just one game. We had a good pre-season with good results and games where we\u2019ve played very well but we can do a lot better and it\u2019s just the start. The key is we need to be very consistent and do it every game.\u201d The 27-year-old is acutely aware of the expectation on Liverpool this season and admits that, while expectation is shared within the dressing room, the focus remains on realising the team\u2019s vast potential in each game. \u201cThe most important thing is that we look at ourselves,\u201d he added. \u201cWe know that right now we have a great squad. Everyone who plays for Liverpool has a lot of quality. It\u2019s all about being consistent. We want to challenge for any competition but we must look at ourselves. Of course we want to challenge. I do not feel any pressure in that case but we play every game to win, that\u2019s how our mindset is. Against West Ham our focus was good and now we recover before focusing on Crystal Palace [for Monday], which is going to be a very tough game.\u201d Georginio Wijnaldum has said he relishes increased competition in Liverpool\u2019s midfield and never entertained the idea of leaving this summer. Wijnaldum was linked with a move to Turkey after Liverpool had spent over \u00a390m to add Naby Ke\u00efta and Fabinho to their central midfield options. But the 27-year-old insists he welcomes the inevitable pressure for places and was not responsible for the transfer speculation. \u201cI laughed about it,\u201d said the Dutchman, who carried his fine pre-season form into the victory over Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side at Anfield. \u201cI also read that I asked the club if I could leave. I never had a conversation with the club. People from the outside just see Liverpool is buying players, so players who are already here are going to leave. Liverpool will always buy good players, even if they already have good players. That\u2019s normal. \u201cI think it has to be normal for a club like Liverpool because that means you\u2019re a big club. But that was something from the media that I was going to Turkey. Maybe because Phillip Cocu is manager [of Fenerbahce] and I worked with him for two years. I don\u2019t know who put it in the media, but it wasn\u2019t me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
