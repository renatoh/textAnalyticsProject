Wong on Wednesday night local time declared American voters \u201cdeserve to have their voices heard\u201d. The Morrison government is yet to comment on Trump\u2019s pre-emptive victory declaration with the count still in progress, but Wong took to Twitter to argue democratic processes needed to run their course. \u201cAmericans have voted in historic numbers in this election,\u201d the Labor senator said. \u201cThey deserve to have their voices heard. The democratic process must be respected, even when it takes time. It\u2019s in Australia\u2019s interest that America remains a credible, stable democracy.\u201d While there was no official comment from the Coalition government, Liberal backbencher and former diplomat Dave Sharma expressed a similar view to Wong. \u201cAbove all else, being a democratic leader means respecting the verdict of the voters, the sanctity of the process, and facilitating a peaceful transfer of power when needed,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cPatience and humility are both necessary virtues\u201d. The former Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, also called for the count to continue. The Greens expressed concern about the extraordinary events that played out on Wednesday night Australia time. \u201cTrump is trying to steal the US election,\u201d said the Victorian senator Janet Rice. \u201cScott Morrison must not recognise Trump\u2019s premature claim of victory. Australia must wait until the voices of the American people are heard and stand by our democratic values\u201d. The alarm in Australia followed Trump telling reporters: \u201cWe were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.\u201d In a short statement just after 2am on Wednesday Washington time, Trump made a baseless allegation of electoral fraud and told reporters: \u201cWe want the law to be used in a proper manner, so we\u2019ll be going to the US supreme court.\u201d \u201cWe want all voting to stop. We don\u2019t want to find any ballots at four o\u2019clock in the morning and add those to the list. To me this is a very sad moment. We will win this, and as far as I\u2019m concerned we already have.\u201d The Biden campaign subsequently described Trump\u2019s intervention as \u201coutrageous, unprecedented and incorrect\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
