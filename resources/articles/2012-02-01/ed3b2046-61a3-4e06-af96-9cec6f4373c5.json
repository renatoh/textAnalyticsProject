Nobody likes a bully. So let's talk about the fate of the Occupy protesters at St Paul's and the suggestion, made here and in parliament by the Green MP Caroline Lucas, that the home secretary called the church authorities and said they needed to show quite a bit more lead in their pencil than had been the case. Looked bad \u2013 the government isn't supposed to go around bullying humble theologians. So when Lucas asked the question, ministers refused to answer. Officials had \"discussions with the cathedral authorities\" was all they would say. Well, with Occupy's eviction due for discussion on Wednesday at the high court, the truth will out. For officials will talk, and we now understand that the home secretary herself made clear her righteous anger to the then dean of St Paul's, Graeme Knowles \u2013 after which commenced the legal action. If he had lead in his pencil, he would have told her to get lost. The rest we know. \u2022 Shouldn't happen to a churchman. Shouldn't happen in a church. Church is where believers find the ability to come to terms with what has passed and the strength to confront future slights and challenges. One hopes Rupert Murdoch found that and more last Sunday, when seen at St Bride's, the journalists' church in Fleet Street. \u2022 William Hague, meanwhile, told Andrew Marr that the health service must be \"reformed to cope with the pressures of an ageing population\". And though none would deny those challenges, his blanket defence of Voldemort Lansley's reorganisation debacle did raise eyebrows. Reflecting Voldemort's lust for thinking the unthinkable, bosses at South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust plan drastic changes to maternity and paediatric services. You can't do that, say protesters. And the foreign secretary stands with them. Different when it's close to home, isn't it? \u2022 But what's the alternative? Adverse consequences occur when one doesn't appear to be looking out for the locals. Such as the prime minister, taking the family to the Roald Dahl museum in Buckinghamshire last weekend, and finding himself confronted by signs protesting about his apparent enthusiasm for the land-despoiling high-speed rail link. Such as locals pointing, and laughing, when he emerged from Dahl's Caf\u00e9 Twit. \u2022 Finally, what was it the combative Nadine Dorries MP said? \"I'm frequently gobsmacked by how journalists forget to check their facts.\" Lord Justice Leveson would concur. But then he would probably avoid making an idiot of himself in the aftermath. On Saturday, Dorries pointed her Twitter flock towards an article by our own Jonathan Freedland. It referred to the \"left's dirty secret\" \u2013 the extent to which leading figures embraced the idea of eugenics: the theme of the novel Pantheon, written under Freedland's pen name, Sam Bourne. \"Thanks to @j_freedland for excellent Cif article,\" tweeted Dorries, prompting a measure of criticism. \"Usual torrent of abuse 4 linking to an abortion article re the left,\" she said. It's not an \"abortion article\", countered Freedland. \"There's a difference between individual women having right to choose and desire to reduce/eliminate ranks of the 'inferior'.\" \"Yes, but as you know,\" said Dorries, \"abortion was the method used to eliminate the inferior.\" She had seen Freedland being interviewed on the BBC. \"I just found it odd that in the whole interview you avoided the word entirely and yet in any other discussion re eugenics etc it's a word used often. I also didn't hear you mention Marie Stopes in your list of names, a contemporary of those you listed. Your avoidance of both led me to think that had more to do with your day job on the Guardian, as to omit both the word abortion + MS were glaring omissions.\" Nonsense, said Freedland. If I were worried about a Guardian backlash, I wouldn't have written the piece in the Guardian. And there was a whole paragraph about Marie Stopes. Didn't you see it? \"I still haven't read all the column,\" admitted Dorries. \"But u tweeted that it was excellent piece, linked to it + called it 'an abortion article'. Thought you'd read it,\" said Freedland. Oh dear, checkmate. Off sloped the member for Fact-Check West. twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
