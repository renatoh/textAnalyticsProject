Officials at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) have written to Downing Street to say the idea was not cleared with them, and could carry risks. In a speech on Monday morning, in which he confirmed he was not standing to succeed Theresa May and urged some of the crowded field of contestants to drop out, Brokenshire outlined what he said were personal ideas for \u201ca new deal with the British people\u201d. Part of this was the idea of allowing people to use money in their pensions to fund a deposit on a first-time home purchase. \u201cWe should be changing the necessary regulations to allow this to happen, protecting the integrity of pension investments but allowing lenders to innovate and design new products to bring this opportunity to consumers,\u201d Brokenshire said. \u201cIt seems rather obtuse that we would deny people the opportunity to do this, given that we know those who own their own home by retirement are on average wealthier and do not have the burden of the largest expense in retirement \u2013 accommodation. And it is, after all, their money.\u201d The average person aged 35 to 44 has a total pension wealth of about \u00a335,000, Brokenshire said. \u201cIf a couple could combine their pension wealth, both potentially using a proportion to support a deposit, this would make a huge difference to millions of lives,\u201d he argued. \u201cIt would give people real choice, real opportunity.\u201d But a DWP source said the idea had not been discussed with the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, or her department, and that officials had outlined their worries to No 10. The source said: \u201cWe cannot support this policy because the evidence shows it will be risky and does not help the people it intends to help. The housing market doesn\u2019t need people to dip into their pensions to buy more houses.\u201d A spokesman for Brokenshire said the idea was \u201csimply about economic freedom\u201d. \u201cIt is about giving people greater choice over their own money, and no one is forced to take part \u2013 people can use their capital in the way they want to,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe Conservative party needs to reconnect people to capitalism, and this is one of many ideas we should be exploring as the leadership race takes place.\u201d There has been wider concern among some officials about rules allowing people to dip into their pension funds, potentially leaving them short of money in older age. Rules on dipping into pensions were loosened under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government when the then pensions minister, Steve Webb, said it was up to people to decide. \u201cSo actually, if people do get a Lamborghini, and end up on the state pension, the state is much less concerned about that, and that is their choice,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
