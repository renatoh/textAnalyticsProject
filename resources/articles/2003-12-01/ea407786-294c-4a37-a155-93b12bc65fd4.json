We never stood a chance, though at least community service at the Fiver Towers Correctional Facility has helped. Sort of. We'd like to say we're now a reformed, rejuvenated character, but we're not. And at the merest suggestion of a fight breaking out, as happened this lunchtime, the blazer comes straight off and we're clamouring for claret. As fights go, they don't come much bigger than first v second in the First Division: West Brom v Norwich, no-holds-barred and pinching permitted. It all started when Norwich caught the Baggies eyeing up their man, Darren Huckerby. He wasn't their man as such, but he'd whispered those three little words (\"Is that gross?\") during a 16-game loan love-in from Manchester City. Norwich announced this morning they'd made a bid for their man, but if it wasn't enough that the Baggies were already courting Wigan's Geoff Horsfield (who should have signed by the time you read this), the cads also made Man City an offer they couldn't refuse: \u00a3750,000. No wonder the Fiver made its way to the bike sheds drooling this lunchtime, praying for what's known in the trade as a right good dust-up. But... ahh! What's this?! Where are the gruff men in vests wielding brickbats? And why on earth is Richard Briers drinking tea with a sober-looking chap in a blazer? What? Eh? Oh, it seems the Fiver's misjudged the mood again. It's Norwich's Nigel Worthington: \"It was nice to be able to agree a fee. We've now got to be patient and see how it all pans out.\" And West Brom suit Jeremy Peace: \"We still have to agree personal terms with Darren and his agent and there are other clubs interested.\" Bah! On more than one level, this just won't do! * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Of course I have heard it. What do you want me to say? You know that in football everything is possible\" - Ruud van Nistelrooy fiddles with his mane, flutters his eyelashes and mutters into his nosebag about Real Madrid's interest. Some Manchester United suits may be feeling very sweaty this afternoon. * * * * * * * * * * * * GENITALGATE - FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! ETC Guilt can be an ugly thing to live with, as the Fiver found when his Short Sharp Shox palm buzzer short-circuited Granny Fiver's pacemaker many Christmases ago. But those were the days when a clip around the ear and two days' incarceration in the woodshed (aka Fiver Towers Correctional Facility) were revenge enough for even the grossest of misdemeanours. But there's no such luck for Real Madrid's Goldenballs OBE, whose crotch-grabbing, hand-shaking antics didn't cut any ice with Deportivo La Coruna's Lionel Scaloni. (There's a gag to be made about rubbing people up the wrong way, but even the Fiver wouldn't stoop that low.) Lionel has promised Becks the most hideous of vengeance when Real visit Deportivo in May. And not without good reason: \"He fouled me from behind, we both fell over and threw out a couple of kicks and after that he made a gesture that I didn't like at all,\" Lionel pouted. We await confirmation from Manuel Miguel Seve Castanets Javier Jesus Gibraltar Is Ours Ole! Ole! Ole! Fiver - to give him his full name - that there was a further cry of \"El Bundle!\" and a vigorous exchange of Chinese burns, but what the Fiver can tell you is that there are no bygones in the crazy world of Lionel Scaloni: \"I will be waiting for him in our Riazor stadium for the next game,\" he glowered. \"Our fans will have banners saying 'Wellcome to Hel', and everyone will throw offal at him\", he may or may not have continued. So what does our man with the gilt-edged sword make of it all? \"I sort of know what they're saying to me,\" Beckham bluffed, surreptitiously thumbing through his lexicon of Spanish terrace-talk. \"At one point I just tried to walk away. A few of their players were still saying things, but I haven't got a problem with it. As far as I was concerned it was over, but [Scaloni] wanted to continue.\" Too right he did: \"There is always a chance of revenge in football and we will see each other again on a football pitch,\" blustered Lionel, whose brother, apparently, is massive. * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Manchester United are being linked with Fulham's Louis Saha, with sums of \u00a37m being bandied about. Liverpool want Forest defender Michael Dawson and Montpellier striker Fode Mansare. Everton would like to sign Strasbourg midfielder Christian Basilla, please Santa, if you don't mind. And Rivaldo seems to have made his mind up on Sao Paulo. Like Boro, Spurs and Wolves really gave him much of a choice. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Leeds' attempts to quash those Chinese consortium rumours have taken a bashing, with news that China's 11th richest man, Xu Ming, who is chairman of Chinese First Division side Dalian Shide, is interested in rescuing them. The Bolton belt is tightening and big-boned Sam Allardyce may soon feel the pinch. With parent company Burnden Leisure nearly \u00a340m in debt, there's talk of a pay cut for Big Sam. Former England and Nottingham Forest star Gary Charles has admitted in court to abandoning one car he had crashed into a barrier on the A448, then being found drunk and asleep in another, which he had driven into a hedge. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV1: Football League Extra (2.30am) The sight of the Fiver down on its knees begging is nothing new, only usually we'd expect enough coppers for a Purple Tin or two.
