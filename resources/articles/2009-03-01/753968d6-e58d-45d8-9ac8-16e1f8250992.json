The 24-year-old will start Sunday's Australian grand prix knowing he will be at the wheel of a McLaren-Mercedes which is unlikely to carry him to a repeat of his 2008 victory in the opening race of the season. Hamilton and his team-mate, Heikki Kovalainen, were significantly off the pace in testing earlier this month. Testing, however, can be a notoriously inaccurate indicator of a formula one car's true racing potential and there is an inevitable tendency for any team displaying such a performance shortfall to play down the long-term implications of this. Consequently, when McLaren's team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, then admitted that he did not think the team's new MP4-24 contender would be competitive from the start of the season, his comments were greeted with surprise and disbelief \u2013 surprise that any team chief would make such a candid admission, disbelief that McLaren could have apparently got it so wrong when it came to interpreting the new technical and aerodynamic regulations introduced for this year's world championship. \"We go into the start of the 2009 season fully aware that we do not have the technical package that will allow our drivers to fight at the front,\" he said. \"We begin our season with the huge determination to reassert ourselves at the front and we will not rest for a moment until we have done that.\" McLaren, with its huge resources in terms of wind tunnels, specialists in computational fluid dynamics \u2013 an ultra-sophisticated system of reproducing aerodynamic performance away from a race track \u2013 were expected to be at the sharp end of the technology battle to get the most out of the new rules intended to produce closer racing and more overtaking. \"It's probably the biggest set of aerodynamic regulation changes in formula one's history,\" said Paddy Lowe, the McLaren director of engineering, at the start of the new car's development phase. \"Almost everything \u2013 the front and rear wings, the diffuser, floor and bodywork \u2013 is affected. I don't think there's ever been that level of change.\" Yet somehow the team's calculations seem to have gone badly wrong. On the strength of Hamilton's form at the wheel of the McLaren MP4-24 at the penultimate pre-season test at Barcelona just under a fortnight ago, it seemed as though the team faced the prospect of running in the midfield pack at best. Hamilton lapped the Circuit de Catalunya 1.9sec slower than Rubens Barrichello in the Brawn BGP 001, prompting Whitmarsh to say: \"The performance shortfall is clearly chassis-centric. Inevitably, in 21st-century formula one, it is a car's aerodynamic aspect that confers the greatest pluses and minuses to its overall performance package, and that would appear to be the case with the new MP4-24.\" The airflow over and under the entire length of the car is the key determining factor which dictates how a formula one car will handle and the exiting of the airflow through the ramp-like diffuser panels between the rear wheels on either side of the car are absolutely central to producing a good handling car. There is speculation that there could be a discrepancy during the complex procedure of correlating the information gained in the wind tunnel and transferring that data to the car which has somehow led McLaren to make an error in the MP4-24's technical layout. During the final pre-season test at Jerez the team was concentrating on analysing every aspect of the car's aerodynamic behaviour, even going so far as to use fluorescent paint on the front wings to show how the airflow is behaving. The airflow over the front wings inevitably dictates the flow under and over the rest of the bodywork and engineers will have been watching to see if there is any indication of \"flow separation\" whereby the airflow becomes detached from the front of the car, causing a major loss of downforce. McLaren are not new to such problems. In 1995, the team's first year using Mercedes engines, the cars proved astonishingly uncompetitive, prompting Nigel Mansell to leave the team after only two races. Yet by 1997 they were back at the sharp end of the grid winning races."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
