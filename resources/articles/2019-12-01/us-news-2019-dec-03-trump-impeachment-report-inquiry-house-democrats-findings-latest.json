Trump \u201cabused the power of his office for personal and political gain, at the expense of [US] national security\u201d, congressional Democrats concluded in the report released on Tuesday, which laid out incriminating conclusions after two weeks of public hearings. Saying evidence made plain that the president improperly pressured Ukraine to influence the 2020 election, the Trump-Ukraine Impeachment Inquiry Report used language that seemed to lay the groundwork for several potential articles of impeachment. The US House intelligence committee voted on Tuesday evening 13-9 along party lines to approve the report for referral to the judiciary committee, which would weigh articles of impeachment the full House could vote on by the end of the year. Republicans now have two days to submit \u201cminority views\u201d before the intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, transmits the report and its appendices to the House judiciary committee. The report also accuses Trump of a cover-up in which he \u201cordered and implemented a campaign to conceal his conduct from the public and frustrate and obstruct the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry\u201d. In a statement, Schiff and the leaders of two associated committees said: \u201cThe president\u2019s actions have damaged our national security, undermined the integrity of the next election and violated his oath of office. \u201cThey have also challenged the very core of our constitutional system of checks and balances, separation of powers, and rule of law.\u201d \u201cThe evidence is clear that President Trump used the power of his office to pressure Ukraine into announcing investigations into his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and a debunked conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 election. \u201cThese investigations were designed to benefit his 2020 presidential re-election campaign.\u201d The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, claimed Democrats had \u201cutterly failed to present evidence of wrongdoing\u201d. She said: \u201cChairman Schiff\u2019s report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger.\u201d That description was difficult to square with the report itself, which over some 300 pages described 100 hours of testimony from 17 witnesses and 30 hours of public hearings. The report is split into two main sections, one on \u201cthe president\u2019s misconduct\u201d and the other \u201cthe president\u2019s obstruction of the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry\u201d. \u201cThe evidence of the president\u2019s misconduct is overwhelming, and so, too, is the evidence of his obstruction of Congress,\u201d it said. \u201cIndeed, it would be hard to imagine a stronger or more complete case of obstruction than that demonstrated by the president since the inquiry began ... \u201cThe broad outlines as well as many of the details of the president\u2019s scheme have been presented by the witnesses with remarkable consistency. There will always be some variation in the testimony of multiple people witnessing the same events, but few of the differences here go to the heart of the matter.\u201d On Monday, House Republicans issued a 123-page defence of Trump, insisting there was \u201cno quid pro quo, bribery, extortion or abuse of power\u201d, a blueprint for House Republicans to defend Trump at a high-stakes judiciary committee hearing, scheduled for Wednesday, where constitutional law experts will lay out the grounds for impeachment. In London on Tuesday, Trump told reporters: \u201cThe Democrats have gone crazy and you know what? They have to be careful because when the shoe is on the other foot, and some day, hopefully in the very long distant future, you\u2019ll have a Democrat president, you\u2019ll have a Republican House and they\u2019ll do the same thing because somebody picked an orange out of a refrigerator and you don\u2019t like it so let\u2019s go and impeach them. That\u2019s not the way our country is supposed to be run.\u201d Trump also attacked Schiff in highly personal terms. \u201cI learn nothing from Adam Schiff,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he\u2019s a maniac. I think Adam Schiff is a deranged human being. I think he grew up with a complex for lots of reasons that are obvious. I think he\u2019s a very sick man. And he lies.\u201d But back in Washington, Trump\u2019s contention that Ukraine, rather than Russia, may have interfered in the 2016 election suffered another blow. David Hale, the No 3 official at the state department, told the Senate foreign relations committee he had seen no evidence of Ukrainian meddling. Asked if he agreed that Russian interference was a \u201choax\u201d, Hale replied: \u201cNo.\u201d Asked if he was aware of any evidence to support such a theory, he said: \u201cI am not.\u201d Trump would be only the fourth president to undergo the impeachment process and could become the first to be removed by the Senate. Such an outcome seems unlikely, however, as the Republican report underlined how the party has rallied to the president\u2019s defence. Congress heard evidence that Trump attempted to bribe the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, by making a White House meeting and nearly $400m in military aid conditional on an investigation into Biden and the theory Ukraine meddled in 2016. Monday\u2019s Republican report directly contradicted the testimony of diplomats. It made little attempt to get to grips with the devastating evidence of Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the European Union, who spoke about the existence of a quid pro quo, or Fiona Hill, former top Russia expert at the White House, who warned against falling for Moscow\u2019s propaganda. Instead it presented the affair as a Democratic plot. Republicans also claimed evidence does not prove that Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, and a \u201cshadow\u201d group of US officials conspired to benefit the president politically. \u201cAt the heart of the matter,\u201d it said, \u201cthe impeachment inquiry involves the actions of only two people: President Trump and President Zelenskiy. The summary of their 25 July 2019 telephone conversation shows no quid pro quo or indication of conditionality, threats, or pressure \u2013 much less evidence of bribery or extortion.\u201d Trump has persistently told Democrats and other critics to read the transcript of that call. They have pointed to 10 words \u2013 \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though\u201d \u2013 as clear proof he expected a quid pro quo. The military aid was later released."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
