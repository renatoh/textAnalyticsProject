The clubs are putting the finishing touches to a transfer for which Spurs will pay an initial fee of \u00a310m, rising to \u00a311.5m depending on achievements. As they completed the construction of their new stadium Spurs let the last two transfer windows pass without any major recruitment, so the purchase of Clarke is evidence of loosening purse strings at the north London club. However, Clarke will not strengthen Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s squad immediately, as he will be loaned straight back to Leeds to continue his development there next season. The player enjoyed a breakthrough campaign with Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s side last season, showing himself to be a bold and skilful dribbler with useful end-product. Most of his contributions came off the bench, as he only made four starts all season. His progress was inhibited partly by illness, as he was out of first-team action for a month after collapsing on the pitch during the 1-1 draw at Middlesbrough in February. Leeds expect him to play a bigger role next season and help the club to reach the Premier League automatically after they lost to Derby in the play-off semi-finals in May. Spurs trust the player will gain from another campaign in the Championship under the guidance of Pochettino\u2019s former mentor, Bielsa. Spurs are still pursuing players they expect to make a more instant impact as Pochettino aims to bolster a squad that reached last season\u2019s Champions League final. Fulham\u2019s Ryan Sessegnon is a target and talks continue with Lyon for the midfielder Tanguy Ndombele, with Spurs confident despite reports of Juventus trying to muscle in on a deal. Ndombele is understood to have indicated that Spurs are his preferred choice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
