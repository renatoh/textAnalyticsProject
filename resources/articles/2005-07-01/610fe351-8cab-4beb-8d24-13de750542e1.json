The helpline number is currently 0870 1566 344, a national rate number for which British Telecom charges 7.5p per minute in peak-time weekday hours (6am to 6pm), 3.75p off-peak on weekdays and 1.5p at weekends. It can cost much more from mobile telephones, costing up to 40p a minute with T-Mobile's pay-as-you-go tariff. Numbers beginning with 0870 are not included in unlimited call or inclusive minute deals offered by telecoms companies, which only apply to so-called \"geographic\" numbers starting with 01 or 02. Some organisations advertising 0870 numbers receive part of the charges made to callers. However, it is understood that this is not true in this case. Ms Blears told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the 0870 number was chosen because it allowed more calls to be taken simultaneously. It can handle 200 incoming calls rather than just the normal 40. Such non-geographic numbers redirect calls to geographic numbers and can balance demand by sending calls to a variety of locations. \"It was set up because it had extra capacity and there would be nothing worse than getting the engaged signal. At least with this system, everybody gets a reply,\" she said. \"But I am concerned about this [the cost of calls] and, therefore, we are going to review it urgently,\" she said. Cable &amp; Wireless, which is providing the 0870 casualty helpline number to the Police IT Organisation, which is running it, said it could also provide freephone 0800 numbers. But that would be more expensive to the customer organisation because it would have to meet the cost of all the calls. Matt Peacock, the director of communications for telecoms regulator Ofcom, described the use of an 0870 number for the emergency helpline as \"completely inappropriate\". He said this is partly due to the high cost, pointing out that 0870 calls from payphones can cost up to 20p a minute. He added that 0870 and 0845 numbers are often inaccessible from overseas, unless foreign telecoms companies have made specific arrangements. \"We've said that it's inappropriate for public sector bodies to use them,\" said Mr Peacock. \"What happened to London was an international tragedy, so to put up a helpline number that can't be accessed from overseas is entirely inappropriate.\" Last October, Ofcom said it would consult on the use of 0870 and 0845 numbers and publish the results in the next few weeks. Other public services are also discouraging the use of 0870 numbers. In February, the Department of Health banned NHS organisations in England, such as GP surgeries and dentists, from using premium-rate numbers, including 0870. At that time, 290 GP surgeries were using 0870 numbers. They were given a few months to change over to geographic numbers or an 0845 number, which costs less to call."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
