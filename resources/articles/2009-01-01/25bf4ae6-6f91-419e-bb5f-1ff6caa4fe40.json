With little over two weeks before the squad leaves for the West Indies, the Durham fast bowler said: \"They have got to get their heads together and have a chat and sort out the issues. It's about the England cricket team \u2013 not Peter Moores or Kevin Pietersen. \"It's not ideal because we are at the start of an Ashes summer but we don't want it to go on and on with what we've got coming over the next nine months. They will come and go like all other players, but they have got to be in harmony because otherwise they will drift the team further apart. If there is a problem it needs to be sorted sooner rather than later.\" Friends and colleagues rallied around Moores today, insisting the treatment of the England coach, whose job has come under intense pressure following rumours of a rift with Pietersen in the past week, is \"shabby\" and shameful. Mark Robinson, who replaced Moores as the Sussex coach in 2005, said: \"It's a great shame that instead of being sorted out in the dressing room it's in the public domain. Peter is a people person. It's his way to sort out problems face to face over a beer. He's not political or sly or manipulative in any way. \"Kevin, who's only been captain for a few months, should have shown Peter support instead of banging his fist on the table. Then the two of them should have worked out a way forward. A new team has been put in place on and off the field and they should be given the chance. \" Tony Pigott, the former Sussex chief executive who hired Moores before they won the County Championship for the first time in 2003, said: \"I roomed with Peter for 10 years and knew he was the right man . He did very well at Sussex and he did very well at the academy. And he would do very well with England if given the chance. If you let the England captain take charge you're asking for trouble.\" But Ray Illingworth, a former England captain and chairman of selectors, said: \"The captain should have the main say. If he doesn't then he doesn't have the backing of the players. Moores is more of a stats man with a clipboard and Pietersen is more of a flair man with his own instincts.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
