Last year, the company closed seven sites which it said had been acquired as part of a larger acquisition and did not fit the Po Na Na model. Just two of the sites identified have been sold, while a further two were added to the disposal list in December. In a statement to the stock exchange Po Na Na said: \"In view of the slow progress in achieving value from the disposal process and the amounts being indicated by interested parties, the carrying value of the disposal sites is currently under review.\" The seven unsold sites contributed an operating loss of \u00a3260,000 in the six months to October last year, and yesterday Po Na Na said they continued to \"hold back\" growth. Nigel Popham, a leisure analyst at Teather &amp; Greenwood, yesterday cut his estimate for Po Na Na's full-year pretax profit from \u00a34m to \u00a33.5m, adding that a write down on the unsold property could be about \u00a31m. Chief executive Christian Arden said he expected to have \"confirmed offers on all of them by the end of this month\" following a substantial write down. Commenting on recent trading, he said the company's core Fez and Po Na Na clubs had done well \"but overall performance was held back by a minority of sites\". \"Trading in the final quarter... has been less buoyant than in the preceding quarter, with sales marginally below the boards expectations.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
