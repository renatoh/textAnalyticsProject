Unlike in rugby's World Cup final, youth held sway. Echoes of the rugby washed round the ground in the rain and chariot dirge and, after Ipswich had done their bit to keep the pack tight at the top of the table, Royle said of Bart-Williams, on loan from Charlton, \"he's not the most obvious talent but he's our only midfielder who can do the patrolling job\". He was their Richard Hill, tidying up, closing down, breaking up midfield runners, prompting attacks, no fuss. It was a good day for Ipswich to win. On Friday they unveiled a public share issue. They looked a club worth sharing in. After six games they had two points and were bottom. Now they are contending with the best of a largely even lot, leading scorers though this was only their second clean sheet. After the enforced sale of key players Jim Magilton's experience takes on greater import and Ian Westlake, from the academy, suggests by his lively maturity on the left that the club are back on the right track; there are more like him on the way. But the club may need to hang on to their loan players. Another, the striker Shefki Kuqi, looks suited to a pub side, the King's Arms perhaps. With lofty air, waddling run and wafting limbs he could be the king himself. But his cushioned volley that played Westlake in for the second goal was sublime. Earlier he had won a penalty that set Neil Warnock going later on the referee Mick Fletcher: \"He obviously didn't want to give it. He was 10 yards away but he takes notice of a linesman flagging from 45 yards. I thought we should have had two penalties before that.\" Last week Warnock betrayed signs of reason in not wanting the Leeds job. Here he warmed to his theme: \"Managers are supposed to be able to talk to referees half an hour after a match but he said to put it in the report. We mark out of 100. That means he'll get an average of 50 if Joe gives him 100.\" Warnock is refreshingly honest, less so his players perhaps, seemingly bent on winning by penalties as England were supposed to. The difference was England did not whinge at what went against them. Football has much to learn from rugby.
