Eagle Eye is a movie in this vein, with a strong conspiracy-paranoia angle, but its sheer silliness and dumbness are a drag. Shia LaBeouf plays Jerry, a young slacker whose high-achieving twin brother, employed in the military, has been killed in a car accident. A misjudged counter-insurgency attack in Afghanistan (based, I am chagrined to note, on faulty intelligence from \"the Brits\", so the whole thing is basically our fault) has resulted in anti-US terrorist attacks. Innocent Jerry is framed by unseen forces as a terrorist and he is forced to go on the run from the authorities, along with a terrified single mom played by Michelle Monaghan - the pair manipulated by a faceless figure with apparently limitless power to control all technology. The deafening crashing of cars, whose impacts are so frequent and persistent as to be a virtual drum-roll, becomes tiresome and there is an awful plot glitch when the sinister manipulating force has to be defied with impunity so that both LaBeouf and Monaghan can survive for the film's big finish. Some nonsense is fun, but this wears you down."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
