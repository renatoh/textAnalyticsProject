Gray's challenge on Madjid Bougherra earned him a late booking before he received a second yellow card in injury time for kicking the ball away. Burnley manager Steve Cotterill had no complaints about the dismissal though he said Gray, a former Wednesday player, told him he had not heard the whistle blow before his action. \"He said to me 'I didn't hear the whistle' and I would have to say I would go along with him and believe him. Having said that, he's kicked the ball away and the rules state that the referee has to send him off, so we can have no complaints.\" Wednesday took the lead in the 66th minute with a Steve MacLean penalty , awarded for Jon Harley's foul on Frank Simek, before O'Connor struck with eight minutes remaining. Also unbeaten are Cardiff City, whose manager Dave Jones predicted \"exciting times ahead\" after the 1-0 home win over Coventry City. Michael Chopra's 79th-minute winner takes Cardiff into fourth place but they were made to work hard by Coventry, who coped well with the early loss through injury of both the right-back David McNamee and his replacement Adam Virgo. \"It was a just reward for our efforts and a very hard game,\" said Jones. \"This is a young side, and if they can turn on displays like this now then they will be even better in a few years. I feel there are exciting times ahead at this football club both on and off the field.\" Newly promoted Colchester continue to struggle. They were beaten 2-1 by Barnsley after taking the lead through Greg Halford. Marc Richards made up for a number of earlier misses by heading in the equaliser before Brian Howard won it with a long-range strike. Goals from Martin Rowlands and Nick Ward gave QPR their first win of the season, 2-0 against Southend In League One, Port Vale and Nottingham Forest maintained their perfect starts with Forest manager Colin Calderwood enjoying a winning return to Northampton Town, the club he left in the summer. Former Forest defender Chris Doig, who earlier conceded a penalty that Jack Lester missed, turned the ball into his own net shortly after half-time for the only goal. Port Vale took top spot on goal difference with a 1-0 win at Cheltenham. Leon Constantine scored his third goal of the season 10 minutes into the second half to condemn the home team to their first defeat. Two sides relegated in May, Walsall and Swindon Town, lead the way in League Two. Walsall won 2-0 at Hartlepool courtesy of two first-half goals from Dean Keates, but Swindon needed an own-goal right on half-time by Rochdale's Alan Goodall in a match in which both Christian Roberts and Paul Evans missed penalties for Dennis Wise's home team."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
