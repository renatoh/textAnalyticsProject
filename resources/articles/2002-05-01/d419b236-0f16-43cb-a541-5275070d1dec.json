I taught - or failed to teach - at three different schools in three terms in 1970-71, and then I quit. The first was a secondary school in Tower Hamlets. The second, also secondary, was in Ruislip. The third, an infant school, was in Hayes. The worst school was the second one. The pupils threw chalk at me in class and stones at me in the playground. One wrote in an essay \"She (meaning me) is a horrible teacher and can't control the class for peanuts.\" Thanks, dear. In the playground I saw some boys smoking and told them to give me their cigarettes. A boy said, \"They're in me pocket, Miss,\" and his friend added, \"Wouldn't you love to stick your fingers in his pocket, Miss?\" The maths teacher was a very kind person. He once reproached a class where I'd struggled and failed to keep in order, and referred to me as \"young Miss C-\" (as I then was). The next day a student invited me to admire his work of art. It was a badly executed drawing, but two things were clear: a woman's naked breasts, and a man's erect penis. Obviously the little boy had his own doubts about his gift as an artist, because he had labelled the drawing: Young Miss C- and Mr (Maths teacher). When I handed in my notice at my last local authority, I had an interview with three nasty people demanding to know why I was deliberately about to make myself a burden on the state. I replied that I was already looking for work - any work as long as it wasn't teaching. I did get a job as a clerk but my experiences caught up with me, and I spent four months in a psychiatric hospital. \"Pupil behaviour is an almost universal concern\", said a recent Public Voices headline in the Guardian. You never wrote a truer word."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
