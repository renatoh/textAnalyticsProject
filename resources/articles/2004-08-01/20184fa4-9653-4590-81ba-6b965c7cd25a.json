Prompted by interest from leading retailers including Ikea, B&amp;Q and Tesco, they are discussing strategies that could be launched soon after the next general election. 'Sooner or later someone will move for a more realistic approach,' said David Ramsden, the former deputy chairman of the Shopping Hours Reform Council, the lead organisation that pushed for Sunday shopping. 'Total deregulation is the only sensible option. The 1994 legislation was a compromise.' Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, said it was aware that retailers had been taking soundings to establish what level of support they would have for a move to make Sunday a normal trading day. Debenhams is the latest retailer to test shoppers' mood with a 'browse' hour that will start in October in all its stores that have cafes. Other retailers are under stood to be ready to test the law by arranging internet purchases for collection on Sunday before 10am."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
