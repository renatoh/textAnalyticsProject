But, after the first two days of competition, the British Olympic Association must be wondering if the \u00a31m it has spent was worth it. First, on Saturday Joanne Bromfield and Laura Donaldson filled the last two places in the moguls, then yesterday the snowboarder Lesley McKenna and the ski jumper Glynn Pedersen failed to make much impression. There had never been high hopes for Bromfield and Donaldson but McKenna was considered one of the team's main hopes for a medal, only for the 27-year-old from Aviemore to crash out in the first run of the half-pipe event and fail to qualify for the final of the second. She had gone into the competition ranked seventh in the world and, with two second places in World Cup events coming into the games, was a real contender. But her competition, in which the snowboarder rides down a 155-metre u-shaped pipe cut into the snow performing aerial manoeuvres three metres above the rim of the sheer walls, fell apart at the top of the first run. As her chosen music - Deee-lite's Grooves in the Heart - pumped out of the loudspeakers down the course she made three high jumps, gaining more height than any of the other competitors. But, being \"a little overexcited\", she landed badly after the third jump and it killed her speed. When she went for a 540-degree rotation on her fifth jump she was unable to get the height to complete it and crashed into the snow. McKenna had a second chance to make the final, a race-off between the top 12 riders from the first two runs, but gained less height. Her response to finishing 17th out of 23 was: \"I'm better than that. I know I could have made the final but I just didn't have the luck today.\" It was perhaps little surprise Pedersen failed to qualify for the 90-metre competition. The 20-year-old, who lives in Thunder Bay, Canada, admitted his real goal was gaining experience with an eye on the next Winter Olympics in Turin. Pedersen knew at the top of the 90m hill in the Olympic Park that he would have to jump well to qualify. In the end he mistimed his take-off and managed only 78.5m, giving him a total of 88 points when marks were added for style. Germany's Sven Hannawald achieved the longest jump at 99m, but that was only good enough for silver, with the gold going to Switzerland's Simon Ammann. At least, unlike the last Briton to jump in the Olympic Games - one Eddie \"the Eagle\" Edwards - Pedersen did not come spectacularly last. That honour went to Alexei Silaev of Russia, and left Pedersen in 55th place out of the 60 jumpers. \"I got my timing a little wrong on take-off,\" he said. \"I feel I would have qualified if I had got it right, but this has been a great experience for someone as young as me.\" His Olympics are not over, though, as he gets a chance to try to qualify again in the 120m competition tomorrow. Expectations of a sudden British revival should not be placed too heavily on the youngster who qualifies for Britain through a Scottish mother and English father. His longest jump on the K120 is 113.5m. The winners will be expecting to fly up to 130m and qualification is the best he can hope for. His coach Jeremy Baig is protecting him from one particular line of questioning. \"People always want to talk to him about Eddie the Eagle and that doesn't help matters,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
