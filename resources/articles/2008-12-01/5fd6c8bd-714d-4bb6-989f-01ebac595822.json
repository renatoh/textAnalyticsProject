Thordarson, the former Stoke, Barnsley and Notts County boss, will take over at Gresty Road at the end of the month, with caretaker boss Dario Gradi continuing to manage team affairs for the Boxing Day game Oldham and Sunday's trip to Hartlepool. Thordarson's first game in charge will be the FA Cup third-round tie at Millwall on January 3. The 53-year-old - who also had a three-year stint in charge of the Icelandic national team - had been with IA Akranes in his homeland after leaving his post at Meadow Lane in 2005, but was sacked from that job in July. He replaces Steve Holland who was sacked in November and is appointed with the Alex bottom of Coca-Cola League One and seven points from safety having won just three league games all season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
