In losing 5-1 at home to Middlesbrough \u2013 their worst result in a disappointing recent run in which they have collected maximum points only once in six matches \u2013 they dropped from fifth to ninth in the table. Boro's win, their first in five matches under their new manager Gordon Strachan, took them from 10th to sixth. Their destruction of QPR was started by Dave Kitson, who opened the scoring with his third goal in as many games since joining on loan from Stoke. Kitson was then upstaged by his striking partner Leroy Lita. He made it 2-0 from a penalty and after QPR pulled one back through Patrick Agyemang, Lita capitalised on a mistake by Mikele Leigertwood to get his second goal. A Lita shot that hit a post led to Gary O'Neil increasing Boro's lead. He had an opportunity to clinch a hat-trick when he and Mark Yeates broke clear, but Yeates ignored his pleas for a square pass in favour of getting Boro's fifth goal himself. Blackpool also lost their place in the top six in losing 2-1 at home to Barnsley after taking the lead 12 minutes from the end. Barnsley, who have been transformed since Mark Robins became their manager, equalised with a Bobby Hassell header from Iain Hume's corner and added their other goal from an Andy Gray penalty. It was Blackpool's first home defeat in the Championship. The only team who have yet to experience defeat at home are Newcastle, who maintained their unbeaten home record in beating Watford 2-0 despite having Kevin Nolan sent off. As at Blackpool, there was plenty of late excitement at Peterborough and Derby County. Peterborough, a goal ahead against Swansea, were hit by two in the last six minutes from the Swansea substitute Lee Trundle. However, they also scored during this period, their captain George Boyd following an excellent run down the left flank with a low cross for Aaron McLean to score a last-minute equaliser. Derby, too, found themselves 2-1 down against West Bromwich Albion, after being ahead. But having conceded a Simon Cox equaliser eight minutes from the end and a Graham Dorrans goal in the third minute of stoppage-time, they still managed to draw level through their substitute DJ Campbell. Not a bad way for Campbell to mark his Derby debut on loan from Leicester \u2013 especially as West Brom's second goal had stemmed from his mistake in being caught in possession One on-loan striker making a particular impact is Billy Sharp. His goal in Doncaster's 3-0 win at Crystal Palace \u2013 their first league away victory of the season \u2013 brought his total since they borrowed him from Sheffield United to seven in 14 games. Another player who stood out was Reading's Jobi McAnuff. He set up both goals in the 2-0 win at Sheffield Wednesday. It was Wednesday's fourth successive home defeat and put them only a point above the relegation zone. An Elland Road crowd of 36,723, the biggest League One gate of the season, saw Leeds held to a 2-2 draw by Huddersfield after twice being ahead. In an enthralling match, Huddersfield came agonisingly close to inflicting on Leeds their first home defeat in 21 matches with an Anthony Pilkington free-kick that hit the underside of the crossbar. Norwich's Grant Holt, with a far-post header from a Chris Martin cross, scored his 19th goal of the season in the 2-0 win over Oldham. Who would bet against him becoming the first Norwich player to reach the 20-goal mark before Christmas since Hugh Curran 40 years ago? Aldershot, who produced one of the biggest League Two surprises of the season with their 5-2 win at Dagenham and Redbridge last Tuesday, increased their unbeaten run to eight matches in overcoming Chesterfield 1-0. Aldershot, who rode their luck at times \u2013 notably when Jack Lester hit the post with a header \u2013 seized the initiative with a goal from their defender Anthony Charles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
