At Euro 2005 Powell introduced the teenagers Karen Carney and Eniola Aluko, both of whom have become established internationals and now play in America's Women's Professional Soccer league. Now the national coach, after giving debuts to the youngsters Dani Buet and Jess Clarke during last month's Cyprus Cup tournament, has called up the Doncaster Belles' midfielder Rachel Williams and the Arsenal striker Gemma Davison for the first of three friendlies in the build-up to Euro 2009. Buet and Clarke are also included and Powell said: \"These younger players have been brought in so we can assess them in a senior squad situation but, if a Carney or Aluko springs out, it would be fantastic.\" Carney, Aluko and England's three other US-based players \u2013 Kelly Smith, Anita Asante and Alex Scott \u2013 have also been named in the squad as Powell looks to keep them involved despite their club commitments. The departures of Smith, Scott and Carney from Arsenal have weakened the previously near-invincible Premier League champions, who are in danger of losing the title they have held for five years. Everton's 5\u20130 win against Bristol yesterday put them level on points with the Gunners with a game in hand at the top of the table. Chelsea will finish third after beating Leeds 3\u20131."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
