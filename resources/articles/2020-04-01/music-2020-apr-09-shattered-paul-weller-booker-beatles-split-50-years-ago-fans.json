Taking the form of a Q&amp;A, most of it explained what his debut album, McCartney, was about (\u201chome, family, love\u201d). Then came this: \u201cAre you planning a new album or single with the Beatles?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cDo you foresee a time when Lennon-McCartney becomes an active songwriting partnership again?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Paul McCartney never actually said in person that the Beatles had split, but these responses told journalists all they needed to know. \u201cPaul quits the Beatles,\u201d announced the front of the Daily Mirror the next day, as the story ricocheted around the world. Here, exactly 50 years on, we talk to Beatles fans and insiders about the day the band\u2019s era-defining story finally came to an end. Paul Weller: \u2018They were my entire universe\u2019 Then: 11, schoolboy, Maybury School, Woking. Now: 61, musician My mum had a part-time job in the local newsagents and I can remember seeing a headline: \u201cPaul \u2013 I Quit\u201d on that fateful day. I couldn\u2019t make sense of it. I was shattered. The Beatles were my entire universe. I now see it as inevitable and also necessary, because in hindsight they couldn\u2019t have gone on into the 70s. It wouldn\u2019t have felt right. Bowie took their place, I think. But I also wonder what would have happened if they had continued. Would there have been 50 years of OK or shit records to lessen their meaning and impact? Would they still remain as important as they are now and will always be? The Beatles will always be my guides. They were my four prophets from the north. They came to show us there\u2019s another way to live \u2013 and to rejoice in what we have. Paul Weller\u2019s 15th solo album, On Sunset, is released 12 June on Polydor. Annie Nightingale: \u2018They weren\u2019t pop stars any more\u2019 Then: 30, journalist and Radio 1 DJ. Now: 80, Radio 1 DJ I witnessed the unravelling close at hand. I was a friend of the band\u2019s label Apple, one of the few allowed into the hallowed halls. I\u2019d been a journalist and a TV presenter, so I\u2019d known the band well. They\u2019d also helped me get my first Radio 1 job that February. But it felt that everyone was papering over the cracks. Apple had been this utopian dream. The band wanted to share the fruits of their successes by looking after other groups, but they\u2019d been so vulnerable and lost since [their manager] Brian Epstein died. They weren\u2019t really pop stars any more by 1970, either. They were artists. But they were still extensions of who they\u2019d been at the beginning \u2013 young people who told you you absolutely didn\u2019t have to be like your parents, for the first time. I remember it being a really sad day, and being really worried that the hard-won ground they\u2019d built would be lost. We really didn\u2019t want the establishment coming back. Annie Nightingale\u2019s memoir, Hi Hey Hello, is published on 3 September by Hachette. Bonnie Greer: \u2018I moved to the UK because of them\u2019 Then: 21, history undergraduate. Now: 71, writer, broadcaster, Trustee Emerita of the British Museum, OBE I was just 21 when Paul McCartney announced that he was releasing a solo album, and oh, by the way, the Beatles were breaking up. They had been a part of my life ever since they came on the Ed Sullivan Show, six years earlier. I can still see the curtain parting after that rather stiff old guy announced them, and there they were. I listened on my transistor to a black radio show, Herb Kent the Cool Gent, which was usually just Motown and soul. One day, the opening chords of Paperback Writer came on, and everything changed for me. I had been a black girl growing up on the south side of Chicago, in the civil rights movement, the black students movement, Bobby Kennedy, all of it, but then there were the Beatles. They gave me agency. I moved to the UK because of them. Weird that it took four boys from Liverpool to do that. Through all their permutations, the Beatles were like Oz or Alice in Wonderland, a passageway to another world. When they broke up, I knew that we were entering another era. And we did. Freda Kelly: \u2018The fans didn\u2019t want it to end\u2019 Then: 25, Beatles official fan club secretary. Now: 75, part-time legal secretary There was still a lot going on in the fan club in early 1970. I had my daughter by then. My husband did shift work, so I\u2019d drop her off at a creche, get to the office and answer lots of letters. Fans would ask if they were splitting all the time. I\u2019d try to avoid answering. The breakup had been on the cards for a while. I wasn\u2019t surprised. People grow up \u2013 other priorities came along, like wives and kids. I kept the fan club going for another two years, sending old records and press handout photos. I closed it down when I was pregnant again in 1972, then took time off to bring up my kids. I went back to college and became a secretary at a solicitors. The fans didn\u2019t want it to go. But I never looked back. Alan Johnson: \u2018They healed America after JFK\u2019s assassination\u2019 Then: 19, postman. Now: 69, former home secretary, author of In My Life: A Music Memoir I was a father of three, living on a council estate in Slough. Listening to Abbey Road the previous summer, it was obvious it was coming. That side two medley, finishing with The End \u2013 it\u2019s all there. I still can\u2019t listen to that without tears in my eyes. It\u2019s hard to impress just how much of an effect they had on wider society. They healed America after JFK\u2019s assassination. Kids in Russia thought of different lives after hearing their music. They set off a huge wave of creativity that was bearing so much fruit by 1970: I was enjoying Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and one of Apple\u2019s own, Badfinger. They had tempered each other as a band, Paul tempering John\u2019s cynicism, John tempering Paul\u2019s tendency to whimsy. By 1970, as a fan, you knew they wanted to be themselves, and the Plastic Ono Band\u2019s album in 1969 had made that clear. Still, you thought they might get back together. Until Lennon died, we still thought they might. Mike Vickers: \u2018They\u2019d done everything by that point\u2019 Then: 30, orchestral arranger, Moog operator on Abbey Road. Now: 80, author of A Week in the Life: Working With the Beatles on All You Need Is Love I genuinely wasn\u2019t aware of things getting dodgy. The previous summer, they\u2019d been doing the vocals for Because when I walked into the studio, and it sounded sensational. You couldn\u2019t imagine this was a band about to break up. I\u2019d also done the arrangements for the TV performance of All You Need Is Love in 1967, and knew about Paul from my friend Peter Asher [brother of Jane, McCartney\u2019s then girlfriend]. Peter said Paul was one of those people who knew exactly what had to happen next when making music. He was right. He was beyond brilliant in the studio, and a great leader, although I can imagine how that might have caused stress. Given they\u2019d done everything else at that point, I bet they decided breaking up was the next thing to do. Think about what most artists do in a lifetime. They did it and more on their albums in seven years. Booker T Jones: \u2018I spent all my quarters playing them on the jukebox\u2019 Then: 26, leader of Booker T and the MGs. Now: 76, author of My Life, Note by Note We released McLemore Avenue, our tribute to Abbey Road, the same month the Beatles split. Abbey Road had made me want to do more than R&amp;B and work with people like Leon Russell, Quincy Jones and Bill Withers. You could hear that the Beatles were desperately trying to be four individuals by then. I\u2019d loved them since I\u2019d first heard them as a college freshman, pouring all my quarters into the jukebox to play I Want to Hold Your Hand. They\u2019d also been so generous to us on the 1968 Stax tour of the UK. They even sent us a limo! When it was over, it was sad, but it was time. We were fortunate they made the sacrifice to be together with each other for so long. Richard Williams: \u2018It didn\u2019t matter \u2013 there was tons to listen to\u2019 Then: 23, Melody Maker assistant editor. Now: 73, music and sports journalist Sounds magazine had just started up and we\u2019d lost lots of staff, so I\u2019d suddenly become number two at the Melody Maker. I\u2019d also become their Beatles person. John and I had always got on quite well, but he was on the brink of moving to LA. We all knew they were breaking up. To anyone in the business, the Mirror story didn\u2019t really seem like news, just confirmation. It didn\u2019t matter that the Beatles weren\u2019t around much by then. The Stones weren\u2019t either. It was a very dynamic time musically. There was still tons to listen to: heavier stuff like Led Zeppelin, country-rock like the Flying Burrito Brothers, great singer-songwriters, the early stirrings of glam. The last word on the Beatles didn\u2019t come until John sent us a letter in November 1971, which properly put the limping dog out of its misery [in response to an interview Paul had done in the paper that month, discussing the Beatles\u2019 financial woes]. Them using our postbag to communicate with each other was thrilling, but it felt pretty final. No one thought there\u2019d be a reunion tour. Then again, rock\u2019n\u2019roll wasn\u2019t old enough then to have reunion tours. Lillian Adams: \u2018We\u2019d go to John\u2019s house on the bus\u2019 Then: 21, Beatles fan since 1961. Now: 71, retired finance editor I was amazed when I heard they\u2019d broken up. You\u2019d read how they didn\u2019t like Yoko, they didn\u2019t like Linda, how Paul wanted the Beatles to be looked after by his girlfriend\u2019s dad and brother, which surely didn\u2019t sound like a good idea to anybody other than him. But I thought they\u2019d get through it. They\u2019d been the Beatles since they were kids. How could they be anything else? I\u2019d seen them lots in my early teens, living not far from Liverpool. On Saturdays and school holidays, my friends and I would go to John\u2019s house on the bus as we had nothing else to do. We only saw him once. You got such little access to pop culture back then. You\u2019d get your Beatles monthly magazine, Top of the Pops once a week on the TV \u2013 but that was it. The idea of seeing your favourite group any minute of any day was unbelievable. I discovered so much music from the Beatles. I wouldn\u2019t have liked the blues without them \u2013 I was more into John Mayall, Eric Clapton and Cream by 1970. But I still bought every Beatles album and I loved Abbey Road. I couldn\u2019t believe they wouldn\u2019t be there any more. Don Letts: \u2018It wasn\u2019t a bad thing \u2013 the first solo records were great\u2019 Then: 14, schoolboy, Tennison\u2019s School, London. Now: 64, film director and BBC Radio 6 Music DJ My older brother Desmond worked in Carnaby Street and he\u2019d bring Beatles records home. By the late 60s I had all the Beatles bootlegs with the three pigs on the label, and was a young Apple scruff, hanging around outside. I eventually had the second biggest collection of Beatles memorabilia in the UK, before punk came and saved me. To me, the Beatles laid the blueprint of all the possibilities in pop. If you followed the emotional arc of their records, you could tell things were going wrong. I remember thinking it wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Those first solo records were great: John\u2019s raw emotions laid out with the Plastic Ono Band; George\u2019s godly piece of work, All Things Must Pass; Paul consistently making great stuff. I also got more into Trojan reggae and American soul after they split; the duality of my existence as a black British person meant that, as one side of that equation was faltering, I\u2019d go into the other. But even now, the Beatles\u2019 music has an impact on people\u2019s lives. It will live on for ever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
