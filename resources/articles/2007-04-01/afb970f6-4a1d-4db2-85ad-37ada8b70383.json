Probably the only way to do it is to kill him. When he runs at you, you try to grab his shirt or do whatever you can. But he just goes past you, makes fun out of you and leaves you kicking the air\" - Patrice Evra. Thankfully for Patrice, Keith Gillespie is only on the bench tonight. Unfortunately for Phil Jagielka and co, Cristiano Ronaldo plays for United, which is more or less enough to guarantee the three points will be theirs. That should take the team which has scored 19 more goals than any other in the Premiership this season - Chelsea are second incidentally, above the Emirates Entertainers - six points clear of the champions having played one game more. I do think United will drop the four points needed to open up the title race for the Blues, but I can't see this game contributing to that tally. Teams Man Utd (4-4-2) Kuszczak; Fletcher, Brown, Heinze, Evra; Ronaldo, Carrick, Scholes, Giggs; Rooney, Smith Subs Van der Sar, Solskjaer, O'Shea, Richardson, Cathcart Sheff Utd (10-0-0) Kenny; Geary, Morgan, Kozluk, Kilgallon, Jagielka, Webber, Montgomery, Tonge, Kazim-Richards, Shelton Subs Alan Quinn, Gillespie, Armstrong, Fathi, Nade Referee R Styles (Hampshire) Van der Sar is either dropped after his recent poor form or rested after his nose-knock against Watford. I guess we'll know when Fergie names the United team to play Middlesbrough on Saturday. Otherwise it's the strongest available XI, with Darren Fletcher asked to do a job at right-back. The Blades team is cut and dried, ie I have no idea how they'll line up and neither does Andy Gray. Lest it be forgotten, though, this is a hugely important game for them too - they're only two points above the drop zone before tonight's game in hand. 7.52pm \"At least Sheffield United can rest safe in the knowledge that the awards for most comical defence and most crushing defeat of the day have already been won,\" says Archi Campbell. 1 min And we're off. Sheffield United start as they mean to continue - with 11 men in their own half. Shelton then plays what will probably be their most progressive pass of the game - the kick-off. The ball soon works its way back to Paddy Kenny though. 3 mins The Blades are playing five at the back, with Kazim-Richards on the right and Webber on the left the men most likely to support lone striker Shelton. The big man (Shelton) wins a free-kick 25 yards out after shrugging off a challenge from Fletcher and then being fouled by Scholes. Now then... 4 mins Michael's Tonge goes straight down Kuszczak's throat. GOAL! Man Utd 1 - 0 Sheff Utd (Carrick 4) Ronaldo is, of course, the creator. Receiving the ball from Scholes he took his marker out of the game with a deft turn, then slid the ball forward to Carrick. It was a surprise to see the midfielder so far forward, but not a surprise, given the goalscoring form he's in, to see him delicately chip the ball over the onrushing Kenny. 6 mins Smith finds Rooney on the edge of the box. He turns inside Kozluk, but fails to slot his left-foot shot past Kenny. Then Giggs lays the rebound off to Scholes at the edge of the box, but he drills his shot high and wide. This could make last week's Roma match look like a nailbiter. 8 mins \"When do you suppose was the last time a Prem-leading team started an important (Sheff U, yes, but still 3 points) with only one first-choice player from their back five on the field?\" asks David Studer. \"And don't say May 1911, when Chesterfield Horsehair played against Wolseley Motor Works with only Nobby Boils in net and four kids in front of him. Every serious fan knows this to be an urban legend, and that one of those kids was in fact the legendary Tommy Malepattern, whom many mistook for a fellow much younger than his veteran 52 years.\" Chelsea earlier this season, David, when Terry, Cole, Ferreira and Cech were all injured. 10 mins United are playing in the same formation as the Roma thrashing, with Giggs playing off Smith, and Rooney playing as a left forward. Ronaldo is simply everywhere, which makes Derek Geary's task of man-marking him even more difficult. He must have been chuffed when Neil Warnock assigned him that job for the evening. 12 mins Tonge, considered by the red-tops to be such a hot prospect a few years ago when he scored a goal against Liverpool, has a crack from the edge of the box. It's easy for Kuszcszcssak though. 14 mins \"I want to know how Giggs, Scholes and Gerrard made the PFA shortlist, and Rooney made the Young Player of the Year list?\" says T. Charles Rutanhira angrily. \"I can think of 22 other players who have played better than them this season.\" Only 22, T.? \"What happened to the likes of Michael Essien, Dimitar Berbatov, Mikel Arteta, Matthew Taylor, Gabriel Agbonlahor, Benni McCarthy? Can anybody say big-club favouritism?\" I bet Scholes, Giggs and Gerrard can. Rooney might not have played as wellI as he can, but he certainly deserves to be on the young player list - he's scored 19 goals this season! I agree Essien should certainly be on the shortlist, and I also think Lampard has had a better season (for club not country) than Gerrard or Fabregas (who has scored all of one goal). For what it's worth - about the same as Derek Geary after tonight's game probably - here's my team of the year: Foster (Cech close but missed too much of the season) Finnan Carvalho Vidic Evra Ronaldo Scholes Essien Giggs Drogba Berbatov 17 mins Ronaldo fires a free-kick in his own image - high, wide and handsome. 19 mins This Shelton chap looks a bit of a handful. He's big, strong and very powerful, and Brown is struggling to contain him. Meanwhile, Evra, already limping, is on the receiving end of a very ugly challenge by Geary. The ref shows him the yellow card - it could have been red. 20 mins Ferguson is forced into making a change: Evra off, Richardson on. United now have none of their first-choice back five on the pitch. 22 mins \"Whilst I'm badly placed to take the mickey out of names, it seems a shame Julian Dicks is no longer playing in a position to have Michael Tonge all over him,\" chuckles Kevin Titman. Kevin, come on now. 24 mins \"It's Kuszczak, which has the same four-letter consonant sound as that city in Western Poland called Szczecin,\" says Damien Neva. \"Is this any help?\" Nope. Thankfully for this Grauniad minute-by-over reporter, the United keeper hasn't had too much to do so far, except boot a few backpasses up the pitch. 26 mins Lovely link-up play between Giggs and Carrick, but Morgan reads the latter's throughball quicker than Smith. It's noticeable that Carrick has been getting forward more and more in recent matches, maybe in a bid to prove to Fergie he could dovetail effectively with Hargreaves in the United midfield next season. 28 mins Booking shocker #1: Smith is booked for a late, unnecessary tackle on Kazim-Richards. Booking shocker #2: Rooney is booked for moaning about booking shocker #1. 30 mins \"The strangest coincidence!\" says David Studer, referring to Evra's injury. \"The exact same thing happened to Nobby Boils, back in 1911. Horsehair had to bring on Stan 'Filthy Hanky' Fairfoul, the club's trainer's mate/boiler tech. He played a blinder, too. Can't say that about your precious Stamfords.\" And while David was busy entertaining us, Giggs and Ronaldo took it in turns to perform a little shuffle before curling crosses at Sheffield United legs. 33 mins It's fair to say that the early goal hasn't done much for the excitement levels of this game. Rooney does his best to quell any lingering hope of Sheff Utd getting a result (other than a tonking) by heading Ronaldo's cross towards Kenny's goal. Or, to be more accurate, towards Kenny. 36 mins Shelton rattles Kuscsczcsczcsczcsak's net .... the Blades fans celebrate .... but the ball had gone the wrong side of the post. A decent hit froma tight angle, but it would have taken an absolute screamer or an absolute howler to beat Kuzsczcsczsccsak from there. \"Who is this joker?\" asks Rob Smyth. Assuming he's not referring to me, Shefff Utd bought Luton Shelton for \u00a31.85m from Helsingborg in the January transfer window. This is his first start since then. 39 mins Sky have done me up like a kipper. \"Rooney's off!\" I shout to my colleagues after watching him cynically trip Tonge. But then the ref fails to follow the yellow card with a red because he wasn't actually cautioned for dissent earlier in the game, as I was led to believe. 41 mins Kozluk nearly takes Rooney's head off, though it wasn't intentional - he was swinging his right foot at the ball when Rooney nipped in in front of him. It might not be a bad idea for Ferguson to whip Rooney off as soon as possible - otherwise there's a fair chance of him being either sent or carried off. 43 mins For all United's possession, Paddy Kenny hasn't had many saves to make in the Sheff Utd goal. Warnock's tactic of having Ronaldo and Giggs man-marked is proving effective, though it doesn't solve the issue of how they're actually going to score a goal themselves. Which, in the grand scheme of things, is quite important. Half time As Sean Ingle said to me before the match, it's got an easy 3-0 written all over this. The Blades have put in a performance that's usually patronised as \"courageous\", but in fact it's nothing of the sort. If they want to keep the score down then their tactics are spot on; if they want to actually take something from this match they need to open up and try to take the game to United's makeshift back four. Then we'll see if they're courageous. Emails \"United are currently playing with two midfielders at wing back and two wing-backs at centre-back,\" says James Hamilton, stretching the point slightly by claiming Brown and Heinze to be wing-backs. \"And, despite being behind, Warnock is still playing a 9-0-1 formation, refusing to test the patched up back line. \"They are handing the match to us on a plate.\" \"How bad is this Cathcart fella if Fergie is willing to play Richardson as a defender (/at all) ahead of him?\" says Damian Barrett. A question that doesn't need an answer, Damian. \"Hardly morale boosting.\" \"What's the greatest percentage of a club's matches to be televised live in any one season?\" asks Gary Naylor. Tragically, I know that the answer to this question is Liverpool in 2000-01. I'm going to pretend I don't know the actual percentage. \"There must have been some Man Utd games not covered live this season, but not many.\" \"Arsenal have a young goalkeeper with an almost eerie name too, Wojciech Szczesny. It's an invasion of weird Polish goalkeeper names!\" exclaims Samuel Zakowszczckszksckszczki. 46 mins Anorak alert: if United win tonight, it will be the first time they've won 10 home league games in a row since the Busby era. They've got 45 minutes to hang on in the face of incessant Sheff Utd pressure/defending. 48 mins After his heroics against Arsenal in nets, Jagielka proves he's better at saving shots than, er, shooting shots by firing harmlessly over Kuszcsczcsak's goal from 30 yards. GOAL! Man Utd 2 - 0 Sheff Utd (Rooney 50) Giggs's reinvention as an inside forward has been one of the success stories of the season. Not only did he have the vision to pick out Rooney's run from left to right, he also had the feel in his left foot to measure a clipped pass perfectly into his path. Rooney took one touch to control and then volleyed past Kenny. Kozluk, who allowed Rooney to run free, should have done better - as, perhaps, should Kenny - but it was brilliant football from the United duo. 53 mins A great chance for Shelton! Brown, who has been sloppy tonight, allows the big Jamaican to turn him too easily, but Shelton then skewed his left-foot shot high and wide. In the context of this match, that was an open goal for Sheff Utd. 55 mins And now Webber shoots wide. This time it was Richardson who lost his man - quel surprise! - but Webber lost his nerve when the opportunity to score against his old club arose. 58 mins After that rare flurry of goalmouth action, United reassert their authority with a Rooney piledriver that Kenny fists away. \"Does Mr Naylor actually exist or is he simply a device you employ to set-up those moments of pure comedy?\" asks Brad Lundgren, Dolph's bigger, harder brother. \"The man (if he actually does exist) never misses a match.\" I'd love to take the credit for Gary Naylor's witticisms, but I'm afraid there really is a Ga ... actually, no, he doesn't exist. 60 mins Ronaldo skips past Geary but Kenny clutches his low cross at the second attempt. Geary has done well against Ronaldo, but there is very much a feeling the Portuguese wizard is saving his magic for future matches. 63 mins Smith, on the other hand, is desperate to boost his goal tally of two in 63 games. Receiving Scholes's pass, he turns and shoots from the edge of the box - but straight at Kenny. 65 mins Kenny, who moments earlier I had declared \"the worst keeper in the Premiership\" to Rob Smyth, makes a stunning save low to his left from Ronaldo, who moments earlier I wrote was \"saving his magic for future matches\". Top punditry. Maybe I could get a job for the BBC? 66 mins Ronaldo again swats Geary aside like an irritant fly, but again Kenny saves. Then the ref books Morgan and Ronaldo after they try to swap shirts at a free-kick 24 minutes before full time. 68 mins United may have Kuszsczcsczcak in goal, but Sheff Utd have their own version of the most famous Polish keeper ever - Jan Tomaszewski, who denied England a place at the 1974 World Cup. Kenny, who Brian Clough would have certainly labelled a clown on tonight's showing, has been all arms and legs tonight, making a string of clumsy yet effective saves. This time he stop Giggs's sidefooted effort with his right boot when most would surely have just picked it up. 70 mins More superb play from Shelton. Picking the ball up on halfway he took the most direct route to goal available, knocking the ball past Heinze and chasing after it. After sprinting past Heinze, he cut inside Richardson, but paused a nanosecond too long over his shot, enabling the Argentinian to make a recovery tackle. Having not seen a replay, the jury is open as to whether it was a brilliant challenge or an illegal one - if the latter, it should have been a penalty and a red card. 73 mins Rather strangely, a muffled chant of \"Jose Mourinho\" echoes around Old Trafford. I can't explain that one. Nor can I explain, having seen the replay, why the ref failed to award Sheff Utd a penalty for Heinze's tackle on Shelton - he played the man not the ball. \"He looks a serious player,\" says Smyth, and he's not talking about Heinze. 75 mins Sheff Utd sub: Kazim-Richards off, Gillespie on. The Blades should get the ball to the Northern Irishman as often as possible so he can run at Richardson. 77 mins And another change: Kozluk off, Chris Armstrong (no, not that one) on. 80 mins Ferguson isn't happy - he's clearly of the opinion that United should be more than just two goals up and expresses his disgust with a ticking-off for Ronaldo. The winger responds by breezing past Geary and skimming a shot along the turf which Kenny grasps. 82 mins United (super)sub: Giggs off, Solskjaer on. \"Greatest league in the world this,\" says Gary Naylor cuttingly, forgetting the Cricket World Cup Super Eight. 84 mins Rob Styles has been awful tonight. Not only did he miss the penalty and sending off, he has just booked Chris Armstrong for handballing - even though he was only two yards away when Solskjaer rapped his knuckles with the ball. He also showed his fussyness earlier when Ronaldo and Morgan were booked when most refs would just tell them to cut it out. 86 mins \"I am enjoying listening to the Blades on the internet as I do living in California,\" says Mark Grundy. \"Sounds like they are playing well - do you think they are good enough to stay up?\" We'll have a better idea after their next game - the trip to Charlton. If they avoid defeat, they will survive. Even if they lose, they should pick up enough points at home to Watford and Wigan to avoid relegation. 88 mins Tonge hits the bar! Carrick and Scholes stand off him so he launches a shot from 25 yards that dips and curls over and past Kusczcsczcsczcak, but bounces back off the metalwork. 89 mins Sheff Utd sub: Shelton, whose performance tonight suggests he could make the difference over the remaining four games, off, Nade on. Full time This was a match that both managers could have done without. Warnock's selection and tactics prove he didn't think the Blades could pick up anything from the game, while United were keen just to emerge from the fixture with three points and no more injuries - something they couldn't accomplish. Both sides will be more fired up for forthcoming fixtures, as will I. Thanks for your emails, Mike."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
