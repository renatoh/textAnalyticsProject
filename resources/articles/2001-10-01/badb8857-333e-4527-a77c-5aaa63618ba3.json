Halifax and Abbey National say they are firmly opposed to a service launched by Citibank which aims to pull together information about all the different accounts an individual runs online - from bank, savings and sharedealing accounts to email services and rewards programmes - and present it on a single web page. The service, called My Accounts, went live last week, is free and is open to non-Citibank customers. For details see www.citibank.co.uk. It's the first service of its kind to launch in the UK but has proved controversial because when setting up their personal page, individuals have to enter their PIN numbers and passwords for all the accounts they wish to include. Critics say this poses a security risk. But Citibank says that safeguarding people's confidential information is its utmost priority, and adds that it uses state-of-the-art security systems. Halifax and Abbey National said they were unhappy about being named on the site as institutions that apparently support My Accounts. They have both told Citibank they don't endorse the service and don't want to take part. And they warn that customers who go ahead and sign up will be in breach of the terms and conditions of their account. Citibank says the reference to Halifax was being removed from its website, which means My Accounts users won't be able to include Halifax accounts on their page. If and when it receives instructions from Abbey National, it will remove them too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
