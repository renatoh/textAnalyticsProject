I had this crazy notion that everything was going to be fine,\u201d she says. She squeezed in one four-hour antenatal class before her daughter Ruby arrived in a birthing pool. When she met other pregnant women after Herb, her second child, was born at home, she was struck by their anxiety: \u201cI just saw all this fear and I had this overwhelming desire to say, \u2018It\u2019s going to be OK.\u2019\u201d \u201cI had a really good birth,\u201d she says. \u201cI was lucky. Of course, it was really hard but it was manageable. I\u2019m not saying everything was a complete breeze \u2013 there was mastitis and expressing milk in train toilets on my way to jobs, it\u2019s all a nightmare juggle. But all I ever heard about was epidurals and caesarians and pain and fear \u2013 there was no positive information.\u201d One book she did come across was a collection of case studies gathered by the American home-birth pioneer, Ina May Gaskin. She found them soothing and began to wonder if she could do a visual series about childbirth \u201cshowing that people are OK the day after\u201d. She made postcards and leaflets and, as she went around her east London neighbourhood with her son in the buggy, put them up in newsagents and community centres. When women responded, she noted their names and due dates and asked them to let her know when contractions began. \u201cIt was me, my bicycle and my camera,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was no stylist, no makeup artist, no brief from a magazine. I didn\u2019t have loads of equipment, so I wasn\u2019t hiding behind the technical aspect. Sometimes a grandma would open the door, but I was usually there before any other visitors so the women were totally in their bubble with the baby. What a privilege to be invited into that and to document it \u2013 the generosity of people blew me away.\u201d This month, a selection of Lewis\u2019s portraits of new mothers are published in a book, One Day Young. Shot in natural light, often by a window with deep shadows and glimpses of furniture or washing-up liquid in the background, the pictures are muted and sombre. They are deeply tender images, but not all the women are beaming or filled with obvious joy. Lewis says that when she saw the first few, she knew she didn\u2019t want to stop. In the end, she photographed 150 women over five years and then agonised over choosing 40 for the book. \u201cI tried doing different angles and really pulling back, but always the strength seemed to be in the direct eye contact. It\u2019s the rawness I absolutely love and I didn\u2019t want to distract too much with different compositions. It\u2019s all about the mother and it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the back of the baby\u2019s head.\u201d To start with, she photographed women up to several days after delivery but increasingly stuck to a rule that the pictures must be taken within 24 hours of birth and at home. \u201cWhen I look back it was all about capturing their identity. Every single picture was so quiet and peaceful and you don\u2019t get that in hospital where everyone is diluted with everyone else\u2019s stuff. When you get home, a bubble forms and I felt I was coming in from the outside world trying not to shatter this atmosphere.\u201d Lewis worked hard to find women of different ages and backgrounds, seeking help from midwives to find teenagers, one of whom she photographed in a children\u2019s home. But her rule meant that many mothers (including those who, like me, spent days in hospital) were left out. I went to meet her wondering if I might find this annoying and the whole thing too jolly. What about the alarm many women feel when confronted with a new baby? What about stitches and depression? I came away convinced she has done something generous and brave. Lewis tells the story of a doctor she met who was furious with a woman who was told a labour horror story as she prepared to give birth. Lewis thinks women sometimes revel in the gory details of their own experiences and should think before they speak. \u201cI don\u2019t mean it\u2019s all fluffy and everything will be over in an hour. But childbirth is OK for some people and it might be OK for you. And even if it\u2019s really hard, you\u2019re still going to be OK with the proper support. It\u2019s not that the scared people shouldn\u2019t have a voice, but they shouldn\u2019t be the only voice. My project is one side of the story, but that story isn\u2019t talked about very much.\u201d Lewis studied painting at college, realised the dark room was where she wanted to be, got her first job working long hours at a big London studio and began assisting other photographers before starting out on her own. Today, she is regularly employed by magazines but wanted an outlet for her own ideas about what is beautiful \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s not about their eyebrows being perfect or their stomach being flat\u201d. She studied art history at school and noticed how male-dominated the subject was. \u201cAnything to do with women and motherhood is seen as a soft subject and not for the hierarchy of painting,\u201d she says. \u201cBut look at these women! Look in their eyes and see what they\u2019ve done. It\u2019s fascinating but people gloss over it and it drives me crazy. The idea of a female photographer doing a project on motherhood does almost make you want to jump off a cliff but it was a compulsion and the more pictures I did, the more I believed it was necessary.\u201d Did witnessing so many of these precious moments make her wish for more babies or feel sad about the stage of life she had so recently left behind? \u201cI didn\u2019t come away broody, I came away proud of the women,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what\u2019s around the corner, especially the first-time mums. The whirlwind hasn\u2019t even hit them. I used to come away fascinated. What\u2019s next for them? How are they going to cope?\u201d \u2022 One Day Young by Jenny Lewis is published by Hoxton Mini Press, \u00a312.95, hoxtonminipress.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
