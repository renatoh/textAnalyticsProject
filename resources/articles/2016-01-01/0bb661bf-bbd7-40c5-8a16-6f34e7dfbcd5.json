Having set up Georginio Wijnaldum for Newcastle\u2019s opening goal in the first half, the Serbia striker won and scored a penalty to make it 2-2 and then had a hand in Paul Dummett\u2019s late equaliser which denied Louis van Gaal\u2019s side victory. It was a timely intervention for a player who spent the first months of his Newcastle career struggling to settle. Sent off against Arsenal at the end of August in only his fourth match, the 21-year-old scored against Tottenham on 13 December and has been an important part of Newcastle\u2019s improvedform over the past few weeks. \u201cScoring will do a lot for my confidence. I needed that goal, you can see that in my celebration. I was really happy. It is good for my confidence and I hope I will keep scoring,\u201d Mitrovic said. \u201cI am getting better each game. It\u2019s difficult each game. Defenders are getting stronger. Maybe a few games and more time to adapt. Every game is different. It is different football to what I played in Belgium. It is a difficult time and maybe that is behind me. Every game I feel better and I have more confidence.\u201d Having completed the signing of Jonjo Shelvey from Swansea for \u00a312m on Tuesday, Newcastle are also in the market for a new striker, with Papiss Ciss\u00e9 set to be sidelined for a month after groin surgery. They have been linked with moves for Alexandre Lacazette of Lyon and Toulouse\u2019s Wissam Ben Yedder but Mitrovic insisted he is not unduly concerned by the speculation. \u201cI don\u2019t read newspapers. I am here to play,\u201d he said. \u201cI played good in the last few games. I have been unlucky. The goals will come.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s game was the second time since Mitrovic\u2019s arrival in England that he has come up against Wayne Rooney. After the final whistle, he sought out the England captain to swap shirts and believes Rooney can continue to play at the highest level for another 10 years, dismissing criticism of him as \u201ccrazy\u201d. \u201cI took the shirt from Rooney after \u2013 it is really amazing. He is a legend,\u201d Mitrovic said. \u201cI hope maybe one day I can be like Wayne Rooney. Some young players will be proud to play against me. It is amazing. You can see on the pitch how easy he moves and how easy he plays. He is a good player.\u201d Asked whether Rooney is finished, Mitrovic added: \u201cThey are crazy. They are people who don\u2019t watch football. If he doesn\u2019t score in a few games the team don\u2019t play well, he cannot play well. You can see on the pitch the way he plays during the whole game, how easy he plays. I think he can play 10 years more.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
