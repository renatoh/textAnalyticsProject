The first, launched in the early 1970s, aimed to outlaw pornography and presented him as a prurient reactionary and a shameless hypocrite touring the sex clubs that he wanted to close down. The second, which continued for the last three decades of his life, attempted to win parole for the moors murderess, Myra Hindley. Here Longford was at his most liberal, Christian and naive, building on a lifetime of interest in prison reform, to argue that Hindley, and indeed all offenders, could be rehabilitated if society was prepared to forgive. Of the two, it was his lonely battle to help Hindley that revealed the true man. The pornography escapade was an aberration, embarked upon against the advice of old friends and under the influence of Mary Whitehouse and anti-libertarians. From the day his report came out, Longford rarely returned to the subject. It was in the area of penal reform that he made his most lasting contribution. A Labour politician, who spent a record 22 years on the Lords frontbench, held junior office under Clement Attlee in the 1940s and later sat in Harold Wilson's cabinets, Longford could, when he resigned in 1968, have rested on his laurels. But he was not a conventional politician, and retirement gave him the freedom to take up the unpopular cause that was closest to his heart without fear of damaging his party. It was not only his appearance - noble cranium and mad scientist's tonsure - that set Longford apart from his government colleagues. Though a committed Labour party member, and a regular attender of PLP meetings and annual conferences well into his 90s, he saw politics less as a career and more as part of a moral crusade. Conscience came before party loyalty, heart before the head. Such a stance belonged more to the 19th-century philanthropic tradition than to 20th-century Westminster. And, in many senses, Long- ford was a 19th-century figure, struggling, often with humour, to deal with the problem of being born too late. Like William Wilberforce and Lord Shaftesbury, his was a privileged upbringing; like them, he was a devout Christian determined to translate faith into action; like them, he was an unpredictable combination of political savvy and childlike clear-sightedness. The essential difference between the three was that while Wilberforce reformed the slave trade and Shaftesbury the factories, Longford only aspired to alter the penal system. His failure could not be put down only to the changed climate of the 20th century. His own character played a part; never one to manage a concerted campaign, to push and cajole friends to a cause that many cabinet colleagues regarded indulgently as \"Frank's hobby\", he was too much the individualist, too fond of argument for argument's sake - an effect of his 1930s time as an Oxford politics don - and, ultimately, too lightweight in Whitehall to carry the day. With his knack for making people laugh, and his tireless enjoyment of socialising as well as socialism, it was too easy to ignore the fact that Longford was way ahead of his time in questioning the direction of prison policy. Though his prophecy of the failure of the punishment-oriented system of mainly Conservative postwar governments was repeatedly borne out, he never managed to translate his vision into workable reform. That is not to say he was without substantial achievements; it was just that the goals he set himself remained outside his grasp. He dreamed of being a reforming home secretary, an ambition that prompted his old friend Evelyn Waugh to remark \"and then we would all be murdered in our beds\". A prison visitor since the 1930s, Longford was still going, two and three times a week, to visit the abandoned and despised in jail until close to the end of his life. Though the tabloids port- rayed him as a man who got a kick out of contact with infamous killers - a throwback to the \"Lord Porn\" caricature - such \"names\" made up only one per cent of those Longford journeyed to see. An example; in the late 1980s, he was contacted by the solicitor for a young Dutchman, convicted of a drugs offence, sent to Albany prison on the Isle of Wight, suffering from Aids and cut off by his family. Longford was the only person to visit this dying man, a gesture repeated in countless episodes that never made headlines but which brought succour and relief. He also initiated practical measures to ease offenders' reintegration into society. He founded the New Bridge in 1955, the first organisation dedicated to ex-prisoners' welfare. In 1970, he established, in New Horizon, the first drop-in centre for homeless teenagers. Until the end, he spent time at New Horizon's offices, oblivious to its users' sometimes rough teasing, anxious to understand what had alienated them from the mainstream. He also contributed a series of learned reports on penal reform during Labour's period out of office between Attlee and Wilson. He chaired the committee which, in 1963, recommended the setting-up of the parole system, still the bedrock of the current system. Attlee admired Longford's passion for society's outcasts and tried, often against his colleagues' advice, to harness it. In the 1945 Labour land slide, Longford - then Frank Pakenham - stood for Oxford, but was defeated by Quintin Hogg, later Lord Hailsham. Attlee was persuaded to elevate him to the peerage, and bring to Labour's sparsely populated Lords benches a youthful thinker who had been Sir William Beveridge's right-hand man on his landmark welfare state report. Longford was tempted to decline the offer and await a suitable byelection, but feared that, since his childless elder brother was in poor health, it was inevitable that he would soon become the Earl of Longford. But accept- ance effectively relegated him to the role of also-ran in Labour politics. Without a Commons seat, he remained an enigma to his colleagues, outside the mainstream and, for some, a figure not to be trusted. Initially, however, he won rapid promotion. In 1947, Attlee made him, as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, responsible for the British zone of occupied Germany. It was Longford's finest hour as a minister. For a year, he worked tirelessly to stop the Germans starving to death. He reopened schools and hospitals, and worked with American and French counterparts on the currency reform that would bring stability to West Germany. He fought the Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, for a reappraisal of the industrial dismantling of the occupied zone under the reparations' policy, but Bevin refused. On the ground, Longford saw sooner than his superior that cooperation with the Soviets was impossible, and that partition was inevitable. Konrad Adenauer, the father of West Germany, came to regard him as his people's one true friend in London. This tribute was prompted perhaps by Longford's optimistic avowal to the Germans that the British had forgiven them the wartime excesses. His remarks caused a storm of outrage in a country still suffering rationing. Attlee was persuaded to move him to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, where he proved a successful minister, save for the mishandling of the report from a crash enquiry that almost cost him his job. Attlee stuck by him, and later raised him to First Lord of the Admiralty, just outside the cabinet. In opposition after 1951, Hugh Gaitskell, who had shared rooms with Longford at Oxford and referred to him as his \"oldest friend\", kept him at the centre of Labour affairs, even when he became chairman of a City clearing bank. The appointment caused some raised eyebrows in the square mile, where Longford was blackballed from at least one financiers' club. After Gaitskell's death in 1963, however, Harold Wilson had no time for such an unpredictable figure. Though included in the 1964 cabinet as leader of the Lords, Longford knew he was only there as a sop to the Gaitskellites. Wilson treated him with personal kindness but professional contempt, remarking that Longford - who had got a double first at Oxford - had a mental age of 12. By his own admission he was \"ineffective\" in the treacherous atmosphere of Wilson's cabinets. Even as Colonial Secretary in 1966, he was so dispirited that he failed to master his brief and was quickly removed. He had talked with Gait- skell in the early 1960s of taking up Tony Benn's Disclaimer Act and renouncing his peerages - both the inherited title which finally came his way in 1961, and the barony awarded by Attlee. Then he would be free to seek a Commons seat at the 1964 general election and, if successful, a cabinet post as head of a major department. Gaitskell had given qualified support; Wilson, however, pooh-poohed the idea. It was a deeply frustrating period. In terms of prestige, Longford had reached the pinnacle of his career but, in practice, he was impotent, and often resorted to playing up to his image as the cabinet jester. Wilson talked often of sacking Longford, so when he resigned from government in January 1968 over the abandonment of a commitment to raising the school-leaving age, it was a matter of jumping before being pushed. If Benn, Richard Crossman and Barbara Castle all recorded their relief at his departure in their diaries, the Queen continued to hold him in high esteem. In 1972, she made him a knight of the garter After 1968, Longford devoted himself to his campaigns and to publishing. He had already produced several volumes of autobiography and one book - Peace By Ordeal, on the background to the 1921 Anglo-Irish treaty - that was regarded as a classic. But his later efforts, while tackling ambitious subjects like humility and forgiveness, were politely, though unenthusiastically, received. From the floor of the House of Lords, as well as continually pushing the government on prisons' policy, he spoke of ten on Ireland, a country he regarded as his home. It was a claim - dubious since he spent the vast majority of his life on this side of the Irish Sea - that occasionally got him into trouble. While still in Wilson's cabinet, he attended the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Easter Rising, and was photographed next to his old friend President de Valera. Though he remained sentimentally attached to Ireland, Longford broke every tradition of his Anglo-Irish ascendancy family. He was born into a military, Protestant, Conservative and Unionist clan, and educated at Eton and New College, Oxford. As an adult, he embraced the Roman Catholic church and Irish nationalism. His failure to follow his soldier father, who was killed at Gallipoli when Longford was nine, remained an open wound . In 1940, he was invalided out of the forces after a nervous breakdown. He regarded the episode as the ultimate humiliation, but came to believe that it gave him some insight into the degradation of those sent to prison and shunned by society. In Elizabeth Harman, whom he married in 1931, Longford found the emotional warmth and love denied him as a child by a difficult, and often cruel, mother. Made painfully aware of his insignificance in her eyes next to his elder brother, he only recovered a sense of self-esteem while at Oxford. At a summer ball, he was asleep on a couch when spotted by Elizabeth, one of the most beautiful and sought- after undergraduates of her generation. \"The face was monumental beauty,\" she later wrote, \"as if some Graeco-Roman statue... had been dressed in modern clothes\". Two years later, when they were both lecturing for the Workers Educational Association in Stoke, at the height of the 1930s depression, love blossomed. It was Elizabeth, a great-niece of Joseph Chamberlain, who convinced Longford to join the Labour party. In return, having been converted to Catholicism while at Oxford by the Jesuit Father Martin D'Arcy, he persuaded her to join him in the church of Rome. He found great strength in the moral certainties of Catholicism. The Longfords enjoyed an extraordinarily happy marriage, touched by tragedy with the death, in 1969, of their daughter Catherine in a car crash. They remained active in their various political, literary and campaigning activities well into their 90s, relaxing only to enjoy their countless grandchildren and great-grandchildren at their cherished Sussex home, Bernhurst. Longford gave the family seat, Tullynally Castle in Co Westmeath, to his son and heir in 1961 upon inheriting it. With friends and family, his razor-sharp wit could flourish, while in public he felt he had to restrain it in the interests of being a better Christian. All the best stories about his eccentricity - and there were many - were first told, and no doubt embellished, by Longford himself. Myra Hindley became part of his extended family, the large group of writers, politicians and activists who satisfied his continuing need to be in touch with what was going on in the world. Such consultations would usually take place over lunch at the House of Lords. His conviction that Hindley would one day be his guest there went unfulfilled. She was, in many ways, an unworthy recipient of his concern. He ransomed his good name for her, but, once convinced he was no longer the key to her release, she moved on to other advisers. He knew what was happening, but saw it as natural and inevitable, and continued to strive for her freedom. Longford's memory will live on, if not for the scale of his achievements then certainly because of his courage, tenacity and nobility in trying. He was a man of great intelligence and moral strength. He is survived by his wife, four sons and three daughters. \u0095 Francis 'Frank' Aungier Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford, politician and social reformer, born December 5 1905; died August 3 2001 This obituary appeared in later editions of Saturday's Guardian"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
