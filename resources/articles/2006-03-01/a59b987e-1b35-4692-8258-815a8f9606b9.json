Speaking to a friend just now on the phone, they asked: \"why do you hate him so much?\" I replied, instantly, without thinking consciously but very forcefully, \"well, he isn't even Labour\". I've been thinking about it ever since. Is he? What is there about him that reflects the Labour party I joined as an admittedly brash but nonetheless idealistic working class lad back in Chorley 20 years ago. Has he spoken out about equality? Redistribution of power and wealth? The value of public spending, indeed state action to help the most vulnerable? Now, I know the government has done things based on all these values. But mainly through Gordon Brown. But has Blair been a powerhouse for any of these things? Has he made the case for them - using his position to win hearts and minds? It occurred to me the other day that the reason why people don't recognise the improvements that all that extra Brown spending has brought about is that it has largely been done by stealth. There hasn't been a powerful ongoing narrative about the new deal, Sure Start and a multitude of other initiatives - why they've been done, why they've worked. Maybe that was brilliant electoralism, with Brown able to deliver while Blair reassured the middle-class. Or maybe, as I increasingly think, it was an enormous wasted opportunity to explain what the government - a Labour government - is supposed to be about: that we believe in the state helping the poor and disadvantaged, because it will help all of us, and because it is good in itself. There I go, sounding all Labour. It just doesn't sound like Blair does it? So, let's try and answer the question - is Blair Labour or not? If not what the hell is he?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
