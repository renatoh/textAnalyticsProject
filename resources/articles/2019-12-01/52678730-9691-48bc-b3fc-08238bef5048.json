His hectic start continues at Wolves on Sunday and, when he considers what his counterpart Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo has built at Molineux, there is admiration and even a hint of envy. Mourinho discussed the January transfer window and said he needs the players in his squad and, as such, did not think \u201cthere\u2019ll be many doors open for players to get out on loan\u201d. He knows funds will be limited for mid-season additions but what he most wanted was time to work with his existing squad. At least he will have his first clear midweek next week. After Wolves, Spurs do not play again until the following Sunday when they face Chelsea at home. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly clear [for January],\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI want to work. I\u2019m going to have time to work, which until now I don\u2019t have. I complain every day with my staff, the frustration of: \u2018I want to do a certain kind of training.\u2019 I just can\u2019t do it. I love pre-season to work. I don\u2019t have [that]. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a little bit of time in January and then depending on the week in February where we are not going to play the Premier League, we are going to have another week. I want time. We\u2019re going to play against a team on Sunday that has the same coach for three years; they develop ideas in a stable way. They play almost with a blindfold.\u201d Mourinho had Nuno as his back-up goalkeeper at Porto when they won the Europa League in 2003 and Champions League in 2004. Nuno was an unused substitute in both finals and barely played for Mourinho, although there is the famous story of him coming off the bench to score a penalty in the 7-0 win over Varzim. \u201cHe\u2019s a much better manager than player,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he was a bad player. He\u2019s doing really amazing work. He has one of the best teams from a tactical point of view \u2013 they play exactly the way he wants. His players are perfect for the puzzle.\u201d Mourinho said he picked his lineup for Wolves before Wednesday\u2019s Champions League visit to Bayern Munich, a dead rubber that finished in a 3-1 defeat. He was happy with Juan Foyth\u2019s performance, for example, but said: \u201cIs he going to start on Sunday? No.\u201d Regarding Giovani Lo Celso, Mourinho added: \u201cIt is obvious the way Dele [Alli] is playing and Son [Heung-min]. They are one step ahead. So you want to be objective and ask if he [Lo Celso] starts on Sunday \u2013 no, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Mourinho also mentioned Christian Eriksen, who has resolved to run down his contract, which expires next summer. \u201cHe was so honest with me and I was so honest with him. I am not going to betray that trust. I just share these intimate conversations with the structure of the club.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
