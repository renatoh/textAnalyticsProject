The new collection features 18 artists including H\u00e9lo\u00efse Letissier (Christine and the Queens), Kate Tempest, Ibeyi, Tracey Thorn, Nadine Shah, and Alison Moyet, as well as producer Catherine Marks, Radio 1 DJ Clara Amfo, and more. Here, Raphael reflects on the myriad changes over the past 25 years in society, the music industry, #MeToo, technology and social media, observing: \u201cThe mid-90s now seem not like a different country, but a different universe.\u201d While there were other artists Raphael would have liked to include in the new collection (it shares a title with Solange Knowles\u2019s 2016 album), time with A-listers tends to be limited and therefore limiting. As it is, there\u2019s a diverse mix of well-known artists and emerging talents. As with Bollocks, all subjects had copy approval so they could talk without fear of being misrepresented. The result is a series of wide-ranging, deep-dive, soul-baring interviews, full of candid, intimate, spiky meditations on inspiration, artistry, sexuality, race, love, self-doubt, abuse, defiance, and everything in between. There\u2019s Letissier on being empowered by drag culture: \u201cI gave a name to my anger.\u201d Shah on sexism: \u201cI met more than one arse-slapping pervert along the way.\u201d Tempest on discovering hip-hop and spoken word: \u201cI\u2019d found it. The thing. My thing.\u201d Moyet on ageism: \u201cPop music is the only arena in which it is assumed that your creativity decreases as you age.\u201d Amfo on being fist-bumped when everyone else gets a handshake: \u201cDon\u2019t dehumanise me \u2026 because I happen to be a black person.\u201d Rereading Never Mind the Bollocks together with A Seat at the Table, it\u2019s clear that Raphael had carved a vital space for female artists to \u201cwoman-spread\u201d, as it were, and speak freely. Women in music taking up space, making some noise \u2013 the female voice turned up louder. Even if you have only the sketchiest notions about bluegrass (people who resemble extras from Deliverance playing banjos fast?), there\u2019s much of interest in Wayfaring Stranger. Writer and classically trained violinist Emma John spent a year in the Appalachian mountains exploring this country roots form, which developed in the 40s: \u201cThe sound of an America of long ago: of railroads and prison gangs, of church revival and illegal liquor \u2026 An antique hybrid blending of Celtic and country sounds with blues, jazz, gospel\u201d. While John does not flinch from prominent disturbing issues (racism, guns, Trumpism, the neo-Nazi parades in Charlottesville), her aim was to immerse herself, not stand apart. \u201cI felt like an anthropologist stumbling across an uncontacted civilisation,\u201d writes John, as she reveals a vibrant secret world, replete with history, creativity, and sub-genres (fast jams, slow jams, progressive grass, hardgrass, spacegrass), as well as passions, rivalries and charismatic characters \u2013 not least the \u201cfather of bluegrass\u201d, Bill Monroe, who died in 1996. In communities so isolated that her arrival makes headlines in newspapers, John takes her \u201cfiddle\u201d (actually a centuries-old violin) to participate in \u201ccircles\u201d of ever-welcoming \u201cpicking\u201d friends anywhere she can (festivals, barns, dive bars, basements), pushing herself not just to equal the skill and pace of bluegrass, but embrace its spirit. In this way, Wayfaring Stranger goes beyond being an entertaining informative book about a niche musical genre: it becomes the story of John\u2019s personal mission to shake off a kind of existential stiffness \u2013 an inhibiting perfectionism \u2013 to rediscover not just her passion for music, but also for life. She concludes that, though she arrived on the bluegrass scene a \u201cstranger\u201d, she wasn\u2019t allowed to stay one for long. Books like this work best when they manage to pull in even the most casual reader, saturating them in the colours, emotions and sensations of hidden subcultures, and John more than delivers. If someone doesn\u2019t make a film out of this, they\u2019ll have missed a \u201cpicking\u201d trick. \u2022 A Seat at the Table: Interviews With Women on the Frontline of Music by Amy Raphael is published by Little, Brown (\u00a314.99).
