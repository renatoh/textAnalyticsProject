Cheerier highlights include bears playing in the snow. PH World on Fire 9pm, BBC One Life in Paris changes after the Nazi invasion, while Nancy (Helen Hunt) is taking risks in Berlin.

Ali Catterall The Disappearance of Susan Cox Powell 9pm, Sky Crime First in a four-part documentary series probing the unsolved case of a Utah woman who vanished in 2009, as well as the subsequent deaths of her husband and their two children. With participation from Powell\u2019s family and some particularly grim themes, this is not for the faint of heart. Hannah J Davies It\u2019s Grime, Up North 10pm, Channel 4 What else would you call a grime event in Blackpool but The Seaside Shutdown? Grime crew LOE have the branding spot on \u2013 does the music match the hype? As this series concludes, it\u2019s clear that this scene is thriving. But can break-out star Little T handle a live audience after years of video appearances? PH Film choice Rush 1am, Channel 4 Ron Howard\u2019s Formula One drama recalls one of the great sporting rivalries, between Britain\u2019s swashbuckling James Hunt and Austria\u2019s Niki Lauda.
