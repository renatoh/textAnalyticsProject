But as the BBC announces that most over-75s will have to start paying the \u00a3154.50 television licence fee, the legacy of the former chancellor\u2019s spending cuts is still being felt. The seeds of the licence fee decision lie in a secret deal struck in the immediate aftermath of the 2015 general election, when the Conservatives returned with an unexpected parliamentary majority. With the Liberal Democrats no longer in coalition, an uninhibited Tory government moved fast to impose new spending controls \u2013 hashing out a new settlement with the BBC director general, Tony Hall, in clandestine talks that lasted just a week. Under the agreement, the BBC would receive some funding boosts in return for taking the potentially financially ruinous responsibility for providing services to the over-75s. Osborne\u2019s politically deft move was to shift not only the cost of the licence fees for the elderly on to the BBC but also, after a short while, the responsibility for deciding whether the benefit should exist at all. It was a win-win-win for the Conservatives: the BBC would be financially weakened, the Treasury would have more money, and the public would blame the BBC when the axe finally fell. The axe fell this week. This time it was Hall \u2013 who back in 2015 had warned there would \u201cbe hard choices\u201d as a result of the deal he helped to strike \u2013 who made the announcement that most over-75s would have to start paying for BBC services unless they claim pension credit. One BBC insider noted that after receiving hundreds of thousands of responses to a public consultation, the British public were split 52% in favour of change and 48% in favour of maintaining the status quo \u2013 the same result as the 2016 EU referendum. \u201cThe government can\u2019t say that\u2019s not a mandate,\u201d they noted. Age UK points out that many poor over-75s who are eligible to claim pension credit do not do so, because they are put off by the paperwork or refrain from applying on a point of pride. BBC sources optimistically suggest that the decision to bundle in a free TV licence will drive uptake of the wider benefit. Extraordinarily, the Conservatives\u2019 2015 broken manifesto pledge to keep the licence fee free for over-75s was copied and pasted word for word into the party\u2019s 2017 general election manifesto. The party later said this was a mistake, apparently made in a hurry because the manifesto\u2019s authors were rushing to produce a policy platform on a tight deadline due to Theresa May\u2019s decision to call a snap vote. Although the BBC insists that the announcement had been planned before the Tory leadership election, unveiling the decision on the same day that candidates formally declared inevitably turned the licence fee into a live political issue. A Downing Street spokesperson said May was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with the BBC\u2019s decision and urged the broadcaster to reconsider, with government sources highlighting the high pay of many BBC executives as a potential alternative saving. To complicate matters further, Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP \u2013 no friend of the BBC \u2013 has strongly supported the continuation of the free licence fee, making the issue a potential negotiating chip in negotiations between the party and the Tories under the next Conservative leader. Osborne is now a journalist, having to make cuts to staff at the Evening Standard that he edits. But his political legacy leaves a conundrum for Conservative leadership candidates: do they stay quiet and hope the issue of BBC funding goes away, weakening an institution that some view as a leftwing ideological enemy? Or do they make a campaign pledge to restore the BBC\u2019s funding, in a move that will benefit many older voters \u2013 who overwhelmingly vote Conservative and might just have a party membership card, which allows them to choose the next prime minister?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
