Each of the last few winters has seen honeybee losses of up to 30%, and Garden Organic calculates that bumblebee numbers are about half what they were in the 50s. We need them to pollinate our crops, and they need us gardeners to help rescue them from the brink. There are some known causes for the decline that are beyond the average gardener's control: a parasitic mite is now endemic in UK hives, sapping the insects' energy and making them more susceptible to other pests and diseases; and the past two cold, wet summers have seen bees reluctant to leave their hives to seek food. But above all bees need homes to live in and food to eat. They have been badly hit by large-scale farming and the loss of wildflower habitats. This is where gardeners can step into the breach. Gardens account for an area larger than all of our nature reserves combined. If we can resist the urge to cover them in paving, we can provide habitats and flowers galore. And if we can make them pesticide- and herbicide-free, too, all the better. Flowers for nectar Do you pride yourself on having flowers all year round? Good. Your style of gardening suits bees down to the ground \u2013 they exist on pollen and nectar. Aim for a never-ending smorgasbord of flowers: aubrieta and bluebells; borage and hawthorn in spring; honeysuckle and lavender in summer; Michaelmas daisies and deadnettle in autumn. Leave grass to grow long, so allowing clover to flower. Highly bred bedding plants produce little pollen. Plump for traditional cottage garden plants and wildflowers instead. Create habitats It is possible to make nests for bees (see opposite), but the best will be those they make for themselves. Make this easier for them. A messy garden is a bee-friendly garden, so keep paving and decking to a minimum and leave some areas untidy and overgrown. Mulching with bark chips or black plastic has put paid to many potential nesting sites, so keep it to a minimum. Bumblebees also like compost heaps and hedges. Avoid chemicals There has been speculation that the pesticide imidacloprid (sold as Bayer Ultimate Bug Killer) can affect bees' memory functions, which could lead to them failing to return to their hives. It has been the subject of partial bans in France and Germany. Other commonly used garden formulations may also be implicated. Is it worth the risk? Find cultural ways to manage pest and disease problems. Make a home Bumblebees like a dark, airy hole in the ground with an entrance tunnel. Dig a shallow hole (about 15cm deep), place a cradle of chicken wire into it (for drainage) and top with soft nesting material. Place a paving slab over the top, and make several obvious side entrance holes, so the queens notice them. Solitary bees, such as mason bees, make their homes in small holes \u2013 tie bamboo canes together to provide holes for lots of them, and place the bundle in a dry, sheltered spot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
