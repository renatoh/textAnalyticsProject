But you don't have to dig too dip to enjoy horse-drawn sleighs, forests of pine topped with icicles and those slow-burning log fires. With just a little imagination and research, ski resorts can be the perfect setting for low-cost romance. And, of course, if you can afford it, there are plenty of exclusive spots, too. St Anton am Arlberg, Austria Discreet, cosy romance that won't cost the earth for full-on five-star luxury - this resort has it all. And the skiing, which caters for all levels, is superb. The mountain restaurants get a high star rating, and for the foolhardy there is a great floodlit toboggan run which begins at the Rodelalm, but you'll need to book. Just out of town but linked to one of the main ski areas by a new eight-man gondola, Nasserein has a cosy village feel with cheaper accommodation and a good choice of small family-run restaurants. The little-known Rasthaus Ferwall, a small wooden chalet deep in the forest, can be reached by taxi or sleigh. The Arlberg Hospiz in nearby St Christoph was first built in 1300 as a shelter for travellers crossing the mountains from Venice to Austria. Now it is a five-star hotel renowned for its food and wine, with a 600-year-old wine cellar and one of the most extravagant collections of Bordeaux in the world. Where to book: Simply Ski (020-8541 2209, simply-travel.com) offers a week's full board in February in the chalet hotel in Nasserein from \u00a3755pp including flights. Elegant Resorts (01244 897333, elegantresorts.co.uk) has seven nights' full board at the Arlberg Hospiz from \u00a31,570pp. Further information: stantonamarlberg.com. Jackson Hole, Wyoming, US A perfect combination of a Wild West town with the best of American accommodation and service. Aman Resorts liked it so much they built the Amangani, which means \"peaceful home\" in the language of the Shoshone tribe. If you don't want secluded luxury, there's rowdy drinking and country and western at the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar, a couple of cheap and cheerful Italian restaurants and gastro-dining to rival any Ramsay or Conran enterprise - try the Snake River Grill for starters. The skiing is deep and steep - but don't be put off. Beginners and intermediates have gentler slopes, too. Where to book: Amangani (001 307 734 7333, amanresorts.com) costs $675 per night for a suite; Elegant Resorts offers seven nights from \u00a32,450pp. Ski Independence (0870 5550555, ski-independence.co.uk) has seven nights' B&amp;B at The Wort from \u00a3800pp including flights.

Loll in a Jacuzzi and watch the steam rise into the night, where mountains form great shapes in the darkness and pine trees bend under the weight of snow. This is deep in fur trader country, but everything from spas to restaurants are within easy walking distance, and cross-country trails start at your cabin door. Where to book: Ski All America (08701 676676, skiallamerica.com) has seven nights at the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge from \u00a3800pp including flights. Further information: skimarmot.com. Canadian Tourism Commission (0906 8715000, travelcanada.ca). Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy This has to be one of the most picturesque mountain resorts. It also has great restaurants, fabulous mountain lunch spots (although you have to book) and access to the enormous Dolomiti Superski area. Food, wine and making merry are as important as the skiing. There are some wonderful hotels such as the grand five- star Miramonti (0039 0436 4201) as well as small well-priced three stars and the odd B&amp;B. Don't miss the Scoiattoli restaurant at the stunning Cinque Torri ski area. For serious gourmets there's the Michelin-starred Tivoli. Italian design dominates on and off the slopes, so don't forget your Gucci sunglasses. Where to book: Hotels and packages are on offer through Momentum Ski (020-7371 9111, momentumski.com).

Verbier, Switzerland Even if most of the bars will be hopping with apr\u00e8s-ski shenanigans, couples can still find candlelit restaurants and quiet piano bars. Le Relais de Pachou, is a small 14-bedroom hotel with a great restaurant just near the free bus route from the town centre. It's quiet, cosy, family-run and costs \u00a340-\u00a350 a night. At the other extreme, Descent International's brand-new Septi\u00e8me Ciel is possibly the most stunning chalet in Verbier. It has six bedrooms and costs from \u00a317,000 for a week. Needless to say, the Veuve Clicquot runs freely while Jacuzzis and massages are on tap. The food even rivals the restaurant Pierroz in the Relais and Chateaux, Rosalp hotel. The skiing is magnificent, too, but not for beginners. I'd be surprised if the view at the top of Mont Fort has not prompted a few proposals; I know that the run off the back has. All very well, but you must be able to ski well enough to get down. For long, lazy lunches, try Chez Dany or the Sonalon. Where to book: Le Relais de Pachou can be booked through Switzerland Tourism (international free phone 00800 10020030); for details check out MySwitzerland.com. Descent International (020-7989 8989).
