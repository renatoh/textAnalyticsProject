The 33-year-old striker Cavani and Telles, a 27-year-old left-back, took Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s major signings to three, Donny van de Beek having previously been bought for \u00a335m. Cavani will provide competition for Anthony Martial at No 9 and aid the development of 18-year-old Mason Greenwood. United also bought the 18-year-old Facundo Pellistri from Atl\u00e9tico Pe\u00f1arol for about \u00a310m and agreed a deal to sign another teenage winger, Amad Traor\u00e9, in January. Cavani said: \u201cI look forward to continuing to write my little story inside the book of football and my focus has to remain the same as always \u2013 work, work, work. I have had a conversation with the manager and this has increased my desire to wear this beautiful shirt.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cHe\u2019ll bring energy, power, leadership and a great mentality but most importantly he\u2019ll bring goals. He has had a brilliant career so far, winning trophies at almost every club he has played for, and he still has so much more to give at the highest level.\u201d Cavani has enjoyed a glittering career, claiming the Golden Boot in Ligue 1 and Serie A, having scored 341 goals at club level since moving to Palmermo in 2007, 35 of these in the Champions League. At Paris Saint-Germain, his last club, Cavani won six league titles, his 200 goals making him their record goalscorer. In 2011 Cavani won the Copa America and has 50 goals in 116 appearances for Uruguay. Going the other way was Chris Smalling, the defender sold to Roma, who filed the requisite paperwork with the Italian football association a minute before the 7pm deadline. The 30-year-old ended a decade at United with a transfer worth \u20ac15m plus \u20ac5m in add-ons, approximately negating the fee paid for Telles. The bid to acquire Sancho finally ended as a result of Dortmund\u2019s \u20ac120m valuation being viewed as unrealistic by United owing to the coronavirus-affected market. But Solskj\u00e6r may have been particularly disappointed in the move for Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 ending in failure because the United manager had identified the position as a priority when the window opened. Traor\u00e9, an 18-year-old, will join from Atalanta for \u20ac20m plus up to \u20ac21m in add-ons in the new year. He had been set to sign for Parma on loan \u2013 the club having announced so on their social media channels \u2013 before United made their move early on deadline day. The Ivorian winger, who scored on his Serie A debut last season, is set to arrive in January with a work permit pending. He has been on the bench for Atalanta\u2019s three league games this season. The Atalanta forward Papu G\u00f3mez recently said of Traor\u00e9: \u201cHe\u2019s a future star, trust me. During our training sessions he plays like Messi! You can\u2019t stop him, he\u2019s unbelievable, our centre-backs have serious problems when Traor\u00e9 is on the pitch ... he\u2019s fantastic!\u201d Solskj\u00e6r described Pellistri as \u201creal talent for the long term\u201d, saying the Uruguayan \u201cis capable of having an impact with his pace and ability to beat his opponent\u201d. Regarding Telles, the manager expressed contentment at the 27-year-old\u2019s acquisition, the Brazilian agreeing a four-year contract with an option of a further one. \u201cFirst and foremost I welcome Alex to United. He is a player we have been tracking for some time and his performances over the past few years are exactly what we are looking for,\u201d the manager said. \u201cHe is a fighter and a winner and will add real determination and competition to the squad. Alex has the qualities, both as a player and as a person, that we want here at Manchester United.\u201d Telles said: \u201cTo join a club with the prestige of Manchester United is a huge honour. You have to work hard to get to this moment in your career and now I am coming to this club I can promise I will give everything in my heart to be a success at Old Trafford.\u201d United also announced the signing from Sochaux of the centre-back Willy Kambwala, who will join the under-18s squad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
