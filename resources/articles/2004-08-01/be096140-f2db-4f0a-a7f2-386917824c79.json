While life is full of stories of friends or lovers who only know each other because they missed the same train or attended the same wedding, we're intolerant of such coincidences in fiction. No such meeting can feel properly accidental because we know the script is willing it as a reason to exist. In When I'm Sixty-Four, a very odd but highly watchable one-off drama, writer Tony Grounds has taken out insurance against contrivance by making Ray (Paul Freeman) a taxi driver in his mid-60s. A cabbie picks up thousands of fares in his life; it feels statistically possible that one of these fleeting meetings might mean something. The trip that trips Ray up is a call to take home Jim (Alun Armstrong) on his last afternoon as a schoolmaster. Grounds, true to his name, is good at fixing characters in details, and it's a nice touch that Jim has taught for 40 years in the same school he attended from the age of eight. With an outwardly cold heart and an openly large nose, he has been known to generations of boys as \"Beaky\". Grounds's subject as a writer is class (he created the impressive Births, Deaths and Marriages) and it seems at first as if Ray and Jim are being set up too starkly as post-Thatcherite chalk and cheese. The taxi driver's weekend hobby as a football hooligan works better as plot surprise than convincing character building and, with Armstrong giving Beaky a delivery that sounds put-on posh, their early scenes have too much a ring of EastEnders meets Mr Chips. The threat of stereotypes recedes, though, because the main tactic in the rest of the script is defeating expectation. When Jim asks Ray to drive him to a private clinic, you suspect that he has a terminal illness - and that the play will be all raging against the dying light - but the only ominous growth he has is his nose, which he wishes to have cosmetically altered with his retirement lump sum. The main surprise Grounds provides for Jim and Ray is so startling that it deserves to be preserved, but it removes any suspicion that this is going to be a positive comedy about two sparky retirees who are glad to be grey. You sometimes feel that Grounds would have had a bigger reputation in the 70s, when strange and gracefully written single plays were treated as an event rather than scripts that failed to become a movie. The dialogue is distinctive and spiky. \"I thought you were going to be one of our 'no visitors' patients,\" a nurse confides with relief to Jim. Working-class Ray, learning that his grandson is being sent to Harrow, complains: \"They're paying for him to hate me.\" After a disastrous start, with last week's Passion Never Dies, about middle-aged dating, BBC2's senior season is settling down. Apart from the play, there's also Would Like to Meet ... Esther. Celebrity editions of hit formats are the bindweed of the TV schedules at present (A Place in the Sun and Mastermind have just had the fame-spray) and this one sounded horrifying in prospect. Four years after the death of her husband, Esther Rantzen had agreed to take part in the dating game-show. This proposal seemed to hold two obvious problems. The power of the reality TV genre comes from preying on people who aren't used to be being on television, and here was someone with three decades of on-screen experience. Also, as Rantzen's major BBC series have petered out in recent years, there was the inevitable suspicion that she was looking for employment rather than love. In fact, this proves to be the most revealing of the star spin-offs since Vanessa Feltz lost control of her emotions in the first Celebrity Big Brother. There's real psychological insight into the effects of fame in seeing Rantzen having to dismantle the layers of television personality in order to date a civilian: at first, she treats the men as guests in some bistro chat-show. Also, unless a brilliant double-bluff is going on, a woman highly skilled in the defences of television seems genuinely willing to drop them: keeping a video diary without make-up on, weeping when surprised by a mention of her husband. For students of the medium, there is a fascination in watching a star made monstrous by television now being humanised by it. By seeking a new man on peak-time TV - or affecting to do so - Rantzen risked humiliation or pity. But a performer who has managed her TV career with great skill turns out to have made another smart choice. Renovation game The basic format of reality TV involves putting strangers in a house and setting them a task. This idea of territorial challenge stretches from what now seem like the innocent beginnings of the genre - in painting-and-building shows such as Changing Places - to its ratings-chomping monsters: Big Brother and Wife Swap. So it was probably inevitable that someone would eventually combine the wallpaper-makeover strain of programming with the domestic-tension one. The makers of Wife Swap have now done so in ITV1's The Block. Advertisers are apparently keen for the main commercial channel to reach a young, middle-class audience and the idea for this series goes straight to the prejudice about that generation's driving obsession: the game-show turns on the question of how much can be added to a house by renovation. The producers have bought four shells of newly built town houses. A young couple has been installed in each of them with a communal pile of tools and a building budget of \u00a325,000. In 12 weeks' time, the houses will be sold at auction with a reserve price of \u00a3300,000. In the opening episode, the couples are told that they will keep any profit over that. But the publicity for the series states that the most profitable house-builders will win a \u00a350,000 prize. Perhaps this change of rules reflects a feeling that the housing market is slumping. In a remarkable departure from the recent rules of reality TV, more than half of the contestants seem to be nice people: one couple are so sweet that they let everyone else take all the tools. As the contestants contemplate bare breezeblock, unplumbed bidets and glassless windows on their first night, this feels like an idea that could build, although the programme is subject to the structural blight that ruins so much reality TV: each commercial break is prefaced by a preview of what will happen and followed by a flashback to what has, as if viewers are so stupid that a couple of adverts for soup and cars empty our minds of their memories. \u00b7 When I'm Sixty-Four, Wednesday, 9pm, BBC2; Would Like to Meet...
