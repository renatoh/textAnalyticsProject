In a twist on the standard bready base, this recipe uses brioche as a nod to French Moroccan cuisine. And I've replaced conventional pork with chicken livers for a slightly different feel. You could also ditch the livers for a yummy veggie version. Moorish in so many ways. Makes enough for a chicken - double it for a turkey and treble for a goose - any over gets cooked in a greased baking tray 300g brioche, torn up 250g shallots, finely chopped 1 small preserved lemon, finely chopped or juice and zest of 1 lemon (definitely worth trying to get the preserved ones) 50g toasted, flaked almonds 60g toasted pistachios \u00bdtsp dried chilli flakes 1tsp cumin seed, toasted 40g fresh coriander, washed and chopped 4tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 150g chicken livers, prepped and very roughly chopped (optional) Combine ingredients in a large bowl. Season well. Tastes even better if left to mingle for a few hours before stuffing the bird. \u00b7 Allegra McEvedy is co-founder of the fast-food chain Leon.
