Below we wrongly suggested that MessageLabs supplies network security for parliamentary computers and is therefore potentially responsible for a Conficker worm outbreak. In fact, MessageLabs provides parliament with messaging security and its service focuses on email threats, not worms like Conficker that infect networks by other means. A trio of news pieces for you. The Conficker worm has got into the Houses of Parliament's network and infected computers there. MPs have been told, in a written answer, that use by them of PGP, the commercial encryption system, is \"not recommended\" on the parliamentary network because it is \"not compatible\" with its current VPN (virtual private network). And, as I write, the database of MPs' expenses is being hawked around to newspapers, for a high price. If you needed any evidence that our legislators, and more particularly those who run their computer networks, are getting a short, sharp course in computer security, then those bits of information on their own would be enough. Let's start with the fact that any computer that could connect to the parliamentary network was actually able to be infected with Conficker. That's a double failure: first, the machine (a Windows PC, obviously) didn't have its Windows Update system turned on. That means that it's either running a version of Windows XP pre-SP2 (when Windows Update was turned on by default), or that it's one of those accursed \"enterprise-managed\" machines, where the admins don't like keeping them up to date because it can break custom programs. (Ignore the fact that your system is insecure; updating it is so much more hassle. Until you get hit, and learn just what hassle really is.) But let's be generous. Let's assume it was a researcher's machine or infected USB stick, rather than an internet connection to the network, that brought Conficker in. But that implies a second failure at the network layer: that whatever antivirus system was running didn't detect Conficker, and so didn't protect the rest of the network against it. Explanations for how this happened are thin on the ground \u2013 in fact, nonexistent \u2013 despite numerous requests for enlightenment from the media to PICT (the parliamentary information and communication technology department). I'm sure people are trying to work out who is going to be hung out to dry for this one, and it's a safe bet that PICT and the antivirus provider are fighting like cats in a bag to make sure the other one shoulders the blame. If I were a backbench MP, I'd feel worried by this development. Conficker may (it's not clear at the time of writing) be able to root around your files and dispatch them across the internet. MPs have a lot of private and sensitive correspondence on their systems; through no fault of their own, the parliamentary network may have put them in breach of the Data Protection Act. And what of privy counsellors, who get access to nationally sensitive information? Was any of that on the compromised systems? But the leakage of the database of expenses shows that things have gone badly awry. Tom Steinberg, founder of MySociety, took some vicarious pleasure from MPs learning the lesson of database security the hard way, ahead of the planned introduction of ID cards. \"The utilitarian in me suggests it's much better to see 650 people slightly burned than millions destroyed,\" he tweeted. Everyone's been very worked up about Jacqui Smith's expenses. True, there's been a lot to get worked up about. But the continued failings of the government, of parliament, and of MPs to protect their own data and systems bodes badly for the future. In a world where MPs are dissuaded from using an important privacy tool, where databases can't be secured, where important networks are open to untrammelled infection \u2013 they want ID cards? Honestly? \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 3 April 2009.
