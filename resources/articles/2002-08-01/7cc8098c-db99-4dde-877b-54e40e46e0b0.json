The successful coach Dusan Bajevic also left, for AEK Athens. There have been repeated calls for Batatoudis's resignation and fans have attacked the club's offices on several occasions. PAOK, one of the country's two most popular teams, have recently signed an agreement with Juventus to exchange players and training methods. The state-owned Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company, whose public face is the son of Col Gadafy, Al-Saadi, owns a 7.5% stake in Juventus. Australia appears to have scored an early own goal in its attempt to host the 2014 World Cup after the Prime Minister John Howard refused to back plans. The premiers of New South Wales and Victoria had joined Fifa's president Sepp Blatter to announce that Australia was to make a formal bid for the finals. But only bids with full government support stand any chance of success, and Howard yesterday ridiculed what he termed a \"Sunday-afternoon PR stunt\". But Howard, who learned of the bid only in yesterday's papers, criticised the two states for failing to consult fully with all interested parties - thereby undermining its weight as a national proposal. \"We are Australians to the rest of the world. We are not New South Wales or Victoria - and what we've got to do is work together in these things.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
