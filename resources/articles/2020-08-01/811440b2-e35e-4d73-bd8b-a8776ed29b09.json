Amid fears that the dispute could widen further, the National Farmers\u2019 Federation told Guardian Australia it had no reason to believe the Chinese government was about to expand its trade investigations beyond Australian barley, red meat and wine. But the federation\u2019s chief executive officer, Tony Mahar, added: \u201cIn the event that this did happen however, it would be important, as with barley, red meat and now wine, that each issue was treated in isolation and on its merits.\u201d Mahar argued that the government and industry needed to \u201cdo all we can to keep the dialogue open between our two nations\u201d \u2013 noting that the trading relationship between Australia and China was vast and diverse. \u201cAs a nation we must continue to nurture and advance these relationships whether it be the export of agricultural commodities, minerals, tourism or education,\u201d he said. Wool, cotton, grain, dairy, seafood and horticulture are among Australia\u2019s top agricultural exports to China. The call to nurture the relationship follows a decision by China\u2019s commerce ministry on Tuesday to investigate allegations that Australian wine had been \u201cdumped\u201d into the Chinese market at artificially low prices. With Australia\u2019s trade minister, Simon Birmingham, revealing he had still been unable to secure talks with his Chinese counterpart despite months of requests, Mahar welcomed the government\u2019s pledge to keep trying. Despite the tensions, Mahar said the China-Australia free trade agreement, which entered into force in 2015, would \u201ccontinue to provide benefits for Australia exporters, including farmers and equally, Chinese consumers for many, many years to come\u201d. The deal had contributed to a 30% increase in agricultural exports since its inception, he said, so \u201cthere is no question of the value of the agreement\u201d. Scott Morrison attempted to appeal to the Chinese government on Wednesday, saying the relationship was \u201ca mutually beneficial one\u201d and that \u201cChina benefits from the high-quality products and services that we provide\u201d. The prime minister played down the immediate impact of the wine announcement, noting that the investigation could last up to 18 months. While the government would work with the industry to contest the dumping claims, he said it would \u201cnever trade away our sovereignty in Australia on any issue\u201d. \u201cWe will be consistent, we will be clear, we will be respectful and we will get on with the business,\u201d the prime minister said. But Labor\u2019s agriculture spokesperson, Joel Fitzgibbon, accused Morrison of being \u201cto blame\u201d for the deteriorating relationship. Fitzgibbon said the government had caused unnecessary offence to China by calling for a global Covid-19 inquiry \u201cwhen there was always going to be an inquiry\u201d. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a big gorilla,\u201d Fitzgibbon said in a radio interview with 2CC on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s our major trading partner, our largest export market, and it\u2019s angry and it\u2019s going to punish us.\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry argued the anti-dumping investigation followed a complaint from the Chinese wine industry in July and would be carried out \u201cin a legal, fair and just manner\u201d. At a regular press briefing the spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said a sound and stable relationship was in both countries\u2019 interests \u201cbut it calls for the joint efforts of both sides\u201d. When asked whether it was a coincidence that the investigation came several months after the Chinese ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, said people might reconsider drinking Australian wine if relations soured, he replied: \u201cThis is a normal anti-dumping investigation. There\u2019s no need to read too much into it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
