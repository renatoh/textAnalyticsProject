The video showed five men wearing headscarves and black ski masks, standing over a bound man in an orange boiler suit - similar to a prisoner's uniform - who identified himself as Nick Berg, a US civilian contractor whose body was found near a highway overpass in Baghdad on Saturday. \"My name is Nick Berg, my father's name is Michael, my mother's name is Suzanne,\" the man said on the video. \"I have a brother and sister, David and Sarah. I live in ... Philadelphia.\" After reading a statement, the men were seen pulling the man to his side and putting a large knife to his neck. A scream sounded as the men cut his head off, shouting \"Allahu Akbar!\" - \"God is great.\" They then held the head out before the camera. Mr Berg, 26, of Philadelphia suburb West Chester, owned a communications equipment company, and went to Iraq to find work rebuilding antennas, his mother, Suzanne Berg, said. He had been missing since April 9. The military confirmed that an American civilian was found dead in Baghdad, but did not release his name. The military said there were signs of trauma to the body. Suzanne Berg said she was told her son's death was violent but did not want to discuss details. The men in the video said the killing was revenge against abuse and humiliation carried out by US guards at Abu Ghraib prison, west of Baghdad. \"For the mothers and wives of American soldiers, we tell you that we offered the US administration to exchange this hostage with some of the detainees in Abu Ghraib and they refused,\" one of the men read from a statement. \"So we tell you that the dignity of the Muslim men and women in Abu Ghraib and others is not redeemed except by blood and souls. You will not receive anything from us but coffins... (of people) slaughtered in this way.\" The video bore the title \"Abu Musab al-Zarqawi shown slaughtering an American.\" It was unclear whether al-Zarqawi - a lieutenant of Osama bin Laden - was shown in the video, or was claiming responsibility for ordering the execution. \"How can a free Muslim sleep well as he sees Islam slaughtered and its dignity bleeding, and the pictures of shame and the news of the devilish scorn of the people of Islam - men and women - in the prison of Abu Ghraib?\" the speaker said on the video. The website on which the video was posted is known as a clearing house for al-Qaida and Islamic extremist groups' statements and tapes. An audiotape purportedly from bin Laden - which the CIA said was probably authentic - appeared on the same site last week. Western officials say al-Zarqawi, whose real name is Ahmad Fadhil al-Khalayleh, is a key aide to bin Laden. The United States has offered US$10 million for information leading to the capture or killing of al-Zarqawi, saying he is trying to build a network of foreign militants in Iraq to work for al-Qaida. In the video, the speaker threatened both US President George Bush and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. \"As for you Bush ... expect severe days. You and your soldiers will regret the day you stepped into the land of Iraq,\" he said. He described Mr Musharraf as \"a traitor agent.\" Mr Berg was in Baghdad from late December to February 1 and returned to Iraq in March. He failed to find work and planned again to return home on March 30, but his daily communications with his family stopped on March 24. He later told his parents he was jailed by Iraqi officials at a checkpoint in the northern city of Mosul. On April 5, the Bergs filed a lawsuit in federal court in Philadelphia, contending that their son was being held illegally by the US military. The next day Mr Berg was released. He told his parents he had not been mistreated. The Bergs last heard from their son April 9, when he said he would come home by way of Jordan, Turkey or Kuwait. Suzanne Berg said the family had been trying for weeks to learn where her son was but that federal officials had not been helpful. \"I went through this with them for weeks,\" she said. \"I basically ended up doing most of the investigating myself.\" April 9 was also the day that seven American contractors working for a subsidiary of Halliburton Corporation and two military men were unaccounted for after their supply convoy was attacked on the outskirts of Baghdad. Four of the Halliburton workers and one of the military men have since been confirmed dead. Halliburton worker Thomas Hamill escaped his captors May 2 and returned home to Mississippi on Saturday. The other two Halliburton workers and the other soldier remain missing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
