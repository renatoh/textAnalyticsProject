The British driver produced another fine race in the Spanish grand prix and looked certain to finish second behind Mark Webber, who led throughout, until on the penultimate lap his front left tyre gave way to suspected wheel-rim or possibly suspension trouble and he crashed out. \"It was a similar feeling to what happened at the N\u00fcrburgring,\" said Hamilton. \"This is my third or fourth tyre blow-out in my career, more than most people have in their whole lifetime. But there was no warning, the car felt great, so it was a surprise and a very disappointing end to the race. \"Up until that point it was pretty positive. I was just cruising to the finish line and heading for some great points. It was looking like a great job for us but then it's never over until its over. Eighteen points and I'd have been right back in the championship battle but, as it is, I'm a little bit further back now. \"So I'm absolutely blown away that something happened on the last two laps of the race but that's motor racing.\" Those 18 points he would have garnered here would have lifted him to second place in the championship, one behind his McLaren team-mate Jenson Button, who was fifth. Instead the 2008 world champion Hamilton is now back in sixth place, 21 points behind his fellow Briton, and also in the title-chasing slipstream of Fernando Alonso, Sebastian Vettel, Webber, Nico Rosberg and Felipe Massa. In all five races Hamilton has been stalked by some kind of misfortune or another, whether it has been qualifying cock-ups, poor pit calls or mechanical failure; he must feel as neurotic as a dartboard. If he drove less brilliantly here than he had done in Shanghai three weeks earlier, that was partly because the Circuit de Catalunya, with its shortened back straight, virtually bans overtaking and that encouraged the 33-year-old Australian Webber to lead from lights to flag in his galloping Red Bull to record his first victory of the season and the third of his career. In a city infamous for the slickness of its pickpockets Alonso produced a neat piece of larceny, taking advantage of the problems that beset Hamilton and Vettel to come second, ahead of Vettel and Michael Schumacher, who showed something of his old skill to shut the door on Button. Button, though, was later critical of Schumacher, who overtook him on the 17th lap. \"I didn't really know where Michael was on the outside of me,\" said the reigning world champion. \"He turned in and, if I didn't back out of it, we would have crashed. It's tough to overtake here and Michael's not silly. He knows where to put his car, so on a track like this you're not going to overtake him.\" Yesterday, sadly, the rain in Spain stayed mainly in the plain. The wet weather had brought so much excitement to the previous three races but its absence now resulted in what was little more than a procession. Yawns, though, were stifled when Hamilton managed to split the Red Bulls of Webber and Vettel, nipping ahead of the German after a tyre change. Vettel tried to retake Hamilton but, with a Virgin backmarker Lucas di Grassi also in the mix, Hamilton responded brilliantly and the Red Bull driver went off the track. The day, though, belonged to Webber. Shortly before the engines roared he said he wanted a boring race and he duly delivered it. The Australian was overshadowed by his thrillingly fast young team-mate Vettel in the build-up to the season. But they now have one win apiece and have shared all the pole positions (three for Vettel, two for Webber). This was the first time this season that a pole winner had won the race, though the tenth time it has happened here in as many seasons; when it is dry in Barcelona dullness beckons like a pot of beige paint. In Spain the stroll \u2013 or paseo as they call it in these parts \u2013 is something of an institution. This, too, was a stroll for Webber. Once he and Vettel had got through the first corner \u2013 though Hamilton and Alonso did their best to force their way through \u2013 it was unlikely that they would be challenged and only problems with Vettel's car prevented the Red Bull one-two the team had achieved in qualifying the previous day. Over the last few laps the German had almost total brake failure and was glad to hold on to third Because the drivers test here in the winter they know it better than any other track. It is as familiar as an old pullover. And in view of the fact that three of the previous five races here had produced just two overtaking manoeuvres it was never likely to be a thriller in dry conditions. But that did nothing to erase the pure joy on Webber's face. Even the spires on Barcelona's magnificent La Sagrada Fam\u00edlia could not have been higher. \"I'm rapt,\" he said. \"After qualifying yesterday it was a great position to start the race. \"It was quite tight into turn one and we had a good battle through there but then I settled into a rhythm after that. I always try to do something different if I win a race and I threw my helmet into the crowd. It's nice to give them a gift.\" But for British fans and even some neutrals the continuing despair of Hamilton was a cause of disappointment. Formula One's return to Europe was not a memorable one. The glamour of Monaco next weekend promises more \u2013 but maybe not in the race."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
