The vote \u2013 triggered after former Labour MP Fiona Onasanya was ousted under recall rules following her conviction for lying over a speeding offence \u2013 had been touted as a perfect opportunity for Nigel Farage\u2019s newly formed party to build on their success in the European elections and prove they\u2019re a force to be reckoned with in Westminster. In the end, they fell short \u2013 with Labour retaining the seat, their candidate Lisa Forbes beat the Brexit party candidate Mike Greene by 683 votes. Brexit party officials put their narrow defeat down to a lack of data and Labour having more time to prepare. The number of votes the party received is impressive for a new party but given the high expectations following the European elections the overall sense is one of disappointment. The fact that they failed to clinch the seat is a reminder of the difficulty smaller parties face in a first-past-the-post general election system. It\u2019s something Farage knows well. He himself has sought Westminster election seven times in the past 25 years without success. But Farage doesn\u2019t even need to win elections with the Brexit party to cause the Tories serious damage. In the Peterborough byelection, the Conservative party came in third \u2013 at 7,243 votes to the Brexit party\u2019s 9,801. This seat has long been a Labour/Tory marginal \u2013 one the Conservatives held from 2005 to 2017 when Labour narrowly took it back in the snap election. Now the Tories are struggling to stay in contention. If the UK has not left the EU by the time of the next general election, Farage has vowed that the Brexit party will field candidates and destroy the two-party system. Should he fail to go the whole hog, the Brexit party need only attract a couple of thousand votes in Labour/Tory marginals to successfully eat into the Conservative vote and allow Labour to come out on top. This is a scenario that has worried Tory MPs in leave areas ever since the Brexit party launched. Analysis by Electoral Calculus said that if a general election were called the Tories would lose 59 seats and Labour would become the largest party in the Commons. This is in part because in areas such as Walsall North \u2013 a heavily leave area which the Tories won from Labour in 2017 \u2013 the Brexit party would take such a chunk out of the Conservative vote that Labour would waltz through the middle. The Peterborough byelection result will only increase such fears. So, how will the Conservative party respond? An outright victory for the Brexit party in Peterborough would have been heralded as a win for Boris Johnson in the leadership contest, with Tory MPs most likely to turn to him to \u2013 as he told MPs on Tuesday \u2013 put \u201cFarage back in his box\u201d. A narrow win for Labour doesn\u2019t take away the threat of the Brexit party \u2013 but it does allow other candidates space to put forward their own pitches for tackling the Brexit party threat. When I chaired the One Nation Tory caucus hustings on Tuesday night, Sajid Javid got one of the loudest cheers of the night when he declared that the Tories would not beat Farage by becoming the Brexit party. Expect Javid and other candidates like Matt Hancock to argue that this shows the party does not need to match Farage\u2019s party wholesale. Given the threat of a Brexit party coming in even second place poses for the Tories, the result will still send ripples through the leadership contest. In order to combat this, every Tory leadership hopeful agrees on the need to avoid a general election until after the UK has left the EU. The hope is that delivering some form of Brexit will be enough to significantly reduce the threat from Farage. However, delivering Brexit with no majority in the Commons and Brussels reluctant to renegotiate is no easy task. When it comes to the leadership contest, there is a new premium on any candidate who is able to convince their colleagues that they are up to the task: delivering Brexit while avoiding an election in the process. \u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
