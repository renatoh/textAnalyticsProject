The scene where Elliot drapes a sheet over ET to take him trick or treating, on the one night of the year when a small waddling alien can count on blending into the crowd, opened what had previously been a closed book. Bigger boys did occasionally turn up and smash an egg on our doormat on 31 October, for reasons not entirely clear. But the huge, overblown ritual my son has grown up with \u2013 elaborately carved pumpkins, plastic tombstones planted in front gardens, tiny sugar-crazed witches hammering the doorbell for three hours straight \u2013 was unheard of in rural Essex in the 1980s. Trick or treating was rumoured to exist, but my mum said it was American and we had no answer to that. Being British meant Bonfire Night, or an hour shivering on the playing field drinking scalding-hot packet soup from a plastic cup while someone failed to get a Catherine wheel going, which formally ended only when sparks from the bonfire set the first bobble hat smouldering. Good times. Except the reverse, it seems, is true. Halloween in its briskly commercialised modern form, where children still chant \u201ctrick or treat\u201d but really just mean \u201chand over the Haribo\u201d, may be a relatively recent American import (with elements of Mexico\u2019s day of the dead now creeping in at the edges). But it\u2019s rooted in a less saccharine 15th-century British tradition surrounding All Hallows\u2019 Eve, of going house to house asking for \u201csoul-cakes\u201d in memory of the dead or in return for praying for their souls. Over the years it has fused with everything from the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when bonfires were lit to ward off evil spirits, to the more anarchic British tradition of Mischief Night pranks on 4 November and an overwhelming American lust for candy which has removed some of the original menace. Although the hulking teenage trick or treaters we used to get in south London, who didn\u2019t want sweets so much as a fiver in return for not keying the car, were maybe sticking to a more purist tradition. Conversely, Guy Fawkes Night feels as if it\u2019s been solemnly handed down through the ages, yet public marking of the plot to blow up parliament seems to have fallen into decline for a while during the 19th century. We aren\u2019t celebrating something set in stone so much as an ever-evolving mishmash of traditions cheerfully stolen from all over the place, a timely hint both that British culture has never been a monolith and that these festivals are celebrating something much more universal. These things we do on the brink of winter fill a very human need, as the clocks go back and the chill sets in, to huddle together and hold off the coming darkness just a little longer. Fireworks may be hell for dogs and the nervously inclined, but there\u2019s something inexplicably satisfying about burning one last hole in the night sky with a sparkler, just as there is about running around knocking on neighbours\u2019 doors before the long cold months of hunkering down inside. This year of all years, there is perhaps a greater need than usual to light up the midwinter gloom, heading into what could be a very dark January. Moaning about Halloween not being what it used to be seems almost petty in the circumstances. Or that\u2019s my excuse, anyway. Thanks to exceptionally poor parenting, I forgot all about the pumpkin until late on 31 October, by which time everywhere had sold out. All that remained was to hack a face into the only thing in the fridge big enough to hold a candle. \u201cGosh, a pineapple, how innovative,\u201d said a visiting parent, politely. Close friends were, inevitably, blunter. But posting my fruit-based shame on Twitter unearthed a whole community of last-minute Halloween chancers out there, frantically disembowelling watermelons and scrawling faces on satsumas with Sharpies. Magnificently, someone\u2019s dad once did his best with an emergency potato. Clearly these are the survival skills a nation may yet need in a hard Brexit. But more importantly, they\u2019re a reminder that the celebrations that didn\u2019t exactly go to plan are the ones families often remember most fondly. When darkness is falling, and the match is struck, all you see is the light."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
