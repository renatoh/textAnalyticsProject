The plant designs and builds wings for the European plane-maker's fleet of aircraft. It emerged as the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and French president, Jacques Chirac, tried yesterday to quell the power struggle between the countries that has forced a rethink of radical plans to restructure Airbus and restore profitability with cost cuts of \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.3bn) a year. Alistair Darling, the industry secretary - who met German the economy minister, Michael Glos, in Berlin on Wednesday - is seeking guarantees that Filton will have a key role in designing composite carbon-fibre wings for the new A350 long-haul jet and a new generation of the best-selling A320 single-aisle planes. Industry and union sources dismissed reports that Filton, which employs some 6,000, would be sold off or even closed under the so-called Power8 restructuring plans drawn up by Louis Gallois, Airbus's chief executive. These, due to be announced this week, were redrafted after a Franco-German boardroom clash at EADS, which owns Airbus, and are now expected in the next few days. It is stressed in Whitehall that Filton has enough work for five years because of Airbus's booming backlog of orders. But ministers are concerned that new composite wing technology for future aircraft will be centred in Germany and Spain, with EADS deciding against a new \u00a3100m technology centre in Bristol. France and Germany have also clashed over the division of the future technology workload. UK unions concede that Filton and Broughton, the north Wales plant assembling Airbus wings and employing around 7,000, will both lose hundreds of jobs under the plans to cut about 10,000 overall in Europe. But senior officials insist that Filton's longer term future can be assured by bringing in risk-sharing partners such as GKN which already collaborates with Airbus on new composite technology. Ms Merkel and Mr Chirac called at an informal summit north of Berlin for \"a balance in terms of jobs, technologies and competencies\" to be guaranteed in the four affected countries. Ms Merkel made plain that France and Germany, which together own 45% of EADS, should gain the lion's share of work on new technologies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
