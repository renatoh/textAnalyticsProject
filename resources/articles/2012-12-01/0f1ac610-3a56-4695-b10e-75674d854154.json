Since 1969 she led the changing lineups of Steeleye Span, and for the past 25 years has also made regular appearances with those classy exponents of early English music, the Carnival Band. They are on tour together again this month, supporting this Best Of set compiled from seven previous albums. It starts with a reworking of well-worn Christmas carols, with I Saw Three Ships now given a cheerfully gutsy makeover with whistles and bagpipes, While Shepherds Watched treated to an elegant, courtly setting, and Angels from the Realms of Glory transformed into a fiddle- and guitar-backed dance tune. Then there's an elegant treatment of The Boar's Head, featuring the shawm, a medieval reed instrument, and sturdy a cappella vocal harmonies on the American spiritual Poor Little Jesus. Prior is in cool, clear voice throughout."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
