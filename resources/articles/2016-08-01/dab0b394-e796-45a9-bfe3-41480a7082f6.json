Declaring \u201cthis may be our last chance to find the truth\u201d Ban Ki-moon sent a note to the general assembly, saying there were enough unanswered questions arising from the crash to warrant further investigation and that the responses of the UK, US and Belgium (the major powers in the region at the time) to a UN request for archive material \u201cdo not appear to alter\u201d that conclusion. In particular Ban noted that the UK had stuck to its position last year that it had no further documentation to show the UN investigation. He appended a letter sent in June by the British permanent representative to the UN, Matthew Rycroft, saying \u201cour position remains the same and we are not able to release the materials in question without any redactions\u201d. Rycroft added \u201cthe total amount of information withheld is very small and most of the redactions only consist of a few words\u201d. The wording of the letter echoed a similar letter, turning down the UN request for more information, the UK sent in June 2015, which said that \u201cno pertinent material\u201d had been found in a \u201csearch across all relevant UK departments\u201d. In reply the UN legal counsel, Miguel de Serpa Soares, reminded Rycroft of the shared responsibility of the UN and its member states \u201cto pursue the full truth\u201d about Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s death, and asked him to confirm that the search of \u201call relevant UK departments\u201d included security and intelligence agencies. In reply, Rycroft simply quoted the former UK foreign secretary Philip Hammond telling parliament that the foreign office had \u201ccoordinated a search across all relevant UK government departments\u201d. \u201cI think the British response is extraordinary. It\u2019s very brisk and curt and evasive,\u201d said Susan Williams, a British historian at the School of Advanced Study, University of London, whose book Who Killed Hammarskj\u00f6ld: The UN, the Cold War and White Supremacy in Africa, revealed new evidence that helped persuade the UN to open a new investigation into the crash near Ndola, in what was then the British colony of Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia. Part of that evidence was a report from a British intelligence officer, Neil Ritchie, who was in the area at the time of the crash and who was trying to organise a meeting between Hammarskj\u00f6ld and a rebel leader from neighbouring Congo, where the UN secretary general was trying to broker a truce. \u201cThis was British territory and they had a man on the ground. It doesn\u2019t make them responsible for the crash but it does indicate they knew a lot of what was going on,\u201d Williams said, adding it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that Ritchie\u2019s report which she found in an archive at Essex University, was the only British intelligence report coming the area at the time. In suggesting that the UN investigation continues under \u201can eminent person or persons\u201d chosen by the general assembly or himself, Ban said: \u201cSeeking a complete understanding of the circumstances is our solemn duty to my illustrious and distinguished predecessor, Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, to the other members of the party accompanying him, and to their families.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
