Here is a summary of the main developments this afternoon: Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories have announced new policies for veterans as the country marks Remembrance Sunday. Labour promised them free education and retraining, more apprenticeships, better medical care and homes reserved for ex-armed forces personnel who have been sleeping rough. The Lib Dems proposed scrapping settlement fees for veterans born outside the UK, while the Tories pledged to make veterans eligible for a railcard, giving them one-third off fares. The chancellor, Sajid Javid\u2019s claims that Labour has \u201creckless\u201d plans to spend \u00a31.2tn in the next parliament have been derided as a fiction. The figure includes motions passed at the Labour conference, unlikely to be included in the party\u2019s election manifesto, which has yet to be published. Labour\u2019s co-national campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne called the figures \u201cfiction\u201d, promising the party\u2019s manifesto would be fully costed. Javid refused to reveal costings for the Tory manifesto. Javid is reportedly keen to hold a head-to-head debate with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, about their parties\u2019 spending plans, which Labour sources said they were happy to see go ahead. The business minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, has insisted Boris Johnson was correct in arguing that businesses in Northern Ireland will not have to fill in forms to export goods to the rest of the UK after Brexit, despite this being an apparent part of the departure deal. Kwarteng said the PM was \u201cabsolutely on the money\u201d when he told Northern Irish exporters last week they would not need to fill in extra paperwork, prompting accusations Johnson was misleading the public. The former cabinet minister, Brian Mawhinney, has died aged 79 after a long illness. The Tory peer served as the party\u2019s chairman from 1995 to 1997. He was also minister of state for the Department of Health and secretary of state for transport. He was knighted in 1997 and created a life peer in 2005. The Green party\u2019s co-leader, Jonathan Bartley, has said he believes it is set for its biggest vote ever, as despite movement on the climate crisis by other parties, it is still leading the way. \u201cThe size of the proposals for climate by Labour are just a quarter of the size of what we are proposing in terms of our Green New Deal,\u201d he said. We know polls are notoriously unreliable and it\u2019s very early days in the election but I\u2019m going to chuck this in anyway, just for fun. The Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent, Richard Partington, has explained how the Tories arrived at the \u00a31.2tn, five-year figure they attributed to Labour\u2019s spending plans. As well as making the point that Labour has not yet released its manifesto and that the figure has deliberately been summed up for five years to make it look \u201cmore dramatic\u201d, he writes: The Conservatives\u2019 suggestion is that Labour\u2019s spending plans would push up the annual budget deficit \u2013 the gap between government income and expenditure \u2013 and national debt. This would then lead to spending cuts or the levying of higher taxes to bring the public finances back under control. However, the analysis appears to take little account of any benefits the higher spending could deliver for the public purse or public wellbeing. After a decade of austerity there has been growing public clamour for higher spending on services. Although nationalisation could come with a hefty price tag it would mean taking control of profit-generating assets. Labour has said this would mean the policy effectively paying for itself over time. Javid also promised to significantly raise spending and borrowing levels. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said both Labour and the Tories would lift state spending to 1970s levels. According to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, Britain\u2019s oldest independent economics research organisation, Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal could cost the UK economy as much as \u00a370bn over the next 10 years. My colleague, Heather Stewart, has written a story about Labour\u2019s response to the Tory accusation, carried on the front page of many Sunday papers, that its policies would cost \u00a31.2tn. Labour\u2019s election coordinator, Andrew Gwynne, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: Look, this is an absolute work of fiction by the Conservatives. You can\u2019t trust a word that [Boris] Johnson and his ministers say on this issue. We will have a fully costed manifesto in due course when we launch that. And you know, the challenge is actually for the Conservatives to fully cost their own manifesto, something they didn\u2019t do in 2017. Here are details of the package of measures Labour is pledging for veterans as the country marks Remembrance Sunday. With the climate emergency moving up the political agenda \u2013 although not high enough for many \u2013 does the Green party face a battle to persuade people it is the only party tackling the crisis? Both Caroline Lucas, the party\u2019s sole MP, and its co-leader, Jonathan Bartley, have insisted that when it comes to the most meaningful response, the Greens still lead the way. Bartley said he believes his party will secure the biggest Green vote ever in the upcoming general election. Speaking to BBC 5 Live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics (quotes from PA Media), Bartley said: I think at this election we\u2019re seeing climate change right up there at the top of the agenda. We think we\u2019re going to see the biggest Green vote ever. Discussing the other major parties\u2019 climate policies, he added: The size of the proposals for climate by Labour are just a quarter of the size of what we are proposing in terms of our Green New Deal. We know that we\u2019re going to have to make this investment and we\u2019re going to have to make it quickly. And the more quickly we make it, the more we\u2019re going to save in the long run. Earlier, Lucas said people should vote Green because the party is leading the way and others are following. It will hold the other parties\u2019 \u201cfeet to the fire\u201d on the issue, she told Andrew Marr. Parties have announced policies to assist armed forces veterans as the country marks Remembrance Sunday. The Lib Dems are proposing to scrap settlement fees for veterans who were born outside the UK, the Tories are making veterans eligible for a railcard, giving them one-third off fares, while Labour is pledging that PTSD suffered by veterans will be treated as seriously as physical illness. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has accused Labour of \u201creckless\u201d plans to spend \u00a31.2tn in the next parliament, although the Tories\u2019 analysis was debunked by the opposition and commentators. The figure includes motions passed at the Labour conference, unlikely to be included in the party\u2019s election manifesto, which has yet to be published. Labour\u2019s co-national campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne called the figures \u201cfiction\u201d, promising the party\u2019s manifesto would be fully costed. Javid refused to reveal costings for the Tory manifesto. The former cabinet minister, Brian Mawhinney, has died aged 79 after a long illness. The Tory peer served as the party\u2019s chairman from 1995 to 1997. He was also minister of state for the Department of Health and secretary of state for transport. He was knighted in 1997 and created a life peer in 2005. The business minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, has insisted Boris Johnson was correct in arguing that businesses in Northern Ireland will not have to fill in forms to export goods to the rest of the UK after Brexit, despite this being an apparent part of the departure deal. Kwarteng said the PM was \u201cabsolutely on the money\u201d when he told Northern Irish exporters last week they would not need to fill in extra paperwork, prompting accusations Johnson was misleading the public. With it being Remembrance Sunday, political leaders have joined those at the Cenotaph paying tribute to tribute to those killed in past conflicts. The parties have also announced policies to help veterans. The Lib Dems are proposing to scrap settlement fees for armed forces veterans who were born outside the UK. The Tories have said veterans will be eligible for a railcard giving them a third off the cost of train travel. Labour is pledging that PTSD suffered by veterans will be treated as seriously as physical illness. The former cabinet minister, Brian Mawhinney, has died aged 79 after a long illness, his family said. From PA Media: Lord Mawhinney, who served as Tory party chairman from 1995 to 1997 under Sir John Major\u2019s government, died on Saturday evening. In a statement, his family said: \u201cHis death brings an end to a life dedicated to public service and rooted in an unwavering Christian faith. \u201cHe was a much loved husband, father and grandfather and a friend to many. He will be much missed.\u201d He was elected MP for Peterborough in 1979 and later represented North West Cambridgeshire, retiring in 2005, and was a member of the cabinet from 1994 until 1997. During that time he served as minister of state for the Department of Health and secretary of state for transport. He was knighted in 1997 and created a life peer in 2005. Lord Mawhinney also served as Football League chairman for seven years from 2003. During his time at the helm of the sporting body, he introduced the fit and proper persons test for prospective club directors and the publication of club spending on agents\u2019 fees. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has blamed the \u201cmachinery of government\u201d for the delay in publishing a report by the intelligence and security committee examining Russian influence in British politics. From PA Media: Chairman of the committee Dominic Grieve had previously accused the government of \u201csitting on the report\u201d and said it was sent to the PM for approval on 17 October. Speaking on BBC 5 Live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics, Shapps said he was \u201cnot close\u201d to the report. When asked why it had not been published, he said: \u201cLet me just explain how these things work within government at this moment in time as you come up to an election. \u201cI wanted to publish some very trivial information, which was certainly not of any great, huge public interest, and I was blocked from doing so by the civil service machine because come an election you not allowed to, into purdah, publish things which are seen as controversial in any way. So I suspect it\u2019s just the machinery of government.\u201d He added: \u201cI just think as soon as you get to anything, as in the same way as spending plans and all the rest of it, they (civil service machine) will block almost any publishing come an election and I suspect that\u2019s all that\u2019s happened here, which is then being turned into \u2018oh well, there must be something here\u2019 when it\u2019s actually probably just the usual way that purdah, as it\u2019s called, works.\u201d Earlier, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, said the report\u2019s publication had been \u201ctimed out because of the election\u201d. Amid much debate about spending, the Mirror\u2019s political editor says a TV debate between Sajid Javid and John McDonnell could be on the cards, although claims the chancellor may not be as keen as he\u2019s making out \u2026 Here is an analysis by BBC Reality Check on Sajid Javid\u2019s claims about Labour spending: The chancellor, Sajid Javid, was reluctant to be drawn on the Conservatives\u2019 spending plans this morning but had plenty to say about Labour\u2019s. My colleague, Peter Walker, has written up Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s interview on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, and the business minister\u2019s insistence Boris Johnson was correct in saying Northern Ireland businesses will not have to fill in forms to export goods to the rest of the UK after Brexit. If you refresh the page, I have added some videos from Andrew Marr\u2019s interviews with Andrew Gwynne, Caroline Lucas and Sajid Javid. You are borrowing more and spending more, Marr tells Javid. He quotes a past comment in which the chancellor stressed the importance of living within his means. The chancellor once again criticises Labour\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d spending plans. Will there be an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory party? There will be an inquiry in Islamophobia and it will start this year, says Javid boldly. But asked to clarify, he says it will be a general inquiry into prejudice. Why is the ISC report into Russian interference not being published? \u201cI think it\u2019s been timed out because of the election,\u201d the chancellor answers. Are you sure no Russian money is pulling the strings in this election? I am confident with respect to my own party, says Javid. And that concludes the interview. Marr asks Javid how the Tories are going to fund all their spending plans. The IFS says we\u2019re going to be spending more than we\u2019re bringing in by \u00a350bn under the Conservatives over the next few years. Javid says what comes in in taxes will match the day-to-day spending. We may borrow \u00a320bn to fund capital investments \u201cbut we can afford to do that\u201d. Marr suggests to the chancellor that higher taxes will be necessary. Javid disagrees. He claims the Tories will increase capital expenditure in a \u201ccontrolled manner\u201d unlike Labour \u2013 at which Marr admonishes him for once again trying to get the conversation on to Labour\u2019s plans. Marr asks about the failure of the government to publish the impact of its Brexit deal. We\u2019re talking about something like \u00a372bn in extra borrowing, suggests Marr. That\u2019s not the figure, says Javid. The Bank of England said there would be growth every year, the chancellor says. \u201cThese numbers that you set out I don\u2019t recognise.\u201d Marr challenges Javid for saying he doesn\u2019t recognise the numbers, while not producing his own. Javid utters a soundbite about getting Brexit done. Marr asks about Moody\u2019s downgrading the UK\u2019s credit outlook. Javid says the downgrade is because of the paralysis in parliament and the only way to end that is to return a Conservative majority in parliament. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, is on Marr now. Marr suggests the \u00a31.2tn the Tories claim Labour will spend during the next parliament is \u201cbogus\u201d. \u201cNot at all,\u201d says Javid. Marr says you\u2019ve taken all Labour conference motions and assumed they will implement them straight away. Javid says every single costing has come from Labour\u2019s own figures, independent sources \u2026 or we have worked them out ourselves. You\u2019ve been very unfair, says Marr. This is the true cost of Corbyn\u2019s Labour, says Javid. He continues to stand by the analysis. Marr asks if the Tories will raise the threshold for National Insurance contributions. Javid says he\u2019s not going to set out manifesto commitments. Marr counters that this is something Boris Johnson has promised. Javid says he believes in low tax. Marr says you seem more familiar with Labour\u2019s manifesto than your own. What about inheritance tax? Javid again declines to comment on the Tory manifesto, taking the discussion back to the Labour manifesto. The Green MP, Caroline Lucas, is on Marr now. She\u2019s asked whether the Remain Alliance electoral pact, in 60 seats, can make a difference. She says that it can given that it we are probably heading for a hung parliament. They wanted Labour to be included she says but it was not possible. Marr asks about the \u00a3100bn a year the Greens have committed to \u201cgreening the economy\u201d and the economic impact. Lucas says that would make the UK a net-zero economy by 2030. The government target of 2050 is not good enough. She says it will pay for itself as it will generate jobs and cut health costs. Marr asks Lucas when she last flew. She says she flies as her son lives in the United States. She says \u201csystems change\u201d is important, we shouldn\u2019t focus on individual\u2019s actions and \u2018sitting in judgement on each other\u201d. Does there need to be an end to factory farming? Yes, says Lucas, stressing there needs to be a shift away from industrialised agriculture towards more eco-friendly practices. Marr suggests it is a problem for Greens that other parties, particularly Labour, are moving in the same direction on the climate emergency. Lucas says that voters should realise why they are moving in that direction - because of the Greens who will continue to hold their feet to the fire. She also says that last week there was someone on the show claiming that regional airport expansion is consistent with curbing the climate crisis. Moving swiftly onto BBC One, where Andrew Marr is interviewing the shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne. He is asked about how Labour would get its Brexit deal through the party and the Commons. Gwynne says there has to be compromise, which there hasn\u2019t been so far. He says the way to do it is to let the people decide (through a second referendum). It will be the people, not the politicians that decide. We are the only party offering that. Marr asks whether comments by Jeremy Corbyn last week amounted to preserving free movement. Gwynne says there will be \u201cbespoke arrangements\u201d and refers to \u201creciprocal agreements\u201d with the EU that will allow both British and EU citizens to continue to enjoy benefits such as participation in the Erasmus scheme. Marr asks whether the Labour manifesto will say that freedom of movement will end after Brexit, as it said in 2017. Gwynne tells Marr to ask him next week when the manifesto is published. The Lib Dems\u2019 Home Affairs spokeswoman, Christine Jardine, is being quizzed by Sophy Ridge now. Jardine is asked about the Remain Alliance electoral pact in 60 seats. Is that a kick in the teeth for voters? You\u2019re saying Brexit trumps everything? Jardine says Brexit does trump everything. \u201cIt\u2019s sucking the lifeblood out of everything in this country\u201d. Only then can other issues be tackled, she says. Jardine is asked about whether the Lib Dems are just trying to hang on to existing seats in Scotland. She answers in the negative and says the important distinction between the Lib Dems and the SNP (both remain parties) is that the Lib Dems are against the uncertainty that another independence referendum would bring. If you refresh the page, I have added some videos of Kwasi Kwarteng, Ian Blackford and Nia Griffith on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News. The last question put to Griffith by Ridge is why can\u2019t Labour shake off the antisemitism allegations? Griffith says: \u201cWe do need to make sure we stamp this out in the party.\u201d She says Labour is making sure it takes action and investigates. The shadow defence secretary, Nia Griffith, is on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, back over on Sky. Ridge shows her polling that shows, in ex-industrial towns, Labour was well ahead in 2017 but is now trailing the Tories. She says the polling also shows the only areas where Labour is ahead is core cities. Griffith says: \u201cThis is a snapshot now.\u201d She believes there will be a change in polls over the next couple of weeks. Griffith is asked about the Tory claim that Labour\u2019s spending plans will cost the UK \u00a31.2tn over five years. These figures have come from \u201cabsolutely nowhere\u201d, says Griffith. She says when the Labour manifesto is published it will be fully costed, as it was in 2017. Griffith claims the Tories are trying to detract from the Labour manifesto, which will be far more exciting than the Conservatives. Ridge asks, on Remembrance Sunday, whether Labour would ever intervene in foreign conflicts. Griffith replies: There are going to be cases where we are not going to be able to walk by on the other side. She refers to humanitarian crises in the past such as in the Balkans and Rwanda. Ridge asks whether a Labour government would ever be prepared to use a nuclear deterrent. Griffith says the whole point of a deterrent is that you don\u2019t reveal what you would or wouldn\u2019t do. There must be \u201cthat element of doubt in your opponent\u2019s mind\u201d. Over to the BBC One for the Andrew Marr show now: Here\u2019s a clip of Kwasi Kwarteng on Sky News: Ian Blackford, the SNP leader in the House of Commons, was on after Kwarteng. Ridge asked what would be the red lines for the SNP in a hung parliament, when negotiating with other parties.. Blackford said austerity was important. Asked about Trident, he said the SNP had consistently opposed nuclear weapons but did not say it was a red line (as Nicola Sturgeon said in 2015). Climate change was also an important issue, said Blackford. Ridge shows Kwarteng Sky polling saying only 30% of voters think the Tories will spend more on public services. Their message that they are ending austerity is not getting through, she suggests. He responds by saying that Brexit is the central issue \u201cand then we can have a debate about spending\u201d. Ridge asks whether businesses in Northern Ireland will have to fill in forms after Brexit. Boris Johnson said no forms will be necessary but the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, said forms would be required in terms of trade from Northern Ireland to GB. Kwarteng says the PM is right but declines to say Barclay is wrong. Next Ridge asks about the abandoned pledge for an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party. Kwarteng says the government has a good record of tackling discrimination. He refers to Sajid Javid being in the cabinet. Asked about Lady Warsi\u2019s criticism of Matt Hancock for \u201cwhitesplaining\u201d, Karteng gives a general answer about all discrimination being unacceptable. Ridge asks Kwarteng about Boris Johnson\u2019s comparison of Jeremy Corbyn to Stalin, who is estimated to have killed 1 million people. Kwarteng defends the comparison as appropriate. He says \u201cthe philosophy, the underlying thinking\u201d is similar but there is no suggestion that Corbyn will line people up against a wall and kill anybody. Ridge asks how the Conservatives have gone through Labour\u2019s figures but not come up with their own. Kwarteng says opposition parties can \u201cpromise the earth\u201d without any analysis. Asked again about the figure for the Conservatives, he says: I\u2019m not going to bandy around figures. Ridge tells Kwarteng that\u2019s exactly what the Tories are doing with respect to Labour. Kwasi Karteng is asked by Sophy Ridge if the \u00a31.2tn figure (see previous update) is \u201cproject fear\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d, given Labour hasn\u2019t published its manifesto. The business minister says \u201cthey\u2019ve spoken about the four-day week\u201d as part of his justification. He says Labour\u2019s policies \u201cdon\u2019t add up\u201d. Ridge points out that not everything passed at conference becomes a policy. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that they are reckless in their spending,\u201d says Kwarteng. Ridge asks what the Tories\u2019s spending commitments will cost. Kwarteng says \u00a3150bn on infrastructure but won\u2019t give an answer to the overall figure. All he will say is that it is nowhere near Labour\u2019s figure. Good morning, welcome to Politics Live. It\u2019s a Sunday and it\u2019s just over a month until the general election so leading figures from the different parties will be desperately trying to make their case on the politics talk shows this morning. I\u2019ll be bringing you the action and keeping you updated all all the developments. If you want to get in touch/bring something to my attention your best bet is to tweet me @Haroon_Siddique. The Observer leads with the story that the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has delayed its announcement on whether Boris Johnson should face an investigation into possible criminal misconduct over allegations about a conflict of interest in his dealings while mayor of London with the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri until after the election. It says: The decision prompted fury from Westminster politicians and London assembly members who said it appeared that a ruling had been \u201csuppressed\u201d in order to protect Johnson from potentially damaging headlines at a crucial stage of the election campaign. The IOPC has denied the allegation that it has delayed the announcement claiming no decision has been made. First up out of the politics shows is Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News and she will be joined by the business minister Kwasi Kwarteng. He will no doubt want to put the emphasis on the Tories\u2019 claim that Labour\u2019s spending plans will cost the UK more than \u00a31tn over five years. The Sunday Telegraph, Sunday Times and Mail on Sunday all loyally splashed on the story. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, rubbished the dossier, which assumes all policies passed at the Labour conference are firm commitments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
