Solano, 26, was taken from his Benton home and questioned at Gosforth police station in the city. He was then released on bail. The matter now moves to the Crown Prosecution Service, which will decide whether it has a case on which to press charges. For the moment the club are standing by Solano. A United spokesman said last night: \"Newcastle United are aware that the police investigation is now under way in connection with the above matter. \"Nolberto Solano has cooperated fully with the investigation, giving a detailed explanation of his possession of the passport in question as the police continue their inquiries. Mr Solano is confident this will be accepted and ultimately he will be found to have done nothing improper.\" However, should it appear that Solano's situation is destined to become more serious, Newcastle, as Arsenal did with their Brazilian defender Silvinho, may try to offload the player, even though Solano now works and travels under his native Peruvian passport. In 1998 when Kenny Dalglish, then Newcastle manager, first sought to purchase the captain of Peru, there were problems over a work permit because of Solano's non-EU status. Somehow that problem was overcome when he was either given or came by a Greek passport. His European passport meant that the transfer from Boca, via a club in Lima, could proceed. A similar process seems to have been used in Silvinho's move from the Brazilian club Corinthians to Highbury. As Silvinho did not meet the work permit criteria - mainly based on a certain percentage of international appearances - he had to secure a European passport to enable the deal to go through. In Silvinho's case the passport he got was Portuguese but now that its legality is being investigated Arsenal's attempt to sell the player to Celta Vigo is not certain to happen. The Immigration Service also questioned the validity of two other passports used in transfers featuring Arsenal. The Lithuanian Tomas Danilevicius also had a Greek passport when he arrived at Highbury, and another Brazilian, Edu, had his move to Arsenal interrupted as the authenticity of his Portuguese passport was scrutinised. Newcastle United, meanwhile, have completed the loan signing of the French defender Sylvain Distin for the remainder of the season. The 23-year-old follows in the footsteps of the forward Laurent Robert, who also left Paris St-Germain to join the Premiership last month. Distin will not, however, be involved in tonight's Worthington Cup game against Brentford at St James' Park. Newcastle's manager Bobby Robson said: \"We are signing him on loan, which is really great for us because it means we'll have him all year and we can have a look at him. \"He's left-footed, which is one of the big reasons why I am signing him. He's a high-quality player. He's 6ft 4in and he's an Olympic sprinter. There were lots of clubs after him but he's chosen us.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
