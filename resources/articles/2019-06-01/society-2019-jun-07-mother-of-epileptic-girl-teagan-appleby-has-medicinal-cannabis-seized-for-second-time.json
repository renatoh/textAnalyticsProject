Emma Appleby was accompanied on her trip to the Netherlands by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, who has campaigned for greater access to medical cannabis. Although several cannabis-based medicines have been prescribed by the NHS since it was legalised in November, full extract cannabis oils \u2013 which campaigners say are both more effective and cheaper \u2013 remain unlicensed and do not appear to have been given to patients. However, they are available privately and a number of patients have gained access in that way. \u201cThere seems no end to the stress and trauma of trying to access the medical cannabis that I have proved beyond doubt transforms the life of my daughter Teagan,\u201d said Appleby, who was carrying a month\u2019s supply of medical cannabis oil worth about \u00a32,500. \u201cI am exhausted and shattered but I\u2019ve seen how this medicine transforms my daughter\u2019s life. I have to find a way forward. The NHS just won\u2019t prescribe. This is unforgivably cruel and unfair.\u201d After the first batch was seized by Border Force officials, Appleby and her partner Lee Moore obtained a prescription from a private consultant in the UK and had it returned days later. However, she was told she now needed an import licence which she said she could not afford. \u201cI am just a mum wanting to do the best for my child, not a company importing on a commercial basis.\u201d Within the medical community there is a reluctance to widen access to medical cannabis until further research is undertaken, while concern remains over the impact of THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis. There are fears that the use of medical cannabis is a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d for recreational cannabis legalisation, and the head of NHS England warned last month that medical cannabis use could \u201caccidentally normalise drug use\u201d. NHS England guidance provides narrow guidelines for the medicinal use of cannabis-based products, saying there must be \u201cclear published evidence of benefit\u201d and only used where all other treatment options have been exhausted. Antoniazzi criticised the implementation of the new laws on medicinal cannabis. \u201cEmma should not have to get a private prescription and have to cope with going abroad to get the medicine with all the bureaucracy this entails,\u201d she said. \u201cShe should be able to get it on the NHS. Emma has enough to do caring for her very sick daughter.\u201d Teagan has a rare chromosomal disorder called Isodicentric 15 as well as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a type of epilepsy which causes up to 300 seizures a day. Campaigners say that there are at least three other families who go abroad regularly to obtain medical cannabis, without revealing it upon their return to the UK. Home Office guidance states: \u201cIf you are... carrying less than three months\u2019 supply of prescribed controlled drugs listed under schedule 2... you will not need a personal import or export licence to enter or leave the UK.\u201d The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is set to issue revised guidance on the medicinal use of cannabis-based products later this year, after health secretary Matt Hancock called on the NHS to evaluate the barriers to \u201cclinically appropriate prescribing\u201d and encouraged greater research. A government spokesman said: \u201cIt is unlawful to import unlicensed cannabis-based products for medicinal use to the UK without a Home Office importation licence. \u201cThere is an established regulatory system which enables the importation of these products to the UK via pharmaceutical wholesalers, so they can be dispensed to UK resident patients prescribed these products by a specialist doctor.\u201d He added: \u201cBorder Force has a duty to enforce the law and stop the unlawful import of controlled substances into the UK.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
