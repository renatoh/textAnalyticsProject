A year after he arrived in 1997, he found his assistant shot dead in the steep alley beside the church. Then, just after Christmas, Sardinia's best-loved poet, Peppino Marotto, 82, was felled by six shots as he reached for the door handle of the newsagent's, inches from the church steps. At the packed funeral at which Casula officiated, rumours started that the poet had been killed by a local shepherd, Salvatore Mattana, after an argument. Now Mattana and his brother Egidio are dead after a country lane ambush, the 12-gauge shotgun wounds to their faces ruling out open-casket mourning, just the way vendetta killers like it. 'In 10 years, I have never really understood what drives vendettas, but it's not honour like in Sicily,' said Casula. 'Here it's pure hate, as if you'll do anything to stop the person who did you wrong existing.' It was not meant to be like this any more. Folded into craggy Sardinian hills a half-hour of hairpins away from the nearest big town, Orgosolo goes out of its way to welcome tourists who trek up from the beach resorts to see the town's famous murals, depicting struggles for social justice, from local battles with the Roman legions 2,000 years ago to Tiananmen Square. At the heart of Orgosolo's transformation from a hotbed of brigandry to a protest-art hub was Peppino Marotto, shepherd and bandit turned union organiser, poet and singer of shepherd songs inspired by the calls of animals and the sound of the wind. After spending part of the Fifties in jail on robbery charges - where he started writing poetry about peasant life - Marotto's fame grew as a peacemaker and he was helping out local people with their pension rights by the time the mystery killer emerged from the shadows of the church steps on 29 December. Early speculation that the poet died as the result of a 50-year-old vendetta quickly gave way to the rumours about Mattana. No witnesses came forward, but as Marotto once wrote of Orgosolo: 'You hear a voice in the countryside and you understand immediately. You see a light go on in the village and in that house you can imagine everything.' On 4 January, two killers fired up to 14 shots at the Mattana brothers, suggesting they gave themselves time to reload before fleeing. But for many, nothing made sense. 'No way was this the poet's family taking revenge - they are intellectuals,' said one local. 'And why would anyone else do it on their behalf? Vendettas don't work like that.' Peppino Marotto's daughter Lena refused to believe the brothers were guilty: 'These were our neighbours and we never rowed with them. I totally reject any link between these deaths and Peppino's and I hope the madness in the air clears,' she said. For mayor Francesco Meloni, the truth is possibly more contorted. 'There is a saying here that certain fish come out from under rocks only when the water gets murky. Someone could have taken advantage of this horrific rumour-mongering to settle their own score with the Mattanas, or may have even started the rumour deliberately,' he said. 'If the local police used their brains more and their machine guns less, this might not have happened.' The Mattanas were not short of enemies. Salvatore did jail time in 2001 for attempted murder, while his mother, sister and a third brother, Raffaele, escaped an ambush by unknown gunmen in 1994 when Raffaele managed to drive straight through an improvised roadblock under a hail of shotgun fire. By last Wednesday, the surviving Mattanas were huddled in the shuttered darkness of their council house, at the far end of a new street on the edge of town, waiting for church bells to tell them their kin had been released by police pathologists for burial. By the time the coffins arrived, a 120-strong group of local women clad in headscarves and ornately embroidered and tasselled black shawls had already packed into the cemetery chapel to recite a hypnotic rosary in Sardinian dialect without let-up for 30 minutes before the homily. Outside in the weak winter sun stood the men of Orgosolo, smoking in groups and staring across the valley to scraps of snow on the craggy hills. 'Return to God with all your heart, change your life and taste the joy of conversion and penitence,' said the priest, raising his voice to be heard by the killers probably lurking in the grieving crowd."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
