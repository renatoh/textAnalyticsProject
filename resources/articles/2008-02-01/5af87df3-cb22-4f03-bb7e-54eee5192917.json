Gates visited Baghdad to meet with General David Petraeus, the chief US commander in Iraq. Petraeus hinted recently that he favours a pause in troop movements once five brigades of troops finish coming home in July, but Gates has suggested that more could return by yearend. When Gates spoke to reporters today, he appeared to share Petraeus's perspective, endorsing \"a brief period of consolidation and evaluation\" after the first round of troop withdrawals is complete. If troop levels in Iraq remain at their planned summertime strength \u2014 an estimated 130,000 \u2014 George Bush would leave office with America's military presence in Baghdad as strong as it was before he announced his \"surge\" strategy in January 2007. Democrats in Congress, however, are gearing up to fight for troop withdrawals to continue past July. Petraeus is due to deliver public testimony on the war next month, giving Bush's critics a chance to re-energise the anti-war debate in Washington. \"I suspect that what we're seeing is part of an effort by the White House to kick the can down the road by maintaining the stay-the-course strategy through the end of the Bush presidency,\" Democratic senator Robert Menendez said in a statement following Gates's remarks. \"By refusing to change course, they will be passing off this war and its consequences for future generations of Americans to deal with and they will be undercutting our best chance for peace.\" Democrats may have private backing from several current and former Pentagon officials, including US army chief general George Casey, who have hinted in recent months that the military cannot sustain its current commitment in Iraq. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also took aim at Gates's remarks today, vowing to begin withdrawing more troops within 60 days if she is elected. \"I have said repeatedly that there is no military solution, and it's time for the American military to be relieved from the responsibility of refereeing the Iraqi civil war,\" Clinton said through her campaign office. \"It is clear that in the absence of a military solution, which I think [Gates's] announcement today obviously confirms, the Iraqi government will not take the steps that were expected and even demanded.\" Casey, who left Iraq early last year to make way for Petraeus, told the Wall Street Journal last month that Bush's surge \"has sucked all the flexibility out of the system\". Casey warned publicly last year that the army could not maintain its footing in Iraq indefinitely without serious consequences. Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, also plans to tell Congress this month that the Iraq war would prevent American troops from mobilising quickly in response to a second global crisis, should one occur. Mullen is calling the risk to US military readiness \"significant\", according to the Associated Press. Major General Mark Hertling, speaking on behalf of the Pentagon, defended Gates's remarks in his news conference today. Hertling described the situation as fluid, suggesting that the defence secretary is leaving his options open. \"[I]f you ask me today, on the 11th of February, what's going to happen [in] June or July as we continue to do off-ramping of units, it's the same as the question [of] how many [of the] enemy is out there,\" Hertling said. After Gates finished speaking in Baghdad, two suicide bomb explosions left eight dead and 23 wounded, the Washington Post reported."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
