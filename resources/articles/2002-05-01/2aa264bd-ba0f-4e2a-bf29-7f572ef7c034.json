My best day was at the start of this year when I represented Freeplay at the biggest consumer electronics show of the year in Las Vegas. As it is attended by all the major players in the electrical industry, it offered a real chance for Freeplay to demonstrate its wind-up technology . I was responsible for co-ordinating the nine Freeplay representatives who attended the show, sorting out travel arrangements, hotel and restaurant bookings - so it was important that I didn't mess up. The run-up to the show was hectic and it proved a massive learning curve, which at times, was daunting, but very exciting. Managing the Freeplay booth was my biggest challenge. I had to source all the branding and photography, ensure we had carpet, lighting, electrics and arrange shipping to the US so that the stand could be assembled in time for the show. I also took care of small, but vital, actions like ensuring we had sufficient sample products and that we all looked great in our corporate clothing. Watching it all unfold in such a professional manner, with all my colleagues confident in my work, was a fantastic feeling. My worst day began normally enough. I arrived early to prepare four Power Point presentations needed by colleagues rushing off to various parts of the globe to meet current and prospective partners. So, the pressure was on. And what happens when the pressure is on? Your computer crashes a thousand times, vital slides disappear from your presentation, there's no time to eat and drink and you begin to get more and more stressed! I had to give myself a stern talking to in order to calm down - and one by one I completed the presentations. It was then on to the focus group report looking at potential Freeplay products, which I co-wrote with my marketing director. I had never put anything like this together before, so not only was it a steep learning curve but it had to done within a very tight deadline and no room for mistakes. Finally, I produced a report looking at our products and projects under way in Africa. I translated the French questionnaires and added my comments to the report. And after a frantic, 12-hour day I was ready for a drink."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
