Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union began the action shortly after midnight on Tuesday as part of a five-day walkout. The strike is set to disrupt services for thousands of passengers in London, Berkshire, Surrey, Hampshire, Dorset, Devon, the Isle of Wight and Somerset. A reduced service is running across the network, although extra morning and evening trains were expected to run between London Waterloo and Reading to help ferry racegoers heading to Royal Ascot. In Surbiton, south-west London, passengers stood in a queue reportedly 300-metres-long stretching from the station to the high street on Tuesday morning. Passenger Adam Neal-Jones called the situation \u201cutter madness\u201d on Twitter and said the National Rail app had suggested trains were running on time. Alongside a video of the queue, Neal-Jones added: \u201cChaos today at Surbiton station, told to come back after 11 to possible [sic] get on a train.\u201d Another commuter on a train heading to Waterloo complained their ticket had cost the same despite the train being packed and with no announcements. Over the past two years, the long-running dispute has resulted in 29 days of industrial action. In February, a planned strike was halted after the RMT said \u201csubstantial progress\u201d had been made in talks with the rail operator. Across the SWR network, picket lines sprung up outside station while trains were cancelled or delayed and some were replaced with bus services. The company has said it will run extra trains to high-profile events including Royal Ascot \u2013 the opening day of which coincided with the beginning of the strike action. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said members had been left with no choice but to go ahead with the walkouts, and accused the company of dragging its heels during recent talks. \u201cFor more than three months we have sought to negotiate a conclusion to this dispute and it is wholly down to the management side that the core issue of the safety critical competencies and the role of the guard has not been signed off,\u201d he added. An SWR spokesman described the walkout as \u201cunnecessary\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing that despite having had dates in the diary for what we hoped would be further constructive talks, the RMT union decided to call disruptive strike action over the course of five days. \u201cThe RMT has always said it wanted us to keep the guard on every train which is what we have offered as part of a framework agreement.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
