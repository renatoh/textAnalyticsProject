Solzhenitsyn", "bodyText": "History and memory play tricks, and there are times when it is hard to remember that the Soviet Union, such a formidable part of our world for most of the 20th century, no longer exists. Vladimir Putin reminds some people of the KGB officer he once was, and there are regrettable whiffs of cold war posturing and authoritarianism coming from today's Kremlin. But it is an extraordinary reminder of just how much things have changed that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the onetime literary scourge of Stalinism and its successors, is enjoying popularity inconceivable when his great novel, The First Circle, was smuggled abroad to be published in 1968. The TV version of the book, set in a \"special prison\" for political detainees near Moscow, has been drawing record audiences and rave reviews for the past few days - outstripping an Arnold Schwarznegger movie on a rival channel. The fact that the mini-series has been broadcast on a state-run station is seen as evidence of greater openness towards the communist past. Solzhenitsyn, dubbed Russia's conscience, has lived reclusively since returning from exile in Vermont and has been criticised for his mystic nationalism. The author, now 87, has said it is impossible to imagine how bad things were in the old days. Still, his success on the small screen will be a salutary reminder. Perhaps similar exposure for a Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich and The Gulag Archipelago will help curb enthusiasm for Soviet-era nostalgia in today's Russia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
