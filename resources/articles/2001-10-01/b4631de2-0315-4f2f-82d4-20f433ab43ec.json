A leaflet from Tesco claimed the supermarket was committed to \"beating Boots on price\" and listed savings of up to 16% on toiletries products bought at the chemist. But Boots objected that the advertisement implied that all of Tesco's products were up to 16% cheaper than those in its stores. The advertising standards authority upheld the complaint, saying the leaflet was misleading. It has asked Tesco not to repeat it. The ruling could force Tesco to change the way it promotes the aggressive \u00a3100m price-cutting campaign it announced on September 17, when it pledged to cut 3,500 prices. The campaign has already run into controversy when it emerged that the supermarket had raised its prices in the weeks before it began the price-cutting drive. The ASA also upheld 47 complaints about a poster for Smirnoff vodka on the grounds that it was both offensive and likely to encourage excessive drinking. The advert depicted a naked man sliding down a curved bannister with the tagline \"If Smirnoff made pain killers\". Although the man's genitals were blurred, the complainants believed his penis was visible. The ASA said the poster was likely \"to cause serious or widespread offence\" and also that it \"depicted drunken activity and could encourage excessive drinking\". Guinness UDV, the owners of Smirnoff, was told not to use this approach again. But one ruling by the ASA is likely to bring a smile to the faces of women drivers - it upholds an ad from Diamond Car Insurance that states: \"Diamond only do car insurance for women because women are better drivers\". Two complainants did not believe that women were better drivers, but the ASA said Diamond's evidence proved women made fewer and smaller claims than men, bringing to a close an age-old debate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
