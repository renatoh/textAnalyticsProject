Repeatedly leave your car in the Aldi car park in Bournemouth. Alex Harris's flatmate faced such a bill after parking his car on the Aldi lot on four different occasions without using the store. There were notices in the car park warning of penalty charges for unauthorised parking, but until September they had never been enforced. Then Aldi began policing its car park. Last month Harris's father Robert received a demand for \u00a3170, the first of several, as a result of his son leaving his car (registered to Harris senior) in there. Let's get this straight. Anyone who ignores penalty warnings and parks in a private car park is taking a daft risk and deserves the fine. Robert Harris's objection is this: no tickets were placed on the offending vehicles when the fine was imposed, nearly three weeks elapsed before the fines arrived in the post, and then several fines relating to different periods arrived on the same day. Moreover, two of the penalty periods Harris was charged for overlapped by an hour. \"There is such a delay between the parking offence and the fine arriving that unwitting drivers find themselves receiving multiple penalty charge notices through the post,\" he says. \"Private parking companies should be required by law to fix tickets to offending cars and to send penalty charge notices on the day of enforcement. There should be a ceiling on charges.\" Private parking enforcement, however, is a free-for-all. Wheel-clampers are licensed and regulated by the Security Industry Authority, but the law takes no interest in penalty notices on private land. The DVLA can only recommend, not insist, that notices of the offence should be stuck to vehicles. The company responsible for Aldi's car park, Creative Car Park Management, says it can't slap notices on windscreens because it uses an automated system. Cars are photographed as they enter and leave the car park and the information downloaded on to a computer. \"We are aware of delays in the penalty notices reaching people,\" says a spokesman, who adds that those who receive several notices at once will be treated sympathetically. A not very special Royal Mail delivery Last month I reported the saga of the special delivery parcel that went astray. When the sender queried its whereabouts he was told the Royal Mail could not track items of post - the very service for which he had paid a premium. Now I hear from a postmistress, who requests anonymity, that Royal Mail can't even deliver its own stuff. \"We have to return out-of-date stock, such as stamps, to a central depot using special delivery if it's of value,\" she says. \"Items sent by my post office in July were still unaccounted for in October. It's hardly a recommendation to customers when the system loses its own material.\" When credit is due even without a bill Still on the subject of delayed demands for payment, what are your rights if you buy something on credit and don't get the bill? Christine Hodgson of London bought goods on a store card but didn't receive an invoice at the end of the month. When the next month's bill arrived it carried a late-payment charge which Hodgson refused to pay since, she argued, she hadn't been given the opportunity to settle up on time. \"I was told that it was my bad luck that the March bill had not arrived,\" she says, \"but it's surely the store's responsibility to send me the bill, not mine to estimate what it might be and pay accordingly.\" Sadly, Hodgson is wrong. It is the responsibility of the customer to settle up whether or not the bill arrives. If it doesn't turn up you should ring to chase it. Having said that, the store might have been more sympathetic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
