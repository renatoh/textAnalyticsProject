Sunday 23 June, 11pm, BBC Two Beecham House Has ITV finally filled that Downton-shaped hole in its schedules? On paper, this Delhi-set period drama may just be the series to take on Poldark. Yet its creator Gurinder Chadha (Bend It Like Beckham) has promised that Beecham House will be a \u201cflipping radical thing\u201d in its portrayal of Indian characters and unvarnished truths about empire and colonialism. Sunday 23 June, 9pm, ITV Revisionist History Malcolm Gladwell, truly one of podcasting\u2019s big beasts, is back with a new season of his show about misremembered moments from our past, with stories on Jesuits, mobsters and getting into law school. Meanwhile a spin-off series, Solvable, quizzes some of the world\u2019s most innovative thinkers.

Tuesday 25 June, 10pm, Sky1 Minding the Gap Director Bing Liu\u2019s debut made waves at Sundance last year for its touching portrayal of how three young men use skateboarding as an antidote to the cycle of toxic masculinity in the former steel-producing states of North America. Using lo-res footage from his youth combined with interviews of his subjects, Liu\u2019s film is intimate and moving.

Netflix thinks they do, so here it is, in which Jackson\u2019s punchy PI returns, bafflingly, to battle the evil forces of millennial progressiveness. Likely to be trash, but a freebie for Jackson completists. From Friday 28 June, Netflix The Witch A devout father (Ralph Ineson) rebels against puritan elders and leads his family to set up home beside a forbidding forest in 17th-century New England; the torment that follows in Robert Eggers\u2019s eerie little horror stems from the dysfunctional family\u2019s inner lives, centring on the pubescent daughter (Anya Taylor-Joy), in a tale that springs from the darkest folklore.
