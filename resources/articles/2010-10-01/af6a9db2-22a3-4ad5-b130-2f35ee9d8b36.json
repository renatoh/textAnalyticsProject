At speeds possible with rocket technology, a voyage to Gliese 581, in the constellation Libra, would take about 200,000 years. As a home away from a home, it won't work. But the planet now known as Gliese 581 g is a reminder of the extraordinary rewards of astronomy. Cosmological science begins with the Copernican principle that there is nothing special about the solar system. Four centuries after Copernicus, this principle permitted a chain of observation, experiment and deduction that within half a human lifetime confirmed that the universe began with a big bang 13.7bn years ago. Robotic missions to Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn showed that if life could begin on Earth, then it could surely happen on any planet of a similar fabric and mass, orbiting a similar star in a zone not too hot and not too cold for liquid water. Giant telescopes counted the stars: 100bn or more in this galaxy, one of 100bn galaxies. But the solar system appeared to be alone of its kind. The first extra-solar planet \u2013 or exoplanet \u2013 was identified in 1995: a kind of hot Jupiter, circling close to the star 51 Pegasi 50 light years away. Since then, astronomers have found 490 exoplanets but \"seen\" none of them. A planet is a ball of gas and dust dancing in a star's gravitational embrace. Gravity is a two-way thing and 51 Pegasi b was spotted from flickers of movement in the star that could only be explained by an invisible mass in orbit around it. Since then, researchers have confirmed the existence of exoplanets from rhythmic changes in starlight as an orbiting object moves across the face of the star, but that, too, is hardly a direct sighting. It took 11 years of observation and analysis to demonstrate that at least six planets orbit Gliese 581, and that one of them is a terrestrial-type planet in the so-called Goldilocks zone. Last year a purpose-built planet-spotter began the search for Earth-like planets as they transit across the faces of their parent stars. If there are other habitable planets, could they be inhabited? And if they are not inhabited, then could there be something very special indeed about Earth, and its citizens? The Gliese 581 team say: \"If the local stellar neighbourhood is a representative sample of the galaxy as a whole, our Milky Way could be teeming with potentially habitable planets.\" The next step is to devise instruments that can take a closer look, perhaps for distant planetary atmospheres that contain oxygen and methane, the telltale signature of life as we know it. Our Earth-like neighbour 20 light years away is not the climax of a search. It is just a beginning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
