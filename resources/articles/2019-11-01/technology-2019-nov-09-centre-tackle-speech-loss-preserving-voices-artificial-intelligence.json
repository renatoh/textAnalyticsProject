Researchers say the venture \u2013 a joint effort between Northeastern University in Boston and the company VocaliD \u2013 could play an important role in maintaining a sense of identity among those with conditions ranging from throat cancer to motor neurone disease, by offering them the chance to sound like themselves even after self-generated speech has become impossible. Thought to be the first of its kind, the centre\u2019s lead researcher is Prof Rupal Patel, the founder and chief executive of VocaliD. While Patel said the company already offered individuals the option to record their voices in their own homes, in reality, many people either lack equipment for high-quality recordings or make recordings with background noise. Patel said there was also a need to offer greater support to those who require such services and make sure patients were aware they were available in plenty of time. \u201cOftentimes, they\u2019ll come to us at the last minute,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have enough time to bank their voice and they are also just so enveloped in their disease and then the surgery \u2013 that is very stressful.\u201d As a result, the company has teamed up with Northeastern \u2013 where Patel is currently on leave as a faculty member \u2013 to bring the technology to the community. The upshot is the Voice Preservation Clinic, a centre where people, typically those at risk of losing their voices, can record themselves as part of a \u201clegacy\u201d project. The approach is far more sophisticated than chopping up words and then stringing them together, instead making use of machine-learning algorithms \u2013 a type of artificial intelligence. The first step is to \u201cbank\u201d the voice, with participants offered poems, short stories or speeches from a range of topics, which they record in a special booth. \u201cWhat we have them do is record about two to three hours of speech. From those recordings, we then are able to build an AI-generated voice engine, essentially, that sounds like them,\u201d said Patel. Effectively, it can say words, in the user\u2019s voice, that were never recorded. When the digital voice is installed on the accompanying app, whether on a phone or special device, a user can type what they want to say and the audio will produce the sentences in the user\u2019s voice. \u201cWith the cancer population, they have control of their hands, and they can communicate \u2013 but they want to communicate as themselves,\u201d Patel said. The legacy project, she added, is different to the company\u2019s other service, in which people can donate recordings of themselves speaking to help build a \u201cbespoke\u201d voice for those who are already unable to speak. The technology, said Patel, is improving rapidly \u2013 voices are sounding more and more like human speech and, while there is still some way to go on changing the intonation of the voice, the team has started developing filters to offer users more choice when it comes to how phrases are expressed. Patel said the team could also age an individual\u2019s voice so it grows with them, but only up to a point. It is not yet possible to turn a child\u2019s voice into that of a teenager or an adult, although the team can turn it into the voice of an older child. While the recording service is free, it will cost $1,499 (\u00a31,360) to have a voice built. However, the clinic said it would not charge customers during its first year. Patel said anyone can come and bank their voice, but priority will be given to those who are expecting to lose their ability to speak."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
