Would you be prepared to swap a big City salary for something a little more relaxed? Or do you just want to get away from the daily grind of academia? If so, Gordon Brown is looking for someone just like you. The chancellor, you see, appears to be having enormous trouble finding anybody to fill vacancies on the monetary policy committee at the Bank of England. Which is a bit strange, since membership of the club will make you one of the most powerful people in the land. What's more, you don't need to do much. The family-friendly employment policy means you only have to work a three-day week, and all you are really required to do is to turn up once a month, listen sagely as the Bank's brainy economists explain that some indicators suggest growth is strengthening, while others suggest it is weakening, and then - having taken all the evidence into consideration - you leave interest rates unchanged. And, at the end of the year, you'll find you're nigh-on \u00a3100k better off. So get the CV tarted up now, and send it off to the Treasury. I joke, of course. The august members of the MPC deliberate just as carefully in months when they leave borrowing costs unchanged as they do in months when they move them. It just so happens that the committee has concluded, in every month since last August, that the best way of meeting the government's 2% inflation target is to leave interest rates where they are, at 4.5%. Some economists believe that this period of inactivity may last for the rest of the year, which would be the longest period of unchanged rates since the MPC was set up in May 1997. There is an obvious contrast here with the US Federal Reserve, which cut rates far more aggressively in the downturn earlier in the decade and - after leaving them at 1% for a considerable period - has raised them by 0.25 percentage points at each of its last 17 meetings. The Bank's rather more sedate approach, however, appears to have paid off. Despite a thumping increase in the oil price, inflation is on target. What's more, the economy's quarterly growth rate of 0.6% is bang in line with its long-term trend, as well. So, let's hear it for the Bank. Trebles all round, as Private Eye would say. There are a number of explanations for the MPC's masterly inactivity. The most upbeat - and the one favoured by the chancellor - is that the stability of interest rates reflects the stability of the economy. Another, less benign, is that there is so much \"noise\" in the economic data at present, that the most sensible course is to do nothing, rather than zigzag around. A third would be that the good and the bad bits of news broadly cancel each other out, resulting in steady growth and low inflation. This explanation is not universally accepted. There are - and always have been - experts (sometimes even within the MPC itself) who have noted that the apparent equilibrium of the economy as a whole, has masked serious imbalances between its component parts. In particular, there has been prolonged debate about the disparity between the strength of the UK's service sector under Labour and the dismal performance of manufacturing. Two papers in the June edition of the Economic Journal address this very issue. The first, by David Cobham, notes that one reason for the imbalances between the tradable sector (the bit that exports) and the non-tradable sector (the bit that sells in the UK) has been the persistent over-valuation of sterling brought about by a 20% appreciation in the currency in the second half of 1996 and the first half of 1997. Credibility During the first part of this period, Kenneth Clarke deliberately sought to put the brake on the pound's rise by rejecting, month after month, the advice of the Bank that rates needed to rise to head off growing inflationary pressure. Mr Brown's decision to grant the Bank operational independence enhanced the credibility of monetary policy in the financial markets, giving a further upward twist to the pound, and sterling continued to rise when the newly formed MPC raised interest rates at its first three meetings. A rising exchange rate does two things. It makes exports dearer and imports cheaper. As a result, you would expect those parts of the economy that rely more heavily on overseas customers - manufacturing - to perform less well than those that rely on the domestic market. That has been precisely what has happened under Labour. Between 1996 and 2004, the economy grew by a robust 2.7% a year on average, but manufacturing output rose by only 0.3% a year. By contrast, the service sector grew by 3.6% a year. Unsurprisingly, the UK's visible trade gap has grown steadily worse. The Bank was confident that the strength of sterling would be temporary. Its models pointed to the exchange rate coming down and, therefore, the cost of imports going up. But it was wrong. The pound stayed high, imports remained cheap, and inflation persistently undershot the government's target. Not by much, but by enough to suggest that the MPC kept rates higher than they need have been. Sushil Wadhwani questioned the Bank's approach to the exchange rate during his three-year spell on the MPC. Some modifications to the way the Bank modelled movements in sterling were made, but there were no policy moves that sought to bring down the level of the pound. The arguments used to justify this were that the Bank did not want to confuse the markets by suggesting it now had an exchange rate, as well as an inflation target; that the strength of domestic demand cautioned against cheaper borrowing; and that there was a great deal of uncertainty about how the pound would move if the MPC did act. Mr Cobham finds the last of these reasons unsatisfactory, arguing there is a case for a re-examination of the monetary framework itself, \"including the possibility of adopting the euro\". The second Economic Journal paper argues that any change should be a shift from an inflation target based on consumer prices to one based on domestic output prices. Tatiana Kirsanova, Campbell Leith and Simon Wren-Lewis say this would be a better measure of inflation because the CPI is influenced by the price of imports, which, in turn, are affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate. It is an idea well worth considering. There have been signs that manufacturing output is picking up, but that is mainly the result of strong global growth. Anything that can prevent further damage to the UK's industrial base from an over-valued exchange rate should be looked at carefully, and now is the perfect time. It might even give the Bank something to do. larry.elliott@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
