Michael Brown, 39, who invested trillions of investors' cash through a private equity firm, 5th Avenue Partners, gave more than half the \u00a34.1m that was donated to the party in the three-month \"phoney war\" before Tony Blair called the election. The donation was hailed by the party yesterday as the first of many from wealthy donors which, they hoped, would \"level the playing field\". Mr Brown was not available for comment in Majorca yesterday. The money helped fund the party's most ambitious general election campaign, which included heavy advertising in newspapers, and an extensive poster campaign in key marginal constituencies. The Liberal Democrats also got \u00a3290,000 from the City fund managers Carrousel Capital, \u00a3250,000 from the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, and \u00a310,000 from the former BBC director general Greg Dyke. Nonetheless during the run-up to the campaign, Electoral Commission data showed, Labour got \u00a39.1m, the largest amount in donations, and the Tories got \u00a38m. Labour's donations were mainly from trade unions but included \u00a32m from Lord Sainsbury, and \u00a3250,000 from Nigel Doughty, chairman of Nottingham Forest football club. Other donations included \u00a3250,000 from the City tycoon William Bollinger, and \u00a3200,000 from the Europhile financier Derek Tullett. The Tories' donations were mainly aimed at constituencies. They got \u00a31m from Joseph C Bamford, and \u00a3350,000 from Intercapital. Over six months before the election the Tories allotted \u00a348,000 to defend the leadership contender David Davis, \u00a340,000 to help win the Labour marginal of Welwyn-Hatfield, and \u00a390,000 to defend the Tory marginal seat of Surrey, South West."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
