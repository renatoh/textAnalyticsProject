That was the suggestion of Cesc F\u00e1bregas in the wake of Wednesday's 1-1 draw with Liverpool in the home leg of their Champions League quarter-final. The game had been marked by a significant percentage of the home fans loudly criticising their own players for perceived errors in passing, control and finishing, or demanding personnel changes from Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. The limited vocal support contrasted sharply with that coming from the away section. Talking to Spanish television station Antena 3, F\u00e1bregas drew a contrast between the two supports. 'It is incredible the passion with which Liverpool fans live their games,' he said. 'Even the smallest cup game has a great atmosphere there, it is as if they played with 12 men. 'Let's see what happens [in Tuesday's return leg]. The good thing about playing away is that we don't have the pressure from our fans. Sometimes you don't get one or two passes right and...' The value of Liverpool's support was a common theme among the participants last week. 'For me, the atmosphere there is the best in the world, it's unbelievable how the team and the crowd act in the same way together,' said the Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia. 'I think our supporters could help pull us through,' argued the Liverpool left-back F\u00e1bio Aur\u00e9lio, while his manager laid the ground for a continuation of the tactics that delivered away-leg success. Rafa Ben\u00edtez's side are at their best when frustrating more talented sides, then picking them off in moments of over-commitment. He is keen for Anfield to back patiently a repeat of such methods. 'The fans must be key for us,' Ben\u00edtez said. 'In terms of pushing the team and also to understand how we play.' It is a style that has regularly frustrated Arsenal this season. The groundwork laid by Sir Alex Ferguson in a 2-2 Premier League draw in November was built upon by Tottenham's Juande Ramos in three carefully plotted encounters culminating in January's 5-1 League Cup semi-final annihilation. Since then Aston Villa, Birmingham City and Middlesbrough have successfully adopted the strategy of dense eight-man defending coupled with rapid counter-attacks. Ben\u00edtez admitted to taking notes. 'We were watching them. Two or three things you can learn from the other teams, but at the end of the day, it depends on your players. You can learn how they play with [Cristiano] Ronaldo or [Dimitar] Berbatov, but after you will have [Steven] Gerrard and [Fernando] Torres so you need to use your players. 'Arsenal have a style that everybody knows. They can have plenty of possession, they can play long with F\u00e1bregas, they can play in between with [Robin] van Persie or [Alexander] Hleb. So we knew we needed to work hard. 'We knew they would have possession, so we needed to control, regain and play counterattack. Sometimes if you don't have the pace or ability they have in some players, you have other qualities you need to use - the pace of Torres, the quality of Gerrard and the rest of the team needs to work hard.' Aur\u00e9lio, who nullified the threat of Emmanuel Eboue and Theo Walcott in London, expanded on the group defending required to frustrate Arsenal's passing. 'When you play teams like that it's very difficult to mark them because they move the ball very quickly,' said the Brazilian. 'So what you have to do is to close the gaps between your lines. That's what we look for - being really compact and organised so they don't have any spare space.' It is in neither Wenger nor Arsenal's make-up to adapt their style to the opposition, preferring to hold to their 'beliefs' and trust in their football to prevail. On this, F\u00e1bregas toed the party line. 'I think it's going to be very difficult because they defend very well. Even more now with 1-1, I think all they'll want to do is catch us on the break. 'We want to attack. Just because the other team refuse to play we don't have to do the same. We want to stick to our football - that's what we'll do, even if we lose.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
