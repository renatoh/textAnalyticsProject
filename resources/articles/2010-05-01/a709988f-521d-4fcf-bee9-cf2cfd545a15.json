That should have been \u00a35,000 a week (Lord's expensive exit? 18 May, page 2, Sport). \u2022 Scrutinising a recent allegation by a British actor, Charlotte Lewis, that as a teenager she was assaulted by the film director Roman Polanski, a comment piece pointed to positive remarks made by her in published reports some years ago about her relationship with the director. The commentary was incorrect, however, in saying that one such report \u2013 a 1999 News of the World interview with Charlotte Lewis \u2013 got no mention in a Mail on Sunday feature on 16 May about the new assault allegation. In fact the newspaper and web versions of the MoS piece did quote from the 1999 interview, though without naming the paper where it appeared (A media lynch mob is bent on destroying Polanski, 19 May, page 28). \u2022 With an article about allegations that the likes of Google and Facebook are infringing user privacy, a graphic depicted policy revisions at Facebook that have made previously private information on users publicly viewable by default.
