But was it real?", "bodyText": "The internet is abuzz with talk of ladybugs. On Tuesday, the San Diego office of the National Weather Service tweeted that it had picked up an odd radar echo that evening. It looked like a bit of rain, the meteorologist Alex Tardy, who works at the San Diego office, told the Guardian. \u201cBut then we realized \u2013 it\u2019s not raining,\u201d Tardy said. The team spoke with volunteer weather spotters in the area, and one of them noticed \u201ca lot of ladybugs around\u201d. Based on that information, the office sent out a memorable tweet. The post was retweeted more than a thousand times, and both local and national news outlets caught on. And since then, Tardy says, he and other meteorologists in the office have been working to confirm the theory \u2013 with little luck. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not birds, and it\u2019s not bats. But we\u2019re still not sure if it\u2019s ladybugs,\u201d Tardy said. The radar was picking up on \u201clots of tiny things, about the size of large raindrops\u201d, he noted. Those could have been bugs, or possibly chaff \u2013 bits of aluminum or other materials that the military disperses in the air in order to confuse and overwhelm aircraft-detecting radars. The Guardian has contacted the nearby Edwards air force base and Twentynine Palms Marine Corps air ground combat center, but neither immediately responded to requests for comment. \u201cBecause this was at night, the visibility would have been low,\u201d Tardy noted. \u201cAnd whatever we caught on the radar was pretty high up \u2013 more than 5,000ft in the air,\u201d impossible to capture with cameras or cellphones from the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad there wasn\u2019t anyone in a private plane up in the air at that time,\u201d said Lynn Kimsey, an entomologist at the University of California, Davis. \u201cWe could\u2019ve figured it out based on which dead insects were splatted across the wings,\u201d added Kimsey, who has worked with Nasa and Boeing in the past to do just that. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me that it was ladybugs, although it seems a bit late in the season,\u201d she said. The bright red insects are known to hibernate in clusters along California\u2019s foothills and migrate west in the springtime. Mobilized by warm weather, a huge group of bugs might have taken flight together or gotten swept up with the wind, she said. But other experts noted that it was highly unusual for thousands or millions of ladybugs in California to migrate all at once. \u201cThey tend to move gradually rather than in huge clusters,\u201d said Steve Heydon, a curator of the Bohart Museum of Entomology in Davis. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re caribou or something.\u201d Moreover, a cool evening doesn\u2019t present the optimal conditions for ladybugs to take flight, he noted. Ladybugs tend to be active at temperatures of about 60F (15.5C) or higher. Weather balloons that night estimated temperatures lower than that, according to Tardy. It\u2019s \u201cnot impossible that a swarm could be caught in a wind stream\u201d, said the Cornell University entomologist John Losey in an email. \u201cA swarm this large has never been observed on radar before as far as I am aware,\u201d though huge swarms have washed up along coasts in Egypt, the UK and the United States, he said. Generally, swarms in the air are hard to see with the naked eye and have rarely been observed. And so, Losey said, \u201cwe may never know exactly what caused these radar patterns\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
