The index of blue-chip British companies fell as much as 100 points during the day, but gains on Wall Street provided support for European markets. After spending much of the day below 5,000, the FTSE-100 closed at 5,033, for a loss of 36 points. Bourses in France and Germany also pared back early losses to end just below opening prices. Tokyo, however, closed with heavy losses to hit a 17-year low. In lunchtime trading, the Dow was Jones industrial average was up 36 points at 9.660. Energy stocks, including Scottish Power, were among the big losers on the London stock exchange, amid weakness in crude oil prices. At the lows, some \u00a340bn was wiped off the value of the FTSE-100 as the market suffered its worst battering since the emerging markets crisis of late 1998. This weekend, the US treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, sought to restore calm on world markets by saying that the US economy will soon show signs of recovery after markets took fright last Friday. Traders on Wall Street dumped shares in response to dismal US jobless figures, sending the Dow Jones industrial average plunging by 235 points. Today, there were hints that the Federal Reserve would again cut rates as American economic prospects deteriorate. Anthony Santomero, the president of the Philadelphia federal reserve bank, said the Fed should be able to cut short-term interest rates between formally scheduled meetings \"when appropriate\", although such inter-meeting cuts should be \"irregular\". The Fed has already cut rates seven times this year and is due to meet again next month. Today's comments suggest that the American central bank might not wait till then to act. Asked if he favoured inter-meeting rate cuts, Mr Santomero replied: \"We can't preclude taking action when appropriate.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
