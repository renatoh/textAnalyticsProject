Sampson responded by claiming the former Marseille player was \u201cwet behind the ears when it comes to tournament football\u201d before reminding everyone that his win ratio is much better than Echouafni\u2019s. England have not beaten Les Bleues since 1974 but they won all their Group D fixtures here, topping the section, whereas Echouafni\u2019s players recorded only one victory, finishing second in Group C. \u201cHe\u2019ll learn who to talk about and who not to,\u201d said Sampson. \u201cWe are an experienced team and I\u2019m an experienced manager. But luckily for them the game is not played in the press room. It\u2019s a great challenge for us to face France but we want to win this tournament \u2013 and win it the right way, by beating the best teams.\u201d France are ranked third in the world behind the United States and Germany, with England fifth and Canada fourth. At 44, Echouafni is 10 years Sampson\u2019s senior and had brief stints in charge of the men\u2019s teams at Amiens and Sochaux before taking over France women. He hopes to do well enough in the Netherlands to earn a contract to remain in charge when his country hosts the 2019 World Cup. Les Bleues most recently beat England 2-1 at the SheBelieves Cup in the United States in March but have struggled to impose themselves during Euro 2017 and came close to a shock elimination. The Lionesses\u2019 cause will be aided by the absence of the suspended Wendie Renard, widely hyped as the world\u2019s best defender. \u201cWe have three wins under our belt at the Euros, while France have one win,\u201d said Sampson. \u201cWe feel confident for these high-pressure games. We\u2019ve got a two-day turnaround and they\u2019ve got three days but we\u2019ll be ready for them.\u201d Considering France have defeated England in each of the past three major tournaments history is hardly on his side but Sampson remains undeterred. \u201cThere are some great teams in this tournament and we are certainly one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a good spot.\u201d Amandine Henry, Echouafni\u2019s influential midfielder, has further inflamed tensions by claiming France \u201care better technically than England\u201d but Jodie Taylor is not perturbed. \u201cThey\u2019re fantastic technicians but we\u2019re technically great as well,\u201d said Sampson\u2019s leading scorer. \u201cAnd we\u2019re also tactically great, we\u2019re physically great and we\u2019re mentally strong. \u201cIt\u2019s a great time to play France; they\u2019re missing Renard, she\u2019s a fantastic defender, one of the best players in the world. You can\u2019t underestimate France but we\u2019re right up there with them \u2013 if they underestimate us, then great.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
