But the battle over King\u2019s legacy threatened to turn into a \u201cbusiness issue\u201d in an Atlanta courtroom Tuesday, where a judge heard arguments in a case pitting the civil rights leader\u2019s two sons against his sole surviving daughter. At stake was the fate of two King artifacts too significant to be called memorabilia: the Bible he traveled with as a young man, and the Nobel Peace Prize he was awarded in 1964. King\u2019s sons, Martin Luther King III and Dexter Scott King, had asked the court to force their sister, Bernice King, to turn the objects over to the King estate they control, for possible sale. Fulton County superior court judge Robert McBurney declined to rule in the case Tuesday, saying he hoped to do so before a trial date scheduled for February, when the longstanding episode in a family drama over the King estate could finally come to a close. Dexter King declined to tell reporters outside the court Tuesday whether the objects would be put up for sale if the brothers win the case. \u201cThis is a business issue, and it\u2019s certainly my hope that we can resolve it ultimately in some type of form that precludes having to go to trial,\u201d he told the Charlotte Observer. \u201cBut if we can\u2019t, that\u2019s why courts are here.\u201d The medal and Bible currently are being held by the court. Lawyers for Bernice King argued at the hearing that the objects were more important to the King legacy than previously sold objects and documents. The episode laid bare yet again tensions among the siblings, who have disagreed in court for years about the management of the King legacy. Last year Bernice King said in a court statement that her father \u201cMUST be turning in his grave\u201d at the latest proposed sale. \u201cWhile I love my brothers dearly, this latest decision by them is extremely troubling,\u201d Bernice King said. \u201cNot only am I appalled and utterly ashamed, I am frankly disappointed that they would even entertain the thought of selling these precious items. It reveals a desperation beyond comprehension.\u201d The brothers have argued that the estate, in which Bernice has a one-third voting share, needs money for its educational mission and to maintain King\u2019s legacy. The King estate has a history of asserting ownership in court of the civil rights icon\u2019s most famous works and words. In 1999, the family fought CBS News over unpaid royalties for the network airing King\u2019s \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech. In 2008, the estate criticized Harry Belafonte, the singer and friend of King, for plans to auction King documents. Belafonte won a lawsuit against the estate to retain possession of the documents. According to appraisers interviewed by the Associated Press, the Nobel medal could sell for $5-$10m or more and the Bible could bring anywhere from $200,000 to $1m. A sale of King documents by the family in 2006 brought $32m. King\u2019s wife, Coretta Scott King, died in 2006 and King\u2019s first daughter, Yolanda King, died in 2007. The media arm of the Nobel Prize tweeted about the dispute on Tuesday, but did not return a call and email seeking comment on the case. President Barack Obama swore on the King Bible for his second inauguration, which fell on Martin Luther King Jr Day in 2013, the 50th anniversary of the \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech. The Bible is a King James. King\u2019s Nobel acceptance speech extolled the principle of nonviolence. \u201cAfter contemplation, I conclude that this award which I receive on behalf of that movement is a profound recognition that nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral question of our time \u2013 the need for man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to violence and oppression,\u201d King said. \u201cCivilization and violence are antithetical concepts.\u201d Born in Atlanta in 1929, King earned a divinity degree and became a pastor in Alabama at age 25. He preached at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta and was a founder of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a consortium of southern black churches that was a key organizing force behind the 1963 March on Washington, the Selma voting rights movement and other watershed moments of the civil rights era. King was assassinated in Memphis on 4 April, 1968. King\u2019s birthday is Thursday. Martin Luther King Jr Day is this coming Monday. Selma is considered a Best Picture lock when the Academy Award nominations are released on Thursday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
