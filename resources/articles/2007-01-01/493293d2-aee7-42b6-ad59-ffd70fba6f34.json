David Cameron said yesterday: \"We must show that unlike Labour, we will be a party that is for working people, not rich and powerful vested interests.\" He has also asked shadow home secretary David Davis to head a new Conservative taskforce to look at ways of ending the slowdown in social mobility that has occured under the Labour government. The move, part of an attempt to show the Tories are no longer simply the mouthpiece of big business also follows the recent Tory assertion that relative and not just absolute poverty must be cut. Mr Davis's taskforce, appointed by Mr Cameron, will be separate from the work being undertaken by the social justice policy commission headed by Iain Duncan-Smith. It underlines the extent to which Mr Cameron is going to face a formidable challenge next year in marrying the conflicting polices likely to emerge from his various working groups in the autumn. Mr Davis has been chosen to lead the taskforce partly since he himself symbolises the value of meritocracy. He was raised on a council estate and went to a comprehensive school before developing a successful business career."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
