It is the second time Obrist has been named the most powerful figure in the global art world for his work, not just at the Serpentine but also as an art critic, curator, author and sought-after panellist. Oliver Basciano, deputy editor of ArtReview, said the 20-person panel had selected Obrist once again because of \u201chis energy and the fact that he connects so many people; he\u2019s everywhere\u201d. Obrist first topped the Power100 in 2009 but Basciano said his influence had continued to grow since then. The 48-year-old began his career by obsessively seeing exhibitions all around Europe, meeting and collecting artists and curators, something he did until 1991, when he hosted his first show in the kitchen of his student flat. He continued hosting shows in unusual locations, gaining notoriety on the art circuit, and in 1995, curated his first at the Serpentine, the now notorious Take Me (I\u2019m Yours), in which people were asked to take home something from the exhibition. He became director of the Serpentine in 2006 and has become famous for his refusal to conform to normal sleeping patterns, working almost every hour of the day and travelling the world constantly to exhibitions, arts fairs and conferences. Obrist\u2019s evolving DIY art show Do It has been going strong since 1991 and this year will visit 50 locations including New Jersey and Croatia. \u201cI think something that runs through this list is that the power lies in ideas circulating rather than objects,\u201d said Basciano. \u201cHans Ulrich\u2019s ideas pass through the art world as well as through instagram and social media. He\u2019s quoted everywhere, he knows everyone and he has this vast network \u2013 his thoughts are going places that one single artist\u2019s work could never hope to end up.\u201d Also in the Top 10 is Polish curator Adam Szymczyk, who will be the artistic director of Documenta in 2017, the influential contemporary art show in Kassel, Germany, that only happens once every five years. Outgoing director of the Tate, Nicholas Serota, is tied at fifth place this year with Frances Morris who became director of the Tate Modern in January. As well as gallerists and directors, the Power 100 list includes several influential artists. An acclaimed Berlin-based video artist, Hito Steyerl, was the highest-ranking artist in the list this year, which Basciano said was a tribute to her work, her ideas and writings on subjects such as mass media and technology. \u201cHer work goes from video to writing to theory, and these ideas can travel faster than objects,\u201d he said. \u201cHer ideas are quoted all over the world and her theories have had quite an intense impact on art production, so she transcends her own work in some way.\u201d Other artists in the Top 10 were Wolfgang Tillmans and Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei. The newest, and also youngest, artist on the list was the British digital and video artist Ed Atkins, at No 50. Basciano said Atkins was included this year for his \u201csheer unbiquity \u2026 Ed Atkins he\u2019s been canonised by the European and American galleries and there are so many people supporting that \u2026 in 50 years\u2019 time people will still be referring to his work. There\u2019s almost an assured longevity there.\u201d The American feminist cultural theorist Donna Haraway also made her debut in the Power 100, a nod to how influential her ideas around feminism, technology and the breaking down of boundaries between gender identity have become over the past year. Similarly, the continuing rise of art as a powerful type of social activism was reflected in the inclusion of artists such as Theaster Gates, South African artist Zanele Muholi and Rick Lowe, who works with the social fabric of places in his art. Basciano said that in post-Brexit Britain, the international spread and influence of the figures in the Power 100 were proof of how resilient the art world still was in defying national borders and would continue to be so in the future. \u201cHans Ulrich personifies that globalist outlook but so does Wolfgang Tillmans, whose work \u2013 not just to mention his anti-Brexit posters \u2013 very much is a documentation of that liberal internationalism,\u201d he said. \u201cContemporary art is, in its very DNA, internationalist and that\u2019s not going to change.\u201d The 2016 Power100 Top 10 Hans Ulrich Obrist Adam Szymczyk Iwan &amp; Manuela Wirth David Zwirner Nicholas Serota &amp; Frances Morris Larry Gagosian Hito Steyerl Adam D.
