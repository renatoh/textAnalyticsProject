Devised by the British Horseracing Authority and signed by everyone, from the racecourses and breeders to trainers, jockeys and stable staff, it seemed to show the sport's factions standing shoulder-to-shoulder for once, in the fight for a \u00a350m-plus boost to the levy on bookmakers' profits. A personal view, however, is that, while the charter and its two-page covering letter certainly represent an achievement, it is not the one that the instigators had in mind. Instead, in just three sides of A4, it manages to summarise everything that is wrong with the structure, administration and outlook of British racing. They want more money. Dammit, they deserve more money. They had it a couple of years ago and now they want it back. But they don't want to earn it \u2013 that would be tawdry. They just want to count it and bank it. This is racing united only in arrogance, complacency and sheer pig-headedness. Oh, and futility too, because it does not matter how many times you suggest that the \"right target range\" for the levy is between \u00a3130m and \u00a3150m, rather than the current estimate for 2010 of \u00a375m. The government will still laugh at you. This is not, of course, how those who signed the Racing United charter would see it. They all believe quite sincerely that they have the best interests of British racing at heart. But the same argument has now been rehearsed so many times that the words and numbers seem to appear without anyone stopping to think. The levy system itself is often seen as the problem but it is really just another symptom. The ultimate fault lies with racing's power structure, which predates the Reform Act of 1832 by a good half-century and has yet to adapt to modern, commercial realities. Trainers, for instance, are frequently described as \"stakeholders\" in the sport. They are not stakeholders. They are employees. The same goes for jockeys and, to an extent, for breeders too. Owners, trainers and jockeys come and go. The major racecourses do not and this is where the real power would lie in a modern racing industry. Owners would not be \"stakeholders\" either, but one of the tracks' two main customer groups, along with punters (both pay-at-the-gate and via the bookmakers). Those same punters, perhaps the most important customers of all in the long term, were treated as an irrelevance by the Racing United charter. The Jockey Club was founded by owners and they have always wielded great power in the sport as a result. And the Club has huge influence among racecourses too, since it owns so many of the major venues via Jockey Club Racecourses. This could yet be an advantage, if it can be established that the subsidiary has become more important than the parent company. And with the main media rights deals up for renewal in 2013, the government surely sick of the levy system and the BHA still turning out the same, tired rhetoric, now would be a very good time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
