Launched a week ago and airing on Sunday evenings, it's the first radio programme aimed at the travelling community. \"Rokker\" means \"talk\" in Romany, and the talk is led in lively fashion by presenter Jake Bowers, a journalist with a Gypsy background. \"We were a voiceless community until five minutes ago,\" he said at the beginning of the first show, sounding mighty proud. As well he might, for this is tremendous radio: impassioned and educative, campaigning and entertaining. It touches on issues you might expect, such as battles with councils, but it also covers subjects such as ageing and tracing Romany relatives. Bowers has a strong sense of connection with callers to the show (\"I know your site, mate\" is a typical greeting) and a zeal about countering stereotypes. \"There are eight million of us,\" he said, \"people have got to deal with us in a humane way.\" This show should go some way towards that goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
