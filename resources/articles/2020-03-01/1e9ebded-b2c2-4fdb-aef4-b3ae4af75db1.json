Instead, they elected to do the opposite to try and spin their way out of trouble. It didn\u2019t work. To recap, the semi-finals of the competition did not contain a provision for a reserve day in the event of rain. In turn, England and Australia \u2013 the lower qualified teams for their final four clashes \u2013 were in the gun at the SCG. If the downpour didn\u2019t stop, they would be eliminated without a ball being bowled. That turned out to be the fate for Heather Knight\u2019s team with India getting the golden ticket. If nine additional minutes were lost in the second semi, Australia would have been washed out of contention with them. Instead, that nightmare scenario \u2013 after so much time and money invested in filling the MCG for the final \u2013 has been avoided. But just because organisers got their dream decider doesn\u2019t mean the ridiculous situation should now be forgotten about. Kevin Roberts, Cricket Australia\u2019s boss, said during the week that they had put a polite inquiry into the International Cricket Council about whether a reserve day might be made available on Friday. It was rejected out of hand because it wasn\u2019t in the playing conditions before the tournament. Conversation over. \u201cIt gives you cause to reflect and think about how you might improve things in the future,\u201d Roberts said. Well, little good that does Knight and co now, the England skipper declaring in the aftermath that she hopes this never happens again. In practice, it meant that, after they lost their first game on the opening weekend, there was no way they could make the final. The ICC\u2019s response? Contrition at the oversight? Hardly. \u201cAllowing for any other reserve days would have extended the length of the event, which isn\u2019t feasible,\u201d a spokesman said when reflecting on why there wasn\u2019t a shift when the brutal weather forecast was seen. It doesn\u2019t pass the sniff test. How would playing on Friday have extended this event? By way of comparison, there were reserve days built in for last year\u2019s men\u2019s 50-over World Cup semi-finals. Then, in the case of the first fixture, two days were needed to complete a game in which New Zealand overcame India in a stunning contest; without without access to the spare day, the Black Caps would have been eliminated. More pertinently with respect to the ICC line, the second semi factored this in too. Had there been rain on that occasion, the game would have been completed on that Friday afternoon ahead of a Sunday final. Yes, the logistics were a challenge and putting the show on again at the SCG on Friday would have been costly. But what price the reputational damage for the biggest standalone women\u2019s cricket tournament ever staged to not think of this? Of course, India and South Africa would have been entitled to reject the workaround had it been put to them. But both captains hinted it would have been fine with them. After South Africa\u2019s narrow loss to Australia, Proteas skipper Dane van Niekerk, said she would rather \u201close than get a free pass\u201d to a final. It wouldn\u2019t have been a free pass \u2013 they played well to top their group after knocking off England to begin \u2013 but her point stands. What must happen now is a full reconciliation on how the initial decision was arrived at by the organising committee and participating nations. In particular, how wasn\u2019t it considered that hosting a semi-final in the city that has more days of international cricket lost to rain than any other in Australia \u2013 in Sydney\u2019s wettest month of the year \u2013 wasn\u2019t a risk worth insuring against? Much like the boundary countback farrago in last year\u2019s World Cup Super Over, somebody should have picked this up. What decision-makers can\u2019t do now is double down when the men\u2019s World Cup rolls around in October. It might mean copping some blowback for getting it right for the men after neglecting to so for the women, but the public relations gymnastics required there will be the price of doing the sensible thing. It\u2019s just a shame they didn\u2019t bother with it this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
