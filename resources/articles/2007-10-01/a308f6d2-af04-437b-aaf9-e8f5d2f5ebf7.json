The country is deadlocked after its fourth national election since the revolution. Viktor Yanukovich, who sparked the popular revolt by trying to steal a presidential election, is a new man - or so he would have us believe. Once seen as Moscow's loyal servant, Mr Yanukovich's Party of the Regions is still blue in colour and derives its support from the Russian-speaking industrial east. But now a US firm of PR consultants helps him soften his post-Soviet image, and he claims he is a Ukrainian nationalist. His party is on course to win Sunday's parliamentary election, although he will need to form a coalition if he is to continue as prime minister. The other winner is Yulia Tymoshenko, a neoliberal orange revolutionary, who has harvested popular discontent against the rich and powerful, despite being both herself. She, too, claims the right to form a new government. The only undoubted loser is Our Ukraine, the party of President Viktor Yushchenko. It was his pockmarked face from dioxin poisoning that symbolised the dirty fight to wrestle Ukraine from the grip of authoritarian government. But after three years of political chaos, his options have narrowed considerably. He either has to bury the hatchet with his former orange partner Ms Tymoshenko (whom he sacked as prime minister two years ago amid bitter recriminations) or he has to get into bed with Mr Yanukovich. Neither appeals. Forget the sea of orange tents in Kiev three years ago. Mr Yushchenko views his former partner Ms Tymoshenko as his nemesis and would still do almost anything to prevent her becoming prime minister again. It would be easier for him to form a coalition with his ideological foe Mr Yanukovich. Moderate businessmen in both orange and blue camps pushed their respective leaders to call this election, in the hope that the two would go into a coalition as a result. But Mr Yushchenko must also think about his prospects of being re-elected president in two or three years time. His party is already trailing badly in third place and could disappear altogether, after several years in partnership with Mr Yanukovich's professional party machine. Much will depend on deals struck with the smaller parties - the communists, the socialists and a party formed of people once allied to the former president Leonid Kuchma. There are some positives to be drawn from this. This was a fair election, and there is now more democracy in Ukraine three years on. But it is in a state of permanent political crisis, and for this it has its inadequate leaders to thank."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
