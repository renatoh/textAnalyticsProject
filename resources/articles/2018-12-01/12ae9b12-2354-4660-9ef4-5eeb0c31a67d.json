The former United striker, who has been placed in charge at Old Trafford for the remainder of the season, told MUTV in his first interview: \u201cIt\u2019s great. It feels like coming home, I have to say. It\u2019s been a few whirlwind days, of course, it\u2019s been very hectic, but it\u2019s just great to see everyone again.\u201d The Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has been identified as the preferred long-term replacement for Mourinho but Solskj\u00e6r is keen to make an impact. \u201cWell, it\u2019s six months and I\u2019m going to enjoy the ride,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s about just being myself. Manchester United is in my heart and it\u2019s brilliant to be coming back in this role. I\u2019m really looking forward to working with the very talented squad we have, the staff and everyone at the club. I know the club is now running a process to find the next manager, so I\u2019m just going to be myself in the meantime with Mick [Phelan] and Kieran [McKenna] and Michael [Carrick] and the rest of the staff.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r, who could be without Romelu Lukaku for his first two matches in charge after the striker was reportedly taking compassionate leave, was keen to underline the importance of uniting the club and restoring pride after a turbulent few months under Mourinho. \u201cWhen I scored on my debut it was a brilliant feeling. You felt comfortable at Old Trafford and you want the players to feel at home there too. \u201cIt\u2019s about the players being proud of their performance and the fans being proud of their team. We\u2019ll just get the players enjoying football, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the supporters again. \u201cWe want to see the players express themselves. I\u2019m proud of my career as a player. I understand this club, I know the club. Being in the gaffer\u2019s seat is very special.\u201d The 45-year-old also offered up the suggestion that players such as Paul Pogba, who had fallen out of favour under Mourinho\u2019s watch, would be given a chance to resume their United careers. \u201cEveryone in the squad knows that \u2018I\u2019ve got a chance now\u2019 because whatever has gone, whatever has happened has happened. Now it\u2019s just about from here. \u201cEveryone starts with a clean slate and we want players to perform, and we\u2019ll give them the chance. We have got 23, 24 players, they\u2019re all quality and they\u2019ll all get a chance now. With the amount of games coming up, they have got a chance to show that they are Manchester United players.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
