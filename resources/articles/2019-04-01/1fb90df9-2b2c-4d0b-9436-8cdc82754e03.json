The unnamed officer had just sat down when he spotted the wanted man, who had been on the run since receiving a prison sentence for assorted drugs offences and aggravated assault against a public official. \u201cHe never showed up to serve his sentence, so was naturally on a wanted list,\u201d said Christoffer Bohman, deputy chief of police in the Stockholm suburb of Rinkeby. \u201cThis officer was off duty, and by coincidence \u2013 and somewhat comically \u2013 both men recognised each other in the sauna.\u201d Bohman praised the officer for his calm response to what could otherwise have become a particularly heated confrontation, saying the arrest was effected in a thoroughly professional and undramatic manner. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously much easier to act when you have colleagues with you, plus all the right tools and equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was about as stripped-back and bare-bones an arrest as it is possible to make, in several senses of the term.\u201d Bohman also paid tribute to the officer in a Facebook post, describing him as a \u201ctop colleague who kept a cool head even when things were hotting up to a potentially dangerous situation, and despite being on your day off and in a sauna.\u201d The arrest was carried out \u201cwith due consideration to the best interests of all concerned\u201d, he said, adding: \u201cWe are everywhere. Even if you do not see us, we are there.\u201d The wanted criminal will now serve his sentence, Bohman said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
