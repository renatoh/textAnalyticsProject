Publicis, the world's fourth largest advertising group, said sales for the three months to the end of March were \u00a3590m, compared with \u00a3615m for the same period last year. Exchange rate fluctuations accounted for \u00a348m in lost revenues - and \u00a341m of that was down to the weakness of the US dollar, Publicis said. But excluding the effect of currency fluctuations, acquisitions and disposals, the group said its underlying revenues had grown 4.4%. Organic growth was at its lowest in Europe - where Publicis, which owns agencies such as Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Leo Burnett, reported revenues of \u00a3240m. In contrast, revenues in Latin America - where the company's two biggest markets are Mexico and Brazil - rose by 21%, while it saw rises of 20% in China and 55% in Indonesia. The chairman and chief executive of Publicis, Maurice Levy, said the figures reflected the advertising recovery which began last year, especially in North America, Latin America and in Asia. \"I remain entirely confident of prospects for the industry for the current year, and think that the pace will pick up, particularly in Europe during the second part of the year,\" Mr Levy said in a statement. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
