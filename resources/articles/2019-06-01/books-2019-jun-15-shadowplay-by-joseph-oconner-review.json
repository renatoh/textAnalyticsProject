It is easy to imagine these three magnificent characters refusing to be abandoned on the airwaves, and O\u2019Connor has given them an appropriately grand stage in the breathtaking Shadowplay. It opens with a letter from Stoker to Terry in 1908, explaining the conceit of the book: \u201ca clutch of diary pages and private notes I kept on and off down the years and had begun working up into a novel ... or perhaps a play\u201d. In the subsequent story within a story, Stoker hops from the first to third person, sometimes describing scenes at which he is not present, and introducing sections in \u201cthe voice of Ellen Terry\u201d. As he says to his hero Irving, on their first meeting: \u201cLife without imagination would be an unending hell.\u201d But as Irving replies: \u201cIs it not that anyway?\u201d This is as much a novel about existential struggle as greasepaint \u2013 though there is plenty of that, too. Henry Irving stopped mid scene and stared down at them grimly, his eyes glowing red in the gaslight. Paint dribbling down the contours of his face, like dye splashed on a map, droplets falling on his boots, his doublet and long locks drenched in sweat, his silver painted wooden sword glittering in the gaslight, shimmering with his chainmail in the lightning. Stoker leaves Dublin for London to run Irving\u2019s theatre, the Lyceum, taking his new wife, Flo, with him. He soon discovers that the actor is a drunk and a narcissist, wild-tempered, generous and vain. It is impossible not to fall in love with him, just as it is impossible not to fall for the divinely charismatic Terry. The friendship between the three, their fallings-out and reunions, are the heart of the book \u2013 poor \u201cnoble\u201d Flo can\u2019t compete. The problem with novels about towering historical figures is that most often the author hasn\u2019t the wit or brilliance to capture them, but Shadowplay is a book undaunted. One gives up wondering what is true, because it all is. Huge names come and go: Oscar Wilde has a tragicomic cameo; Jack the Ripper terrorises the London streets; WB Yeats is glimpsed on a Dublin bridge, \u201ca silverback gorilla in a monocle\u201d, his appearance serving only to fire Stoker\u2019s need to escape to London. Stoker seeks himself, and must lose himself to do it. There is much discussion of the self and identity in Shadowplay: good selves, shadow selves, hidden selves, Jekyll and Hyde selves. Sexuality and gender are shapeshifting, and there could be no better place to explore them than O\u2019Connor\u2019s vagabond world of theatre, where his characters may throw off their disguises amid the playacting. \u201cThis is how they escape the prison of the self. To see the world through the windows of someone else\u2019s room.\u201d And all the time, Count Dracula is in the wings, waiting \u2013 or we are waiting for him. As Stoker\u2019s immortal work grows in his subconscious, the clues mount up. At their first meeting, Irving says to Stoker, \u201cI don\u2019t bite\u201d; a Jonathan Harker comes to work at the theatre; a ghost named Mina haunts the dilapidated Lyceum at night. There is a book on theatrical effects by an Edward Helsing and a man in a lunatic asylum eats insects in his cell. The pieces of the jigsaw gather, and it is a relief when Stoker at last begins to write. All the wildness, wit and passion don\u2019t come without a price in Shadowplay, any more than in life. As the Victorian era shifts into the new century, what has been gothic and thrilling becomes grotesque in the light of modernity. Never has that reputedly gilded era seemed so pale or flat. As much as this is a hugely entertaining book about the grand scope of friendship and love, it is also, movingly \u2013 at times, agonisingly \u2013 a story of transience, loss and true loyalty. Fittingly for a novel that flirts with Dracula, Shadowplay also dances with death. \u201cWhere did it go?\u201d asks Ellen. \u201cThat mad, blazing time when we swirled the stars in the sky.\u201d \u2022 Sadie Jones\u2019s The Snakes is published by Chatto.
