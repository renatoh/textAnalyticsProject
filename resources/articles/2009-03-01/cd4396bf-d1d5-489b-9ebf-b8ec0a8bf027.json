Governor Bill Richardson has opposed a repeal in the past, but now says he would consider signing it. \"I haven't made a final decision,\" the governor said this week. The state senate voted 24-18 today in favour of the bill, which replaces capital punishment with a sentence of life without parole. The house approved it a month ago. New Mexico, one of 36 states with capital punishment, has two men on death row whose sentences would not be affected by repeal. The state has executed one man since 1960, convicted child killer Terry Clark in 2001. New Jersey banned executions in 2007, the first state to do so since the US supreme court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Opponents of the death penalty said it does not deter murder and is administered unfairly, and that there's a risk of executing innocent people. \"As beautiful as our justice system is ... it is still a justice system of human beings, and human beings make mistakes,\" state senator Cisco McSorley, a Democrat from Albuquerque, said during nearly three hours of debate. Death penalty supporters objected that murderers sentenced to life without parole could end up in the general prison population, and argued that locking up murderers for life could imperil corrections officers. \"There's no incentive for not killing a guard every time you get a chance,\" said state senator Rod Adair, a Republican. He called capital punishment \"a just penalty for the most heinous of crimes in our society\". Opponents of repeal also said the death penalty is an important tool for prosecutors, who had asked lawmakers not to pass the bill. New Mexico was one of at least 11 states considering banning executions this year. Repeal legislation has passed the state senate in Montana and awaits a house hearing. The state senate in Kansas is expected to debate a repeal bill on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
