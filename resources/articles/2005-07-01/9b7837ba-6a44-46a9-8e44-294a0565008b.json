How much money do I need to owe? What are the first steps and who do I need to talk to? BC A New legislation in recent years has removed a lot of the problems resulting from going bankrupt and also provided a lot of alternative measures. Traditionally creditors initiate bankruptcy proceedings. There is no specific amount involved. It depends on how keen creditors are to pursue the matter and the sums can be quite small. However you may find it better to go for voluntary liquidation with the consent of your creditors. As a first step it would probably be best to consult your local Citizens' Advice Bureau, since they have a good deal of experience in this area and will be able to assess what is the right thing for you to do. You might also find it useful to surf the internet for information. I tried one of the main search engines and it came up with a host of websites on the subject. Most of them are trying to sell their services, but they will also provide background information that should help you decide what to do. It should be a lot cheaper than seeking legal advice. Guardian Money has also published a Bankruptcy Q&amp;A which covers the basics and offers help in deciding whether to file."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
