England had been humiliated by Croatia in their last competitive fixture, leaving their qualification for Euro 2008 in serious doubt and faith in the regime was waning. Fast forward and, at the same venue last night, Fabio Capello addressed a more promising future from a position of complete and utter strength. The contrast between England managers past and present could not have been more stark. Capello's English may remain rusty but there is clarity of thinking where, not long ago, all seem muddled. The national side top their qualification group with a perfect points tally and confront Holland, already qualified for South Africa 2010 with an equally faultless record, with the head coach unwilling to accept that his team has fulfilled its potential. The last time England began a season that culminated in a World Cup finals, they were humbled 4-1 in their opening friendly fixture in Denmark. Capello will not tolerate a repeat. The Italian did not betray any satisfaction at his achievements to date yesterday but, instead, spoke of maintaining this team's development. \"I have to improve different situations because, while sometimes we play for 20 minutes very well, sometimes we sleep a little bit,\" he offered. \"Similarly, we don't always play with the same aggression we are capable of all the time. We have to make sure we play 90 minutes at that level. That is a really important step. It's about consistency in performance. We can do this but we need to play with intelligence. We are a really good team who must play with our own style, but we will be playing very important sides. We need to adapt and learn.\" England's two set-backs under this regime have come against A-list opposition in France and Spain. The visit to Amsterdam could prove just as awkward as those evenings in Paris and Seville though, already, the Capello effect appears to be bolstering confidence within the ranks. John Terry's assertion that England can be contenders next summer was based on the impression made by the management on a group that had previously under-performed. \"That bit of quality separates the good from the great managers, and this manager is a great manager,\" said the captain. \"Jose Mourinho had that, and Fabio does too. \"It's about transmitting that confidence to each other. That's what a great coach gives you. You come in at half-time and [Capello] hates it if the lads are talking or shouting at each other. Arguing. You can come in all hot-headed wanting better from your team-mates but he shuts us up, wants us sitting there quietly to absorb what has just happened and take it in, then approach things in a calmer way. He wants two or three minutes of silence. Then he can go mad himself. He's more than capable of getting the hair-dryer out, giving us a kick up the backside, but he recognises the importance of staying relaxed and focused. \"We know there'll be times in games where we won't have the ball and our opponents dominate possession but it's about staying compact and patient. He stresses that. It's an Italian thing. Carlo Ancelotti has the same mentality: don't be frightened when you lose the ball. Keep your shape, stay together and then, when you get the ball back, make it count. But we're still learning. We're not where we want to be yet. We've got another 10 or 15% to go. When we do, we'll be at the top of our game. We can improve here. Before the game in Spain we probably thought we were one of the best teams in the world. Actually, that showed us where we want to be.\" Capello is edging them towards that ideal in the hope that, with qualification secured as soon as possible and no major injuries sustained over the course of a gruelling season, this team can carry momentum to South Africa. Frank Lampard spoke of this campaign offering England's players an opportunity to make an \"imprint in history\" this week. That is a sentiment with which the Italian in charge agrees. \"Those were very important words from one of the leaders of this team,\" he added. \"I think the other players think the same. This is a really important season for them, just as it is for me in my first international job. It will be really important but, first, we have to get to the finals. Then, once that is achieved, we will focus on what we can do at the World Cup.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
