You can buy them in three-for-two or two-for-\u00a310 offers at most of the bookselling chains. WH Smith has come up with a more original incentive: Little Reads, priced at \u00a31 each, containing extracts from the novels, along with vouchers for \u00a31 off the complete editions. The retailer wants to arouse the interest of people who come into its shops looking for magazines or stationery rather than books; but it has not convinced everyone that these customers will be prepared to pay \u00a31, even with a voucher, for a sampler. Unfortunately, one of the sceptics is Penguin, which is likely to have exclusive licences to a fair percentage of the 100, and which has declined to grant rights for the promotion. \"The Big Read itself is a huge marketing endorsement, and we want to convert this into sales of whole books,\" Penguin says. \u00b7 Following the merger last week of two independent publishers, Duckworth and Overlook, comes news that two independent booksellers are joining forces. Sportspages and Sports Books Direct are complementary businesses, the former selling sports books from shops in London and Manchester and the latter specialising in mail order. If you want to compete against big businesses, the theory goes, you have to specialise; and it is certainly true that Sportspages and SBD benefit from unrivalled expertise in their field and from the loyalty of their customers. Nevertheless, the competition is tough: Sportspages in Charing Cross Road is near Borders and Foyles, both of which have excell- ent sports departments; and the book clubs and amazon.co.uk are formidable rivals too. The merged company will be better equipped to fight its corner. \u00b7 David Gemmell, the fantasy novelist, wrote in these pages last week about the \"disdain\" with which the literary world regards his genre. The blurb for Gemmell's new novel does convey a rather specialist flavour (\"Following the terrible triumph at Perapolis, the General had taken the legendary Swords of Night and Day and ridden from the lands of Naashan\"); but that impression would be wrong, according to research carried out for HarperCollins' Voyager list. The researchers found that readers of fantasy fiction were not monomaniac devotees but were also readers of other genres and general fiction. Voyager is responding to the findings by jettisoning stock sword-and-sorcery images from the covers of star authors including Raymond E Feist and David and Leigh Eddings. The publisher is also trying to persuade booksellers not to confine these titles to the fantasy shelves. \u00b7 A centre dedicated to the life and work of Roald Dahl is to open in November 2004 in the late author's home town, Great Missenden, in Buckinghamshire. Costing nearly \u00a34m, the centre will house Dahl's archive, including original drafts of his books, and will employ writers and illustrators in residence. One attraction will be a replica of the hut - or possibly the original construction - in which Dahl wrote. \u00b7 Waterstone's has recently been concentrating on refurbishing its existing shops, but has also just announced its first opening since that of its giant branch in Piccadilly, London. The new shop will be in the Trafford Centre, Manchester, home of the chain's celebrated Deansgate branch. Meanwhile, a buoyant Ottakar's, which largely does not compete head-to-head with its rival, is to take on Waterstone's by opening a branch in the centre of Coventry. Waterstone's says: \"We welcome the competition.\" The Micro-chart Music biography 1 Robbie Williams: Somebody Someday by Williams/McCrum (Ebury \u00a37.99) 2 Kurt Cobain: The Journals by Kurt Cobain (Viking \u00a320) 3 Kylie: La La La by Minogue/Baker (Hodder \u00a320) 4 Learning to Fly by Victoria Beckham (Penguin \u00a36.99) 5 Heavier Than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain by Charles Cross (Sceptre \u00a37.99) 6 Gareth Gates: Right from the Start by Sian Solanas (Virgin \u00a39.99) 7 The Rolling Stones: Unseen Archives (Parragon \u00a39.99) 8 Geri: Just for the Record by Geri Halliwell (Ebury \u00a317.99) 9 Lulu: I Don't Want to Fight by Lulu (Time Warner \u00a317.99) 10 How To DJ by Broughton/Brewster (Bantam Press \u00a314.99) \u00b7 Nicholas Clee is editor of the Bookseller.
