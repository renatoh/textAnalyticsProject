Typically FGM is performed with a razor blade on girls between the ages of four and 12, traditionally without anaesthetic. \"Type one FGM would be like removing a male\u2019s testes, type three is equivalent to removing both the testes and the penis. There is no way that would be deemed acceptable,\" says Taina Bien Aime, director of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, who adds that comparisons between male and female circumcision are unhelpful. FGM can lead to severe bleeding, pain, complete loss of sensitivity, complications during childbirth, infertility, severe pain during sex, recurring infections and urine retention. And in some cases it is lethal. Unlike male circumcision, female genital mutilation also inhibits sexual pleasure. It is agreed that female gential mutilation has no health benefits and surgery is sometimes required in later life to open-up or seal the vagina again. Campaign groups and survivors of FGM warn that despite legislation against female genital mutilation in the US, American girls are being taken out of the country to be cut, and may be subjected to mutilation on US soil. The number of American women and girls affected or at risk is believed to have grown by 35 per cent to at least 228,000 between 1997 and 2000, according to the African women\u2019s health center of Brigham and Women\u2019s hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Approximately 6000 girls are mutilated around the world every day. FGM can be performed in different ways, with the main three: clitoridectemy, excision and infibulation. Type 1: Clitoridectemy This involves partial or complete cutting of the clitoris, the most sensitive part of the genitals. On rare occasions, only the fold of skin around the clitoris is cut, which is called the prepuce. This procedure requires a great deal of skill and precision, which can be impossible if the victim is not under anaesthetic. Type 2: Excision In this case, the clitoris is cut off and so are the inner lips (the labia minora) and in some cases the outer lips (labia majora) as well. Type 3: Infibulation Type three is when all of the external parts of the genitals are cut off or repositioned. The opening of the vagina is narrowed and sealed by sewing or stapling together the two sides of the vulva. A very small single opening remains through which urine and menstrual fluid must pass. Aside from these three main types, a further fourth type encompasses any other non-medical incision, piercing, scraping or pricking of the genitalia. The practice predates all religions and has been seen in the mummified bodies of pharaoh princesses. A lack of widespread knowledge and information about FGM is putting American girls at risk, says Shelby Quast, policy advisor at the campaign group Equality Now. \"We look at the various diaspora communities and as they grow, the number of girls at risk grows as well.\" The Guardian along with Congressman Joe Crowley, Ban Ki Moon and over 38,000 people are backing Jaha Dukureh's campaign asking the US government to update statistics on at-risk girls in the US as the first step towards an action plan to end FGM in the US.
