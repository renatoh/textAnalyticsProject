Sancho put Borussia Dortmund on course for a 4-0 win at lowly Stuttgart to maintain their three-point lead at the top of the table. Nelson, the Arsenal forward on loan at Hoffenheim, struck twice as Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s side came from behind to win 3-1 at N\u00fcrnberg. Dortmund struck three times in the opening 25 minutes to crush Stuttgart. Sancho put them ahead with a deflected effort in the third minute before Marco Reus launched their attack for the second goal and finished it off with a fine shot in the 23rd. Paco Alc\u00e1cer continued his spectacular scoring run two minutes later with his seventh league goal this season, and becoming the first Bundesliga player to require just 106 minutes of playing time to do so. Stuttgart attempted to force their way back into the game early in the second half but quickly ran out of ideas and Maximilian Philipp completed the rout late on . Dortmund have scored 27 goals, a club record after eight games. Hoffenheim fell behind at N\u00fcrnberg before Nelson, who starred twice for England Under-21s this week, launched a furious second-half comeback. He swivelled to volley home the equaliser five minutes after the break before drilling his second into the roof of the net from a tight angle. Adam Szalai completed the 17-minute turnaroundto seal victory. Bayern Munich survived a scare at Wolfsburg to end their winless streak with a 3-1 victory and go third in the Bundesliga. Robert Lewandowski grabbed two goals and an assist against his favourite league rival to end the reigning champions\u2019 four-game run without a win across all competitions. The Poland striker broke the deadlock with a clinical finish and then claimed his 18th goal in 16 appearances against Wolfsburg. But the hosts were given hope when Arjen Robben was sent off for a second yellow card in the 57th minute after a foul on Elvis Rexhbecaj. His first booking came for diving. Wout Weghorst pulled a goal back but James Rodr\u00edguez sealed the win. Werder Bremen remain in second after winning 2-0 at 18th-placed Schalke in the late game courtesy of two Maximilian Eggestein strikes. Leipzig dropped to fourth after a 0-0 draw at Augsburg. Distracted Juventus drop first points of season Juventus\u2019s perfect start to the season came to an end in Turin as Genoa earned a 1-1 Serie A draw on Ivan Juric\u2019s return as coach. The Croatian boss replaced Davide Ballardini before the international break for his third spell in charge of Genoa and he made an immediate impact as the Italian champions failed to record a victory for the first time in nine league games this season. Cristiano Ronaldo gave Juventus a deserved lead in a dominant first half but sloppy defending from the hosts allowed Daniel Bessa to draw Genoa level after the break. The Juventus coach, Massimiliano Allegri, blamed his players for being sidetracked by their Champions League trip to Manchester United on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cGenoa did well not to expose themselves, but these things shouldn\u2019t happen. We played for 10 minutes and then started thinking about Manchester. We went from being frenetic to falling asleep and vice versa. We should have had our mind on the job. It\u2019ll be very different with Manchester United, as we will both be playing to win.\u201d Napoli closed the gap on Juventus to four points with a 3-0 win at Udinese. Carlo Ancelotti was impressed by his side\u2019s clinical performance as gFabian Ruiz, Dries Mertens and Marko Rog completed a comfortable victory. \u201cThese are all tests of our maturity,\u201d said the manager. Roma fell to a 2-0 home defeat to 10-man Spal, who celebrated their first Serie A win at the Stadio Olimpico in 53 years. The visitors took the lead when Andrea Petagna converted a penalty then doubled their advantage when Kevin Bonifazi headed in a corner. The Spal goalkeeper, Vanja Milinkovic-Savic, younger brother of the Lazio midfielder Sergej, brilliantly fingertipped a Pellegrini effort on to the bar but he was soon booked for time-wasting. The 21-year-old Serbian received a second yellow card seconds later for petulantly throwing the ball away, leaving Spal with 10 men for the final 15 minutes. However, they clung on for a famous win. Henry faces up to size of Monaco task Thierry Henry watched his Monaco side slump to a sixth Ligue 1 defeat in 10 games as they fell 2-1 at Strasbourg in his first game in charge. Monaco were trying to cancel out an Adrien Thomasson header which goalkeeper Seydou Sy fumbled into his own net in the first half when Samuel Grandsir was shown a straight red for a dangerous challenge in the 66th minute. Henry had already had to replace Radamel Falcao, who limped off after 37 minutes. Lebo Mothiba chipped over the advancing Sy six minutes from time to seal the win before Youri Tielemans pulled a goal back from the penalty spot in stoppage time. Paris Saint-Germain made it a perfect 10 wins out of 10 with a 5-0 hammering of Amiens at the Parc Des Princes, while Lille beat Dijon 2-1 to stay in second place, eight points behind the leaders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
