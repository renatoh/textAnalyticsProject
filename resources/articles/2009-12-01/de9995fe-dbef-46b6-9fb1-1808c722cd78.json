The consulting company Accenture, which has used Woods since 2003, removed his image from its website on Friday and said it was reviewing its relationship. Its decision tonight was expected but the tone of its statement will have stunned Woods and his advisers. \"After careful consideration and analysis the company has determined that he is no longer the right representative for its advertising,\" the company said . Accenture is reported to be paying Woods $7m (\u00a34.3m) a year and it had used him extensively in adverts, urging customers in a 2006 campaign, \"Go on, be a Tiger\". In the light of Woods admitting \"infidelity\" as well as the allegations about his private life that have emerged over the last two weeks, it had become impossible for the company to continue to use him. It has to be assumed that Accenture invoked a \"morality\" clause which is included in all such sponsorship deals with high-profile athletes. The question now remains which of Woods's sponsors will follow suit. So far only Nike and EA Sports, the video game company, have offered unequivocal support after his announcement last week that he was taking an indefinite break from the sport. Significantly AT&amp;T, which has its name on the golfer's bag, has said it was \"re-evaluating\" its relationship with the world No1. Even Steve Williams, his long-time caddie, sought to distance himself today from his boss's personal behaviour. \"I had no knowledge of what Tiger's indiscretion was,\" Williams told the Sunday News in New Zealand. \"What people fail to realise is I [just] work for Tiger Woods. I live in New Zealand, I travel to and from New Zealand to caddie for Tiger Woods. Whilst I am a very good friend of his, I don't know what he does off the course. \"When he is not competing, I am back in New Zealand. I have no knowledge of what he is doing. Yes, I talk to him on the phone, ask him how his practice is going, how he is hitting the ball, how his family is, [but] I don't know what he is doing, just like he doesn't know what I am doing.\" Williams, who also has a home in Oregon, had spoken often through the years about his close friendship with Woods, who was the best man at his wedding, telling one interviewer: \"We've become very good mates, we socialise together. It's one of those things that's developed, not something I planned on happening.\" The caddie's remarks came as it was reported in the US that Woods's advisers had disagreed over how to handle the scandal that broke more than two weeks ago after the 33-year-old crashed a car outside his Florida home in the early hours of the morning, presaging a wave of allegations about his personal behaviour, with a string of women alleging to have had \"affairs\" with him. There was widespread disbelief in American media circles that the golfer and his advisers, most notably his long-time agent, Mark Steinberg of IMG, reacted to the ensuing publicity only via the player's website, and even then in the most limited sense. Until Friday's announcement that the world No1 would be taking an \"indefinite\" break following what he described as infidelities, his previous statements on the scandal had been limited to an admission of \"transgressions\" and a fierce criticism of what he called media intrusions. Woods's decision to remain out of public view since the car crash attracted ridicule, so much so that even a senior IMG executive joked publicly about him. Barry Frank, an executive vice-president with the sports agency, was asked what sports business story they would be following closely in the next year: \"How many girls Tiger was with,\" he replied."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
