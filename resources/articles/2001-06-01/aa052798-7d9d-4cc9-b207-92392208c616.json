The thin line between sanity and madness, the logical and the absurd, is held up for examination in Lucas's play, which has psychiatrist Dr Drabble threatening to have his patient Matthew sectioned if he doesn't help him abduct his wife, Polly, who has left him. Polly is resident in the Dice House, a therapy centre run by Dr Ratner, in which patients renounce free will and submit to the rule of the dice For every possible decision they might make, patients write down six options, throw a die and follow the one the die chooses. This explains why, when Drabble and Matthew turn up at the Dice House, Polly is dressed in leather, Dr Ratner is dressed as a woman and they have spent the morning shaving each other's pubic hair. Also present is Smith, who is being treated for his apparent delusion that he is being pursued by vengeful furies (or rather a man in a suit of armour with an outsize spoon) for his sins, which include \"having anal sex with a district nurse as she lay dying in the wreckage of her Austin Metro\". Smith has just returned from having gay sex with a waiter called Andrew. The dice told him to. You will gather from all this that Lucas's play makes Joe Orton's comedies seem as decorous as a vicar's tea party, and if you enjoy bad-taste comedy, they hardly come more tasteless than this. It is very funny but never quite as funny as it thinks it is. In part, this is because, unlike Orton's plays, which heighten reality and take normality to the extreme so it becomes a kind of madness, Lucas's play is set in a madhouse where, with the exception of Smith, everyone behaves as if they were insane. There is a good play lurking in here, and Lucas proves again what a quirky talent he is. But the script needs to be deeper, tighter and more reflective and the production much sharper for this comedy to pass comment on the absurdity of our lives. Until June 30.
