Neil Entwistle, 27, appeared before Bow Street magistrates' court in an initial extradition hearing shortly before 6pm. He was detained by Metropolitan police officers, working on behalf of US authorities investigating the double killing, earlier today in London. Mr Entwistle's wife, Rachel, 27, and their nine-month-old daughter, Lillian, were found dead on January 22 under layers of bedding in the master bedroom of their home in Hopkinton, about 30 miles west of Boston, Massachusetts. They had been shot. Mr Entwistle, an unemployed computer programmer and internet entrepreneur, is thought to have left the US before the bodies were found. He was arrested by officers from the Metropolitan police's extradition unit at Royal Oak station in west London. During the five-minute hearing at the magistrates' court, Mr Entwistle spoke to confirm his name, age and address, which he gave as Worksop, and to indicate that he understood the double murder charges against him. He confirmed that he would not consent to be extradited to the US \"at this stage\". The extradition proceedings were adjourned until tomorrow when Mr Entwistle will again appear before the court. The Home Office said that the US had issued a provisional request for Mr Entwistle's extradition. Such requests, issued in \"circumstances of urgency\", must then be certified within 60 days, for which the approval of the home secretary is required. A Massachusetts district attorney, Martha Coakley, told journalists in the US that Mr Entwistle faced allegations of two counts of murder, one of possession of a firearm and one of possession of ammunition. Mr Entwistle faces accusations that he shot his wife in the head and also his daughter, who was lying on the bed beside her, with a gun taken from the home of his father-in-law, Joseph Matterazzo, Ms Coakley said. \"We believe possibly that this was intended to be a murder suicide but we cannot confirm that,\" Ms Oakley said. \"What we believe happened next was that Neil Entwistle returned the gun to his father-in-law's home in Carver and that he then made preparations to leave the country. \"He purchased a one-way British Airways ticket at approximately 5am on Saturday morning, January 22, and he was on an 8.15am flight to the United Kingdom on that day.\" She said that following investigations in Massachusetts, including the forensic examination of a .22 handgun owned by Mr Matterazzo, and in the UK, American authorities believed they had \"probable cause\" to seek an arrest warrant for Mr Entwistle. \"For very good reason I must explain to you that Neil Entwistle is under arrest but he is innocent until proven guilty by a court in this country,\" Ms Coakley added. Tonight the family of Mrs Entwistle and Lillian said they were \"deeply saddened\" by the arrest of Mr Entwistle. Joe Flaherty, a family spokesman, said in a statement: \"The family is deeply saddened by the arrest of Neil Entwistle for the murder of Rachel and Lillian. They loved Neil very much. Neil was a trusted father and it is incomprehensible how their love was betrayed in the ultimate act of violence. \"We have always been confident that the case would be solved and that those responsible would be brought to justice.\" Before today's developments, Mr Entwistle had been categorised only as a \"person of interest\" by authorities in Massachusetts. On January 28, he was questioned - as a witness, not a suspect - by American officers at the US embassy in London. Mrs Entwistle and Lillian were found in an unmade bed by detectives performing a check on their home. Forensic tests suggested that the pair were killed one or two days before their bodies were discovered. There were no signs of a struggle or forced entry to the home. Mr Entwistle's car was later found at Logan airport in Boston, where he was understood to have boarded a flight to London on January 20. He had been staying with his parents, Clifford and Yvonne, at their home in Kilton, Worksop, since. No members of the Entwistle family attended a funeral service held for Mrs Entwistle and Lillian in Plymouth, Massachusetts, last Wednesday. Speakers at the funeral did not mention Mr Entwistle. The Entwistles met in England and were married in 2003. They had lived in Hopkinton for just 10 days before the murders. The couple posted happy messages and photographs on their personal website, which has been overwhelmed with messages of condolence. But Mr Entwistle's eBay business, where he sold get-rich-quick schemes and how-to manuals for pornography sites, ran into trouble and was shut down by eBay days before the murder after customer complaints."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
