That must now be the limit of Birmingham City's ambitions after their third successive home defeat continues a run that has seen them take only one point from a possible 15. Not only does their manager Trevor Francis agree, he is also starting to get twitchy about his side's chances of finishing in the top six. \"Automatic promotion is beyond us and we are at the stage where finishing in the play-offs is not certain,\" he said. \"We need to start picking up points quickly.\" Francis cites an extensive injury list as the reason for his side's decline but the catalogue of casualties does not include his four main strikers. The quartet were all available and all four were employed at some stage. Not that that was too apparent: all four failed to trouble the Wolves goalkeeper Michael Oakes, a shortcoming that did not escape Francis. \"Stan Lazaridis delivered some good crosses,\" he said, \"but we did not have the ability to get on the end of them. That is until David Holdsworth, a defender, went forward in the last five minutes and had two headers saved. That cannot be a coincidence.\" The Wolves striker George Ndah showed how chances should be taken when he effectively settled matters with barely 50 seconds gone. Set up by Carl Robinson's long clearance and with City's centre-backs making their way back following an abortive free-kick routine, Ndah galloped past the home rearguard before firing right-footed past the advancing Ian Bennett. It was the striker's third goal in two games; the previous two against West Bromwich Albion had given Jones his first taste of derby success. Yesterday's victory gave him more satisfaction. \"This is always a difficult place to come to,\" he said. \"Players have to stand up and be counted and my team did that superbly.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
