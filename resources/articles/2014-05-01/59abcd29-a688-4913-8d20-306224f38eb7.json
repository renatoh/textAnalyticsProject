The latest cuts come as NPR hustled to hit a balanced budget deadline imposed by its board and prepared to welcome a new CEO, Jarl Mohn, from the world of entertainment television \u2013 a seemingly distant commute from the leafy precincts of the mind where public radio thrives. Tell Me More host Michel Martin, who will remain with the organization, expressed sadness and vowed to continue the show\u2019s mission of creating a space on public radio for minority listeners. \"We've done a lot to show what's possible here and I want to keep that going,\" Martin public radio\u2019s David Folkenflik. \"I can't say you need to do better at serving these audiences and then walk away from it. I don't think that's fair.\" The elimination of Tell Me More and the earlier buyouts were projected to save NPR $7m in the coming year, according to Folkenfilk. NPR\u2019s 2011 operating budget was $174.7m. The board had demanded a balanced budget for the 2015 fiscal year, after years of deficits and constant fund-raising pressure. The organization had come in for criticism last year for building a glitzy new headquarters in Washington, DC, at a reported cost of $201m. \"We're trying to make the most of the resources that we have and ensure that we keep radio healthy and try to develop audience in the digital arena,\" executive vice-president Kinsey Wilson was quoted by Folkenflik as saying about Tuesday\u2019s development. But the cancellation of Tell Me More, and the pace of change at the top, pointed for some observers to a low-level identity crisis that has plagued the organization for years. Even as it depends on member stations for subscription fees, NPR has been building a national profile, online and on the air, that could be seen as competing with its local outlets. Jack W Mitchell, the founding producer of All Things Considered and a three-time chairman of NPR's board of directors, has written a critically acclaimed history of NPR called Listener Supported: The Culture and History of Public Radio. In an interview with the Guardian on Tuesday, Mitchell pointed to the hiring of Mohn, a former MTV executive and president of E! Entertainment Television, as a sign that NPR is adrift. Mohn, who is scheduled to take the reins on 1 July, will be NPR\u2019s fifth CEO since 2009. \u201cAny other national institution would select its leader from among the best practitioners in the business,\u201d said Mitchell, now a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cPublic radio has never chosen a regional station manager to head the organization, even though some have been highly successful and could do the job. It has never picked a president who came up through the organization.\" \u201cThat suggests to me that the public radio system has little confidence in its own people and is always looking for someone to come in and \u2018save\u2019 it, to take it in a new direction, when the old direction wasn't doing all that badly. [I] don't know why exactly, but that is definitely the pattern, including the current choice, whom I assume knows little about public radio.\u201d The NPR board welcomed Mohn with enthusiasm earlier this month. Director Kit Jensen said Mohn had \"an ability to find nuanced and new ideas\", according to Folkenflik. Tell Me More host Martin blamed her show\u2019s cancellation on the revolving door at the top of the organization. Since 2009, NPR has had five CEOs, including Vivian Schiller, now with Twitter, who was ousted after back-to-back controversies involving incendiary comments by host Juan Williams and a secret recording of an NPR fundraiser denigrating political conservatives. \"To be honest with you, I think we've been casualties of executive churn,\" Martin told Folkenfilk. \"Every CEO who has been at this network since I've been here \u2014 and how many are there now? Six? Seven? \u2013 all of them have supported this program, but none of them have stayed around long enough to institutionalize that support.\" Mitchell traced the organization\u2019s current crossroads to the departure of president Kevin Klose in 2008, after ten years atop the organization. Before joining NPR, Klose was president of Radio Free Europe and a 25-year veteran of the Washington Post. \u201cThey really want to become a major player in American media, and that was never seen as the primary goal of the organization,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cPrior to this, they had a very nice niche, and it\u2019s, I believe, sustainable. But they want to broaden the audience \u2026 they want to have something for everyone and that just may be too much, even though there\u2019s an enormous amount of ability there.\u201d Wilson, the NPR executivce vice-president inssisted that the organisation remained committed to diverse audiences. \"We're in a different era than we were, even in five or six years ago,\" Wilson told Folkenflik. \"There is in fact an opportunity to reach a larger audience across platforms \u2026 not simply through principally a once-a-day broadcast show.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
