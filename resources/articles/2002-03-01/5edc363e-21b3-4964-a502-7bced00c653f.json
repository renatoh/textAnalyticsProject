Marcus Russell, the Ebbw Vale chairman, said the six, Newport, Llanelli, Swansea, Pontypridd, Cardiff and Bridgend, who have formed themselves into Rugby Partnership Wales, had been duped. Under the agreement, the product of three days of talks with the six clubs and their players, the WRU promised to meet their demand and reduce the number of sides in the top flight to six \"when it was legally practicable\". But Russell, who does not believe the WRU can deliver on the promise, said: \"The WRU has managed to wriggle off a sharp hook, buying time by making a promise it cannot keep for another five years and I am amazed that RPW, clubs who pride themselves on their business acumen, fell for it.\" The WRU has said that the selection of the six clubs would be completed by May 1 this year, at least 16 months before the league was reduced, but Russell did not believe that it would happen. Ebbw Vale signed an agreement with the WRU in 1998 guaranteeing them a top-flight place for 10 years and Russell explained: \"Our agreement with the WRU says there will be no fewer than eight clubs in the top flight and the union's own legal advisers have told them that if we go to court, they would have a less than 50-50 chance of defeating us. \"RPW failed to take into account that Ebbw Vale was the only club in Wales whose status was guaranteed until 2007: if there is a reduction to six we are guaranteed a place, but I do not think it will come to that.\" The RPW clubs engineered the dispute, saying that unless the WRU reduced the number of sides in the top division from nine to six and provided them with \u00a31.5m funding each year, they would consider making their players unavailable to Wales. They warned that the owners who bankrolled the six would consider pulling out their support leading to drastic pay cuts and redundancies with the leading players moving to England or France. It was only when the Wales squad players, led by the captain Scott Quinnell, vowed to go on strike that the WRU took things seriously. It called a special meeting of its general committee last Thursday and, on the recommendation of its rugby director, Terry Cobner, agreed to the reduction to six when legally possible to do so. The clubs and the players were unhappy with that, saying the strike would go ahead unless the WRU committed itself to the change from next season. But on Sunday, following a seven-hour meeting the previous day, RPW declared peace on legal advice. Under the union's constitution, 12 months' notice has to be given of any change to the league structure so nothing could happen until the season after next. \"RPW have made a number of tactical mistakes,\" said Russell. \"They chose to involve only five, and then six, of the leading Welsh sides even though the original intention was to involve all nine of us. It was a divisive move which led to needless ill-feeling and gave the WRU the chance to divide and rule. RPW were willing to see Ebbw Vale, Neath and Caerphilly cease to exist as professional entities and we were not going to stand idly by and let that happen.\" Russell said an opportunity had been lost. \"If the nine clubs had stuck together we could have put pressure on the WRU to have implemented the working party chaired by Sir Tasker Watkin on the running of the game in Wales. \"There is a desperate need to change the leadership at the top but the union will cling on because while the top clubs have been fighting each other, the WRU's leaders have been harnessing their resources on ensuring that the working party report is buried, which means that those who depend on the game for their careers and livelihoods will be at the mercy of amateurs. \"Welsh rugby should have the means to fund 10 or 12 clubs in a premier division, but it seems the huge debt burden brought on by the building of the Millennium Stadium is dragging us all down. It is an absolute mess and the state of our game does no credit to any of us. I cannot see it getting any better.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
