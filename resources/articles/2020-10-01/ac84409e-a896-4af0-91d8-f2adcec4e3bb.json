With coronavirus infection rates rising and restrictions on travel, Southgate said that England would be able to host the tournament if the decision was taken to slim down the number of host nations to only a few or even one. \u201cI think what is possible and what looks possible is going to have changed frequently over the next few months,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe honestly don\u2019t know. You couldn\u2019t stand with any certainty and say the Euros will take place next year. You couldn\u2019t stand with certainty and say it is going to take place in the format it is expected to. \u201cWe would definitely be capable of hosting. We are due to host a lot of games at Wembley anyway so I don\u2019t think that will change, but it really is an unknown what the format might end up looking like. It is impossible to predict and we have to be ready to adapt to whatever is thrown our way.\u201d The England manager is preparing for Sunday\u2019s Nations League tie against Belgium at Wembley, having overseen an encouraging 3-0 friendly win over Wales on Thursday night when he stuck with the 3-4-3 system he tried in last month\u2019s 0-0 draw with Denmark. Southgate appears to be leaning towards the approach, having favoured 4-3-3 since the 2018 World Cup in Russia, partly as he believes it better guards against the lack of options at left-back and in defensive midfield. \u201cWe feel it suits the personnel that we\u2019ve got very strongly and we think it also gives us strength-in-depth if we have problems losing players,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of systems where, if one or two key personnel aren\u2019t available, then you potentially have to change tack.\u201d Southgate said last October that he would consider a switch back to a three-man defence. \u201cWe feel that there are so many nuances to these things that we can really advance it,\u201d Southgate said, with regard to honing a system to win at a tournament. \u201cWe recognised that ahead of Russia and have felt the same for a reasonable while but there are certain players who are emerging who are helping us to really consolidate that thinking. \u201cIt means in certain positions there will be really intense competition but we need that. The players in the end are going to fight it out whereas a little bit in the 4-3-3, in two or three positions we are quite light of depth and, if we have one or two injuries, we are really short. Part of our thinking is in that depth of talent in all of the positions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
