Music I enjoy chart music. Films Lost in Translation, Watership Down, Donnie Darko and Muriel's Wedding. Television I'm never in to watch TV, but when I am I like Extras and The Office. Heroes My mum and dad because they are good role models. My latest blog I've learnt that I need to work on my strategic skills, which would help me to take the lead on new training initiatives. Advice to graduates Don't worry if you don't know what you want to do. Just grab every opportunity you get because you never know which skills you pick up while temping, volunteering etc, that'll come in handy later. My first job at Allen &amp; Overy gave me a chance to use many of the skills I built up over the years, including skills learnt during a year spent in Australia working in accounts for Toyota. What I'd like to do next? I want to stay in training and development, in the legal sector. I built up a good knowledge of the skills a lawyer needs to be successful in my previous job where I had to organise training programmes to help lawyers develop their technical skills. At Fox Williams I provide courses to help lawyers develop their soft skills such as verbal communication and people management skills. About me I identify the training needs of the legal and support staff at Fox Williams and respond by setting up in-house or external training for them. I have been in this role for 18 months and work in a small team of three which includes my boss, the HR and training director. Previously, I spent four years working at international law firm Allen &amp; Overy, as a training co-ordinator, for the company's banking division.
