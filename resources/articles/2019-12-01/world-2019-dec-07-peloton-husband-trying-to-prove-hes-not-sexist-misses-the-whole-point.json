He had a blast filming the commercial and, when the ad came out in November, his friends kindly told him it was great. But this week the ad went viral and poor Hunter\u2019s world started to fall apart. Twitter declared the ad Very Bad Indeed! People were mean about him on the internet and suggested the fictional husband he played was abusive. One of his own pals joked that Hunter had become a \u201csymbol of the patriarchy\u201d. Recounting his ordeal to Psychology Today, Hunter lamented that his \u201cfive seconds of air time created an array of malicious feedback that is all associated with my face\u201d. In order to distance himself from the commercial, Hunter changed his Instagram handle to pelotonhusband, For those of you haven\u2019t seen the ad yet: a woman gets Peloton\u2019s $2,400, Wifi-enabled exercise bike from her husband (Hunter) for Christmas. She starts a video diary of her sessions, and manages to give the unnerving impression that her husband will beat her or leave her if she doesn\u2019t wake up early every morning to exercise on her fancy bike. That\u2019s the precis, but I suggest you watch the ad for yourself because words can\u2019t do justice to how cringeworthy it is. Indeed, when I first saw it trending I assumed Peloton had made the ad awful on purpose so that it would go viral. The company is valued at several billion dollars, after all. Surely it knows what it\u2019s doing? And then I watched the \u201csexist and dystopian\u201d ad. It wasn\u2019t tongue-in-cheek terrible. It was terrible-terrible. Its attempts to portray getting on an exercise bike as some sort of life-changing spiritual journey inadvertently lifted a lid on the \u201cwellness\u201d industry, revealing it as an expensive scam. I started to understand why the company\u2019s stock had plunged and it had lost $1.5bn in value amid the Twitter backlash. I have some sympathy for the fact that Hunter\u2019s face is now associated with a viral ad the entire internet is dunking on. But it\u2019s also somewhat ironic that a man with five seconds of air time has set out to prove he isn\u2019t a \u201csymbol of the patriarchy\u201d by making the Peloton advert controversy entirely about him and bizarrely casting himself as a victim. Hunter could have spent five minutes thinking critically about why the ad was being called \u201csexist\u201d. Instead he whined that \u201cviewers can mistake an actor as that person after they\u2019ve seen them on television instead of a person given a script with no opinion on what they are being told to portray.\u201d Dude, I think people realize you were playing a fictional character and that you didn\u2019t write the script. He also sadly asked: \u201cIf recognized on the street, what will people\u2019s first opinions be of me?\u201d Hunter, mate, let me reassure you that by next week this ad, and your face, will be very old news. Montreal massacre finally acknowledged as a misogynistic attack Thirty years ago a gunman killed 14 young women in Montreal\u2019s \u00c9cole Polytechnique. It was the deadliest mass shooting in Canada\u2019s history and was very clearly an act of gender terrorism: the shooter told his victims he was \u201cfighting feminism\u201d and, in a suicide letter, blamed feminists for ruining his life. Despite his explicit misogyny, however, it wasn\u2019t until Thursday that the tragedy was officially described as an anti-feminist attack. On the eve of the 30th anniversary of the massacre, a new memorial plaque was unveiled condemning the \u201canti-feminist attack\u201d and \u201call forms of violence against women\u201d. Mike Pence\u2019s Aids hypocrisy It was World Aids Day last Sunday and the vice-president tweeted a message of solidarity.

Indian navy gets its first female pilot She\u2019s 24 years old and goes by one name only: Shivangi. more than 3,000 Uber sexual assaults last year Uber has released its first ever safety report and it makes for grim reading: more than 3,000 Uber America passengers reported sexual assaults in 2018. The fact that the ride-sharing company is making these numbers public is a step in the right direction. Lyft \u2013 which is facing a number of sexual assault lawsuits \u2013 would do well to follow suit. Cruise line sexual assault reports jump 67% There have been 35 alleged sexual assaults on cruise lines sailing from US ports in the third quarter of this year. This is an increase of 67% from Q3 2018, according to the US Department of Transportation. New Caledonia\u2019s snorkeling seniors A group of seven women, aged between 60 and 75, are helping scientists keep track of sea snakes in New Caledonia. The snorkeling seniors have been nicknamed the \u201cfantastic grandmothers\u201d and, according to the New York Times, their data collection \u201chas resulted in more detailed information on the ecology of greater sea snakes than is available for any other wide\u2010ranging sea snake worldwide\u201d. As one scientist noted, \u201cIf there is one thing I want everyone to learn from this, it\u2019s that you should never underestimate grandmothers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
