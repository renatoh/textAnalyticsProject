While the details of the new monitoring system have not been confirmed, official statements and leaked plans have indicated they could include mobile apps that track users\u2019 location, CCTV cameras with facial recognition software, QR codes, mobile phone data and credit card records. The hastily developed patchwork to monitor individuals\u2019 movements could tell authorities whether Russians had broken coronavirus lockdowns for reasons other than those allowed: seeking medical care, visiting the grocery store, the pharmacy, or traveling to an authorised job. Leaked plans indicate that parts of the system may go online this weekend. While there remain questions about whether the technology is viable, opposition politicians have warned that the government is laying the groundwork for a \u201ccybergulag,\u201d with a new system of enhanced surveillance that could remain active even after the current crisis passes. On Thursday, Vladimir Putin told Russians that he would extend the country\u2019s \u201cnon-working\u201d days, saying they should stay at home until the end of the month. On the same day, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, signed legislation that would allow city authorities to identify and fine people who had violated the shelter-at-home order. Supporters said that the law would maintain public safety during the coronavirus outbreak, while opponents said it gave the government dangerous powers. \u201cThere\u2019s no certainty that the system for surveilling Muscovites deployed during the pandemic will ever be rolled back,\u201d said Maxim Kruglov, a municipal deputy for the opposition Yabloko faction. Russian officials like Sobyanin and Mikhail Mishustin, the prime minister, have promised technological solutions to enforce a self-isolation regime that could last weeks or months. But despite unrivalled political control, there are doubts about whether the government has the resources and coordination to develop the kind of mass surveillance system that has emerged elsewhere, such as in China. Alexander Isavnin of the Internet Protection Society said that many of the controls being discussed, such as the sharing of users\u2019 mobile data, were difficult to implement and unconstitutional. More importantly, he said, the heavy-handed measures would evoke public anger among Russians. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a Chinese scenario is possible,\u201d said Isavnin, referring to that country\u2019s mass surveillance methods. \u201cPeople are going to react very poorly to [this technology]. They\u2019re probably going to find a way to sabotage it.\u201d One attempt has already sparked a backlash: a clumsy mobile application developed by Moscow\u2019s city government to monitor coronavirus patients\u2019 movements. The app, called Social Monitoring, was discovered last week in the Google Play store and requested access to a user\u2019s location, camera, telephone, sensors and other data to ensure they were complying with quarantine. Social Monitoring quickly disappeared from the online store. Eduard Lysenko, the head of Moscow\u2019s Department of Information Technologies, called the application a \u201ctest version\u201d released for professional feedback. It would be re-released, he said, and those opposed to installing the app on their phones could opt to receive a temporary device instead. Lysenko also said that Moscow is ready to roll out QR codes that would require Muscovites to register online and reapply each time they sought to leave the house. Citizens will be required to \u201cregister, fill out a simple form and a corresponding code will be generated, which can either be put on a telephone, sent by mail, or printed,\u201d he said. Those codes could then be checked by police officers and others with access to a central database. That system still has not been rolled out, amid concerns about enforcement and the lack of an official order from the Moscow mayor\u2019s office. For now, Moscow\u2019s quarantine has been lightly policed. That could soon change. Russian media leaked draft plans from the Moscow\u2019s mayor office to toughen enforcement of the quarantine beginning this weekend. The plans said the city would use cameras with facial recognition, banking data, QR codes, physical patrols on the streets and the social monitoring mobile application to keep tabs on people\u2019s movements. Russia\u2019s communications ministry has also said it plans to use mobile operator data to help enforce the self-isolation regime. The first time a person\u2019s phone leaves their permitted area, they will receive a text message, the agency said. \u201cIf the violations happen systematically, then the [mobile] operators will present the data to law enforcement.\u201d Russia\u2019s moves to strengthen surveillance measures mirror similar developments in other countries. On Thursday, Roskomsvoboda, a Russian NGO, released an interactive map to chart \u201cviolations of digital rights\u201d around the world as a result of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
