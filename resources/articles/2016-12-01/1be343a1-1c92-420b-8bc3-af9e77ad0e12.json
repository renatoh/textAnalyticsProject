The handwritten two-page letter, which Marshall posted to Instagram on Friday morning, addresses the fifth-year veteran as a \u201cworthless fucking nigger\u201d and a \u201cspoiled fucking jigaboo\u201d in addition to other racial epithets. The writer went on to tell Marshall \u201cyour time is coming, watch out\u201d and \u201cwe are \u2018channeling\u2019 a devastating hard hit for you. Something to make you an invalid in a wheel chair.\u201d Marshall knelt during the national anthem before the Broncos\u2019 season-opening game against the Carolina Panthers this year \u2013 a move that cost him an endorsement deal \u2013 in protest of racial oppression and police brutality in the United States. He continues to kneel during the anthem before the team\u2019s next seven games, but said in November he intended to stand for the rest of the season while looking to work for positive change. \u201cGoing forward, I will be standing for the national anthem \u2013 not because everything is perfect, or because I\u2019m changing my stance on things,\u201d Marshall said in an Instagram post. \u201cBut because of my hope for what we can become.\u201d The 27-year-old met with Denver\u2019s police chief in September and has donated $300 for every tackle he\u2019s made this season to charitable organizations in the community that are working toward ending social injustice. The news of Marshall\u2019s letter comes one day after New York Giants fullback Nikita Whitlock said that burglars left disturbing racist graffiti during a break-in on Tuesday at his New Jersey apartment, including a swastika, \u201cKKK\u201d and \u201cGo back to Africa\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
