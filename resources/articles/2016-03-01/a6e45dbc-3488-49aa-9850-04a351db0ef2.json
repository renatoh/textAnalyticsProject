Swansea\u2019s narrow win over Aston Villa, courtesy of Federico Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s scrappy goal,, and largely thanks to some suspect Brad Guzan goalkeeping, means they are all but safe from the threat of relegation but Williams made no attempt to try and sugarcoat a woeful display and a chaotic season. Garry Monk, Alan Curtis and Francesco Guidolin have taken charge of the team at various stages, which Williams said was \u201cnot ideal\u201d, and there will almost certainly be another managerial change in the summer. Yet there also needs to be a radical overhaul on the pitch. Swansea have badly lost their way and it is hard to think of many occasions when they have produced the sort of refined football with which they have become synonymous ever since winning promotion to the Premier League in 2011. Against Villa, the Premier League\u2019s bottom team, Swansea looked clueless at times. \u201cThis season\u2019s been a grind and today kind of summed it up a little bit. We didn\u2019t play very well but we managed to grind out a result,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s not been enjoyable, to be honest. There\u2019s been a lot of changes with the manager, it\u2019s not ideal. It\u2019s kind of one you want to get it out the way, get safe, see where you can finish and try and put everything right before next season and have another good season.\u201d Huw Jenkins, Swansea\u2019s chairman, intends to hold a summer review and Williams, a well-respected figure at the Liberty Stadium, said that he would be more than happy to offer his opinion if asked. \u201cI think this season is an important one, we\u2019ve got it wrong for whatever reason and it\u2019s unacceptable for a club like Swansea to have a season like this with the players that we\u2019ve got. It\u2019s such a good club, we need to do better next season, so there\u2019s a lot of talking to be done in the summer. \u201cThe pleasing thing is that it seems we\u2019ve got through it, we\u2019ve done what we had to do in certain games, like the Norwich game and against Villa, where we haven\u2019t played pretty but we\u2019ve got the points on the board. There are many reasons why [it has gone wrong], we will all have to do a lot of reflecting, look at ourselves, look at us as a squad, what\u2019s been going on \u2013 because there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s been going on. And we\u2019ll be looking for a better season next season.\u201d Man of the match Leon Britton (Swansea City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
