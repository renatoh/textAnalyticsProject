While this emphatic win will have restored some self-esteem following two Premier League defeats in Manchester and a nervous Champions League victory in Liege, the poverty of the opposition meant that some of the failings dogging Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team did not so much disappear as become an irrelevance. The attack was as profligate as ever, with Robin van Persie three times miscuing when he should have scored, while the defence fiddled and flapped and continued to look particularly vulnerable on crosses. In the end, however, none of this mattered since Arsenal found an alternative cure for at least one of these ills in Thomas Vermaelen. The Belgian was signed from Ajax to stiffen the defence but he spared the Emirates a frustrating afternoon by scoring the opening two goals, the first with a sharp downward header from Van Persie's inswinging corner, the second with a clinical half-volley following an exchange of passes with Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9. \"Let's be honest for once,\" said Wenger. \"I thought he would adapt quickly but not as quickly as that.\" Vermaelen is Arsenal's leading scorer, a statistic that they must hope will be short-lived given the number of chances the strikers are missing. Few if any of their opponents will let down their guard as regularly as Wigan did while offering a minimal attacking threat in reply. The win did not strengthen Arsenal's case for offering a more serious league challenge this time, it merely added one or two notes in the margins. Eduardo may yet forge a prolific partnership with Van Persie but until Nicklas Bendtner came off the bench the only significant presence in front of goal was Vermaelen. Cesc Fabregas helped the Gunners dominate in midfield, attempting 60 passes and completing the vast majority. His opposite number in the Wigan midfield attempted only a third of that number With a bit more nous and a modicum of effort Wigan might have caused Arsenal considerable embarrassment. As it was they achieved a few minutes of sustained pressure towards half-time which had Arsenal struggling to clear their lines and would have brought the scores level had Emmerson Boyce's firm header not been blocked by Vito Mannone, still keeping goal courtesy of Manuel Almunia's virus. Otherwise Wigan were so far below par that they practically became invisible. They gave away numerous free-kicks as much by blundering into opponents as deliberately fouling them. At times they appeared to be playing to the six-tackle rule. After all Wigan is a rugby league town. \"We were very poor in our performance,\" their manager, Roberto Mart\u00ednez, admitted. \"We did not get anywhere near the Arsenal players in the first half. Our starting position was wrong and there was a lack of belief. I can't take any positives from this performance \u2013 or the lack of it.\" One player who took more from the game was Ebou\u00e9, who left the field to loud applause when he was substituted after 73 minutes. He had made a competent rather than outstanding contribution, getting a touch to Eduardo's shot past Chris Kirkland for the third having been booked earlier for meeting the ball with a fist rather than his head, but there was more to it than that. When Arsenal met Wigan last December the Ivory Coast player, who was badly off form, had been booed mercilessly by the crowd. On Saturday the Emirates as good as said it was sorry. \"I believe Ebou\u00e9 did what you have to do in our job,\" said Wenger, \"which is to shut up, play and let everyone else talk while he produces quality performances. This is a strong job for strong people. The supporters are behind him when he plays well and plays with the right spirit.\" Ebou\u00e9 would appear to be more fortunate than Jon Sammels, a decent enough footballer in the 60s who could not please the Highbury crowd however well he played. Cesc F\u00e1bregas completed Arsenal's victory by turning in Bendtner's low cross. Wenger's players will have to work rather harder for success at Fulham this Saturday while Wigan can hardly be any worse at home to Chelsea. Can they? The breakdown Ars\u00e8ne Wenger Selection: Ebou\u00e9 and Clichy on the flanks, Eduardo and Van Persie roaming. Tactics: Fabregas the fulcrum as usual. Game-changing: Vermaelen's opening goal after 25 minutes. Suspensions: None Roberto Mart\u00ednez Selection: Gomez playing off Rodallega with midfield support. Tactics: Contain and counterattack which quickly became run and hide. Game-changing: Vermaelen's two goals. Suspensions: None Man of the match: Thomas Vermaelen (Arsenal) who took his goals with the aplomb of an established striker."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
