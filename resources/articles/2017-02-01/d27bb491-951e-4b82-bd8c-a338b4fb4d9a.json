He veered from topic to topic, demanding to know whether questions would be friendly and describing media reports about his links to Russia as both fake and the result of leaks. Here are the highlights. The Russian spy ship After one of the numerous attempts by reporters to get Trump to answer questions over his ties with Russia, the president \u2013 unprompted \u2013 brought up the possibility he could order an attack on a Russian spy ship in international waters off the US coast. But to do so, he said, would not be good for relations with Moscow. \u201cThe greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that\u2019s 30 miles offshore right out of the water. Everyone in this country\u2019s going to say \u2018oh, it\u2019s so great\u2019. That\u2019s not great. That\u2019s not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia.\u201d Michael Flynn Trump defended his former national security adviser\u2019s actions and said he thought Flynn had done nothing wrong. \u201cI don\u2019t think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right \u2026 But he didn\u2019t tell the vice-president of the United States the facts. And then he didn\u2019t remember. And that just wasn\u2019t acceptable to me.\u201d Leaks to the media At times Trump veered between somewhat contradictory positions. He said the leaks to the media that led to Flynn\u2019s resignation were \u201creal\u201d, but the articles reporting them amounted to \u201cfake news\u201d. Trump told one reporter: \u201cWell the leaks are real. You\u2019re the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.\u201d The media One of the themes Trump returned to again and again was what he called dishonesty in the media. Taking one example, he said the director of national intelligence had directly contradicted a Wall Street Journal article that reported security sources as saying some information was being kept from Trump to avoid it being leaked. Trump claimed no one had asked him for comment before publication. His office was quoted on the paper\u2019s front page. He also confirmed the veracity of other stories, which he simultaneously denounced. Trump also repeatedly made more general claims of fakery by news organisations, without backing them up with any specific complaints or facts. \u201cI won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn\u2019t win by people listening to you people. That\u2019s for sure,\u201d he told the reporters. \u201cTomorrow, they will say, \u2018Donald Trump rants and raves at the press\u2019. I\u2019m not ranting and raving. I\u2019m just telling you. You know, you\u2019re dishonest people. But I\u2019m not ranting and raving. I love this. I\u2019m having a good time doing it. \u201cBut tomorrow, the headlines are going to be \u2018Donald Trump rants and raves\u2019. I\u2019m not ranting and raving.\u201d CNN The US president attacked CNN in particular, claiming its on-air panels are \u201calmost exclusive anti-Trump\u201d. He said: \u201cI watch CNN, it\u2019s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred \u2026 The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN.\u201d BBC When the BBC\u2019s Jon Sopel got up to ask a question and identified himself, Trump \u2013 with a heavy hint of sarcasm \u2013 said: \u201cHere\u2019s another beauty.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a good line. Impartial, free and fair,\u201d Sopel replied. \u201cYeah. Sure. Just like CNN right?\u201d Trump shot back. Later, Sopel tweeted: \u201cMy bosses have approved a new business card for me: Jon Sopel, Another Beauty, North America Editor.\u201d Governance Trump sought to shift the blame over the blocking of his executive order on immigration. It was not, he insisted, the result of it being badly prepared by him and his staff, but of a poor judgment by the two separate courts that found against him. \u201cLet me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that\u2019s been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it\u2019s 80% of the time, a lot.\u201d Trump did not cite any evidence for that claim. Fact-checkers Snopes have found it to be false. \u201cWe had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect.\u201d Race and antisemitism Continuing his theme on the tone of the reporters, Trump accused a Jewish reporter of asking him a difficult question about recent instances of antisemitism in America, when, Trump claimed, he had promised to ask a \u201csimple, easy\u201d one. He angrily told the reporter to \u201csit down\u201d, adding: \u201cNumber one, I am the least antisemitic person you\u2019ve ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person.\u201d When the journalist tried to interject, Trump shouted over him: \u201cQuiet, quiet, quiet. See, he lied that he was going to get up and ask a straight, simple question, so, you know, welcome to the world of the media.\u201d Later, he insisted that antisemitic acts that have been reported were actually the work of anti-Trump activists. Again, he offered no evidence. Later, he asked April Ryan \u2013 a black journalist with American Urban Radio Networks \u2013 if she was friends with the Congressional Black Caucus. She had asked him if he would meet with the CBC. After asking for clarification on who the group was, Trump told her: \u201cWell, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting? Do you want to set up the meeting?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no, I\u2019m just a reporter,\u201d Ryan replied, before Trump pressed on: \u201cAre they friends of yours?\u201d Finally, he told her: \u201cI would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it\u2019s great, the Congressional Black Caucus, I think it\u2019s great.\u201d The electoral college Trump was picked up for inaccurately claiming to have scored the \u201cbiggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan\u201d at last year\u2019s election. Told by one reporter that he had done nothing of the sort (in fact George HW Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama all won more electoral college votes), Trump said: \u201cI\u2019m skipping that information, I don\u2019t know, I was just given \u2026 we had a very, very big margin.\u201d Pressed on why Americans should trust him when he gave them false information, he responded: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, I was given that information. I was given \u2013 I actually, I\u2019ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
