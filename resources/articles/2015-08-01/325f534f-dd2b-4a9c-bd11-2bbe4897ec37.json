In recent weeks Advocaat has declined repeated invitations to reiterate his commitment to the role, but the manager\u2019s mood was noticeably brighter on Friday. Asked if he would still be around when domestic football resumes on 12 September, after the international break, his reply was unequivocal:\u201c100%\u201d said Advocaat, who has made plain his displeasure at Short\u2019s new-found reluctance to invest in players worth \u00a310m or more. \u201cI never said that I will quit this club. I hope I can stay until the end of the season. Honestly. This is a great club, I really mean that. I have been at many great clubs but this is a really special one.\u201d Perhaps instructively, he refused to answer an inquiry as to whether he had considered quitting in recent weeks before revealing he had been involved in constructive talks with \u201cour president [Short]\u201d. \u201cI am happier now,\u201d the Dutchman said. \u201cI have had a good talk with the president and also the players this week. The team will be there for me. We did it last year [avoid relegation] and we will do the same again. That is the feeling I have now \u2013 and we know how to do it with the players.\u201d If it seems a watershed was reached in the past couple of days, an alternative explanation is that Advocaat\u2019s earlier unhappiness was all part of a game of brinkmanship intended to put pressure on Short to improve the squad. Indeed as a briefing intended to preview Saturday\u2019s game at Aston Villa \u2013 where Sunderland will attempt to secure their first Premier League win of the season \u2013 drew towards a conclusion, the former Holland manager answered the question he had earlier made a point of avoiding. \u201cI was never thinking of leaving this club, honestly,\u201d he said, unprompted. \u201cWe took the decision to do it and I would never leave this club now. Everybody knew inside the club I would never go. I have a really great feeling with this club.\u201d It all seemed radically different from Monday when a disgruntled Advocaat confronted the media clutching a piece of paper with the felt-tipped words \u201cDon\u2019t laugh\u201d written in Dutch. When, helpfully, he translated this memo for reporters it seemed a not-so-subtle message to Short, but on Friday an alternative explanation was offered. \u201cLast week you wrote about me not laughing, and I have to explain why,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a tooth out [broken]. If I laugh, you see it [the gap], and that was the reason. It was nothing to do with my mood. I broke the tooth eating some candy. Next week I go to the dentist in Holland.\u201d Whatever rapprochement has been reached behind the scenes is unlikely to have been prompted entirely by Sunderland\u2019s latest signing. Although Ola Toivonen\u2019s arrival was welcomed by Advocaat, the recruitment of the Sweden attacking midfielder on loan from Rennes is not quite the kind of high-calibre acquisition he envisaged. Yet after this week\u2019s talks Advocaat exhibited greater sympathy for Short\u2019s new-found caution, claiming certain predecessors in the manager\u2019s chair had \u201cnot cared for the club\u201d by buying sub-standard players on vastly inflated wages. \u201cI totally understand the owner because he has spent so much over the last few years and has seen nothing back, only playing for relegation every year,\u201d said the manager. \u201cA lot of players \u2013 not one or two or three, much more \u2013 he\u2019s still paying for and they\u2019re not even here any more. That\u2019s not good for the club and I can understand a bit of the suspicion. \u201cSpending a lot is not a problem for the owner if you see it [results] on the pitch. Over the last couple of years he didn\u2019t see it on the pitch. I think that man is willing to do the best for this club. I really mean that - but if you see nothing back you become a little bit suspicious.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
