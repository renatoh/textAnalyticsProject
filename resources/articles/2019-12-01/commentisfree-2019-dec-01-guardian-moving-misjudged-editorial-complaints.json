Many readers think that the unsigned opinion, supported by the masthead, is the result of a systematic and deliberative process, and that the editorial is the considered view, if not of the owner, then of the editor. An editorial in any paper can be perceived as a corporate or institutional view. It is not necessarily a collective or representative one. Consciously or not, editorials, also known as leaders, are a way newspapers assert identity, attempt overt influence, and differentiate themselves in the marketplace, especially at election times. So, if the editorial process goes wrong \u2013 as it did for the Guardian recently over a leader occasioned by a former UK prime minister David Cameron\u2019s memoir \u2013 and the editor-in-chief apologises and promises measures to prevent a recurrence, readers can legitimately enquire further. I asked the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, what changes she had instituted. For example, how many people, and of what seniority, would determine the Guardian view for any given leader, and see the draft before publication? Would she sign them all off personally, and, if not, how senior would be those delegated to sign them off on her behalf? She responded: \u201cI realise that many people think that the editor writes all the leaders/editorials. At some smaller news organisations that might still be the case, but at the Guardian it has not been true for many years.\u201d Viner pointed out that the Guardian has an international news website with 163m browsers monthly, print and other digital products, and hundreds of staff around the globe. \u201cOur editorials are written by a team of colleagues, who agree themes and lines with me in advance; the articles then pass through a thorough editing and production process. This system has worked well on weekdays, but on that particular Sunday the subject matter was highly inappropriate and through a series of errors it was not shown to senior enough colleagues,\u201d Viner emailed. \u201cTo correct this, we have tightened up editorial processes on a Sunday and all leaders are now seen before publication online by either the deputy editor or me.\u201d Process-wise, I don\u2019t think she could do more. Such an incident with an editorial is rare, though not unique, in Guardian history. In 1896, an editorial mentioned a rumour that the recently defeated prime minister, Lord Rosebery, had traded peerages for party donations. Viner\u2019s greatest predecessor, CP Scott, wrote to him to say \u201chow much I regret the passage in Friday\u2019s leader \u2026 It ought of course to have been struck out. But the leader was extremely late and the revision unfortunately imperfect \u2026 Please don\u2019t think of acknowledging this note, which I am afraid I am writing selfishly for the relief of my feelings.\u201d But Rosebery did acknowledge, with what seems, at this distance, a sort of grim glee: \u201cMy Dear Mr Scott, the allusion in the Guardian requires no explanation. I rejoiced in it, for it gave me the opportunity that I had long desired of pulverising this lie, to which [a political rival] \u2026 had given circulation. It is amusing to see how the squirters of this filth are now declaring that they never said or intended or thought anything of the sort.\u201d \u2022 Paul Chadwick is the Guardian\u2019s readers\u2019 editor"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
