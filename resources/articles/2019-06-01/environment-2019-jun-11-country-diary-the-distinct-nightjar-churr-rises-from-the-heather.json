Tall pines surround the edge of the heathland, making it feel like a large arena, amplifying every noise within its walls. All around, song thrushes, blackbirds, robins, chaffinches and a chiffchaff sing at full voice. The thin whistles of siskins carry from the pine tops. Bees and other pollinating insects zip from one heather plant to the next. There are two other birds singing somewhere on the heath \u2013 Dartford warblers. Their songs consist of short phrases of scratchy warbling. One is nearer, and the other, more distant one is answering. I look for the birds through binoculars, watching for movement on the bushes and trees. I finally find the nearest one in a silver birch. It\u2019s moving restlessly from branch to branch, partly hidden by the green leaves, only stopping to sing. It rests near the top of the tree, flicking its long tail up and down, and I can see its dark grey head, its claret breast and face, and angry red-rimmed eyes. Harsh winters had reduced the numbers of Dartford warblers on these Sussex heaths, but it\u2019s good to see them returning. As the sun drops towards the trees, the sky begins to cloud over. Little white moths are fluttering above the heather. To my surprise, the unmistakeable \u201cchurr\u201d of a nightjar rises from the vegetation near my feet. It\u2019s not long past 8pm \u2013 at least an hour before I\u2019d expect to hear nightjars begin to churr, in a sort of warm-up before the full performance later on. I stand completely still and listen. The bird must be no more than five metres away and yet I can\u2019t see it among the dense heather. I listen to its otherworldly song \u2013 a continuous soft trill, occasionally changing tone, as the bird breathes in and out. It stops. I linger until darkness begins to fall. Sure enough, more nightjars begin to churr. Two \u201cku-ick\u201d calls announce the first flying nightjars of the night. A male passes over my head, clapping its wings over its back in display, and flashing the white spots on its wingtips. It chases another nightjar \u2013 the absence of white spots means it\u2019s a female \u2013 and together the two birds drop down into the heather."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
