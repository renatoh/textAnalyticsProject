Plus, I realised I know little about the heyday of Batman and co, and spent a lot of time reading of how Stan Lee employed his characters as morale-boosting agents in the cold war. Fascinating stuff. I hope this week's theme, songs about suburbia, proves as absorbing. Much as I enjoyed listening to them, theme tunes and songs composed for the soundtracks of animated films didn't seem right for the playlists. No room, then, for Peggy Lee's We Are Siamese, Link Wray's take on the Batman theme or Louis Prima's priceless I Wanna Be Like You (ooh ooh). Danger Doom's The Mask and Last Emperor's excellent Secret Wars Part 1, an entire comic in hip-hop form, both fought hard for a place on the A-list, but were ultimately demoted. They take their place on the B-list alongside Bloodhound Gang's deliciously warped Ralph Wiggum, Queen's Flash, the Hollywood Argyles' Alley Oop, Suicide's sultry Cheree, Crash Test Dummies' Superman's Song, Herbaliser's Verbal Anime, Miles Davis's Someday My Prince Will Come and Jeffrey Lewis's charming When I Was Four. Conspicuous by its absence from both lists is the Flaming Lips' wondrous Waitin' for a Superman: it was on the heroes B-list a few weeks ago. This week's thanks, as you may have guessed from the mention of YouTube, are chiefly for links: cheers to nilpferd for Dough for the Do-Do, a prime example of surrealist art, to ShivSidecar for Krazy Kat at the Circus, and to debbym for All the Cats Join In, with a splendid score by Benny Goodman. Back to real life, and this week's theme \u2013 suburbia. I'm expecting this one to dredge up a few rotten memories for me: I spent my teenage years stuck in the outskirts of London, relying on commuter trains to get me in and out of town. Apologies to anyone who lives in the suburbs and loves it: it simply wasn't me. That said, I promise to try hard to give equal listening time to songs that celebrate suburbia and those that malign it. Deadline as usual is midday Monday; no post should contain more than one-third of a song's lyrics. The A-Z and RR archive can tell you if a song has been playlisted before, and there's more fun to be had at the Overspill blog."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
