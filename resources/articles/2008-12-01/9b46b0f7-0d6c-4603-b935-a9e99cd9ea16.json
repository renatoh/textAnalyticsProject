Bullard, who joined Fulham from Wigan in May 2006 for a fee of \u00a32.5m, is believed to be a target for two Lancashire clubs, and both Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers will be watching developments at Craven Cottage with interest. A testy Hodgson said today that negotiations on Bullard's contract are ongoing. \"We're not trying to get rid of Jimmy Bullard. But Jimmy Bullard is trying to get a contract which suits him. He's not sure we can provide that contract which suits him and as a result we have to be realistic and there might be clubs out there who can offer him that and who can match the transfer fee that we think he's worth,\" said Hodgson, who added that Alistair Mackintosh, the club's chief executive, was negotiating with Bullard and his agent. \"I have made it clear to the club where I see the player in our plans and I am fully aware that every club works within certain remits and let's hope they find a solution,\" the Fulham manager said. \"We will have to wait and see what the solution is. With the January transfer window coming up we cannot rule out, of course, that if the club at the moment are not satisfying him and telling him the things he wants to hear, that there might be other clubs coming in and attempting to sign him.\" Another Fulham player who is the subject of festive transfer rumours is the Norwegian defender Brede Hangeland. Hodgson said the club had no intention of selling the 27-year-old centre-half. \"Hangeland is not on the transfer list \u2014 none of our players are actively up for sale. The simple facts are that he is a Fulham player and I sincerely hope he continues to be a Fulham player and we have had no offers for the player from anybody.\" Hodgson said he had spoken to John Paintsil after he theatrically tried to have Ricardo Fuller sent off after a slight brush of heads. \"I didn't like it. We have spoken about it. The action is internal,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
