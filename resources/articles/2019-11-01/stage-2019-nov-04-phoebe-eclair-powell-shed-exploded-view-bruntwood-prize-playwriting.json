Parker\u2019s installation presented the contents of a shed blown apart by the British army and frozen as if mid-explosion. Eclair-Powell\u2019s starkly violent play, Shed: Exploded View, which borrows the subheader of Parker\u2019s 1991 artwork, is described by the playwright as \u201can explosion in action\u201d. The play opens with fireworks and a New Year\u2019s Eve marriage proposal. Or rather, that is the first scene presented in the script, but Eclair-Powell states: \u201cThis is one order in which the scenes can work. The scenes each have titles, so that, if the director and actors wanted to, they could reorder the scenes to fit their production.\u201d The play spans 30 years in the lives of three couples and comprises many short scenes that keep the audience guessing about the connections between characters and how the stories fit together. Eclair-Powell receives \u00a316,000 in prize money and will develop the script with Manchester\u2019s Royal Exchange theatre, where the awards ceremony was held on Monday. Bryony Shanahan, recently appointed joint artistic director at the Royal Exchange and one of the judges for the prize, said the shortlisted plays had \u201ckept us debating for hours\u201d. She described Shed: Exploded View as \u201cprecise and considered, a beautiful tapestry of ideas meticulously woven together, but also astonishingly emotional\u201d. The play, she said, \u201cdeals with themes of female trauma with dignity, offering hope to her characters and the audience along the way\u201d. Eclair-Powell, the daughter of comedian Jenny Eclair, has written several plays including Fury, an updated take on Medea; Torch, which she described as a \u201ccelebration of womanhood\u201d; and Epic Love and Pop Songs, a piece of gig-theatre about teenage friendship featuring tracks by Patti Smith and Miley Cyrus. Shed: Exploded View is the overall winner of the Bruntwood prize. The judges award went to Glee &amp; Me by Stuart Slade; the \u201coriginal new voice\u201d award for debut writers was won by Michael John O\u2019Neill for his play Akedah; and the international award went to New York-based writer Kimber Lee for the strikingly named Untitled F*ck Miss Sa*gon Play (Srsly This Is Not the Title), which addresses Asian stereotypes in the US entertainment industry. There were 2,561 entries to the 2019 Bruntwood prize \u2013 the highest number of submissions to date for the biennial prize and a 35% increase in entries from 2017. The jury was chaired by the Young Vic\u2019s artistic director, Kwame Kwei-Armah. Former prizewinner Anna Jordan and the Guardian journalist Bridget Minamore were among the jurors. Minamore said that Shed: Exploded View \u201cplays with form, but not in a way that feels pretentious or gratuitous. Its stage directions claim the scenes could work in any order, so, as soon as I had read it from beginning to end, I read the scenes again, but backwards, and that\u2019s when I had a feeling we\u2019d found the winner. It\u2019s such an ambitious and painful exploration of domestic violence and gender and family, and the precision and subtlety in the language really struck me. \u201cOverall, I was surprised most by how many stories on the shortlist I knew would immediately have an audience if they were staged tomorrow.\u201d Other previous winners of the Bruntwood prize include Katherine Soper and Duncan Macmillan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
