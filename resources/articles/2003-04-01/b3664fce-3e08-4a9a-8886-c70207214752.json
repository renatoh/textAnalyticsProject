Getting on for half a century ago, he took me to Meadow Lane to see my first football match. Notts, then in the old Second Division, beat Bristol Rovers 3-0 that day. Though I can't tell you who scored, I remember being impressed by a twinkle-footed winger called Don Roby and a composed inside-forward named Ron Wylie, who became the first object of my lifelong admiration for creative midfielders. The next time I was taken to a match it involved Nottingham Forest, and after one look at Billy Walker's FA Cup-winning team, Forest were my club. But my dad continued to watch Notts every now and then, along with a couple of men from our village, whose sense of humour was of the mordant variety that I came to recognise as being particular to Nottinghamshire, and which was at its most pronounced on Meadow Lane's weed- infested terracing. One club was going up as the other was going down, which might have had something to do with my own pledge of allegiance. But a fondness for Notts, and for their ground, situated next door to the local abattoir, was easy to maintain. When the City Ground's main stand burnt down during a match against Leeds in 1968, Forest played the next half-dozen home matches at Meadow Lane, where we sheltered at the Kop end under an old wooden grandstand which had been bought from Trent Bridge cricket ground and floated over the river on a barge many years earlier. By then Notts were in the Fourth Division, and they have been going up and down ever since. The flavour of the club is brilliantly captured in a recently published memoir called Steak... Diana Ross by the Times journalist David McVay, who played for them in the mid-70s as a teenage midfielder and writes amusingly of the days when younger first-team players still took the bus to training and an ability to sink pints was still the measure of a footballer's manhood. It was always said in Nottingham that County were potentially a bigger club than Forest, and that time would provide the proof. When Jimmy Sirrel and Howard Wilkinson finally got them into the old First Division, however, it rapidly became apparent that most of their old support had died off. The club's natural constituency had shrunk to about half that of their neighbours. And now, a decade after Neil Warnock gave them one last, brief fling in the top flight, Notts County are in danger of disappearing. The FA has said that if they cannot extricate themselves from financial administration by the end of May, the club will have to close down. All they need to avert the impending catastrophe is someone with \u00a34m to spare - about \u00a33m to buy the club from the administrator and another million to prove to the local council that the present running costs can be met. The usual remedies have been tried, from altruistic local businessmen to foreigners bearing promises of the sort of backing guaranteed to take the club straight into the Champions League. But although the city council is offering a modified lease that would enable a new owner to make some money by developing part of the land surrounding the ground, the prospects are not promising. Would it matter much if Notts County disappeared? After all, it would certainly have surprised the group of citizens who met in the George IV hotel one day in 1864 if someone had told them that the organisation they were founding would turn out to have a lifespan of almost 140 years. So maybe the club made its only indelible mark on football history when its black and white shirts were taken on by the fledgling Juventus back in 1903. And for most people in Nottingham there's probably something better to do on a Saturday afternoon than turn up at Meadow Lane for a good moan. But I can tell you, for what it's worth, that it would matter to me."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
