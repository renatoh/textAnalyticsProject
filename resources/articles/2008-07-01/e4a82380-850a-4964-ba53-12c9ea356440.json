Having guided the Blues to fifth in the Premier League last season, the Scot has yet to bring in any new faces so far this summer. A central midfielder remains a priority after Lee Carsley's departure for Birmingham. But Moyes has revealed he wants five more additions before the end of August: \"I think we'll be working right up until the window closes like everyone else. We need to bring in probably five or six players and we haven't brought any in yet. We need to be quite busy in the coming weeks. We're missing bodies and we've got injured players not available. Our numbers are so short and we've got injuries, too.\" Moyes, who dismissed talk of Andy Johnson leaving as \"speculation\", was able to welcome back Mikel Arteta against the Conference club Cambridge United, the Spanish midfielder coming off the bench for the final 15 minutes as he works his way back from a persistent groin problem. \"It was good to have Mikel back but we can see he's got a lot to do yet,\" said Moyes. \"Hopefully he'll be better with 15 minutes behind him and we hope that that problem is behind him.\" Arteta's return was a rare highlight after Everton were a goal down through Andy Parkinson inside half a minute. Lukas Jutkiewicz's double put the Blues in front but Parkinson levelled and goals from Robbie Willmott and Mark Beesley sealed a shock win. Everton's director, Keith Wyness, confirmed the team's interest in the Sporting Lisbon midfielder Joao Moutinho. The 21-year-old was man of the match in Portugal's opening game of Euro 2008 and had been linked to Chelsea, having played under Luiz Felipe Scolari, until their chief executive, Peter Kenyon, said: \"Chelsea are not interested in this player.\" Sporting Lisbon value Moutinho at about \u00a316m and Everton are considering a bid. \"The arrival of Joao Moutinho is a big possibility for us,\" Wyness said.
