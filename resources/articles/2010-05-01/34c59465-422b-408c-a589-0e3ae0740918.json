Forming a government in a hung parliament takes time. Agreeing to hold talks, negotiating, reporting back, signing off \u2013 all these things take days, not hours, especially when alternative coalitions have to be examined and tested. As it happens, Britain's political parties have done their May 2010 deal in a relatively short period \u2013 a little under five days since the election result was known. Compared with other jurisdictions, this is business briskly done. Scotland's three coalitions since 1999 have required six, 13 and 12 days, while Wales's 2007 formation took fully two months. In New Zealand in 1996, after the country's first proportional representation election, the political parties took eight weeks to strike a deal. And in the US, 11 weeks always pass between a presidential election and inauguration day. The past few days have been good political theatre and good for talking heads on College Green, as well as the stuff of future theses. But the whole novel process has passed without any air of crisis. Most of those involved appeared, in public at least, to behave very reasonably. Government of a sort has continued, even to the extent that the chancellor participated, fully and legitimately, in important talks on the eurozone's crisis. The idea that the markets would be reduced to hysteria by the process of government-forming has proved to be wholly fallacious. The Cassandras who prophesied doom and confusion got the situation wrong, from beginning to end. Memo to the future: from the vantage point of the transition process of 2010, the following thoughts may prove useful. Britain's system was challenged but not overwhelmed by a hung election. The process went well, largely because the civil service had given prior thought to how it would react, and because the parties responded in a very practical way to resolve the situation. There would, though, be great merit in trying to formalise the post-election period so the whole process is even better insulated against media and market pressure. Britain should learn from countries like Australia and Canada which have a phased post-election handover, with the outgoing government remaining in power in a caretaker capacity for a period of perhaps a week, while the necessary preparations and discussions take place. As the Institute for Government concluded in a report on transitions last year, \"there are advantages in a phased handover over a few days, or even a week, as opposed to the adrenaline and urgency of an overnight change\". The events of May 2010 have more than vindicated that judgment. A sensible transition between governments should now be written into law."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
