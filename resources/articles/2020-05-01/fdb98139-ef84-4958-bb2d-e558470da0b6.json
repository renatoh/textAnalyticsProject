At an online \u2018virtual\u2019 commencement ceremony for HBCUs this afternoon, the former US president ripped his successor\u2019s actions on the pandemic, saying: \u201cMore than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing. A lot of them aren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge.\u201d Justin Amash will not run as third-party candidate for president. The former Republican said he will not run as a third-party candidate in this year\u2019s presidential election, assuaging fears among Democrats that he would help return Trump to power in this November\u2019s election. New York tourist arrested in Hawaii for violating local quarantine rule. The island state, with 638 Covid-19 cases, has been cracking down on those who refuse to comply with the 14-day mandated isolation. US states begin to reopen amid contact tracing programs scramble. Patchwork of efforts as states left to devise own programs and local health department are still hiring people to test and trace contacts. Barack Obama delivered a rare rebuke of a sitting president from one of his predecessors on Saturday when he criticized the Trump administration\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic during an online commencement address to graduates of 78 historically black colleges and universities. A just-published story from my colleague Jessica Glenza has further details. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, a disease like this just spotlights the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe see it in the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on our communities.\u201d As he continued, Obama criticized federal response efforts to the pandemic: \u201cMore than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing. A lot of them aren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge,\u201d he said. The speech was the first of two addresses Obama was due to give on Saturday. He is also scheduled to take part in a prime time special for high-school graduates that starts at 8pm Eastern on all the major TV networks. The White House says Donald Trump\u2019s latest firing of a federal watchdog came following a recommendation by US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. \u201cSecretary Pompeo recommended the move, and President Trump agreed,\u201d an administration official said on Saturday after two top Democrats announced a probe into Trump\u2019s dismissal of Steve Linick, the state department\u2019s inspector general, on Friday night. New York representative Eliot Engel and New Jersey senator Bob Menendez said the decision \u201cmay be an illegal act of retaliation\u201d in letters to the White House, the state department and the inspector general\u2019s office announcing the investigation, asking that administration officials provide all records related to the firing to the committees by Friday, according to the AP. The results of more than 35,000 Covid-19 tests ordered by a Florida-based health care system and performed by a third-party lab are unreliable, the company said Saturday. The Associated Press reports: According to AdventHealth, a faith-based health care system, the situation has created unacceptable delays. AdventHealth didnt name the third-party lab but said it had terminated its contract with the lab. The tests were a mixture of positive and negative results, and some had been at the lab for a while. About 25,000 of the unreliable tests were in the central Florida area. AdventHealth president and CEO Terry Shaw said the company will notify patients who are impacted. AdventHealth has 49 hospitals in nine states. Company spokeswoman Melanie Lawhorn said two of those states are joint venture systems and were not affected by the unreliable testing. On Saturday, Florida\u2019s department of health reported more than 600 new coronavirus cases in the past 24-hour period, lifting the overall count to 44,811. A total of 1,964 people have died from the virus, up 47 from Friday. US swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin helped bring Donald Trump to power in 2016. How they handle the pandemic may well be crucial at the presidential election this November too, writes my colleague David Smith. Just as in the 2016, the swing states bring national trends into sharp focus. Democratic governors across the country have generally urged caution, particularly in major cities, citing concerns for public health from a virus that has killed more than 85,000 people in the US \u2013 more than any other country in the world. But Republican governors have tended to err on the side of reopening faster, alarmed that more than 36m Americans have submitted unemployment claims since mid-March and retail sales dipped 16.4% last month. Southern states such as Georgia and Texas were among the first to allow shops and businesses to reopen. \u201cVaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back,\u201d Trump said in the White House rose garden on Friday while announcing a major US drive to create a coronavirus vaccine. Polls show Biden beating Trump in battleground states but Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, warns that he still faces political traps. \u201cThe fundamental problem for the Democratic party is that in order to defeat Trump, they almost have to cheerlead for a bad economy and they also have to cheerlead for new [coronavirus] hotspots in swing states. It sounds gruesome, but really that\u2019s so far what they\u2019re banking on to beat Trump. \u201cAnd in this case, Trump is absolutely smarter than that and what he is offering, not only his base but voters in swing states, is hope. It\u2019d actually be reminiscent, in a much less articulate way, of Ronald Reagan. He\u2019s basically saying, \u2018I got you to the promised land economically once, I will get you back to the promised land economically again\u2019. Barack Obama also commented in his virtual commencement address just now on the cold-blood shooting of Ahmaud Arbery that has sparked widespread horror and outrage. Arbery, a black man shot and killed while jogging in Georgia by a white former police officer and his son, was 25. After he was killed, it took local authorities more than two months to file charges, a move that followed shocking video footage of the shooting emerging into the public domain. Obama made the comments at a virtual commencement ceremony for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, as he acknowledged the dual crises graduates now face after leaving college \u2013 the Covid-19 pandemic and a historic economic downturn. Let\u2019s be honest, a disease like this just spotlights the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country... We see it in the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on our communities,\u201d said Obama. \u201cJust as we see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him, if he doesn\u2019t submit to their questioning. Injustice like this isn\u2019t new.\u201d At an online \u201cvirtual\u201d commencement ceremony for Historically Black College and Universities this afternoon, the former US president, Barack Obama, told graduates moments ago about his successor administration\u2019s actions on the pandemic: More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing. A lot of them aren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge.\u201d The takedown of the Trump administration\u2019s response to the pandemic is a rare rebuke from a former president. It follows Obama\u2019s leaked remarks last week that the government response to Covid-19 had been \u201can absolute chaotic disaster\u201d. But Saturday\u2019s remarks were made openly to likely thousands of graduating students tuned in online. While a majority of North American thoroughbred tracks have been shuttered during the pandemic, Churchill Downs and Santa Anita Park resumed live racing on Saturday in what the Associated Press says could be a lifeline for owners and trainers with smaller barns who have been suffering without steady income. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, hopefully,\u201d Maryland-based owner and trainer Linda Gaudet said from Kentucky, where she\u2019s preparing for racing to return Saturday at Churchill Downs. \u201cThe owners and the trainers and the riders, they need to get back to work, make a living.\u201d A mix of government restrictions and positive Covid-19 results stopped racing in Kentucky, Maryland, New York, California and elsewhere in March, and Gaudet said \u201cit\u2019s been a long two months.\u201d Racing without fans continued only at a handful of tracks, including Florida\u2019s Gulfstream Park and Tampa Bay Downs and Arkansas\u2019 Oaklawn Park. Trainer Norm Casse recently said from Florida that as long as some tracks are running, he\u2019s able to keep his operation going. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s probably an industry in the country that\u2019s not affected by this in some way, shape or form,\u201d Norm Casse said. \u201cYou take comfort in the fact that you know you\u2019re not alone, that everybody\u2019s going to be making sacrifices. Everybody probably stands to lose a little something from all of this and just be grateful to be in the position we were in to begin with.\u201d Some are in better position than others. Deep-pocketed owners and big-time trainers like two-time Triple Crown winner Bob Baffert can handle the reduction in racing. It\u2019s more concerning for the small businesses throughout the industry, from owners and trainers to jockeys, grooms and other employees. \u201cThose businesses don\u2019t have the financial flexibility, perhaps the cash reserves, to weather this storm for longer than a month or two,\u201d National Thoroughbred Racing Association president and CEO Alex Waldrop said. \u201cIf this extends past May into June or July, you\u2019re going to see attrition. You\u2019re going to see people who aren\u2019t going to be able to remain viable business operations.\u201d Congressmen announces examination of watchdog firing by Trump Representative Eliot Engel of New York, a Democrat and the chairman of the House foreign affairs committee (as well as a leading figure in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump at the start of the year), announced that the committee would be probing the firing last night of the State Department inspector general, Steve Linick. In a statement, Engel said: \u201cThis firing is the outrageous act of a president trying to protect one of his most loyal supporters, the Secretary of State, from accountability. I have learned that the Office of the Inspector General had opened an investigation into Secretary Pompeo. Mr. Linick\u2019s firing amid such a probe strongly suggests that this is an unlawful act of retaliation. \u201cThis president believes he is above the law. As he systematically removes the official independent watchdogs from the Executive Branch, the work of the Committee on Foreign Affairs becomes that much more critical. In the days ahead, I will be looking into this matter in greater detail, and I will press the State Department for answers. \u201cI thank Mr. Linick for his distinguished service.\u201d The US House foreign relations committee has just announced an investigation into the firing last night of Donald Trump\u2019s inspector general at the State Department, Reuters reports. Steve Linick was ousted last night as the department\u2019s internal watchdog. He had been reportedly looking into the actions of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. According to a Democratic congressional aide, just before his abrupt dismissal Linick had opened an investigation into allegations that Pompeo had been using a political appointee at the state department to run personal errands for him and his wife, Susan. More details as they emerge. Justin Amash has announced that he will not run as a third-party candidate in this year\u2019s presidential election. Some had feared the former Republican\u2019s campaign would help return Donald Trump to power in this November\u2019s election, an accusation Amash denied. \u201cWashington is totally dysfunctional,\u201d Amash told CNN\u2019s State of the Union earlier this month. \u201cThat\u2019s why I left the Republican party, because there was this partisan death spiral. \u201cWe need someone who\u2019s going to come in as president, respect our constitution, defend our rights, and fix our representative system of government so that people will actually feel represented at home. And I know that millions of Americans want that.\u201d On Saturday, he said he had reconsidered his decision. \u201cAfter much reflection, I\u2019ve concluded that circumstances don\u2019t lend themselves to my success as a candidate for president this year, and therefore I will not be a candidate,\u201d the Michigan congressman tweeted. \u201cI\u2019ve spent nearly three weeks assessing the race, appearing in media, talking to delegates and donors, watching the Libertarian Party\u2019s convention plan unfold, and gathering feedback from family, friends, and other advisers,\u201d he added. Amash was the first Republican congressman to call for the impeachment of Donald Trump. Barack Obama is due to make a speech today during an online commencement for HBCUs. You can follow the speech here on a livestream. David Smith has detailed Donald Trump\u2019s obsession with his predecessor. As David puts it: \u201cObservers point to a mix of anti-intellectualism, racism, vengeance and primitive envy over everything from Obama\u2019s Nobel peace prize to the scale of his inauguration crowd and social media following.\u201d You can read the full article below: New Orleans is making its first steps towards reopening today. Cafes, restaurants and nail salons can serve customers but only those who have made reservations. Casinos, concert venues and bars are still closed, however, and people are still recommended to stay home when possible. Louisiana has been badly affected by Covid-19 with 2,448 deaths recorded so far. However, fatalities have been falling for some time, prompting the partial reopening. New Jersey, the state with the second most deaths from Covid-19 in the US, has reported some (relatively) positive news. In Saturday\u2019s press briefing Governor Phil Murphy said hospitalization, ICU occupancy and ventilation rates were all down \u201cdramatically\u201d over the last few weeks. However, on a more sobering note, he pointed out that more than 10,000 people have died from Covid-19 in New Jersey since the start of the pandemic. Only New York has reported more deaths. \u201cWe cannot let those we have lost ever just become a statistic,\u201d wrote Murphy on Twitter. \u201cThey were real people, with real families, and with tremendous stories.\u201d He also said that $2.8m has been allocated to mental health services during the pandemic. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has announced an increase to the country\u2019s child benefit, which was introduced four years ago, to help families struggling because of the pandemic. \u201cTo all the moms and dads out there: This means that your monthly CCB payments will go up this July to help you pay for things like food, clothes, and activities you and your family can do together at home. And next week, you\u2019ll get an extra one-time payment of $300 per child,\u201d Trudeau wrote on Twitter. \u201cYou should be able to focus on what matters most right now: raising your kids and keeping your family healthy. And by increasing your monthly CCB payments, we\u2019re making sure that\u2019s exactly what you can do,\u201d he added. Canada\u2019s death toll has increased to 5,595, up from 5,499, as the country\u2019s number of confirmed coronavirus infections has risen to 74,993 from 73,818, according to Reuters. Los Angeles has become the first major US city to allow anyone with or without symptoms to be tested for Covid-19 as often as they want. \u201cSo long as COVID-19 spreads, we have to scale up our response \u2013 and because this disease can be a silent killer, we have carefully built the capacity to get more people tested,\u201d LA mayor Eric Garcetti said. \u201cNo one should have to wait, wonder, or risk infecting others. Don\u2019t leave it to chance. Schedule a test.\u201d The AP reports: A website to book a test was quickly swamped by residents in the nation\u2019s second-largest city and the surrounding county who couldn\u2019t get tested under more stringent guidelines and were concerned they were infected or could be asymptomatic carriers unwittingly exposing others. But despite overbooking to compensate for a third of the people who didn\u2019t show up, the city still has thousands of tests that aren\u2019t being used each week, according to figures provided to the Associated Press by the mayor\u2019s office. \u201cWasted tests at a time when we still have insufficient testing is really unfortunate,\u201d said Dr Eric Topol, head of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, a San Diego-based medical research partnership. \u201cI applaud what they\u2019re doing. The more people tested the better.\u201d Mayor Eric Garcetti\u2019s vow to not let a test go to waste was the result of a partnership with a start-up company that developed an easy-to-administer test that doesn\u2019t rely on scarce supplies. But it was a significant departure from stricter state criteria and guidelines set by the health department the city shares with the county to limit tests to those who need them most. It comes at a time when expanded testing is a cornerstone of the state\u2019s plan to ease its stay-at-home order and as Los Angeles County has become the epicenter of the virus outbreak and lags progress the rest of the state has shown. While the virus was initially worse in Northern California, LA County, home to a quarter of the state\u2019s nearly 40 million residents, now accounts for more than half the state\u2019s deaths and a case count growing more rapidly than other major state counties. A large nursing home population, accounting for about half the county\u2019s deaths, and densely housed poor people are two main reasons. The Trump machine continues to hammer away at presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Only days after launching a barrage of negative digital ads questioning the former vice-president\u2019s mental acuity, Donald Trump Jr came in hot on Saturday morning with an Instagram post suggesting Biden is a pedophile. The Triggered author went on to clarify, via Twitter, that it was only a joke. New York governor Andrew Cuomo reports that hospitalizations, intubations and new coronavirus cases are continuing to trend downward across the state during his daily press briefing from Albany. He adds that 157 people died of Covid-19 in the last 24-hour period, pushing the overall toll past 22,400: \u201cThat number has been stubborn.\u201d Horse racing tracks across New York state will be permitted to open as of 1 June without fans. Same for Watkins Glen International race track in the Finger Lakes region, which clears the way for the Nascar race originally scheduled for August to take place. \u201cYou want to increase economic activity as much as you can without spiking the infection rate,\u201d he says. Outside the state capitol building, anti-shutdown protesters are making themselves heard. Ohio\u2019s prison system will resume accepting inmates from county jails to begin their prison sentences beginning on Monday. The practice had been suspended in an effort to reduce overcrowding amid the coronavirus outbreak. The Associated Press reports: On Monday, the state will take up to 50 inmates a day at the Correctional Reception Center in central Ohio. Authorities will hold inmates a minimum of 35 days before transferring them to facilities around the state based on their security level and other factors. The agency needs to resume housing inmates as Ohio courts reopen, says JoEllen Smith, spokeswoman for the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. \u201cReopening the reception process will be done in a gradual controlled manner while we continue to carefully monitor county jail operations,\u201d Smith said. The announcement comes even as positive cases of Covid-19 continue to rise in Ohio prisons along with inmate deaths. More than 4,500 inmates system-wide have tested positive or nearly one in 10. Some 60 inmates have died across seven institutions. A 23-year-old man was arrested in the state earlier this week after, as CNN reports, he posted beach pictures on Instagram when he was supposed to be in quarantine. The 23-year-old man was arrested for violating Hawaii\u2019s mandatory 14-day quarantine rule and for \u201cunsworn falsification to authority,\u201d the Hawaii governor\u2019s office said in a statement. He arrived in O\u2019ahu on Monday and posted pictures of himself on the beach. He allegedly used public transportation to get to the many places he was pictured, the statement said. \u201cAuthorities became aware of his social media posts from citizens who saw posts of him -- on the beach with a surfboard, sunbathing, and walking around Waikiki at night,\u201d the statement said. Tarique Peters of the Bronx borough of New York City was arrested along with a local man who was with him, and charges are pending against him. Peters was booked and his bail is set at $4,000. Hawai\u2018i Attorney General Clare Connors said, \u201cWe appreciate the assistance of local people who spot flagrant violations of our emergency rules on various social media sites and report them to the appropriate authorities.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s Friday night delights The president has a habit \u2013 firing watchdogs when the fewest amount of eyeballs are on the news. Last night it was the turn of Steve Linick at the State Department, although fortunately the Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, rests with one eye open and filed this report in short order, which was launch into the public domain by my colleagues in Australia (the Guardian never sleeps, Mr President). And the Washington Post has noted some of the other recent timings of inspectors general being axed under cover of darkness and relative Friday night torpor among news audiences. Julian notes in his piece that, according to a Democratic congressional aide, just before his abrupt dismissal last night, Linick had opened an investigation into allegations that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been using a political appointee at the state department to run personal errands for him and his wife, Susan. Linick is to be replaced by Stephen Akard, a close ally of the vice-president, Mike Pence, from his home state of Indiana. A state department spokesperson said that Akard, who has been running the office for foreign missions, would take over immediately as acting inspector general. Good morning, US live blog readers, we\u2019ll bring you all the US politics and coronavirus news here today and there is a lot going on in America this weekend, so stay tuned. Here\u2019s what is developing so far: Almost all US states are engaging in some form of reopening for business by the end of this weekend - 48 states, excluding Massachusetts and Connecticut. That includes some rural districts of New York state even though the world\u2019s hotspot for coronavirus - the Big Apple - is still under max restrictions. This comes while states are under intense pressure from Donald Trump to reopen, but after a week of warnings from America\u2019s top public health experts that rushing to lift stay-at-home orders without a sustained decline in new cases risks \u201cserious consequences\u201d. And an Associated Press analysis found that 41 of the nation\u2019s 50 states fall short of the Covid-19 testing levels that experts say are necessary to avoid another wave of outbreaks. Donald Trump is at the presidential retreat Camp David, where he is up and very, very busy tweeting and retweeting. Perhaps the most arresting one so far is a retweet of an article that says: \u201cThe fact is that we already have more compelling evidence that the Obama administration engaged in misconduct than we ever did for opening the Russian-collusion investigation.\u201d Trump tweeted: \u201cSo true!\u201d Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s David Smith this morning on 45\u2019s obsession with 44 as the election looms... Talking of Barack Obama, the former president will give a virtual commencement address this afternoon at 2pm ET for students graduating from America\u2019s Historically Black Universities and Colleges (HBCU). Then at 8pm ET he joins some other luminaries to give another virtual commencement address for the US\u2019s high schoolers who are graduating. It\u2019s some consolation for the students who aren\u2019t able to gather in person for the usual celebratory ceremonies. And the fall-out will continue from the Trump administration\u2019s firing overnight of the state department watchdog Steve Linick."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
