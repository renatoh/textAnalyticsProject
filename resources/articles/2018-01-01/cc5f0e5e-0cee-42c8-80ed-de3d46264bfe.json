On Wednesday, Nassar was jailed for up to 175 years and the judge paid tribute to the bravery of those who came forward to detail Nassar\u2019s abuse. Below are some of the most striking stories. Kyle Stephens Stephens was abused by Nassar, a family friend, between the ages of six and 12. She said that she told her parents about Nassar\u2019s abuse but he convinced them she was lying. Let me remind you of the interests of a six-year-old girl. My favorite TV show was Clifford the Big Red Dog. I could not do a multiplication problem, and I still had not lost all my baby teeth. I think we can all agree that someone of this maturity level should not be sexually active, but I was. I testified to let the world know that you are a repulsive liar. Perhaps you have figured it out by now, but little girls don\u2019t stay little for ever. They grow into strong women that destroy your world. Jamie Dantzscher Jamie Dantzscher, a 2000 Olympic bronze medalist who was one of the first women to publicly accuse Nassar, described her struggles with \u201canorexia, bulimia, and depression so severe that I was hospitalized for attempting suicide\u201d. I couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong with me. Why I was struggling so much. Why I didn\u2019t feel proud of my accomplishments. I had zero self confidence \u2026 You are pure evil. McKayla Maroney McKayla Maroney, who helped the US gymnastics team to a gold medal at the London Olympics, gave her statement via a prosecutor. For me, the scariest night of my life happened when I was 15 years old. I had flown all day and night to get to Tokyo [for a competition]. [Nassar gave] me a sleeping pill for the flight, and the next thing I know, I was all alone with him in his hotel room getting a \u2018treatment\u2019. I thought I was going to die that night. As it turns out ... Dr Nassar was not a doctor, he in fact is, was, and forever shall be, a child molester and a monster of a human being. End of story. He abused my trust, he abused my body and he left scars on my psyche that may never go away. Aly Raisman Aly Raisman, a six-time Olympic medalist who went public with her story in November after speaking to FBI investigators, spoke directly to Nassar in court. \u201cAdult after adult protected you. How do you sleep at night? You are the person they had \u2018take the lead on athlete care\u2019. I cringe to think your influence remains in the policies they [USA Gymnastics] claim will make athletes safe. I will not rest until every last trace of the influence you had on this sport has been destroyed like the cancer it is. Jordyn Wieber Jordyn Wieber helped the USA team known as the Fierce Five to a gold medal at the London Olympics. Nassar treated her as a patient between the ages of eight and 18. Even though I\u2019m a victim, I do not and will not live my life as one. I\u2019m an Olympian despite being abused. I worked hard and managed to achieve my goal. But I want everyone especially the media to know that despite my athletic achievements I am one of over 140 women and survivors whose story is important. Larry Nassar is accountable. USA Gymnastics is accountable. The US Olympic Committee is accountable. My team-mates and friends have been through enough, and now it\u2019s time for change. The current gymnasts should not have to live in anxiety and fear as I did."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
