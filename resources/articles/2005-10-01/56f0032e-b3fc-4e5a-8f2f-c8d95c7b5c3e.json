There was real sand on the floor, deckchairs, choc ices, inflatable playthings and even sound effects of seagulls. Broadstairs had come to Broadcasting House. I know this because I was there. As a staff announcer on Radio 4, I had been selected to contribute to an internal consultation exercise entitled Making It Happen. The seaside setting was intended to help us relax, to brainstorm, to unleash eureka ideas to improve the workplace. My eureka idea was to walk out and go shopping instead. As far as I was concerned, the BBC-on-Sea wheeze was an elaborate and patronising con trick dreamt up by the former director general Greg Dyke to quell revolution among a disgruntled workforce and give the illusion that we were valued. It didn't fool me. In truth, Making It Happen made almost nothing happen. Dyke's talking shop enabled us to tussle with such critical choices as whether we should have red or blue carpet tiles in the Radio 4 presentation office. Our low wages never got a makeover, mind you. Incredibly, I was told, this was because none of the 28,000 staff surveyed for the exercise had complained about their pay. And now the BBC, under its new steward Mark Thompson, has launched another of these pointless initiatives - this time entitled Creative Future. It will involve discussions between people inside and outside the corporation, in order, he says, to address the needs of the BBC's audiences and develop a vision for the next five years. Even someone with the intellect of compost can predict that Creative Future will absorb vast tracts of time, cost a fortune and produce no discernible outcome. Last time, it was all about boosting low morale. Two and a half years after Making It Happen began, I received a letter from the controller of Radio 4 which said: \"I would like to take this opportunity to thank you personally for your hard work and contribution to Radio 4.\" Valuing me, however, did not extend to getting my name right. The letter was addressed to John Muirhead. When it began \"Dear John ... \" I knew that a once happy marriage was on the rocks. Being valued for most BBC employees has never been about high-rolling salaries. But once, at a staff meeting, several of us made uppity remarks about our pitiful pay and got short shrift. Revealing the BBC's true estimation of our worth, the controller said baldly: \"Well, if you don't like it, you know what you have to do.\" I didn't like it so I left. As a well-known broadcaster on the BBC's premier national radio service I was earning around \u00a335,000 - a fraction of the cash bonanza lavished on TV newscasters and slightly less than the earnings of a competent painter and decorator. I have since enhanced my employment status by becoming exactly that, and now run a small decorating business in West Sussex. Susan Spindler, the architect of Creative Future - who also steered the idiotic Making It Happen - says: \"Fundamental questions have to be asked about our audiences, output and services. It is no longer just about deciding to broadcast a programme at 9pm.\" Indeed not, apparently, if there is an opportunity to squander lorry-loads of licence fee payers' lolly on a wholly unnecessary waffle-fest first. The process will uncover nothing that any switched-on producer could not tell you in 20 minutes over a skinny latte in the staff canteen. But then the authors of these initiatives would be deprived of an outlet for such jargon as \"genre strategies\", \"creative leaders\" and \"workstreams\" with which Creative Future is so richly endowed. The BBC's over-reliance on consultants is legendary. A team-building specialist was brought into Radio 4 once at a reputed cost of \u00a320,000 to improve our \"departmental interfacing\". Another newsreader, the late Laurie Macmillan, and I were commanded to engage in some tai chi moves and, red faced, we grappled and groped with each other inelegantly beneath the nonplussed gaze of a smattering of Radio 4 personalities. \"God almighty!\" hissed Laurie in my ear as she shoved me into a painful neck lock. \"How much longer have we got to go on with this rubbish?\" It was an amusing diversion from intoning the shipping forecast. But as a team-building exercise it served only to unite us in snorts of derision for our managers and anger at the frittering away of the public's money. The consultant was never invited back. Creative Future will consult people in the \"creative community\", according to the BBC. These include \"programme-makers, strategists and marketers [sic]\". In what way these last two groups fall into the category of \"creative\" eludes me. Their only creative effort at the corporation is finding ways to look busy while the depleted corps of bona-fide programme-makers run around with their pants on fire. The DG's decision to confer with those at the true creative coalface came only after his announcement to make vast numbers of them redundant, triggering May's strike by 11,000 staff. A former BBC colleague wryly observed: \"The cuts will now produce one saving - there'll be fewer of us to consult.\" Such cuts might not even be necessary if wastage were properly controlled. While I was at Radio 4, a new network continuity studio was built, costing about \u00a31m. It was never used and dismantled soon afterwards when the re-modelling of Broadcasting House began. Those responsible clearly possessed the strategic foresight of a scatter cushion. Dyke's vision for Making It Happen was probably well-intentioned. After canvassing the staff exhaustively and cherry-picking the cheapest complaints to remedy, legions of managers were sent away for training junkets at a former stately home at heart-stopping expense and a list of BBC Values was drawn up. These amounted to a homily on the virtue of working hard for a pittance without complaint. It also resulted in loopy innovations such as work experience job swaps where one member of staff would try out someone else's job in another department - just long enough to cause administrative mayhem. \"Would you like to have a go at clerical tasks in the office?\" my boss asked me one day without a trace of irony. I agonised over this exceedingly un-tempting offer for one nanosecond: \"I'd rather continue reading the news to Radio 4's 10 million listeners, if that's OK with you,\" I said. The BBC's problems are straightforward: it is choked with dead wood, over-managed but under-led and entrenched in inflexible, archaic methods. Creative Future will lead to creativity by committee - ie, indecision, inertia and ineluctable expense. And if things go wrong you can be sure there will be no one to take the blame. The BBC does not readily sack people. Far too many managers arrive at their posts by being promoted away from the wreckage of some earlier fiasco of their making. The BBC does not need Creative Future - it has a peerless creative future without the costly bother of consultations. It needs to be brave, trust itself, cast out the demon consultants, cut the waste and trim away swathes of managers. That way the inner core of hard-working, truly talented individuals who make Britain's much-admired radio and TV gems could be properly thanked and rewarded."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
