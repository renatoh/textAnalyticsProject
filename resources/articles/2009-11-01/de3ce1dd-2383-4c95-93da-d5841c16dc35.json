It was in 1979 and the Observer office was tucked away in Blackfriars, not too far from the Old Bailey. The Jeremy Thorpe trial was just finishing and I said: \"Does anyone want a photograph of Jeremy Thorpe?\" Someone said: \"Oh no, we're not interested.\" But I thought: \"I'm jolly well going.\" It wasn't very far away. The reason I like the shot so much is more down to the circumstances under which it was taken. The whole trial had been such a strange affair [Thorpe, the former leader of the Liberal party, was acquitted of attempted murder and conspiracy]. There were crowds of people waiting for him outside. We didn't know whether he would come out or not, or whether he was going to try for a secret getaway. So when he did come out, everyone went mad. We had been told beforehand that he would make a speech, that he would talk to reporters in four different places in turn. That way the photographers would all be able to get a shot. But I knew that wasn't going to happen \u2013 it never does. Everyone would just pounce. So I got low down, because that's what I always do. I'm short \u2013 five foot and half an inch \u2013 and photographers are always pushing me down when I get in their way. I was half-kneeling when I noticed a whole column of policemen forming outside the Old Bailey. I realised they were making a little path and I thought: I bet he's coming down that path, which indeed he did. That's how I got the picture. No one else had spotted it, so I was able to get into a good position. The other pictures all show him surrounded by reporters. This was the only one of him on his own. I'm quite wily, you see, I like outsmarting the others. I've never thought of myself as a portrait photographer. I suppose I am, by definition, but I like the rough and tumble, getting in there first. CV Born: Dorset, 1925. Has been taking photographs for the Observer since 1949. Studied: \"Guildford School of Art. It was the first photographic school after the war.\" Inspiration: \"I never took much interest in photography when I was younger. Does that sound awful?\" High point: \"Nothing really. I'm hopeless. I'm always short on words.\" Top tip: \"Keep looking. That's all I did. Kept my eyes open.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
