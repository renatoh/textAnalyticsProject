The teenager, who has been included in the England Under-19 squad for next month's European Championship qualification tournament involving Romania, Moldova and Macedonia, confirmed he will finally sign a three-year deal with a two-year option as he marked his birthday by touring Liverpool's Alder Hey children's hospital. \"I will sign my contract with Everton as soon as is possible,\" said Rooney, who became the Premiership's youngest goalscorer last Saturday with his last-minute winner that condemned the champions Arsenal to a first defeat in 31 league games. \"There will be a delay, which is unfortunate. \"The problem is that my current agent has not agreed to terminate our agreement even though it does run out in December. I do want any negotiations regarding my contract to be handled by the people at Proactive, the man agement company I have chosen to represent me.\" Proactive Sports Group plc, whose chief executive Paul Stretford announced pre-tax profits of \u00a31.4m and a turnover of \u00a38.1m after its first year of trading, boasts 189 internationals among the 384 players on its books. The former Liverpool player and manager Kenny Dalglish is the company's football operations director and the former Anfield chief executive Peter Robinson is also on the board. Rooney is likely to find himself back on the bench for Everton's televised Premiership match at West Ham on Sunday, though the focus will still be on the precocious talent and boyhood Blue from Croxteth. Admirably calm amid the hysteria that even generated headlines in the Moscow Post this week, he donated his boots to Alder Hey's Rocking Horse Appeal yesterday, with the Everton deputy chairman Bill Kenwright opening the bidding at \u00a31,000. \"I'm just really enjoying my football at the moment and I love training with the rest of the lads,\" he said. \"I am a pretty down-to-earth sort of a lad, so I don't think I am going to change too much. \"I think everyone knows that me and my family are Everton-mad. For as long as I can remember, I have dreamed of playing for the club and to have actually appeared in the first team before my 17th birthday is just fantastic. \"Scoring my first Premiership goal against Arsenal last Saturday was absolutely wonderful, a moment I will never, ever forget. Although I was some distance from the goal, I knew that time was running out; I thought it was worth me having a go. I saw a gap in the top corner of the goal and just aimed for it. When the ball went in I couldn't contain myself.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
