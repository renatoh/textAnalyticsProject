Octavian Ursu of the CDU was elected as G\u00f6rlitz\u2019s mayor at the weekend following a tight second-round run-off in which the AfD candidate was defeated only after the Greens and the Left party agreed to withdraw their candidates and unite in their support for Ursu. The AfD had been on course to win its first mayoralty after its candidate, Sebastian Wippel, a former police officer, won the first round of the vote on 26 May, with 36.4%, six points ahead of Ursu. Ursu, a trained classical trumpeter, secured 55% of the vote on Sunday, 10 points ahead of Wippel. Actors, directors and others who made films on location in G\u00f6rlitz had called on residents to vote against Wippel. The petition urged voters not to succumb to \u201chate and enmity, discord and exclusion\u201d. It was signed by the British director Stephen Daldry, who filmed The Reader partly in G\u00f6rlitz; the actor Daniel Br\u00fchl, who appeared in Goodbye Lenin; and the writer Bernhard Schlink, among others, according to France 24. AfD condemned the letter as unwelcome outside advice. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the national head of the Christian Democrats (CDU), who is positioning herself to replace Angela Merkel as chancellor, was criticised for trying to claim his win as a victory for the CDU and failing to acknowledge the contributions of the other parties. \u201cOctavian Ursu and the CDU in Saxony have shown in G\u00f6rlitz that the CDU is the civic power against the AfD,\u201d she tweeted. She was met by a storm of protest from across the parties, in particular those which had united to stop Wippel. Erik Marquardt of the Greens, which withdrew its candidate who secured 28% after the first round, responded on Twitter: \u201cBefore you get round to thanking the leftwing parties for enabling this victory, there\u2019ll probably be no more ice left in Greenland, will there?\u201d Two hours later, Kramp-Karrenbauer was forced to effectively retract her previous statement, writing: \u201cOctavian Ursu\u2019s victory is the victory of a broad alliance for which I am grateful.\u201d It is the latest in a series of gaffes for which Kramp-Karrenbauer has been pilloried. Ursu has pledged to reach out to voters who did not vote for him. \u201cNow we have to see about getting close to those who didn\u2019t choose me,\u201d he said. Wippel, meanwhile, has claimed his result of almost 45% as a significant and respectable standing for the AfD, \u201cconsidering that all the other parties mobilised their forces against us\u201d. G\u00f6rlitz, on the German-Polish border, has built a reputation as Germany\u2019s Hollywood \u2013 or G\u00f6rliwood as it is nicknamed \u2013 due to its picturesque city landscape that unlike most German cities was largely undamaged during the second world war. The Grand Budapest Hotel and Inglourious Basterds are among the films shot in G\u00f6rlitz. The city attracts more than 300,000 tourists every year, drawn by its late-gothic and early Renaissance architecture as well as the many film locations, mostly in its old town. But tens of thousands of mainly young residents have left over the past three decades, driven largely by a high unemployment rate. It has become instead a magnet for pensioners from western Germany attracted by its relative cheapness and picturesque qualities. The vote has been seen as a bellwether for how well the AfD may perform in September\u2019s state elections in the former communist east, including in Saxony, where G\u00f6rlitz is situated. Polls show the AfD is due to make strong gains in both Saxony and Brandenburg, as well as in Thuringia, which goes to the polls a little over a month later. The conservative newspaper Die Welt said that at first glance Ursu\u2019s success in G\u00f6rlitz resembled something of a \u201csmall midsummer fairytale\u201d. But it said instead it should be viewed as a warning. \u201cThe fact that Ursu\u2019s opponent from the AfD secured almost 45% of the votes \u2026 shows that the party possesses a considerable strength, comparable to that of the established parties. \u201cEven the other candidates\u2019 decision to withdraw and even the many appeals \u2026 including from Hollywood for people to please vote \u2018correctly\u2019, did not succeed in isolating and downgrading the AfD.\u201d The AfD\u2019s leader, J\u00f6rg Meuthen, said Wippel\u2019s result was proof \u201cthat there\u2019s no holding back the AfD any more\u201d. The party has been the main opposition in government since 2017 and is represented in all 16 state legislatures.
