The Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s final report into RBS\u2019s now-defunct Global Restructuring Group (GRG) said it would take no action against the lender or senior staff despite evidence of \u201csystemic and widespread\u201d mistreatment of small- and medium-sized business customers between 2008 and 2013. \u201cThe firm\u2019s relations with its customers were often insensitive, dismissive and sometimes too aggressive; these failings made an already stressful situation worse,\u201d said Andrew Bailey, the regulator\u2019s chief executive. The FCA also found that RBS failed to manage a conflict of interest involving the bank\u2019s property firm, West Register, which was used to buy assets from distressed companies \u2013 including companies that had been diverted into the GRG unit. However, the FCA dismissed allegations that the bank pushed thousands of business customers into administration in order to strip them of their assets and buy them more cheaply. In some cases, victims say they were forced to restructure loans that resulted in extortionate fees and higher interest rates, which pushed them further into financial difficulty or administration. The Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake hit out at the FCA\u2019s conclusions and decision to withhold names of senior managers he said were responsible for the mistreatment of thousands of SMEs. The co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on fair business banking and finance said: \u201cThis report is another complete whitewash and another demonstrable failure of the regulator to perform its role.\u201d The SME Alliance, a small business pressure group, said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d that despite evidence of mistreatment, no bankers had been held to account. \u201c[The FCA] seems to have concluded none of RBS, its staff or its senior management could or should be held accountable in any way. It begs the question of why the FCA started an investigation or produced a report at all when the only real beneficiaries will have been the authors?,\u201d said Nikki Turner, director of the SME Alliance. Clive May, a victim of the GRG unit, said he was not surprised by the FCA\u2019s response, given his experience with the regulator throughout his \u201clong, arduous journey\u201d trying to get to the bottom of a case he believes amounts to fraud. \u201cI was never really thinking the FCA were likely to do anything.\u201d The north Wales-based bricklayer said RBS pushed him into taking a special government-backed loan in 2010 before cutting his overdraft limit. His banking costs rose significantly before he was diverted into the GRG division, unbeknown to him, where his business then collapsed. \u201cThe whole episode is shocking,\u201d the 55-year-old said. The FCA said RBS was \u201cunder unprecedented stress\u201d after its government bailout during the 2008 financial crisis, when the number of customers entering the GRG unit surged. Bailey stressed that RBS has taken action and responded to the FCA\u2019s recommendations. But with commercial lending still unregulated in the UK, business customers do not fall under the financial watchdog\u2019s jurisdiction. That anomaly has allowed RBS and GRG\u2019s senior managers to escape disciplinary action despite evidence of mistreatment in the FCA\u2019s report. The FCA\u2019s investigation, first launched in 2014, said the regulator was ultimately powerless to take action, given that business lending is outside its jurisdiction. The Treasury select committee has urged the government to reconsider regulating business lending. \u201cOtherwise, scandalous events such as those at GRG could recur,\u201d said Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee. Bailey said businesses should take comfort in new rules, including the new senior managers and certification regime,which he said would now help hold misbehaving bankers to account. He also highlighted the extended powers granted to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which now covers complaints from a wider range of SMEs. However, the FCA has refused to speculate whether it would have punished RBS under the new rules. \u201cWe cannot say whether we would have been able to bring successful cases against RBS senior management,\u201d it said. The RBS chairman, Howard Davies, said the bank welcomed the FCA\u2019s final report, which it said drew a line under the GRG affair. \u201cThe way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty today is fundamentally different to the aftermath of the financial crisis, during what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. We are committed to ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated,\u201d Davies said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
