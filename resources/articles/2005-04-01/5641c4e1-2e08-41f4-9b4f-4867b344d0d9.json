It is not yet four years since Tony Blair and the Labour government were re-elected to govern this country for a five-year term. The last election, in 2001, like the one that was announced yesterday, came with a whole year of the parliament yet to run, and with the government still enjoying a very large Commons majority. In constitutional terms, therefore, it can surely be argued that the 2005 general election is unnecessary. So, before we all get caught up in the demands of the coming campaign, it is worth asking whether there is any longer any point in Britain's five-year parliamentary terms. It may also be worth a moment's reflection on whether the prime ministerial prerogative to request a parliamentary dissolution from the sovereign needs to be rethought in some way. If the natural rhythms of modern politics are for the regular election of a new parliament every four years - as seems now the case - why don't we just legislate to make it so? If the law is an ass, change it. Even so, it was clearly high time for the speculation to end. There may not be any constitutional need for a May 2005 election, and there appears little appetite in the country for what we will experience for the next month. But the second Blair government has been running out of steam. Its every action has been haunted for more than two years by the Iraq war. Its parliamentary discipline to enact key aspects of its domestic programme has visibly dissolved. And it has been badly disabled by disputes between the rival Blair and Brown camps. It is obviously the right time for this wounded and traumatised government to go to the country. It is time either to dismiss the Labour government in favour of one of its rivals - or for the British people to give it a fresh mandate. This is the central question to which minds should now turn. It would be good to think that this time round our political parties - and our media - might produce something better than the half-truths and scare stories that are the stock in trade of modern campaigns. For Britain very badly needs a period of more honest reflection and more truthful discussion than it has recently had about itself. Politics ought to be more than entertainment. It ought to be about the kind of country we want to become over the period of the next parliament. It ought to be about deciding which party is best equipped to assist that process. We certainly have to make judgments about the past, but an election is about a programme for the future. We have to think harder thoughts than many of us sometimes do about the balance of economic prosperity, social justice, individual liberty and international stability that would make this a country to be optimistic about. To do that, we have to think not just about our own individual comfort and family aspirations, but also those of others, and to think about the common good, here and abroad. We have to ask ourselves what is really wrong with this country - and decide which result would best equip us to deal with that. Maybe this is too much to hope for. But at least we should start the campaign with high aims. This newspaper will listen and report, scrutinise and discuss. We will offer our verdict on the basis of what we hear, see and believe. If there is one goal that all parties should share at the outset, it is surely that the turnout in 2005 increase from the unprecedented low of 59% in 2001. Politicians, media and voters should all have an interest in encouraging people to vote and not stay at home. The fact that this time round the result is much less predictable than in 2001 will surely help in that process. Mr Blair rightly said yesterday that a general election is a big choice. This election will not be an easy one, but that in no way diminishes the importance of what is at stake."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
