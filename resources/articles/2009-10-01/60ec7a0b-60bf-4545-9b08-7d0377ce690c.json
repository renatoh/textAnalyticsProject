The previous evening he had played his final home game for St Helens, after 12 years at a club where every success on the field has been matched by controversy off it. Long scored a crucial try and set up another in the 14\u201110 win that guaranteed St Helens a place, for the third successive year, in this weekend's Grand Final against Leeds. Yet it was his defence that was the most compelling facet of last Saturday's headline-winning performance against his hometown club, Wigan, who had rejected him as a teenager. Long might have been even more troubled at 18 than at the height of his infamy but the intensity of his tackling spoke of a man who still bears a grudge against Wigan \u2013 where he continues to live his madcap life. \"I had a lot on my mind all Saturday,\" a battered Long says, chewing thoughtfully on his delicate sandwich. \"It was my last game at Knowsley Road so it was quite emotional. In the dressing room before a game we usually just shake hands. But all the boys came and gave me a love.\" Long wraps his arms around himself, to show how fondly he was embraced. \"It could have been the last game we played together so that got me going.\" The 33-year-old has won the Grand Final four times, and is the only player in rugby league history to have been awarded the sport's most evocative individual prize, the Lance Todd Trophy, for the man of the match at the Challenge Cup final, on three separate occasions. Yet, typically for Long, he prepared for Saturday's semi-final by publicising his autobiography (Longy: Booze, Brawls, Sex and Scandal, published by John Blake) that afternoon in a St Helens bookshop. \"I signed about 500 books,\" he grins. The coach, Mick Potter, was apparently relaxed about the diversion \u2013 believing, much to the player's amusement, that Long would have spent the afternoon washing his car had he not been peddling a book thick with sensation. \"Why write a book if you're not going to be honest?\" Long shrugs. \"I'm an honest bloke. Saints have been cool. Saints have been sweet. The chairman said I had a couple of things wrong but he also said, 'I've read the book and it's hilarious.' I've not lied or bagged the game. I'm just telling my side of the story.\" His former team-mate Martin Gleeson almost choked on his pint when he heard Long had written an autobiography. \"Who's publishing it,\" Gleeson snorted. \"Fucking Ladybird?\" Long, it can be safely written, is not a literary man. When he first spotted his future wife, Claire, working as a cabin attendant on a flight Saints took to Lanzarote, his initial thought of \"Come to Papa\" was soon replaced by anxiety. Realising he would not be able to chat her up in front of his team-mates he worried that his plan to write her a note would leave her thinking she had been propositioned by a seven-year-old. In the end he convinced his captain, Paul Sculthorpe, to pen the letter on his behalf. He and Claire ended up together, with three children, but his autobiography has caused friction at home. \"She was quite surprised and a little upset by some of the stuff,\" Long grimaces. \"She's a really nice girl, my wife, who's been brought up really well. We had a couple of chats about it and I reminded her that most of the stuff happened before I met her.\" Less personally, Long now goes even further by adding more to his published revelations about the public saga which left him, in his words, \"at the centre of the biggest scandal to ever hit my sport\". Long and Gleeson had each wagered \u00a31,000 that Saints would lose to Bradford in April 2004. They were convinced of the outcome because Long was injured and Ian Millward, then their coach, was going to rest 11 other senior players. Long and Gleeson could not help themselves and, as excitable as they were stupid, placed the bets in their own names. In his book Long suggests that they were not alone. \"Everyone seemed to have money on Bradford. Players, mates of players, the bloke who sells the pies, the bloke who sells the pies' milkman, the milkman's postman, the postman's mistress \u2026\" Beyond the banter, more serious questions need to be asked. How many players placed an illegal bet on that game? \"I don't know. I'd say \u2026\" Long pauses, putting down his sandwich as he calculates the odds. Half-a-dozen? \"Yeah, half-a-dozen. Maybe more \u2026\" Having broken his jaw badly, for the third time, this summer, the left side of Long's face remains afflicted with a kind of paralysis. If the damaged nerves should eventually heal, it currently means that, while the right side is as expressive as ever, the left side of his face is unable to move. The contrast between the two sides is telling as he counts the players who might have bet on a Bradford win. Could that number reach 10? \"Yeah, probably. I could get in trouble here by saying Bradford had a bet on it but I've spoken to two players who don't play for them anymore who had a bet on that game. [Bradford] keep saying, 'Oh, we didn't have a bet on the game.' They didn't but two players I spoke to did. So either they're telling me lies or \u2026\" His implication is clear: the unnamed Bradford players placed their bets through a third party. \"Of course. They're cleverer than us. Me and Glees are a little naive and thick.\" How many other Saints players had also bet on the match? \"Half-a-dozen. Yeah. Half-a-dozen.\" Yet only Long and Gleeson were caught and punished \u2013 with Long accepting his three-month ban and \u00a350,000 in fines and legal fees. \"I don't mind. We took the rap for everyone really. It's only because we fucked up and put it in our own name \u2013 otherwise no one would have known. You know what I mean? You could still go bet on a rugby match now and get someone else to put it in your name. No one would know. If we had done it right none of this would have come out. They had to make an example of us.\" Does betting, which has always been against Super League rules, still occur among players today? \"I would say people who like a bet may have a bet on rugby,\" Long says carefully, raising his right eyebrow. The left remains stock-still. \"They just get someone else to put it on for them.\" Long looks amused but sounds as if he is dealing in hard facts. \"I don't know what other people do,\" he says more archly, \"but if you like watching rugby, and there was some money on it, it would be better watching for you \u2013 if you know what I mean. If someone has \u00a350 on a team to win, and you obviously don't know the outcome, a betting player would get someone to put the bet on for him. Why not? It makes the game more interesting. It's not like you've got inside information, like me and Glees did. It's like betting on football and saying 'I'll have \u00a310 on Rooney to score.'\" Insisting that he no longer bets on rugby league, and that he does not know any players who wagered money on fixtures involving their own team, Long admits to placing a different gamble even before the Bradford debacle. He wagered money that Saints would score the first points in a Super League match via a drop-goal. \"In fact that's probably worse than the other one,\" he says. \"But it never came off.\" Rather than feeling remorseful Long enjoyed parts of his gambling expose when he and Gleeson were tailed by the national press and they went into hiding in a caravan. \"It was a really mad buzz. I hope I don't have to do it again but, yeah, it was a massive buzz.\" It's safe to assume his team-mates have not been as enthusiastic about his book. \"A couple of them did say, 'You've not mentioned my name?' and I said, 'No, you're all right.' I could have gone to town with names. But I didn't want to hurt anyone. The only one I want to take the piss out of is me.\" Beyond the ritual tales of boozing and bonking, a residual sadness rises to the surface. \"I went off the rails big time in 2002,\" Long sighs, tugging at his dreadlocks. \"I don't know why but I got a bit of a depression. People think if you're having sex all the time, and going out drinking, it's great. But I was crying out for someone. It was a bad time in my life. You know when you're unhappy and you've got a bad head and you're looking at all these people passed out in your house. You think, 'Who are these people? What the fuck am I doing?' Luckily for me, the year after, I met Claire.\" Long is equally certain that he was \"saved\" by rugby league. \"It's 100% that I would've ended up in jail if it hadn't been for the sport. Rugby saved my life. If it hadn't been for rugby I would have probably ended up in a gang or been jailed or taking drugs. No doubt.\" As Long drives us back through Wigan he talks animatedly about the myriad tattoos covering his body, as well as the pain he suffered when, pointing to his groin, he had \"the little fella pierced. I've still got the ring in today. I always take things to the limit.\" Long hunches over the wheel and cackles. He might be leaving St Helens after 12 wild and crazy years, and heading for Hull, but he insists, \"I was lot more daft at 21. I was crackers then. But I'm a really clever bloke on the field \u2013 and I'm a lot calmer off it. Most of that is down to the missus.\" His long-suffering wife has already steeled herself for his Grand Final weekend bender. After Saturday's game, Long will be in serious partying mode. \"Claire knows it,\" he says, with a last waggle of his unparalysed eyebrow. \"She knows Saturday, Sunday and Monday I'm gone with these lads for the last time. But then I'll be back on track. I'm not a bad lad. I just do some daft things.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
