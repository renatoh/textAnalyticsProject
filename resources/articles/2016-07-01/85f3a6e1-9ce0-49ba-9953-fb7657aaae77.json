The Football Association is expected to announce the fixture on Monday, when Allardyce will also hold his first press conference since being appointed as Roy Hodgson\u2019s successor last week. It was known then that the 61-year-old\u2019s debut in charge of the national side would be a home friendly but the opponents had not been confirmed. However, it is widely believed that the FA has secured Croatia, who like England reached the last-16 stage at Euro 2016, for a match that will provide Allardyce with the chance to test out his team selection and tactics before the World Cup qualifier against Slovakia on 4 September. It is also expected that Allardyce will name Paul Clement and Sammy Lee as his assistants at Monday\u2019s press conference, which is being held at St George\u2019s Park."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
