Life in the UK has changed like never before in peacetime. People have been told to stay at home where possible and only leave for exercise alone or with members of their household, or to shop for necessities; as key workers continue to work in social care, construction, the media and a number of other industries. Meanwhile, couples who live separately have had to decide whether to move in together or remain apart for the duration of the measures, and house shares have been plunged into unchartered territory. Accessible green spaces are few and far between in many places while millions of people do not have gardens, making the affects of the lockdown particularly acute in towns and cities. We\u2019d like to hear from young people, anyone up to the age of 25, about how life has changed under the lockdown \u2013 particularly in urban areas \u2013 and how they are managing to get by. Share your experiences How have you been affected by the lockdown? What is your daily routine like? How are you exercising? Have you been approached by police? Have you always abided by the rules?
