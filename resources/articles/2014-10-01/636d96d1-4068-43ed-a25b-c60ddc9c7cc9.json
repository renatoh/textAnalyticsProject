Her professional profile on the Doughty Street Chambers website has been changed from Amal Alamuddin to Amal Clooney. The page on the website that carries her profile has crashed since the story was published. The London-based barrister, 36, married Clooney in a four-day celebration in Italy last month. She had originally changed her name to Amal Alamuddin Clooney but is listed simply as Amal Clooney on the website. She has started work on her latest case, in which she is advising Greece on a bid to have the Parthenon marbles, currently in the British Museum, returned to the country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
