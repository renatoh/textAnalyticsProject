Coyle is the new bookmakers' favourite to take charge at the Reebok Stadium and move from one Lancashire club to another even though the 44-year-old has publicly stated that he would not be prepared to leave the project he is \"privileged to be building\" at Turf Moor. The feeling at Bolton is that Coyle is just trying to play a political game in order not to be seen to be campaigning for the move but that he is seriously considering asking his current employers for permission to speak about the vacancy if an official approach was made. Bolton could offer him a considerable pay rise as well as a larger transfer budget and there is a strong emotional pull for Coyle after playing for the club from 1993 to 1995. However, a Burnley spokesman told BBC Radio Lancashire: \"There has been no discussion about our manager's future and no contact from Bolton regarding Owen Coyle.\" Coyle guided Burnley to promotion last season, as well as reaching the Carling Cup semi-finals, and is renowned for making his team play with a passing style that was seldom evident at the Reebok during Megson's time in charge. He was prominently linked with the manager's job at Celtic before Tony Mowbray replaced Gordon Strachan. Peter Reid, currently the assistant manager at Stoke City, also features in Bolton's thoughts, as do Alan Shearer and Gary Speed. But the club are likely to make their first move for Coyle after Burnley's FA Cup third-round tie at MK Dons tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
