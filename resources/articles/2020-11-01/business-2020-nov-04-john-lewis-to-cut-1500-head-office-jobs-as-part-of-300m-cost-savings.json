Its finance director, Patrick Lewis, the great grandson of John Lewis\u2019s founder and the only family member still working for the business, is to exit the department store and Waitrose group after 26 years as part of the changes. Lewis will be replaced by B\u00e9rang\u00e8re Michel, the director of customer service. Her duties will switch to Pippa Wicks, the head of the John Lewis department stores, and James Bailey, the boss of Waitrose, as the group trims down its executive team. The John Lewis Partnership, which employs 78,000 people, paved the way for further job cuts last month when it said it wanted to save an additional \u00a3200m in annual costs. The business, which is owned by its staff who are known as partners, had already announced \u00a3100m of savings, to be achieved by making its head office and other operations more efficient over the next two years. The company said the latest cuts would save \u00a350m a year and would involve the loss of jobs in its strategy, commercial development and operations teams. The group said it wanted to create a simpler and more \u201cagile and flexible head office\u201d that was \u201ceven closer to customers and frontline partners\u201d. It aims to complete the job reductions by April next year. Sharon White, the chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said: \u201cOur partnership plan sets a course to create a thriving and sustainable business for the future. To achieve this we must be agile and able to adapt quickly to the changing needs of our customers. \u201cLosing partners is incredibly hard as an employee-owned business. Wherever possible, we will seek to find new roles in the partnership and we\u2019ll provide the best support and retraining opportunities for partners who leave us.\u201d White described Lewis, who she said was leaving to \u201cseek new opportunities\u201d, as \u201cthe best of the partnership\u201d. She said: \u201cHis determined drive to build the financial strength of the business has granted us the opportunity to emerge stronger from the Covid crisis.\u201d The latest job losses come on top of 1,300 jobs cut when John Lewis closed eight of its 50 department stores this year while it cut one in three senior head office management posts \u2013 75 out of 225 \u2013 as part of a reorganisation announced last year. The company said it hoped to find alternative jobs within the business for some and would offer those being made redundant after at least two years\u2019 service a leaving package including up to \u00a33,000 towards retraining."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
