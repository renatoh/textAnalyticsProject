Indeed, plenty of performers with a strong eye for visuals \u2013 from Kraftwerk and Queen to Madonna and Janelle Mon\u00e1e \u2013 have plundered the film's still-impressive imagery for their videos and artwork. Perhaps the oddest and least cherished of these Metropolis and music crossovers is this 1984 version, overseen by Giorgio Moroder. Tinting it with colour, adding subtitles and sound effects, music and songs, Moroder made the film seem a little less black and white, slightly less German and a lot less silent. His intention, if misguided, was more honourable than heretical. Even though this cut is shorter than usual, it does include footage that was previously thought lost, while missing scenes are recreated with photographs and illustrations. Unfortunately, the music is not the classic disco of Moroder's I Feel Love. Instead it leans towards soft rock, with singers such as Pat Benatar, Adam Ant and Bonnie Tyler performing some very on-the-nose lyrics (their presence, however, introducing the film to many who would otherwise have had little interest). It may feel a little superfluous now, but it kept the film in circulation, put it (briefly) back in cinemas, and for a while was the only Metropolis available. It's an interesting and quite enjoyable curio \u2013 and, strangely, it's Moroder's 80s music and not the film itself that feels dated. DVD, Eureka Forever Marilyn: The Collection Marilyn Monroe was, by most accounts, a difficult person to work with. Wracked by nerves, she'd demand multiple takes of the simplest of scenes. That's if she turned up at all. But when she was on screen, no matter which fine actors were also there, she took ownership of the movie like no other star. This box set contains four of her best, each given a sharp digital dust-off for today's HD-ready viewers. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes sees Monroe paired with Jane Russell, and the pair deliver some expert comedy. Done correctly, Technicolor films are incredible on Blu-ray, and you can see why people used to think Hollywood stars were some sort of supernatural creation: everything looks flawless. Some Like It Hot, with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, is a film everyone should own, if only for those times when you want to watch something perfect. How To Marry A Millionaire and The Seven Year Itch complete the package. Monroe is always in motion. Not just her walk, but her face and body are never still. Her performances just never let go. She made it look so easy, which is what movie stars were supposed to do, but she did it so well that many don't appreciate how finely tuned and impeccably timed she was. Or, to put it another way, how many of today's stars will still be able to light up a screen 50 years from now? DVD and Blu-ray, Fox CFF Collection: Volume 1 \u2013 London Tales Three London-centric adventures from the now defunct Children's Film Foundation, which entertained kids at Saturday morning picture shows for decades, here with Bernard Cribbins and Wilfrid Brambell among the stars. DVD, BFI Gettysburg Producers Ridley and Tony Scott ensure this History Channel documentary about the American civil war battle is enlivened by lots of impressive explosions. Blu-ray &amp; DVD, History Channel La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie Claude Chabrol's classic Ruth Rendell thriller adaptation, which deals with class, dark secrets and blackmail.
