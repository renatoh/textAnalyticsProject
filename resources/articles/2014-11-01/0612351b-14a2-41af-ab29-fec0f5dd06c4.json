Don\u2019t read on if you haven\u2019t seen season four, episode six. Read the episode five blog here. To quote Quinn, \u201cHoly fuuuuuuck.\u201d That was cold. Even for Homeland, a show that has offered up its share of sudden, shocking moments in the past \u2013 Javadi\u2019s graphic stabbing of his wife springs to mind \u2013 Aayan\u2019s execution, by his uncle, no less, was delivered with a remarkable ruthlessness; the sucker punch at the end of an otherwise leisurely episode. Part of me wants to say that I saw it coming \u2013 in retrospect, Aayan\u2019s \u201cI love you\u201d phone call to Carrie should have tipped me off that he was a goner \u2013 but honestly, I did not. Largely, that\u2019s down to how central Aayan has been to this current season, not only in terms of its plotting, but also in providing an innocent foil for Carrie\u2019s increasingly cynical outlook. Homeland has been fixated on where Carrie\u2019s boundaries lie, how far she is willing to go for her cause, and how much her professional self takes a toll on her personal self. From A to B and Back Again takes those competing tensions and pulls them to their elastic limit. For much of this hour Carrie seems fully prepared to send Aayan off to his doom, outwardly at least. It\u2019s Carrie who fakes the ISI raid on the safe house to give Aayan a gentle nudge in the direction of his uncle, and from then on watches him impassively from the CIA ops room. When she encounters hostility about the ethical implications of the mission, Carrie seems remarkably unconcerned about Aayan\u2019s fate: he\u2019s an adult who has aided and abetted a terrorist, she reminds Fara. She\u2019s less impassive than she\u2019d like to let on though: witness the tiny hint of Claire Danes cryface at the end of her soppy phone call with Aayan (broadcast in excruciating fashion). Of course Carrie\u2019s cool, detached persona shatters entirely in the episode\u2019s climactic moments. Haqqani encounters Aayan at their arranged meeting point, but immediately makes him aware that he knows Aayan has been in contact with Carrie, and reveals that she\u2019s a CIA agent. \u201cYou saved my life with your medicine. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m not grateful,\u201d Haqqani says, before putting a bullet into Aayan\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s a devastating moment, yet I\u2019m torn between admiring the boldness of Homeland\u2019s big twist and feeling a little cheated by what it implies. Getting rid of Aayan at this stage does send out a message about the show\u2019s intentions \u2013 that no one is safe \u2013 but it does also suggest that much of the first half of this season has been consigned to the scrapheap. We\u2019re right back to where we were at the season\u2019s opening, with the CIA looking to take out Haqqani. From A to B and back again indeed. There\u2019s one crucial difference, of course: Haqqani has Saul, who was kidnapped last week by ISI operatives and used here as a way to prevent the CIA laying waste to Haqqani\u2019s convoy. It was striking that Carrie was still willing to go through with the air strike despite Saul\u2019s presence, with only Quinn\u2019s intervention preventing the assault. While I didn\u2019t buy that Carrie would sell her mentor down the river, even if she was in a state of emotional numbness following Aayan\u2019s death, in pure clinical terms \u2013 and this season Carrie has largely operated in pure clinical terms \u2013 the move made sense: Saul\u2019s future looks bleak, and Haqqani has now disappeared off into the mountains with someone who knows an awful lot of sensitive information. So what now? Well, the most obvious lead is Dennis, who is becoming bolder in his acts of treason, this week breaking into the safe house and tipping off Tasneem the mysterious blackmailer about its existence. Given Dennis\u2019s remarkable levels of arrogance about his surveillance skills \u2013 increased further here by Tasneem suggesting that he has \u201ca real gift\u201d for spying, I think it\u2019s fairly obvious where this is going: he\u2019s going to get sloppy, and he\u2019s going to get caught. Then again, given the events of From A To B And Back Again, perhaps its best not to try and second-guess where this season of Homeland is going. Notes and observations \u2022 Some unusually lovely cinematography this week as Aayan moved further into the mountainous region. Not often that Homeland gets the chance to show off sweeping vistas like that. \u2022 Credulity watch: a lot of convenient moments of dopiness this week, from Fara not noticing that Dennis had broken into the safe house (he left a fair old mess), to the agent looking into Saul\u2019s flights failing to notify Quinn of his disappearance until the very last second. Most unbelievable of all was that no one in the ops room was keeping an eye on Haqqani\u2019s vehicle when the his three-car convoy went their separate ways. Great job, guys. \u2022 Homeland has just been renewed for a fifth season. How are we all feeling about that? Quote of the week Carrie: \u201cIt\u2019s a discrete mission. It involves Haqqani\u2019s nephew.\u201d Quinn: \u201cSo I\u2019m guessing clothing is optional.\u201d Spying Naked, coming to the Discovery Channel in 2015."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
