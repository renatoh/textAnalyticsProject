The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Pensions Regulator have joined forces on the campaign to raise awareness of the most common tactics used by fraudsters. They said victims of such scams \u2013 which typically begin with an unsolicited phone call or email \u2013 can end up losing their life savings and people are being urged to be on their guard. Pension scams often involve people being persuaded to transfer or cash in their pension pots and put the money into often exotic-sounding investments. They have been around for many years but there has been a surge in activity since April 2015 when the government introduced reforms giving over-55s more freedom in terms of what they can do with their retirement cash. The regulators\u2019 move comes months after MPs were told that firms dubbed \u201csharks\u201d and \u201cvultures\u201d were preying on British Steel pension scheme members to persuade them to transfer their pensions. The FCA said the size of individual pension pots \u2013 sometimes in excess of \u00a31m \u2013 made retirement savings an attractive target for fraudsters. While \u00a391,000 was the average loss reported to Action Fraud in 2017, some individuals have lost a lot more. The Pensions Ombudsman has previously ruled on the case of a man who was persuaded to transfer \u00a3367,000 out of an NHS pension scheme and put it all into an investment involving self-storage units that supposedly offered an 8%-12% return. The ScamSmart advertising campaign, which takes in TV, radio and social media, is targeting pension holders aged 45-65 \u2013 the group judged to be most at risk of scams. The adverts aim to show the contrast between the impact on the victims and the often jet-setting lifestyles enjoyed at their expense by the criminals. The regulators said one of the most common tactics was to offer a \u201cfree pension review\u201d. Others include a firm or individual unexpectedly getting in touch via phone, post or email; promises of guaranteed high returns and downplaying the risks; offering unusual or overseas investments that are not regulated by the FCA, such as overseas hotels, forestry and green energy schemes; and putting people under pressure to make a quick decision, for example with time-limited offers, and sending a courier round with paperwork to sign. Individuals can check the FCA register or call its contact centre on 0800 111 6768 to see if the firm they are dealing with is authorised by the regulator."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
