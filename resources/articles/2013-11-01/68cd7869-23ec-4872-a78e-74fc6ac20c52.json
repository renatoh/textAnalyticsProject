He was one of four players who failed to appear for the second half but while the props Adam Jones and Scott Andrews are expected to return this month, along with the wing Liam Williams, Davies will be out for at least six weeks after suffering a pectoral injury which may require surgery. Wales, who play Argentina on Saturday before taking on Tonga and Australia, have not ruled out two other injured Lions, Jamie Roberts and Alex Cuthbert, taking some part in the autumn series. \"All the players are being assessed and we hope that Jonathan will be available for the Six Nations,\" said the Wales defence coach, Shaun Edwards. \"It was a Test match of epic proportions and I was proud of the way the players hung in there despite all the injuries. Three or four years ago we would have lost by 20 points. I told the players after the match that good times will be ahead. \"There will be pressure on us against Argentina because England put 30 points on them and we are the northern hemisphere champions but we thrive under that. We played at a very high standard on Saturday and that will stand us in good stead for the rest of the month. Alain Rolland said afterwards it was the most physically intense breakdown he had refereed and that was a big statement given his experience.\" Wales were trailing by two points with 12 minutes to go when South Africa scored their third and decisive try, although the TV replay showed that Jaque Fourie, who gave the scoring pass to Fourie du Preez, was offside when he started chasing the scrum-half's kick ahead. \"Perhaps the players should have suggested to the referee that he go upstairs to the video official,\" said Edwards. \"It is new to us this season and I am sure that as time goes on, more incidents like that will be referred. It is a brilliant system and it is about learning.\" Wales will announce their side for the Argentina Test on Thursday. They will consider moving George North from the wing to the centre if Liam Williams recovers from the head injury he sustained against the Springboks, with James Hook and Ashley Beck the other options at 13. Wales have called up two props, Samson Lee and Rhodri Jones, as injury cover and have the option of playing Paul James, the Bath prop, out of position on the tight-head if Adam Jones and Andrews are ruled out. \"The South Africa game was the first time I had played there since the scrum-engagement change,\" said James. \"We know it is going to be a big challenge up-front and, if I am asked to switch, I will.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
