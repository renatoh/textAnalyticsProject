The Durham batsman, who may not need to bat for his country again given the situation at the SCG, has made 67 Test appearances for his country, having made his debut in Galle against Sri Lanka in 2003. He has made 4,259 runs for England, at a healthy average of 40.82, and taken 17 wickets with his medium-pace bowling \u2013 including the key wicket of Mike Hussey in Australia's first innings of the current Test. \"Representing England at Test level has always been a dream of mine and I've been fortunate enough to have enjoyed some amazing highs throughout my Test career,\" he said. \"I'm proud of the fact that I've always given my all for the England Test team but I feel that this is the right time to leave Test cricket having reached some very special achievements, none more satisfying that retaining the Ashes in Australia. \"I also feel now is the time to ensure some of the younger players are given an opportunity at Test level as we have a wealth of talent pushing for places in the England Test team. Clearly I still feel I have a huge amount to offer England in terms of limited overs cricket and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to continue leading the Twenty20 squad and playing a significant role in England's ODI team.\" Collingwood's decision comes after a downswing in his form. The 34-year-old has not made a half-century in his past 11 Test innings, and while in enjoyed one of his best years with the bat in 2009, averaging close to 50, in 2010 his 18 innings produced only 514 runs. In total he made 10 centuries for the national side, with top score the 206 he made against Australia at Adelaide in December 2006. Collingwood remains England's captain in Twenty20 cricket and one-day internationals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
