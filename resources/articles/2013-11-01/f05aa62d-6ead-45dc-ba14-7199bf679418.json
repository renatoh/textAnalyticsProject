Five athletes who competed at London 2012 have since tested positive, including the former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell and the Olympic 4x100m silver medallist Sherone Simpson. Dr Paul Wright's comments come after the World Anti-Doping Agency visited Jamaica following allegations by Ren\u00e9e Anne Shirley, the former executive editor of the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission (Jadco), that there was \"a significant gap of no testing\" on the island between March and July 2012 while its athletes prepared for the Olympics. Shirley said only one random test was conducted in that time. \"The results are not good,\" Wright told the BBC of the failed tests. \"This year alone the results really point the finger. Remember, all of these results except one were caught by Jadco. The problem is these people were tested positive in competition. What that means is months before you know the date of the test and the approximate time of the test. \"So if you fail an in-competition test you haven't only failed a drugs test, you have failed an IQ test. This could be the tip of the iceberg to have so many positives coming in competition. What is going to convince me is if there is an out-of-competition test that's unannounced, that includes blood testing and which tests for EPO. Then we can hold up our heads high and say we know there's nothing.\" The head of the Jamaican Olympic Association, Mike Fennell, rejected Wright's comments, saying he was \"being dramatic\". Fennell added: \"I think that's massively overstating it. There's no evidence to suggest that it's the tip of the iceberg.\" The Jamaican minister for sport, Natalie Neita Headley, has said more money will be put into a drug-testing programme. She said it would include blood testing, more testers and a significant increase in the number of tests. She added: \"Our athletes, as confirmed by the IAAF [world governing body], were the most tested in the world of athletics, so to say our athletes weren't tested is not exactly true.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
