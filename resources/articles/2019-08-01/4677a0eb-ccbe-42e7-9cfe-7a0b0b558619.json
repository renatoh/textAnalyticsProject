A fanatical Trump supporter, Sayoc was also a former bodybuilder and male exotic dancer. He sent 16 crude explosives to 13 intended victims across the US, prosecutors said. None of the bombs, which prosecutors called \u201cimprovised explosive devices\u201d, exploded. Sayoc\u2019s targets included the former vice-president Joe Biden, senator and Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Cory Booker, former CIA director John Brennan, former national intelligence director James Clapper, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, the New York offices of cable news network CNN, actor Robert De Niro, Democratic senator and 2020 candidate Kamala Harris, former attorney general Eric Holder, former US president Barack Obama, billionaire liberal philanthropist George Soros, Democrat presidential candidate Tom Steyer and US congresswoman Maxine Walters. Sayoc\u2019s defense lawyers urged the court to give him the minimum sentence of 10 years, describing him as a troubled man who hit a breaking point after years of untreated mental health issues and steroid addiction. As his life declined, they argued, the penniless Sayoc turned to spiritual candles and self-help books \u2013 including Trump\u2019s writing. \u201cThe books by Donald Trump really resonated with him,\u201d said defense lawyer Ian Marcus Amelkin. \u201cThen he kind of became obsessed with Donald Trump.\u201d Sayoc spent money on \u201cTrump-branded\u201d suits and ties. \u201cHe looked up to the president, as a father figure,\u201d Amelkin said. \u201cHe watched Fox News \u2026 he was expressing a lot of hateful ideas and conspiracy theories.\u201d The steroids, meanwhile, fostered obsession with Democratic party figures, Amelkin said. \u201cWe believe that the president\u2019s rhetoric contributed to Mr Sayoc\u2019s behavior,\u201d Amelkin said. Amelkin\u2019s invocation of Trump\u2019s rhetoric came in the wake of two mass shootings this weekend that left at least 31 dead. The shootings spurred renewed criticism of Trump\u2019s racist and anti-immigration rhetoric. Before the El Paso, Texas, shooting, which resulted in 22 deaths, the suspect allegedly posted a racist, anti-Hispanic screed online \u2013 which mirrored some of Trump\u2019s past statements. Prosecutors pushed for a life sentence arguing that Sayoc was aware of what he was doing and that 10 years would have been \u201cwholly insufficient\u201d. \u201cThe defendant created a climate of fear and terror,\u201d said prosecutor Jane Kim, later adding: \u201cPolitics cannot justify a terror attack.\u201d Sayoc, 57, was attentive throughout the proceeding. He wore a grey-and-blue plaid blazer and dark pants, with slicked-back hair. While both prosecutors and defense lawyers made their arguments on sentencing, Sayoc repeatedly read over several pages of the statement he would ultimately read to Rakoff. \u201cI am beyond so very sorry for what I did,\u201d said Sayoc, who traced each word on the paper with his finger as he read aloud. \u201cI wish more than anything I could turn back time and take back what I did.\u201d While Manhattan federal court judge Jed Rakoff was not swayed by Amelkin\u2019s arguments about Trump fostering paranoia, he felt that the devices\u2019 failure to detonate spoke to Sayoc\u2019s intent. \u201cMr Sayoc was fully capable or concocting pipe bombs capable of exploding,\u201d Rakoff said. \u201cHe hated his victims,\u201d Rakoff said, but not so much as to want them dead. Because Sayoc did not have a murderous intent, it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d for him to impose the maximum sentence \u2013 life plus 10 years, he added. Sayoc, who cried as Rakoff was issuing his decision, mouthed \u201cthank you\u201d and gestured as if in prayer. \u201cSayoc packed each IED with explosive material and glass shards that would function as shrapnel if the IED exploded,\u201d federal prosecutors in Manhattan said. \u201cSayoc also attached to the outside of each IED a picture of the intended victim marked with a red \u2018X.\u2019\u201d Sayoc previously pleaded guilty to 65 counts: 16 counts of using a weapon of mass destruction, 16 counts of interstate transportation of an explosive device, 16 counts of conveying a threat in interstate commerce, 16 counts of the illegal mailing of explosives with the intent to kill or injure another, and one count of using an explosive to commit a felony. The first of Sayoc\u2019s bombs was found in 22 October 2018, in a mailbox at Soros\u2019s New York home. A bomb addressed to Bill and Hillary Clinton was found on 23 October. On 24 October, still more bombs were discovered at the offices or homes of top Democrats. Authorities traced the parcels to south Florida. They arrested him in late October. At the time of Sayoc\u2019s arrest, he was living in a van that was covered with images of Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence. There were also images of Trump\u2019s opponents showing them with crosshairs on their faces."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
