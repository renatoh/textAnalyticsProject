Unlike Alan Lomax, who famously recorded American folk and blues with his father in the 20th century, Fussell sings the works he collects. Out of Sight is his third album of mellifluously upcycled cuts. He is now joined by a band \u2013 including pedal steel, violin and organ \u2013 who make easy-going, back-porch fare out of disparate tunes sourced from as far apart as Florida and Ireland. It\u2019s no criticism, however, because these engaging songs live anew, and this record, often about struggle, flows by with cogent musical warmth. \u201cHe\u2019d take the nickels off a dead man\u2019s eyes,\u201d runs a line about a mill foreman on Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues, previously repopularised by Pete Seeger. A dancing tune, Jubilee, is delivered with wry bittersweetness. What really elevates Fussell\u2019s record over and above worthy traditionalism, though, is its edge: Fussell is alive to the fantastical edge to a fishmonger\u2019s sales pitch, the extraordinariness of these ordinary songs. Subtle left-field touches take these pieces somewhere special, not least the instrumental 16-20."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
