Like a lot of writers, he regarded deadlines with a curious mix of excitement and trepidation, so he hid from them, like a boy cowering in a cupboard. In the end there was one deadline he could not elude. When Jonny was found dead at his home in St Georges Street, Ipswich, on 23 January, police estimate he had been there alone \"for a number of days\". Mutual friends say it was longer than a week, others reckon perhaps two. Piecing together the endgame of his turbulent life has proved as difficult as the man himself could often be. The moment and cause of his death remain uncertain, although the coroner's verdict was one of natural causes, and to those familiar with his lifestyle, that amounted to a result. He was 48, not particularly flush, to borrow from his betting parlance, and waiting for a call to revive his fortunes, but it never came. His last work was an unpublished book on Mike Tyson, called Scream. It would have been a fitting title for his own autobiography, and perhaps there was a subliminal message there. Jonny, who had a high-pitched, boyish laugh when happy and wore a sullen mask when down, was predisposed to anger \u2013 at the world, himself, a slow horse or a too-quick creditor. It is a wonder that, in between dips in mood and solvency, he managed to produce three books, each of them laced with passages of sustained excellence. He won the Somerset Maugham Prize for his first one, This Bloody Mary is the Last Thing I Own, which Tom Wolfe described as \"brilliant\". Tom Stoppard said of it (with his own exclamation mark), \"What a wonderful, artful book!\" While Twelve Grand, for Rachel Cugnoni at Yellow Jersey, was altogether a more fraught exercise, he finished it in the end to detail his disastrous use of his advance on gambling. (The sequel, he later joked in impecunious times, would be called Twelve Quid.) He became briefly famous off the back of it, the fleeting star of a three-part documentary on Channel 4 called The Gambler. Jonny was a big fan of Dostoyevsky and would sometimes quote the Russian's lament to his brother Mikhail after another disaster at the casino tables: \"I was carried away by this unusual good fortune and I risked all 35 napoleons and lost them all. I had 6 napoleons d'or left to pay the landlady and for the journey. In Geneva I pawned my watch.\" Finally, there was Garden Hopping, a painful tome about his search for the mother who gave him up at birth. He found her (she, too, had been adopted, as was his wife, Susie). It was not heaven-sent reunion \u2013 as he had suspected. He desperately wanted to establish his identity, but not for the first, or last time in his life, he was disappointed. Nevertheless, as he admitted later, it made for a good book. Rendall was a born and addicted writer. Those who had forgotten about, or lost contact with, this charming and hugely insecure man in the barren years of his ebbing love affair with words, were ritually sympathetic, but his death moved fewer colleagues than it might have done, given how good he was \u2013 good enough to write this: \"Kid Chocolate sat down on one of the chairs and opened his mouth to speak. But rum trickled out instead through his cracked lips stained with tobacco, like lava suddenly spewed from a long-extinct volcano. His voice when it emerged was a hoarse whisper, and he formed words with difficulty, each syllable accompanied by the widening of his eyes and a grin, as if greeting every tortured sound as an old, forgotten friend.\" Away from books (where he was more easily indulged), in the flinty world of journalism JR was not always understood or forgiven, but he deserved better than to die alone, the news scattered second and third hand in the filaments of the social media before an obituary finally landed two weeks after his death. I first heard a couple of weeks ago when I was in Melbourne, from the writer Mark Collings, whose brother Austin had been asked by a literary agent to seek a home for an obituary of Rendall. The news, which was difficult to confirm, was obviously a shock, yet strangely not so; Jonny clung to the edge of propriety for most of the 25 or so years we knew each other. Jobbing journalism was not his forte. When he was sent to America to write about a dubious heavyweight boxing tournament, he got lost in a haze of booze and struggled to file a word, aided in the end by Claude Abrams, the then editor of Boxing News. When Lennox Lewis beat Frank Bruno in Cardiff on a Friday night, Jonny only just got his report into later editions of his Sunday newspaper. Sent to Sheffield to interview the boxing trainer Brendan Ingle for another Sunday paper, he spent several days in a sauna, hiding from thugs he said were trying to beat him up. The story never appeared. Rendall wrote intermittently and with a jaundiced but knowing eye about boxing, drinking, gambling and life for this newspaper, as well as for The Times and the Independent, and those who got to know him relished his company. His drinks column for the Observer's food magazine was an engaging confection of wit, doom and fantasy, as it would be from a such a seasoned toper. For a man of strong opinions, he was unusually fatalistic. He picked a fight with life, but he was not a natural antagonist, whatever his desire to appear so, and withdrawal was usually his first option. When he and the world featherweight champion Colin McMillan flew to New York at the invitation of Don King, they were mesmerised by the promoter's long, loud entreaties to join his empire \u2013 and glad to escape unsigned. Jonny loved life, a lot and often. Yet he flirted with authority so enthusiastically he almost begged trouble to overwhelm him. When we were kept waiting in a crowded Berlin bar once, he demanded with theatrical impatience in a German accent, \"Who've I got to fuck to get a drink around here?\" In the ensuing and very brief row, the big man who had survived half a bout as an Oxford undergraduate swung at and missed a large security operative, and we laughed heartily as we were slung into the night. The night is where Jonny felt at home, it always seemed. It tugged at his imagination, a place where he could see and not be seen. By day, he was a journalist, but his forensic skills were unfocused, so like Hunter S Thompson, on whom he leaned heavily for inspiration, he preferred to shape events to the sweep of his narrative, which made him a notoriously unreliable but entertaining witness in mainstream journalism. There were few in publishing, though, who did not garland him with praise, hoping for more literary riches. Ultimately, they lost patience too. The Tyson book was his last stab. He rang me a year ago, complaining the publishers had gone cold on the project because of the disappointing end to Tyson's career several years before. That made no sense; such agony is the stuff of compelling literature, as he knew from personal experience. But he could not see it. Life, which he knew from Damon Runyon offered odds of 6-5 against, had beaten him again. We have one more gig together: a 2.15pm kick-off at Oxford Crematorium on Friday week. For God's sake, Jonny, don't be late."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
