The work-rate they put in there. Great penalties, great courage. VAR going against us. They were winners anyway going into the penalties but the way they took them showed great character.\u201d \u201cI thought we were outstanding through the game. The fight. The bravery on the ball. I\u2019m really pleased.\u201d What a terrific - and deserved - result for Derby, who came back from two goals down to knock out their Premier League hosts. Keogh converts the decisive penalty to send Derby through. Southampton 2-2 Derby (3-5) Targett scores. Southampton 2-2 Derby (3-4) Lawrence sends the keeper the wrong way and scores. Southampton 2-2 Derby (2-4) Vestergaard makes no mistake. Southampton 2-2 Derby (2-3) Mount slams it into the net off the underside of the bar. Southampton 2-2 Derby (1-3) Redmond misses, sidefotting high and wide! Southampton 2-2 Derby (1-2) Nugent send the keeper the wrong way and scores. Southampton 2-2 Derby (1-2) Ward-Prowse send the keeper the wrong way and scores. Southampton 2-2 Derby (1-1) Waghorn slams a super penalty high into the net. Southampton 2-2 Derby (0-1) Derby\u2019s Waghorn will take the first penalty. That always looked the most likely outcome after normal time. Now, anyone got Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s number to tip us off as to which way Derby\u2019s player are going to send their spotkicks? 118 min: Derby are at sixes and sevens at the back as Gallagher sprints down the right and delivers a cross. Elyounoussi fails to connect. 116 min: A kerfuffle in the Derby box after a cross from the right. The crowd chant \u201cVAR\u201d in the hope that a foul might be picked up but nothing doing. 114 min: Mount curls the freekick towards Tomori at the back post. Gunn punches it away and then Vestergaard completes the clearance. 113 min: Soares brings down Malone, giving Derby a freekick wide on the left. A prime crossing opportunity. \u201cNo matter how many changes Southampton made, as an Everton fan I\u2019m delighted that this game has gone to extra time less than 72 hours before their trip to St. Mary\u2019s,\u201d rejoices Matt Burt. And I guess they\u2019ll feel even more jaded if, after all this effort, they don\u2019t even win the game. 112 min: Redmond scampers forward again, this time darting down the left. Then he cuts on to his right foot and had a pop from 20 yards. It sails into the stands. 109 min: Romeu wins the ball in midfield and romps forward. Southampton have four v two! Romeu plays in Redmond to his right. Redmond takes a touch and then blasts it straight at the out-rushing Roos. He could have eliminated the goalkeeper by knocking the ball to a teammate to his left, or he could have finished properly but he rushed it and it\u2019s a waste. Southampton substitution: Targett on, Ramsay off. 107 min: Waghorn flips a the ball through to Lawrence, running on to it at speed 25 yards from goal. But he leans back and hoists his shot over the bar. He\u2019s better than that. 106 min: Ramsay appears to be suffering from cramp after making a fine sliding tackle on Nugent wide on the right. Penalties are looking the most likely outcome at this point, although as the teams tire a mistake could make the difference. 105+1 min: Ward-Prowse wafts a harmless freekick over the bar. Waste of time. 105 min: Freekick to Southampton, dead centre and about 30 yards out. Derby erect a wall as Ward-Prowse prepares to takes it. 104 min: Waghorn slips a nice ball through to Nugent in the box. Nugent tries to help it on to the underlapping Holmes but makes a sloppy pass. 102 min: It\u2019s all getting a bit stodgy. Play bogged down in midfield. Derby substitution: Bennett on, Wilson off. 97 min: Elyounoussi provided a lovely finessed cross for Southampton\u2019s second goal but other than that he has been very disappointing. He has just been shrugged off the ball with ridiculous ease by Holmes as the hosts launched a promising counter-attack. 96 min: Derby are looking the stronger team. That weariness detected in the Saints\u2019 ranks towards the end of normal time has resurfaced and they\u2019er being penned back at the moment. 95 min: The corner is cleared as far as Lawrence, who tries to bash it back into the net from 25 yards. Ramsay deflects it wide for another corner. Derby substitution: Holmes on, Bogle off. 94 min: Derby win a corner after a good attack. But before it can be taken they need to make a change because Bogle appears to be injured. 91 min: Off we go again. Hard to know how this is going to pan out because both teams had spells of superiority during normal time. Southampton seemed to be tiring towards the end but then, in stoppage time, perked right back up and could have won it. As in the first match Derby came back from two goals down to draw level. Extra-time to follow ... 90+4 min: Following a lovely one-two in the box, Redmond rolls the ball across the face of goal Derby\u2019s goal. Elyounoussi lunges at it but can\u2019t apply the decisive touch! 90+3 min: Derby stream forward on the counter. Waghorn pings in a cross from the left. Lawrence gets to it ahead of Vestergaard ... but heads over from six yards! 90+2 min: Freekick to Derby after a foul by Ramsay on Lawrence. Mount drifts it in to the box. It\u2019s headed clear. Wilson picks it up and tries to lash it into the net from 20 yards. No dice. 90 min: The sides have at least four minutes to find a winner and avoid extra-time ... 90 min: At the end of a sweeping move, Ramsay clips a cross from the right towards the back post, where Wilson gets in the way of an acrobatic attempt by Elyounoussi. Corner to Southampton. It\u2019s cleared. 88 min: A Derby corner is cleared and Southampton suddenly have a breakaway. But Tomori hares back to make an excellent saving challenge on Soares. 86 min: Derby are looking the more likely winners at the moment. There\u2019s a zippiness to them, while Southampton have grown a little ragged. 84 min: Redmond, ever dangerous since his introduction at half-time, darts into the opposing area before offloading to Elyounoussi, whose shot from 15 yards is badly aimed. They\u2019ve done it again! Derby complete the comeback from two goals down as Wilson curls in a cross from the right and Waghorn heads into the top corner from six yards! Now they can they get a winner? 81 min: Tomori, who\u2019s looked good at the back for Derby, cuts out a pass by Ward-Prowse intended for Gallagher. Derby substitution: Lawrence on, Huddlestone off. Wilson lines up a freekick at the right-hand corner of the Southampton box ... and curls it around the wall and into the far corner of the net! There\u2019s a pause while VAR has a gander but the ref eventually allows the goal. Are Derby about to recover from two goals down again, like they did in the first game? Derby substitution: Nugent on, Marriott off. The former Pompey player is greeted with boos by the home crowd. 74 min: Soares booked for deliberately bumping into Bogle to curtail a break. Southampton substitution: Gallagher on, Long off. No sense keeping the Irishman on now, best get him off and rest that hurt leg. He\u2019s had a decent game and made the second goal. Southampton double their lead before Derby can even stammer a reply to the first goal. And it was so easy: Stephens strode out from the back and threaded a pass through for Redmond to chase. He won the race easily and then finished with style, dinking the ball over the advancing keeper. That\u2019s why they Claude Puel called him the new Thierry Henry. Long scampers into the box and then rolls the ball through to Elyounoussi and charges to the back post to received the clipped cross. The Irishman heads past the keeper ... but Malone clears it off the line ... sonly for Armstrong to convert on the follow-up. VAR has no quibble with that one. 64 min: This time Redmond decides to do it all himself ... and he\u2019s nearly vindicated spectacularly. After a bit of jinking and ducking he unleashes a vicious shot from the left-hand corner of the box. Roos palms it behind for a corner and is relieved to do so. 62 min: Armstrong leads a breakaway attack for Southampton. Long peels off the the left and receives the ball, then tries to cross to one of his three teammates in the box. But he only finds the keeper. 60 min: A dinky turn by Wilson at the edge of the Southampton box, followed by a powerful swirling shot from over 20 yards. Gunn needs to attempts to hold it. 58 min: Tomori runs across to cover Malone and cut out a Southampton break at the expense of a corner. Then Tomori clears Ward-Prowse\u2019s delivery. 56 min: Redmond has seen a lot of the ball since his introduction and continually cuts in with it from the right but so far he has failed to produce a cutting final ball. 54 min: Southampton has perked u in the second period and now Derby are responding in kind. Keogh gets his head to a corner and forces a solid save from Gunn. 51 min: Long and Keogh chase a ball as it heads for the byline. Long gives Keogh a little shove in the back, sending him careering towards the advertising boards. Keogh manages to stop before crashing into them and then smiles as if acknowledging the top-class bantz by his Ireland teammates. 48 min: Mount receives a pass fro Huddlestone in midfield and immediately darts forward, looking for an opening. He finds one and lets fly from 25 yards but his low shot hurtles a couple of yards wide. 46 min: Southampton start as if intent on reaffirming their superiority, which they showed fleetingly at the start of the first half. Armstrong spanks a decent effort over the bar from the edge of the area after a nimble move. Long looks sprightly. Southampton substitution: Redmond on, Johnson off. Long, apparently, has overcome that leg injury that caused him to limp around for the last minutes of the first half. \u201cI thought football suffered a serious wound to its body when that penalty was given after perpetual replays in the World Cup final,\u201d blasts Drew Goldie. \u201cIt just died a little more when the Derby goal was chalked off. His arm is clearly offside, I grant you. But other than that, they\u2019re level. Surely VAR is there for - as with cricket - when the officials have made a palpable error.\u201d The position of his arm is irrelevant, of course. Still, there\u2019s something amusing about Lampard\u2019s side being thwarted by VAR on this day. I do hope the official who made the decision was is sitting in a bush. That was a so-so half in which the best moment was negated by hyper-pernickety use of Var, Bryson\u2019s fine goal chalked out for offside. Multiple replays suggest Waghorn was perhaps an inch offside in the buildup. Or perhaps not. The upshot is we\u2019re still goalless. Southampton\u2019s best chance fell to Long, who shot straight the keeper from six yards and later suffered an injury that may lead to him being replaced at half-time. 44 min: Long is back on and immediately back into the action, racing on to a through-ball. But it\u2019s apparent that he\u2019s still in pain and he offloads the ball quickly and begins hobbling again. 42 min: Long is struggling. The Irishman has suffered an injury. It\u2019s not clear how, as he appeared to feel pain as he prepared to jump for an aerial ball. There was no impact. He limps off. 38 min: Derby think they had taken the lead through a lovely goal and celebrated accordingly. Tramsay\u2019s hurried pass out from the back was intercepted and quickly used against the home side, with a Derby player fizzing a low pass into Waghorn in the middle of the box, via a dummy by Bryson. Waghorn took it under control 12 yards out and then slipped the ball into the path of Bryson, who had continued his run and finishes with a smart low shot into the bottom corner. He\u2019s engulfed by happy Derby players. But the ref asks the VAR to have a look at it. And the goal is ruled out because Waghorn was about an inch offside when he received the ball in the first place! 34 min: Armstrong overhits an attempted pass to Soares, who looks forlorn - if the ball had been good, he would have had a clear run into the box. 33 min: Derby have looked more comfortable in the last 10 minutes or so, playing more of the match in the opposing half as Southampton\u2019s early vim has dipped. After a decent move just now, Marriott forced another save from Gunn, albeit a comfortable one from a low shot from 12 yards. 30 min: A foul on Mount by Romeu gives Derby a freekick midway inside the home half. Wilson curls it into the box but it\u2019s headed clear. 27 min: Lovely, flowing move by Derby! Keogh strode out from the back and slipped a pass to Waghorn, who turned beautifully before helping it on to Wilson, who performed a similar turn and then teed up Mount for a shot from 20 yards. And that\u2019s where the move came a cropper, as Mount ballooned his shot over the bar. 24 min: Tyreke Johnson, a 20-year-old making his first senior start, looks a bright prospect out on the left wing. He\u2019s a strong and clever runner with a nice cross. 22 min: After yet more diligent pressing, Saints win the ball off Derby in midfield and work it wide to Armstrong on the left. Armstrong swings in a sweet cross and Long runs on to it and tries to guide it into the net from six yards .... but his powerful sidefooter is batted away by Roos! Excellent reactions from the keeper, but Long shouldn\u2019t have left him with any chance. 19 min: Ward-Prowse spanks a fine pass wide to the right. Soares collects it, looks up and tries to send a well-aimed cross to his men in the box. Instead he shanks it into the nearest stand. 18 min: The first booking of the match goes to Johnson for another over-zealous tackle, this time on Wilson. 16 min: IT\u2019s been a fairly even match so far. Most of the play is in Derby\u2019s half but the visitors have generally kept Southampton at bay and showed a willingness to counter-attack when possible. Neither side has looked sharp so far, however. 14 min: Bogle dodges an over-enthusiastic challenge by Johnson and darts down the right ... but then made a mess of his cross. 12 min: Now a better corner from Ward-Prowse. Stephens gets on the end of it but heads over from six yards. 10 min: Corner to Southampton after Bryson pokes the ball out of play as Elyounoussi readied a cross. Ward-Prowse delivers an out-swinger, which Derby clears effectively. 8 min: Johnson scurries down the left and sends a decent cross into the area. Again, the striker just fails to get on the end of it, in this case Long. 7 min: Mount tires to pick out Marriott with a nice low pass into the area from mid-way inside the Saints\u2019 half. But the striker, who\u2019d made a canny run, just fails to get on the end of it. 6 min: Ward-Prowse curls a freekick from the right into the Derby box. It\u2019s headed away. 4 min: Saints are playing with the dynamism Hassenh\u00fcttl has introduced, ensuring Derby have next to no time on the ball when in possession. 2 min: Huddlestone loses possession just outside his own areas as Saints\u2019 press causes bother to Derby. But they regroup and get a counter going through Mount, who helps the ball on to Wilson. He glides in from the left and feeds Waghorn, who has a bang from 20 yards. Gunn saves his low drive easily. 1 min: Off we go. The teams have arrived on the pitch. There\u2019s a fir-sized crowd at St Mary\u2019s. Derby are wearing a grey number with yellow trim, while Saints sport their familiar red and white stripe (if looking from the front, at least), albeit with a silly red drape across the shoulder. First up, he\u2019s asked whether he has any comment to make in response to Bielsa\u2019s press conference earlier today. \u201c\u201cNo. I made quite a few comments earlier in the week. I haven\u2019t seen the latest press conference. I\u2019ve been told about in general terms so maybe it\u2019s one the comment on later when I know more.\u201d Moving on to this tie, he says: \u201cI love the competition,so do the players. It\u2019s important for us. And we\u2019re searching for form. We want to win.\u201d Southampton have made five changes to the side that started their win over Leicester last weekend. Lampard, meanwhile, has confirmed what Harry Wilson\u2019s arm movements had already indicated - he has made six alterations to the team schooled at Elland Road on Friday.Harry Wilson\u2019s arm gestures made that Southampton: Gunn; Soares, Stephens, Vestergaard, Ramsay; Romeu, Ward-Prowse; Elyounoussi, Armstrong, Johnson; Long Subs: McCarthy, Bednarek, Targett, Slattery, Barnes, Redmond, Gallagher Derby: Roos; Bogle, Keogh, Tomori, Malone; Bryson, Mount, Hudlestone; Waghorn, Marriott, Wilson Subs: Carson, Lawrence Evans, Bennett, Holmes, Lowe, Nugent Hello. For those of you who are not Marcelo Bielsa, here are some basic pointers for the game ahead: Frank Lampard\u2019s team are vying with Southampton for the right to travel to Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup fourth round. This replay doesn\u2019t particularly excite the Saints manager, Ralph Hassenh\u00fcttl, who has said that the best thing about it is that it enables Charlie Austin, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Yan Valery to serve their suspensions so as to be available for this weekend\u2019s Premier League match against Everton. Southampton are also missing Michael Obafemi, Ryan Bertrand and Danny Ings through injury, while Maya Yoshida is at the Asian Cup. So Derby, who came back from 2-0 down in the first match, have a fine chance to progress today. But has their manager done his homework?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
