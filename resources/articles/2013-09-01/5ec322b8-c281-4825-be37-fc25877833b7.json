Presumably England can expect to have a bit more of the ball against Ukraine than they did in that quarter-final against Italy in Euro 2012, when they managed only 25% of possession during extra-time and it was still not the most embarrassing statistic of the night. Take your pick from the fact that James Milner managed only 13 passes throughout the entire match or that England's best passing combination was the long kick from Hart to the second-half substitute Andy Carroll, successful 15 times. The Olympic Stadium, in other words, does not hold particularly fond memories for Hodgson, even if it is also the place where England ended their undistinguished run of results against Sweden in the group stage. Hodgson, tangling himself in his own words, even conjured up the worst-case scenario for their latest assignment whereby \"from the very first kick of the game Joe Hart lets the ball through his legs\". Thankfully for England, it is unlikely, no matter how wobbly their goalkeeper has been this last year. What can be said with certainty is that Tuesday night represents the moment of truth for England in Group H \u2013 the \"cup final\", according to Hodgson, in a qualifying programme in which only one team goes through automatically to the World Cup. \"The team that wins will be in a great position,\" England's manager said. The alternative, with only two more games to come after this one, is barely worth thinking about. \"The team that loses suddenly finds their backs against the wall and the chance of winning the group taken out of their hands.\" No wonder Hodgson admitted that he felt under pressure and that \"fear plays a part in our lives\". Hodgson likened it to England's game in Italy in 1997, again with a place at the World Cup at stake, and Ukraine's coach, Mykhaylo Fomenko, offered a flavour of what to expect when he was asked whether, at the age of 64, he considered it to be the match of his life. Fomenko, with almost 50 years in the game, stared back at the questioner. \"Not only of mine,\" he replied, nodding, and the 100 or so Ukrainian journalists in the room broke into spontaneous applause. Make no mistake: they are up for this match. The din will be considerable and a lot has been made about the atmosphere England will face \u2013 probably too much. England, after all, are hardly short of experience given that Frank Lampard is about to join Steven Gerrard and Ashley Cole in the \"100 Club\". This England team are not generally short of nerve or spirit. What they really need to do is take better care of the ball and play with great concentration against dangerous opponents. Hodgson said he would be \"devastated\" if they were unprepared and his players will have a video session in the morning to go through the final details of set-piece plays. \"Having watched quite a bit of Ukraine and played against them a couple of times, they won't change,\" Gerrard said. \"They put a lot of energy into the first half-hour. They press high. They have exciting players on the wings who are very dangerous. They take the game to the opposition. They are not really set up to play defensively. It's really important we defend well in the early stages. The longer this game goes on, the better chance we have of getting the win.\" Hodgson made the same point about anticipating early pressure and, if one reads between the lines, there seems to be a suspicion on the part of the England manager and his captain that Ukraine might tire in the second half. In which case a lot depends on how England approach the game and, specifically, how much they dare push forward and leave themselves vulnerable to the counterattack. \"Good players don't plan to draw; they plan to win,\" Gerrard said. A draw, nonetheless, would be a satisfying result for England. Milner's inclusion would be a clue and, however it is dressed up, a front three also featuring Rickie Lambert and Theo Walcott is plainly not England's most formidable attack in history. Fomenko paused when he was asked what he knew about Lambert. \"It's a secret,\" he finally volunteered. The impression he left was that he did not know a great deal about the Southampton player but just did not want to admit it. No matter. Lambert's introduction to the England team, with two goals from his two caps, has been so impressive Hodgson is now starting to make the kind of statements that are normally reserved for teenagers breaking through. \"I would like, if anything, to play down Rickie Lambert, for his own sake. It is almost fairytale-like what he has done. I am just a bit worried we are going to hang a bit too much on him.\" The problem for Lambert, and England, is that Ukraine are far more refined than Scotland and Moldova."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
