Here\u2019s the key points from the first day of his tour, spent in Havana: In an \u201cintimate and familial\u201d encounter, Pope Francis and former Cuban president Fidel Castro spoke about the environment and exchanged gifts. Pope Francis gave Castro books on spirituality by priests; Castro gave the pope a book of his own insights on spirituality. Well done, El Jefe. At a papal megamass attended by thousands in Havana\u2019s Revolution Square, the pope encouraged Cubans to serve one another, noting that service is never \u201cservile\u201d or ideological, \u201cfor we do not serve ideas, we serve people\u201d. His homily was free of political messages but was nonetheless a strong statement. The liturgical music, a variation on Cuba\u2019s Danz\u00f3n, also a made a strong statement. Prominent activists told the Guardian at least 31 protesters were arrested in a \u201crepressive and aggressive\u201d move to stop them attending the mass. This included members of a women\u2019s group that campaigns for prisoner releases. On the prospect of peace in Colombia between rebels and the government, Pope Francis said we do not have the right to another failure of reconciliation. Cuban president Ra\u00fal Castro appears to have given Pope Francis the gift of a giant crucifix made out of oars. Francis went \u201cPope Unplugged\u201d for the afternoon, discarding his prepared speeches (to the chagrin of journalists and editors everywhere). He instead spoke from the heart on poverty, disability, and faith to clergy and young people. Thanks for tuning in! The blog will be running all week as the pope continues his tour through Cuba and the US. It was not as easy as you might expect to find Catholics among the crowd waiting for the pope this evening. But there was not shortage of excitements and optimism about seeing a pontiff who has played a major role in improving relations between Cuba and the United States. Many students here want to emigrate to their wealthier neighbour as soon as they graduate. Others hope that closer ties will help their own country become a more desirable place to live. \u201cI\u2019m not Catholic, but I respect the pope. He\u2019s an important man for the world and he has done a lot of good for Cuba,\u201d said 21-year-old Xavier Alexander Rodr\u00edguez, a students of computer science. \u201cYoung people in Cuba want change. The closer ties with the US are a great step towards that. I wish that we can walk like brothers with the US.\u201d Vivian Rodr\u00edguez (no relation), a 23-year-old lecturer in psychology at the University of Havana, said international support and a positive message were important for people like her who want to stay in Cuba. \u201cCubans are very excited by the arrival of the pope. We\u2019re grateful for the help he has given us in relations with other countries,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to know that there is backing for unity in Cuba and closer ties with the United States. That helps people make personal decisions (about whether to stay or go).\u201d Another update from my colleague Angela Bruno: During a brief visit to the Palace of the Revolution earlier this evening, Pope Francis was shown what appeared to be official gifts marking his visit, including a 6.5 foot crucifix of oars crafted by the Cuban artist known as Kcho, nee Alexis Leyva. In March, Kcho made international news when he turned his art studio into Cuba\u2019s first free public Wi-Fi hotspot, hoping to encourage Cubans to familiarize themselves with the Internet. It was a costly cause for the artist, who is reported to have close ties to the government. The going rate for one month of Internet service in Cuba is a whopping $900. Pope Francis put his prepared homily aside and gave an extraordinary \u201cunplugged\u201d address on poverty, mercy, disability and service to Cuba\u2019s priests, religious brothers and sisters and seminarians, during a Vespers service at Havana Cathedral. \u201cWe always try to curtail poverty, as it were,\u201d the pope said. \u201cThat\u2019s a reasonable thing, but I\u2019m talking about the heart.\u201d \u201cRichness impoverishes you; it takes away from us the best we have. It makes us poor in the only richness which is worthy: trust in God.\u201d \u201cOur holy mother church is poor. God wishes it to poor, as he wishes our holy mother Mary to be poor. Love poverty as a mother.\u201d The crowd smiled and some wiped away tears as the pontiff spoke. Cameras also caught some looks of consternation as the congregation grappled with Francis\u2019s words, especially when he (jokingly) drilled in on the struggles of some religious and priests. Nuns got it first: \u201cMay God spare us grey nuns, those who are always lamenting things! Saint Theresa used to say that to her nuns. Woe to that nun!\u201d Some nuns in the crowd (mainly the young ones) laughed. Others weren\u2019t so amused. Religious life as a consecrated brother or sister is, the pope said, about \u201cburning\u201d your life for the ones the world despises, the \u201cdisposable material\u201d of humanity. As an example, he mentioned those \u201cwho with new analytical methods, if it is discovered they have a degenerative sickness, the world wants to send them back before they are born\u201d. \u201cSometimes [a young religious sister] doesn\u2019t know how good it is to see the smile of someone who is paralysed,\u201d the pope said, smiling. \u201cThe tenderness and mercy of God is like someone who is paralysed getting saliva all over your face. Or when a person with a disability gets angry and hits you!\u201d Priests were next: \u201cPlease to the priests,\u201d the holy father said, \u201cdo not grow tired of forgiving.\u201d \u201cDo not hide in fears or rigidities. Be like this nun [Sister Ponce, who spoke earlier in the service about her ministry], and those who are here. They are not angry when they find the sick person filthy; they just clean him. When the penitent comes to you, don\u2019t feel bad. Don\u2019t be neurotic. Jesus embraced them. Jesus loved them.\u201d \u201cNo corporation can be made, no money can be made from the least ones. In that place Jesus shines brightly,\u201d the pope said. The pope says he will give his printed homily to one of the cardinals to distribute and is going to speak off the cuff. This regular journalist quietly screams. Thanks, Frank. The chanted psalms are sung beautifully by a choir. The pope is saving his voice, by the look of it. Just a little church fact you might find interesting: the Catholic church\u2019s communal prayer is the same around the world each day. I heard the same readings at mass this morning in New York as the pope heard in Havana, and in every other parish in the world. In a sense, it\u2019s like the church prays for you. That\u2019s especially true of what\u2019s called the Divine Office, the daily schedule of prayer, because few lay people perform it. Here\u2019s the relevant bit for this particular service. A Daughter of Charity, Sr Yaileny Ponce, speaks to the pope. She is is pouring her heart out about her ministry with the severely disabled. \u201cI have to discern in a shout or a cry or a scream: Joy? Or pain?\u201d \u201c[It\u2019s] beautiful because there, in his weakest children, God lives and shows himself.\u201d \u201cIt is worth giving your life to serve these people because in them you find the kingdom of God.\u201d The congregation applauds her, and the pope begins the formal liturgical element of the service. The Archbishop of Havana, Jaime Lucas Ortega, prays for renewal in the church. This feels like more of an internally-focused service for the church itself. Francis arrives at the Cathedral of Havana to applause and cheers. Religious sisters and priests are kissing his ring. It looks really hot in there. You can tune in here if you\u2019d like to watch. Some video of activists at this morning\u2019s mass is floating around online now While we wait for the Pope to celebrate Vespers (evening prayer), internet Jesuit Fr James Martin has been pointing out a few howlers under the #PapalGoofs hashtag. Here\u2019s a striking image via the Associate Press Instagram feed \u2013 a Cuban woman holds an image of the Virgin of Charity of Cobre, the patroness of Cuba. Pope Francis makes an unscheduled stop off at Havana\u2019s Jesuit parish on his way to Vespers with the priests and religious of Cuba. When he arrives at the cathedral, he is rumored to be preparing to meet dissidents, Vatican insiders report: The Cuban ministry of foreign affairs has compiled a gallery of previous papal visits, Angela Bruno writes, including snaps of Fidel Castro and Pope John Paul II in 1998, new shots of Pope Francis and Raul Castro, and more showing the preparations that went into this historic visit. The minstry\u2019s own Flickr Photostream is worth keeping an eye on. More from Stephanie Kirchgaessner on the significance of the gifts given to Fidel Castro: The gift of Llorente\u2019s book would likely have particular significance for Castro. Llorente was the revolutionary leader\u2019s teacher at the Colegio de Belen in 1940s but left the country in 1961. He died in Miami in 2010, at the age of 91. According to a 2006 interview with Llorente in the Miami Herald, the Jesuit recalled how a teenage Fidel, whose father Angel was largely absent from his life, once confided in him \u201cI have no family other than you\u201d. He was apparently referring to the Jesuit priests who were educating him. Llorente also recalled visiting Castro\u2019s guerrilla camp in 1958, when the Batista government was close to falling. \u201cI went because the Vatican needed to know what was happening. Was the revolution Fidel was leading nationalist, or Marxist, or what?\u201d the priest said, according to the report. He added: \u201cI spent four days at Fidel\u2019s headquarters. I asked him about Cuba\u2019s future, especially regarding the Catholic Church. He professed to have no problem and said, for example, that he would need to keep the Catholic Saint Thomas University so that it could train the engineers that Cuba needed so badly.\u2019\u2019 Guardian contributor Anita Chabria checks in again from San Francisco: The pink-walled chapel of St Peter\u2019s Cathedral in the Latino neighborhood of San Francisco is full but hushed, as pilgrims await the arrival of Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone. The Spanish-speaking faithful are here to honor more than 100 parishioners heading east to Washington DC on Tuesday, where they\u2019ll witness the canonization of Junipero Serra, father of California\u2019s Catholic mission system Serra is a controversial figure who is credited for spreading the faith in this state, but whom many Native Americans say bears responsibility for the thousands of their ancestors who died in those missions. But for those included in the journey to see his sainthood, it\u2019s exciting to be a part of this papal visit to the United States. \u201cIt will be fun,\u201d says Hortencia Angotti, here with her daughter and mother, who is going with other members of her family. When its his turn to speak, Cordileone leaves his chair on the dias and walks down the stairs in his long green robes to address the congregation up close. Hs manner is conversational, he gesticulates to punctuate his speech, his Spanish easy and fluent. He has preached mass here numerous times, and is described as humble and straightforward. Across town in the more affluent enclaves he is often seen as overly conservative and unwelcoming of diversity within the church. \u201cI think [the archbishop] likes it here,\u201d says Oscar Avila, who has been a member of this congregation since he was 10 years old. Some more shots of the pope with Ra\u00fal Castro. Pope Francis has met President Ra\u00fal Castro at the Revolution Palace. I\u2019m watching the stream on EWTN Catholic news and the commentators think this scene of the two looks more like a confession than a state visit. I\u2019ll leave that judgment up to you (apologies for the grainy screenshot). More from my colleague Angela Bruno: According to the Pope\u2019s biographer Austen Ivereigh, the last line of the Pontiff\u2019s homily this morning \u2013 \u201cWhoever does not live to serve, does not \u2018serve\u2019 to live\u201d \u2013 is a nod to Mother Teresa, who made visited Cuba in 1986 . In an unscheduled meeting with Fidel Castro, the Albanian nun, persuaded him to allow the Missionary Sisters of Charity to establish a mission in Cuba. Pope John Paul II\u2019s in 1998 ultimately resulted in Christmas and Good Friday being declared public holidays in Cuba again. From Havana, Jon Watts: I just spoke to Angel Moya, a prominent activist who said at least 31 people were detained this morning to prevent them from attending the pope\u2019s mass. \u201cThey are the ones we know of, but we are still counting,\u201d he said. Moya was among them. After being held in a police station from 5am to 11:30, he said he was picked up along with his wife, Berta Soler \u2013 the leader of the Damas do Blanco (Ladies in White) group that campaigns for prisoner releases. With more than 20 other activists from the group who were gathered ahead of their planned journey to Revolution Square, when the police moved in with what he described as a \u201crepressive, aggressive operation that was specifically targeted to prevent us from attending the public mass.\u201d His said his wife had also been detained the previous evening on her way to the Vatican embassy, where the pope is lodging during his stay in Havana. He said she had been invited by the church authorities. Moya \u2013 who was imprisoned for eight years \u2013 expressed disappointment that pope Francis has ignored the state\u2019s actions, unlike his predecessor John Paul II who visited in 1998. \u201cJohn Paul spoke out clearly, but the current pope is too soft with regards to human rights. Cubans have a harsh life, but he has not been categorical enough when talking about civil liberties. He must have known what happened to us, but he didn\u2019t address the issue.\u201d He said the group had no further actions planned during the pope\u2019s visit, but they would continue their campaign. \u201cWe\u2019ll defend our rights with or without the pope. He is no liberator. It is up to Cubans to struggle for our liberty.\u201d From Guardian contributor Anita Chabria in San Francisco: The Immaculate Conception de Nicaragua (the national patroness of Nicaragua) being set up in preparation for a special mass by San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone at Saint Peter\u2019s in the mission, a Latino working class church in a neighborhood that has so far escaped gentrification. Archbishop Cordileone will bless the congregation going east this week for the canonization of Junipero Serra on Wednesday. The canonization is controversial for Native Americans, some of whom have compared the colonial-era frontier priest to Hitler and the conquistadors. Cordileone is a divisive figure too. High-profile Catholics in his archdiocese placed a full-page advertisement calling for the pope to remove him, after his hardline views allegedly \u201cfostered an atmosphere of division and intolerance\u201d. And here are the pilgrims: More pope emojis ... this time in .gif form Ouch. Ivereigh on the choice of gifts: Googling around to find out more about Fr Alessandro Pronzato, whose books the pope gave to Fidel Castro, I found this little gem from his book, Meditations on the Sand. I wonder what El Jefe would make of it: These days there is a great deal of talk about the \u201crediscovery of one\u2019s identity.\u201d But they seem to be talking about an identity which is imposed on the individual by society. It is predetermined and unalterable. You have found your identity if if you \u201cresemble\u201d the model which has already been decided for you. The search for one\u2019s identity then ends in slavery, not freedom. For you do not become what you are called to be, but what society wants you to be. In the context of the search for identity, prayer is a subversive factor rather than a consolidating element ... People who pray are eccentric because they go outside the circles of brainwashing and conformism. And this from papal biographer Austen Ivereigh, who must be fielding a hundred questions a minute: And a few more details from Vatican Insider: At the end of his meeting with Ratzinger back in 2012, Castro had asked the then Pope to recommend him a book to read. Francis remembered this and brought him two books by Don Alessandro Pronzato, a priest and catechesis expert: the first is about good mood and joy as important elements of spiritual life and the second, titled \u201cLa nostra bocca si apr\u00ec al sorriso. Umorismo e fede\u201d (\u201cOur mouth opened up to smiling. Humour and faith\u201d) and the second is titled \u201cVangeli scomodi\u201d (\u201cUncomfortable Gospels\u201d). My colleague Stephanie Kirchgaessner has filed a longer report on the meeting between Fidel Castro and Pope Francis. In it, she notes that the meeting had a markedly different tone from the ageing Cuban leader\u2019s last pontifical t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate: [Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi] also suggested that the meeting had a different tone than one in 2012 between Castro and Francis\u2019s predecessor, Pope Benedict. In that encounter, Castro allegedly peppered the German pope with questions, while on Sunday, Castro engaged in more of a conversation with Francis. Reconciliation between the US and Cuba is high on the agenda for Pope Francis\u2019s tour, and it\u2019s an aim supported by the public in both the US and Latin America. In a recent Pew Research Centre survey, support for re-establishing diplomatic relations rated 73% among those polled in the US and a median of 77% in Latin American countries. Ending the trade embargo polled 72% and 76% respectively. Mexicans (at 55%) were the outliers on the embargo question; Argentinian, Brazilian, Chilean and Venezuelans were also polled. Interestingly, US respondents were more likely to believe that Cuba would not become more democratic over the next few years when compared to counterparts in Latin America. You can read more at Pew\u2019s website, here. Meanwhile, in the US ... My colleague Angela Bruno has been reading an article on the pope\u2019s outspoken views on capitalism by the Miami Herald/Nuevo Herald columnist Andres Oppenheimer: Oppenheimer cites the work of the economist Ricardo Hausmann, the director of the Center for International Development at Harvard University, whose article Does Capitalism Cause Poverty? took issue with the pope\u2019s critique of capitalism. (You may remember that during a speech in Bolivia this past July, he referred to unbridled capitalism as the \u201cdung of the devil\u201d. In his article, Haussmann asks: \u201cShould an agenda to advance social justice be based on bridling capitalism or on eliminating the barriers that thwart its expansion? The answer in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia is obviously the latter.\u201d Speaking to Oppenheimer, Haussman said: \u201cThe main problem is not exploitation, but exclusion,\u201d arguing that the main cause of poverty in Latin America is \u201cthe millions [of people] who work under the informal economy that don\u2019t receive any of those formal benefits.\u201d Oppenheimer also quotes Jos\u00e9 Casanova, a professor of the sociology of religion at Georgetown University, whose stance offers a healthy dose of now-let\u2019s-take-it-easy. \u201cHe\u2019s not anti-capitalist \u2026 He\u2019s simply saying that the system sometimes puts [monetary] gain ahead of the common good.\u201d Oppenheimer concludes: \u201cThe pope does well to talk about the poor of the world, and he is also right to criticise capitalism taken to its extreme. However, in his recent visit to Bolivia, he spoke of the latter without mentioning the excesses of anti-capitalist countries which have created more poverty and more oppression than any other.\u201d You can read the whole piece (in Spanish) here. Episcopalian priest Father Alberto Cuti\u00e9, in El Nuevo Herald, the largest-circulation Spanish-language Sunday paper in the US, puts the \u201cMiami Cuban\u201d perspective. Cuti\u00e9 is a well-known former Catholic priest and the son of Cuban exiles. He has written in Spanish, but here\u2019s an excerpt in translation: Why do you and other religious leaders so strongly condemn capitalism ... but we never see an equally strong condemnation of atheistic communism, which continues to do so much damage in the world? ... I believe that the Church of Christ has to be more connected and concerned about the people and not so close to the oppressor. Jon Watts checks in from Cuba: We\u2019re now at one of several intriguing points in the pope\u2019s schedule that are simply described as \u201cprivate\u201d. Since he is unlikely to be simply sitting alone and tucking into a plate of arroz con pollo, these are the parts of the programme that are open to the grandest speculation. He has already met Fidel Castro. The remaining possibilities for free time are many: a frank discussion of human rights with Ra\u00f9l, meetings with dissidents, planning the next steps for reconciliation with the US, discussions about who should be the next Cuban cardinal, a briefing on the Colombian peace talks in Havana or a chat with Cristina Kirchner, the Argentinian president, about the forthcoming election. All or none of the above are \u2013 to varying degrees \u2013 conceivable. But we probably won\u2019t know for some time how this wily pontiff has been using his time. And spare a thought for the Vatican reporters... Another group of ladies in white \u2013 not protesters this time. Jonathan Watts is in Havana and has filed a comprehensive report on the morning\u2019s proceedings: Given the location and those in attendance, [Pope Francis\u2019s] message could be taken as an address to power. Apart from the giant images of Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos, the square is as much the centre of government as of revolution. You can read the full report here: Pope Francis met former Cuban president Fidel Castro after his mass in Havana and exchanged gifts, the Vatican has confirmed. The meeting lasted for around 30-40 minutes, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi told reporters. The mood was was \u201cinitimate and familial\u201d, Lombardi said. The two discussed the environment and \u201cthe situation of humanity today, the great problems\u201d. The pope gave Castro a copy of his environmental encyclical, Laudato Si, and books by Italian priest Alessandro Pronzato and Spanish Jesuit Segundo Llorente, who educated the former Cuban leader. A book on humour and religion was also given to Castro, now 89. In return, he presented the pope with his own religious insights: a collection of interviews with Castro by the Brazilian priest Frei Betto. Some reaction to the pope\u2019s comments on the Colombian peace talks, thanks to our correspondent in Bogot\u00e1, Sibylla Brodzinsky: President Juan Manuel Santos tweeted a message of thanks to the pontiff, adding: \u201cWe will continue on the road of peace and reconciliation.\u201d Meanwhile, the AFP news agency reported that negotiators from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, Farc, had requested a meeting with the pope during his three-night visit to Cuba. That meeting doesn\u2019t appear on the pope\u2019s agenda, but one Farc commander said that the pope\u2019s comments would strengthen the peace process. \u201cWe\u2019re sure many people (in Colombia) now see the peace-building process with more hope,\u201d said commander Pastor Alape, a negotiator for the leftist guerrilla group. Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez, one of the rebels\u2019 most senior commanders also tweeted in response to the pope\u2019s comments: \u201cAs the Pope says, we cannot allow ourselves any more failures on the road to peace and reconciliation. We need a society at peace.\u201d Valentina Alazraki, Vatican correspondent for Mexico\u2019s Televisa, is reporting on Twitter that Pope Francis has met behind closed doors with Fidel Castro. A new poll from the Washington Post on US attitudes toward the pope shows that while the pontiff is widely liked in the US, the church attracts less approval. A majority of US Catholics, WaPo reports, are now \u201csaying that the church is in touch with them \u2014 a reversal from two years ago, when 6 in 10 said the church was out of sync\u201d. 70% of those polled said they had a favourable view of the pope, compared to 55% when asked about the church. For Catholics alone, the response was more even: 81% for the church and 86% for the pope. Weekly mass-going Catholics rated higher. While popular across the board, political conservatives were less likely to approve of Francis than liberals. 74% of those with no religion approved of Francis, while merely 38% approved of the church he leads. You can read the full poll here. My colleague Angela Bruno has some more updates on the detention of anti-government activists: The Miami-based group Human Rights in Cuba is now reporting that the 17 detained members of the opposition group Damas en Blanco have been released, including their leader, Berta Soler. (So far, neither the Damas or Soler have confirmed this.) And others may still not have been released. The activist and blogger Yoani S\u00e1nchez tweeted a link to a story suggesting that \u201cdozens\u201d were detained and that the real number could exceed 30. On their Twitter feed, the Ladies in White linked to an article in the Madrid-based Diario de Cuba in which a source close to the Archbishop of Havana said that even street vendors have been instructed to challenge any anti-government presence. And here\u2019s an interesting tidbit spotted by Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Rome: Cuban state-run website Cubadebate has changed the logos on its homepage and Twitter account in honor of Pope Francis\u2019s visit. The usual logo consisting of red and black semicircles and white arrows has been replaced by a graphic representation of the tall papal headgear known as the mitre, emblazoned with a cross. It\u2019s accompanied by the words \u201cWelcome to Cuba\u201d, in Spanish, in place of Cubadebate\u2019s usual tagline: \u201cAgainst Media Terrorism.\u201d If there\u2019s anything you can say about Pope Francis, it\u2019s that he\u2019s extremely photogenic. Here\u2019s a gallery of photos from the Havana mass. In his Angelus prayers after the conclusion of mass, Pope Francis continued to pray for peace in Colombia between the leftist Farc rebels and the government of President Juan Manuel Santos, warning that failure is not an option. Here\u2019s the text: At this time I feel bound to direct my thoughts to the beloved land of Colombia, \u201cconscious of the crucial importance of the present moment when, with renewed effort and inspired by hope, its sons and daughters are seeking to build a peaceful society\u201d. May the blood shed by thousands of innocent people during long decades of armed conflict, united to that of the Lord Jesus Christ crucified, sustain all the efforts being made, including those on this beautiful island, to achieve definitive reconciliation. Thus may the long night of pain and violence, with the support of all Colombians, become an unending day of concord, justice, fraternity and love, in respect for institutions and for national and international law, so that there may be lasting peace. Please, we do not have the right to allow ourselves yet another failure on this path of peace and reconciliation. I ask you now to join with me in praying to Mary, that we may place all our concerns and hopes before the heart of Christ. We pray to her in a special way for those who have lost hope and find no reasons to keep fighting, and for those who suffer from injustice, abandonment and loneliness. We pray for the elderly, the infirm, children and young people, for all families experiencing difficulty, that Mary may dry their tears, comfort them with a mother\u2019s love, and restore their hope and joy. Holy Mother, I commend to you these your sons and daughters in Cuba. May you never abandon them! And for the big picture, check out Ed Vulliamy\u2019s report won the prospects for peace in the Observer. OK! As they say at the end of mass, \u201cGo in peace and serve the Lord\u201d. And that\u2019s what Pope Francis will be doing for the rest of today. I\u2019ll just be serving you, loyal PopeBlog readers, which is just as good. This afternoon, the pontiff will make a \u201ccourtesy visit\u201d to the Palacio de la Revoluci\u00f3n, and will celebrate Vespers (evening prayer) with priests, religious brothers and sisters, and seminarians. He will also meet with young people at the Father Felix Varela cultural centre. Varela, a Cuban priest who died in the mid-19th century, is significant for both the US and Cuba (he served in New York city as vicar-general). Anyway, let us know what you thought of Pope Francis\u2019s homily (or that amazing music!) in the thread below \u2013 see you there. If you\u2019re just joining us on the Guardian\u2019s PopeBlog, the pontiff has celebrated a mass in Havana\u2019s Revolution Square with thousands of Cubans and the presidents of Cuba and Argentina, Ra\u00fal Castro and Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. His homily, focused on service and not explicitly political, carried a strong message for the Cuban state: This caring for others out of love is not about being servile ... Service is never ideological, for we do not serve ideas, we serve people. At least three protesters, who appeared to be distributing leaflets, were arrested, AP reported. The pope also gave first holy communion to five Cuban children, an important rite of passage for young Catholics. My colleague Angela Bruno has some more on the apparent crackdown on Cuban dissidents during the papal visit. Berta Soler, leader of the Ladies in White \u2013 an opposition group campaigning for the freedom of their jailed family members \u2013 tweeted last night that she and her husband \u00c1ngel Moya had been prevented from reaching the Vatican\u2019s diplomatic mission in Havana by agents of the Department of State Security. This morning she tweeted: \u201cIf we are not at the bus terminal at 7am, it is because we have been disappeared.\u201d Las Damas de Blanco were notably absent from this morning\u2019s historic mass. A message on their Twitter account directed at the pope read: @Pontifex_es Father, I am watching the mass on TV, but the @DamasdeBlanco can\u2019t even do that \u2013 they\u2019ve been arrested for wanting to attend your homily Twitter user @ailermaria said that the activist Agust\u00edn L\u00f3pez was being held in the Cerro police station after been \u201carrested and beaten\u201d with Ladies in White member Ada Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez when they attempted to enter Revolution Square. Others dissidents described detentions and communications being cut off: While #PapaenCuba starts his mass in La Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n, opposition activists @DamasdeBlanco have been detained so they can not attend. Their phones have been cut off Las Damas de Blanco aren\u2019t the only group affected by these arrests. Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer, leader of Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica de Cuba (UNPACU), a human rights advocacy group, said Friday that members of his group have also been detained. According to UNPACU, they suspect those arrested will be detained until Pope Francis and foreign journalists leave Cuba after all scheduled events and appearances. Is the pope a communist? Rome correspondent Stephanie Kirchgaessner writes: If Pope Francis does meet with Fidel Castro, as is expected, it is likely to spur another debate about whether the Argentinian pope is a communist. It\u2019s an interesting question given the pope\u2019s very pointed and frequent criticisms of capitalism. But most experts agree that the pope cannot accurately be labeled. In July, Kevin Clarke, senior editor of America magazine, a Catholic publication, had this to say in the Washington Post: The pope is not a Marxist; he is not any sort of political revolutionary ... Pope Francis is not interested in changing political or economic systems, but in changing hearts, in acts of personal conversion that can lead to social transformation. That said, it is also true that the church in the age of Francis has experienced a resurgence in some tenets of liberation theology, a Latin American movement that focused on care for the poor. Before he was pope, Francis was a sometime critic of the Marxist strands of liberation theology and some leftist regimes in Latin America. As papal biographer Austen Ivereigh told the Guardian: \u201cHe had a phrase he used \u2013 that they were for the people but never with them.\u201d More on liberation theology here. And with a final send-off from that incredible choir, the pope departs for his next engagement, saying goodbye to Cuban president Ra\u00fal Castro and the president of Argentina, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. This has been such a hallmark of Francis\u2019s pontificate: from his very first moment, he has asked Catholics to pray for him. From Bogot\u00e1, a dispatch on Colombia from Sibylla Brodzinsky, whose peace process Francis remarked upon in his final words to the congregation. Colombia\u2019s leftist Farc rebels and the government of President Juan Manuel Santos are engaged in peace negotiations aimed at ending the Western hemisphere\u2019s longest-running war, which has killed more than 200,000. The peace talks are being held in Havana and Farc leaders had hoped the pope would agree to meet with negotiators from both sides during his visit to Cuba. But the Vatican denied that a meeting would take place. Pope Francis has repeatedly mentioned Colombia\u2019s peace talks in his masses, andwhen Santos visited the Vatican in June \u2013 at a moment when the negotiations seemed in peril \u2013 the pontiff told the Colombian president that he was praying \u201ca lot, a lot for the peace process\u201d. During the pope\u2019s Latin American tour in July, which did not include Colombia, he said the Catholic Church was \u201cwilling to help in so many ways\u201d to see the peace talks through. The mass has ended! Pope Francis makes some final remarks, praying for the congregation to be able to endure the suffering ahead. \u201cWe don\u2019t have room for another failure on this path to reconciliation.\u201d On an unrelated note, here\u2019s some more popemobile footage for the revheads out there. Cardinal Jaime Ortega, archbishop of Havana, thanks the Pope for his visit, and for his love and generosity toward the Cuban people. If you need to go grab a cup of coffee or a beer or something, now\u2019s the time. With thousands upon thousands of people there, distributing all these communion hosts will take a while. While Cuba is nominally a Catholic country, only some 5% of Catholics regularly attend mass. It\u2019s a good point. Really, I don\u2019t have any excuses for my jetlag, given the pope\u2019s age. Pope Francis administers first communion to five Cuban children. During this visit there has been a lot of \u201cNew Evangelization\u201d \u2013 new media and fresh approaches to reaching people. I\u2019ve been seeing these little pope emojis around online over the last few days. Members of the congregation offer each other the sign of peace \u2013 usually a handshake or a kiss on the cheek. By this stage they\u2019re probably glad for a chance to get up and move around! Pope Francis sings the doxology: \u201cThrough him and with him and in him\u201d. Luckily the choir comes in afterwards with a rousing amen ... perhaps the Holy Father is more of a dancer. From my colleague Angela Bruno: If the crowds were not moved enough by Pope Francis\u2019 words on service, they were most certainly moved by the Cuban danz\u00f3n music roaring through La Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n during the mass. Mass (with danz\u00f3n) at La Plaza de la Revolucion: God is not dead, he dances. A danz\u00f3n that\u2019s almost like a cha cha cha at the mass. Peace is born from justice. There\u2019s a common phrase that we all understand: \u201cTo dance a danz\u00f3n, two are needed.\u201d Do we all agree? Now the rite of Holy Communion. Pope Francis is consecrating the bread and wine to become, Catholics believe, the body and blood of Jesus Christ. After singing and cheering as the pope\u2019s drove by, a reverent hush fell over the crowd as mass got underway. Everyone is standing. They are going to need stamina for this service, which is scheduled to last two hours. With sun now breaking out, it is going to be hot. It will be tough, especially for those who have been here since midnight. But the mood is joyful. \u201cI never imagined I\u2019d see this day,\u201d said Ramon Estevez, an engineer who is here with his wife. \u201cI\u2019m very happy I can be here as a Catholic.\u201d I have talked to several people who said they were also at the masses given by St John Paul II and Benedict. Opinions are divided about whether the crowds are bigger this time but everyone said they had higher expectations of Francis because he is Latin American or because he has played a role in brokering closer ties with the US. Crowds are big, but not as huge as many expected. Partly, I guess, because Cuba has a relatively modestly sized population and is less Catholic than other countries in the region. Fidel Castro certainly drew more, but then he also had the state to mobilize his audience. You\u2019re not the only one, Diana! Is that a danz\u00f3n beat? Now the prayers. Some of these are very sweet: For the whole church, for the pope, for all the bishops for them to evangelize what jesus teaches us with simplicity and humility in the hands of god. Let us pray for all the priests and religious, who have Christ at the center of their lives, to work tirelessly to serve their brothers and sisters Holy Father, we present Cuba nd those that have the destiny of the island in their hands so that we can build a country prosperous and happy. All our families, the captive, the old, the young, may they find in their path merciful people. We put in God\u2019s house our children \u2013 so that they may grow learning to do good in their lives. The homily Pope Francis has just delivered centers one of the major themes of his papacy: service to others, particularly the weakest among us. He emphasized that \u2013 even as Jesus\u2019s disciples argued over who would have the \u201chighest place\u201d among them, who would be \u201cabove the common law\u201d \u2013 Jesus taught that an authentic life was one based on the \u201cconcrete commitment to our neighbor.\u201d Christians are constantly called to set aside their own wishes and desires, their pursuit of power, and to look instead to those who are most vulnerable. There is a kind of \u201cservice\u201d which truly \u201cserves\u201d, yet we need to be careful not to be tempted by another kind of service, a \u201cservice\u201d which is \u201cself-serving\u201d,\u201d Francis said. In a message that can be seen as having particular resonance in both communist Cuba and capitalist US, he added: \u201cService is never ideological, for we do not serve ideas, we serve people.\u201d From AP: Cuban security personnel have detained at least three people who appeared to be trying to distribute leaflets ahead of Pope Francis\u2019s Mass in Havana\u2019s Revolution Square. The officials dragged them away and picked up the flyers that were left on one of the streets surrounding the plaza. It\u2019s not clear what the protest was about. The three were in white T-shirts and were yelling before they were tackled and dragged away. Pope Francis called Cubans to serve each other in a way that was not ideological or servile, during his homily at the Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f2n before an assembled crowd of thousands. This caring for others out of love is not about being servile,\u201d the Pope said, in his homily, which was free of explicit political references. \u201cRather, it means putting our brothers and sisters at the center. Service always looks to their faces, touches their flesh, senses their closeness and even, in some cases, \u2019suffers\u2019 in trying to help. Service is never ideological, for we do not serve ideas, we serve people.\u201d And from my colleague Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Rome: Vatican experts have said that Pope Francis \u2013 and indeed the church \u2013 are approaching this trip to Cuba mindful that the nation lies at a crossroads, and that some of the values that were enshrined in the 1959 revolution ought not to be weakened at this time of reconciliation with the US. In his homily, Francis asked for the \u201cfaithful people in Cuba\u201d to care for their \u201cvocation of grandeur\u201d. He said: \u201cToday I ask you to care for this vocation of yours, to care for these gifts which God has given you, but above all I invite you to care for and be at the service of the frailty of your brothers and sisters. Do not neglect them for plans which can be seductive, but are unconcerned about the face of the person beside you\u201d. The Gospel shows us Jesus asking a seemingly indiscreet question of his disciples: \u201cWhat were you discussing along the way?\u201d It is a question which he could also ask each of us today: \u201cWhat do you talk about every day?\u201d \u201cWhat are your aspirations?\u201d The Gospel tells us that the disciples \u201cdid not answer because on the way they had been arguing about who was the most important\u201d. The disciples were ashamed to tell Jesus what they were talking about. As with the disciples then, we too can be caught up in these same arguments: who is the most important? Jesus does not press the question. He does not force them to tell him what they were talking about on the way. But the question lingers, not only in the minds of the disciples, but also in their hearts. Who is the most important? This is a life-long question to which, at different times, we must give an answer. We cannot escape the question; it is written on our hearts. I remember more than once, at family gatherings, children being asked: \u201cWho do you love more, Mommy or Daddy\u201d? It\u2019s like asking them: \u201cWho is the most important for you?\u201d But is this only a game we play with children? The history of humanity has been marked by the answer we give to this question. Jesus is not afraid of people\u2019s questions; he is not afraid of our humanity or the different things we are looking for. On the contrary, he knows the \u201ctwists and turns\u201d of the human heart, and, as a good teacher, he is always ready to encourage and support us. As usual, he takes up our searching, our aspirations, and he gives them a new horizon. As usual, he somehow finds an the answer which can pose a new challenge, setting aside the \u201cright answers\u201d, the standard replies we are expected to give. As usual, Jesus sets before us the \u201clogic\u201d of love. A mindset, an approach to life, which is capable of being lived out by all, because it is meant for all. Far from any kind of elitism, the horizon to which Jesus points us is not for those few privileged souls capable of attaining the heights of knowledge or different levels of spirituality. The horizon to which Jesus points us always has to do with daily life, also here on \u201cour island\u201d, something which can season our daily lives with eternity. Who is the most important? Jesus is straightforward in his reply: \u201cWhoever wishes to be the first among you must be the last of all, and the servant of all\u201d. Whatever wishes to be great must serve others, not be served by others. Here lies the great paradox of Jesus. The disciples were arguing about who would have the highest place, who would be chosen for privileges, who would be above the common law, the general norm, in order to stand out in the quest for superiority over others. Who would climb the ladder most quickly to take the jobs which carry certain benefits. Jesus upsets their \u201clogic\u201d, their mindset, simply by telling them that life is lived authentically in a concrete commitment to our neighbor. The call to serve involves something special, to which we must be attentive. Serving others chiefly means caring for their vulnerability. Caring for the vulnerable of our families, our society, our people. Theirs are the suffering, fragile and downcast faces which Jesus tells us specifically to look at and which he asks us to love. With a love which takes shape in our actions and decisions. With a love which finds expression in whatever tasks we, as citizens, are called to perform. People of flesh and blood, people with individual lives and stories, and with all their frailty: these are those whom Jesus asks us to protect, to care for, to serve. Being a Christian entails promoting the dignity of our brothers and sisters, fighting for it, living for it. That is why Christians are constantly called to set aside their own wishes and desires, their pursuit of power, and to look instead to those who are most vulnerable. There is a kind of \u201cservice\u201d which truly \u201cserves\u201d, yet we need to be careful not to be tempted by another kind of service, a \u201cservice\u201d which is \u201cself-serving\u201d. There is a way to go about serving which is interested in only helping \u201cmy people\u201d, \u201cour people\u201d. This service always leaves \u201cyour people\u201d outside, and gives rise to a process of exclusion. All of us are called by virtue of our Christian vocation to that service which truly serves, and to help one another not to be tempted by a \u201cservice\u201d which is really \u201cself-serving\u201d. All of us are asked, indeed urged, by Jesus to care for one another out of love. Without looking to one side or the other to see what our neighbor is doing or not doing. Jesus tells us: Whoever would be first among you must be the last, and the servant of all\u201d. He does not say: if your neighbor wants to be first, let him be the servant! We have to be careful to avoid judgmental looks and renew our belief in the transforming look to which Jesus invites us. This caring for others out of love is not about being servile. Rather, it means putting our brothers and sisters at the center. Service always looks to their faces, touches their flesh, senses their closeness and even, in some cases, \u201csuffers\u201d in trying to help. Service is never ideological, for we do not serve ideas, we serve people. God\u2019s holy and faithful people in Cuba is a people with a taste for parties, for friendship, for beautiful things. It is a people which marches with songs of praise. It is a people which has its wounds, like every other people, yet knows how to stand up with open arms, to keep walking in hope, because it has a vocation of grandeur. Today I ask you to care for this vocation of yours, to care for these gifts which God has given you, but above all I invite you to care for and be at the service of the frailty of your brothers and sisters. Do not neglect them for plans which can be seductive, but are unconcerned about the face of the person beside you. We know, we are witnesses of the incomparable power of the resurrection, which \u201ceverywhere calls forth the seeds of a new world\u201d (cf. Evangelii Gaudium, 276, 278). Let us not forget the Good News we have heard today: the importance of a people, a nation, and the importance of individuals, which is always based on how they seek to serve their vulnerable brothers and sisters. Here we encounter one of the fruits of a true humanity. \u201cWhoever does not live to serve, does not \u2018serve\u2019 to live\u201d. The pope will today be offering first communion to five Cuban children, according to the Vatican.This is the first time the pope is offering this sacrament on a foreign trip. This gesture is seen as a symbol of hope and the growth of the church in Cuba. It really is incredible how a huge crowd can fall into silence at a papal mega-mass. Extraordinary. Now the Gospel is sung. It\u2019s from Mark. They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he would not have any one know it; for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, \u201cThe Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he will rise.\u201d But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to ask him. A young woman gives the first reading, which is from the Book of Wisdom. Let us lie in wait for the righteous man, because he is inconvenient to us and opposes our actions; he reproaches us for sins against the law, and accuses us of sins against our training. Let us see if his words are true, and let us test what will happen at the end of his life; for if the righteous man is God\u2019s son, he will help him, and will deliver him from the hand of his adversaries. Afterwards, the Psalm: Save me, O God, by thy name, and vindicate me by thy might. The second reading, from the Letter of James: For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice. If you\u2019re biblically inclined, the full readings can be found here. The theme of today\u2019s readings is humility. But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, without uncertainty or insincerity. This is the most jubilant Kyrie and Gloria I have ever heard! They\u2019re two musical liturgical elements to introduce the mass: to beg mercy from God, and to give glory to him. The pontiff censes the altar and a statue of the Virgin Mary, and asks the congregation to confess their sins. An enormous choir and orchestra are singing the Kyrie. Tens of thousands of people have crowded into in Revolution Square beneath massive portraits of revolutionary leaders Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos on the facades of nearby buildings. Hundreds of Cubans and foreign visitors began streaming into the sprawling square overnight, and nearly a million people are expected to attend, including Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro and Argentina\u2019s Cristina Kirchner. (As we reported yesterday, Guevara\u2019s daughter Aleida is not one of them.) \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to see Pope Francis. He\u2019ll be the third pope I\u2019ve managed to see, but I\u2019ve never been so close. We\u2019re all hoping to receive his mercy,\u201d Maria Eugenia Paulina Prieto, 56, who sings in a choir that will perform during the ceremony, told AFP. \u201cHis visit is cause for hope in our aspirations for improvement,\u201d said biologist Benito Espinoza, 41, told Reuters. \u201cWe are an optimistic people, but we have suffered for many years.\u201d Mauren Gomez, 40, travelled some 250 kilometers (155 miles) from Villa Clara to Havana by bus with four friends for the Mass, saying they spent their pilgrimage praying the Rosary. \u201cThis is very important for us,\u201d she told the AP. Jose Rafael Velazquez, a 54-year-old worker, arrived with his wife at the plaza three hours before mass was due to begin. He said he isn\u2019t religious, but came more out of curiosity to witness a historic event. \u201cWe also are very hopeful for this visit, because the pope was key in the deal with the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cEver since the announcement, there have been changes and this visit gives me more hope that it\u2019ll get better.\u201d The crowd erupted in cheers, waving Cuban, Vatican and Argentinian flags as he made his way through the crowd in his open-sided popemobile. A chorus sang a mix of traditional Cuban songs and religious tunes. Francis stopped several times to kiss children handed up to him and to bless several people in wheelchairs. From my colleague Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Rome: Pope Francis will shift gears on his first full day in Cuba today, with a message that is more pastoral in nature and less obviously focused on politics. He will start the day with a mass in front of hundreds of thousands of Cubans in Revolution Plaza and will, later in the day, have a formal meeting with Cuban president Ra\u00fal Castro. The big question of the day is whether the pope will also have a meeting with Raul\u2019s brother Fidel, the revolutionary leader who is thought to be too frail to attend the public events. Most Vatican watchers believe that if Francis does, indeed, add a visit to Fidel to his schedule, it will be today, his only full day in Havana. Francis has said that he would be arriving in Cuba as a messenger of mercy \u2013 a theme that is key and constant in his papacy \u2013 and wants to show solidarity to the people of Cuba, who have suffered for decades under the US embargo. The crowds are enormous! Hi Popefans! And welcome to the Guardian\u2019s coverage of Pope Francis\u2019s visit to Cuba. It\u2019s an absolutely huge day today for the pontiff, who is at this moment arriving in the Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f2n in Havana to celebrate the mass with thousands of jubilant Cubans. If you want to follow the proceedings live, there\u2019s a YouTube stream below. As a way of introduction, I\u2019m Adam Brereton, the opinion editor for the Guardian\u2019s Australian team, and I\u2019m so thrilled to be joining my US colleagues to help cover Pope Francis\u2019s historic pilgrimage to Cuba and the US. Good morning, and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the first full day of Pope Francis\u2019s visit to Cuba. The pope is due to celebrate mass in Revolution Square in Havana at 9am ET (6am PT, 2pm UK). After that, in the afternoon, he will visit President Ra\u00fal Castro at the Palace of the Revolution. Following that, he will meet Cuban Catholics, old and young. Pope Francis arrived in Cuba on Saturday, and gave a speech in which he called for the US and Cuba to set a \u201cglobal example of reconciliation\u201d \u2013 a call he was well placed to make, having played a major role in the recent thaw between the two countries which has seen embassies reopen and Republicans in the US seethe at another of Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy goals. Our report, from Jonathan Watts in Havana and Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Rome, is here. Adam Brereton will be anchoring our live coverage today \u2013 he\u2019ll be here shortly. For further reading before he arrives, here\u2019s an analysis piece by Peter Stanford, who says: The world has responded to the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires with enthusiasm on account of his warmth, humility, spontaneity and habit of going off-script as far as the doctrines of his church are concerned. But Francis is also, in his own words, \u201ca little furbo\u201d \u2013 ie, shrewd, clever, an operator. This less remarked-on side has been seen in the way he is systematically reforming the corrupt, bloated Vatican curia (civil service) and straightening out its dodgy bank \u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
