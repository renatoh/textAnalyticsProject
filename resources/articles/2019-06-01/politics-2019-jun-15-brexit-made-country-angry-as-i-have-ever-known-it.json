I\u2019m hearing anxieties voiced in a way I haven\u2019t heard since the 1990s: a rundown NHS, job insecurity, teacher shortages. Seven out of 10 feel pessimistic about homelessness, 68% are gloomy about rising poverty, and a staggering one in five think it likely that they, or someone close, will be a victim of violent crime in the next year. This rises to almost a third in London. We\u2019re a deeply divided nation, too \u2013 and nearly three-quarters of us expect that to get worse in the year ahead. Forty-eight per cent self-identify as a \u201chave-not\u201d while 52% see themselves as a \u201chave\u201d. We\u2019re torn apart by social class, by geography, and by how we vote \u2013 especially on Brexit. The starkest divide, though, is age: 52% of over-65s feel optimistic about the future of the UK, contrasting with just 23% of under-34s. Younger people feel a strong sense of injustice. Home ownership seems a pipe dream, even for the relatively well off. Secure employment can be elusive for them too, despite many being far better qualified than their parents and grandparents. But our survey suggests they shouldn\u2019t hope for sympathy. Many in the older generation dismiss them as \u201cliberal snowflakes\u201d who waste cash on \u201cavocado toast and flat whites\u201d, then waste away weekends \u201cwatching screens\u201d. Seventy-eight per cent of over-45s and 82% of those over 65 believe British values are in decline, and many see young people as the cause: \u201cThey just don\u2019t have the same values we do \u2013 or the respect that we had.\u201d Where the nation can agree is that we probably can\u2019t expect politicians to lead us out of this mess. Trust has long been in short supply. Ipsos Mori\u2019s \u201cveracity index\u201d shows that just 19% believe politicians tell the truth \u2013 unchanged since 1983. What\u2019s happening now is different, and potentially much more damaging: voters have lost faith in politicians\u2019 ability to govern competently. Our focus groups, regardless of how they voted, felt the scales fall from their eyes as they watched \u201cthem\u201d grapple with Brexit. One told me: \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019ve all woken up.\u201d Their verdict? Politicians are \u201ctotally useless\u201d, \u201cclueless\u201d or \u201cunbelievably poor\u201d. Seventy-four per cent conclude that our political system is no longer fit for purpose, and 83% feel let down by the entire political establishment. Just 6% believe politicians understand them. Some of this is tragic, some cringe-making \u2013 \u201cin the last two years there have been so many political problems it\u2019s an embarrassment to be a UK citizen\u201d said one, explaining why 73% think that our once-proud nation is currently \u201cseen as a laughing-stock by the rest of the world\u201d. There are a few crumbs of comfort. While pessimism about Britain is palpable, just over half feel optimistic about their local area, and two-thirds are optimistic about their personal lives \u2013 and this is true for voters of all ages. Many feel that, whatever happens on the national stage, British character will win out: 69% agree that \u201cBritish people will just get on with things regardless of the impact of Brexit\u201d. But the cloud of uncertainty hangs heavily. Voters long for a leader to map a clear route through. One observed: \u201cWe seem to be stumbling along a crooked path and not towards a target.\u201d Eighty-six per cent say the \u201cUK needs a strong leader now more than ever before\u2019\u201d Meanwhile, perhaps in a triumph of hope over experience, voters are watching the Tory leadership battle very carefully. The bar is set high. Deborah Mattinson is founder director of research and strategy consultancy BritainThinks"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
