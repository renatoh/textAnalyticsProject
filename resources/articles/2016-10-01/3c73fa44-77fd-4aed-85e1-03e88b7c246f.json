Liverpool, then managed by Brendan Rodgers, paid \u00a332.5m to sign the striker from Aston Villa in the summer of 2015 but then sold him a year later to Crystal Palace after Klopp decided the forward did not fit into his plans. Now Benteke, who has scored three goals in seven Premier League games, faces Liverpool for the first time since leaving Anfield and Klopp believes his side will face a testing time at Selhurst Park. \u201cWhen you have a player like Christian in your squad, of course we knew about his quality,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cBut every player needs the space to perform, to develop and to show things. For different reasons we couldn\u2019t give him all the time [he needed], you lose a little bit of confidence, you feel pressure. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t change it and I thought, and I\u2019m pretty sure Christian thinks the same, it made sense. He made the transfer so, for Crystal Palace, what a player. We know it best because we had him all the time in training and in all moments he showed always his quality. \u201cIt\u2019s never really nice because there\u2019s a lot of expectation from both sides when you make a transfer like this. But in my job I can\u2019t always be nice. I have to make a decision for the club and for the team.\u201d \u201cChristian is a great player and a wonderful person,\u201d Klopp added. \u201cI have nothing bad to say about him. Unfortunately now he plays for Crystal Palace and now we have to face them. It will be really difficult. \u201cHe has given them a real boost of quality. Will he feel like he has a point to prove? I have no idea. You would have to ask him. It\u2019s not the first time in my life that I\u2019ve played against a player who was in my team the previous season.\u201d Keeping a large squad full of international players happy is a perennial issue for Premier League managers. This week Simon Mignolet said he would never be satisfied as a No2 after Klopp announced Loris Karius was his first-choice keeper. But the German insisted his is a happy camp, saying: \u201cI\u2019m always honest and I say my door and the door in the team is always open but it\u2019s about performing. We have always this agreement: work hard, don\u2019t talk too much, win games. If a player doesn\u2019t want to be happy, I can\u2019t keep him happy but, if he wants to be happy, it\u2019s quite easy for me to keep him happy. \u201cBeing happy only when you make 48 games, it\u2019s difficult for each player. To feel you are important for the team, that\u2019s 100 per cent true for each player in the squad. I think it\u2019s not too difficult to be happy in our team.\u201d Liverpool head to London looking to make it six wins from seven Premier League games, a run that has put them level on points with Manchester City and Arsenal at the top of the table. James Milner is a doubt after missing Tuesday\u2019s 2-1 EFL Cup win over Tottenham through illness while the captain, Jordan Henderson, is back in the squad after suspension. Klopp, meanwhile, insisted no decision has yet been made about the future of Melwood. It has been reported that the Reds are ready to sell their long-term training base in order to bring all age groups under one roof. Currently the academy and youth teams train at Kirkby and there is no room to expand Melwood. Klopp added: \u201cIt makes sense to improve the circumstances. We didn\u2019t finally decide about it because it\u2019s not all in our hands but of course we have to think about developing things, to make it more likely to get the best out of our talents, to have the best circumstances for the first team, the under-23s, all the youth teams, and space is an important thing to think about.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
