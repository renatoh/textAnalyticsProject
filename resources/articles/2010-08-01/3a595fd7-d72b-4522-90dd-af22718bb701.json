Could there be a KGB connection? With its subtly deployed late-60s detail, Free Country is a treat for fans of traditional Len Deighton-style spy thrillers. That said, it's lighter and cruder than its predecessor \u2013 over-reliant on well-handled but implausible chase sequences and 180-degree reversals, not least Dark's shift from romantic opportunist to righteous crusader. There's a tension, too, between the entirely convincing (and unnerving) political universe Dark inhabits and his creator's obvious love of post-Connery Bond: damsel in distress Sarah is a dead ringer for Britt Ekland in The Man With The Golden Gun. Collusion by Stuart Neville (Harvill Secker, \u00a312.99) Calling a main character John Lennon would derail a less serious and single-minded novel than Neville's follow-up to The Twelve. Neville underplays the gag \u2013 everyone calls the conflicted cop Jack \u2013 and there's precious little else to laugh about in this tale of dirty politics played out in a post-ceasefire Belfast where ancient animosities fester and everyone has a price. Gangster Bull O'Kane has hired a hit man known as The Traveller to finish off former IRA assassin Gerry Fegan \u2013 his nemesis, and the only man he fears. But Fegan, hiding out in New York and haunted by the ghosts of people he's killed, has an aura of deranged invincibility about him, as well as a mysterious attachment to Lennon's daughter. Brisk, addictive and possessing an expert sense of when to play the \"supernatural\" card, Collusion is a worthy successor to one of last year's best thrillers. Faithful Place by Tana French (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a312.99) As a teenager in 80s Dublin, undercover cop Frank Mackey arranged to run away to England with his girlfriend, Rosie. But Rosie never showed up, and the note she left implied she'd had second thoughts about their relationship and decided to make the journey alone. Twenty-five years later, Frank is divorced and enjoying an evening with the daughter he rarely sees when he gets a call: Rosie's suitcase has been found, stuffed up the chimney of a derelict house. Slowly \u2013 rather too slowly \u2013 a different story suggests itself. The problem here is too great a focus on the domestic comedy of Frank's eccentric estranged family, particularly his overbearing mother. It unbalances the novel so that it feels more like a wry meditation on ageing, class and paths not taken than something calculated to thrill and unsettle. Think of a Number by John Verdon (Penguin, \u00a36.99) Sometimes a single neat idea is enough. That's almost the case in this spry debut, much praised on its US publication, in which a retired detective, Dave Gurney, is seduced back into the game when an old college acquaintance turns up bearing an anonymous letter. \"Think of a number,\" it taunts, and the number within matches the one the recipient picked. Spooky \u2013 especially when the man ends up dead shortly afterwards. There's much to enjoy here besides the brain-mangling howdunit element: the thrill of the chase; but also the snappy by-play between Gurney and his long-suffering wife, Madeleine. The writing, however, lets the book down. Think of a Number is bloatedly wordy in places, as though Verdon worked with an open thesaurus on his knee."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
