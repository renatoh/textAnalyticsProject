Plenty for the new head of communications to be getting on with, whoever it shall be. Many questions arise from the debacle, and here's one: what next for the hero of the hour, Giles Fraser, the canon chancellor who did the right thing and walked out? Well, there are possibilities, for Southwark Cathedral is right now choosing a new dean to replace Colin Slee, who died last November. It's late in the day. But there are 11th-hour calls for the authorities to draft Fraser in as the new dean. Supporters say he would be a strong candidate, high profile, liberal, a good media performer, charismatic \u2013 and he knows Southwark diocese. He was vicar of Putney for nine years before moving to St Paul's. He'd even be able to look out of his window in the dean's house, next to the Globe on London's South Bank, with a fine view of the dome of St Paul's just across the river. With the right wind, he might one day hear the evensong of the bailiffs, wrestling with protesters, ripping down their tents. \u2022 To Westminster now \u2013 where it is Labour's position, and it is a reasonable one, that if you really want answers on the environment, you really want the secretary of state. So Labour was pretty put out when minister Greg Barker was fielded by the government to explain the coalition's decision to cut the subsidy available for households to harness solar energy. Not only is that cut unfair to householders of modest means, argued the climate change shadow Caroline Flint, but it also threatens jobs and businesses in what should be a growing industry. It's not that Labour has anything against Barker, but they do take exception to the secretary of state Chris Huhne, who apparently sought to mollify the party's opposition by offering Flint a chance to talk about it privately on Sunday evening. \"She said no to the chat, and told his team that cosy Sunday night chats weren't the way to do business, and that with thousands of jobs on the line, the Commons should have the chance to debate things properly,\" a source tells us. With his hopes of a cosy stitch-up dashed, the debate took place, and Labour gave the coalition both barrels. Barker took the hit; and Huhne was nowhere to be seen. \u2022 It's amazing \u2013 some turnaround, some life. Ex-Tory MP Neil Hamilton, here revealed and disgraced in 1996 as \"A liar and a cheat\" over the cash for questions scandal: now elected to the national executive of Ukip. You just can't keep a good man down. Or Neil. \u2022 And as the phone-hacking hearings continue, there is well-earned posthumous triumph for the News of the World, vindicated by convictions arising from Mazher Mahmood's exclusive about cricket match-fixing allegations. Dark days ahead for the players themselves and, of course, for Pakistani cricket. Nothing for officials to do but rebuild the team and hope in time to rebuild a reputation. And they might change the name of the Gaddafi cricket stadium in Lahore to something else. \u2022 Finally, yesterday's reference to Fred \"Nutty\" Sharpe, head of the Flying Squad in the 1930s and star of a new history of the unit, brings further recollections of the man who made DC Gene Hunt from TV's Life on Mars look like Larry Grayson. In his memoir, Nutty pronounced on the newly arrived migrants from eastern Europe in the early part of the last century. They were, he observed: \"Russians in top-boots, leather leggings and fur hats; wild-looking people from the most outlandish parts of that great uncivilised land.\" Bad, plain bad, they were. \"A lot were desperadoes and went in for crime straight away.\" But it wasn't all bare-knuckled stuff with Nutty. Raiding an illegal club in the West End in the 20s, he showed he could be quite stylish: \"I went to the Manhattan Club in evening dress and opera hat with a friend who was a man about town,\" he recalled. \"The music stopped as the cry went up 'It's a raid'.\" They seemed to take it \"as a lark, for it gave them a thrill. But they changed their views when they appeared before the beak.\" Collars were felt; the law prevailed. And Nutty didn't hit anybody. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2011 because the original said Greg Clark explained the coalition's decision to cut the subsidy available for households to harness solar energy.
