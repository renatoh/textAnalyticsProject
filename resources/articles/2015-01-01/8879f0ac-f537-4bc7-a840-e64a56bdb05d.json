A deep area of low pressure across the UK on Boxing Day plunged southwards through France and into the Alps on Saturday. Very cold air, both ahead of and behind the winter storm, allowed precipitation to fall widely as snow. Between 80cm-100cm fell in parts of the French Alps, and while this was good for the ski industry following a poor early season, thousands were left stranded in their cars as travel chaos ensued. The Savoy region was particularly hard-hit, with an estimated 15,000 people requiring emergency shelter. During the holiday period, unusually heavy rain has affected parts of eastern Asia, with Malaysia hardest hit. While flooding is commonplace during the monsoon season, the extent and intensity of rain over the past week has been described as the worst in three decades. Widespread flooding has displaced at least 150,000 people, submerging hundreds of towns and villages and reportedly causing the death of 10 people. Thailand has also been affected, with nearly 10,000 people forced from their homes as the waters rose. Meanwhile, violent thunderstorms have been unleashing damaging winds and torrential rain on eastern Brazil over the past couple of days. The area around Sao Paulo has been worst affected with trees blown down and electricity supplies cut. At Praia Grande, near the city of Santos, lightning struck a crowded beach on Monday, killing four members of the same family and injuring several others."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
