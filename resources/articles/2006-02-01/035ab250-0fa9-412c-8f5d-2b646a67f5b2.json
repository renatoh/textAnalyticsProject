Tony Blair's official spokesman conceded there was a \"higher\" risk of the virus hitting the UK but said this was not yet inevitable. Ministers attempted to curb panic and said there were no plans to bring poultry indoors at this stage or carry out mass vaccinations. France and the Netherlands have ordered all poultry indoors in recent days, and this afternoon EU agriculture ministers in Brussels discussed a French request that all farm birds should be vaccinated against bird flu. Albert Osterhaus, the head of virology at the University of Rotterdam and an adviser to the Dutch government, said the UK should follow his country's lead in bringing all poultry indoors. Since a vaccine took nearly a month to take effect, immediate action should be taken to minimise contact between poultry and the wild birds thought to carry the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus, he said. Dr Osterhaus told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It is important to realise that migrating birds could bring in the virus, and where possible action should be taken to avoid contact [with farmed birds]. If it is not possible to bring them indoors, you should consider vaccinating them. To be effective you have to vaccinate them twice, which takes 30 days.\" He said speed was vital because bird migration would increase soon. But the UK's animal health minister, Ben Bradshaw, said poultry would only be kept indoors if the H5N1 strain of bird flu reached the UK. \"Our contingency plan, which we have had in place for several years, is that we would only order the housing of birds if there was an outbreak in this country,\" he said. \"We are certainly thinking about it, and poultry keepers are ready to do it within 24 hours if we give the order. But it's worth remembering that the Netherlands and Germany both unnecessarily housed their birds in September last year at great expense, only to later let them out again.\" Nine dead swans found dead in the UK which had been tested for signs of the H5N1 were confirmed today to have been free of the disease, Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said. The birds had been sent for tests over the weekend after members of the public called a Defra helpline. Meanwhile today, Professor Neil Ferguson, a mathematical biologist from Imperial College London, warned that the disease could be endemic in wild bird populations for decades and called for a long-term, sustainable response. \"I think at the moment the government's response is proportionate because of the large number of animals,\" Prof Ferguson, who has been commissioned by Defra to model how bird flu might spread, told the BBC. He said it would be \"a little preliminary\" to use a vaccine now in the UK, but said supplies should be stockpiled. \"This is a disease that does not go away, so we are going to be living with H5N1 in western Europe, I believe, in wild bird populations - even endemic in wild bird populations - for decades, perhaps. \"So we need to have a response that is sustainable in the long term and, whilst extreme precautions might seem attractive initially, I think we need to be thinking what we will be doing in 12 to 48 months' time in terms of having a sustainable policy that minimises the chance of the infection getting into domestic poultry.\" The controversial proposal for mass vaccinations, which risks costing farmers their export markets, is also on the agenda at a separate meeting tomorrow of national bird flu experts from the 25 EU member states. France requested the move last week, before becoming the seventh EU country affected by the current spread of the virus. The Netherlands, which has previous experience of bird flu, backs the idea. European commission officials warned last week that Europe-wide vaccination of poultry may not work. The same doubts will be voiced by the Defra secretary, Margaret Beckett, at today's talks amid government assurances that the department already has effective countermeasures in place to take effect if and when the deadly H5N1 strain is confirmed in Britain. \"We have nothing against vaccination in principle,\" a government spokesman said, \"but we are not convinced that the scientific knowledge is there to prove it would work.\" This afternoon the French health minister, Xavier Bertrand, urged people to stay calm and keep eating poultry. The government had set aside \u20ac730m (\u00a3500m) to fight the disease, and no farms in the country, Europe's largest poultry producer, had been hit by the virus, he said. Bosnian officials reported their first cases of bird flu today, in two swans, but said further tests were required to establish whether the birds had died of the H5N1 strain of the virus. The Malaysian government announced that 40 chickens died last week of H5N1 flu in the first reported cases of the virus in the country in more than a year. More cases were also reported in India, Egypt and Hungary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
