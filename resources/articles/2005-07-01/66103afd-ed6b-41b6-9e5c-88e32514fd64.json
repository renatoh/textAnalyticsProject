ITV is breathing new life into the Morse franchise with the drama, entitled Lewis, in a similar way to Scottish detective series Taggart, which carried on after the death of eponymous lead Mark McManus. The last Morse starring John Thaw in the title role, The Remorseful Day, in which the grumpy detective had a heart attack and died in an Oxford college quad, was broadcast in November 2000. Thaw died in February 2002, aged 60, of cancer. In the new drama Whately's character, promoted to inspector, returns to his old Oxford stomping ground after two years abroad and is soon investigating the murder of an American student. Lewis's inquiries lead him to a fellow student, Danny Griffon, whose family owns an Oxford racing car business and who has previously featured in a case investigated by Morse. \"I know it's going to be strange returning to the character of Lewis without John, but Morse's spirit pervades a great new script and I am looking forward to filming it and to seeing what has happened in Lewis's life and career,\" Whately said. The return of Whately's Morse character is expected to a be a big crowd-puller for ITV - The Remorseful Day was watched by 13.66 million viewers in November 2000. The original Morse series launched in 1987 and the Oxford-based cultured ale and crossword-loving inspector was a hit from the start, with high ratings not only for the initial screenings of the 33 episodes made but also for the repeats. In the new drama, Lewis has acquired a new young sidekick, detective sergeant James Hathaway, played by Laurence Fox. Clare Holman, who played pathologist Laura Hobson in five Morse films, will also be reprising her role. Lewis has been scripted by Stephen Churchett from a story by Russell Lewis. Mr Churchett also adapted The Remorseful Day from Morse creator Colin Dexter's novel and has also been working on ITV1's Agatha Christie adaptations. The drama is to be produced by Chris Burt, a veteran of 11 previous Morse films. Ted Childs, who has also had a long association with the show, is one of the executive producers. ITV drama executives Michele Buck and Damien Timmer are sharing executive producing duties, along with Rebecca Eaton, executive producer for Lewis co-producer WGBH Boston. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
