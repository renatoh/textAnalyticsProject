New member, vibraphonist Lewis Wright, has given the band a whole new range of tones and textures. This set is dedicated to exploring the music and influence of the late Eric Dolphy, whose star is on the rise again. Since Dolphy was a multi-instrument virtuoso, this wasn't an easy task, but they catch the distinctive flavour of his work beautifully. Guest artist Julian Siegel's bass clarinet playing is quite marvellous."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
