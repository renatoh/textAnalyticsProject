About 90% of households in South Australia had their power restored by Thursday morning after the mass blackout on Wednesday night, but 80,000 people in the north of Adelaide were still without power. The federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has questioned whether South Australia was too reliant on renewable energy as the state\u2019s premier, Jay Weatherill, said no system could have coped with the major storm and cyclonic winds that lashed the state, which led to lightning strikes hitting generators, causing a surge and overloading the network\u2019s capacity. \u201cThe system ... operated as planned,\u201d Weatherill said. The storm tore 22 separate transmission towers from the ground and generated more than 80,000 lightning strikes across the state. Map: number of people affected by power outages The mass blackout has drawn attention to South Australia\u2019s networks and how it supplies electricity. The state has a 40% renewable energy target. Although Frydenberg acknowledged the cause of the blackout was the weather event, and was not linked to renewables, he questioned the state\u2019s high targets. \u201cThere is a bigger question for us to say well how can we prevent this going forward,\u201d he said on Radio National on Thursday morning. \u201cThere are questions with renewable energy, particularly the fact it is intermittent.\u201d Regarding South Australia\u2019s renewable targets he said: \u201cThese are unrealistic state-based targets and my job is to try and bring the states to the table with the commonwealth.\u201d Independent South Australia senator Nick Xenophon has also questioned South Australia\u2019s reliance on renewable energy, and called for an examination of the incident by the Australian Energy Market Commission. \u201cThe best thing to do now finally power is coming back on in some parts of the state is for the energy commission to look into this,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we had more thermal generators at the time and less of a reliance on intermittent capacity, [we should examine] whether that would have made a difference in terms of the way it cascaded into a shutdown.\u201d The Climate Council attributed the wild weather to continuing erratic climate patterns from climate change. Professor Will Steffen said the storm is \u201ca disturbing preview of what\u2019s likely to come if Australia fails to act on climate change\u201d. He said the atmosphere is packing much more energy than 70 years ago, which contributes to the increasing intensity of storms and increased rainfall. The state is continuing to prepare for more storms on Thursday with the Bureau of Meteorology forecasting further gale force winds across the state, along with heavy rainfall and flooding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
