It is good to know that in the rapidly changing world of cricket some traditions never change. It was in Indore against Central Zone in 1981-82 that Ian Botham bludgeoned 122 from 55 balls with 15 fours and seven sixes \u2014 said to be the best piece of hitting ever witnessed in the city. It was especially brilliant as it had the desperation of a man with a terrible hangover, half wanting to succeed, half wanting to get out and go and have a lie down. Frank wrote in The Guardian the following morning about how that night he had been drinking with the man that Indore knew as Iron Bottom until dawn was approaching and that he had marvelled at his pulverizing of the Central Zone attack a few hours later. I've just tried to look up Frank's wondrous prose on Google but can't find it. Until I can the internet is not quite perfect after all. I think the point I am stumbling towards is this: when I read Keating's words in my early 20s I was secretly appalled that a journalist could drink with an England player deep into the night on the morning of a match and then blatantly admit his irresponsibility the next day. It made me feel square and I was bitterly ashamed. Maybe I was an advance guard for the tight-assed mentality of today? And if so, was that a good place to be? We have now moved on to Kanpur where, much to my surprise, I am staying in the team hotel for the second match running. I suppose I should be happy about the professional convenience of it all, but the security does my head in. (I'm sorry to say \"does my head in\" but it's 11.30pm here, there are only so many hours in a day and I've got a match in the morning). Yesterday, I wandered 100 metres from the hotel to mosey through the market and find a recharge card for my mobile phone. OK, and also to lap up the vague frisson of being spotted as an \"unusual person about town\". I'm sad that way. Because England were in the adjoining hotel, police lined every yard of the route, except that England players never leave their hotel for officially-induced fear of attack from someone vaguely connected to the Axis of Evil. When I returned to the hotel, it took me half an hour to be allowed back through the gate. \"Do I look like someone about to attack Kevin Pietersen?'' I asked. When I showed my room key, a senior policeman asked me suspiciously: \"Whose room key is that?'' Security is tight. Back in Indore, after the end of the second ODI, my taxi driver was nowhere to be seen, having been endlessly diverted at every corner so he could not break into the stadium with a box of matches and set light to Ian Bell's one-day batting average. It was rush hour and there was not an empty tuk-tuk in sight. It was then that Siddhant \u2014 official India tour hero No1 \u2014 spotted my disorientation and offered me a lift across the city on his motorbike. Siddhant would particularly like to say \"hello\" to his girlfriend in Canada via this diary. I'm happy to oblige. She has chosen well. How many Indians walking out of a day-night international at, say, Edgbaston, and struggling to find a taxi back to the city centre, would be offered a free lift from a young Brummie on a motorbike with the comment: \"It is my city, it is my gift''? I rest my case. What made this tale especially Indian was that half a mile from my hotel, my taxi driver suddenly appeared alongside the motorbike, gesturing maniacally at my betrayal. Incidentally, there are no accompanying photos of this, as promised when the last diary told of my cultural adventure buying a digital camera, because someone has already nicked it. Total number of shots taken on \u00a3130 camera: nil. And no receipts to claim it back on expenses. You might think that this diary talks about little else but travel in India, but that's because outside the cricket we do little else but travel in India. Today, Messrs Hobson from The Times, Newman from The Mail and Hodgson from Press Association left the stadium in Kanpur to find their taxi had not arrived. Summoning all the experience of the well-travelled English media, they identified a taxi by virtue of its yellow light on the bonnet, flagged it down and instructed the driver to take them to their hotel. It turned out that a yellow light in Kanpur actually indicates the car of a VIP. The Kanpur textile magnate was an extremely generous host in the circumstances and everybody hopes he did not miss his meeting. But I am rambling on, it's midnight and have I mentioned there is a match in the morning? One last tour story: At the weekend I stole an extra night in Mumbai to research a story about the potential horrors of BCCI TV. We are all sleepwalking into an era when sports organisations run their own TV stations, but no one has the energy to do anything about it, least of all me. In the process of gathering vital research, I heard a story about Ralph Dellor, a voice that the more deluded of you may know. The theory goes that cricket highlights on mobile phones are the next big thing. I beg to disagree. Ralph, the only man I have ever known who commentates with a perpetual smile on his face, is the voice of Vodafone mobile phone technology. This is why: Vodafone can't use the TV commentary because when, say, Nasser Hussain, says: \"Look at that: glorious shot,'' the mobile phone viewer has no idea where the ball is. And they certainly couldn't use Jonathan Agnew's radio commentary because he would get so descriptive there would be no bandwidth left for the action. So they use Ralph, who basically translates \"you've no chance of seeing the ball you saddo, but he's hit it through cover,'' into a really happy feeling that you belong to something special. You don't of course. What you are looking at is a complete waste of time. Wake up to the fact before it's too late."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
