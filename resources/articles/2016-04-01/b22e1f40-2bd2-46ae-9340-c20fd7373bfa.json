Palace are eight points clear of the relegation zone but not yet mathematically safe. They visit Pardew\u2019s former club, second-bottom Newcastle United, on Saturday seeking to secure the points needed to guarantee their top-flight status. Pardew and Jones share mutual friends, including the sports psychologist Jeremy Snape, with the Australian invited to Palace\u2019s Beckenham training base on Thursday to speak to the academy coaches and the senior squad as they prepared for the trip to St James\u2019 Park. \u201cHe had a few words to the team about complacency and what good teams do,\u201d said Pardew, whose side have won once in the league over the past 18 matches. \u201cThe most important point he made was that great teams can get to finals but great teams only win finals if they\u2019re great all the time. We have to be great this Saturday. That was the key point I took from him. We can\u2019t turn up at Newcastle and let our standards slip from Sunday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final otherwise we\u2019re doing a disservice to our fans and ourselves. \u201cEddie came in and spent the morning with us, speaking to the academy coaches and to some of the senior players like Paddy McCarthy, who wants to be a coach in the future. Then he came on to the training pitch and addressed the starting XI. It was very kind of him to do that. He gave a lot of examples of how communication between the team and the coaches is important, and the players just absorbed it. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to hear it from somebody from a different genre, a different field, who carries the weight he does. We\u2019ve been quite close since he came over here [to take up the reins of the national side last December] and a lot of the views he has on trying to get more from individual players and the group run parallel with my own. \u201cIt was good timing getting him in, what with the result we had on Sunday. He\u2019s the coach of England rugby and involved in World Cups with other nations, a multicultural personality and someone who is engaging. If they can\u2019t take on his comments then we are in trouble.\u201d Pardew has used Snape regularly this season, as he has at previous clubs, and maintained the theme by inviting Teddy Sheringham in to speak with the academy coaches on Thursday afternoon. While Jones has mooted the idea of a reciprocal arrangement with a visit to the England rugby setup, the Palace manager admitted he gained personally from the Australian\u2019s involvement. \u201cWe could share a couple of issues we both have as managers: looking after players and problems; lightning bolts which strike you like injuries... things he does in communication with his players that are interesting for me. There are a couple of things that are crossovers between the sports.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
