Three-month copper futures on the London Metal Exchange fell 3.3% to $7,560 (\u00a34,054) a tonne and aluminium dropped to $2,550. Platinum prices fell 3.5% to a 10-week low, gold tumbled 4% and silver fell 7% to a six-week low. Oil slipped to below $66 a barrel on an improved outlook for US supplies. The premier index was further dragged down by Wall Street reacting to commodity and oil prices, and bad news from Dell. The computer maker saw its shares tumble more than 4% after it announced it had suspended its share buyback programme, and was delaying its quarterly report owing to a securities and exchange commission inquiry into its accounting. Vedanta Resources, the India-focused miner, led the decline with an 82p fall to \u00a312.39 and the other majors followed suit. BHP Billiton shed 48p to 934p, Rio Tinto fell 128p to \u00a325.44 and Kazakhmys dropped 60p to \u00a312.26. In the oil sector, Cairn Energy fell 54p to \u00a319.47, Royal Dutch Shell dropped 26p to \u00a317.70 and BP slipped 8p to 583p. The drop in oil prices proved a bonus for airline stocks, with British Airways shares rising 3.5p to 417.75p and easyJet up 8.5p to 448p. Prudential was one of the biggest risers in the FTSE 100 after a newspaper report said Swiss Re, the world's largest reinsurer, had made an offer to buy the British insurer's UK closed-life funds for as much as \u00a35bn. Jacques Aigrain, the head of Swiss Re, said he was \"surprised\" by the report, but shares in Prudential still rose 8p to 591p. Vodafone was also a FTSE 100 winner after it confirmed it had signed a deal with the wholesale arm of BT to provide its customers in Britain with fixed-line broadband services. Shares in the mobile phone group, which said it would launch the proposition before the end of the year, rose 1.25p to 114.75p. BT was up 4.75p to 253.25p. AB Foods, owner of Primark and supplier of half of Britain's total annual requirement for sugar, initially slipped but ended little changed as it warned second half profits would fall owing to lower results from its sugar and bakery divisions. The group said the fall in earnings was in line with its expectations, adding that Primark had delivered very strong sales and profit growth in the second half. Richard Hunter, head of UK equities at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Given that Primark now accounts for nearly a third of group profits, for the moment this lifts some of the [sugar] doom and gloom from the shares, which are, on balance, positively viewed by the market.\" Shares were up 0.5p to 820p. On the consolidation front, Stanley Leisure was top of the FTSE 250 risers as Malaysia's Genting confirmed it had agreed to buy the British casino operator for \u00a3639m. Stanley Leisure rose 20.5p to 875.5p, aided by rumours of a counter-bid from Harrah's or MGM Mirage. The FTSE 250 was down 83.2 points to 9523.10 as investors reacted to a flurry of first-half results. Shares in British port operator Forth Ports dropped 71p to \u00a317.74. The group warned that trading in July and August had been below expectations due to unexpected maintenance shutdowns affecting some ports. Forth Ports announced a 19% rise in pre-tax profit for the first six months of the year. The downbeat announcement on summer trading spooked investors, though there was some profit-taking because of recent gains in the share price. Andy Murphy, at Panmure Gordon, said: \"A decent set of results has been let down by the profit outlook for the full year in the port division. We will remain buyers, but expect the stock to give up much of the recent bounce.\" Hiscox fell as it reported a 30% drop in first-half pre-tax profit due to a weak dollar. The insurance group confirmed plans to move to Bermuda to benefit from a lighter tax regime. The shares fell 12p to 227p. Robin Savage, of Panmure Gordon, said: \"The impact of the UK retail advertising spend, creation of Hiscox USA and Hiscox Bermuda should begin to materialise in the second half. The re-domicile to Bermuda should be helpful in the long term. We wait to see how the second half develops before turning more positive than hold.\" Sportingbet plunged 95p to 144p as its shares resumed trading on Aim. Peter Dicks, the online gaming group's chairman, was arrested in the US on Thursday, prompting fears for the industry. Mr Dicks is the second British executive to have been held by US authorities. David Carruthers, chief executive of BetonSports, was arrested on racketeering charges, which he has denied. Burst Media, the online advertiser, plunged 52p to 28.5p on Aim as it warned that results would be \"significantly below current market expectations\" for the year. The group will announce its first-half results next Monday. Also on Aim, Highland Gold continued its downward slide after a fire at its Darasun mine in eastern Russia killed 25 workers. The company has said it will resume production this week, but the shares fell 15.75p to 139.25p. Sports contests Sports Cafe Holdings, the sports bar owner that confirmed it had received an approach on Friday, soared 23% - or 8.5p - to 45.5p on talk other suitors had materialised, prompting hopes of a bidding war. On Friday, Sports Cafe said the approach was \"very preliminary in nature\". Last night it was understood to be preparing to announce the approach had materialised into a cash offer, although this could now be scuppered by the new suitors. The potential bid is understood to value the company at a substantial premium to yesterday's closing price. But sources said the suitors could be interested in the long-term potential of Sports Cafe Bet, the group's new initiative that involves setting up online sports gambling and betting shops next to the bars. marianne.barriaux@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
