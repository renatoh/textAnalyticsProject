And that one, that one had slaves in it!\u201d Horton, a professor at Bristol University, approaches the house, once the home to the trader Henry Bright, who owned a slave named \u201cBristol\u201d, and points to some holes at ground level, like tiny portholes. \u201cHaha,\u201d he says, his enthusiasm getting the better of him, \u201cthat\u2019s probably where they would have lived.\u201d For the city of Bristol, home to happiness, hipsters, rising property prices and austerity, has an under-acknowledged history: slavery. Last week, students at the University of Bristol launched a petition to remove the Wills name from the Wills Memorial Building, the institution\u2019s principal and most visible structure, the last gothic hurrah of imperial Britain, all thrusting buttresses and vaulted ceilings standing proud at the top of Park Row in the centre of the city. Henry Overton Wills ran WD &amp; HO Wills between 1846 and 1880, before the company merged with others in 1901 to form Imperial Tobacco, the world\u2019s fourth-largest cigarette company. In 1908, Wills, then aged 80, promised \u00a3100,000 to fund a university for the city. The following year, with the university granted a royal charter, Wills was named as its first chancellor. The building was opened in 1925 as a memorial to Wills by his sons, George and Henry Wills IV. Arguing that Wills became chancellor \u201cafter financing the university with slave-profited money\u201d, the petitioners challenge the institution \u201cto uphold its commitment to diversity and inclusivity and revise the name of the building \u2026 let us break free from Bristol\u2019s homogeneous toleration of slave profiteers and name the building after somebody the entire university population can be proud of\u201d. But the allegation that Wills made its money from slave-grown tobacco is disputed both by Imperial and by scholars. \u201cIt\u2019s good that we have these little debates,\u201d says Horton, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing students like better than a political controversy but the slavery connection isn\u2019t that strong with Wills. The truth is that we may never know.\u201d Sitting on a square of lawn outside the Wills Memorial Building on a bright, blustery Friday lunchtime, Samuel March, a second-year computer science student at the university, puts his lunch aside to consider the proposition. \u201cMy understanding is that they weren\u2019t slave traders,\u201d he says. \u201cThe petition isn\u2019t going to achieve anything, it\u2019s pointless, like they\u2019re trying to change history. And anyway,\u201d he adds, \u201cI don\u2019t use the building very often. It\u2019s for the lawyers.\u201d Kellie Horder, who works nearby, was more sympathetic to the petition, which by Saturday had attracted 516 supporters. \u201cI can understand it,\u201d she says. \u201cI get why people would be pissed off about the name. It\u2019s terrible. Let\u2019s not give the name that power any more. The petition provokes a conversation about why things were wrong. I like it if conversations are had about it. History isn\u2019t a reliable thing, it\u2019s a narrative someone wants to tell.\u201d The Great Wills Memorial Building Brouhaha, as it may come to be known, comes in the wake of the furore over the statue of Cecil Rhodes in Oxford. It also has a companion in the form of what locals are prone to term \u201cthe Colston issue\u201d, the debate that has been rumbling away since the late 1990s over the suitability of the name of the philanthropist, merchant and slave trader Edward Colston adorning the facade of city institutions, from schools to a window in the cathedral to, most notably, a city-centre statue and the city\u2019s leading music venue, the Colston Hall. With the venue undergoing a major refurbishment, the time is right, argue many, for a change of name. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel comfortable in that place, don\u2019t go in there,\u201d says Ros Martin. \u201cBut you know, it matters. Come on! We\u2019re artists, this is important! We\u2019re talking about trading on the profits of a 17th-century slave merchant.\u201d For Martin, a prolific local writer and artist who has been central in voicing opposition to the Colston name through the Countering Colston website, it\u2019s about more than a name. \u201cIt\u2019s about the psychology of the city,\u201d she says, \u201cwhat we tell ourselves about ourselves. Quite often people don\u2019t know about the history of the city, or because we are bequeathed the city like it is, we just pass through it because this is what we\u2019ve been left. But what do we want to leave? It would be good if we thought about what we want to bequeath.\u201d Colston, Wills and the rest \u2013 and there are many others in a city whose past is predicated on the efficiency of slavery \u2013 provide the key to unlocking the history of Bristol, to illuminating what went before. \u201cThe bottom line is about the memory of our African ancestors and how they are being remembered,\u201d says Martin. \u201cThere are missing voices.\u201d The memorials to those voices, the reminders that the city is so dependent on the slave trade for its wealth and status, are scarce: two plaques (one at ankle height, the other privately funded), a footbridge and a subdued display at M Shed, a city museum, occupying a corner of a gallery on the first floor. Yet all around, the symbols of the trade are present: St Mary Redcliffe church, overlooking the thriving dockside bars and restaurants, from where the bells rang out in celebration of the defeat of the bill to abolish slavery in 1791; the Bathurst Basin, named after the family, still prominent in the area today, who were investors with Colston in the Royal African Company, led the city\u2019s opposition to the abolition of the slave trade and were among those to receive thousands of pounds in compensation for the loss of their slaves following abolition. As one local adage has it: \u201cThere is not a brick in the city but what is cemented with the blood of a slave.\u201d Dr Madge Dresser, a historian and research fellow at the University of the West of England, moved to Bristol in the early 1970s from California by way of London, and she too was struck by the missing voices. \u201cThere really was a denial of the history of slavery in Bristol. In the mid-1990s there was the Festival of the Sea, a celebration of the city\u2019s maritime past, and not a dickie-bird was mentioned about the slave trade.\u201d Now Dresser, who organised an exhibition in the late 1990s to help redress the balance, bashfully admits to having a part to play in the fuss over the Wills Memorial Building. \u201cI feel a little responsible because I taught a course at the university on Bristol and the slave trade and tobacco,\u201d she says, sipping tea in her sitting room on the edge of the city, \u201cand lo and behold \u2026 \u201d \u201cStatues are in a way a diversion,\u201d she continues, \u201cbut perhaps these issues would not have been raised had the monuments not been there as a lightning rod. It\u2019s not just apportioning guilt. It\u2019s about acknowledging the messiness of history and confronting our demons. And it\u2019s also really interesting: the slavery period is the beginning of the global economy and all the dilemmas that presents us with.\u201d One of the reasons this matters, according to Horton, why Bristol has to take steps to acknowledge its history, is because of the decisive role the city had to play in that beginning. \u201cThe key thing about the Bristol slave trade is that Bristol invented how to do it on an industrial scale,\u201d he says. \u201cBristol merchants worked out how to do it as a triangle: brass to Africa, slaves to the Caribbean and the American South, sugar back to Bristol to be processed.\u201d Only a tiny number of slaves actually set foot in Bristol. Yet while the other sides of the triangular trade have taken steps to make amends with the past, Bristol has failed to do so. \u201cIn West Africa you see forts that are part of the process of commemoration,\u201d says Horton. \u201cIf you go to the Caribbean, you can see likewise that the plantations are preserved as heritage sites and in acknowledgement of slavery. But when we come to this city, the organising fulcrum of this horrifying trade, there is nothing, and yet around us, from 1700 to 1806, around 565,000 Africans were ripped out of their homeland and put on ships funded by Bristol merchants. Some 450,000 survived.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
