In a deal, the details of which will be confirmed today, Cerberus European Investments is paying \u00a3204.4m for the company's business, which employs 2,500 staff. The cash means Torex's banking consortium, lead by Royal Bank of Scotland, will receive the majority of the \u00a3202m it has loaned the business. Torex's advisers for the recent sale will also receive their \u00a312m in fees. While trade creditors of Torex Retail, which is still the subject of a Serious Fraud Office inquiry, will be moved over into the new business, bondholders who lent it about \u00a365m, and shareholders will get nothing because the London-listed business has been put into administration. KPMG is understood to have been appointed to deal with the administration. Shares in Torex Retail have been suspended since January when the then relatively new chief executive Neil Mitchell was forced to issue a shock profits warning, saying turnover for 2006 was likely to be \"significantly below expectations\". On the same day he took a dossier of internal documents to the SFO, which raided the homes of Torex Retail's then chairman Chris Moore, his predecessor, and that of another business associate. Shortly afterwards former NHS IT executive Keith Taylor took over from Mr Mitchell and Mr Moore left the company. The state of Torex Retail's accounts has been unclear for some time. In fact the company will today admit that revenues were \u00a3246m last year with operating profits of a mere \u00a34.2m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
