As an item on the public spending bill, that's not huge - little more than 1%. But as it is more than anyone else in the country lays out on computers, and shows no sign of decreasing, it is worth asking what the spending is for. The conventional answer is to improve the government machine. The money goes on services, software and hardware to help deliver (sic) more effective public services. We're buying doctors the kit to call up X-rays electronically rather than on film and allowing police officers to spend more time on the street, not in the canteen. At another level, the IT is supposed to cut the cost of running government's back offices, so we can either employ fewer civil servants or give them more useful things to do. All this is part of the prime minister's strategy that aims to \"transform\" public services. No doubt this transformation is worthwhile. But by concentrating exclusively on putting its own office in order, the government neglects another potential outcome of public spending: to nurture the British IT industry. Nearly every other government has such a goal, albeit with varying degrees of openness. Here, senior officials make it a point of pride that they have moved beyond nationalistic concerns. In the Cabinet Office's Transformational Government strategy, the idea that nurturing domestic industry is a legitimate goal of government IT policy merits not a single line. Some significant government IT programmes have been designed with the opposite aims - the massive NHS IT programme, whose procurement processes received a nod of approval from the National Audit Office last week, deliberately set out to replace local IT suppliers with \"industrial strength\" multinationals. In a typical exercise in joined-up government, the Department of Trade and Industry was trying to promote UK healthcare informatics companies overseas at the very time the Department of Health was deciding they were not good enough for the NHS. When I ask the people who run the government's IT projects what they can do to put business in the way of UK companies, they generally react as if I have suggested rolling a joint in their office - it is a possibility simply not on their agenda. I am not suggesting offering special treatment for British business. Like smoking dope in the Cabinet Office, that would generate certain legal difficulties, as well as being thoroughly antisocial. It would not even be good for the businesses concerned - certainly the Fujitsu IT company has a higher international reputation nowadays than it did when, as the UK \"national champion\" ICL, it collected government IT contracts according to Buggins' turn. But if outright protectionism is out, another option is exercised by many free-trading governments. This is to ensure that a percentage of government IT spending goes to start-ups and other small businesses. Small businesses generally, though not necessarily in the information age, operate close to home. The US government seems to regard supporting small business as a worthwhile policy objective: the federal government's General Services Association will this year reserve contracts worth up to $250 billion to small and medium-sized enterprises. Many other governments, notably Canada and the Netherlands, parcel out government contracts in lots rarely exceeding a million dollars. The UK has no such policy. One distinctive feature of HMG's IT policy is its enthusiasm for mega-contracts, worth hundreds of millions or billions of pounds. As a result, four fifths of government IT spending goes to 11 contractors, nearly all of which are based overseas. Although in the short term these contracts look efficient, especially if they involve transferring risk to a well-resourced private contractor, they have longer-term costs. One is that a nation cannot live by cutting costs alone, and strong IT companies are excellent at generating wealth. After all, EDS was a start-up once. Second, there is a correlation between governments taking the \"small parcel\" approach and success in IT. While the DTI this week launched a website collating information on government contracts to make life easier for small companies to bid, this falls a long way short of guaranteeing them the work. Finally, there is the matter of public support. The government's programme of IT-based reforms, whether electronic health records, shared \"back office\" services and identity cards, is controversial. One way to generate engagement for the programme would be to assure the public that the commercial benefits from it will flow to Birmingham as well as Bermuda. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
