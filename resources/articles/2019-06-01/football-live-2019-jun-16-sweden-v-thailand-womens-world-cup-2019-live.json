You may notice the USA have changed the lineup. A lot. So NOW they\u2019re resting players. And I\u2019ll stick by 1-0. That\u2019s all for me -- enjoy Tom\u2019s coverage here: StickSports fan also congratulates me on the 5-1 prediction and says it\u2019s OK if I show my dance atop my desk. I\u2019ve lost 30 pounds in 18 months, but I still don\u2019t think my desk would support me. We have a game report ... Predictions Tuvic Tuslow raves that I got my second-half prediction correct by saying Sweden would score again (or twice more) and Thailand might score one. And ... huh. I did. That doesn\u2019t happen often. So, I\u2019m asked, what\u2019s my prediction for USA-Chile? 1-0. Yes. 1-0. Assuming Endler makes a couple of early saves. If she doesn\u2019t, then 6-0. So what\u2019s the difference here between USA-Thailand and Sweden-Thailand? Simply put, Thailand improved. Sweden could easily have exceeded the USA\u2019s tally of three goals in the first half if not for Boonsing. Against the USA, poor goalkeeping contributed to an outright dam break, and if you\u2019ve been on the receiving end of many a blowout, you know the number of goals after that hardly matters. \u201cBut this is the World Cup,\u201d you might say. \u201cA team should be able to hold it together mentally!\u201d Not when few of your players have experience outside the domestic league of Thailand. Thailand managed to get the ball forward and make Sweden respect their counterattack. That made the second half play out a bit differently. The USA would have been a strong favorite against Sweden in whatever odds were made two weeks ago. Those odds shouldn\u2019t change based on comparing these two games. If the USA hammer five goals past Chile, then we\u2019ll talk. Even then, Sweden might be in the USA\u2019s heads after 2016. Sweden closes the game with (according to ESPN\u2019s stats) 35 shots to Thailand\u2019s five. That\u2019s 12 shots on goal, but Boonsing saved five. Boonsing guesses correctly, but the ball is well-struck into the lower left corner with the last kick of the game. Our first of the match comes deep in stoppage time. They want to see if Thailand handled the ball. It\u2019s a header that hits the arm of the unlucky Chinwong, who was running to her left and was moving her arm as someone running normally would. The close-range header hits the arm, and after a check, the ref points to the spot. Again, Sweden lose track of Thailand\u2019s best attacker, and she rips it near post past Lindahl. A wonderful moment for the underdogs. 90 min: The ever-dangerous Sung-Ngoen gets space on the right. With Sembrant closing and no teammates in sight, the Thai forward shoots high. 88 min: Dangda leaves her arm out in an \u201cunnatural position,\u201d and the ball clangs off it. That\u2019ll be a free kick from 28 yards out. The referee sees many things she does not like and moves around to correct them before allowing Rubensson to take the kick. Boonsing can\u2019t find it, but the ball is cleared out. 84 min: A foul 35 yards out gives Thailand a free kick. Phancha sends a harmless-looking ball into the box, but a teammate saves it near the endline and tries to send it back across, only to see Lindahl alertly collect it. At the other end, an exquisitely timed Chinwong tackle stops the Swedish counter. 82 min: That\u2019s deflating for Thailand, as is the departure of Orathai Srimanee, who is grimacing as she leaves. Orapin Waen-Ngoen is the replacement, and she immediately sends a through ball for Sung-Ngoen. Lindahl races out to collect it. Solid cross after a nifty give-and-go on the left flank, emphatically headed into the net from 10 yards out. 77 min: Sweden get five players within eight yards of the goal, but Anveg\u00e5rd puts it in the side netting. She then makes way for Mimmi Larsson. That\u2019s all three subs. Thailand still have two to make. 75 min: Sung-Ngoen gets space on the flank again. Her cross goes through, but Thailand retain possession. Nild plays wide, but it all ends with an overly ambitious effort that will do nothing but tick over Thailand\u2019s shot count. 72 min: Janogy with a few moves on the ball, and her shot is blocked ... by Schough, the Swedish substitute. Probably not the instant impact Schough wanted. 68 min: Tuvic Tuslow offers a prediction of a 4-0 final here. I\u2019ll say five. I think Janogy will be difficult to contain. And maybe Thailand will get one? Fischer has to slide to stop a run from Intamee, and the ball bounces toward a grateful Lindahl. Sweden substitution: Captain Caroline Seger departs, handing the armband to Asllani on her way out, and she\u2019s replaced by Olivia Schough. 65 min: Janogy fights for the ball at the near post and fights with the ref after the ball is ruled to have gone off her out of play. Goal difference update: By this time in the USA-Thailand game, the USA had seven goals. Sweden are stuck on three. 63 min: A break for Thailand. Sung-Ngoen swipes the ball from Seger and is off to the races on the left. She opts to wait for more players to arrive. They do, but they\u2019re all Swedish. That doesn\u2019t help. 62 min: Hurtig commits a foul while trying to reclaim the ball. After the whistle, she shows a bit of petulance and kicks it a few yards forward. The ref allows it. 60 min: If Sweden are thinking about getting 10 more goals to even out the goal difference, they\u2019re not playing that way. They\u2019re still working on their game. Patient buildup leading to quality shots. You know -- the things they\u2019ll need against the USA and in the knockout rounds. I see plenty of tank tops in the stands. Play resumes, and Hurtig is waved back on. 57 min: StickSports Fan again: \u201cNot celebrating would have been patronising and more insulting. Be critics about the actual football, not such irrelevant stuff please!\u201d OK. Jill Ellis should have taken Morgan and Rapinoe, both of whom have a lot of miles on their legs, out of the game for a bit of rest instead of leaving them out there to pile on, because goal difference clearly isn\u2019t going to make a difference in the USA\u2019s fortunes here, while Morgan and Rapinoe\u2019s health absolutely will. Thailand brings on Orathai Srimanee for Thongsombut. Then Hurtig joins Boonsing in the \u201cpainful shot at close range\u201d club, taking one smack to the face. She\u2019s down. 53 min: Two more shots -- Hurtig sends a header just wide off a corner, and Glas takes a mild shot from the top of the area than Boonsing easily snares. Abhijato Sensarma takes me up on my halftime discussion query: \u201cWhat should we talk about at half-time you ask? Okay, here\u2019s my question - what\u2019s the best kit of this World Cup in your opinion?\u201d I\u2019ll say South Africa. Thailand\u2019s trainer is out to take a look at Boonsing, who\u2019s feeling the effects of a shot she had no chance of saving with her hands. Looks like she\u2019ll stay in. One of Thailand\u2019s backups, by the way, plays in the USA at Kennesaw State. That\u2019s a college. 47 min: And right away, Janogy is quick to pounce on a loose ball and smashes it from six yards out. Unfortunately for her and perhaps for Boonsing, the Thai keeper is right there to absorb the brunt of it. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t play soccer any more. (That and my Achilles.) Teams are back on the field as we get a glimpse of Rolf\u00f6 eating a banana. She\u2019s been replaced by Madelen Janogy, who was superb off the bench when Sweden finally broke through Chile\u2019s defense after a weather delay. Scott Bassett writes: \u201cSweden are now ON PACE to equal the 13 goals of the US, since that game, if memory serves, was 3-0 at half time. However, their celebrations are simply not extreme enough. They need to really up their antics if they want to win the disgrace derby. Come on Sweden! You can do it!\u201d Since people want to keep talking about this, here\u2019s a question: Are the USA\u2019s celebrations simply the sign of a team that has a level of tenacity and competitiveness that others don\u2019t have? The rationale that the U.S. women were merely celebrating the first goals of newbies Mallory Pugh and Rose Lavelle doesn\u2019t hold water. Lavelle scored the USA\u2019s seventh goal (her second). Pugh scored No. 11. The rest were all from the long-familiar names -- Morgan, Rapinoe, Lloyd. Maybe it\u2019s just that the same ruthlessness and single-mindedness that led to these celebrations is also the same set of traits that helps the USA succeed? Or maybe not. Only so much armchair psychology we can do. StickSports Fan, who\u2019s either excited about the St. Louis Blues\u2019 Game 7 victory (which I also brought to you via the magic of The Guardian\u2019s live-commentary system) or the start of pro lacrosse season, has an interesting theory ... \u201cMaybe Sweden are just appearing sloppy, but in reality they are...ahem... trying not to celebrate as much because they fear facing irrational wrath from international media over their actions? Who knows.....\u201d I don\u2019t think so. They\u2019ve shot 20 times (Fox says 18, ESPN says 20), on pace to match the USA\u2019s tally against Thailand. The first celebration was a nice pile-up in front of the goal. The next two celebrations weren\u2019t notable. The last meaningful kick is from Anveg\u00e5rd, who produces a solid save from Boonsing, who has surely repaid her coach\u2019s faith in her. So what shall we talk about at halftime? 44 min: Hurtig drops after a rough challenge from Dangda. Our referee plays the advantage. Sweden is not inclined to take it. Dangda receives a yellow and will miss the next and surely final game of this Cup for Thailand. I believe we had a new Laws-mandated one-way drop ball, but the TV cameras declined to show us. The ball pings in and out of the Thai penalty area and falls to Rolf\u00f6, who takes a touch to the top of the arc. Her previous efforts have been lacking. This one isn\u2019t. It\u2019s drilled with some authority. Boonsing does very well to get a hand to it, but she can\u2019t keep it out. That\u2019s a goal to celebrate. 41 min: Sung-Ngoen goes 1v4, shrugs off a challenge and slices a cross toward a well-marked teammate. 39 min: All that said, the shot count is 16-1 in Sweden\u2019s favor. Charles Antaki writes: \u201cThe TV director occasionally cuts to the Thai bench to show a very cool looking woman in an expensive and ostentatiously non-sporting outfit, who the commentator claims is a billionaire who bankrolls the national team. If England had such a person they certainly wouldn\u2019t look so cool - it would be a sweaty, overweight businessman on his mobile phone - say Mike Ashley or, if were truly unlucky, Sir Philip Green.\u201d The USA should counter with Rihanna. 37 min: This is looking like an actual game of soccer, with each team having some possession in midfield and patiently seeking a way through. Thailand\u2019s wildest dream would be just to score once here, but this is competent football. Or, as the English called it until the Americans also started using that name, soccer. 34 min: Sweden concede a free kick in their own half. It lands just shy of the area, but Thailand appear to have forced a corner kick until the AR\u2019s flag goes up. Replay (not VAR) shows the call to be correct, because we ARs are awesome. (Legs still sore from yesterday.) I\u2019m not sure what this is, especially because I\u2019m not getting any sound with it, but I\u2019m mesmerized ... 32 min: Free kick goes the middle of the box again, but it\u2019s farther away from goal, and Eriksson\u2019s header sails over the bar. 31 min: The through ball was on for Sweden, but they botched it. In 2016, Sweden clinically converted on the few chances they had against the USA. This team simply doesn\u2019t appear to be on that level. But we should remember -- the bulk of the USA\u2019s goals were after halftime. This could still fall to pieces for Thailand, and Nild just gave up a needless free kick 28 yards out. 29 min: A pair of Swedish corner kicks produces nothing but a foul. Here\u2019s that Asllani goal: Luke Jones writes: \u201cNormally in a game like this in a big tournament the stands would be full of locals who turned out to cheer for Thailand, or maybe see a historically lopsided defeat. It really is too bad that FIFA or the organizers or whoever made that impossible.\u201d The crowd did seem sparse when the teams walked onto the pitch, but we can see a few pockets of supporters creating a bit of noise when either team has the ball. It\u2019s surely better attendance than Sweden had when it hosted. (In fairness, that was 24 years ago. Women\u2019s soccer has progressed a bit since then.) 25 min: But Sweden, frankly don\u2019t seem up for it. A sloppy pass here and there, then a terrific tackle from Chinwong. And as I type that, Chinwong loses track of Asllani, who can\u2019t direct a pinpoint cross into the net. They\u2019ve been a little wasteful, this Swedish team. If they score against the USA, that would probably send off some alarm bells. 23 min: Rolf\u00f6 with another rash shot. Reminder: Sweden must score, say, 12 goals to put any pressure on the USA in the Battle of Goal Difference. 22 min: Say this for Thailand -- they\u2019re trying to get numbers forward, and they\u2019ve been successful in getting into the opposing third twice, along with a bit of midfield possession. Doesn\u2019t matter who the opposition is -- that was lovely. Hurtig\u2019s header floats toward the far post and forces Boonsing to stretch for a nice save. Asllani collects it with no angle to shoot, then creates an angle to shoot. 2-0. 18 min: A good cross from Hurtig to a spot with two Swedish forwards and two Thai defenders occupying the same spot of grass. The carom is not on goal. 16 min: Shot for Thailand! And it\u2019s not a bad one at all. Sweden can\u2019t break up a Thailand possession, and the ball is crossed back to Nild at the top of the box. Her shot whistles high, but that wasn\u2019t bad. Sweden roars forward in response but produces only a tame shot. Fox kindly shows us the goal ... From email: Someone apparently thinks I\u2019m a European racist black lady. I\u2019d be OK with three of those things, but I am none. I thought we were letting the celebration thing drop ... 12 min: Swedish possession, Swedish possession, corner, foul, goal kick, and ... Thailand possession! Sung-Ngoen gets around the defense and crosses. Sweden forced to clear under pressure. 9 min: Save! OK, it\u2019s somewhat routine, as Rolf\u00f6 fires from the top of the area. But it\u2019s a save. Sweden reclaims the ball, and Rolf\u00f6 gets into the middle of the box, doing the hard work of beating four defenders but putting her shot nowhere near much of anything. Free kick from 35 yards out from the Phancha foul, and it\u2019s fair to say Sweden is going to be better in the air. Rubensson floats it to Sembrant -- defender\u2019s goal! 5 min: Phancha fouls Hurtig and immediately puts her hands up as it to bow or pray. 4 min: Decent chance here, with Eriksson playing a good cross to Asllani, who gets her head or torso to it but can\u2019t direct it goalward. 2 min: At the 1:01 mark, a Thai defender touches the ball. It\u2019s out for a throw-in. Asllani gets impatient and fires from outside the box to the periphery of the stadium. Kickoff: Looks like a lovely day in Nice. And now that the India-Pakistan match has been suspended due to ... you guessed it, rain ... you have no excuse to skip this one. Sweden\u2019s lineup Two changes up front, though supersub Madelen Janogy remains on the bench. Instead, Lina Hurtig and Anna Anveg\u00e5rd replace Sofia Jakobsson and Stina Blackstenius. Lineup, with clubs: GK 1-Hedvig Lindahl (Chelsea) D: 6-Magdalena Eriksson (Chelsea) D: 3-Linda Sembrant (Montpellier) D: 5-Nilla Fischer (Wolfsburg) D: 4-Hanna Glas (PSG) M: 17-Caroline Seger (Rosengard) M: 21-Elin Rubensson (Kopparbergs/G\u00f6teborg) M: 18-Fridolina Rolf\u00f6 (Bayern Munich) M: 9-Kosovare Asllani (Linkopings) M: 8-Lina Hurtig (Linkopings) F: 19-Anna Anveg\u00e5rd (Vaxjo) You can also call Rolf\u00f6 and Hurtig forwards if you like. Honestly, isn\u2019t the difference between a 4-5-1 and a 4-3-3 basically a matter of attitude? You could say Thailand\u2019s in a 4-3-3, but does anyone think they\u2019ll have three players pressing forward? Players in The Guardian\u2019s top 100: Fischer, Seger, Rolf\u00f6, Asllani. Also Blackstenius, who has moved to the bench. From Twitter: Cena was terrific in the Amy Schumer film Trainwreck. Before a nice feature on Nild, the pregame coverage on Fox included a rant from rasslin\u2019 star Hulk Hogan. It must work. After the Coca-Cola Hometown Heroes segment on Crystal Dunn, one of my awesome kids brought me a Coke. It\u2019s Father\u2019s Day, you know. Thailand\u2019s player to watch And we already have an email. Here\u2019s Tim Farnham: \u201cCan you just grow up and move on and do your job and cover Sweden - Thailand, please? You\u2019d think you had a complex about the US - Thailand match or something.\u201d I\u2019m 49 years old. But the last comment on the USA-Thailand game here (barring the occasional \u201ca sub is coming in -- she was a starter against the USA\u201d note) will be this: The player Alex Morgan consoled after that game was Miranda Nild. What do Morgan and Nild have in common, besides that moment? They\u2019re both Cal-Berkeley alumni. Nild finished her outstanding playing career in 2018. So Nild isn\u2019t just the recipient of a good show of sportsmanship from Morgan. She came up through the U.S. women\u2019s soccer gauntlet and excelled. Thailand lineup A few changes from the 0-13 decision against the USA, including the goalkeeper. New players get an asterisk. GK: 1-Waraporn Boonsing* D: 10-Sunisa Srangthaisong, 19-Pitsamail Sornsai*, 3-Natthakarn Chinwong, 5-Ainon Phancha M: 12-Rattikan Thongsombut, 8-Miranda Nild, 6-Pikul Khueanpet*, 7-Silawan Intamee, 17-Taneekarn Dangda* F: 21-Kanjana Sung-Ngoen Khueanpet was a first-half sub against the USA. Dangda was a second-half sub. Dangda had a hat trick in the game against Indonesia, as did Saowalak Pengngam, who\u2019s on the bench. When Thailand scored 13 ... May 27, 2018. Indonesia hosting Thailand. Your goal scorers: Dangda, Saengchan, Saengchan, Intamee, Dangda, Phancha, Boothduang, Dangda, Intamee, Pengngam, Pengngam, Pengngam, Chuchuen. The celebrations were subdued. Even somber. Maybe they watch American baseball, and they know that people who celebrate home runs a bit too much in a rout (or even in a close win) end up taking a fastball in the ribs. Welcome to the Battle of Goal Difference, the most anticipated television event since the Battle of Winterfell. If Sweden do not win by at least 12 goals, taking their goal difference to +14, they\u2019ll need to hope the USA fail to score more than one against Chile. The latter is actually possible, given the presence of Chile\u2019s outstanding goalkeeper Christiane Endler. And if either team falters, then they\u2019ll have more at stake because they\u2019ll need a win rather than a tie to win the group and keep themselves on course for an expected quarterfinal matchup with France. Wait. Is this really a thing to desire? Is it worth scoring a zillion goals rather than resting Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe? OK, OK. We\u2019ll let it go. Here\u2019s Sweden-Thailand. Enjoy. Beau will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s Eni Aluko on that defeat for Thailand: I have to say I\u2019ve been surprised to see some of the reaction to the USA team\u2019s celebrations during the 13\u20110 win against Thailand. I think some of it is to do with the fact that they aren\u2019t the most popular team out there \u2013 there\u2019s this perception that the USA are arrogant and everything is excessive and over the top with them. But there is also a perception that women\u2019s football should be all hugs, smiles and kisses \u2013 people do not expect a level of ruthlessness they might see in the men\u2019s game. That kind of win-at-all-costs attitude is perhaps something people don\u2019t expect from women. There\u2019s still that unspoken rule that everything should be all \u201cnicely\u2011nicely\u201d but listen: this is a World Cup. The ruthlessness of the USA team is what every other side in France should aspire to have too. That\u2019s why they are the defending champions. I don\u2019t really understand the concept that they shouldn\u2019t have celebrated, because it would have been an even bigger disrespect to not celebrate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
