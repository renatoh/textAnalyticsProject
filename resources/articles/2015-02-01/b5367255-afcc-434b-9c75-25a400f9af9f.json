Woods, the world No62, shot a career-worst 82 to miss the cut at the Phoenix Open by 12 this month and was playing poorly at Torrey Pines the next week when he withdrew after 11 holes because of tightness in his back. Woods said on Wednesday on his website that the issue is not related to the back surgery he had last spring but he is having therapy every day. He hopes to contest the Honda Classic from 26 February but will not do so if his game is not in shape. \u201cThe last two weeks have been very disappointing to me, especially Torrey, because I never want to withdraw,\u201d Woods wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, lately injuries have made that happen too often. This latest injury is not related to my previous surgery. I am having daily physical therapy and I am feeling better every day. \u201cRight now, I need a lot of work on my game, and to still spend time with the people that are important to me. \u201cMy play, and scores, are not acceptable for tournament golf. Like I\u2019ve said, I enter a tournament to compete at the highest level, and when I think I\u2019m ready, I\u2019ll be back. \u201cNext week I will practice at Medalist and at home getting ready for the rest of the year. I am committed to getting back to the pinnacle of my game. I\u2019d like to play The Honda Classic \u2013 it\u2019s a tournament in my hometown and it\u2019s important to me \u2013 but I won\u2019t be there unless my game is tournament-ready. That\u2019s not fair to anyone. I do, however, expect to be playing again very soon. \u201cI want to thank the fans in Phoenix and San Diego. They were amazing. I greatly appreciate everyone\u2019s support.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
