But he is also one of radio's most influential editors - and that is why his views are causing such anxiety for his bosses. And why his future, which could be decided this weekend, has far-reaching implications for the future of the BBC. Last week's row about the right of the Today editor, Rod Liddle, to express his political views in print has exposed serious tensions inside the BBC. His fate over the next few days will be testament to the fact that Gavyn Davies, the chairman of the corporation's board of governors and a close friend of Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, is very rattled indeed. He fears that Liddle's outburst in the pages of the Guardian may have undermined his campaign to safeguard the autonomy of the BBC. Davies is anxious to rebut even the merest whiff of a suggestion of political bias at the BBC. As a Labour supporter himself, he is vulnerable to such accusations and has been deeply worried about how they might impact on the corporation's ability to stay independently regulated. Then, unfortunately, along came Liddlegate. Two weeks ago the name Rod Liddle would have drawn a blank with Joe and Joanna Public. Now the Today editor is close to becoming the centre of a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, thanks to the furore which surrounded comments he made in his Guardian column last Wednesday. A call from Have I Got News For You cannot be far off. For those not familiar with the Liddle story, a brief recap: Liddle used his column to attack the Countryside March and, by implication, the Tories of the nation. 'You may... have forgotten why you voted Labour in 1997. But then you catch a glimpse of the forces supporting the Countryside Alliance: the public schools that laid on coaches; the fusty belch-filled dining rooms of the London clubs that opened their doors, for the first time, to the protesters; the Prince of Wales, and, of course, Camilla: and suddenly, rather gloriously, it might be that you remember once again,' Liddle snarled. Predictably, his polemic infuriated the Daily Telegraph, which used an editorial to accuse Liddle of 'blatant bias, animus and even party allegiance while running an important news programme for the corporation whose charter insists on the absence of all three'. The Telegraph went on to highlight how Today had failed to report the 400,000-strong march in Monday's edition. The inference many of the paper's readers would have drawn was that Liddle was guilty of foisting his own political views on Today. The story polarised opinion: it was Islington versus the Shires; the hip young gunslinger in a shoot-out with Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells. 'The BBC's coverage of the Countryside March was a bit lacklustre, and then you got Rod mouthing off about it in freewheeling terms and it was inevitable that there would be some kind of negative reaction,' said a close associate of Liddle. By Thursday night an angry corporation had given Liddle an ultimatum: lose the column or lose us. 'Rod is a very good bloke, but he stepped out of some pretty well-established rules,' said a friend. 'The BBC has had similar problems in the past, but usually these could be avoided by talking to the employee and making them understand that when they're in print they have to play by a different set of rules.' Liddle has yet to make up his mind on which way to jump. However, it seems he does have doubts over his future at Today. 'I do love writing, but I don't think any form of writing is going to be compatible with the Today job, especially the way I write. I adore the Today programme, and they have all been so wonderful about it, about all this. But equally I have done it for longer than any other recent editor,' he said this weekend. Liddle recently made the gossip columns when a neighbour gave him a black eye following an argument over a Millwall Football Club shirt. And this spring the writer Frederick Forsyth argued that the decision to drop his opinion slots on Today's Saturday programme was evidence of Liddle's left-wing bias. But the latest allegations are much harder to deflect and have caused deep anxiety for Davies. The Chairman's concern centres on the looming creation of Ofcom, the new media watchdog, a subject on which he and Greg Dyke, the director-general, don't see eye to eye. While Dyke is uncharacteristically relaxed and 'sees it as inevitable in the long run', according to one well-placed source, Davies is determined to resist this threat to the corporation's independent status. The issue has become all the more sensitive since Lord Puttnam, the film-maker charged with responding to the Government's Communications Bill, has called for the governors' role to be scaled down. What's more, commercial rivals are urging that Auntie should be subject to the same rules as they are. 'It's something we will look at when we start the review of the BBC's charter in 2004,' said a government source. A close friend of Gordon Brown, the millionaire ex-banker Davies is acutely aware of how dangerous it would be for the corporation to be seen genuflecting before the Government. 'Davies is terrified this is something the Tories will be able to use to beat up the corporation,' said one rival broadcaster. Such fear in Auntie's highest echelons is not new. Norman Tebbit once turned up to a BBC interview with a duster, claiming it was to 'dust off the bias'. Former party chairman Chris Patten urged Tory party members to complain about the BBC's output. William Hague set up a monitoring unit to check for bias when Dyke arrived. But the Labour-supporting combo of Dyke and Davies at the top of the BBC means accusations about the corporation's political bias are now felt more acutely. Several of the corporation's star broadcasting journalists have been told their musings in print must be vetted by BBC apparatchiks before publication. Liddle's supporters feel he has been singled out unfairly. 'Fergal Keane, Mark Urban, Andrew Marr, John Simpson and John Humphrys (who all write regularly for the broadsheets) are accepted because they fall within the framework of establishment views,' said one Liddle fan. Perhaps, but then none of them is as powerful as Liddle. Despite growing competition from Radio 5, Today continues to be a key show for those who want to reach the chattering classes. One BBC political presenter said that several of those working in news inside the corporation believe any political bias exerted by Liddle had always been potentially more dangerous than that glimpsed in Humphrys and Simpson, or even the apparently euro-sceptic business editor, Jeff Randall, who writes in the Sunday Telegraph's City pages. 'In the case of someone such as John Humphrys, it is possible for people to challenge him on his views, even on air. But with Rod, the influence has always been invisible, at least to the public, and so much harder for people to challenge. He is the gatekeeper, rather than a frontman.' Liddlegate has come at a bad time for Today. Only a few weeks ago the programme came under fire from the Tories. On the eve of his anniversary as party leader, Today lined up two senior Tory party figures - Amanda Platell, William Hague's former spin doctor, and the former chief executive of the party, Archie Norman - to attack Iain Duncan Smith's record before subjecting him to a Humphrys interview. The Tories described the programme as 'a disgracefully one-sided exercise'. Such accusations will be dragged up time and time again and used as brickbats by the programme's critics. These thoughts cannot have escaped Mark Damazer, the head of BBC News, as he held a crisis meeting with Liddle on Friday evening. It is likely Liddle will decide it is time for a change of role. There are plans for him to make a pilot for a new political show for the BBC, aimed at younger audiences. The move would see him front the programme with the radio DJ and journalist, Fi Glover, and would give him a new public profile. But leaving Today would be a wrench and Liddle wants some space to make up his mind. 'I just want a weekend. I am going to go blackberrying with my children and I will maybe make my decision on Sunday night.' A friend said: 'Maybe what's going on with Rod is that he's had enough of the BBC's rules. That's not a crime.' Well, not outside Broadcasting House anyway."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
