His son Scott took what was genuinely a shock victory in the flagship event of the European Tour, the Volvo PGA Championship, beating not only the Argentinian Angel Cabrera by two shots but a field that contained the world No2, Vijay Singh, and No3, Ernie Els. But Scott Drummond, 30, would have had no hope of being at Wentworth, or even playing on tour, were it not for the fact that his father suffered two bad injuries almost 20 years ago, for which he received \u00a390,000 in damages. Large amounts of that money have been ploughed into Scott's career, sustaining him during the many lean periods that preceded his weekend success. And when son embraced father after holing the winning putt, he heard the words from his 70-year-old dad: \"You've made my life.\" George Drummond was once a scratch golfer at St Andrews and when he moved to Shropshire he joined Shrewsbury Golf Club. He worked for the local council as a plumber but two work-related accidents left him with crushed vertebrae and a neck brace. He sued, and won, but his injuries meant no more golf for him and all his energies were channelled into his son's game. Scott, although the son of a Scot, played amateur golf for England and then, in 1996, turned professional and began to play wherever he could, but money was always tight. \"Financially,\" said Scott after winning \u00a3420,000 at Wentworth, \"it has always been very difficult. I've been lucky, though, because my dad has always supported me all the way and made funds available. \"I don't know how he's done it, really, but he always kept me going.\" Drummond failed to get his tour card in 1996 and played the Hippo tour, the Futures and Mastercard tours and did well enough to get a few starts on the Challenge tour. He began to play well and at the end of last year, seven years after turning professional, he finally got his full European Tour card. That, according to him, was the moment for which his father had been waiting. \"He's lived for this,\" said Drummond, \"not this specific moment but for me to get my tour card. Right since I started playing when I was about six years old it's always been his dream for me to get on the tour and play. So now, after winning this, he's going to be uncontrollable, I think.\" Drummond, in winning, went from 435th in the world to 95th and became the latest in a long line of Shropshire players to figure in golf's history books. In recent years alone there have been Sandy Lyle and Ian Woosnam, winners of three major championships between them, Peter Baker, who won on the European Tour and played Ryder Cup golf, and Jonathan Lomas and David Park, who have both won on tour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
