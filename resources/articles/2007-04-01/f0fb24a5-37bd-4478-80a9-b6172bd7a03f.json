Initiatives launched by the Department of Communities and Local Government range from encouraging the teaching of citizenship in Islamic religious schools to creating a \u00a3600,000 faith and social cohesion unit. The unit plans to work with religious institutions, with the aim of preventing extremist groups from taking over mosques. A development programme for leaders from all faiths will be aimed at boosting leadership and communication skills so they can engage better with young people. All imams working for the state in hospitals, colleges and prisons, where young people can be particularly vulnerable to extremist messages, will be required to undergo such training. The DCLG has also given \u00a36m to local authorities for projects such as supporting students excluded from schools, who are believed to be an easy target for extremist recruiters. \"We've concentrated so far, rightly, on the security response, and at all points we have to keep that under review and see whether we need further powers,\" Ms Kelly told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"What I don't think we've really done sufficiently to date is win hearts and minds.\" The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, has also announced plans to use special police and legal teams to target those preaching hate, using anti social behaviour orders where they cannot be prosecuted. The idea follows the successful use of Asbos to stop animal rights extremists from harassing the public, he said. The announcements were welcomed by some British Muslims, including the British Muslim Forum, and Glasgow MP Mohammed Sarwar. \"Being Muslim and British is ... about standing together and confronting those who seek to undermine our common values,\" they said in an open letter. But a Labour peer, Lord Ahmed, attacked the strategy as a superficial rehash of existing policies. Andrew Stunell, Liberal Democrat communities spokesman, said: \"To tackle these problems in British society we must first address the chronic deprivation that allows extremism to breed.\" David Davis, shadow home secretary, said: \"It is time the government stopped talking and started to show some resolution. They should use the laws we already have, including the offences of incitement to commit murder and racial hatred, to deal with those who preach hate.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
