Steve McQueen is the businessman who gets his kicks plotting the perfect caper; but he meets his intellectual and romantic match in Faye Dunaway's cool insurance investigator. Fun With Dick and Jane 12.50pm, 8pm, Sky Movies Comedy (Dean Parisot, 2005) Jim Carrey gets back behind the clown mask after his serious performance in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In this remake of the 70s comedy he's an executive fallen on hard times when sacked by crooked corporation boss Alec Baldwin: to make ends meet, Carrey and wife T\u00e9a Leoni make like a slapstick Bonnie and Clyde, in a cheerful, undemanding comedy. Southern Comfort 10.50pm, Film4 (Walter Hill, 1981) Nine part-time national guardsmen on manoeuvres in the bayous of Louisiana upset the locals by \"borrowing\" their boats and are soon neck-deep in trouble. A classic premise from Hill, whose Vietnam allegory is soaked in atmospheric menace and sudden violence, the mood enhanced by Ry Cooder's Cajun soundtrack. Among the fine ensemble cast are Keith Carradine, Powers Booth and Fred Ward."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
