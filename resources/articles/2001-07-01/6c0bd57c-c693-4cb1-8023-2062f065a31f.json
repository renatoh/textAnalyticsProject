Worst hit are people who bought unit-linked pensions where the value directly reflects the drop in share prices. The London stock market is down almost 20% since January 2000, with most of the drop over the past 12 months. The average UK unit-linked equity pension fund, a sector in which British savers have almost \u00a3100bn invested, is down by 12%, according to figures from Standard &amp; Poors. In other words, someone who was expecting their pension pot to provide an annual retirement income of \u00a38,000 last year will be lucky to see much more than \u00a37,000 a year now. But the average masks much worse performance in some individual funds. Friends Provident, Royal London, M&amp;G, Sun Life and Norwich Union all have unit-linked UK pension funds where values have fallen by between 15% and 20% over the past year. However, many more people have opted instead to save for their retirement through with-profits funds from the big insurers as a safer, lower risk alternative to the unit-linked funds. With-profits funds invest in a mix of shares, property and government bonds, and aim to smooth the ups and downs of the stock market. But these funds are now under intense pressure. Every year the funds add a bonus, which is guaranteed and cannot be taken away no matter what happens to the stock market. When the stock market is strong, bonus allocations are trimmed to put aside capital so that when markets are weaker, bonuses can still be paid. For example, in January this year Norwich Union, now the largest insurer in Britain, earned precisely zero on its giant \u00a355bn with-profits fund, but nonetheless made a bonus allocation. The actuaries who run these with-profits funds are comforted by stock market history, which highlights how rare it is to have two negative years in a row. The last time it happened was in 1974/1975. But if the gloom currently hanging over the stock market is maintained for rest of this year, the once-in-a-generation event looks set to happen again. Insurance companies are now bracing themselves for swinging cuts to bonus allocations when they report back to policyholders, traditionally in January and February. It is not just pensioners who will be hit; with-profits funds are the chief investment vehicle for endowments, suggesting that the shortfalls projected for millions of homeowners are set to lurch even further downwards. With-profit bonds, in which billions of pounds of short-term sav ings have been invested, are also likely to be hit hard. Such is the gravity of the situation that many big insurers have resorted to enacting the market value adjuster (MVA) clause in with-profits contracts, which was regarded by many as a desperate measure. The clause allows an insurance company to cut the values of all policies which are cashed in early to protect the investments of those who stay in the fund. Independent insurance analyst Ned Cazalet predicts that nearly all insurance companies selling with-profits policies will impose MVA penalties amid an \"across the board\" weakening in life office financial strength. \"MVAs quite rightly should be applied. Market values are on the slide and will probably slide further. Without an MVA, an insurance company is effectively paying out more than the market value of a policy, which can only come from one place - other policyholders,\" he said. He added that policyholders need to severely adjust their expectations of future investment growth on their savings. This week Jobs &amp; Money asked the major with-profits providers if they have enacted the MVA clause: Axa: No. \"Not something we have done yet or are contemplating.\" Axa products include policies sold under the names of Sun Life and Equity &amp; Law. Friends Provident: Yes. Has applied an exit penalty since May, on a case-by-case basis. Cuts are up to 5%. Royal &amp; Sun Alliance: Yes and no. Has applied the MVA to with-profit bonds over the past four months, but has not applied it to with-profits pensions. \"At the moment we are not in that territory.\" With-profit bonds taken out in the past two to three years have an MVA as high as 10%. Legal &amp; General: Yes. Enacted on July 9. Cuts of 5%, applied on full or partial surrenders on with-profits pension policies bought after 1986. Norwich Union: Yes. Enacted this week. Cuts of up to 5% on larger (\u00a310,000-plus) withdrawals. \"The MVA will bring payouts back into the range we normally operate in.\" NU includes products sold under the Commercial Union, General Accident and Provident Mutual names. Standard Life: No. \"We feel confident that as a financially strong life office we can weather relatively short periods of poor returns.\" Scottish Mutual: No. \"It is something we are looking at very closely in the light of stock market conditions.\" Scottish Widows: No. \"We are looking at the situation closely and it is something that we cannot rule out in the future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
