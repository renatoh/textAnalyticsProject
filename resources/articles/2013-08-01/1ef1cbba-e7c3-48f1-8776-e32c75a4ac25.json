Why did he do it? And what will be happening behind the scenes? Paxman, direct as ever, says: \"I may keep it or I may shave it off, but I think I'll make my own decision.\" Management may think differently. As a news anchor Michael Buerk, now steward of the Moral Maze on Radio 4, trod this path, returning from holiday with a full beard. \"My tactic was not to mention it and to wait and see what would happen,\" recalled Buerk in his memoir, The Road Taken. Managers filed by for a sneaky look. \"None spoke to me directly. They went off for meetings, but the buck was passed to such good effect that nobody even raised the subject until the middle of the evening.\" Buerk held firm for a while. \"Unfortunately a big story broke late on in the evening, and my editor \u2013 braver than most \u2013 argued that the beard would distract the viewers from what was really important. I gave in, reasonably gracefully, with 10 minutes to go to the programme.\" Still, he had revenge. With five minutes to go, Buerk shouted from his dressing room that excising the growth was proving difficult. \"The choice, I said, lay between having one half of my face shaved and doing the news in profile, or reducing the full set to a \u2013 slightly bloody \u2013 goatee. Which would they prefer?\" In truth he had already removed the lot. The house always wins. \u2022 Though a selected few at the corporation complain that ageism blights their careers, time with the BBC does appear to do wonders for longevity. There is a hardy and growing community of legendary former BBC correspondents who keep in touch and remember what it was like reporting the world before the money men and management theorists mounted their coup. They swap tales and reminisce \u2013 and this week hailed the continuing achievement of Anthony Lawrence, who famously reported for the BBC from east Asia. Lawrence, hailed as one of the BBC's \"greatest generation\" of foreign correspondents, turned 101 on Monday. Friends and former colleagues threw him a party at the Foreign Correspondents' Club, in Hong Kong. Truly the elder statesman. Bearded Paxo looks older but isn't. \u2022 Much finger-wagging at PM Dave following his endorsement of the push to frack the nation \u2013 not just the \"desolate\" north-east, as advocated by his friend Lord Howell, but also the green fields of the lustrous south. To add to the opprobrium, a telling off from Britain's head druid, Philip Carr-Gomm: leader of the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids. \"It's not too late to back away from this,\" advises Carr-Gomm. \"If you do, saving face by saying 'We have listened to concerns', setting up inquiries etc, and then ensuring it never happens, the British people, and history, will perceive you not as weak, but as a champion, a defender, of the landscape of Britain.\" Apart from those on the HS2 route, of course, who will continue to burn him in effigy. No good choices as PM. \u2022 With the imminent arrival of the biopic Rush, depicting the duel between the British motor racing superstar James Hunt and the Austrian Niki Lauda, expect a slew of new material about both. The motoring magazine Octane runs the rule over one of the recent books \u2013 Memories of James Hunt, by Christopher Hilton \u2013 and finds new insight. The most memorable quote, we learn, comes from Autosport's Marcus Pye: \"He was a hooligan. I mean, you probably haven't pissed on the curtain between first class and steerage on an aircraft, have you?\" Not many people have. Hunt did so many things and all of them well. \u2022 Finally, a note from regular correspondent Philip Howells, voicing concern about the recent absence of your diarist. \"It is fortuitous that you have returned, because you were within a whisker of ending up as being claimed by the Home Office as a success for the 'advertising van' in persuading people to live elsewhere than in this country,\" says Philip. \"They'll take anything as a sign of success.\" And this is true \u2013 but Philip, rest easy. If I go, I'm taking Eric Pickles with me. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
