The Fifa president this week told advisers that he wants to change the way tournaments are allocated, a decision that could be rubber-stamped by the executive committee as early as the end of the month. Currently the system is by strict rotation, but the new arrangement will see all continents, bar the hosts of the previous two finals, able to bid. An English bid, which has the support of prime minister Gordon Brown, will face competition from China, Australia, Russia and possibly Italy. Brown's World Cup ambassador, Richard Caborn, is currently considering offers of support from consultancy firms, including one with exceptionally close ties to Blatter. The bid could also be boosted by the announcement that Lord Coe, chairman of Fifa's ethics commission, will act as the watchdog for the bidding process. Coe's role with Fifa has attracted criticism, largely because in the year since its foundation his commission has met only once and, because it cannot act retrospectively, has not tackled any of the serious allegations levelled against Fifa, including those made against the vice-president Jack Warner. Whether Coe was wise to accept the role is questionable but, conscious of the need to make the position meaningful, he met Blatter on Monday to discuss the issue. Coe promised to hold regular meetings of the ethics committee, starting with an investigation into allegations of corruption in the Kenyan refereeing establishment. Inquiry in extra time The City of London Police inquiry into corruption in football is certain to continue well into the new year after the force extended bail conditions to the two men arrested so far. Tottenham's full-back Pascal Chimbonda, arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud, has had his bail extended until the end of this month, and an unnamed 61-year-old arrested in connection with money laundering as part of the same investigation has been bailed until January. Question of funding As sporting bodies digest the implications of yesterday's comprehensive spending review, Sport England was left with more food for thought than most. The department of culture, media and sport, which distributes funds to Sport England, was told that it will receive an inflation-only increase from the Treasury, better than some had feared with a 5% cut mooted. Curiously, Sport England was not listed among the delivery partners in the section of the pre-budget report dealing with the Olympics. The omission will interest governing bodies already struggling to convince SE's chairman, Derek Mapp, that they satisfy the participation targets for funding. An SE spokeswoman said it was unconcerned as its role was covered by sections of the report dealing with health and communities. Watching briefs The culture secretary James Purnell and sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe have solved a dilemma over which major sporting events to attend this weekend by sharing the onerous duties. Purnell will travel to Paris to watch England take on France in the rugby union World Cup, while rugby league fan Sutcliffe will be at Old Trafford for the Super League Grand Final. Neither man will be at England's Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia, though following revelations about Purnell's non-attendance at an official photo-call, a picture of the culture secretary could always be merged into the Wembley crowd if required. The tennis dragnet As tennis's governing bodies meet in London this week to discuss ways of combating match-fixing, the ongoing investigation into alleged corruption in a match between Nikolai Davydenko, and Martin Vassallo Arguello demonstrates the difficulties the game faces. It is understood that the majority of the suspicious bets were placed in Russia and eastern Europe, and tracking them down has required the assistance of specialists with knowledge of the region. Given the game's global reach, the ubiquity of the internet and tennis's unconvincing track record in tackling the nandrolone scandal several years ago, it faces a huge challenge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
