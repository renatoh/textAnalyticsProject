Tel: 02920 488775. Website: jolyons.co.uk First impressions: Superbly located new non-smoking boutique hotel on Cardiff's oldest Georgian terrace, right in front of the city's new Millennium Centre as well as within a few seconds walk of the city's revamped waterfront area. What are the rooms like? Each room is individually designed and all feature quality, solid wood furnishings brought in from all parts of the globe, luxurious drapes and contemporary lighting. The bed test: Large, soft duvet and silky smooth Egyptian cotton sheets along with plump pillows and velvet and bead trimmed cushions, topped off by ornately carved headboards and footboards. The bathroom: Each room has an individually designed split-level bathroom with features varying from slate tiles and a large wet room to an underlit whirlpool bath. The restaurant: Busy and informal with a good smattering of locals and an emphasis on plain, organic food, sourced locally. The menu changes daily. The bar: Full of life, with a very relaxed atmosphere, centred on the large wood-burning stove around which are situated big, leather sofas and chairs from which it is all too easy to drink far more than you intended. What is there to do nearby? Take in a concert at the Millennium Centre (wmc.org.uk for details) which opens next weekend; stroll along the Cardiff Bay waterfront and Mermaid Quay; catch a rugby or football match at the Millennium Stadium; or head up into the nearby Brecon Beacons or along the Glamorgan Heritage Coast. How much? Doubles from \u00a385 per night, penthouse \u00a3125."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
