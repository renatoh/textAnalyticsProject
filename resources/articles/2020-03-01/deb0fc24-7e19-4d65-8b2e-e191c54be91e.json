The next day, she received an email from the prize\u2019s director, Michael Kelleher, informing her that she had been awarded $165,000 (\u00a3141,000). \u201cSitting in bed, wondering about the future, I\u2019d said, aloud, \u2018Help\u2019,\u201d said the 51-year-old, who had never won a poetry prize before. \u201cThe moment Michael told me I\u2019d won, I felt as if what I\u2019d called out had been received. And I am not a religious person.\u201d One of the richest literary awards, the Windham Campbell prizes split $1.32m between eight writers around the world. They were set up by lifelong partners Donald Windham and Sandy M Campbell, to highlight literary achievement and provide writers with the opportunity to focus on their work independent of financial concerns. This year, the eight winners, chosen by an anonymous panel of judges, include Kapil, the author of six poetry collections, who was praised for her exploration of \u201ccrucial questions of trauma, healing and immigration\u201d. Meanwhile, Chinese-born author Yiyun Li\u2019s writing was praised by judges for its \u201cformal beauty, imaginative daring, and intense interest in both the small flames of ordinary lives and the sweeping fires of political and social change\u201d. The other winners include debut Zambian novelist Namwali Serpell, whose novel The Old Drift was published last year, poet Jonah Mixon-Webster, whose writing has tackled the public health crisis in his hometown of Flint, Michigan, and Anne Boyer, the author of a \u201csearingly honest\u201d memoir about her cancer diagnosis, The Undying. \u201cThis is such an exciting group of prize recipients \u2013 so many utterly original voices from so many different places,\u201d said Kelleher. \u201cTo read the work of these eight writers \u2013 seven of them women \u2013 is simply overwhelming.\u201d Serpell discovered she\u2019d won while on campus at Berkeley, University of California, in the middle of a meeting. \u201cI opened my laptop to search for something and found an email with the subject line, \u2018URGENT: Windham Campbell prize\u2019. By the time I could click on it and read that there was great news awaiting me on the other end of a phone, I had only five minutes before my next class,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so honoured to receive this prize \u2013 and with Yiyun Li, a writer I greatly admire. I am treating it as a kind of advance on my next novel, one that doesn\u2019t come from a publishing house and therefore grants me the freedom to write it exactly as I wish.\u201d Since the authors, who also include playwrights Julia Cho and Aleshea Harris and Australian writer Maria Tumarkin, were informed of their wins, coronavirus has caused the world to shut down. Kapil said that all authors were facing financial precariousness. \u201cAs the travel restrictions accrue, this prize makes something possible that would not, perhaps, have been possible otherwise. At the moment, my productivity as a writer is not very high up in my mind, but rather questions of survival and mutual aid.\u201d What kind of writing is possible in a time of crisis? \u201cThat is a question that people have been answering with their bodies all over the world for a very long time,\u201d Kapil said. \u201cBut here we are. Let\u2019s see what unfolds. What is a page for? What is a sentence for? Right now, I don\u2019t know.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
