But they have been undermined by injury problems and Declan Danaher is set to move to open-side flanker to cover for Kieron Dawson. Their habit of changing their entire front row during the second half has also been scuppered by an injury to the prop Neal Hatley. Gloucester's front-row problems run deeper, though. Olivier Azam and Trevor Woodman are both suspended and Phil Vickery's broken hand sidelines him. Henry Paul continues at fly-half with Ludovic Mercier at full-back. Mercier's place-kicking could keep the Cherry and Whites in touch. Harlequins v Leicester Kick-off 2pm today Venue The Stoop TV Sky Sports 3, 1.30pm Leicester's sublime second-half display in the league fixture here four weekends ago when Martin Johnson and Austin Healey each bagged a couple of tries suggests a repeat of last year's cup shock, when Quins beat the Tigers, is unlikely. The withdrawal of Keith Wood and Dan Luger gives Quins even fewer grounds for optimism. Paul Burke is in excellent form at No10, fully deserving his Ireland call-up, but too many of their leading players, notably Will Greenwood and Tony Diprose, are overdue big games. Healey misses the game through suspension and Lewis Moody is out with a hip injury but Tigers hold most of the winning cards. Saracens v Northampton Kick-off 6.30pm today Venue Vicarage Road Both these teams are starting to fire after spluttering through the autumn. Northampton laid waste to Cardiff's European hopes and Saracens' form in the Parker Pen Shield has put their season back on track. Kris Chesney returns to their back row after a long absence with a knee injury and Jannie de Beer is back at fly-half but the Saints appear to have the edge up front with Olivier Brouzet, Andy Blowers and Budge Pountney in outstanding form. They are expected to give a first game to their new South African lock Johan Ackermann while the scrum-half Dom Malone faces a fitness test on a hamstring problem. The Saints, even without Matt Dawson, should march on tonight. Leeds v Newcastle Kick-off 2.30pm tomorrow Venue Headingley The cup-holders Newcastle are licking their wounds after a dreadful week in the Heineken Cup when Leinster beat them in a rearranged game here and three days later they conceded a half-century at Newport. The domestic cup represents a possible salvation and they should overcome a Leeds team who appear to be running out of steam. But Leeds have Braam van Staaten back in their centre and Tom Palmer, one of England's crop of highly promising locks, also returns. Rob Andrew names Jonny Wilkinson and Jamie Noon in his backline while the injured Liam Botham and Andrew Mower are out of their 25-man squad. Leicester and Bath have already lost here but the Falcons should squeeze home."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
