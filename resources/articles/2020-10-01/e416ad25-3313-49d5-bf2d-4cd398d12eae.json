Speaking at a livestreamed press conference, Wonder announced two tracks: Where Is Our Love Song, with the four-time Grammy winner Gary Clark Jr on guitar, and Can\u2019t Put It In the Hands of Fate, featuring the rappers Busta Rhymes, Rapsody, Cordae and Chika. He also mooted a new EP featuring the songs, ahead of a \u201cnew project\u201d called Through the Eyes of Wonder, with \u201clots of songs\u201d already written for the latter. The releases mark a return for the musician to the more political works of earlier in his career, such as 1982\u2019s Front Line, about the Vietnam war, and 1980\u2019s Happy Birthday, which fuelled an ultimately successful campaign to make Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s day of birth a US national holiday. Can\u2019t Put It in the Hands of Fate, which Wonder said originally started out as a guy-and-girl love song, is a socially conscious funk track, driven by a classic Wonder harmonica riff (which somewhat recalls 1976 hit I Wish). He sings of protest until change is made: \u201cYou say you\u2019re sick and tired of us protesting / I say not had enough to make a change \u2026 You say you believe that \u2018all lives matter\u2019 / I say I don\u2019t believe the fuck you do.\u201d Wonder said it was a response to \u201csystemic racism \u2026 every young person is saying this stuff here is unacceptable. We can\u2019t be a united people of the world and have this craziness ... Change is right now \u2013 we can\u2019t put it in the hands of fate.\u201d Amid the renewed reckonings around race in the US and elsewhere, Wonder called for \u201can atonement, not just for a couple of years, but at least three to five years \u2013 we cannot ignore and act like the things in this nation didn\u2019t happen \u2026 We can\u2019t erase them out of the history books. 1619, it happened. The slave trade did happen, Reconstruction did happen, 150 million black people did die, that did happen. The only way I think we can fix it is through our love and respect.\u201d Regarding November\u2019s presidential election, he added: \u201cWe can\u2019t put voting in the hands of fate. The universe is watching us. We\u2019ve got to vote justice in and injustice out.\u201d He evocatively longed for a \u201cfuneral of hate\u201d. On Where Is Our Love Song, which he first started writing aged 18 and recently returned to, he sings of \u201cdesperately needed words of hope \u2026 Not the kind of hope that leaves some of us behind / But the kind of hope that lifts up all humankind.\u201d He said it stemmed from \u201call the confusion, all the hate, the east versus west, left versus right: a heartbreak \u2026 a lot of confusion.\u201d All the proceeds from the track will go to the charity Feeding America to provide aid during the coronavirus pandemic, with Wonder saying: \u201cWe are in a place we\u2019ve never been in before, so if I can do anything to use the gift of song to help to feed people, to show my love \u2026 it is my joy.\u201d He advised people to wear masks to protect themselves from the virus. He added that he plans to take up residence in Ghana, though he didn\u2019t elaborate further. He also announced the creation of a new label, So What the Fuss Music, distributed and marketed by the Universal subsidiary Republic, ending his longstanding relationship with Motown Records. Wonder, 70, had a kidney transplant in December 2019, but said today: \u201cI feel great, my voice feels great. I tell my daughter Aisha, \u2018I\u2019m going to be five years younger than you\u2019 ... I feel about 40 right now.\u201d His previous single was 2016\u2019s Faith, featuring Ariana Grande, while his previous album was A Time to Love in 2005. In the last decade he has contributed to tracks by artists as varied as Travis Scott, Celine Dion, Drake and Barbra Streisand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
