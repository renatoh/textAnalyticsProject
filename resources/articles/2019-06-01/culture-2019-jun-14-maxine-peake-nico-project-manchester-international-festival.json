The late German singer, model and actor had a complicated relationship with the truth, even when it pertained to the details of her own life \u2013 she was most likely born in Cologne in 1938, but there\u2019s a chance it could have been Budapest in 1943. Since her death in 1988 (after suffering a heart attack while cycling on holiday in Ibiza), Nico has been immortalised as a troubled muse. To date, her work has mainly been examined in relation to the men by whom she was surrounded \u2013 the Velvet Underground, Andy Warhol and Alain Delon. But a new immersive performance piece debuting at the Manchester International Festival, titled The Nico Project and co-created by the actor Maxine Peake and the director Sarah Frankcom, will attempt to explore the enigmatic femme fatale on her own terms. \u201cI was just fascinated with Nico as an artist and how she portrayed herself,\u201d Peake said in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cHow in her later years there was this juxtaposition between her being a very beautiful model and then resenting that beauty.\u201d Peake added: \u201cEverything is so surprising with Nico, she\u2019s so complex and contradictory.\u201d Nico, born Christa P\u00e4ffgen, is widely known for modelling for Chanel, appearing in Federico Fellini\u2019s La Dolce Vita and singing on the Velvet Underground\u2019s debut album. Less well known, however, is her work as a solo musician. In 1967 she released her debut solo album, Chelsea Girl. Some of the songs on the record were co-written by the Velvet Underground\u2019s Lou Reed, John Cale and Sterling Morrison, but Nico was growing tired of relinquishing artistic direction to men. In Dave Thompson\u2019s book Hearts of Darkness, he writes that Nico said of the record: \u201cThe first time I heard the album, I cried. They had destroyed it.\u201d When Peake and Frankcom talked about making a performance piece about Nico, the pair initially considered a biopic. \u201cWe decided instead it should be an exploration of her as an artist, but also what it means to be a woman and an artist,\u201d Peake said. The Nico Project, which is described as a theatrical immersion into her sound, centres on the follow-up to Chelsea Girl \u2013 The Marble Index, which Nico wrote herself. Peake said she felt like it was the album Nico \u201cwas most connected to\u201d. Released in 1968 to poor sales and ultimately relative obscurity, it\u2019s a haunting and difficult avant-garde album, with abrasive vocals and the jarring sounds of a harmonium. What little critical attention it did get over the years, however, hailed it as a masterpiece. In his 1978 essay Your Shadow Is Scared of You: An Attempt Not to Be Frightened by Nico, celebrated rock critic Lester Bangs wrote: \u201cThe Marble Index is the greatest piece of \u2018avant-garde classical\u2019, \u2018serious\u2019 music of the last half of the 20th century so far.\u201d Peake, herself a longtime fan of The Marble Index, said: \u201cWe chose to reimagine The Marble Index because that\u2019s the album that felt like she finally got her artistic control on.\u201d Nico had spent the best part of the 1980s living in Manchester \u2013 yet another unexpected footnote in the story of her life, and a period Peake was interested in. \u201cManchester, during that period of the late 70s, early 80s, had a great music scene, but it got hijacked by the men,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of the women have either been overlooked, forgotten or just couldn\u2019t get the oxygen to get through.\u201d The team behind The Nico Project is all-female, which Peake said wasn\u2019t intentional, but nonetheless felt right. \u201cI could only seem to find male stories about Nico,\u201d she said. \u201cI found it very difficult to get a female perspective on it.\u201d Nico\u2019s own identity as a woman was nuanced. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a woman\u2019s woman,\u201d Peake said. \u201cShe said a few times that she wished she was a man, which came from the fact that as an artist she would have been more recognised.\u201d To say Nico was a controversial artist is an understatement. Island Records dropped her after she made racist remarks. She would also perform the German national anthem Das Lied der Deutschen at concerts and include the verses that had been banned after 1945 for their Nazi associations. Peake said that she did not want to shy away from reimagining Nico. \u201cWe\u2019re not agreeing with her,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re exploring her and where some of these views came from that she\u2019s alleged to have had.\u201d At the same time, Nico\u2019s turbulent lifestyle bore the scars of addiction and loss. She lived through the second world war; her soldier father died, but it\u2019s not certain how \u2013 either in a concentration camp or of shellshock. \u201cShe was dealing with a lot of trauma, which is maybe why the truth seems slippery with her,\u201d Peake said. In researching Nico, Peake said she found a complicated and contradictory artist, one whose posthumous narrative has predominantly been constructed by men. \u201cWhat was the truth with Nico? I don\u2019t know if even she knew what her own truth was.\u201d \u2022 The Nico Project is at The Stoller Hall, Hunts Bank, Manchester M3 1DA, 10-13 July and 16-21 July \u2022 The Guardian is a media partner of Manchester international festival."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
