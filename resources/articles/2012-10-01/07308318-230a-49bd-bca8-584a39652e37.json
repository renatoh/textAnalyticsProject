Cook and carve pumpkins at Rosemoor, Great Torrington; haggle for bulbs at Hyde Hall, Rettendon; sample elusive apple varieties and quiz gardening expert Pippa Greenwood at Wisley, Woking; or fathom your fungi at a mushroom session and hear ethnobotanist James Wong \u2013 who urges British people to break free from their spuds and sprouts \"time-warp\" and experiment with saffron and sweet potatoes \u2013 at Harlow Carr, Harrogate. RHS Gardens: Rosemoor, Hyde Hall, Wisley, Harlow Carr, Sat &amp; Sun Colette Bernhardt National Honey Show, Weybridge Honey was once only beloved of slightly dim bears, Sugar Puff-scoffing monsters and the Greeks, but urban beekeeping and farmers' markets have made the sticky stuff a much-loved, much-discussed substance. This annual festival of honey has just about everything that the experienced or potential honey-maker could wish for, with workshops and lectures covering all bases, from honey bees of ancient Egypt to decoding waggle dances. Just to prove that honey is about more than something to put on your toast, there are also lessons in mead brewing, candle making, and creating luxury honey-based toiletries, as well as traders selling their own honeys and honey products. St George's College, Surrey, Thu to 28 Oct Iain Aitch GameCity7, Nottingham \"Play\" is the key word throughout this week-long celebration of videogames, both in the fun sense and the notion of the power of play to teach and inspire. Talks, game premieres and the STEAM programme of games developers' workshops are the bread-and-butter basics. The anarchic topping of inspired play is the Venus Patrol Training Facility by Brandon Boyer, an irreverent arena that includes a sumo wrestling simulation, a god mod that allows you to hop around a magical world as frog, and a lazy person's football game, where you simply tap the screen to make your players move and play. Slob-friendly, imaginative fun. Various venues, to 27 Oct Katrina Dixon Out &amp; about Battle Of Ideas, London, Sat &amp; Sun More than 80 sessions where you can debate everything from what Game Of Thrones says about the so-called Dark Ages to the ecological unsoundness of fracking gas and radical pop music. Barbican Centre, EC2 North-West Food Lovers Festival, Knutsford, Sat &amp; Sun Plenty of stomach-stuffing opportunities here, with food and drink from more than 120 local producers, plus masterclasses. Tatton Park Scottish International Storytelling Festival, Edinburgh, Sat to 28 Oct Folktales from Germany, Poland, Italy, France, Norway, Russia and the UK, inspired by the 200th anniversary of the Grimms' fairytales. Various venues The Great British Walk, Across the UK, Sat to 4 Nov With autumn's colours in full glow, now's the time to sample one of the National Trust's 1,300-plus trails and events, some surprisingly urban.
