After the encouraging sight of David Beckham performing tricks for the crowd in Kobe two days ago the England captain yesterday continued his rehabilitation and was striking the ball firmly with his left foot. He will be back in the gym tomorrow but his progress means that Sven-Goran Eriksson may get his wish of seeing him in a full training session on Thursday or Friday. There is speculation that Eriksson will not require another x-ray of the foot that sustained a fractured metatarsal against Deportivo La Coruna in April, so confident is he of Beckham's readiness. However, it is more likely the England coach would prefer the player to have an x-ray to show him that it has fully healed and give Beckham the necessary peace of mind. Juan Sebastian Veron, Beckham's Manchester United colleague and the midfield playmaker for Argentina, England's opponents in their second game a week on Friday, is confident that Beckham will be fit for that match. \"I didn't get a chance to talk to him before leaving but I know he has high hopes [for the June 7 group F match in Sapporo] after the disappointment of being sent off against us in the 1998 match in France,\" said Veron. \"He sees it as a chance for revenge. And apart from that, from our point of view we want England to have their best 11 available.\" Another United player, Nicky Butt, is expected to take part in a full training session tomorrow following his knee injury and there was further good news regarding the goalkeeper David Seaman. He was forced to miss the the 2-2 draw against Cameroon last Sunday because of a groin injury. The Arsenal player trained yesterday, however, and showed no ill effects."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
