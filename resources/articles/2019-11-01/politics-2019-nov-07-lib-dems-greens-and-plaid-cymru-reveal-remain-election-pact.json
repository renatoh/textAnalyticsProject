The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green party said they would give voters one \u201cremain choice\u201d across England and Wales, with candidates standing aside in seats in Brighton, Exeter and Bristol, parts of London and the south-west, and 11 of Wales\u2019s 40 constituencies. The project, called Unite to Remain and led by the former MP Heidi Allen, was launched more widely on Thursday after its initial success in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection earlier this year. The Greens and Plaid Cymru stood aside for the Lib Dem candidate in that seat, ousting the sitting Conservative, Chris Davies, in the process. Allen, who is leaving politics at the election after spells with the Tories, Change UK and the Lib Dems, said: \u201cThis is a Brexit election, and staying in the European Union is possible, and this is the deciding moment. \u201cWe are putting party politics aside in the interest of our country and [we have] cemented a cross-party arrangement whereby remain-voting parties in England and Wales are working together to back one remain candidate. \u201cWith a single remain candidate in each of these seats, we can deliver a greater number of MPs into parliament. This is our opportunity to tip the balance of power away from the two largest parties and into the progressive remain alliance.\u201d The Lib Dems will not challenge the Green party in Brighton Pavilion, which Caroline Lucas is defending. The party did the same in the 2017 general election. The Greens will also field the only \u201cremain candidate\u201d in eight other seats in England, and Vale of Glamorgan in Wales. The Lib Dems are expected to benefit most from the arrangement, given the Greens will stand aside in 40 seats in England, and Plaid and the Greens will stand aside in three seats in Wales. Among the seats in England are Tory-held Watford, Esher and Walton, and Chelsea and Fulham. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, said it was only possible to build a brighter political future \u201cif we are prepared to work alongside others\u201d. Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, said the strategy was \u201cgrownup politics\u201d. The Greens and Lib Dems will stand down in favour of Plaid in Arfon, Caerphilly, Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Llanelli, Pontypridd and Ynys M\u00f4n. Unite to Remain said it had approached Labour about being part of the process, but had been rebuffed. Asked about the pact, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: \u201cWe will never enter pacts, coalitions or deals like that. Ever.\u201d After a speech in Liverpool, McDonnell condemned the Lib Dem role in the 2010-15 coalition government with the Tories. \u201cI\u2019d just say this to those Greens and others who are getting into bed with the Lib Dems: I remember what the Lib Dems did when they were in government. I say, go and ask any disabled person in this country who went through the brutality of the work capability assessment,\u201d he said. Unite to Remain\u2019s directors include the Labour peer and former cabinet minister Jim Knight and the remain-supporting QC Jessica Simor.
