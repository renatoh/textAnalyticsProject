Everton have slipped to sixth in the Premier League, five points adrift of Liverpool in fourth, after their last four matches produced one win and consecutive away defeats at Anfield and White Hart Lane. The absence of a proven striker cost Mart\u00ednez's team at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday and the manager will have the same problem against Crystal Palace on Wednesday, with new signing Lacina Traor\u00e9 deemed unfit to start. But while Everton have faltered as their Merseyside rivals have kicked on, Mart\u00ednez denies fourth place is now Liverpool's to lose. \"I don't see it that way,\" said the Everton manager. \"We have 39 points to fight for. Liverpool, I think they are in the peak of their season. They have been terrific at home, the way they use impetus and start games. In the first 20 minutes they have been a real threat, in dead-ball situations and in counter-attacking, and now it's about maintaining that until the end of the season. \"They have got a little bit of an advantage because of the points tally they have, but it's small margins from now until the end of the season. \"For example, some teams have seven away fixtures, others have seven at home. Playing against a team that is safe is not the same as a team that is fighting to be safe. \"There are many different aspects that are going to play a big part so I see it that the race is still wide open.\" Mart\u00ednez also contests the theory that Chelsea, Arsenal and City will take the top three places and have left only the fourth Champions League position available. He added: \"I would not say that's a given. You've got clubs who are going to have incredible moments in the Champions League, not physically, but emotionally. Sometimes you get a massive blow, you lose a player or a game and all of a sudden your season crumbles for two or three weeks. That can have a massive effect. \"Two weeks ago Manchester City were the champions. Now everyone is questioning them. It is about extremes, it is one way or the other. I don't see it that way. Man City have to play all the top sides away from home. They have a two-legged tie with Barcelona in the Champions League. You could say the same about Arsenal. What is encouraging for me is the way we are becoming a dominant team wherever we go and, with getting our injured players back, I think we are going to finish the season really strong. This league is wide, wide open.\" Everton will again be without Romelu Lukaku against Palace \u2013 the on-loan striker is not expected to return from an ankle injury until 1 March \u2013 and Champions League football appears imperative to keeping the Belgium international at Goodison Park. In an interview with Het Laatste Nieuws on Tuesday, Lukaku said: \"It is high time that I play in the Champions League. It is the next step I need in my development. Full stop. I must now show I'm ready for it. I still have two years on my contract and I know Chelsea follow my development. In the end it depends on what the manager thinks about me.\" Mart\u00ednez, meanwhile, has revealed Ross Barkley is still feeling the effects of a fractured toe suffered in the FA Cup win over Queens Park Rangers almost six weeks ago. \"When he pushes from the ground there is a sharp pain and that stops him thinking on the ball and about his foot instead,\" said the Everton manager. \"He is not 100% in terms of match fitness and sharpness on the ball.\" Mart\u00ednez expects the midfielder to have fully recovered in time for England's friendly against Denmark on 5 March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
