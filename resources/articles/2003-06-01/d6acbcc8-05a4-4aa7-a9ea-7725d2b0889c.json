The Croatian, who beat Lleyton Hewitt on Monday, can expect to improve significantly on the \u00a314,000 prize money he is guaranteed even if he is ejected from the competition today by the Australian Paul Baccanello. He spent yesterday afternoon on the court with a reporter from a mid-market tabloid - although sources at the newspaper insisted no money had changed hands. An International Tennis Federation employee who speaks Serbo-Croat is at present negotiating sponsorship opportunities for the world No203, who previously represented himself but will be a centre of attention for as long as he stays in the tournament. Karlovic played his first-round match wearing a patch advertising Geico, a US insurance company, but that was simply a one-off deal struck as soon as he realised he would be up against Hewitt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
