Detectives were able to trace Bryan Keen, 50, using DNA samples and he was arrested at his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire. Manchester crown court heard how he filmed himself raping the woman, then a prostitute working in Whalley Range, Manchester, who was gagged, blindfolded and threatened. At the time, police were unable to produce a full DNA profile but forensic techniques have since become more sophisticated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
