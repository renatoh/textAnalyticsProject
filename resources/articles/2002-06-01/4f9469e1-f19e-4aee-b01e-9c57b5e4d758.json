Two young Sussex wicketkeepers savaged them for the highest ever sixth-wicket stand for a visiting county at Headingley yesterday, but that was nothing compared with the personal torment of Gavin Hamilton. The 28-year-old Scot, winner of one England cap, conceded 16 extras in a 12-ball over midway through the morning session, bowling a no-ball and five very wide wides. Something similarly traumatic happened to him in a pre-season game, but he had shown signs of rehabilitation in the second team and was recalled in place of England off-spinner Richard Dawson. The rest of Yorkshire's bowling provoked murmurs of a different kind, although at least Steve Kirby was relatively restrained after becoming the first player to pick up three points under the championship's new disciplinary code last week at Leicester. Kirby and Chris Silverwood each took two wickets to reduce Sussex to 121 for five before Prior joined Ambrose to transform the match. Tim Ambrose had taken 36 overs to graft to 26 but was galvanised by Matthew Prior's arrival and rushed on to an increasingly impressive maiden century from 210 balls. Prior is the latest name on the list of potential successors to Alec Stewart. He looked the part, driving beautifully off the back foot and pulling a beamer from Simon Katich over midwicket for one of two sixes in his second consecutive half-century."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
