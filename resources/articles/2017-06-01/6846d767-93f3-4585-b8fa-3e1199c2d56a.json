A vote is expected next week. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said he expects to have a \u201cdiscussion draft\u201d of legislation that would dismantle key provisions of the Affordable Care Act ready by Thursday morning. McConnell said a finalized version of the bill would be released after the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) publishes its analysis, which is expected to occur sometime next week. But it remains to be seen whether Republican leaders have enough support from their own members to fulfill a longstanding campaign promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), known as Obamacare. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make every effort to pass a bill that dramatically changes the current healthcare law,\u201d McConnell replied, when asked if he was \u201cconfident\u201d the bill would pass. Several Republican senators have raised concerns about elements of the bill, which is being assembled by a 13-person working group that includes the most conservative senators but excludes key moderate members. The trick has been crafting legislation that appeals to conservatives without alienating moderates. House Republicans wrangled with a similar dynamic when drafting their bill earlier this year. McConnell said the Senate had taken a \u201cdifferent approach\u201d from the the House version but Republicans remain deeply divided on key issues. On one side of the debate, a handful of conservative Republicans have argued that the current parameters of the healthcare overhaul do not go far enough to repeal the ACA. But some moderates have raised concerns that the bill may go too far in scaling back funding for the Medicaid health program for the poor, eliminate funding for the women\u2019s health organization Planned Parenthood and weakening protections for people with so-called \u201cpre-existing conditions\u201d. \u201cI won\u2019t vote yes until I\u2019ve satisfied myself that [the bill] continues to improve over what we currently have,\u201d Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, told reporters after the Senate GOP lunch on Tuesday. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll need information to able to make that determination.\u201d In an interview with a local ABC affiliate last week, Johnson said he was \u201cnot sure\u201d that Republicans would be able to muster 50 votes for their plan. Republicans, who hold a small, 52-seat majority in the 100-member Senate, are using a special budget process called reconciliation that allows them to bypass a Democratic filibuster. But their margin is slim: they can only afford to lose two GOP senators to earn the necessary 50 votes, with Vice-President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote. Republicans are also becoming increasingly frustrated with the secrecy surrounding the drafting of the bill. As of Tuesday, several senators admitted that they still had not seen the bill. \u201cI think, right now, nobody really has a finalized healthcare bill and I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s seen any kind of final text,\u201d Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota and a member of leadership, told reporters. In a video on Tuesday, Senator Mike Lee, a conservative from Utah who is in the healthcare working group, said even he had not yet seen a draft. \u201cIt has become increasingly apparent over the past few days that even though we thought we were going to be in charge of writing the bill within the working group, it\u2019s not being written by us,\u201d Lee said. He concluded: \u201cSo if you\u2019re frustrated by the lack of transparency in this process, I share your frustration wholeheartedly.\u201d Democrats, too, have mounted a protest against the secretive nature of the Republican healthcare bill, using procedural tactics to slow routine business in the Senate. Some senators took it a step further. On Tuesday, three Democratic senators hailed a cab from the Capitol to the CBO office, where the agency has already begun to analyze pieces of the plan. \u201cThere\u2019s only one possible reason why my friends on the other side are going along with this process, only one reason: they are ashamed of the bill they\u2019re writing,\u201d Schumer said in a floor speech on Tuesday, standing next to a sign that quoted Trump calling the Republican health care bill \u201cmean\u201d. \u201cIf they were proud of the bill, they would announce it. They would have brass bands going down Main Street America saying: \u2018Look at our bill. They can\u2019t even whisper what it\u2019s about they are so, so ashamed of it.\u201d Trump reportedly told tech leaders on Monday that the Senate plan needed \u201cmore heart\u201d. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters on Tuesday that Trump \u201cclearly\u201d wanted a healthcare bill that \u201chas heart in it\u201d. \u201cHe made it clear from the beginning that that was one of his priorities,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cAnd as the Senate works its way through this bill, as the House did, any ideas are welcome to strengthen it, to make it more affordable, more accessible, and deliver the care that it needs.\u201d McConnell on Tuesday parried accusations that the process was carried out in secret. \u201cI think this will be as about as transparent as it can be,\u201d he said. Asked if the public would have time to review the bill between Thursday and a vote next week, McConnell replied: \u201cOh, they\u2019ll have plenty of time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
