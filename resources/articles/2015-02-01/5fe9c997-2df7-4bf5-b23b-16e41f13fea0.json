There are Latvians, Somalis, Lithuanians, Jamaicans, Hungarians, Iraqis, Poles, Russians \u2013 around 30 nationalities in all. Even a few Brits. In the last census, 17% of the area\u2019s residents described themselves as white British. There also seem to be plenty of non-white British people, second- and third-generation immigrants, such as Rafique, who runs a shop, and whose parents came from Pakistan in the 1950s. To be honest, it\u2019s hard to tell who lives on Derby Road \u2013 or Immigration Street, as Channel 4 is calling it \u2013 because most of them have fuzzed-out heads on television. They\u2019re not keen to be there \u2013 on the telly, that is, not on Derby Road. Or Pixelation Street, as I\u2019m calling it. There aren\u2019t many consent forms being signed around here. That\u2019s mainly because of Benefits Street and the hoo-ha that followed. This is made by the same company. One of the issues seems to be the title. (Is \u201cimmigration\u201d really an offensive word, though? If so, is a lot of airport signage upsetting for some people?) A bigger problem for me is that they\u2019re all being lumped together \u2013 refugees, recent arrivals from an expanded Europe and the descendants of people who came here over half a century ago. Also, you probably can\u2019t get to the heart of a massive story such as this on one street, but I can see that television requires this kind of device. No one can argue that the subject isn\u2019t justifiable \u2013 it\u2019s the main story in Britain in the run up to this election. A valid exercise, then, so long as it\u2019s done responsibly and sensitively \u2013 which, to be fair to Love Productions, it is. That seems to be the intention, anyway; the problem is that hardly anyone will play. And the people who do, who will be named and remain unfuzzed, are \u2013 with the exception of Jamaican Leroy \u2013 British. So it doesn\u2019t work then, certainly not as the six-part series about immigration it was supposed to be. But, halfway through, Immigration Street turns into something else. What started as an unwillingness to take part turns into an attempt, by some, to stop the whole thing happening. The crew, plus the few participants, are intimidated, egged, threatened with worse. Someone is beaten up. It has changed from a film about immigration into a film about an attempt to make a film about immigration; a self-fuelling media story, with newspaper photographers taking pictures of the film crew, who turn their own lenses back at the snappers across the road. The filmers, now protected by security men, resort to interviewing themselves \u2013 it\u2019s fair enough, I suppose, they\u2019ve become the story. It\u2019s like a snowball of hatred and mistrust and inward-looking irony rolling down Derby Road, gathering momentum, while from the sides a pixelated mob hurls eggs and abuse, and threatens to fire bullets. A so-called meeting between the community and the production company is a farce. The filmers are shouted down without being listened to; the politicians do what politicians do \u2013 say what they think most people in the room want them to say. The mob rules, Love Productions is run out of town and six episodes becomes one. A famous victory for the people over the media twats from London? No. If it\u2019s a victory, it\u2019s a hollow one. There are no real winners. Not Derby Road, certainly. And there\u2019s further irony there, that what could have been a series that went beyond the headlines and the rhetoric and showed a multi- ethnic community in a sympathetic light ended up turning so ugly. It probably still says something about Britain today, but I\u2019m not entirely sure what. On a less depressing note, Critical (Sky 1), Jed Mercurio\u2019s new medical drama, is brilliant. We\u2019re in the trauma unit of the futuristic City General hospital, where a badly mashed-up man is helicoptered in from a traffic accident/stabbing. And that\u2019s it, we\u2019re with the team \u2013 and literally inside the patient \u2013 as they try to stop him dying. In spite of the sci-fi set, Critical feels very real. It\u2019s in real time, which certainly adds to the urgency. And the depiction of surgery is graphic (I couldn\u2019t always look). But it\u2019s also in the dynamics within the team, the power struggles and motivations. If Casualty and Holby are medical drama administered by drip, this is television defibrillation \u2013 charging, three, two, one, BOOM! \u2013 with a triple shot of adrenaline in the arm at the same time, while Jed pumps away at your chest. At the end, I felt I\u2019d really been put through something, absolutely shattered, but also very much alive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
