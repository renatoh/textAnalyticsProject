Scheduled to open in March 2021, Show Town: The Museum of Fun and Entertainment will be situated on the promenade, near Blackpool Tower. It is the culmination of years of lobbying and fundraising, particularly from council leader Simon Blackburn, who in 2012 complained that the town had become a \u201crefuge for the dispossessed\u201d. He made it his mission to change the resort, saying then: \u201cI can\u2019t stand by and let Blackpool be seen as ... a hapless victim of society\u2019s ills.\u201d But Blackburn bristles at the suggestion he is trying to attract a wealthier demographic, or turn Blackpool middle class. \u201cBlackpool has always been somewhere you can have a holiday on a small budget but everything we have been doing over the past eight years since I became leader is about broadening that offer, building new hotels and improving our cultural offer,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is a very dangerous and class-bound assumption that we are building hotel rooms and cultural attractions for a different kind of person. I\u2019m working class in my bones and I don\u2019t like the idea that it\u2019s only middle class people who want to go to a museum or stay in a nice hotel.\u201d He said the museum was primarily aimed at local people, who will get free entry. Residents have long tired of the town featuring bottom of all the tables, whether for its early death rate (twice that of the most affluent areas) or for having the worst statistics for smoking or divorce. \u201cWe wanted to give local people a real sense of their history and their place in the town,\u201d said Blackburn. \u201cOne of my starting points for this conversation was that two of my children were born in Blackpool and have been brought up here all their lives and I didn\u2019t get a sense that they had a strong sense of what it meant to be a Blackpudlian. And if you look at the membership of the Blackpool Civic Trust, they are all of a certain age, and I wondered where the next generation of people with civic pride and a real sense of the history and heritage of the town was coming from.\u201d Sited in the redeveloped Sands building, Show Town is expected to attract 296,000 visits annually, deliver 39 full-time jobs and provide \u00a313.16m of regional economic benefit. It will cost a total of \u00a312.6m, a million of which will come from Blackpool council \u2013 which according to Blackburn, earns more than that each year in dividends from its own profit-making local transport service. As well as \u00a34m from the Lottery Heritage Fund, the museum has also received \u00a34m from the Northern Cultural Regeneration Fund and \u00a31.5m from a government growth fund. The new museum will house over 100,000 items of the town\u2019s collections, featuring Britain\u2019s first permanent displays of circus, music, variety and ballroom dance. Items include those belonging to some of the biggest names in British entertainment, such as Stan Laurel\u2019s hat and suits belonging to Morecambe and Wise, who considered Blackpool their spiritual home. The museum will work in partnership with the V&amp;A, which back in 2008 first started talking about lending some of its vast store of unexhibited items in a Blackpool outpost. Also on show will be some of the 40,000-strong Tower and Winter Gardens archive and key pieces from the Illuminations Collection, which tells the story of the annual extravaganza of lights. A likely highlight will be a collection of \u201csaucy\u201d postcards stamped \u201capproved\u201d or \u201cdisapproved\u201d by the Blackpool Postcard Censorship Board, and an exhibit explaining how the Rolling Stones came to be banned from the Empress Ballroom. It is part of a huge regeneration project, which will soon see the opening of the first five-star hotel in the resort since the 1960s and a state-of-the-art conference centre next to the historic Winter Gardens. In December last year plans were revealed for a \u00a3300m redevelopment of a 17-acre site which will include the UK\u2019s first \u201cflying theatre\u201d, as well as restaurants and hotels. Other projects given Lottery Heritage funding in the latest round include: Bradford Live \u2013 just under \u00a31m to help transform Bradford\u2019s Odeon into a 4,000 capacity entertainment venue. Stockton Town Centre Northern Gateway \u2013 just over \u00a31.8m to \u201ccomplete the jigsaw\u201d of heritage-led regeneration and redevelopment on the High Street. The Whitaker Experience \u2013 just over \u00a31.7m to re-imagine a key museum for Rossendale, east Lancashire Dippy on Tour - \u00a3159,000 to see the North West play host to the Natural History Museum\u2019s most famous dinosaur."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
