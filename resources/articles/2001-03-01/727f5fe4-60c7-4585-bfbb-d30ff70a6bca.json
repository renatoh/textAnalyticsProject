The loo stops, the incessant \"Are we nearly there yet?\", the car-sickness and the boredom make even the most resilient parents gulp at the thought of the annual family holiday. It's not so much the being there that freezes courage, more the actual getting there - and back, of course. Whichever way you choose to travel - air, rail, ferry or car - it won't suit somebody. Bearing this in mind, and starting with the worst possible scenario as a baseline, the most dire thing that can happen is that your expectations will be met. The best picture is that travelling becomes an exciting adventure, and a bit of advance preparation to quell the dullest moments can ensure travelling tranquility. The more involvement the kids have in the planning stages of the trip, the more interested they are likely to be. Follow a few simple guidelines, do a spot of advance shopping, cross your fingers and hope for the best. Baby on board \u0095 If there is one thing a baby loathes, it is take-off and landing in an aircraft. Pressure on their ear-drums causes much squeaking. If you breast feed, make sure your little one is well latched on, if you don't, ensure a bottle is well and truly at the ready. The sucking action will help distract him or her, and soothe the pressure. \u0095 Try to travel during your baby's natural sleep time. \u0095 Keep it short. It is unrealistic to expect a dream passage to Australia with a wriggly baby on your lap. \u0095 Take warm clothing for flights. Aeroplanes have Arctic air conditioning. Tricky toddlers \u0095 If you are travelling by car, plan plenty of breaks. \u0095 Pack them their own little picnic box with a few favourite treats to munch. \u0095 Don't take their beloved cuddly. There is no other sure-fire way to ruin your holiday than losing their most precious companion. (Sensible parents have a \"double\" for just such events). \u0095 If all else fails, sing. Toddlers adore a good sing-song. Story and music tapes might help. School age \u0095 Don't ever let yourself be heard moaning about how ghastly the journey will be. If you stay upbeat and positive, it may well not occur to the children that travelling can be anything other than interesting. \u0095 Pack a couple of new games (see below) or toys. \u0095 If you are flying or travelling by Eurostar, forget packing crayons and drawing books. Most airlines have a free pack to give out to kids, and Eurostar's pack comes in a handy backpack. \u0095 Ring your airline ahead and order children's meals. Airline food is usually grim, but there isn't much they can do to chicken nuggets that hasn't already been done by the school dinner lady. So, you got there... \u0095 If in sunny climes, buy a small inflatable boat (with safety rope) for the beach. It is the most versatile holiday accessory. Use to bed down tired toddlers under the shade of an umbrella; fill with sand for a safe and contained baby sand pit; fill with water for a paddling pool; or have a gentle bob on the waves at the water's edge. \u0095 When your kids are happy playing on the beach, don't drag them miles to see ancient monuments and ruins. They'll whinge and you'll get cross. \u0095 Make it a priority on arrival to have the phone numbers and addresses of the nearest dentist, doctor, hospital and chemist. Looking for emergency information in a panic is hopeless. \u0095 Don't hassle your kids. If they want to eat pizza and chips for a fortnight, then let them. You have 50 more weeks to be right about their diet. Holidays are about fun - don't rain on the party by being a pooper. Anti Nausea Band, \u00a37.49.
