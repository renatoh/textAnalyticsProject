The demand comes in the wake of the government's energy review, which laid the groundwork for more nuclear stations to replace existing plants that are being phased out due to old age. But there was also disappointing news for supporters of atomic power with the Finnish energy firm TVO saying its new Olkiluoto 3 plant was now one year behind schedule and the builder - Areva of France - reporting a \"sharp fall\" in first-half operating results. The UK petition was organised by trade unions representing Sellafield workers and Peter Kane, a spokesman for the GMB union at the facility, told the West Cumbrian Times and Star newspaper that Mr Blair had been \"encouraging\". Mr Kane said Sellafield had several advantages over other potential sites: \"The local community would accept it, there's room to build it and the nuclear expertise is here already.\" Local politicians such as the MP for Workington, Tony Cunningham, also told the paper that Sellafield, where the first plant, Calderhall, was constructed, was an ideal site for a new-generation power station. \"There's been a nuclear power station at Sellafield for the last 50 years and I see no reason why there should not be one in future,\" he said. But the move is likely to face opposition from environmentalists and the Irish government, which has campaigned for Sellafield to be closed down. British Nuclear Group, which operates Sellafield, is currently waiting to hear what level of fine it will receive for an accident at the Thorp fuel reprocessing facility there. Much of Sellafield, including Calderhall, is being decommissioned by BNG, which is itself about to be privatised. Areva warned that operating profits for the first six months of the year would be lower than the same period of 2005 and full-year operating cash flow would be \"highly negative\". But the group - mainly French state-owned and a likely candidate to build any new stations in Britain - said it would be able to maintain its overall annual profit targets because of successes in other parts of the business. Much is riding on the Finnish plant because it is the first one to be built in Europe for many years. It was expected to be operating in 2009 under the original timetable but TVO is now aiming for the second quarter of 2010."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
