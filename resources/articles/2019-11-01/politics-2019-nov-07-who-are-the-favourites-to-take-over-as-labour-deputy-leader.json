A new deputy will not be chosen until after the election but already some candidates are starting to emerge. Dawn Butler The MP for Brent South is one of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s closest allies and is the shadow women and equalities minister. The only person to yet declare, she is thought to have the backing of some of the Labour leader\u2019s inner circle. Rebecca Long-Bailey The shadow business secretary, former Unite official and a John McDonnell protege, is close friends with Angela Rayner and is trusted by Corbyn\u2019s inner circle with complicated briefs. She is expected to front Labour\u2019s Green New Deal. Jess Phillips Some senior Labour figures are urging the MP for Birmingham Yardley to stand. Phillips, who is a passionate campaigner for women\u2019s rights, would be opposed by many of those close to Corbyn. Angela Rayner The shadow education secretary has been MP for Ashton-under-Lyne since 2015. A one-time teenage mother, her backstory terrifies Conservative opponents and appeals to Labour members."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
