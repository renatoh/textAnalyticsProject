Hillary Clinton spent Tuesday morning in Washington being chastised by an unexpectedly stern director of the FBI, but a few hours later she was flying free \u2013 cleared at least of the threat of criminal charges and heading to her first campaign rally alongside the commander-in-chief, with only political storms on the horizon. Their arrival in North Carolina was not without its awkward moments. Add together the standard presidential motorcade and the already long convoy of a presidential candidate, and you reach a cumbersome 28-vehicle snake that nearly tied itself in a knot on the way out of the airport. But by the time Obama and Clinton\u2019s shared limousine, nicknamed \u201cthe beast\u201d, reached the Charlotte Convention Center, the former secretary of state was basking in the kind of unabashed praise that would have been impossible for Obama to deliver while a possible indictment was still hanging over her. \u201cMy faith in Hillary Clinton has always been rewarded,\u201d said the president in a speech that was part campaign endorsement, part character testimony. \u201cI have had a front row seat to her judgment,\u201d he added, without a hint of irony. It was hard to tell whether the beaming Clinton was happier about the compliments or that Obama never once mentioned an email scandal that the FBI had found to be worse than almost anyone imagined. \u201cThe president is a friend in the good times and the bad times,\u201d said Clinton, in words that will have done nothing to lessen Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that the Obama administration had collectively \u201clet her off the hook\u201d. Instead, there were two elephants in the room: one of them Clinton\u2019s unspoken near miss with the Feds and the other one her Republican rival, who served as the main target of both Democrats\u2019 speeches. Trump\u2019s name produced a predictable response from the crowd of Clinton supporters, prompting the president to say: \u201cDon\u2019t boo \u2013 vote!\u201d \u201cEven the Republicans don\u2019t know what the other guy is talking about,\u201d he went on. \u201cThey really don\u2019t. You ask them and they are like: \u2018I dunno.\u2019\u201d Sounding increasingly confident, Obama began to excoriate Clinton\u2019s opponent and joke in the third person. \u201cI know the other guy talks about making American great again, but America is really great,\u201d he said. \u201cTurns out that when Obama came into office, the world didn\u2019t think we were that great.\u201d If the president\u2019s job was to vouch for the candidate\u2019s character on a day when it was most called into judgment, Clinton\u2019s was to protect his legacy from whatever Trump might unleash. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build on the president\u2019s idea to make community college free,\u201d she said, apropos of little. \u201cAs we went from political rivals to partners and friends, my esteem for him just kept growing,\u201d Clinton added, in a particularly difficult segue that moved from the duo\u2019s 2008 primary contest to shared foreign policy triumphs. \u201cHe knows a thing or two about winning elections, take it from me,\u201d she added, before a remark that sounded aimed at Bernie Sanders supporters. \u201cWe competed as hard as we could back in 2008, but when it was over, I was proud to endorse him,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some places, as you know, the person who loses an election gets exiled or executed, not asked to be secretary of state.\u201d Clinton also sought to position herself as the natural inheritor of Obama\u2019s historic achievement as the first African American president \u2013 harking all the way back to the \u201chot summer\u201d of 1776 for inspiration. \u201cNobody who looked like Barack Obama, or me, would have been included back then, but we are here today because the story of America is the story of hard fought progress,\u201d she said. Obama did his best to reciprocate. \u201cI am here today because I believe in Hillary Clinton and I want you to help elect her the next president of the United States of America,\u201d he began. \u201cThe bottom line is I know Hillary can do the job and that\u2019s why I am so proud, North Carolina, to endorse Hillary Clinton,\u201d he concluded. But as Trump prepared to address a rival rally 170 miles away in Raleigh, it was clear that the Democrats were going to have to do more than this if they really expected the email scandal to go away for good. \u201cAs FBI Director James Comey let Clinton off the hook for her \u2018extremely careless\u2019 actions, the fix was final,\u201d blasted Trump in a statement. \u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s anointed successor has had an indictment removed from her path, and will now be able to glide to the rigged Democrat nomination. As we move toward November, the question now becomes, \u2018what is Hillary hiding?\u2019\u201d When the dust from the FBI investigation settles, the former secretary of state is likely to have to give a fuller account of her actions, now that the world knows just how agents assessed them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
