Valencia and Deportivo had already departed and a Spanish crisis loomed. Liverpool were discovered, their adoption rapid. Rafael Ben\u00edtez has provided a surrogate side. Clutching at straws, perhaps, but there is something more than bald opportunism or wishful thinking at work. If Madrid fans took small comfort from their European adventure lasting 24 hours longer than Bar\u00e7a's, there has been genuine interest and even pride in the progress of Liverpool. Tonight's final will be broadcast by the state channel Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola and Canal Plus. And it will be watched - not least by the Real Madrid squad. \"Liverpool are definitely the most supported team here,\" their striker Michael Owen said, while Liverpool's own Luis Garc\u00eda added: \"In Spain now everyone supports Liverpool. We are all getting lots of calls wishing us luck from back home.\" But it is not just the players. Liverpool's semi-final, first leg against Chelsea boasted an audience of 3,822,000, a 25.4% share - more than any televised game not involving Real Madrid or Barcelona. Manchester United's game against Milan managed just 1.8m at its peak, short of 11%. Meanwhile, on the subscription channel Canal Plus, Liverpool versus Chelsea got 479,000, a figure one of the channel's commentators described as \"fantastic, amazing\". The reason is the Spanish connection, with the familiarity and pride it brings. At Xabi Alonso's childhood club Antiguoko, 200 kids will watch tonight's game on giant screens wearing Liverpool kits, and the flights from Madrid to Istanbul are full. Irish pubs in Madrid, sought out by Spaniards wanting an English atmosphere, were packed for the semi-final second leg - and to a man supported Liverpool not Chelsea. In the following day's newspapers double-page spreads were given over to match reports from Anfield. Interest will be greater still today. Everyone can identify with Liverpool, the club with whom Michael Robinson, Spanish television's most famous face, is most associated, from where the universally popular Steve McManaman came, where Madrid target Steven Gerrard plays. The side that handily also avenged the defeats of Madrid and Bar\u00e7a by beating the antip\u00e1tico Juventus and Chelsea - the former derided as boring and cynical, the latter led by that ingrate big-mouth Jose Mourinho. Bar\u00e7a and Atl\u00e9tico fans have Luis Garc\u00eda, Madrid supporters have Morientes and there is something about Alonso and Ben\u00edtez that has made them national property, not just representatives of Real Sociedad and Valencia. Not one of them has made themselves unpopular in Spain - with any fans. Alonso, his demeanour as impeccable as his passing, is universally liked, the brightest of hopes for the national team. Ben\u00edtez has become more popular since his departure: a beacon for Spaniards and no longer a threat to the Bar\u00e7a-Madrid duopoly. Many admitted too late just how good a coach he is, something that Valencia's collapse has demonstrated; now, rival ries removed, they can glory in his success, not snipe at it. And yet, while the Spanish connection propels interest, there is more than that at work. Sure, both of the major sports dailies, Marca and AS, ran Spanish-specific front-page headlines when Liverpool made it to the final - \"Ben\u00edtez sinks Mourinho\" in Marca; \"Ben\u00edtez gets Liverpool to the final\" in AS. Sure, many Spanish newspapers and magazines have run interviews with Ben\u00edtez (denied to the British press) and the focus has been as angled as Beck ham and Owen-centric English coverage of Real Madrid. But those without Spanish connections have been interviewed, too. In Spain there is genuine interest in foreign football and in Liverpool, with their European Cup record, most of all. Spaniards actually know who Kenny Dalglish and Graeme Souness are. They are fascinated too by the bootroom legend and Bill Shankly. Liverpool's current Spanish presence has provided the excuse, quite literally, for a new journey of discovery. And the discovery has been that Liverpool is a special club; that Anfield, held against the rather cold atmospheres of Camp Nou and the Bernab\u00e9u, is a different world. Robinson proclaimed that playing for Liverpool is \"the nearest thing to playing for a cause\", while You'll Never Walk Alone is getting regular outings on Spanish radio. Well, they can hardly play Spanish anthems. Tonight, Liverpool seek to salvage national pride - Spanish national pride. And the country is right behind them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
