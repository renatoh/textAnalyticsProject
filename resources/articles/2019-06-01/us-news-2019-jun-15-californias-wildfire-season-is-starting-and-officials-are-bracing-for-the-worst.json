Now California\u2019s fire season is starting to heat up again \u2013 and officials are bracing for the worst. As California grappled with a record-breaking heatwave last week, the state saw 236 wildfires \u2013 one of which grew to more than 2,500 acres before it was largely contained. So far this year, California has faced 1,746 wildfires, burning through more than 15,500 acres of land. The fires have mostly been fueled by the grass and brush that came up during an especially wet winter and mild spring, said Scott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire. \u201cOf course, we\u2019re hoping it\u2019ll be better this year than in 2018. But it\u2019s at a point where we cannot be complacent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fires are starting \u2013 they\u2019re starting very easily.\u201d In anticipation of peak wildfire season in the months to come, Cal Fire, under an executive order from California Governor Gavin Newsom, released a report identifying 35 top-priority projects to thin vegetation in and around more than 200 vulnerable communities. The fire agency is now working with local communities to carry out the projects and is calling on the state\u2019s National Guard to help execute them. Meanwhile, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, which cut power to 21,000 residents in Butte and Yuba counties last week, plans to do so more often during arid, windy periods when wildfire risk is highest. The utility company, whose equipment was responsible for sparking last year\u2019s deadly Camp fire, intends to shut off power to more than 5 million customers as a preventive measure. It is difficult to predict how bad the rest of this fire season will be based on the number of fires so far, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cOur worst fire years aren\u2019t necessarily the years that we\u2019ve had the highest number of fires,\u201d he noted. \u201cAll it takes is one \u2013 one huge, destructive fire to ruin the whole year.\u201d Hotter, drier summers are increasing the chances that every year for the foreseeable future \u201cis going to be a bad fire year\u201d, Swain said. In the past, a wet winter would slow the onslaught of big blazes, he added. \u201cBut nowadays, it almost doesn\u2019t matter whether we\u2019ve had a wet or dry year in some of these regions. The summers are so warm that everything dries out.\u201d US Forest Service and Interior Department officials echoed those thoughts in a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on Thursday. \u201cA challenging year is ahead of us because the wildfires that we\u2019re now experiencing are consistently more destructive than they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d said Jeff Rupert, director of the Office of Wildland Fire at the Department of the Interior. \u201cIf we\u2019re lucky, this fire year will simply be a challenging one.\u201d Over the decades, wildfire season in California has also grown longer, beginning earlier in the spring and stretching later, said Lenya Quinn-Davidson, a fire advisor with the University of California. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for us to see this many small fires in June,\u201d she said. \u201cBut 50 years ago, so many fires this early on, plus these extreme, high temperatures in June \u2013 would have been abnormal.\u201d The number of fires this year is smaller than last year, when Cal Fire counted more than 1,900 fires, not including those on federal land, by early June. This year, the National Interagency Fire Center has predicted \u201cabove normal\u201d fire potential for much of California and the West Coast, based on averages from 1999 through 2010. In recent years, experts have described a \u201cnew reality\u201d when it comes to wildfire devastation. But Cal Fire\u2019s McLean said such phrases were already tired. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here for a few years now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need to adapt.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
