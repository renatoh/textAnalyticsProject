It has become firmly established,\" said Matthew Rubin of a report into the market for research firm Verdict. More than two-thirds of UK shoppers have now used click and collect at least once, up from 51% in 2012, with fashion the most likely products to be bought via this method. The service is helping drive online sales in the UK, where a higher proportion of goods are now bought via the internet than any other major market. Out of every \u00a37 spent, \u00a31 is now spent online \u2013 compared to \u00a31 in \u00a311 in the US. UK shoppers spend an average \u00a3662 each on online shopping, according to research by OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants for trade journal Retail Week. Clothing and footwear account for more than half the value of goods ordered using click and collect services, according to Verdict. The researchers predict a 246% in click and collect grocery sales, from a low base. All the major supermarkets are now competing to come up with ideas to attract shoppers who want to buy food online but don't want to wait home for the delivery. Tesco, Asda, Waitrose and Sainsbury's are working with Transport for London to put refrigerated lockers in London Underground car parks while Waitrose is trialling a similar service at Gatwick airport and several supermarkets now offer a drive-thru pick-up service outside their stores. In contrast, the electrical market is only set to experience a 42% rise in sales over the next five years. That's because it was one of the first sectors to introduce the idea of click and collect with the market expected to be worth \u00a31.6bn by 2019."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
