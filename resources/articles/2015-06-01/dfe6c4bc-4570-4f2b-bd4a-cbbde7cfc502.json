Judging Preliminary judging will take place at the end of August 2015 and longlisted charities will then be contacted in September to submit supplementary material (See \u2018FAQs\u2019 below for more details). Final judging will take place during October when the five winning charities will be chosen. Awards ceremony The winning charities will be announced at an event in central London in early December 2015. FAQs \u2018What do you mean by UK social welfare charities?\u2019 Any eligible registered charity that helps people in Britain and/or Northern Ireland. It can be nationwide or just at community level. It can have a strong environmental theme, or involve animals, but the key thing is that it must deliver clear benefit to people - adults or children - who are disadvantaged by poverty or disability or are marginalised in some other way. If you\u2019re not sure if you qualify, don\u2019t hesitate to ask. \u2018What are the judges looking for?\u2019 The judges use the following criteria when looking at the entries received and score them accordingly depending on the evidence demonstrated by each charity: Innovative aims and objectives Evidence of having made an impact Need for help to be sustainable and grow Overall contribution to social welfare \u2018Can I supply supplementary material?\u2019 No additional material should be sent with your entry initially. A limit of three promotional items may be sent should your application be longlisted. The Guardian and its advisers may request additional information if necessary to meet the judges\u2019 criteria. All material is generally non-returnable. If shortlisted, the following information will be requested: Confirmation of the charity\u2019s annual income (i.e. Annual report and most recent copy of financial accounts, as supplied to The Charity Commission) A supporting statement, comprising a maximum of 500 words, to cover the following questions: What you would do with the prize money? What winning would mean to you? General The panel of judges is appointed by the Guardian and all its decisions are independent of the awards administration.
