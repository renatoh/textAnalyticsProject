Liverpool recorded the biggest away win in their European history in midweek when they defeated Maribor 7-0 in the Champions League. That demolition was in stark contrast to recent Premier League performances when Klopp\u2019s team, who visit Tottenham Hotspur , have struggled to turn dominant displays into maximum points. They have scored an average of 1.6 goals per Premier League game this season compared with City\u2019s remarkable 3.6 per game. Five of City\u2019s 29 league goals came against 10-man Liverpool on 9 September, a result that Klopp admits had a lasting impact on his players. But the Liverpool manager insists the team\u2019s overall performances this season demonstrate they are \u201cstill in the race\u201d. Klopp said: \u201cI don\u2019t compare City with us but I think everyone can see we are not 500 miles away. But they fly. It was a very decisive day when we lost 5-0. Dealing with a 5-0 defeat is not the easiest thing. We didn\u2019t lose confidence but we were not that fluent afterwards and it was not like we could close our eyes and finish [thinking about it]. They did exactly the opposite. I saw the Stoke goals, you see the shot from Fernandinho and you think: \u2018If it works, it works even like this.\u2019 They are a fantastic team and we don\u2019t have to compare, but it starts so early again with us having to apologise for the season so far because one team is flying.\u201d The Liverpool manager admits City were \u201cgood in the transfer market, they probably did exactly what they had to do\u201d, but believes their outstanding form in front of goal stems from keeping their strike-force intact during the summer. He added: \u201cTheir way of football I would say is not something we are too far away from but to be as clinical as they have been so far? We weren\u2019t. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing. We are still in the race, not with City in the moment because they have I don\u2019t how many points, and I don\u2019t say already that we should only fight for a top-four place. Performance-wise we are a team that should be there but now we have to get the results. \u201cWe can make steps. From a very good season last year, we can make steps this year. Position-wise I think it should be possible but it is difficult with the few points we have given away. It is a long season. If we can bring in consistency and be more ruthless, be more clinical in situations because of confidence and all that stuff, then we can win games. I would say a lot of games. In the end we will see where it leads us but again it could be a good basis to build on for the next year. Spartak Moscow punished for racist behaviour towards Liverpool player Spartak Moscow have been hit with a partial stadium closure by Uefa for \u201cracist behaviour\u201d towards Liverpool striker Bobby Adekanye during last month\u2019s Youth League match. A section of the Russian club\u2019s fans directed monkey chants at the 18-year-old attacker in the 2-1 defeat suffered by Steven Gerrard\u2019s side at Spartak\u2019s academy on 26 September. Uefa\u2019s control, ethics and disciplinary body (CEDB) upheld Liverpool\u2019s subsequent complaint and a section of Spartak\u2019s stadium will be closed for their next home game in Europe. A Uefa statement read: \u201cThe CEDB has decided to order the partial closure of the FC Spartak Moskva Stadium during the next Uefa competition match in which FC Spartak Moskva would play as the host team. FC Spartak Moskva shall inform at least seven days prior to the match, the sector(s) to be closed, which shall at least comprehend 500 seats.\u201d Spartak have been directed to \u201cdisplay a banner with the wording \u2018EqualGame\u2019, with the Uefa logo on it\u201d in the section closed to supporters. The Russian champions have also been fined 33,000 euros for holding up a \u2018Uefa Mafia\u2019 banner, setting off fireworks and blocking stairways during their Champions League clash at home to Liverpool last month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
