As reporter Richard Scott explained, this simple gesture carried enormous symbolic significance. Young was black and \"no Negro had been served in any part of the hotel since it was opened 60 years ago\". But now, just minutes after President Lyndon Johnson signed a Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination in public accommodations, Young was eager to exercise his rights. He was refused service. Undeterred, Young tried again and the following day received a quick trim. Richard Scott was one of a cadre of journalists covering the southern civil rights movement for the Guardian and Observer during the 1950s and 1960s. Hella Pick, Jonathan Steele, Godfrey Hodgson, and Alistair Cook were among the others who regularly reported on a campaign that reverberated around the globe. Revisiting their work is to be reminded of the sheer drama of those years. There are vivid reports of mass black mobilisations in Montgomery, Birmingham, Selma, and Mississippi, and across the entire south in the sit-ins and freedom rides; sober coverage of the violence, intimidation and political chicanery that greeted black challenges to white supremacy; and clear-eyed appraisals of the federal reaction (or lack thereof) to demands for racial justice. The papers capture the heroism and brutality, the successes and disappointments, the grand ideas about equality and brotherhood, and the more prosaic economic and political calculations that together defined the movement. Scott's report captures several key themes in this coverage. First, there is his respect for Jene Young, one among thousands of extraordinary ordinary people on the frontlines of the movement. While oceans of ink - not all of it flattering - were devoted to leaders like Martin Luther King, the papers are full of characters like Young who remained largely anonymous, unless, like James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman in Mississippi, they gained posthumous attention, murdered for their efforts to destroy Jim Crow. Second, Scott's article reflects the fact that by 1964, the modern civil rights movement was already a decade old, and those years had seen few unequivocal victories for racial equality. In April 1961, Anthony Howard reported on the lack of school integration in the seven years since the Supreme Court had declared segregated schools unconstitutional. Taking a swipe at both southern white intransigence and the failure of successive federal administrations to enforce the law, Howard criticised \"the general American tendency (of which the southern segregationists have made skilful use) to regard the formal letter of the law as merely a means of appeasing moralists and reformers: somehow once the edict has been promulgated it is looked upon as rather tedious and uncompromising for the legal victors to insist that it should be enforced\". Three years later, Scott's tone was even more battle-weary. \"Missouri is not Mississippi,\" he observed, and \"it is likely to be some time yet before Jene Young and his fellow Mississippi Negroes will be able to have their hair cut in their own state in the barber's shop of their choice.\" The prospects of compliance were slim. Alabama's arch-segregationist governor George Wallace \"predictably, reaffirmed ... that he would oppose the new law by not enforcing it in his state\". His counterparts in Mississippi, Florida, Georgia and Virginia also expressed varying degrees of hostility and indifference to the new law. Scott's mention of Wallace suggests another common theme: the presence of a cast of heroes and villains, whose personal qualities and public actions dramatised the moral issues involved. Countless reports and editorials stressed the sheer savagery of hardcore segregationists, contrasting them with dignified and peaceful protesters. Even when non-violent discipline broke down, there was general support for the black cause. Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark, epitomised the brutality of segregation. Replete with General Patton-style sunglasses, helmet and swagger stick, Clark routinely arrested demonstrators with the help of an electric cattle prod. He once broke his finger on the Rev CT Vivian's jaw in an attempt to discourage the preacher from registering black voters. Richard Scott could barely conceal his delight when \"the worm turned\" and a black woman punched Clark in the eye. \"Not that he took it as quietly as the Negroes had done, whom he had beaten with his club or prodded with his cattle stick. Mr Clark fought back.\" Scott pointedly noted that the burly sheriff needed the help of two deputies to subdue the woman before she was carted off to prison. If Wallace, Clark, Birmingham's notorious police chief Theophilus Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, and the Ku Klux Klan personified the evils of Jim Crow, Martin Luther King personified the righteousness of the black cause. In October 1961 an Observer profile described how \"a new spirit is abroad among Southern Negroes, and the man who embodies it is a clergyman of thirty-two, the Reverend Martin Luther King\". From his emergence during the Montgomery bus boycott until his assassination, every campaign, arrest, publication, award and controversy associated with King was dutifully covered. There was special excitement whenever King came to Britain. Indeed, it is striking how much the coverage of the American civil rights movement was yoked, implicitly or explicitly, to the story of British race relations. In 1964, Conservative Peter Griffith unseated Labour MP Patrick Gordon Walker in a Smethwick byelection conducted against a backdrop of the slogan, \"If you want a nigger for a neighbour vote Labour.\" As Jean Stead wrote, \"This was the place where Britain first learned that it had the soul of Alabama.\" There are many such examples of America being held up as a diagnostic mirror in which to examine Britain's own racial concerns. It was certainly no coincidence that Alistair Cooke's report on King's funeral shared the Guardian front page with news of a proposed race relations bill designed to protect British minorities from the sort of discrimination that had drawn such widespread disapproval when reported in the American south. \u00b7 Prof Brian Ward holds the chair of American studies at the University of Manchester"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
