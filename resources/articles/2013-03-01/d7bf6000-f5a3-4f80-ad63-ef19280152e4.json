The England squad he returned to last summer was markedly different to the one he left in New Zealand at the end of a torrid World Cup campaign. The expected victory over Italy at Twickenham on Sunday would take England back to where they were in 2011, one victory away from the grand slam, but it is the only meaningful parallel. England go to Cardiff next Saturday, rather than Dublin, having one day fewer to prepare than their opponents, arguably stronger than at any time since they won the World Cup, and before it the grand slam, in 2003. The current squad is less experienced, but a common denominator is strength in depth, as the struggle for places in the back row shows. Haskell is one of nine players to have started in the back row in the 15 matches that Stuart Lancaster has been the head coach and eight different combinations have been used. With the captain and open-side flanker, Chris Robshaw, a virtual ever-present, the changes and rotation have mainly come on the blindside, the position Haskell fills against Italy, and No8. Lancaster reflected this month that when all his back-rowers are fit \u2013 Ben Morgan, Tom Johnson and Calum Clark are currently unavailable \u2013 he and his fellow coaches will have a dilemma about who to leave out of the 33-strong elite squad when it is revised in July, never mind matchday 23s and starting lineups. Lancaster has changed his blindside in each round of this year's Six Nations, starting with Tom Wood, who then moved to No8 to cover for Morgan and was replaced by Haskell, who was succeeded by Courtney Lawes in the last round against France. Haskell is now back, but he faces the challenge of the fit-again Tom Croft and the No8, Billy Vunipola, who gives the head coach the option of moving Wood back to six; they are both on the bench. \"The real battle is to be part of the matchday 23,\" Haskell says. \"It is great to have Crofty back: I am not sure people realise just how serious his neck injury was. There are guys in the back row coming out of the woodwork. There is no one sitting in an armchair and thinking how comfortable it is. You have to lay it down every time you get a chance. Everyone looks at the players they are vying with and it is a competitive, positive environment. You know you have to provide stand-out moments. \"In other teams, people would get really frustrated at sitting on the bench but I am being genuine when I say that with England every player wants to be in the 23. Being picked to start is the greatest honour, but because of the way Stuart does things, those who are on the bench know they have an important role. It is not a case of the starting XV against the subs, we are all in it together. The number on your back does not matter.\" Lancaster used his bench to telling effect against France, bringing on Haskell on 51 minutes along with the front-rowers Tom Youngs and Mako Vunipola. A match that had been delicately poised tilted England's way and all three will start against an Italy side that cannot draw on anywhere near the same resources. They are merely relieved to have their captain and talisman Sergio Parisse back after his appeal for verbally insulting a referee while playing in the Top 14 last month was halved on appeal. Haskell was a clubmate of the No8 for two years at Stade Fran\u00e7ais and his invitations to meet for a coffee were not answered. \"It is good that he is back because you want to test yourself against the best and Sergio is certainly that,\" says Haskell. \"He is a world-class player but he is down-to-earth and knows how to relax. He has a cushion to express himself at Stade and if you do that with some people, you create a monster. Not in his case: he leads by example, full of fire and passion, and from him I learned to be confident with ball in hand, looking to take on opponents.\" Italy have never defeated England in the Six Nations and if the match goes the way of recent encounters at Twickenham, England will on Sunday evening be the champions-elect, armed with an unassailable points difference, leaving them to concentrate on the grand slam. \"The slam is a special thing but it is not in our vocabulary,\" says Haskell. \"I remember as a fan watching England teams win it \u2013 Will Carling being chaired off Twickenham comes to mind \u2013 but the last week has been all about Italy. They have some great players and we respect them. They have developed their game a lot as everyone saw when they beat France. \"I have probably played against them more than anyone else in the side. They are always physical and aggressive at the breakdown, they are well coached and we have to be on the money in defence because they play with skill as well as conviction. \"We have not mentioned points difference, all that matters is performance, getting stuff like the set pieces and defence right. If we achieve that, the result will take care of itself.\" And grand slam will enter England's lexicon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
