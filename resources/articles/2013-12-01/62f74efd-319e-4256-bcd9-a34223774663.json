By all accounts he wasn't everybody's choice for the gold medal, and certainly this disc, taken from his performances during the recital rounds of the competition, suggests that despite the hype he isn't about to take the musical world by storm. On its own terms, his playing is impressive enough: like so many Russian-trained pianists of his generation, Kholodenko demonstrates an iron-clad technique, and he is also capable of moments of crystalline delicacy. But any sense of a real personality behind the notes is hard to make out. The Petrushka movements sometimes try too hard for rhetorical effects in music that simply doesn't need them, while here and in some of the Liszt Studies, overpedalling blurs textures that ought to be much crisper and cleaner. For some reason the recording of the longest of the Studies, Ricordanza, comes from a studio performance in Moscow in 2008 rather than from the competition; but as in the rest of the set, real character is in short supply."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
