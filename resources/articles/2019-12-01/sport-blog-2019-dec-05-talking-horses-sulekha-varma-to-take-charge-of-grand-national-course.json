It was a finish that allowed the 23-year-old to show off her skills as she repeatedly switched whip hands and eventually persuaded her mount to edge past a rival who was hanging into her. Though she is not one of the most demonstrative riders in the weighing room, Doyle was clearly moved by the achievement, possibly because she has had some near misses in the five days since drawing level with the record, set by Josephine Gordon two years ago. \u201cI feel a bit emotional, actually,\u201d Doyle said on dismounting. She described herself as \u201creally grateful\u201d and \u201cvery lucky\u201d. \u201cTwo out, I thought we\u2019d get there nice and easy, but he had to work hard for it,\u201d she said of Class Clown. \u201cHalf a furlong out, I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get by, but the penny dropped eventually.\u201d Doyle\u2019s year has been notable for the number and variety of trainers who have opted to use her on horses with a winning chance, so it was fitting that Class Clown should be her first success for the trainer concerned, David Barron. \u201cI\u2019m delighted for her,\u201d Barron said. \u201cShe gave him a very good ride, as he wouldn\u2019t be the most straightforward of horses, but she got him going. She is very strong in a finish.\u201d There was also praise from the Lambourn trainer Archie Watson, whose patronage has catapulted Doyle to prominence this year, the pair of them teaming up for 42 wins. \u201cThe main thing with Hollie is she gives them a ride every time,\u201d he said. \u201cI know all jockeys make mistakes, but I think she makes less than most, she\u2019s very consistent. She deserves every success, she works very hard and is a very talented jockey.\u201d Approached for a reaction by Sky Sports Racing, Gordon was in cheerful mood. \u201cI would have liked to have held the record longer, but I\u2019m not going to be too fussy,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s a grafter and she deserves it. We\u2019re going to see more records broken in the next couple of years by the girls and maybe it won\u2019t be such a big deal, in time.\u201d Hayley Turner, whose 20-year career has been a game-changer for female jockeys in Flat racing, offered her congratulations through Twitter. \u201cWell done Hollie Doyle who today raised the bar for the lady jockeys,\u201d tweeted the 36-year-old, who achieved 100 winners in her best year. Varma on course for Grand National The job of looking after the Grand National course falls vacant about four times a century, on recent trends, so Sulekha Varma is counting herself very lucky to get it at the age of just 34. \u201cI\u2019m over the moon,\u201d she said on Thursday as the news began to sink in. \u201cI\u2019m fully aware of what a big challenge the job will be but I know how things operate there.\u201d That\u2019s because running Aintree during the National meeting is not a one-man job. For those three days, the Jockey Club brings its clerks of the course from around the country to Liverpool to help out, so if you walk the track you\u2019re as likely to bump into Simon Claisse or Kirkland Tellwright as Andrew Tulloch, who has been Aintree\u2019s clerk for the last 24 years. It\u2019s odd to see those familiar figures of authority in the one place, working together, a bit like Avengers Assemble for racing geeks. Varma has been with the Jockey Club over the last 10 years, doing her training at Haydock and then clerking at Nottingham, Market Rasen, Warwick, Huntingdon and Hamilton. And each April, she would travel to Aintree for experience that will now stand her in excellent stead. \u201cI\u2019ve been there when there was a lot going on, changes, new ways of working, new protocols and procedures. My first year was Ballabriggs\u2019s year, which brought about the changes in the pull-up area and the wash-down area. It was my job was to oversee that area and its function, once it had been redeveloped. I then moved on to assisting Andrew directly, so I was in the stewards\u2019 box with him, running a lot of comms and being there if he got pulled away to do something else. The race after the National, I often clerked that so that he could deal with press conferences. \u201cI\u2019ve thankfully had a lot of experience. I think there will still be a huge amount to learn but the structure and the set-up, I have a good understanding of.\u201d Bright and funny, Varma is one of the most approachable of Britain\u2019s clerks and her ability to communicate and co-ordinate should be very valuable in the new role. Born in Cardiff and raised near Dundee, she can be claimed as one of their own by large parts of the country. She studied Classics at Durham University, which must be handy in inquiries when one of the more longstanding stewards starts declaiming in Latin. Equine welfare will be at the heart of her work at Aintree and Varma has long had a love of horses, having ridden since she was a child. Her first memory of the National was watching Miinnehoma win it when she was nine. Tulloch started in the role the following year. It was a work placement at Lucinda Russell\u2019s yard that switched her on to racing. \u201cWe were packed off there for a week. One trip up the gallops and that was it, I was absolutely hooked.\u201d She remembers riding Kerry Lads, who was twice placed in the Scottish Grand National. Between Durham and the Jockey Club, Varma was briefly a journalist at the Racing Post. The fact that she did not continue as a racing scribe reflects well on her intelligence, it could be argued. Good luck to her. The whole sport would be delighted if she got a smooth run for years to come."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
