The cyberworld, it seems, is no exception. The proliferation of parents and teachers trawling Facebook trying to poke old schoolfriends and lovers, and traversing the outer reaches of MySpace is causing an adolescent exodus from social networking sites, according to research from the media regulator Ofcom. The sites, once virtual streetcorners, pubs and clubs for millions of 15- to 24-year-olds, have now been over-run by 25- to 34-year-olds whose presence is driving their younger peers away. Although their love of being online shows no sign of abating, the percentage of 15- to 24-year-olds who have a profile on a social networking site has dropped for the first time \u2013 from 55% at the start of last year to 50% this year. In contrast, 46% of 25- to 34-year-olds are now regularly checking up on sites such as Facebook compared with 40% last year. Overall, 30% of British adults have a social networking profile, against 21% in 2007 when Ofcom first did the research. Half the UK's online population have a Facebook profile and spend an average of nearly six hours a month on the site. \"There is nothing to suggest overall usage of the internet among 15-to 24-year-olds is going down,\" said Peter Phillips, the regulator's head of strategy. \"Data suggests they are spending less time on social networking sites.\" James Thickett, director of market research at Ofcom, said that while older people seemed to be embracing social networking sites, Facebook and MySpace remained immensely popular with children under 16. \"Clearly take-up among under 16-year-olds is very high \u2026 so we cannot say for certain whether this is people in a certain age group who are not setting up social networking profiles or whether it's a population shift which is reflecting people getting older and having a social networking profile that they set up two years ago,\" he said. \"The main point is the profile of social networking users is getting older.\" The arrival of the 25- to 34-year-old age group, meanwhile, also appears to be behind the explosion in usage of Twitter, which has shot up from 100,000 British users in May last year to 2.6 million this year. Ofcom's annual snapshot of the UK's media and communications landscape also shows Britons spent an average of 225 minutes a day watching TV last year, just a minute longer than in 2003, but internet usage has ballooned \u2013 to 25 minutes a day from just nine minutes in 2003. Mobile phone usage has almost doubled to 11 minutes, as people make fewer calls on their landlines, with people now spending an average of just 13 minutes, compared with 15 minutes in 2003. The report also shows some dramatic regional variations in the take-up and use of communications services. London leads the way in broadband take-up with 78% of households online, compared with a national average of 68%, while Glasgow lies in last place with 39%. The low take-up of broadband access may also explain why fewer Glaswegians use social networking sites than the residents of any other British city \u2013 just 12%. The residents of Norwich are the most sociable online, with 45% of all adults on social networks regularly. More people use the internet to make phone calls in Aberdeen \u2013 almost a third of the population \u2013 than anywhere else; the national average is 12%. Much of the take-up is among oil rig workers who want to stay in touch with family without mammoth phone bills. The research shows that mobile phones are ubiquitous, and last year, customers sent more than 80bn texts, or 100 texts per person per month \u2013 a rise of 29% on 2007. But the Welsh seem to have embraced 3G mobile phone services more than anyone else, with 56% on a 3G network compared with only a third in London. Perhaps as a result, Cardiff has more mobile-only households \u2013 where inhabitants have ditched their old BT line \u2013 than the rest of the country. The research also shows that despite the recession, households do not want to cut backspending on television, broadband and mobile telephony. Asked where they were going to economise, consumers named going out, holidays, DIY, gym membership, books, DVDs, clothing and newspapers as areas they would cut before reducing their outgoings for mobile phones, TV subscriptions and broadband access. Among the 15- to 24-year-olds, one area where they do not expect to spend any money is music. Despite the continuing efforts of the industry and government to clamp down on illegal music sharing, Ofcom asked 15- to 24-year-olds if they thought it was morally acceptable to download music for free and 66% said yes. To combat piracy, a host of legitimate free services have sprung up, such as Spotify, which rely on advertising. Overall, a quarter of the population admit to the unauthorised sharing of music online and 5% admit doing so regularly. However, most unauthorised sharing is done by copying CDs, with 37% saying they have let someone else copy something from their collection."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
