The chairman David Bernstein has secured the backing of the US investment bank Bear Stearns with a deal which in time could total \u00a344m. The bank has initially brokered a \u00a330m bond, based on City's loyal fan base. \"The deal is secured on the future sales of season and matchday tickets. The loyalty of our supporters was a key factor,\" Bernstein said. \"When we presented the proposal the fact that we had 28,000 fans in the Second Division was crucial. \"This is not a bonanza; the substantial funds need careful handling. This creates a building block for the future, and provides the club with even more stability.\" It is understood City were able to secure this funding up until 2027. The timing is ideal as Kevin Keegan has spent \u00a321m since the year ended on new players. The club has also continued to invest in state-of-the-art training facilities at Carrington and in preparing the City of Manchester Stadium ahead of the club's arrival next year. City returned to the Premiership this season after a year in the First Division. The club's financial report reveals that after their relegation season the turnover dipped by \u00a34m, from \u00a332m to \u00a328m. But despite a slide in television cash and gate receipts, merchandising and sponsorship activities all rose impressively. Mohamed Al Fayed confirmed yesterday that Fulham have identified two sites for a new ground in west London. Fulham are playing at QPR's Loftus Road base for two seasons while a group of local residents fight a two-pronged legal battle to prevent Craven Cottage's proposed \u00a370m revamp into a 28,000 all-seater stadium. Fayed, the Fulham chairman, said \"The players and the fans need their own home - when you share, you feel you don't own the club 100%.\" \"We're looking at various ways of increasing the capacity [at Craven Cottage], but it would be prudent to make alternative plans should that not prove possible. \"So we're exploring the possibility of one or two other sites in west London as a fall-back position.\" Fulham, whose original reluctance to quit Craven Cottage has been overcome by the residents' long legal fight, made an unsuccessful bid for a new stadium site in July - the 10.3 acre former milk distribution depot just round the corner from Loftus Road. Fayed spoke of his anger at the many obstacles halting Craven Cottage's redevelopment - and disclosed he could ask the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham for assistance in finding a site for a new ground. \"Redeveloping remains our priority,\" he added. \"We're still fighting the residents and still have to go to court. We hope to go back but can't wait 10 years. \"We're waiting to see if we can win. But if it's going to take time, the council has to help us find a new location.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
