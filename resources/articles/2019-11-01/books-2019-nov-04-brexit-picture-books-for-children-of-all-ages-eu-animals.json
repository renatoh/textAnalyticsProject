Two new picture books attempt to make Brexit accessible to children. Smriti Prasadam-Halls and Robert Starling\u2019s The Little Island sees a gaggle of geese hatch a plan to leave their farm, only for their solitary life on an island to go wrong. And in Richard David Lawman and Katie Williams\u2019 I Want to Leave This Book, a cast of animals vote \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 on which sort of story they\u2019d like to be part of. Prasadam-Halls\u2019 modern-day fable, described by Gruffalo illustrator Axel Scheffler as \u201can Animal Farm for our times\u201d, has already sold out of its first print run. A paperback edition is now being brought forward to meet demand. \u201cIn The Little Island, I\u2019ve tried to translate the complexity of recent events into a story simple and satisfying enough for the youngest \u2013 and oldest \u2013 child to grasp and to present a conversation starter, a launchpad, to some of the more serious issues of our time,\u201d says Prasadam-Halls, whose book opens with a quote from one John Duck: \u201cNo goose is an island entire of itself; every goose is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.\u201d Before writing the book, she had been deeply troubled by the changes she was seeing in British society. \u201cWe\u2019ve started to hear words being used again that we have long considered to be totally unacceptable. It has been so troubling to hear aggressive slogans and toxic language used in the highest of offices. Language has such power and when words are used as weapons they cause great damage,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I have tried to speak a story of solidarity and friendship into that landscape.\u201d Her setting felt \u201cabsolutely natural\u201d for a dissection of the divide between leave and remain. \u201cFarmyard animals lend friendliness and charm and bring unexpected humour and warmth to what might otherwise feel a heavy topic \u2013 especially as we see ourselves parodied in the story,\u201d she says. \u201cThey also help us to feel a degree of empathy for all the characters \u2013 whichever side of the bridge they are \u2026 Animals help us get closer to the heart of the issues and feel a shared humanity.\u201d Animals also dominate Lawman\u2019s picture book, published by Manchester-based WatAdventure, although in more specific roles: Theresa May appears as a hamster, Boris Johnson is depicted as a highland cow and David Cameron is a pig named Percy Hogtrotter. It sees the animals debating whether they are better off staying in the book, or leaving for a better experience in another. When a majority votes to leave, they can\u2019t agree on what genre they want to be in. Lawman says he came up with the book when he realised he couldn\u2019t explain Brexit to his curious four-year-old daughter: \u201cI Want to Leave This Book is the answer to my dilemma \u2013 and clearly one that parents across the UK are facing.\u201d WatAdventure surveyed 1,000 UK parents to discover that while 70% of children knew the term Brexit, only 27% of parents could give a detailed explanation of what was going on to their offspring. Another 8% admitted that they felt so confused about the situation themselves that they couldn\u2019t clarify it for their kids. Both Prasadam-Halls and Lawman are clear that the books had to work on their own, as well as acting as Brexit explainers. \u201cThe other reason for using animals, of course, is for the purposes of allegory. Parents and teachers have the choice of whether they want to go deeper with the story \u2013 or not. It stands as a story in its own right,\u201d says Prasadam-Halls. \u201cWe need to make these complex political issues as digestible as possible to ensure that younger generations truly engage and understand the wider moral backdrop of these events,\u201d says Lawman. \u201cBut first and foremost, we wanted this book to be fun to read, even without the Brexit context.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
