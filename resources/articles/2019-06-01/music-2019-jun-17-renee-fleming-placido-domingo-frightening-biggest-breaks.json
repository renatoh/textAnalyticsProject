I needed help to get off the stage'", "bodyText": "She sang at the inauguration of Barack Obama and at the diamond jubilee concert thrown for the Queen. She also performed at senator John McCain\u2019s funeral and at Prince Charles\u2019s 70th-birthday bash. Yet here\u2019s Ren\u00e9e Fleming today, sitting in a dowdy London studio, eating salad from a cardboard box and feeling somewhat daunted. \u201cIt is terrifying,\u201d she says, of her part in the Tony-winning musical The Light in the Piazza. \u201cThere\u2019s so much dialogue, which is not a skill I\u2019ve practised much. But I\u2019ve always had a voracious love of musical adventure.\u201d Fortunately, her friend John Malkovich has given her some advice. \u201cHe told me, \u2018You just have to put in the hours.\u2019 That made me feel better.\u201d Fleming\u2019s confession comes as a surprise, given that she is a star who has been at the very top for more than three decades, with a repertoire that runs to more than 50 of opera\u2019s great soprano roles. The Light in the Piazza, composed by Adam Guettel, is a bit of a departure for her, though: not only does it mix musical genres, but it throws her in with quite a varied bunch. Her daughter, Clara, is played by 23-year-old Dove Cameron, best known for playing both title characters in the Disney Channel\u2019s twins comedy Liv and Maddie. When should a mother let go of her daughter. That\u2019s the dilemma that faces, Margaret, when Clara falls in love during a sight-seeing tour of Italy. Her predicament is laid out in the opening song of the musical, which is being staged at London\u2019s Royal Festival Hall. Fleming, who is 60 and based in New York, has two adult daughters of her own, but this is the first time she has played a mother on stage. It is the fate of the lyric soprano whose voice doesn\u2019t age to be locked into younger parts and romantic repertoire. But two years ago, she called time on one of her signature roles: the Marschallin, an aristocrat who takes a young lover in Strauss\u2019s Der Rosenkavalier. \u201cMost of my roles were ingenues and I said, enough is enough \u2013 it\u2019s not really working any more. It was time to give someone new a chance.\u201d Far from putting the brakes on her career, this proved a breakout moment. The two years since have been full of theatre, with an eight-month Broadway run of Carousel followed by an edgy off-Broadway show, Norma Jeane Baker of Troy. In the latter, Fleming played a speccy stenographer hired by businessman Ben Whishaw, whose efforts to understand the iconography of Marilyn Monroe \u2013 via Greek myth \u2013 lead him to metamorphose into her. Not only did Fleming appear in person, but her sampled disembodied voice became the soundscape of the show. It is not only on stage that Fleming\u2019s voice has developed a life of its own: there can\u2019t be many movie-goers who haven\u2019t heard it, though they may not realise. Fleming did the vocals for Twilight and Shadow, a song from The Lord of the Rings written in Sindarin, the tongue invented by JRR Tolkien to be spoken by the Immortal Elves of his Middle Earth. More recently, she was the voice of Bianca Castafiore, the Captain Haddock-bothering opera singer in Steven Spielberg\u2019s The Adventures of Tintin \u2013 her top C electronically ratcheted up to a glass-breaking top F. Last year alone, her singing featured on Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Oscar-winning The Shape of Water and \u2013 unbeknown even to her \u2013 contributed to Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Its soundtrack includes her recording of Last Rose of Summer, from the opera Martha. \u201cThey licensed it,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know until I saw it in a review.\u201d What is it that keeps her seeking out new musical adventures? \u201cBrave or crazy, I don\u2019t know which, but I work a lot,\u201d she says, attributing her work ethic to her Czech ancestry. Both her mother and father were music teachers. \u201cI wanted to be the first lady president or a veterinarian.\u201d On BBC Radio Four\u2019s Desert Island Discs in 2005, she chose her own performance of Joni Mitchell\u2019s River. \u201cI was probably 16 or 17 when I heard Joni Mitchell and thought, \u2018That\u2019s my voice.\u2019 I played the guitar and went through a whole singer-songwriter era.\u201d It was a rebellion of sorts for a \u201cgood girl who wanted to be bad, to wear nylons and smoke in the bathroom\u201d. At college, she sang with a jazz trio, only opting decisively for a classical career after being forced to choose between dropping out to tour with the Illinois Jacquet Big Band or going on to graduate school. Fleming\u2019s career has been so dazzling, it is a surprise to learn how slow it was to take off. In her early 20s, she failed a big audition but now regards it as a blessing. \u201cMy voice wasn\u2019t worked out, I had a lot of technical flaws.\u201d She took herself off for classes with legendary soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, who piled shame on her: \u201cYou were either \u2018golden\u2019 or you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to sing at all.\u201d One of several bouts of stage fright followed. How has that experience informed the masterclasses that she now gives to young singers? \u201cI don\u2019t use the singers to make the audience laugh,\u201d she says, pointedly. By her own account, her biggest break came in her mid-30s, through an understudy role. The Desdemona in a top-flight production of Verdi\u2019s Otello hurt her back, plunging Fleming into the part \u2013 and a confrontation scene with a giant she had never even met: Pl\u00e1cido Domingo. \u201cHe was so frightening that, by the end, I needed help to get off the stage,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when it was over, he held out his hand and said, \u2018Hello, I\u2019m Pl\u00e1cido Domingo.\u2019 It\u2019s very important to be prepared. That Otello put me on the map.\u201d She continued to sing Desdemona up to 2012. Perhaps her most life-changing break happened off stage, though, after she was introduced to author Ann Patchett by someone who mistakenly believed that Fleming was the inspiration for Bel Canto, Patchett\u2019s Orange prize-winning novel about an opera singer taken hostage. The two women became close friends. And Patchett introduced her to a lawyer friend of hers, Tim Jessell, who in 2011 became Fleming\u2019s second husband. Fleming went on to provide Julianne Moore\u2019s singing voice in last year\u2019s film adaptation of Bel Canto. \u201cI love finding interesting ways of making classical singing accessible to the rest of the world,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause the opera world is increasingly small. We\u2019ve been presenting it in the same way for so long that it\u2019s ceased to be relevant.\u201d Which is why she is so keen to venture beyond the classical repertoire. Between performances, recordings and masterclasses, she works with Washington\u2019s Kennedy Center, bringing neurologists and artists together to promote the use of music for people with brain injuries. In 2009, after a guest appearance on Elvis Costello\u2019s TV show, Spectacle, she was signed on for an album, Dark Hope, covering songs by Leonard Cohen, Jefferson Airplane and Tears for Fears. It\u2019s a mark of the importance of family to Fleming that her backing singers on Dark Hope included her cabaret-singer sister, Rachelle, and her own daughters, Amelia and Sage. They are now 26 and 28 and, although both were promising singers, they showed no sign of allowing themselves to be \u201cindentured\u201d into a musical career. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard lifestyle,\u201d says Fleming with a laugh, \u201cand they know too much.\u201d \u2022 The Light in the Piazza is at Royal Festival Hall, London, until 5 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
