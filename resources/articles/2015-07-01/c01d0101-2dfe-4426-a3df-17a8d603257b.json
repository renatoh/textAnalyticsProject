It said the reduction \u2013 which is likely to trigger similar moves by rivals \u2013 meant that for the first time in 14 years, average diesel prices would be cheaper than unleaded. Diesel prices have started coming down after motoring organisations criticised retailers for their high costs. Earlier this month the RAC Foundation suggested that drivers of the 10.7m diesel cars on Britain\u2019s roads had been overcharged by as much as \u00a3250m in recent weeks because retailers had not passed on plummeting wholesale prices. On 9 July \u2013 the day after George Osborne froze fuel duty once more in the summer budget \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Asda all typically cut the cost of diesel by 2p per litre at their combined total of 1,400 filling stations. At the time, Asda said drivers filling up at its forecourts would pay no more than 114.7p a litre for diesel, matching the cost of its unleaded petrol - the first time both fuels had been the same price since 2010. Morrisons said that for commercial reasons it did not disclose the average price of a litre of diesel. According to the website PetrolPrices.com, the average cost of a litre of diesel at a UK filling station at the end of last week was 118.21p, while the lowest available price was 112.9p. The latest Morrisons cut of up to 2p a litre at its 336 petrol stations from 20 July is likely to prompt a fresh round of price reductions. The supermarket said the last time UK diesel pump prices were lower than unleaded was 2001. A spokesman added: \u201cBecause of the recent price drops in the wholesale diesel price, we are able to pass on these savings \u2026 Many younger drivers won\u2019t remember the last time that diesel prices were lower than unleaded.\u201d It may amount to welcome news for drivers of diesel cars who, the RAC Foundation said less than a fortnight ago, \u201ccould be forgiven for feeling short-changed\u201d because pump prices were lagging so far behind wholesale prices. And only last month, a report from the Post Office\u2019s travel money arm had pointed out that the UK was the only one of 22 European countries surveyed where diesel cost more than unleaded petrol. However, there will be \u201ca handful\u201d of Morrisons filling stations where diesel prices will remain higher than unleaded because of \u201clocal competitive factors\u201d. And there was no word from Morrisons on when, or if, unleaded prices would come down; the supermarket said it would \u201ccontinue to look for opportunities to pass on savings on unleaded as soon as we can\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
