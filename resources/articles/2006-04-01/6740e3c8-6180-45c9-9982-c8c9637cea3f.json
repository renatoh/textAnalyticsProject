The party Capote threw in 1966 should really have been a good career move, too: a way of knitting together his dual obsessions with society and writing to their mutual enhancement. Capote's 'non-fiction novel', In Cold Blood, appeared in January 1966 and was already one of the greatest PR successes in the history of publishing when its author conceived of hosting a masked ball. The New York Times had described the book, bizarrely, as 'the hottest property since the invention of the wheel'. Capote's rigorous account of the Clutter murders in Kansas had brought him friends and admirers from the very different worlds of Washington, Los Angeles and New York, and for a social butterfly the obvious way of celebrating the adulation and cementing his celebrity was to throw a party. His new best friend, 'Kay' Graham, who had recently become owner of the Washington Post, would be guest of honour. Capote's black and white ball was a party as performance art; it has been a reference point for glossy magazines ever since, and frequently imitated (for example, by Sean 'Puffy' Combs). Davis's exhaustive account of the night, its genesis and preparations is, like the event itself, alternately fascinating and infuriating. Fascinating, because the guests included Noel Coward and Arthur Miller, Philip Roth and Lauren Bacall, Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow, Henry Ford and Vivien Leigh, James Baldwin and Irving Berlin, JK Galbraith and dozens of other names still famous 40 years later. Capote claimed he made 500 friends and 15,000 enemies the day the invitations went out. At a pivotal moment in social history, Capote was one of the first Americans to mix up old-money privilege with pop artists, models and photographers. Infuriating, because Davis makes little attempt to establish a critical distance from her subject matter. It's not difficult to see why Capote felt such a need to surround himself with the women he rather tiresomely called his swans, and who were invariably leggy, rich and privileged: Babe Paley, Gloria Guinness, CZ Guest, Marella Agnelli, Slim Keith, Lee Radziwill. These elegant, idle creatures were what his mother had aspired to be. It is harder to understand why he subsequently wrote about them so destructively, wrecking friendships with zeal. Davis gets nowhere near excavating the self-hatred that Capote must have felt to smash up his life after such startling initial social and literary success. Sometimes reading this book feels like eating too many sweets. 'At Truman's ball,' Davis writes with no sense of irony, discussing the decor, 'the gorgeous swans and all the other beautiful people would be the flowers.' Still, surface can be gripping, and the details of dresses, hairstyles, masks and months of preparation are very enjoyable in a voyeuristic way - though it's a pity that the night itself only gets one chapter, in which not much happens except that Frank Sinatra leaves early. In the end, the significance of the party was less who danced with whom (which we don't find out) than that it occurred at the very moment that aristocracy began to give way to celebrity. Capote straddled both worlds, and his party was a sign of the seismic forces at work beneath the polite surface of American society. Oddly for such a self-promoter, and completely unexplained by this book, having made his grand statement, Capote collapsed, unable to make anything more of it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
