Cressida Dick\u2019s tribute came during a funeral service for Ratana, whose killing in September in a custody suite at Croydon station in south London, stunned policing and communities where he had served. A picture emerged of an unconventional officer, supremely professional, warm of heart and big of spirit. Ratana, 54, was born in New Zealand, with M\u0101ori heritage, and had served as a police officer there and across London. The service, held in English and M\u0101ori, complied with Covid-19 regulations and was streamed online so friends and family in New Zealand, and thousands of police colleagues could also pay tribute. Dick said: \u201cMatt was a fantastic professional police officer, a brilliant sergeant, a leader, a supremely loyal colleague, and friend \u2026 He mentored and coached generations of officers, young and old, junior and senior \u2026 as enthusiastic after 25 years as he was after two.\u201d The commissioner said Ratana spoke to everyone as an equal, be they homeless or powerful: \u201cMost of the countless people he arrested parted from him with a handshake.\u201d The commissioner told the story of Ratana\u2019s unorthodox methods when he and a more senior colleague faced an angry crowd while on duty at a protest: \u201cMatt unceremoniously picked the commander up and placed her behind him. Then launched into a haka [a traditional M\u0101ori battle dance], thereby amazing and distracting the crowds and defusing the situation sufficiently to allow a reasonably dignified if very hasty retreat.\u201d Friends and colleagues at the service in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, tried to keep their grief at bay as they paid tribute to the officer who was close to retirement after 29 years service. His partner, Su Bushby, whose words were read by a friend, told of Ratana\u2019s love of rugby, which he had played and coached. She said: \u201cIn any situation or room he walked into, his presence would always be felt. Like a big ball of energy. You were taken far too soon. Your gym, rugby and policing family will help your legacy, your kindness, and your spirit live on. \u201cYou have touched so many people\u2019s lives, you will be truly missed. My life has been richer and funnier for knowing you and I feel blessed you were in my life.\u201d Rylan Morlen, Ratana\u2019s friend from East Grinstead rugby club, remembered his final words to the fallen officer, made achingly poignant by the manner of his passing. Morlen said: \u201cWe all miss you and wish that we could turn back the clock so that you didn\u2019t leave for your shift on 24 September. \u201cI love you, we love you, and your legacy will always live on \u2026 Back to my final words to you as the office door closed: \u2018Be safe, mate.\u2019 Sadly that wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d During the service a montage of photos of Ratana with friends and loved ones were shown. After the service, the former All Blacks\u2019 captain Zinzan Brooke led a haka outside the chapel, along with members of the London-based New Zealand culture group Ngati Ranana. The hearse carrying Ratana\u2019s coffin then paused to be saluted by the commissioner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
