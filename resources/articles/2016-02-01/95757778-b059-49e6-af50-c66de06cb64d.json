You put the meat in and put the temperature on low then it just simmers for a while. That\u2019s where we are at the moment.\u201d As England\u2019s coach will shortly appreciate, however, serving up the perfect Six Nations dish is rarely that easy. For all the talk of fresh starts, the championship spits out anyone who is even fractionally hesitant off the mark. Two years ago England lost by two points in France in their opening game and even four subsequent wins could not secure them the title. Jones\u2019s first match in charge, given the scant time he has spent with his squad, is more about lobbing a few hastily identified burgers under the grill and hoping they defrost in time. Hence his desire to try to make Scotland stop and think by casting them as favourites. Mind games have long been among his trademark skills in contrast to Stuart Lancaster and Martin Johnson who preferred to respect their next opponents to death. On Monday, for example, Jones even offered to write to his opposite number, Vern Cotter, to apologise for suggesting the hosts should be favourites. \u201cI know he was upset about that so I apologise to Vern. If you want me to write a letter, I\u2019ll write a letter of apology. We\u2019re happy to be favourites. We\u2019ve had a good preparation and we\u2019ll go in there confident about playing well.\u201d All good knockabout stuff and Jones is a past master. He has long believed that simply sitting in press conferences and reading out the latest groin-strain updates is a waste of everyone\u2019s time. \u201cEvery time we talk to the media we are trying to find a way to win. I don\u2019t see that as mind games, it\u2019s just part of the process. I think it is an important part of the game. Warren Gatland does it exceedingly well, doesn\u2019t he? Clive Woodward wasn\u2019t too bad at it and he\u2019s knighted. So he was knighted for doing mind games!\u201d It was Woodward who criticised the poor feng shui in the away dressing room at Murrayfield after England\u2019s win there in 2004, suggesting a large pillar had been deliberately placed to \u201cscrew up\u201d the feel of the room. As England won comfortably it cannot have been too bad but Jones, despite an unbeaten record in Edinburgh with Australia, is also wary. \u201cThe Scottish are canny people. I remember the time the pitch was being re-marked three hours before the game. The [English] guys are telling me you get to within 10 minutes of the ground and a host of bagpipers appear and do a slow march in front of the bus. People painted with blue crosses are going to be screaming and yelling. That\u2019s what Test match rugby is about, isn\u2019t it?\u201d His firm belief is that outcome matters rather more than how England are perceived north of the border. \u201cArrogance is only bad when you lose. If you are winning and you are arrogant then it is self-belief. We\u2019re going to believe we are going to be the best team in the world. If that\u2019s being arrogant then it is being arrogant. To me it is belief about what we can be.\u201d The first step is to crank up their forward power, with extra running and pre-dawn gym sessions already the norm. Some are finding it a culture shock. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit depressing walking over to the gym in the dark at 6.30am,\u201d said the prop Mako Vunipola, but Jones is unapologetic. \u201cWe\u2019ve just jumped in the pool and we\u2019re only at the shallow end at the moment. We\u2019ve still got the deep end to go. By Saturday night we\u2019re going to know a lot more about the team and I think it\u2019s going to be pretty good.\u201d Whether they sink or swim in Edinburgh will be fascinating. The Northampton tighthead Kieran Brookes may be available and it is hoped his club-mate Courtney Lawes will train fully on Thursday. If not, Maro Itoje could conceivably be promoted to the 23 after impressing the watching Jones during Saracens\u2019 weekend home win against Bath. Jones also confirmed he remains in regular contact with Sale\u2019s Danny Cipriani \u2013 \u201cHe knows he\u2019s in the picture but we can\u2019t pick everyone\u201d \u2013 and has his eyes peeled for whoever appropriated his birthday cake at the weekend. \u201cI did get a cake. I think someone took it, though \u2026 maybe one of the props.\u201d Vunipola hinted there may well have been sticky fingers in camp. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put anyone in it but I just want to clear my name,\u201d said the loosehead. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
