But it appals me, 15 September), a phenomenon with parallels in rather too many parts of Europe. That said, we should also acknowledge that, however inadequate Lithuanian memorialisation of the Holocaust may be, it is in many ways an improvement on that found in the Soviet Union. Communist party policy ignored sites of Jewish suffering for decades, attested to most famously by the lengthy struggles involving Yevtushenko, Shostakovich and others for a memorial at Babi Yar in Kiev. Even if eventually constructed, monuments referred blandly to \"Soviet citizens\" or \"victims of fascism\". By contrast, most killing sites in Lithuania are now at least marked with memorials which explicitly mention the identity of the victims and, very occasionally, the perpetrators. Jonathan is, though, sadly correct in noting that few Lithuanians pay them any heed. Martin Winstone Author, The Holocaust Sites of Europe \u2022 Lithuania has taken more than a \"walk-on part in British politics\". When the European parliament called on its members, in April 2009, to mark 23 August as the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism, and when the OSCE, in July 2009, adopted the Vilnius Declaration on increasing awareness of totalitarian crimes, we too became party to the equation of Nazi crimes with those of communism in the Baltic states. By accepting the parallelism, we also have excused collaborators, ignored the unspeakable savageries perpetrated in Lithuania between 1941 and 1945, condoned the pardoning of every single Lithuanian war criminal until today, and endorsed the prosecution of Jewish resistance fighters, whose situation remains unresolved.
