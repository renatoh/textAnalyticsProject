The Libyans\u2019 accusation reopens controversy over the 2012 pre-election decision by the prosecutor in the case not to bring charges against anyone involved in CIA abuse \u2013 an episode the US State Department has held up as an example of its diligence in complying with international torture obligations. On Wednesday, a United Nations committee in Geneva is scheduled to hear a US delegation outline recent measures Washington has taken to combat torture. It will be the first update the US has provided to the committee since 2006, when the CIA still operated its off-the-books \u201cblack site\u201d prisons. Human rights campaigners who have seen the Obama administration repeatedly decline to deliver justice for US torture victims consider it a belated chance at ending what they consider to be impunity. Among the committee\u2019s requested submissions, issued in 2010, is a description of steps the US has taken to ensure torture claims against it are \u201cpromptly, impartially and thoroughly investigated\u201d. The committee specifically asked for a status update about the Justice Department\u2019s since-concluded torture inquiry. That high-profile inquiry, conducted by assistant US attorney John Durham, wrapped in 2012 without bringing criminal charges against anyone involved in the deaths of two detainees in CIA custody. That decision, heralding the end of federal investigations for post-9/11 detainee abuse, was preceded by Durham\u2019s 2011 announcement that he would not proceed past a \u201cpreliminary review\u201d for 99 out of 101 cases of suspected CIA torture. The State Department, in a 2013 written submission to the UN committee, referred to Durham\u2019s team as \u201cexperienced professionals\u201d that found the \u201cadmissible evidence would not be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d But the Libyans say that neither Durham nor his staff \u201cever sought or requested our testimony\u201d. The five \u2013 Mohammed Ahmed Mohammed al-Shoroeiya, Khalid al-Sharif, Majid Mokhtar Sasy al-Maghrebi, Saleh Hadiyah Abu Abdullah Di\u2019iki and Mustafa Jawda al-Mehdi \u2013 wrote to committee secretary Patrice Gillibert in a 9 November letter urging Gillibert press the US delegation on the investigative omission. All members of the now-defunct Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, an anti-Gaddafi terrorist group with murky ties to al-Qaida, the five spent between eight months and two years in CIA custody before being rendered back to Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s prisons. One of them, Shoroeiya, alleges that the CIA waterboarded him in Afghanistan, although he is not one of the three people on whom the CIA has acknowledged using the controversial mock-drowning technique. Among other torture techniques, they say, their US captors chained them to walls after stripping them naked; blasted deafeningly loud music at them; kept them deprived of sleep for sustained periods and shackled them in painful positions. Sharif told Human Rights Watch that he yelled at his guards:\u201cI want to die, why don\u2019t you just kill me?\u201d Durham\u2019s apparent disinterest in interviewing them \u201craises serious questions about the thoroughness and adequacy of the Durham investigation, whether other important witnesses were also not interviewed for that inquiry, and whether the US has complied with obligations under article 12\u201d of the UN convention against torture, they wrote. Through a representative at the US attorney\u2019s office for Connecticut, Durham declined to comment to the Guardian. It is unknown if Durham interviewed any victims of CIA torture at all, but a lawyer for one of the alleged 9/11 co-conspirators held at Guantanamo Bay said Durham never interviewed his client. \u201cIt\u2019s an omission from their point of view,\u201d said James Connell, attorney for Ammar al-Baluchi, who added that he was unaware of Dunham interviewing any of al-Baluchi\u2019s co-defendants. \u201cI don\u2019t think JTF-GTMO [the Guantanamo detentions command] or the CIA would ever let a civilian prosecutor interview these men. The US government limits what these men can say to anyone who can give them redress,\u201d Connell said. Attorney general Eric Holder, who expanded Durham\u2019s special-prosecutor mandate, praised Durham as an exemplar of investigative probity when the inquiry concluded in August 2012, two months before that year\u2019s presidential election. \u201cMr Durham and his team of agents and prosecutors have worked tirelessly to conduct extraordinarily thorough and complete preliminary reviews and investigations,\u201d Holder said. Laura Pitter, a Human Rights Watch researcher, documented the plight of the five Libyans after discovering caches of secret documentation about their detentions after the 2012 fall of Gaddafi, and spoke to some of them while they were still imprisoned. She said all five could have been available to a Justice Department inquiry that was interested in talking with them. \u201cWe found them. We found them when they were out of jail as well. I assume the FBI has more resources than Human Rights Watch, if they were seriously doing an investigation into torture by US personnel,\u201d said Pitter, who organized the letter to the UN committee. Durham \u201cshould have definitely gone and interviewed the victims,\u201d said Karen Greenberg, who directs Fordham Law School\u2019s Center on National Security. \u201cThe lack of information we have over this is appalling. The informational trail was stopped short of getting to the essence of the crime, which is the torture itself.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
