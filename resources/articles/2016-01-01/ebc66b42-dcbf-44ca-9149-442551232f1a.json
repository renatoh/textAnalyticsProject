In a much-anticipated speech that focused more on what still needed to be done than the limited set of executive actions announced in advance by the White House, the president painted gun reform as the last great civil rights challenge of his generation. \u201cIn Dr King\u2019s words, we need to feel the fierce urgency of now, because people are dying,\u201d a visibly emotional Obama told an audience of mass shooting victims and relatives in the East Room. \u201cOur inalienable right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, those rights were stripped from college kids in Blacksburg and Santa Barbara and from high schoolers at Columbine, and from first-graders in Newtown,\u201d he added, his voice shaking. \u201cFirst-graders. And from every family who never imagined that their loved one would be taken from our lives by a bullet from a gun.\u201d The president had been introduced by Mark Barden, the father of Daniel, one of the 20 young children killed at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown three years ago. As his speech rose to its climax, with tears rolling down his cheeks, Obama said: \u201cEvery time I think about those kids, it gets me mad and, by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day.\u201d In a rhetorical twist designed to undermine arguments against reform, the president insisted his plan to force all buyers of guns to undergo background check was not a \u201cplot to take your guns\u201d but comparable to going through metal detectors to board a plane and merely \u201cthe price of living in a civilised society\u201d. \u201cI believe in the second amendment. It\u2019s there written on the paper \u2026 No matter how much people try to twist my words \u2026 I taught constitutional law. I know a little bit about this. I get it.\u201d As well as expanding background checks to clarify that online sellers and gun shows need to be licensed, Obama also called on Congress to authorise extra spending for mental health and enforcement agents as well as new research into technology that can prevent unauthorised use of weapons by children and thieves. \u201cWe need to develop new technologies that make guns safer,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can develop technology that you can\u2019t unlock your phone unless you\u2019ve got the right fingerprint, why can\u2019t we do it for guns? If a child can\u2019t open a bottle of Aspirin, we should make sure that they can\u2019t pull the trigger on a gun.\u201d Reaction has been split about the impact of closing the existing loopholes for background checks, with the National Rifle Association insisting it would make little difference but gun control campaigners declaring it a landmark step in keeping weapons out of the wrong hands. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a system whereby dangerous people are allowed to play by a different set of rules \u2026 That doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Obama said. \u201cEverybody should have to abide by the same rules.\u201d But Obama largely skipped any detailed discussion of the measure and concentrated on a highly political effort to persuade moderate Republicans to join his wider efforts to end legislative deadlock. \u201cThe gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now but they cannot hold America hostage,\u201d he said. \u201cCongress needs to act, but folks in this room will not rest until Congress does \u2026 We can\u2019t wait.\u201d Republican presidential candidates, who have universally pledged to overturn Obama\u2019s executive orders if elected, reacted with swift outrage to the president\u2019s announcement. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee issued one of the fiercest statements, saying: \u201cIn America we believe in the constitution, not confiscations, dictatorships or Kings, and Obama\u2019s newest assault on the second amendment is a blatant, belligerent abuse of power.\u201d Huckabee, who is currently lagging far behind the polls, added: \u201cI will never bow down and surrender to Obama\u2019s unconstitutional, radical, anti-gun agenda.\u201d Even the relatively moderate Ohio governor John Kasich accused Obama of \u201cpoisoning the well\u201d by using unilateral executive action. \u201cYou don\u2019t just shove these things down their throat,\u201d he said, though welcoming the mental health aspects of the reform package. \u201cBarack Obama is obsessed with undermining the second amendment,\u201d added Florida senator Marco Rubio. \u201cHe is looking for any way possible to undermine it. He has been doing this forever. Now this executive order is just one more way to make it harder for law-abiding people to buy weapons or to be able to protect their families.\u201d Earlier this week, New Jersey governor Chris Christie called Obama \u201ca petulant child\u201d for pushing gun control while former Florida governor Jeb Bush worried that the executive action would set a \u201cquite dangerous\u201d precedent. In contrast, Democrats praised Obama\u2019s action. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton tweeted: \u201cThank you, @POTUS, for taking a crucial step forward on gun violence. Our next president has to build on that progress \u2013 not rip it away.\u201d At the outset of his emotional speech, Obama acknowledged the presence of Gabby Giffords, the congresswoman who survived a gunshot wound to the head in 2011, as well as families of gun violence victims that he enlisted directly in his call for action. He told Barden, the Sandy Hook father who lost his son in December 2012: \u201cI still remember the first time we met, the time we spent together and the conversation we had about Daniel, and that changed me that day, and my hope earnestly has been that it would change the country. \u201cFive years ago this week a sitting member of Congress and 18 others were shot at at a supermarket in Tuscon, Arizona. It wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve had to talk to the nation in response to a mass shooting, nor would it be the last. Fort Hood. Binghamton. Aurora. Oak Creek. Newtown. The Navy Yard. Santa Barbara. Charleston. San Bernardino. Too many.\u201d Some members of the audience repeated the words: \u201cToo many!\u201d Much of the speech echoed similar heartfelt calls by the president in the wake of each of these mass shootings, but the White House is hoping that by staging one of its last big set-piece events before the start of the presidential election season next month, it can jolt the American public out of the political stalemate. Obama acknowledged: \u201cIt won\u2019t happen during my presidency. But a lot of things don\u2019t happen overnight. A woman\u2019s right to vote didn\u2019t happen overnight. The liberation of African Americans didn\u2019t happen overnight. LGBT rights \u2013 that was decades\u2019 worth of work. So just because it\u2019s hard, that\u2019s no excuse not to try.\u201d He pleaded with advocates of gun control to be just as determined as influential pro-gun groups. \u201cAll of us need to demand a Congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby\u2019s lies, all of us need to stand up and protect its citizens, all of us need to demand governors and legislators and businesses do their part to make our communities safer. We need the wide majority of responsible gun owners who grieve with us every time this happens and feel like your views are not being properly represented to join with us to demand something better. \u201cAnd we need voters who want safer gun laws and who are disappointed in leaders who stand in their way to remember come election time. Some of this is just simple math. Yes, the gun lobby is loud and it is organised in defence of making it effortless for guns to be available for anybody any time. But you know what, the rest of us, we all have to be just as passionate, we have to be just as organised in defence of our kids. This is not that complicated.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
