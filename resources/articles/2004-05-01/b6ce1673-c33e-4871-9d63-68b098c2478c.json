They had to be tourists: gawping and pointing, they looked more fish than I did. I stared back down at them with mermaid eyes, then flipped defiantly and swam another lap of the roof-top pool. When I returned to the glass-bottom end that juts squarely out a metre or so over the street, I could see they were still down there - camera ready. In a flash I found my way into the photo album of a family wearing socks with sandals. That thought was distressing enough, but they were spoiling my moment. The sky still just-blue wanting to slip into violet; the softening sun still warm; the water cool and calm, mirroring my stroke; laughter and music drifting down from the terrace bar above. Perfect. I imagined that film star Cate Blanchett must have been thinking the same when she stayed here at the ultra-hip Adelphi hotel, taking a dip in the pool, looking out over the city - her city - and wondering how she could ever leave. Melbourne is, afterall, home to Australia's \u00fcbercool: Cate, Kylie, Nick Cave, Van Helsing's Hugh Jackman, Six Feet Under's Rachel Griffiths and rock gods Jet have all kept a base in the city, while fervent Melburnians Guy Pearce and Geoffrey Rush have steadfastly refused to move to Hollywood despite their phenomenal success. Most of the country's international stars were either born in this capital of the arts - such as multi-talented Barry Humphries - or given their start here, like Nicole Kidman, Natalie Imbruglia and Russell Crowe. It is no wonder they can't wait to come back. After spending two weeks in the city recently with boyfriend Olivier Martinez, even the demure Kylie couldn't help gushing 'I was so excited to be home I almost ran through immigration - Melbourne's looking amazing.' Yet there's no real bling to speak of: no sparkling harbour, no shiny monuments, no glittering postcard moments. Melbourne is a hands-on, socks off experience. Its attraction is subtle and simmering: it's underground, cutting edge, creative and so, so, hip it hurts (oh and there's coffee to kill for on every street corner). The first step to fitting in, please note socks and sandals people, is to look good - though to be fair you probably won't keep your clothes on for too long. If you're staying at the city centre Adelphi you'll be hard pushed to resist the oh-so-cool roof-top pool, while if you're at the ultra-modern, sleek Prince in the seaside suburb of St Kilda, you'll be peeling off in the spa, plunging in the pool or simply rolling about for part of the afternoon on the crisp white linen sheets. The Adelphi and the Prince both feature in Herbert Ypma's essential Hip Hotels: City, quite a coup considering the guide only includes 40 hotels in 24 destinations around the world. It's hardly worth getting dressed again as, once on the street, you're likely to be stripped down again to your underwear within minutes of seeing your first shop. The city centre has a host of goodies for High Street hags, headed by the particularly good Sportsgirl chain, and the so-called Paris End of the central Collins Street offers up the usual fare for label sluts with the likes of Versace and Louis Vuitton. But where this city comes into its own is with objects of desire found in scores of second-hand shops and new designer boutiques. Before you know it you'll be naked in a changing room, praying to the great god of silky thighs to please make the dress fit. And it's not just the kill that is satisfying, it's the chase. In Melbourne, criss-crossing the main shopping precinct - bordered by Flinders, Lonsdale, Swanston and Queen streets - is a labyrinth of arcades and tiny lanes,the closest thing to King Solomon's mines for the true aficionado, with just enough little cafes to help you rest, reflect and refresh between assaults on the boutiques. Cate loves Little Collins Street which she says is 'where all the up-and-coming young designers are'. Songstresses Kylie and Natalie Imbruglia both favour the hot haunts south of the river, especially eclectic Chapel Street and Toorak Road with its innovative local designers such as Scanlon &amp; Theodore, Bettina Liano and Alannah Hill. Natalie Imbruglia raves about the funky second-hand clothes shops on 'really cool' Greville Street nearby. One of the most important traits of high cool is not only the ability to embrace change, but to be the catalyst for it. Melbourne has an incredible capacity for reinvention and an amazing store of home-grown talent. The originality and style found in those tiny shops, is evident on a grander scale as soon as you step outside where adventurous modern architecture sits comfortably alongside the doyennes of the Victorian era. The colourful and colossal Melbourne Museum, opened in 2000, dwarfs its sober neighbour, the Royal Exhibition Centre, built in 1880; its mass of corroded steel forms a fitting home to the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art - Victoria's mini-Tate; while Federation Square, an extraordinary arts complex made of crazy geometric panels of metal, glass and stone, gleams next to neoclassical Flinders Street Station. All three are beautiful on the inside as well as the outside and house impressive collections with great innovation and flair. Of course, such courageous designs attract their critics, but even Kylie - a self-confessed 'Federation Square nay-sayer' - now declares: 'The first time I saw it I was like, \"Oh, no\". But when you drive past it that big entrance looks amazing. I'm dying to go inside and have a look.' Indeed, even dissent can be creative in Melbourne: Rachel Griffiths ran topless through the Crown Casino complex on its opening night in 1997 as a protest against its tacky architecture. As a Melburnian, she's one of a truly mixed bag, with residents originally hailing from more than 140 nations. The city has a large and influential Italian community whose traditional heart is in trendy Lygon Street, Carlton; the Greek population makes Melbourne the biggest 'Greek city' outside Greece; while the growth of the city's vibrant Vietnamese community means the second-most listed name in the phone book after 'Smith' is now 'Nguyen'. But this melting pot isn't just about the multicultural population but also the popular Aussie 'fusion' cuisine, which combines Anglo, European and Asian influences. Holly Valance says when she's away from her hometown she misses the food most: 'I'm a big restaurant buff. I miss going to even the crappiest cafes and still getting really good food and coffee. That's why Starbucks doesn't work in Melbourne - there's just brilliant coffee in every corner store.' With more than 400 restaurants in the central business district alone, Melbourne does cafe culture very well. There are streets filled with culinary pleasures: you just need to find a table outside and watch the world go by - or become one of those being watched as you take an evening stroll. Two of the best restaurant streets must be funky Brunswick St in Fitzroy or Acland St in trendy St Kilda, where the cult TV series The Secret Life of Us was filmed. At night, in Melbourne, everything is on the menu. The celebs have their favourite watering holes: Barry Humphries loves the Night Cat in Johnson Street, Fitzroy, while Russell Crowe would probably head straight for the famous live music venue, the Esplanade Hotel in St Kilda - he once played a gig there with his band 30-Odd Foot of Grunts, as captured on his Gaslight album. Cate Blanchett, on the other hand, might be found at the nearby George Public Bar. The truth is you really can't go too wrong if you just stroll down one of the main streets and take pot luck. But if you want to find one of the more elusive underground haunts, you'll need a little help. I discovered the very handy deck of 52 Bar Secrets cards - each one listing a bar or club, with a map of how to find it. This came in particularly handy while trying to find the kitsch-chic Honkytonks bar: 'proceed down a refuse-strewn, graffitied alley until you come to a white picket fence'. Less traumatic was the journey down to the groovy Mink Bar - another favourite of Cate Blanchett - in the basement of St Kilda's Prince Hotel, where I was staying. In front of me were 43 different vodkas - all kept in a freezer. Now that's what I call cool.
