Top stories Trump said supporters who harassed a Biden campaign bus \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d, after the FBI announced an investigation into the incident in Texas. \u201cThey did nothing wrong,\u201d Trump said in a tweet, \u201cbut the ANTIFA Anarchists, Rioters and Looters, who have caused so much harm and destruction in Democrat run cities, are being seriously looked at!\u201d Biden and Trump both held rallies in key swing states as American prepares for election day. Biden is currently ahead in the polls (although the race is tightening in key states), despite a manipulated video of the Democrat candidate forgetting what state he was in racking up 1.1m views before being removed. Hollywood actor Johnny Depp has lost his high-stakes libel action in the London courts against the Sun after the newspaper described him as a \u201cwife beater\u201d. In the ruling, judge Justice Nicol said: \u201cI have found that the great majority of alleged assaults of Ms Heard by Mr Depp have been proved to the civil standard.\u201d The case has seen the actor\u2019s hedonistic Hollywood lifestyle laid bare, including gargantuan monthly wine bills and blackout-inducing cocaine binges.

An overwhelming majority of Australian voters want an independent, national anti-corruption body, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll, which found 81% of respondents want an anti-corruption watchdog, and 60% want it established now rather than delayed because of the pandemic. Under pressure to explain the delay given that the government has been mulling the federal integrity body since 2018, the Coalition argued during the last parliamentary sitting it was difficult to proceed to implementation in the middle of a public health crisis. Despite the public pressure for an anti-corruption body, approval of the Morrison government\u2019s coronavirus response remains steady at 61%. Australia Australia is likely to keep suffering economic harm from \u201crepeated rounds of Chinese economic coercion\u201d and needs to find a way to reset the relationship, a former ambassador to Beijing has warned. Geoff Raby, the Australian ambassador to China from 2007 to 2011, said Australia needed China more than the other way around and argued that Australia\u2019s close relationships with the United States over the past few years to resist China\u2019s rise went against Australia\u2019s interests. In a new book published on Tuesday, Raby suggests Australia\u2019s strategy for managing the rise of China has been \u201cincremental, reactive to others\u2019 agendas, and as such, incoherent\u201d. \u201cCanberra hates this, but I start with the premise that it\u2019s an asymmetrical relationship [and] whether we like it or not, we need China more than they need us.\u201d A smoke cloud pushed into the stratosphere by last summer\u2019s bushfire crisis was three times larger than anything previously recorded globally.
