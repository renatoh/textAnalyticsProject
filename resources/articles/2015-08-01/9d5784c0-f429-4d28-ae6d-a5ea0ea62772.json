Australia\u2019s benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 and All Ordinaries indices fell more than 4% on Monday \u2013 their largest one-day drop since January 2009 \u2013 and further losses were expected on Tuesday. Traders around the world were influenced by an 8.5% drop in the value of the Shanghai Composite Index, the biggest one-day decline since 2007, prompting China\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, to declare it \u201cBlack Monday\u201d. On Tuesday, the Australian treasurer sought to reassure people worried about the market falls. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely confident, absolutely confident, that the fundamentals of the Australian economy and the global economy are still good, are still good. Without doubt, that is the situation.\u201d Hockey told the Nine network\u2019s Today Show. He said countries did not have the same \u201cfirepower\u201d \u2013 or the capacity to cut interest rates and engage in stimulatory spending \u2013 as they did at the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008, but added: \u201cIn fact there is no crisis now. It is a correction.\u201d The treasurer said China \u2013 Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner \u2013 had a plan to ensure strong economic growth. Hockey met last week with a senior Chinese economic figure who \u201creassured us, from his lips to our ears, that China would use whatever tools it has available to make sure that it grows relatively strongly this year\u201d. Hockey said despite the falls, the Chinese stockmarket was still 40% higher than it was 12 months ago \u201cand there has been a lot of flighty money in the Chinese stock market, so that\u2019s part of the equation\u201d. In an interview on 3AW, Hockey said the Chinese stock market was \u201cquite irrational\u201d. \u201cThere are going to be gyrations, there is going to be volatility, so we\u2019ve got to come back to the core business of the economy. In Australia last month 38,000 new jobs were created,\u201d he said. The same jobs figures showed the unemployment rate in Australia increased to 6.3% in July in seasonally adjusted terms. Hockey said he would travel to Turkey next week to meet with G20 finance ministers and central bank governors and \u201cthe world is coming together to deal with these sorts of issues\u201d. Last month, Hockey stood by his budget forecasts, outlined in May, for China\u2019s economic growth after the country experienced sharemarket volatility."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
