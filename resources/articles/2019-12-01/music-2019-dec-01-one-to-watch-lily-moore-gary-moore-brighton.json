It\u2019s an ode to the frustration of breakups where, actually, you still quite like your ex. \u201cI know it must sound cruel, but it\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to do for me to get over you,\u201d she adds. Fair enough. Moore is the daughter of rock star royalty \u2013 the late Thin Lizzy guitarist Gary Moore was her father \u2013 and music has always played a central role in her life. \u201cMy mum always said when I was younger, she\u2019d get worried about me if I wasn\u2019t singing,\u201d she told online mag the Line of Best Fit. Inspired by the emergence of Adele and Amy Winehouse in the late 2000s, Moore began her own career busking around Brighton, before eventually winning a competition to play at The Great Escape festival in 2015. In the years that followed, she balanced school with songwriting, releasing her first single Not That Special in February 2018, followed by an EP of the same name. After supporting James Bay and George Ezra, this year she has headlined the 100 Club in London, and released the 11-track mixtape More Moore last month. Moore\u2019s neo-soul sound and powerhouse vocals have prompted comparisons with Amy Winehouse, but the self-deprecating humour she finds when turning her formative experiences of love and loss into gutsy ballads feel distinctly her own. The More Moore mixtape is out now on Virgin EMI / Closer Recordings"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
