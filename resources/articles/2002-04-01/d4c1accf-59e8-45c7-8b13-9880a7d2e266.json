McRae admitted that he cannot grip normally with his left hand, which was potentially a critical handicap on the most twisty round of the world rally championship. However, though the finger still looks raw, 90 minutes of physiotherapy a day and additional laser treatment have enabled McRae to take control of his Ford and the rally. After three successive victories, Peugeot's drivers are threatening to run away with the championship. But the rock-strewn tracks of Cyprus's Troodos mountains suit the rugged Ford. Nevertheless, McRae has been put under pressure not just by Peugeot's Marcus Gronholm but Ford's junior drivers Markko Martin - the early leader - and Fran\u00e7ois Duval. \"It's all going according to plan at the moment,\" McRae said. \"It's just a balance between finding the speed and looking after the car. There are an awful lot of corners to get round before Sunday night.\" Peugeot are looking unusually formidable on such rough terrain, but though Gronholm is in second position, Richard Burns is suffering and admits that he does not know why he cannot match Gronholm's pace. He was ninth last night, over a minute behind McRae. \"I don't think there's anything wrong with the car, but obviously I'm not getting the most from it,\" Burns said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
