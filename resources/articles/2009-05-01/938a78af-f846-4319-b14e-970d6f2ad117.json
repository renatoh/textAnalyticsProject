His teenage narrator, Skunk, lies in a coma as she recounts the brutal events that unfold in Drummond Square. The equivalent of Lee's reclusive Boo Radley is Rick Buckley, who becomes housebound when he's beaten up. The local children give Rick the nickname \"Broken\" and spread rumours that he's a murderer. But where Lee's novel leads to redemption, Clay's slides into melodrama, only partially saved by its sharp writing \u2013 Broken's father, for instance, is reduced to listening to \"the ghost of his son scrape around in the kitchen\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
