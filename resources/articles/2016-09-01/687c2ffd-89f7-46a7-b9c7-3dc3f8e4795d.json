In his leader\u2019s speech in Brighton on Tuesday, Farron will say the party needs to be honest about the costs of making social care fully government-funded. \u201cIf the only way to fund a health service that meets the needs of everyone is to raise taxes, Liberal Democrats will raise taxes,\u201d he will say, promising to campaign to transform the NHS into the National Health and Care Service. \u201cFor years, politicians have chosen to paper over the cracks rather than come clean about what it will really take \u2013 what it will really cost \u2013 not just to keep the NHS afloat but to give people the care and the treatment that they deserve. \u201cIf the great Liberal William Beveridge [1879-1963] had written his blueprint today, when people are living to the ages they are now, there is no doubt he would have proposed a National Health and Care Service.\u201d The party insists it believes there is enough affection for the NHS for British people to feel positive about paying more taxes, not normally seen as an election-winning strategy. The Lib Dem leader will talk about his own grandfather\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease, saying the first home he was put in was \u201cdespicable\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough terrible old people\u2019s homes,\u201d he will say. \u201cIt\u2019s not civilised to let people slip through the net. It\u2019s not civilised towards the people who love those people, who go out of their way to try and make their lives easier when everything else is making their lives harder. It\u2019s not civilised and it\u2019s not good enough.\u201d Earlier in the week Lib Dem health spokesman Norman Lamb told the conference the government should consider moulding national insurance into a ringfenced NHS and social care tax, to make it easier to increase the amount paid with public support. An expert panel \u2013 which the party will call its Beveridge commission \u2013 will report back to the party in six months on the costs, but Lamb suggested the tax could mean an increase of a \u201can extra penny in the pound\u201d. Farron will say the Lib Dems \u201cwill not join the ranks of those politicians who are too scared of losing votes to face up to what really needs to be done\u201d. \u201cWe will go to the British people with the results of our Beveridge commission and we will offer a new deal for health and social care, honest about the cost, bold about the solution.\u201d Earlier on Monday, Lamb announced cross-party support for a commission into the NHS funding crisis, backed by Labour MP and former leadership contender Liz Kendall, and Tory MP Dan Poulter, a former gynaecologist. Speaking to the Lib Dem conference in Brighton, Kendall said it would be politically difficult to dedicate a new tax to the NHS. \u201cIt\u2019s very tough for anybody in any party to say any tax should go up,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reality, however passionately we might think this is the right solution, but certainly when Labour was in government and we did the penny on NI [national insurance] for the NHS, it was a semi-hypothecation to say it\u2019s going to go on this specifically. It\u2019s an important option.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
