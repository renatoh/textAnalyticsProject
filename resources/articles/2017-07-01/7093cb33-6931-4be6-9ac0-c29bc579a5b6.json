The defence industry minister said Australia could export \u201call sorts of arms\u201d to increase jobs, including vessels, offshore patrol vessels, remote warfare systems, surveillance, sonar, radar and potentially frigates. \u201cWe are doing some of that,\u201d Pyne told the ABC. \u201cMy ambition is to enormously increase that capacity and send a lot more weapons overseas to appropriate countries and appropriate places of course. \u201cWe simply wouldn\u2019t do so willy-nilly. We have a particular process for that.\u201d But Pyne\u2019s plans were slammed by World Vision Australia chief advocate Tim Costello, saying the government had cut humanitarian aid which saved lives while discussing the merits of becoming a major weapons manufacturer and exporter. \u201cThe government says this is an export and investment opportunity, but we would be exporting death and profiting from bloodshed,\u201d Costello said. \u201cIs that what we want Australia to be known for? \u201cThere is only one purpose in making a weapon and that is to kill someone with it. \u201cDo we really want that to be what people think of when they see the brand \u2018made in Australia\u2019?\u201d Costello said the Syrian war \u2013 in its seventh year \u2013 could not have lasted for more than a year without armaments profiteering. As a result, there had been more than 300,000 people killed, including thousands of children, 13.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, 6.3 million people internally displaced and five million people turned into refugees. \u201cDefence industry minister Christopher Pyne says he wants Australia to become a major arms exporter on par with Britain, France and Germany and use exports to \u2018cement relationships\u2019 with countries in volatile regions such as the Middle East. \u201cIs it really a good idea to sell weapons in a volatile region? \u201cMinister Pyne also says we would only sell weapons to \u2018appropriate countries\u2019, and would not export weapons \u2018willy-nilly\u2019, as though weapons never fall into the wrong hands.\u201d Pyne said an expanded arms industry could create jobs and investment in Australia given the country already had skilled workers, an advanced manufacturing base and the technological capability. He said the expansion could add to the $50bn submarine contract awarded to French shipbuilder DCNS. Pyne said while Australia needed the French company to help with some expertise, the submarines would be built in Australia. Pyne said by the end of the current contracts, Australia would have built 12 submarines, 12 offshore patrol vessels, nine frigates and 21 patrol vessels for the Pacific. He said current contracts are worth $200bn over a decade. \u201cWe have completely reenergised, in a renaissance for ship-building industry in Australia, and they were decisions being made by this government,\u201d he said. \u201cAs part of that massive buildup of capability in the defence industry, we then need to look at exporting that capability because it brings treasure, investment and jobs to our economy here in Australia.\u201d Pyne said Australia could create a weapons export industry if the country overcame its reflexive response that it could not be done. \u201cWhat we have to overcome, with great respect, is that instantaneous and reflexive response that Australians sometimes have that we can\u2019t do it here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do it here, we are a great manufacturing nation and a great export nation.\u201d On Monday, Malcolm Turnbull will announce plans to make it easier for defence to back up police in domestic terrorist incidents. The move comes following a review, for the first time since 2005, of domestic counter-terrorism incidents. Pyne said the immediate responders to domestic terrorist incidents were always police but defence officers could be embedded in police forces and defence could also provide training in counter-terrorism. The government plans to change the law that requires state and territory governments to exhaust their capacity to respond to domestic terror events before they can ask for military help. The plan follows a coronial report into the Lindt cafe siege, which found police should have stormed the cafe as soon as Man Haron Monis began shooting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
