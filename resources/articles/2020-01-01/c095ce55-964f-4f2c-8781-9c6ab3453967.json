Why are the Americans so concerned? To put it bluntly, the White House believes the Chinese state will use Huawei to help it spy. Officials in Washington believe the company poses a security risk because the Chinese government will make the firm engineer backdoors in its technology, through which information could be accessed by Beijing. Donald Trump has banned US companies from sharing technology with Huawei and has been putting pressure on other nations to follow his lead. In the UK\u2019s case, Washington says that allowing Huawei to manufacture parts of the 5G network infrastructure will risk exposing state secrets to Chinese spies. What is the British view? While they have accepted there is some risk in working with Huawei, the UK\u2019s security services do not believe it to be unmanageable. Some security concerns have been raised but the intelligences agencies have not linked them to Chinese state influence. The UK government has agreed in principle to allow Huawei to be involved in building \u201cnon-core\u201d parts of the UK\u2019s 5G network. With a final decision expected within weeks, the head of MI5 had recently said he was confident the US-UK intelligence-sharing relationship would not be affected if London gave Huawei the nod. What do Huawei say? Huawei insists it has never been asked to build any backdoor into its technology by the Chinese government and has offered to sign a \u201cno spy agreement\u201d with countries adopting it. Amid concerns that the Chinese government could force Huawei\u2019s hand, the firm\u2019s former chairman Liang Hua said last May there were \u201cno laws requiring the companies to collect intelligence from foreign governments\u201d. Is there more at play here? Huawei certainly think so. During Trump\u2019s presidency, the trade rivalry between the US and China has intensified and the firm believes the White House is simply using it as a weapon in that larger fight. Huawei\u2019s chairman, Eric Xu, has said the US government was in the midst of a \u201cstrategic and long-term\u201d campaign against it. A senior Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, is fighting extradition from Canada to the US where she faces fraud charges."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
