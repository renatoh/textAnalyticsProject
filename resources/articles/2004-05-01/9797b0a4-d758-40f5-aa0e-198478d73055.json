I now have the capital and I feel I can offer an awful lot to Liverpool.\" The Garston-born construction magnate may have to build bridges with the chairman David Moores before his dream becomes a reality. Yet, as Morgan's offer to inject up to \u00a373m into Anfield's coffers is discussed at a board meeting today, public opinion is swinging inexorably away from the Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra's alternative proposal. Liverpool supporters are falling in behind one of their own. Even as he sat in the plush boardroom of the Warrington hotel in which he has a sizeable stake, it was easy to see why. Morgan, like Moores, lives and breathes Liverpool. His complaints at the current regime are issued from the heart, his frustration painfully clear at the sight of a club he four times saw dominate Europe languishing an inexcusable 28 points from the pinnacle. Thaksin may struggle to identify five Liverpool players; Morgan could rattle off the youth team in his sleep. \"The priority is clearly improvement on the playing side,\" he said, tapping a copy of the summary of the rights and share issues he hopes will revive the club after a largely demoralising campaign. The scheme could leave him with anything from a 5% to 35% stake in Liverpool, depending upon whether either issue is fully taken up. \"Performances this season have been unacceptable and we can't have that again. We have to be fighting for the Premiership title next year.\" The Kop would echo those sentiments. Liverpool were untouchable when Morgan was taking his first steps towards amassing a fortune, some of which he hopes to pour into Anfield, though his love for the club developed during a nomadic childhood spent following his father's work. The RAF fitter turned mechanic took the Morgan family from Liverpool to north Wales, with young Steve attending nine schools. \"When you are new kid at school, particularly in Liverpool, everybody wants to see how tough you are,\" he once admitted. \"I used to dread the first week because you would have three or four fights just to get in the right pecking order.\" That hardened him up and may have attributed to the workaholic attitude which saw him take up two paper rounds as a 14-year-old, as well as a small plant hire business. There were seven O-levels, though he changed schools to do his A-levels, fell out with the teachers and left during the first term. That took him to building site, via a two-year diploma course at what was Liverpool Polytechnic. Then, at 21, he borrowed \u00a35,000 from his father, drew up plans on the kitchen table in his Rhyl bungalow and started up as a civil engineering sub-contractor working on roads and sewage plants. His first wife, Pam, typed up all the tenders for the newly formed Redrow Homes while Morgan worked 18 hours a day, seven days a week before, after eight years, turning his attentions to the higher margins available in housebuilding. He dug the foundations of the company's first property in 1982; 18 years later he stepped down as chairman of the Deeside-based firm and sold the bulk of his shares for almost \u00a3240m. Now with an estimated fortune of \u00a3312m, he retains a \u00a340m stake in Redrow along with a \u00a343m share in the leisure group De Vere, part of a \u00a350m leisure complex in Mallorca and the estate where he lives in Jersey. He is currently building a house near Chester with the intention to relocate. He returns up to 25 times a season to watch the current Liverpool team from the directors' box. Not that money has gone to his head. This is still a man who readily admits to arguing over the price of a can of Coke if he feels he is being ripped off, and who still travels economy when visiting France. That hardly suggests an Abramovich-style open-chequebook approach. \"Simply spending money does not guarantee success,\" he said yesterday. \"I would like to think we can return to the old culture of the club. \"If we do that, I believe our top players will want to stay and new top players will want to come and help take this club back to where I -and all our fans - consider to be our rightful spot. Back to No1. \"I am doing this because I care. As a kid I'd cry over bad results. Now I feel the time's right to give more time to my life's passion.\" The contender Steve Morgan Born in Garston, Liverpool. Aged 51. Lives in Jersey.
