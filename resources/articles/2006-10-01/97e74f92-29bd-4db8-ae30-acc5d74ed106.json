Before long it grew into a tiny tree. She put stones around it to stop her dad weeding it away. In time the little girl and the tiny tree grew bigger and bigger. The girl was busy with school and friends and going away to college. She neglected the tree but still it grew. Her dad wanted to cut it down to stop it undermining the foundations but she would never let him. One day he phoned her at college to tell her that there were two conkers growing on the tree. She kept those conkers in a little box. She has them still. The tree got big and strong. Dad lopped off the top every now and again. \"A horse chestnut in the middle of an estate - it's ridiculous!\" One day this summer, a little boy climbed the tree and smiled down at his mother. The little girl took a photo. Marian Edwards Perfect day: Lost and loving it My husband has an early appointment in Surrey. We all go with him, intending to spend the rest of the day together. Instead of waiting in the car, we discover we are on the edge of a wooded walk. Mum and four little ones traipse off into this Constable idyll. The dappled colours, the flickering shafts of sunlight, a fairytale lake with swans, children poking and sifting and smelling and smiling. Simple pleasures! We finally turn around and head back. And suddenly the path seems unfamiliar. How can we be lost? We are in the suburbs of Surrey! I have no idea where our car is. People stare and shake their heads as I try to describe where we left it. I leave a barely audible message on my husband's phone, I am laughing so much. How can I have managed to get myself and my children lost so easily? We did get back, eventually. I especially remember that summer-encrusted walk at the beginning, with all my little ones running around me. One of my children has gone now. He died of leukaemia. I will never again be able to walk in a wood with all four of them. Sara Lewandowski We love to eat Sunday sandwiches Ingredients (for one round) Two thin slices of white bread, freshly cut from a crusty sandwich loaf Slightly salted Danish butter Chopped leaves from a round lettuce Grated mature cheddar cheese Sliced spring onions Salt Auntie and her youngest visited us on alternate Sundays from Woodford Green. We visited them on the Sundays between. For tea we used to give them lettuce, cheese and onion sandwiches; simple and delicious. Mum was always being asked what made them so good. In fact it was usually Dad who made them. He had the knack of getting the balance just right. There was no secret ingredient, just the simplest and best produce, not so difficult in the 50s when food was comparatively plain and unadulterated. To assemble the sandwich, generously spread the butter on the bread. On one slice, pile the lettuce, the cheese and finally the onion. Sprinkle lightly with salt and top with the second slice. Cut into dainty triangles. Perfect. I make them still. Barbara Crawford We'd love to hear your stories We will pay \u00a375 for every Playlist, Perfect Day, Snapshot or We Love to Eat we publish.
