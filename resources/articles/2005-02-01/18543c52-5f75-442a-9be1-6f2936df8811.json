But the assertion that the British public is learning not to stigmatise people living with HIV (Report, January 31) is not entirely accurate. Outsider Status, a recent report by the National Aids Trust, demonstrated that gay men and Africans living with HIV in the UK still experience high daily levels of discrimination which can cause stress, isolation and ill health. We can only hope that the supportive response to Chris Smith by Tony Blair and the media will set an example that will prove to be a milestone in the fight against HIV-related stigma and discrimination in the UK. Ruth Runciman Chair, National Aids Trust Chris Smith's brave admission stands in stark contrast to the record of some MPs. In January 2004 Ann Winterton, Conservative MP for Congleton, put forward an early day motion on sexual health education which stated that \"this house notes the statement from Dr Edward Green that the spread of the HIV virus is a behavioural problem\". For too long this sort of attitude has stigmatised any proper debate about living with the virus and led to many people suffering in silence or, worse still, not taking a test. Since coming out as the first openly gay MP 20 years ago, Smith has seen his majority in Islington South and Finsbury substantially increase and were he to be stand again I have no doubt he would be re-elected. In contrast, Ann Winterton has been sacked from the frontbench and had the whip withdrawn for making ill-judged remarks. Nicholas Milton Sandbach, Cheshire There is no doubt that Chris Smith's announcement is an important contribution to encourage people to have positive lives. The time lag highlights the difficulty of talking about the HIV status for someone as well-respected as Smith who has been clear and open about his private life. It seems to point out that there is still an implicit stigma around the issue. Furthermore, it suggests that stigma is not only the problem of developing countries where the silence of high-profile politicians is seen as unhelpful. Clearly, the time lag in Smith's situation shows that there is a gap between the political rhetoric of advocating openness in HIV discussions and the constraints perceived by individuals to talk about their private lives in particular social contexts.
