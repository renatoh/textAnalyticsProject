And not only does it share the skeleton of a plot with the Sheffield strippers - in this case a motley crew of poverty-stricken pals form a handball team hoping it will prove their ticket to Europe (the championships are in Germany) - but it also has the same curious tonal mix: chirpy with a squeeze of suicidal. Machan comes dripping with plaudits from its world tour of film festivals, and is buoyed up on hype. But it's not a disappointment: this is Slumdog sans songs, but with real soul. It's funny, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
