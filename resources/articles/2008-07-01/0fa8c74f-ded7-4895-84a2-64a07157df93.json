Hill's second novel is set, like her first, in a Surrey village in the 1950s. Having inadvertently killed one of his more tiresome parishioners in the earlier book, Oughterard finds himself blackmailed by unfrocked cleric Nicholas Ingaza into storing stolen works of art, and having to fend off novelist and amateur sleuth Maud Tubbly Pole, who wants him to help her solve the murder case. The two animals provide a gloss on the proceedings and occasionally help out with the action. Quite why this series should be charming, astringent and witty, instead of emetically twee, I am not sure, but it is entirely delightful. Death on a Branch Line, by Andrew Martin (Faber, \u00a310.99) The fifth in Martin's Jim Stringer series is set in 1911 and finds the stoker-turned-railway detective with just 48 hours to solve a murder not yet committed and to find out whether the local squire's son, convicted of parricide, is actually guilty. Added to which, there may be a German plot afoot to steal the British army's mobilisation plans, and Stringer is supposed to be taking his wife Lydia on holiday. Deciding to mix business with pleasure, they travel to the sleepy Yorkshire village where the murder took place. The Childers/Buchan-type stuff is not as successful as the rest of the plot and feels somewhat under-engineered, but the period detail is wonderful, the resourceful Stringer and the strong-minded Lydia are appealing characters, and the story builds up a good head of steam early on and rattles along nicely to a satisfying conclusion. City of the Sun, by David Levien (Bantam Press, \u00a310) This assured debut from screenwriter Levien begins with the disappearance of 12-year-old Jamie Gabriel from a comfortable Indianapolis suburb. It causes barely a ripple in the local police department. Fourteen months later, with no progress made, desperate parents Paul and Carol contact ex-cop PI Frank Behr, who starts digging and discovers that an apparently respectable property tycoon has a profitable sideline supplying children for wealthy perverts. Although the two main male characters are more fully rounded than Carol, who comes across as a standard-issue grieving midwestern mom, the best thing about this high-gloss, high-concept thriller is that it is actually a proper, well-written book, not merely a treatment in disguise, which delivers on its initial promise and packs an unexpectedly hefty emotional punch. Broken, by Karin Fossum, translated by Charlotte Barslund (Harvill Secker, \u00a312.99) This standalone novel, which does not feature Norwegian writer Fossum's regular protagonist, Inspector Sejer, is a departure from the norm in more ways than one. A writer writing about a writer writing does not bode well for any novel, crime or otherwise, especially when the writer being written about has a production line of characters queueing outside her house, waiting to be fictionally rendered. Losing patience, one of them breaks into her bedroom and convinces her that his need is the most urgent. As the story progresses, he tries to wrest control of the plot from its author, but as he is cowed by others and has difficulty expressing himself, it's a rather one-sided conflict, with no real sense of tension. Broken is an ambitious, tricksy, and ultimately frustrating book. It never seems to get properly under way, as the creepy Highsmithian atmospherics and the potentially fascinating exploration of the boundaries of life, art and personal responsibility are undercut by intrusive symbolism and an almost perversely stilted translation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
