Plans for the first Meditative Prom were revealed in the programme announcement of the summer festival, which is 90% classical but will this year have east-coast hip-hop and the Clangers as alternative options. The late-night Meditative Prom at the Royal Albert Hall will have short pieces of music \u201cto calm the mind and nourish the soul,\u201d said the schedulers. \u201cI still don\u2019t know whether we can achieve this, but I have the thought it would be lovely to do the whole concert in the dark,\u201d said David Pickard, the BBC Proms director. \u201cWe did think about calling it the Mindfulness Prom, but we thought maybe that was a statement too far. I cannot make any claims at all that you will come out of it feeling a new person and that your life will be changed forever, but there\u2019s an element, I hope, that it will have an effect on wellbeing \u2026 I hope that\u2019s not too pretentious or pompous to say.\u201d The Prom is a collaboration with the Radio 3 team who produce the popular In Tune Mixtape programmes, with music chosen to fit in with themes or moods. Pickard said the music could be Schubert or Arvo P\u00e4rt, but he hoped there would be a way of not telling the audience what they would be listening to in advance. \u201cOur concert programming can get a little formulaic sometimes. This is an opportunity to put it together in a different way, which is by mood rather than composer.\u201d For many years the festival has staged Proms that are a long way from its classical foundations. There was an urban music Prom in 2013 and a Pete Tong-hosted dance Prom in 2015. This year, Prom 64 will be hip-hop. Led by Jules Buckley and the Heritage Orchestra, it will include breakdancing, graffiti art, MCing and DJing. Jonny Greenwood, the Radiohead guitarist and film score composer, will be a highlight of new music, premiering a violin concerto called Horror Vacui, in which a solo violin will be accompanied by 68 strings \u201cto simulate electronic music while being entirely acoustic,\u201d said Pickard. After previous trips out of London to Hull and Lincoln, the furthest the Proms will travel this year will be south of the Thames, to Battersea Arts Centre; and to the Holy Sepulchre church in the City. The church was where the conductor and composer Henry Wood, the founder of the Proms, learned to play the organ as a teenager, and the planned Prom there will be one of a number of events celebrating the 150th anniversary of his birth. Other anniversaries being marked include 50 years since Apollo 11 landed on the moon. There will be a sci-fi film music Prom and a CBeebies Prom offering families \u201cthe chance to travel through time and space\u201d and encounter the Clangers. The 200th anniversary of Queen Victoria\u2019s birth will be marked at a Prom where Stephen Hough will play Victoria\u2019s actual piano, the first time it will be played outside Buckingham Palace. There will also be songs written by Prince Albert. \u201cThey are actually lovely, I kid you not,\u201d said Pickard. \u201cThey are really beautifully crafted, very much in the flavour of Schubert and Schumann. They are great \u2026 and the public will decide for themselves.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
