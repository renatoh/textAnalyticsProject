The policy is part of a five-point plan which will be outlined by the party\u2019s leader Nick Clegg during a visit to a school in the key Lib Dem marginal seat of St Austell and Newquay, Cornwall, on Monday. A party spokesperson said that, while it was reasonable for politicians to have a say in the core national curriculum, the Lib Dems wanted to prevent a repeat of the \u201cfarcical situation\u201d that existed when Michael Gove was education secretary. Earlier this month, Nick Clegg likened the Department for Education under Gove to political parody show The Thick of It, saying the former education secretary was known to keep a handwritten list of medieval monarchs that he believed schoolchildren should be required to learn. A friend of Gove\u2019s described the Lib Dem leader\u2019s comments as about \u201cas honest as Clegg\u2019s policy on tuition fees\u201d. \u201cGove frequently fought against Clegg\u2019s ludicrous whims being imposed on schools,\u201d he added. The proposed independent body would be made up of a board of education and subject-specific experts who would design the curriculum and set exam standards in each subject, keeping \u201cthe politics out of the classroom\u201d. A party spokesperson said that the plan was about stopping micromanagement by ministers and that only a small amount of funding for administration costs would be needed to establish the body, which would be known as the Educational Standards Authority. \u201cThere are huge amounts of stuff that we did in government that we, the Liberal Democrats, are extremely proud of,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cHowever, there are certain things which \u2026 particularly Michael Gove did which we think were unhelpful and which we can dramatically improve by ensuring that all pupils are taught by qualified teachers, [and] that the curriculum is set by people who are qualified to do so.\u201d A Conservative party spokesman said that decisions about what was in the curriculum should lie in the hands of those \u201cwho can be held to account by parents at the ballot box \u2013 not unelected bureaucrats as proposed by the Lib Dems\u201d. \u201cThe Lib Dems can\u2019t run on their record and run away from it at the same time. They signed up to the new national curriculum, now they want to rewrite it all over again. They voted for extending academy freedoms over the curriculum, now they want to scrap them.\u201d The four other measures which the Liberal Democrat leader will highlight on Monday are: Protecting per-pupil education spending in real terms over the next parliament and increasing the education budget as a whole. Guaranteeing that all teachers in state-funded schools will be fully qualified or working towards qualified teacher status (QTS) by September 2016. Establishing a Royal College of Teachers to oversee QTS and professional development. Establishing a national leadership Institute to promote high-quality leadership in schools in the most deprived areas. Free schools and academy schools are currently able to employ teachers who have not done any formal teacher training, a situation favoured by Gove as giving freedom to heads to recruit teachers with a wider set of skills. Announcing the measures, Clegg is expected to highlight his party\u2019s plans to protect education spending for those aged between two and 19 in real terms until 2017-18, from which point the Lib Dems would increase spending in line with economic growth. The party said its plans involved \u00a32.5bn more investment in education by 2020 than Labour and \u00a35bn more than the Conservatives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
