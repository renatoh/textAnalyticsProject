He did not have a phone, and so used a pen and paper for addresses and numbers he needed to remember. \u201cHe was telling me that he has been sleeping rough and he was basically asking for some help,\u201d Yussuf said. The encounter that followed, which Yussuf went on to outline in a series of Twitter posts, showed how and why people \u201cslip through the cracks\u201d, he said. The man asked to borrow Yussuf\u2019s phone. Yussuf called a crisis hotline on his behalf, and was told to contact Launch Housing, a service in inner Melbourne. On calling them, he was told the man was ineligible for a bed because he was already registered to receive services in WA. \u201cThey said he had housing in WA \u2018so we can\u2019t help you even though you\u2019re in Melbourne,\u2019\u201d Yussuf said. \u201cThey were like, \u2018sorry we can\u2019t help you\u2019, which I just found very strange. \u201cHe\u2019s been sleeping rough since last Friday and if he doesn\u2019t find any housing he\u2019ll be rough sleeping until Friday week.\u201d Demand for emergency housing far outstrips supply, a fact regularly lamented by service agencies, which say they are \u201cchronically underfunded\u201d. About 235 people are turned away from agencies across Australia each day, figures show. On average, about 90 are from Victoria. In inner Melbourne alone, there are about 300 people sleeping on the streets each night. \u201cThe heartbreaking reality is that Victoria is in a housing crisis, and it\u2019s only getting worse,\u201d said Andrew D\u2019Arcy, a general manager at Launch Housing. He said the organisation was forced to prioritise \u201cpeople with the highest level of need, because there is not enough accommodation to meet demand\u201d. \u201cWe believe that everyone deserves a safe, secure, affordable home, so it\u2019s incredibly challenging to have to turn so many people away,\u201d he said. The plight of people experiencing homelessness has been highlighted after the death of 25-year-old Courtney Herron, who was sleeping rough when she was allegedly killed. Henry Richard Hammond, 27, has been charged with her murder. This week, a report from housing thinktank Ahuri showed that homelessness was increasingly concentrated in the capital cities, particularly Melbourne and Sydney. After the man was rejected by the shelter, Yussuf helped him call his Centrelink social worker. He was told he would not be able to access an emergency crisis payment until the following week. There are strict rules around crisis payments, including that a person can receive a maximum of two over 12 months. Yussuf said the social worker did organise for the man to find a bed at another service in inner Melbourne, although he would have to wait another 24 hours. \u201cHe was sleeping in some park,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if he got the emergency crisis payment he could have at least gone for some short-time housing through a motel or something like that. \u201cBecause he couldn\u2019t, he had to find somewhere else to go, through this whole confusing wormhole.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
