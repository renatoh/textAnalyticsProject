But as the frontrunner continues to struggle with the fallout from the Guardian\u2019s revelations of a late night row with his girlfriend, coupled with some distinctly shaky interviews, questions are being asked about whether the once-seemingly unstoppable PR campaign behind Johnson is faltering, and whether the normally loquacious MP is truly \u201cmatch fit\u201d for the type of grillings expected in a race like this. \u201cI think at this point that you might actually be a bit worried from a public relations point of view that your candidate is not quite singing the tune you need him to,\u201d said one expert on media communications who has also worked alongside Johnson in the past. \u201cHe seems tired, and I think possibly that one of the problems here is that he is being over-coached. I suspect one part of his team are saying \u2018he needs to be himself\u2019 while others are saying that he needs to come across as a serious figure who cares about the future.\u201d If such a division exists, the latter camp is likely to include Lynton Crosby, the Australian political strategist who was central in 2008 and 2012 to Johnson\u2019s election and re-election as mayor of London. However, since his involvement in the Tories\u2019 disastrous 2017 general election campaign there have been questions about whether Crosby is \u2013 as put by the advertising and PR figure Tim Bell \u2013 a \u201cone trick pony\u201d. Famously a proponent of \u201cscraping the barnacles off the boat\u201d \u2013 his phrase referring to a relentless focus on core messages \u2013 Crosby couldn\u2019t help May when she ran into trouble, or negotiate the chill winds now being experienced by Johnson. Then there has been the continuing, and to some surprising, tough ride given to Johnson by sections of a normally supportive Tory Press, which includes the Telegraph, the title from which he has earned a \u00a3275,000 salary as a columnist. On Tuesday, the paper splashed with the headline \u201cBoris tries to keep the show on the road\u201d as it and other titles all ran front-page pictures of the photograph of him and his partner Carrie Symonds released by Johnson\u2019s campaign team as part of a PR strategy. Perhaps more significantly, the Daily Mail carried a front-page display for a Jan Moir column titled: \u201cBoris and the Mills &amp; Boon scene that takes us all for fools.\u201d Rather than put unanswered questions about the altercation to bed, new ones have arisen about the circumstances of the release of the image, which came without bylines or dates. If the intention was to ensure that they were widely disseminated, then the choice of releasing them in the first instance to the Mail Online seems a peculiar one. The Guardian understands that there was an in-house debate at the Mail about whether they could be taken by the newspaper\u2019s print edition. The round of broadcast interviews \u2013 including one in which Johnson sparked ridicule and suspicion about the veracity of his claim to relax by making models of buses with wooden crates \u2013 has been watched with incredulity by political communications experts. Lord Wood of Anfield, the Labour peer and political strategist, said that Johnson\u2019s interview with the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg broadcast on Monday night made him immediately question his \u201cmatch fitness\u201d. \u201cHe seems convinced that his path to No 10 is assured if he says nothing of interest and lets the party machine and arithmetic do its work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut saying nothing for reasons of discipline has tipped over into looking like he has nothing to say. This is a massive problem for a frontrunner.\u201d Wood suggests that a campaign full of \u201cbons mots and memorable phrases\u201d would have been much more effective at keeping unwelcome scrutiny away from Johnson\u2019s door. Instead, a seeming reluctance to stand up and fight might be providing uncomfortable reminders of May to the Tory faithful. At the end of the day, though, it is that fractionally small cohort of the population who ultimately matter. If this is an audience of voters who have been primed for some time to distrust mainstream media narratives and view the Guardian and BBC as hostile leftwing entities then, for all his campaign\u2019s missteps, the negative publicity surrounding Johnson might yet reinforce narratives of persecution by a liberal elite. \u2022 Additional reporting by Jim Waterson"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
