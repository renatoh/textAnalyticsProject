The actor unleashed a torrent of anger with an Italian magazine interview in which she called the activities of the Red Brigades \"enthralling and passionate\". Ardant, 59, said she admired Renato Curcio, who helped to found the group, for having stuck to his principles unlike many leaders of the 1968 student revolt in France: \"He didn't become a businessman.\" Ardant, who has more than 60 film and TV dramas to her credit, is due in Venice next week for her latest, Italian-language film, L'Ora Punta. But Giancarlo Galan, of Silvio Berlusconi's party and governor of the region that includes Venice, said \"it would really be appreciated if she did us the favour of not coming\". A front page editorial of the daily Corriere della Sera questioned whether it was \"passionately enthralling to kill innocent people, sow suffering and grief, [and] spread terror\". The Red Brigades' most notorious operation was the kidnapping and murder of a former prime minister, Aldo Moro, in 1978. Unlike other late-60s urban guerrilla movements, it remains a living presence. A reborn Red Brigades movement has killed two government advisers and a police officer since 1999. Earlier this year, 15 alleged members were arrested. Actor-director Michele Placido, who has worked with Ardant, said she was representative of a French cultural elite \"that reads the history of others blinded by passion\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
