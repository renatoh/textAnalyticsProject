Some years ago, a very enthusiastic cleaning lady took all my books out to dust them while we were away and put them back in such a strange order I've never been able to find anything since. But the shelves make a very good place to display pictures. There's a photograph that I took of my son Adam being given a lift on the back of the great Polish poet Zbigniew Herbert. I used to do a lot of climbing, and there are an awful lot of pictures of, now dead alas, climbers. There's an etching by Leonard Baskin, given to me by Ted Hughes after Sylvia Plath died, which she used to keep in her living room . And there's a wonderful photograph that was given to me by an American friend, of Picasso sitting as if he's got his arms resting on the table; what look like his fingers are, in fact, baguettes. I have terrible back problems, so I have this enormous chair, which is extremely comfortable. Behind the chair, there's a wonderful Sepik river woven head from Papua New Guinea. I had a neighbour who was about 80 when I was about 40, who sold it to me for the price he paid for it, which was very little, and I've had it in my study ever since. It's a fairly stern object and it encourages me to work \u2014 not that it succeeds much these days, but I love it. I find it almost impossible to work anywhere else. It's like being in some kind of nest. We go to a house in Italy in the summer and I can never work there because I'm not surrounded by all my stuff. I used to try and be up here by 10 in the morning, but it's rubbish what they say about old people needing less sleep; I seem to need more. Having been very active when I was young, the only thing I can do now is swim and I swim all the year round in the ponds on Hampstead Heath. Because I walk with great difficulty, it tends to take the whole morning, but I try to be working by midday. I then waste a lot of time with emails and stuff . If it's going well, I work through till eight or so. If it's not, I play poker online."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
