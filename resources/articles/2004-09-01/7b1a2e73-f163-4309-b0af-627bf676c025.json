Thomas \"Inspector Clusoe\" Levet has almost rounded off his Ryder Cup debut with a hole-in-one, but sadly the ball finished about a foot short of the hole. His oponent Fred Funk also played a spectacular tee-shot to the 12th, so Levet remains one up. Meanwhile, some people are never happy, and Niall Lambert is one of those people: \"Do you only have a photo taken over the door of a pub toilet cubicle?\" Afraid so. USA 7.5 - 12.5 EUROPE (Clarke halved with Love) A terrific match ends with the right result, though Clarke will feel he should have won after missing a putt from six feet for the victory. He can't complain too much, as he was two down with three to play. It edges Europe ever nearer to the golden total of 14.5. USA 8.5 - 12.5 EUROPE (Campbell beat Donald 5&amp;3) The results are flying in now. Chad Campbell has beaten Donald surprisingly comfortably, but it doesn't look like it will matter. One up, Lee Westwood is venturing up the 18th as I write with the possibility of putting Europe only half a point from retaining the trophy. Is it written in the stars that Monty, who is one up after winning the 16th, will hole the match-sealing putt? It's certainly possibility the way events are developing. 9.25pm: Monty has knocked his putt right bang in the middle of the hole to halve the 17th, and send himself to the last, one up. Destiny is in his hands. Well, it is if Lee Westwood hangs on to his lead. The end is nigh. Simon Rake says, bewilderingly: \"Much as I love golf, and believe me I do, it does have certain longeurs does it not, in the meantime, could I persuade you to lend your considerable powers of persuasion to the support of my campaign to reintroduce the doffing of one's hat to those (particularly the ladeez) one meets on country walks. My doffs today, while climbing an Alp, resulted merely in some bemused grins! Lets put doffing back on the map.\" USA 8.5 - 13.5 EUROPE (Westwood beat Perry 1 up) A tremendous effort from Lee Westwood means Europe are just a point from victory. \"The Ryder Cup's coming home\" are the chants from, I think, the European contingent of the crowd. Who is the man to take that point? Well it has to be Colin Montgomerie, doesn't it? General Monty has just launched his ball to the back of the green. If he can halve this hole, Europe are the winners. My word. 9.32pm: \"Mon-tee, Mon-tee, Mon-tee, Mon-tee\" cry the fans as the silver-haired maestro strides to the green... 9.34pm: Mon-tee plays a magnificent long putt to within four feet of the hole. His enormous grin tells the world that this is his moment. Toms needs to make a four to force Monty to putt for the Cup. 9.35pm: Toms holes his putt. This is the biggest moment of Monty's career. He has a four-footer for the Ryder Cup... EUROPE WIN THE RYDER CUP USA 8.5 - EUROPE 14.5 (Montgomerie beat Toms 1 up) He's done it - was there really any doubt? The ball sails into the hole, Monty lifts his arms into the air, and Europe have won the Ryder Cup. The celebrations are quieter than they were in 2002 or 1999, but they mean just as much. In a sporting gesture, Hal Sutton approached Monty to tell him the best team had won. It certainly has. With several players still on the course, things could get even better for Europe. USA 8.5 - 15.5 EUROPE (Poulter beat Riley 3&amp;2) The one man who hadn't really contributed anything to Europe's cause until today, Ian Poulter, has just won his singles match against Chris Riley. 9.45pm: The players who have finished their games are revelling in the celebrations. Suddenly the course seems to have been invaded by thousands of European fans, and the Americans are nowhere. The only noise that can be heard is from spectators of British and Irish persuasions chanting away. Splendid stuff. One feels sorry, though, for the European players who are still on the course. Their minds must be elsewhere now. Europe are up in three of the remaining matches, so an incredible 18.5 tally is not beyond them. USA 9.5 - 15.5 EUROPE (DiMarco beat Jimenez 1 up) All-American Chris DiMarco has beaten Miguel Angel Jimenez, but there's no excessive fist-pumping this time. The European fans don't care, they're singing in unison: \"Viva L'Espana.\" 10pm: Chris DiMarco has summed up why the American team has lost: \"Individually we all went out there today.\" He then realised he should add: \"As a team.\" It's an old cliche, but sometime they're the best sort: America have been a group of individuals, Europe have been a team. USA 9.5 - 16.5 EUROPE (Levet beat Funk 1 up) Now it's the French national anthem sounding out around the 18th green. Levet's point means that all of Europe's players have contributed to the victory. This is becoming humiliating for the US. 10.10pm: Hal Sutton has just said, cryptically: \"If you play golf a lot, you come to understand the hare and the tortoise. The hare wins an awful lot.\" Fair enough, Hal. Makes more sense than his speech in the opening ceremony. To his credit, he has taken defeat well and passed on his congratulations to the European team, admitting they were superior over the three days. USA 9.5 - 17.5 EUROPE (McGinley beat Cink 3&amp;2) This is turning into an absolute thrashing. McGinley was ahead from the very first hole and, cheered on by a mass of Irishman and women, he was probably the one European player to have more support than his opponent. He has certainly given them plenty to cheer. Another Irish point should follow shortly with Harrington marching up the 18th fairway one up in the only match left on the course. He is sure of a rapturous reception. USA 9.5 - 18.5 EUROPE (Harrington beat Haas 1 up) Padraig Harrington rounds off a remarkable triumph in suitable style - with a 25-foot putt straight into the cup. Now the celebrations can begin aproper. The champagne is uncorked and is soaking the players, coaches, fans and ground. Great scenes. It's been an amazing three days. Thanks for all your emails, I'm off to celebrate, Mike."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
