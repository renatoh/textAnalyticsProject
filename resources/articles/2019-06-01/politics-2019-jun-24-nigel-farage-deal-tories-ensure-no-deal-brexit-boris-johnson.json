He knows Boris, he speaks to Boris. Steve speaks to virtually everybody,\u201d Farage told a press conference when asked what he knew of Johnson\u2019s links to Bannon. The Brexit party leader said: \u201cI\u2019ve known Steve Bannon since 2012. There\u2019s no great secret about that. Boris, of course, got to know Bannon when he was foreign secretary, when he was visiting Washington and going into the West Wing, and that\u2019s how those two got to know each other.\u201d Farage\u2019s comments follow the emergence of video footage in which Bannon speaks about his relationship and contacts with Johnson, and says he helped him put together his first speech after his resignation as foreign secretary, in which Johnson condemned Theresa May\u2019s Brexit strategy. The footage, reported by the Observer, was shot in July last year by Alison Klayman, an American film-maker who followed Bannon over many months for a documentary called The Brink. The footage was not used in the film. One clip shows Bannon reading a story about Johnson\u2019s speech, before he says: \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to him all weekend about this speech. We went back and forth over the text.\u201d When reports emerged last year of links between Johnson and the far-right activist, who has tried to build up a network of populist movements across Europe, Johnson called them \u201ca lefty delusion whose spores continue to breed in the Twittersphere\u201d. A spokesman for Johnson said of the footage: \u201cAny suggestion that Boris is colluding with or taking advice from Mr Bannon or Nigel Farage is totally preposterous to the point of conspiracy.\u201d At the same event on Monday, Farage said he would back Johnson as prime minister, but only if he pushed for a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, saying he did not trust him to do this. \u201cHe\u2019ll have my support if he does the right thing. But I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d Farage said. \u201cI\u2019d love to know who the real Boris Johnson is, I\u2019d love to know what he really, really, truly believes. Our attitude, as the Brexit party, is why would we trust anybody?\u201d Speaking earlier to Talk Radio, Farage said he would consider a coalition with the Conservative party to ensure the UK left the EU without a deal. \u201cI\u2019d do a deal with the devil to get a proper, clean Brexit,\u201d he said. Asked about the prospect of an electoral pact, Farage said: \u201cIf Brexit is not delivered, there might be some local deals done here and there, but if the Conservative party drop the ball on this then they\u2019re toast.\u201d He pointedly praised Johnson, claiming many Eurosceptics had joined the Conservative party in the past few months to ensure he became prime minister. Farage said Johnson would be hailed as \u201can all-time national hero\u201d if he managed to face down parliament by delivering a no-deal Brexit by 31 October. He also backed Johnson after a row with his partner, Carrie Symonds, on Thursday night was recorded by her neighbours and reported to the police. \u201cI think for people to record through the wall what is being said is absolutely disgusting,\u201d Farage said. \u201cThere has to be a limit to this intrusion on people\u2019s private lives.\u201d But he did say the frontrunner for the Conservative leadership should have answered questions about the row at a hustings event on Saturday. \u201cAll he had to say is that there was an argument and the police were called by malicious neighbours. Who hasn\u2019t had an argument? That\u2019s all he had to say,\u201d Farage said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
