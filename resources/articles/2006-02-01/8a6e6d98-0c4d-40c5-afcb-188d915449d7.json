But it is worse than he outlines when it comes to the general lack of parking and toilet facilities. Our women truck drivers launched a \"free to pee\" campaign last year to shame government, local councils and employers into action. The T&amp;G has been campaigning for some time for decent and secure facilities where drivers can park up and have a decent rest. We put this on the government's agenda and we are seeing something moving now as transport minister Stephen Ladyman is taking the issue seriously. There is a shortage of drivers. We are campaigning for better pay, decent pensions and shorter hours but the industry often doesn't help itself by not looking after the basic needs of people. Ron Webb Transport &amp; General Workers Union The picture painted by Richard Simpson is more a tale of woe than my experience dictates. When we truckers deliver to a supermarket distribution centre we reverse on to a numbered loading dock and leave our key along with delivery notes at goods inwards. Moreover, every lorry I have driven in the last couple of years has a radio and a cab heater designed for overnight cosiness which are both independent of the ignition switch. I also have yet to encounter a goods inwards which doesn't have drivers' toilets, not to mention drinks and snack vending machines. He should bring a flask and a packed lunch like the rest of us and enjoy being paid for his time in solving the day's sudoku.
