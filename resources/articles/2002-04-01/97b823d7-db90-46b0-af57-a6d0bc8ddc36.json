On the cusp of Tony Blair's half decade in Downing Street and Gordon Brown's sixtieth month at the Treasury, only now do they rise to the greatest test of office. Since Mr Blair strode over the threshold of Number 10 saying it was 'time to do', his government have been a busy bunch. They have devolved to Scotland and Wales. They have semi-reformed one half of Parliament. Relations with Europe have been rebuilt and the Cabinet shivers on the edge of making a choice about the single currency. New Labour has silly, ephemeral failures to its name: the Millennium Dome. New Labour has significant historic achievements to its name: the settlement in Northern Ireland. They have got the fundamentals right by presiding over high growth and employment, low inflation and interest rates. This government has gone to war in Kosovo, in Afghanistan - and with itself. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have twice smashed the Tories. These are all large things. What they are not is the really big thing. For much of the past five years, New Labour has skirted around the edges of the opportunity presented by the landslide victory on May Day 1997, the challenge which was renewed by the second landslide in June last year. Is Britain basically a right-wing country which occasionally gives a temporary loan of power to an alternative when the Tories are exhausted of energy, ideas and plausible leaders? That was the tale of the twentieth century. Or is this a fundamentally progressive country which should belong to the centre-Left? That is what New Labour wants to be the story of the twenty-first century. This government has often seemed confused about its purpose because New Labour has been riddled with doubt about whether its ambitions to found a radical century were realisable. For all Mr Blair's denunciations of the forces of conservatism, for all Mr Brown's sallies against privilege, an obsession with placating right-wing interests and pandering to reactionary prejudices disfigured much of the Government's first term. When his head was timorously fevered by the tabloids and the focus groups, Mr Blair gave the impression that he feared he would be only allowed to govern the country so long as he didn't try to change it very much. Supporters of Gordon Brown project their hero as the nutritious Real Labour Ale to Tony Blair's gassy Third Way Lite. Yet the Chancellor, too, has quite often acted as if the only way to reform Britain is to pretend that he isn't. The poor might be helped, but only so long as carrots were wielded like sticks. A minimum wage could be introduced, but only so long as he sucked up to business. They have been social democrats, but social democrats trapped in the closet. Social democrats who, for reasons historical and electoral, rarely dared squeak their true convictions. The sixth Budget delivered by Mr Brown marks the moment when they finally pick up the gauntlet. Now we will see whether Britain is a country ready for social democracy. We will also find out whether New Labour is led by social democrats with the talent and toughness to mould Britain that way for good. That this juncture is so widely called a 'a gamble' - and described as such not least by members of the Cabinet - tells us how nervously and painfully they have arrived at this stage in the evolution of New Labour. This Budget is not a watershed because Gordon Brown has put up taxes. This Chancellor had done that before, and by a fair bit, before last week. But he did so furtively, as if raising funds for the public realm was shameful, even sinful. He used the stealth imposts which ran out of road when the fuel protests exploded in the autumn of 2000. On the rare occasions when Tony Blair was obliged squirmingly to concede that taxes had risen, the apologia offered by the Prime Minister was the conservative and fiscally orthodox justification of 'sorting out the mess' in the public finances inherited from the Tories. The dramatic difference this time is that the Government is not just putting up tax. It is doing so openly, proudly, almost braggingly. Mr Brown described it as 'a duty'. 'More than that, taxes will rise not out of compulsion, not because they've dashed the economy on the rocks. Taxes rise in the conviction that this will produce the radical improvements to public goods that Labour has long promised but not yet delivered. Messrs Blair and Brown for too long pandered to the Great Lie of British politics that we could enjoy ever-better public services and ever-lower levels of tax. Now they confront themselves and the country with the truth that serious spending requires serious tax, even if they still prefer to call it money for modernisation. This does not transmogrify them into red-blooded socialists. To hear the more hysterical hostility to the Budget, you would think that an impoverished Middle Britain will be reduced to drizzling its olive oil over fricasseed rat. Britons will still be lightly taxed compared with their neighbours in the larger economies of Europe. The howls of agony that the more affluent will be tortured by an effective top rate of 41 per cent are ludicrous. High earners were still paying a 60 per cent top rate into Margaret Thatcher's third term. The early opinion polls indicate, albeit before the tax rises have actually bitten, that the vast majority of the public think it right and fair to pay more for the NHS. Business gnashes its teeth and rends its pinstripes that companies will be expected to make some extra contribution to the common wealth. Digby Jones, the director-general of the CBI, is in a froth of indignation about \u00a34 billion a year which is really a modest corporate contribution to the nation's health when the CBI itself recently lamented that its members lose \u00a311bn a year in absences due to sickness. It should occur to thoughtful chief executives that it is a sensible investment for their companies if valuable employees no longer spend months languishing on waiting-lists. Readers of the fine print of the Budget will spot that the amount the Chancellor is scheduling to repay in debt falls away sharply in 2005 which - guess what? - is the most likely year of the next election. I would not be in the least amazed if there were cuts in taxes just before the Government offers itself for a third term. This is still a New Labour government. There is an inescapable irony that the great modernisers have pinned their reputations to the health service, the finest and most enduring creation of Old Labour. But it is a caricature to see this as the burial of New Labour by Red Brown. Blairites and Brownites are unusually unanimous in denying that. The Chancellor is naturally sunning himself in the delight of Labour backbenches. And just when clouds of internal dissent scud more darkly across Tony Blair than at any time since he became leader. Yet, if anything, their fates are now more closely entwined than ever. Mr Blair's prospects of being considered a truly outstanding Prime Minister and Mr Brown's chances of following him to Number 10 are equally dependent on success. Together, they challenge the political wisdom, a fear branded nowhere more deeply than into the souls of the men who created New Labour, that no party can take or hold office by putting up direct personal taxes. Like most forks in the political road, this one was signposted some way ahead. Indeed, New Labourites insist that it was always imprinted on the master map of the Project. Phase One was to exorcise the ghosts of past Labour failure by proving that they were competent stewards of the economy. That was achieved by the brilliant stroke of giving control over interest rates to the Bank of England and the much more tendentious decision to strap themselves into the corset of Tory spending limits for the first two years of the Government's life. Phase Two was to demonstrate that they could tax fairly and spend wisely. Phase Three was to rehabilitate the case for raising taxes to expand the state. This chronicle has the merit of placing the Budget in a seamlessly constructed New Labour narrative. It has the demerit of not being entirely true. The strategy was there, but its execution has been swirled in hesitancy and muddle. It is a fact infrequently considered that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown both came to power with absolutely no experience whatsoever of managing anything. They were na\u00efve about how long it takes governments to achieve change. They under-estimated how decrepit the public services had become in the quarter century since the IMF imposed spending cuts on the last Labour government. They were blithe in their assumption that, simply because they were not those wicked Tories, it necessarily followed that they had to be better at delivering health care. It was only during the winter flu crisis of 2000 that Tony Blair truly became seized by the state of the NHS and took it up as the most important domestic mission of his premiership by setting the target of matching average European spending. 'You've stolen my fucking Budget,' Mr Brown raged at the Prime Minister. It was only after the most fearsome battles with his Chancellor that the latter was convinced that public unrest could only be met by putting in money before they had a proper programme of reform. You did not need to be a professor of mathematics - you really only needed an IQ larger than your shoe size - to see that this meant higher taxes. Even at the last election, they could not muster the courage or the candour to quite say so. The 1 per cent hike in National Insurance contributions certainly breaks the spirit, if not the exact letter, of the pledge not to increase tax on income. This was not just because New Labour treated the electorate with cynicism, it was because they still regarded the voters with trepidation. Even against such a pygmy opponent as William Hague, both Prime Minister and Chancellor feared to be honest. Still spooked by the bogey of tax and spend, when the Tories made an issue of National Insurance, there was considerable agitation within the Labour campaign team to rule out the very rises now allocated to pay for the extra spending on the health service. Mr Brown was previously vetoed by Mr Blair about a new top rate of tax. In this case, the Chancellor was implacable that they had to keep as many revenue-raising options open as possible. There was a Conservative contribution to this new chapter of New Labour. The Tories made it easier to write by losing the last election so comprehensively and then by trying to turn themselves into a party that cared for public services. The fresh Tory dilemma is whether to match the Government commitments or to revert to Thatcherism, to readopt the faith which burns in the heart of Iain Duncan Smith and most of the Shadow Cabinet, to become again the tax-cutting party. The Liberal Democrats also helped to shape this moment by campaigning for honest taxation and demonstrating that this message could win votes in places as comfortable and leafy as Guildford. It is a compliment to Charles Kennedy that his song is now heard on the lips of the Cabinet, though it is a lollipop with a poisonous centre. Now that Labour has taken their ground, where do the Liberal Democrats pitch themselves to be distinctive? The consolation for the opposition parties is that they do not have to prove anything to the voters any time all that soon. The Government does. A cascade of cash will pour into the health service at precisely the same time as it will be in the throes of tumultuous structural change. Even Derek Wanless, the pet banker whom the Chancellor asked to review the NHS, concludes that the sums flowing in are at the extreme limit of what can be sensibly managed. The tax rises will arrive more quickly than the thousands of promised new doctors and nurses. It is in the gap between promises and delivery that public disillusion grows. It is in that gap that shrewd Tories will seek to foment discontent with the Government. It is difficult to believe that such thumping increases - 7.4 per cent above inflation for five years - will not make any difference at all by the time of the next election. What most troubles Ministers is whether they will get any credit for the improvements. The corruption of the character of New Labour in the eyes of much of the public has not just been because of the succession of sleaze episodes. As much, perhaps more so, it has been the over-boasting of its past performance that has embedded scepticism about any of this government's claims for itself. They have fallen back on the hope that people won't have to believe the Government when it claims that things really are getting better. Personal experience of using the health service will tell people so, what one Number 10 aide calls 'the power of anecdote'. Nothing of importance in politics was ever achieved without taking risks. And, for New Labour, the biggest risk was not to make a serious attempt to scale its ambitions. If a Labour government cannot at least try to deliver a better health service, then it renders moot the point of having a Labour government. If you flunk the chance to attempt to remould Britain as a social democracy, then why be in power at all? That is why New Labour had to grow up. To fail the challenge might be bad. Never to have addressed the challenge would be so much worse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
