They could call it Going Down the West Brom Way or perhaps even Bouncing Back with the Baggies. Few clubs can have taken relegation in their stride the way Albion have done. In fact, they have gained strength from their year in the Premiership. Last season's frugal financial policy paid dividends over the summer. While Sunderland and West Ham were forced to jettison their top players, Albion spent close to \u00a32m on strengthening the squad with seven newcomers. Saturday's victory here was, although undeserved, their fourth consecutive win and shows that the club's refusal to gamble with their future while in the Premiership is being justified on their return to the First Division. \"It would have been vindicated even if we hadn't been able to bring players in,\" said the manager Gary Megson. \"This division and the one below is littered with clubs where being in the Premiership was the best thing that ever happened to them and also the worst. \"As a football club we made a conscious decision that we wouldn't spend money we hadn't got. Consequently we can do things that a lot of clubs can't. That's not down to luck.\" Indeed it is not. At \u00a38m West Bromwich's wage bill was around \u00a310m less than any other Premiership club last year. That takes careful planning. \"There was bound to be a shortfall on the football field,\" said Megson. \"The upshot of that is we went down but we are a strong club.\" How Derby could have done with their opponents' guidebook two years ago. After a miserable first season back in the Nationwide, the Rams now find themselves \u00a330m in debt, up for sale and, after this defeat, bottom of the league. \"Over the last two or three years the club has been decimated,\" said their manager George Burley. \"Our aim this season is to stabilise the club and then build on it. It could easily go the other way.\" The \"other way\" is the way of Barnsley and Sheffield Wednesday - case studies of the cost of relegation. But somehow Burley remains upbeat despite Rob Hulse's late winner condemning Derby to their third home defeat of the season. \"We're not getting carried away,\" said Hulse. \"We're top of the league now but we want to be there at the end of the season.\" Man of the match: Rob Hulse (West Brom)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
