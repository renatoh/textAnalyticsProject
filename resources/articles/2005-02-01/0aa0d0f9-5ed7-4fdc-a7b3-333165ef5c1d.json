These great houses are terrific, and somehow different from their English counterparts. Even though they have always done 'tatty' with panache, they do 'elegant' with equal gusto. Some of these places will take your breath away. But one of the Irish tricks is to convey a passion for human contact in preference to all else, so you won't find much pretension among these 'special places' - however magnificent they may be. 1 Drumcovitt House Feeny, Co Londonderry (02877 781224; drumcovitt.com). Doubles/triples from \u00a346-\u00a354. Singles \u00a323-\u00a327. No wonder poets and writers love Drumcovitt, its atmosphere is like no other, earthy and diaphanous, hands-on hard work and landed grandeur. Christopher and his young family, who are gradually taking over from his parents, are likeable and attentive. The original workaday farmhouse on the hill shrank from sight in 1796 when a lofty declaration of Georgian wealth was stretched across its face: gilded pelmets, beehive door knobs, cornices, and ancient carpets dazzle you in the drawing room and dining room, both unaffectedly magnificent. Gentle shallow stairs sweep up to a creaky landing lined with old books. Only the highest peaks and the spire of Banagher church are visible on misty mornings from the large uncluttered bedrooms. Nothing pretentious, lovely people, exceptional value and a prehistoric ring-fort through the woods. 2 Rathmullan House Rathmullan (Lough Swilly), Co Donegal (00 353 74 915 8188; rathmullanhouse.com). Doubles \u20ac160-\u20ac270. Singles \u20ac80-\u20ac135. What a place! Always a step ahead: one of the new rooms has its own dog room. But despite expansion, the four younger Wheelers (also busy producing their own next generation) maintain the homely, family feel that their parents created and there are so many elegant sitting rooms inside, such lovely gardens to roam outside, that numbers may only be evident at breakfast. Rathmullan has fine Georgian looks, gardens that roll gently down to the spectacular shores of Lough Swilly, and comforting fires. The richly furnished new rooms, all different shapes, overlook the garden through superb tall windows on to balconies or little terraces and have big panelled bathrooms. The tent-like canopied restaurant has a good reputation, the local salmon and lamb are superb. Work up an appetite at tennis or croquet, in the indoor heated pool or the steamroom. A good base for the rocky coves and beaches of the Fanad Peninsula. Rathmullanvillage has bags of seaside charm. 3 Coxtown Manor Laghey, Co Donegal (00 353 74 973 4575; coxtownmanor.com). Doubles \u20ac80-\u20ac165. Singles \u20ac50-\u20ac125. Relaxed and amiable, Eduard came from Belgium to turn a drab Georgian manor into a popular Donegal getaway. Owned by Hamiltons from 1750 until 'Miss Sheila' died in 1992, it oozes history. Eduard combines original wallpaper with continental antiques, minimalist art with tapestries and a sleek black piano. The reception room, with a fine stone fireplace in the cosy bar, is perfect for chilling out. Bedrooms come in two styles: grand in the main house with old furniture, lots of space and open fires, contemporary in the coach house, with super power showers and modern art. But the restaurant is Coxtown's heart. A great chef, Eduard uses the freshest produce in a few beautifully cooked and presented dishes followed by mousse made with real Belgian chocolate or his own ice cream. Free-range hens give wonderful eggs: Belgian breakfast is a must. 4 Castle Leslie Glaslough, Co Monaghan (00 353 47 88100; castleleslie.com). Castle doubles from \u20ac270-\u20ac370. Singles \u20ac170-\u20ac220. Lodge doubles from \u20ac150. Singles \u20ac100. Ah! Castle Leslie, the crazy stories, the serenity, the inimitable rooms. Strong and fearless with a huge sense of fun, like all the artistic, eccentric Leslies, Sammy now runs the family home, its theatrical dining hall, its living museum of a drawing room where a million portrait cameos, fine antiques, heaps of Churchilliana (they are related) and ramshackle mementos live in fading grandeur with yards of sofas and the vast lake view. Up the great stairs, bedrooms big and small burst with flair and individuality, weird and wonderful Victorian loos to boot. Food is vital: top-class gastronomy by Noel McMeel on the Castle's fine white linen, country fare at the Lodge, snacks in the Gallery. The much simpler Lodge is being done up: bring horses, rods, children to discover the wonderful estate. Informal-grand, funky, enchanting - an unforgettable experience. Riding centre and cookery school, too. Castle unsuitable for children. Exclusive bookings possible. 5 Ardtarmon House Ballinfull, Co Sligo (00 353 71 916 3156; ardtarmon.com). Doubles \u20ac74-\u20ac94. Singles \u20ac52-\u20ac62. Amazingly, Ardtarmon started as a thatched cottage. The Henrys' ancestral home since 1852, it grew to country house stature a century ago. The mountains of four counties (Mayo, Leitrim, Donegal, Knocknarea in Sligo, Yeats's inspiration) are visible; the sand and crashing surf are a short walk; on a clear day the eye wanders 60 miles out to sea. Family oils and antiques lend warmth to the main rooms; bedrooms, big and comfy, give on to gardens, a labyrinth of walls, tangled orchards and a giant cedar with a treehouse. The hosts, Charles and Christa, are a relaxed and welcoming couple. Charles's hearty cooking is served in the west-facing dining room tinged with glorious sunset gold. Really good value. 6 Temple House Ballymote, Co Sligo (00 353 71 918 3329; templehouse.ie). Closed: December-March. Doubles \u20ac130-\u20ac170. Singles from \u20ac85. The gardens, stretching down to the lake, include the ruins of three earlier Temple Houses - medieval, Tudor, Jacobean. The looming bulk of the present house, built in 1864 by the 'Chinaman' ancestor (he made fortunes out east), reveals grandeurs galore in a welcoming, relaxing family atmosphere, tall drawing-room windows admiring their original crumbling silk and gold curtains in the hugest mirrors. After that echoing hall where a hundred could waltz, the 'Half-Acre' bedroom confirms the scale. The Victorian mahogany loos are a sheer delight. Other rooms are smaller yet always basking in this old-fashioned ease. Roderick, Helena and their young children have taken over from his parents, filling the house with enthusiasm. An exceptional experience. 7 Ballynahinch Castle Hotel Recess, Co Galway (00 353 95 31006; ballynahinch-castle.com). Closed Christmas week and February. Doubles \u20ac190-\u20ac400. Ballynahinch, 'the household of the island', with several thousand acres of fishing and shooting rights, once claimed the longest drive in the world (28 miles from Oughterard). Today, after a 700-year absence, the house is back in O'Flaherty hands. His predecessors were labelled 'ferocious', but Patrick is a friendly dapper presence in Irish tweed who looks after people with genuine warmth and his staff make you feel like you are the only guest here. A maze of rooms, the present house was expanded from an inn in 1813 by Richard Martin, a famous duellist and MP. In 1924, a maharaja cricketer known fondly to locals as Ranji, bought the castle, landscaped the gardens and kept elephants and bears on the island. Guitarist Eric Clapton caught his first salmon here. Panelling was made with estate timber, bedroom furniture is locally crafted, there is elegance, luxury, comfort and variety. Ballynahinch is very special. 8 Cregg Castle Corrandulla, Co Galway (00 353 91 791434; creggcastle.com). Doubles \u20ac130-\u20ac170. Singles \u20ac65-\u20ac85. Over three centuries lie on the battlements of this unique place whose relaxed furnishings and home-made four-posters are perfectly fitting. There's little formality here; indeed, it must be one of the most laid-back guest houses in Ireland. Pat and Ann Marie, down-to-earth characters, play a variety of instruments and most evenings there is traditional Irish music in the great 11th-century hall. Guests are welcome to join in the craic. Eccentric bedrooms vary in size and design: some are enormous with lovely views, bathrooms rejoice in lime green linoleum and other Seventies delights. Generous breakfast is served all day at the vast antique table. Children love the animals and the freedom, adults love the peace, music and conversation. 9 The Mustard Seed at Echo Lodge Ballingarry, Co Limerick (00 353 69 68508; mustardseed.ie). Doubles \u20ac180-\u20ac300. Singles from \u20ac120. The Mustard Seed scores 10 out of 10 on all counts. The staggering kitchen garden - a work of art - produces artichokes and alpine strawberries, pumpkins and exotic cucumbers. Wine is made from their own grapes. Dan Mullane's cheerful energy makes this place sparkle: nothing seems beyond his creative grasp. Step over the sleeping cat into a sumptuous world of understated excess. Deep sofas, carved marble fireplaces, crackling fires, bedrooms with big armoires, lacquered screens, exotic wall hangings, rugs on warm wood floors - with 10 rooms in the main house and six in the old schoolhouse where ground-floor suites have windows on to terraces. Don't miss the exceptional food in a superb atmosphere of candles and opulent flowers on every table. They even have their own bakery, making whatever they can with their own hands. We haven't even scratched the surface, so come and dig deeper yourself. 10 Carrig House Killorglin, Co Kerry (00 353 66 976 9100; carrighouse.com). Closed December-February. Doubles \u20ac130-\u20ac350. Singles \u20ac110-\u20ac180. Reached by a long wooded drive, this mid-19th century country house looks out on to the timeless beauty of Caragh Lake, a supreme spot, discovered by Frank and Mary 25 years ago. They run their stylish house with a good-natured professional touch: he, full of charm and disarming patter; she, ministering with sincere warmth and a big smile (she is also the interior designer). Dinner, by a multi-talented team of chefs, is memorable: Carrig's reputation - 'possibly the best restaurant in Kerry' - is well deserved. Ponder the menu with an aperitif by the fire in the snug drawing room then move into the intimate atmosphere of the lake-view dining room. Bedrooms mix old and modern. The suite, with its lushly draped arch and lake views, and the double, with wisteria creeping round the windows, both have a lovely old-fashioned grace. The garden has nearly 1,000 plant species. There are walks through woods with secluded seating areas, a path down to the lake and the small jetty. Fishing, golf and hill walking can be arranged. Children aged over 10 welcome. 11 Ballylickey Manor House Bantry Bay, Co Cork (00 353 27 50071; ballylickeymanorhouse.com). Closed November-mid-March. Doubles \u20ac220-\u20ac350. The lawns of Ballylickey roll down to Bantry Bay, Whiddy Island looms across the water, the Caha mountains rise beyond. You'd never know, but the house is only 20 years old: a fire demolished the greater part of its 300-year-old predecessor, home to four generations of Franco-Irish Graveses (poet Robert came often). The River Ouvane lopes along the northern boundary, fishermen may borrow rods and if you have some luck, they'll cook your catch for supper. The hotel sprawls round delightful gardens with a pool in the middle, a lunchtime restaurant on its terrace. You can even sleep rough: some rather smart chalets went up in 1961 and you get raw pine walls, plush bedrooms and peace on the edge of the woods. Up in the house quiet elegance flows, a cheetah-skin rug covers a banister, sea views float past the windows, open fires smoulder in the four drawing rooms. Good beds, rich fabrics, loads of books, all the country-house essentials. Nearby is Gougane Barra, a 6th-century monastery by a lake where you can see the monks' cells - or even get married; St Finnbar left it to become the first bishop of Cork. 12 Walton Court Country House and Spa Oysterhaven, Co Cork (00 353 21 477 0878; waltoncourt.com). Closed December-February unless by prior arrangement. Doubles \u20ac108-\u20ac165. Singles \u20ac86-\u20ac132. A charming, modest and irrepressibly energetic couple, Paul and Janis took a restoration course then rebuilt this ruined 18th-century manor (removing 92 tons of soil from the hall) and its courtyard buildings; they filled the house with colour, comfort, myriad intriguing objects and works of art, Africana from their time in Kenya. The view down to Oysterhaven harbour is perfect today but they arrived to a dense jungle - not a dot of blue could be seen and the sea is 150 yards from the front door. Now, Paul has built a jetty down there (the marina comes next), and a seawater pool in the courtyard garden, and an old railway station in the woods. They rear their own wasps to keep bugs off their kitchen garden and offer spa and health weekends. The courtyard catches the setting sun and you eat, extremely well, in the shimmering conservatory or the dark suggestive dining room. A remarkable place in so many ways. 13 Ballinkeele House Ballymurn, Co Wexford (00 353 53 38105; ballinkeele.com). Closed December-January. Doubles \u20ac140-\u20ac180. Singles \u20ac90-\u20ac110. You arrive to a vision of spreading grandeur, ultimately concentrated in the pillared portico. You enter. The play of heavy and light follows you from room to room. Ballinkeele was designed with space and light in mind. John and Margaret are a great team, his delight in his family seat and 'all the things his grandfather collected on the Grand Tour', her modest pride in her sense of colour and texture (she has green fingers too); her cooking skills, his splendid butler act. Each huge room is adorned with Margaret's paintings and old family pictures. Bedrooms are exquisite, the jewel in the crown being the superb four-poster room. Outside, John supervises garden and forestry. Inside, Margaret presides over succulent meals (that includes breakfast) in the heavy red dining room, just the right period feel. A splendid place to relax and walk round lakes in 360 acres of grounds. These two genuinely want you to feel at ease. 14 Clone House Aughrim, Co Wicklow (00 353 402 36121; clonehouse.com). Doubles \u20ac130-\u20ac180. Singles \u20ac105-\u20ac180. Carla has brought the flavour and sunshine of the Mediterranean to a remote and delightful corner of the Wicklow Mountains. Bred in Tuscany, she ran cafes before moving to America for 15 years. There she met Jeff. They've now come to Ireland to bring up their children. Come up a long drive to a courtyard of terracotta pots and a smiling Carla at the door. The menu is mouth-watering: stuffed quails wrapped in pancetta, osso bucco, maybe white chocolate cheesecake to follow. She won't buy anything ready-made if she can make it herself and her focaccia bread is irresistible. A warm ochre finish softens the building's sturdy appearance. Originally south-facing, it was burnt down in the 1798 rebellion, though not before the lady of the house had been carried out on her bed! Lovely bedrooms mix rural Italy with a touch of the baroque as rich colours, Regency fabrics and voile drapes dress glowing floorboards and textured brickwork; some have open fires lit before you arrive. There's a folksy Irish snug, a waterfall, even a sauna, but Carla is the star here. 15 Ghan House Carlingford, Co Louth (00 353 42 937 3682). Doubles \u20ac170-\u20ac190. Singles from \u20ac70. Early 18th-century Ghan House is enclosed within the walls of Carlingford, probably the best-preserved medieval town in Ireland. Lying at the base of Slieve Foy which rises impressively behind, the house looks over Carlingford Lough to the Mourne Mountains in the distance, a beautiful setting. Some guests prefer the bedrooms in the creaky timeworn atmosphere of the house, others the peace and quiet of the converted dairy next door. There are arched doorways, corbelled ceilings, a half-tester bed, proper bathrooms - everything is impeccably done and everywhere you find family antiques, personal bits, a feeling of utter comfort. Dinners are just as special so do book. The Carrolls know and enjoy what they are doing and are genuinely friendly with it. You won't be short of things to do, either. Pubs, restaurants, watersports, hill-walking, a Ghan House cookery course or the simple pleasure of sitting by a turf fire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
