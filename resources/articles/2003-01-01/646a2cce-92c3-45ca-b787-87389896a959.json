I can recommend a local Costa Rican operator - I think its name is EcoSafari Adventures. It's a small company that caters to the needs of individual travellers, tailor-making specialist itineraries. I'm sure it will be able to provide you with full support from day one in a friendly and professional way. Try the website, EcoSafari, or contact them via email: info@ecosafari.co.cr. By the way, I read about them in the FT Expat Magazine (November's edition). So get a copy of that magazine if possible and read the article on Costa Rica; the author (John Ruler) seemed to have had a fantastic time with them.
