His 2008 hit I Remember generated 11m MySpace plays, and he was such a draw at the Reading festival that very few could get near the stage to see him performing in a giant rodent's head. Although this is a stopgap compilation of his productions, his music similarly injects a bit of personality into what can be anonymous club sounds. His berserk mixes could easily feature the kind of progressive keyboard sounds that ELP's Keith Emerson once made by attacking an organ with a knife, or veer into The Death March. Although his piano gets thoughtful on occasions, he's never far from speaker-rattling bass grooves, guaranteed to move the feet and make you very unpopular with the neighbours."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
