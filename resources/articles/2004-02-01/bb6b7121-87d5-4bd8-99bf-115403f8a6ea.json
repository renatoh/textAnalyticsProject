Mr Manley is the director of the Sussex Archaeological Society, which operates six small museums at historic properties in the county. Along with hundreds of independent museums, from Bedesworld in Northumbria to Anne of Cleves' house in Lewes, Fishbourne Palace is facing financial disaster when the government abolishes a small, obscure tax concession. In the last two years museums, encouraged by the Association of Independent Museums, and some independent consultants, realised they could take advantage of a \"gift aid\" tax concession. This allows charities to reclaim tax on donations from UK taxpayers. The loophole for museums worked by visitors agreeing to make a \"donation\" equal to the admission fee, and in return they were nominally admitted free. The piece of tidying up by the Treasury, barely noticed in the chancellor's pre-budget statement in December, is estimated to lose the museum sector \u00a310m a year. It will hit the big heritage bodies, including the National Trust, English Heritage and Historic Royal Palaces, hard. However most observers believe it will be a catastrophe for the independent sector, which will drive some small museums into bankruptcy. Ironbridge Gorge estimates the loss of the tax concession at \u00a3100,000, the Sussex Archaeology Trust at \u00a350,000, and the award winning Black Country Museum estimates the loss at \u00a380,000 and is already planning to make two new curators redundant. \"This has been the most significant government help to small local museums in the last decade, and its removal will be a disaster,\" Sam Mullins, chair of the Association of Independent Museums, said. AIM has pledged to fight to keep the measure, with the backing of the former culture secretary Chris Smith. \"It's desperately sad, and there's no doubt that some small museums will go to the wall over this,\" said Lord Redesdale, leader of the all-party parliamentary archaeology group - and the owner of a small museum, a reconstructed Roman fort on his land in Northumbria. The news that the tax concession was being abolished was buried in the pre-budget statement, claiming that charities which do not admit visitors were disadvantaged. The museums dispute this, arguing that going to a museum does not in any way stop people giving to charity. However, the scheme did not appeal to all independent museums.\"I chose to wait and see how many other museums took up this scam - that's what I thought it was,\" said Kate Biggs, director of the Dean Heritage Museum in the Forest of Dean. Her small charity is always hovering on the edge of financial ruin, but despite repeated approaches from one of the commercial consultancy firms, she decided it was too risky. \"This was always a loophole, and it was inevitable that it would be closed at some point.\" In Sussex, John Manley and his trustees have had to tear up their financial plan for the next year. And they are left with the Fishbourne Palace cash registers, which they installed with expensive software specifically to collect the information to take advantage of the tax concession. \"We are a small charity, we don't get a penny of public monies to support our revenue costs,\" Mr Manley said. \"The money we spent at Fishbourne is now completely wasted, we would never have done it if we dreamed we were going to lose the provision.\" Although the Treasury is completing a consultation process with the museum sector, the only sliver of hope is that the measure may not be implemented for a year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
