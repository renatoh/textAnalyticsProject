Craster was born in Oxford, the son of the Bodleian librarian Sir Edmund, but the Crasters were of Northumberland stock and Oswin spent much of his later life in the fishing village of Craster. This was once mostly owned by his family and Craster Tower remains a landmark on the Northumberland coast. Educated at Stowe school and New College, Oxford, Craster joined the Ancient Monuments Inspectorate (AMI) in 1938 after a stay in Switzerland, where he learned French. In the same year he enlisted in a territorial battalion of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire light infantry and was called up on the outbreak of war in 1939. He became a subaltern in 1940 but his unit remained in Britain. Frustrated by inactivity, Craster volunteered when he read a mysterious circular late in 1943, asking for Francophone volunteers for special service. \"Particular danger\" was promised. The appeal came from the SOE, set up by Winston Churchill in 1940 to \"set Europe ablaze\" by clandestine operations, arming and working with resistance groups in occupied Europe and later the far east. France was the focus of efforts, especially when preparations began for the Normandy invasion in 1944. General Sir Colin Gubbins of SOE set up three-man teams to be dropped into France. Craster led team \"Stanley\", assigned to set up drop zones for airborne supplies in the Haute-Marne region. He was to work with resistance units in preventing the destruction of engineering plants by retreating Germans, while guiding allied troops as they advanced. D-day came and went on June 6, leaving a fuming Stanley team in a London hotel wondering if they would ever go into action. The call came at last on August 31. They were briefed en route to Tempsford airfield in Bedfordshire and took off in a Stirling bomber in the late evening, to arrive over their drop zone just before midnight. The pilot flew too high, and so the team and their weapons canisters were scattered over a wide area. Two days later they had all linked up with local French forces. For two weeks the Stanley team supplied information on German dispositions, too late to prevent demolition of the plant they were meant to save. They were involved in several skirmishes, advancing to meet and guide two advancing American armies. In his report, Craster concluded that his team had been dispatched at least a month too late and complained that many of its messages and requests, including one for an undamaged radio, had been ignored. But he received a mention in dispatches and was awarded the Croix de Guerre. He volunteered for more SOE work and on April 1 1945 was dropped into Burma with group \"Zebra\". Frustrated at a lack of cooperation by the local resistance, Craster's group marched 100 miles to the west to join another group in operations against the Japanese. He won a second \"mention\" for this. After the war Craster, known for his dry wit and keen on forestry and gardening as well as his family's heritage, returned to the AMI. He worked mostly in southern England until he was made chief inspector for Wales; he retired as chief inspector for England in 1976. The head of the family, Sir John Craster, who died that year, had sold the bulk of the estate in 1965. The residue was left to Oswin; but he and two other cousins combined in 1966 to buy back the 14th-century tower, which they divided into three dwellings. Oswin moved in permanently on retirement. In 1944 he married Mary Molony, then serving in the Wrens. She survives him, as do their two daughters and one son. \u00b7 Oswin Edmund Craster, ancient buildings inspector and SOE operative, born June 28 1916; died January 29 2006"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
