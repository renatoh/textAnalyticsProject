The stop-motion animation may have been made in Poland, but its wonky soundtrack was composed and recorded by a couple of post-punk theatre performers from Leeds. Accordingly, a maverick DIY feel pervades. Graeme Miller and Steve Shill\u2019s synths sound as primitive as the most rudimentary 8-bit computer games, while Partytime shares a bass guitar break with Nick Lowe\u2019s 1978 new wave gem I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass. Like Jansson\u2019s stories, the music can also be eerie. Midwinter Rites\u2019 percussion is unsettling, and Comet Shadow could have graced one of Brian Eno\u2019s ambient albums of the era. The leitmotifs of The Moomins Theme and Woodland Band will give anyone who saw the series as a child a Proustian rush, but amazingly, it\u2019s the first time this remarkable soundtrack has been issued."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
