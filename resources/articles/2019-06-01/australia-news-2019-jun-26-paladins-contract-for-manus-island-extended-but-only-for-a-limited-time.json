The $423m Paladin contract \u2013 which currently works out at a cost of at least $1,600 per day for each refugee and asylum seeker, not including food or medical care \u2013 was due to expire next week, ending the third contract extension since Paladin was engaged in late 2017. In a joint statement the Australian home affairs department and PNG\u2019s immigration and citizenship authority said the two governments had agreed to \u201ca limited extension of existing contract arrangements\u201d. In parallel they would also review whether current contract arrangements were fit for purpose. Paladin\u2019s subcontracts with other companies \u2013 most of which have also been controversial \u2013 also expire on 30 June. \u201cThe Papua New Guinea government has advised it intends to assume responsibility for service delivery and will contract local providers through an open market competitive procurement process,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile procurement processes take time, Australia will work with Papua New Guinea to transition to new service providers within the quickest possible time, at which time Australian-held contracts will be terminated.\u201d The extension would allow PNG authorities time \u201cto undertake its open and transparent procurement processes and to ensure services are maintained\u201d, the statement said. No further details were provided and the statement said neither government would provide \u201congoing commentary\u201d on future negotiations. The PNG government was supposed to take over garrison services for the asylum seekers and refugees sent to Manus Island by the Australian government\u2019s offshore processing regime, but at the last minute indicated it could not. The Australian government has blamed the last minute change on its decision to engage the inexperienced and little known company through a limited tender process. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, had indicated it would be extended but refused to confirm, leading to public pronouncements by PNG ministers \u2013 including the prime minister, James Marape, on Tuesday \u2013 demanding that it be handed over to the PNG government. \u201cWe don\u2019t intend to have foreign security companies engage in businesses like security which we can do,\u201d Marape said. The contract is the subject of several reviews in Australia, including one by the auditor general examining all of the government\u2019s contracts for the offshore processing systems on Manus Island and Nauru. That audit is forecast to deliver its report in January 2020. Labor had called for the government to release a commissioned Ernst &amp; Young review into the contract \u2013 ordered in March but still yet released \u2013 before it made any decision on Paladin\u2019s renewal, but on Wednesday offered qualified support for the announcement. \u201cLabor welcomes the fact an open market competitive procurement process will be undertaken for future contracts in PNG, something Peter Dutton failed to do with Paladin,\u201d Labor\u2019s home affairs spokeswoman, Kristina Keneally, said. \u201cAustralia still has skin in the game and it is incumbent on Peter Dutton to ensure any future contracts in PNG are fit for purpose and ensure value for money if services are being funded by the Australian taxpayer.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
