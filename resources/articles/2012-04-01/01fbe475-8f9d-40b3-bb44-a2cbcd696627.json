That's no doubt why for their first project together the pair have created the comic book identity that is Major Lazer \u2013 a \"Jamaican commando\" with lasers for arms, who is the true voice of the pair's 2009 debut album. Still, if their fictional backstory is vaguely diverting, the music that the pair and their guest MCs make is deadly serious, an assault charge on dancehall's digital rhythms, twisted into new shapes. The collaboration has created some head-turning music (Pon De Floor was used in Beyonc\u00e9's Run The World (Girls), produced by Switch), while live, wild hype man Skerrit Bwoy ensures magnificent confusion. HMV Ritz, Manchester, Wed; O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire, W12, Thu; HMV Institute, Birmingham, Fri John Robinson Graham Coxon, On tour Every time Damon Albarn records a new musical idea, he does it under a different alias. Fellow Blur-ite Graham Coxon has his own stylistic changes \u2013 but he records them all under his given name. As a result, the acoustic folk, lo-fi punk and melodic power-pop of his solo catalogue is an eclectic, at times confusing body of work. On his latest (and best) album, A+ E, however, he seems to have channelled much of this \u2013 guitar noise, tunes, layers, wit \u2013 all at the same time, but has created a singular kind of order rather than chaos. An untidy room is said to be the sign of an untidy mind. Coxon's latest music is the product of just such a room \u2013 but a reminder that neatness is overrated. The Sage Gateshead, Sun; Liquid Room, Edinburgh, Mon; The Garage, Glasgow, Tue; Sound Control, Manchester, Thu; The Leadmill, Sheffield, Fri JR Clock Opera, On tour Much recent British electropop has sounded less new and vibrant and more like driving music for alienated yuppies. With the likes of Metronomy, and their memorable tunes, that's no bad thing. When it's done by a band such as Everything Everything, however, there's no musical substance. Clock Opera, the project of producer Guy Connelly, means we're breathlessly in the same neck of the woods. Breathless because Clock Opera's Ways To Forget debut is an incredibly busy record, full of shifts of texture and skittering rhythms. But, for all the hard work, it's hard to find much that's memorable. Live, his full band may flesh things out somewhat. King Tut's Wah Wah Hut, Glasgow, Sat; The Cockpit, Leeds, Sun; The Harley, Sheffield, Tue; The Rainbow, Birmingham, Wed; 10 Feet Tall, Cardiff, Thu; The Boileroom, Guildford, Fri JR Tineke Postma, London Two memorable recent albums from young Dutch saxophonist Tineke Postma gave notice that the newcomer was big enough to engage the best collaborators \u2013 drum star Terri Lyne Carrington and Grammy-winning bass celebrity Esperanza Spalding contributed to those sessions. Postma's supple and soft alto and soprano lines spur thoughts of Wayne Shorter, Lee Konitz or Jan Garbarek, but she can be robust and vigorous on uptempo music too. Postma twists effortlessly between free-time and swing and introduces new tonal subtleties into the alto saxophone over a tenor-like low-end punch. She's a real discovery, and a fine composer too. Pizza Express Jazz Club, W1, Mon, Tue John Fordham Alan Broadbent, London The elegant Kiwi pianist Alan Broadbent is probably best known to UK audiences through his work with American bass star Charlie Haden's cool and canny Quartet West. But this short tour is the first time the two-time Grammy-winning Broadbent (who has a big parallel career as an arranger and accompanist for Paul McCartney, Natalie Cole, Diana Krall and other stars) has performed in Europe as a pianist-leader, accompanied by the classy Hamburg rhythm section of bassist Philipp Steen and drummer Kai Bussenius. Broadbent has often made memorable solo contributions to Quartet West gigs, sometimes as dazzling confections of old-school stride-piano rhythms, classical references, blues and forceful post-bop. Despite mostly working for famous employers, the New Zealand-born pianist has made a raft of acclaimed albums under his own name. Getting close up at these small-venue gigs will offer a fascinating chance to hear why. Bull's Head, SW13, Sat JF The Yellow Wallpaper, Cardiff Simon Holt has been the BBC National Orchestra of Wales's composer in association since 2008, and created three major works. Thierry Fischer conducts the premiere of the last of them this week. The Yellow Wallpaper is a dramatic scena for soprano and orchestra; Lisa Milne is the soloist here. David Harsent has written the libretto, basing it on an 1892 novella of the same name by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, an early feminist classic that tells of a woman forbidden to work as a cure for her depression who becomes obsessed with the wallpaper in a room.
