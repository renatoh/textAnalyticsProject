Half an hour past the appointed time, Freddie Ljungberg strolled into the press room at London Colney and took a seat in the chair his mentor occupied for more than two decades. The softly spoken Swede has been thrust into the spotlight after replacing Unai Emery as Arsenal\u2019s head coach, at least on an interim basis, and it must have seemed surreal even for one of the heroes of the club\u2019s 2004 Invincibles side. \u201cI do my job \u2013 I don\u2019t try to seek the spotlight; that\u2019s not my way,\u201d Ljungberg said as he prepared for Thursday\u2019s game against Brighton at the Emirates Stadium. \u201cOf course, when I played we did press conferences so that\u2019s normal. But what I prefer, what I love to do, is to be on the football pitch, but this is part of the job as well.\u201d It has been a rapid rise for the 42-year-old, who has spent most of his coaching career with the club\u2019s youth teams and was promoted to work with the first team only last summer. The chaotic 2-2 draw at Norwich in his opening match on Sunday, which extended Arsenal\u2019s winless run to eight matches, laid bare the sizeable task facing Ljungberg, who received positive feedback after his request to consult the man who spent 22 years as the club\u2019s manager. \u201cIf he has that need, then of course I will be available,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cFreddie is fantastic and committed and will want to do this job for a long time. He has an opportunity and what you want in life is that opportunity. Let\u2019s get him to work with his ideas and support him.\u201d However, Ljungberg knows he may not have long to make his mark. With the technical director, Edu, the head of football, Raul Sanllehi, and the managing director, Vinai Venkatesham, continuing their search for a long-term replacement, his first home game is a chance to provide some positivity in a season that has been spiralling out of control. His emphasis on fixing Arsenal\u2019s tendency to be caught out by quick transitions at least indicates an awareness of one of the team\u2019s weaknesses, although time is of the essence. \u201cIt would be great if it was a game Saturday to Saturday and we had a few training sessions to keep on working with things,\u201d said Ljungberg. \u201cBut we do as well as we can \u2013 that\u2019s going to be an ongoing thing that we are going to work on, depending on whether I am here for a long time or a short time. We have a lot of quality but that\u2019s one thing we need to fix asap.\u201d As well as planning to pick Wenger\u2019s brains, Ljungberg has spoken to several members of the coaching staff in the past few days in an attempt to plan a way forward. \u201cI try to be calm and composed and break down the points I think are important,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to get some information from people who are extremely experienced in how to simplify things and get things done in a clear way in just a few days.\u201d Solving the enigma that is Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 is among his priorities. The \u00a372m record signing has not started in the Premier League since the draw against Crystal Palace in October but Ljungberg denied the forward was suffering from a lack of confidence. \u201cNico is someone who is a very, very good player but sometimes when you come from a different league it takes time to adapt; off the pitch and on the pitch. But Nico is someone I plan on talking to. I\u2019m going to have a little chat with him about what I expect and how I want to play.\u201d Ljungberg played down his chances of being involved in discussions over potential targets in the January transfer window but acknowledged that, like all managers, results would dictate his future. \u201cAt the moment I\u2019m just looking at the next game,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t look at the transfer window. If I\u2019m there at that time then maybe that\u2019s a discussion to be had, but at the moment I\u2019m here on a game-to-game basis and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to fix.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
