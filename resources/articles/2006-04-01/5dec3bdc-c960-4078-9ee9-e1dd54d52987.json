United will reduce the gap at the top of the Premiership to four points by beating Sunderland at Old Trafford tonight and Ferguson will then be looking for Bolton Wanderers to do him a favour when Chelsea visit the Reebok Stadium tomorrow. The comeback is far from complete but United have gone from being 18 points behind 38 days ago to seven points adrift with five games to go, including a visit to Stamford Bridge on April 29. Ferguson is entitled to expect a comfortable victory over Sunderland, whose relegation will probably be sealed, but it is his confidence in Bolton that shone through during an appearance before the television cameras which seemed designed to unnerve Jose Mourinho's players. \"We are over the biggest hurdle with our win over Arsenal and if we do our job against Sunderland we will go four points behind Chelsea and we all know that Bolton is not an easy place for them to go to,\" he said. \"We were the first team to score two goals at the Reebok this season [they won 2-1 on April 1] and we had to play really well to get that type of result. So I'm hopeful, really hopeful, that Bolton can do us a turn. \"It's a difficult game for Chelsea and people will probably be half expecting it to be a draw. If that happens, or if Bolton win, it will be a massive turnaround in the championship race and when we go to Stamford Bridge it will be the league decider. Chelsea know we're on their shoulder - it's probably as close as anyone has been to them - and they know if they do slip up we're going to take our chance.\" Bolton, seventh in the Premiership, have lost their last four games but Ferguson prefers to remember Sam Allardyce's team making a critical contribution to their last league title, three years ago, by pegging back Arsenal to a 2-2 draw during the period in which United's manager added \"squeaky-bum time\" to the football lexicon. \"We played Tottenham the next day, won 2-0 and that more or less put us in the driving seat. So Bolton have done us a favour before and hopefully they can do it again. They still have an outside chance of reaching the Champions League and a good chance of being in the Uefa Cup, so they have everything to play for. Sam has worked hard on getting his best out of his players and I think he will get his best out of them this weekend. They are honest players who play at a level that never disappoints. Are they really going to lose five games in a row? We'll see.\" Ferguson is so confident of making it 10 successive Premiership wins that he plans to field a weakened team, with several players rested before Monday's game at Tottenham. Louis Saha misses out after twisting his ankle, Ruud van Nistelrooy retaining his place in a match in which United's forwards will be under orders to peg back another of Chelsea's advantages. \"There won't be anything taken for granted but, frankly, I think we are playing too well to slip up,\" said Ferguson. \"We're the form team in the league and the area in which we must now pay attention is improving our goal difference. At the moment we are eight goals behind Chelsea, so we might have to do something about that. When we look back at the recent games at home to Birmingham and Newcastle and the chances we missed we just hope we don't live to regret them.\" The last time Bolton did United a favour April 26 2003: Bolton 2 - 2 Arsenal Djorkaeff 74, Keown 84og Wiltord 47, Pires 56 Arsenal travelled to Bolton three points behind United but with a game in hand. Sylvain Wiltord and Robert Pires scored twice in nine minutes just after half-time but Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side threw away two points as Youri Djorkaeff pulled one back and Martin Keown scored an own-goal with six minutes remaining. The result meant that the Gunners' eight-point lead had turned into a two-point deficit in seven weeks. Wenger, however, said after the game that suggestions his team couldn't cope with the pressure was \"rubbish\". What happened next United took full advantage of Arsenal's slip-up and won 2-0 against Tottenham the following day before a fraught Arsenal side virtually conceded the title by losing 3-2 at home to Leeds in their next game. United finished strongly, collecting 12 points from their last four games to win the title, five points ahead of Arsenal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
