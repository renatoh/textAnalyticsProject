The remarkable appearance of the long-tailed blue, a butterfly happiest in the heat of Africa or Australia, raises a mystery: will these insects simply die this winter? Until recently, the long-tailed blue, or Lampides boeticus, very occasionally arrived in hot summers: notably in 1945, and 1990 when it pitched up in Gillespie Park, north London. In 2013, however, there was an unprecedented invasion. Summer arrivals laid eggs on everlasting peas (ironically a garden plant gone wild, imported from Italy) and in October offspring emerged: 109 were counted. This year it\u2019s happened again. But the emergence of a British born generation has been delayed by the gloomy autumn. If it stays mild and the rain stops, more could yet hatch. Why this sudden influx? Neil Hulme, of Butterfly Conservation, says: \u201cMy suspicion is its zone of permanent residency has moved northwards through Europe because of climate change and we are now in strikingdistance.\u201d He believes this dynamic little flyer (it ascends into the Himalayas) will become a regular migrant, like the painted lady. For 45 years, he says, he never saw a long-tailed blue, and now he\u2019s seen 50 in three summers. \u201cIt\u2019s unthinkable that one person could have seen 50 long-tailed blues in Britain five years ago.\u201d But is Britain a dead end? Do the long-tailed blue\u2019s offspring perish in winter? Hulme is convinced that British born long-tailed blues make a reverse migration, just like other migratory butterflies \u2013 heading south through Europe to escape our fatal frosts. \u201cThe evidence is circumstantial but it\u2019s overwhelmingly in favour of their migrating back south, like painted ladies do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
