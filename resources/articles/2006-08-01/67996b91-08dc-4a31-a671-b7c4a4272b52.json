Although I don't have sensitive skin, I do seem to be allergic to DHA. I have tried all kinds of fake tans, from expensive ones and salon sprays to cheap and cheerful ones from my local chemist. They all have more or less the same effect - an excruciatingly itchy rash. Please help. I'm 41 and don't want to have to resort to using sunbeds! Kathryn Crease Please don't use sun beds - they are not only ageing but dangerous. I have looked into all the organic tan lotions and creams and they do, sadly, contain DHA. You could try REN's new Tan Enhancing Aftersun Cream, \u00a321.50 (www.renskincare.com; stockists: 0845 225 5600) which contains bio-actives to boost melanocytes but no DHA and which will give your skin some colour. You could also try beta-carotene tablets. Holland &amp; Barrett's Tan Tablets contain an amino acid called L-Tyrosine which encourages the production of skin pigmentation (darkening) and so speeds up tanning. Sixty tablets cost \u00a33.99 (www.hollandandbarrett.com; stockists: 0870 606 6605). Or Imedeen Tan Optimiser capsules, which claim that the interaction between the natural ingredients of palm fruit extract, lycopene, vitamin C and vitamin E increases the production of melanin, the pigment in the skin that protects the body from ultraviolet rays. The capsules sell at \u00a337.50 for a box of 60 (www.imedeen.co.uk; stockists: 0870 118 8070). Lastly, there are Thalgo Ocean Sun tablets, \u00a321 for 60 capsules (from Harrods, or mail order on 020 7512 0872). None of these have DHA and I can't promise you a Baywatch tan but you will get some colour without the problems. Several years back there was a lot of brouhaha about a pill that would tan your skin without you needing to be in the sun. I swear the release date was 2006. Was I dreaming? Lorna Thomopoulos You may be thinking about Melanotan which is being developed by Epitan, an Australian company. They are trying to develop a pellet that releases the drug into your system over 30 days. They say that one dose could give you an all-over tan lasting for months. It's not all about vanity either. The hope is that the drug - a synthetic form of a naturally occurring hormone called alpha melanocyte - will also protect against sunburn. I'm afraid it's still in the trial stage so you can't get it yet - but you can read more on www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=6182. I would like to find a fake tan that won't streak. I've used fake tans for years and have tried everything - out of a bottle, spray, wipes, etcetera. My body and face look fine; it is my legs that come out looking orange and streaky. I exfoliate beforehand, use lots of body lotion on my legs (which are very smooth), and am careful about not putting too much fake tan on. I'm still streaky. I even went to a Clarins studio and came out streaky. Are there any foolproof products? I've tried most of them, including the new body lotions with a hint of tan such as Johnson's and Dove (which will streak) and find that in colour, Piz Buin is probably the best for me (I'm pale and don't want a tan that's deep orange). Please help. I can't wear a skirt with tights in this weather. Tess, Newcastle upon Tyne I see the word Newcastle in your email and I think of those pale northern skins which are so unsuited to the sun - and fake tan, too. Having just spent quite a bit of time in the Far East where they are desperate to get whiter and paler all the time, it seems mad that we are always trying to look orange. However, the queen of fake tan, Judy Naake, of St Tropez, says that you might be diluting the product with too much body lotion or you've burned your legs in the past so the skin is uneven. Her advice is to use the original St Tropez (my favourite, too) not the mousse, and to put moisturiser only on your knees and the backs of your heels. 'Put a good teaspoonful of St Tropez on and rub it in until it's creamy,' she says. 'Slide it over the knees and use more for the tops of the legs. Do not worry if it looks brown and streaky, only if there are white streaks, in which case apply more to make sure everything is covered. It might look scary - don't panic. The only place to moisturise a little now is your feet. Then leave it overnight or for at least four hours before showering off.' Judy says that if this goes wrong, she will personally sort you out. So let me know. St Tropez Auto-Bronzant, \u00a318 for 120ml (stockists: 0115 983 6363). I am recovering from a bout of depression and would like to improve my self-confidence. What one thing would you recommend that would give me an instant lift? Katherine M Higley The smallest thing can make a big difference. I have a friend who goes off to have her hair professionally blow-dried. Another indulgence is a good massage - there is therapy in being touched and pampered. Lastly, I suggest starting a regular exercise class. A dynamic (ie Ashtanga) yoga class, spinning or aerobics - anything that gets those endorphins going. Endorphins are peptides produced by the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus which produce analgesia and a sense of wellbeing. I hope it works for you. Kathy's hot product of the month Marcia Kilgore gave us the Bliss brand and spas and made her own fortune. Now she has dreamt up another brand - Soap and Glory - which launches first in Harvey Nichols and next month in branches of Boots. Fixated by the latest miracle ingredients and formulations, what Marcia produces will always be innovative and covetable but her new buzz words are 'affordable and fun'. Soap and Glory believes that you shouldn't have to spend an arm and a leg to moisturise one! (Her joke.) You have to have it. \u00b7 Kathy Phillips is beauty director of Cond\u00e9 Nast Asia.
