Spare a thought, then, for Lorde, whose plans for her new album appear to have been derailed while she goes into mourning for her pet dog. The New Zealand singer-songwriter had been working on her highly anticipated follow-up to 2017\u2019s hit Melodrama when her beloved dog, Pearl, died suddenly. \u201cPearl came into my life in 2018, and almost immediately changed everything for me,\u201d Lorde wrote in a note to fans. \u201cAs anyone who has had the pleasure of raising a dog can understand, my life grew exponentially. Pearl brought an immeasurable amount of joy and purpose into my world.\u201d In the note, she described how the two of them had been inseparable: \u201cWe spent almost all our time alone together, him asleep under the piano as I played, or on the porch together, or in the park, where he became a blurry speck of gold in the green, far away.\u201d Pearl, who was adopted by Lorde last year, had suffered various illnesses throughout his life, and the singer had been working with vets to pinpoint the issue. \u201cEverything was looking good,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut one day we woke up and I knew, in that way mothers do, that he was sicker than we had realised, and that we were nearing a point where his body wasn\u2019t going to be able to cope. I rushed him to the specialists. Pearl had two cardiac arrests about an hour apart, and after the second one, he died. I was holding him when he went, and I know he knew that I was there.\u201d Lorde said Pearl\u2019s death had been \u201cindescribably painful\u201d and had profoundly affected her. \u201cA light that was turned on for me has gone out,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe bright energy I was trying to communicate to you has gone, for now. He was instrumental to the discovery that was taking place. I felt he led me towards the ideas. And it\u2019s going to take some time and recalibration, now that there\u2019s no shepherd ahead of me, to see what the work is going to be.\u201d The singer asked for fans\u2019 patience as the album, which she had announced was \u201cin the oven\u201d in June this year, looks to be postponed indefinitely \u2013 albeit not forever. \u201cAs anyone who has felt loss can understand, there\u2019s a door that opens that you step through, and everything is different on the other side. But when this great loss crystallises inside me, and my chest rebuilds around it, hopefully I\u2019ll be able to finish up, and share it with you, and we\u2019ll all grow together, as we always do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
