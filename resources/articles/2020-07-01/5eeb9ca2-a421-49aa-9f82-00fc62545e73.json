Ending overfishing and allowing stocks to recover while ensuring fish farms operate on a sustainable basis would generate benefits of about $6.7tn (\u00a35.3tn) over the next 30 years, according to an assessment of ocean economics by the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy. This would require reforming perverse subsidies that encourage overfishing, and better regulation of fish farming, but the returns on such investment would repay the outlay 10 times over, the report says. Mangrove restoration on tropical coastlines offers a quick way to generate jobs in seeding and planting, and returns of about $3 for every $1 spent, in the form of more productive fisheries as well as storm protection. The costs of offshore wind energy generation have plummeted in recent years, making clean energy generation at sea a viable prospect for many countries for the first time. The UK has long been a pioneer in the field, but many other countries have been slow to take it up. The report found that the technology has matured so quickly that investors can generate returns of up to $17 on each $1 spent, opening up a potential bonanza globally of $3.5tn by 2050 if governments put the right conditions in place. Ngedikes Olai Uludong, Palau\u2019s ambassador to the UN and one of the panel members, said offshore wind energy could spell an explosion in highly skilled green jobs. \u201cTechnologies like offshore wind offer a rate of return that makes more and more sense,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cIt looks like it is taking off. I\u2019m seeing interest from countries that I\u2019ve never seen interested before.\u201d She said countries were also increasingly willing to look at a nature-based recovery in their quest to \u201cbuild back better\u201d from the coronavirus crisis. Coastal states should urgently look at reforming their commercial fisheries to put them on a long-term sustainable basis, she said, which could reduce their expenditure on imports as well as generating income. Decarbonising international shipping is another key concern, and the switch to cleaner fuels could save money in the longer term, with a return of between $2 and $5 on every $1 spent in the next three decades, the report\u2019s authors found. The report will be published on Tuesday. The panel is made up of 14 serving world leaders, co-chaired by Norway and Palau, and is supported by the UN."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
