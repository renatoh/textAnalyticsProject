Roma, of course, or so go the words of Antonello Venditti's 1983 mega-hit (well, it was in Rome) Grazie Roma. Roma fans have had precious few chances to ring out Venditti's evocative ditty in the last few seasons but they were back in full voice on Sunday night, taking to the streets of the capital with klaxons blaring and climbing on buses to celebrate their club's greatest moment since the title of 2001. All this fuss was about the Rome derby. And rightly so: with a 2-0 win over Lazio, Roma had become the first Italian side ever to record eleven straight league victories. Admittedly the Premiership saw Arsenal manage 13 (go on then, 14) back in 2001 but Roma's run is at least as impressive, coming as it does despite a run of injuries that robbed them first of all their centre-forwards, then of their captain and talisman Francesco Totti. What's more, the record 11th win came against their neighbours and biggest rivals, hitherto unbeaten at the Olimpico. No wonder Roma's players went crazy at the final whistle, weeping and donning matching Totti jerseys. No wonder thousands took to the streets in Rome's fiercely romanista Testaccio quarter, where the club was born. No wonder grown men embraced and cried, despite being complete strangers. \"Perhaps we all went a bit over the top,\" admitted Roma's midfield powerhouse Simone Perotta afterwards, \"but you'd need to play for Lazio or Roma to understand. Winning the derby is huge. And then with the record thrown in, and the fact we were without Totti ... it was like winning the cup or something.\" Depends which cup, I'd say - and Totti was hardly missing: Er Pupone spent the evening seated as a living shrine just along from the Roma bench, surrounded by a throng of admirers and visited by regular pilgrimages from goal-scorers and other players alike. Here he watched Lazio's blistering start fizzle out after Rodrigo Taddei's goal after 30 mins, when the Brazilian lost his marker to head in Mancini's corner. Here - while a banner in Roma's Curva Sud announced 'even with one good leg you could beat this shower' - he rose to his feet as, 15 minutes into the second half, Mancini dazzled the Lazio defence with a series of penalty box step-overs before passing back to Alberto Aquilani, who dutifully nailed the match by delivering a hammer blow past Angelo Peruzzi. In fact, \"Totti's impact on the game was huge, much bigger than, say, Paolo Di Canio managed on the actual pitch,\" observed La Repubblica the next day. Paolo ended what could be his last Rome derby by being substituted in the 67th minute. But reports claim he's now considering extending his Lazio deal after all, just to get two more cracks at Roma. Totti, meanwhile, is living la dolce vita. \"I've never felt such joy,\" explained the Roma skipper on Sunday. \"We are a band of brothers, proud to be Romans and Romanisti.\" Even his TV presenter wife's right breast popping out live on Italian television the next day couldn't spoil the mood. Although on reviewing the pictures, why would it? Meantime readers, Totti and his totty's tit aside, anyone saddened to have missed Sunday's spectacle at the Stadio Olimpico will be delighted to know there could be another one along very shortly. Because this coming weekend the Giallorossi will be bidding for win No12 at home to Inter. Inter are a) the team directly above Roma in third and b) a side the Giallorossi have already beaten in a 3-2 thriller up at the San Siro. Admittedly that win was inspired by a piece of skill from their now-injured skipper that was later voted goal of 2005 by Serie A's players (Totti pelts down wing, hurdles two tackles, drifts back inside and chips the keeper). Though he won't be on the field this Sunday, Totti has already promised he'll be back receiving touchline visitations beside the bench. Look out Inter, then, and the buses of Testaccio, too. Roma v Inter (Bravo, Sunday 7pm) stacks up as the big match of round 28 after a weekend that saw all the top five win. Other games to keep an eye on include Milan going for their fifth straight win (hey, you've got to start somewhere) at home to third-from-last Empoli, and Juve's visit to Sampdoria. Former top four challengers Samp have won just one match in their last seven, and with consecutive defeats in their last two games to minnows Ascoli and Siena you can't help but wonder if the team aren't perhaps playing to earn their manager Walter Novellino a spell of rest at home. After all, his clashes with key Samp players are well known. Still, the Genovese club come alive when faced by big opponents, as their hammerings of both Milan and Fiorentina at home this season testify, so is it too farfetched to wonder whether, come next week, Juve's lead at the top might be a little slimmer? Whether, in short, Totti's Old Lady won't be the only one having a slip up top on live TV? See you back here next week, readers, for all the thrilling details.
