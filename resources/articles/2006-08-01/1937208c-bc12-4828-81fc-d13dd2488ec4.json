There has been a relaxation in the rules regarding trainers being fined for withdrawing their horses since the introduction of 48-hour declarations at the start of the month, but BHB communications executive Will Lambe feels the Haydock situation could just as easily have come about under the old system. \"There is an acceptance that non- runners will increase with 48-hour declarations,\" said Lambe. \"But the sport made a collective decision to go ahead with it, and already the benefits are being seen with regional newspapers re-introducing racecards. One summer is not long enough to strike the deals that will bring in revenue from selling rights abroad, but in time the money will come in. \"Rest assured, we are keeping a close eye on the amount of non-runners,\" added Lambe. \"But the benefits of the new system will ultimately outweigh any disadvantages. The bookmakers have said it helps them, and it gives owners an extra day to know what's happening. As we saw at Haydock, ground conditions can alter quickly, but there might well have been the same outcome with 24-hour declarations.\" From Thursday morning, when trainers had to declare for Saturday's card, to race-day itself, the Haydock track quickened up markedly under a drying wind. Alan Swinbank, the trainer responsible for one of the highest-profile withdrawals, Formal Decree, has no axe to grind with 48-hour declarations but admitted he \"would probably not have declared Formal Decree\" under the old system. \"Haydock did what they could and it's not their fault,\" said Swinbank yesterday. \"But by the end of racing on Friday my jockey Dean McKeown said it had firmed up a lot. He walked the course on Saturday morning and we decided it was best to pull him out. Formal Decree's a bloody nice horse and we could have damaged him. Under the old way, with no rain about on Friday morning, I probably wouldn't have declared him. But I'm not for, or against, 48-hour declarations. If there's revenue to come for racing, we just have to get on with it.\" Referring to the change in the rule, which enables a trainer to escape a fine for withdrawal without the horse having travelled to the course, Paul Struthers, public relations manager for the Horseracing Regulatory Board, said: \"If it isn't working, or gets abused, we will simply go back to the old method.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
