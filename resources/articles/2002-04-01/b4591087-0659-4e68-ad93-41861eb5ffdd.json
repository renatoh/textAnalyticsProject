Thierry Henry ran from the halfway line to slot them ahead after 16 minutes and Dennis Bergkamp set up Freddie Ljungberg for a simple second five minutes later. Ljungberg did the same for Henry to make it 3-0 in the 25th minute and Arsenal cruised to the top of the league. Derby County 0 - 1 Middlesbrough Derby are running out of games and a second defeat, after a limp performance, in three days has left them in dire danger, still three points adrift of safety. Robbie Mustoe got the only goal after 12 minutes to give Middlesbrough a deserved victory. Everton 3 - 1 Bolton Wanderers Everton picked up the three points that should ensure their safety in an action-packed relegation duel. Duncan Ferguson, newly-installed as Everton captain, was sent off for punching Fredi Bobic after 20 minutes but the numbers were levelled after half an hour when Greece defender Kostas Konstantinidis saw red for his second booking. Alessandro Pistone rocketed Everton ahead four minutes before the break, striker Tomasz Radzinski was then guilty of one of the misses of the season early in the second half but made up for it in the 57th minute with the second goal. Rod Wallace and Ricardo Gardner both hit the woodwork within a minute later on for Bolton but, although Bruno N'Gotty was on target with a header after 75 minutes, youngster Nick Chadwick settled it with his first goal for Everton four minutes from time. Fulham 0 - 1 West Ham United Fulham remain in relegation danger after their seventh defeat in eight games. Freddie Kanoute's well-placed header in first-half injury time settled it for the Hammers. Ipswich Town 0 - 0 Chelsea Ipswich produced a battling display but a point will probably not be enough to save them from the drop with games against the top three still to come. Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini made a brilliant save from a Marcus Bent penalty on 35 minutes, but the draw was a missed opportunity for Chelsea, who would have gone fourth with a win. Sunderland 2 -1 Leicester City Claudio Reyna volleyed Sunderland ahead after just three minutes, Paul Dickov equalised in the ninth minute but Reyna restored the lead in the 18th. Sunderland became increasingly nervous in the second half but did enough to secure the victory that should keep them up. Tottenham Hotspur 2 - 1 Leeds United A second successive defeat for Leeds not only ended their Champions League hopes but also left them fighting for a Uefa Cup place. Steffen Iversen headed Tottenham into the lead after 10 minutes and Teddy Sheringham poked in the second after half an hour as Spurs made all the early running. Mark Viduka pulled one back seven minutes into the second half with a fierce low shot but Spurs held out for all three points."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
