Yet not everyone is a personality \u2013 defined as a person whose qualities make them interesting and popular. The BBC Sports Personality of the Year award helps to perpetuate this confusion. The award goes to a personality, while never saying what that is. Some, cruelly, may think this just as well, given that Nigel Mansell, Greg Rusedski and Princess Anne are among past winners. When it was first awarded in 1954, the only qualification was to have appeared on the Sportsview programme. Nowadays the winner is the sports person \"whose actions have most captured the public's imagination\". That is not necessarily the same as having or being a personality, but it explains why this Olympic-year contest was so engaging. It would be a lot simpler if the award was for achievement or popularity. But if the award was really for personality then Nicola Adams or Ellie Simmonds would have been the only contenders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
