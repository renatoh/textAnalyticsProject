The education secretary, Charles Clarke, told MPs yesterday that there was no question of using the cards to check on the immigration status of children joining a school to see if they were entitled to free education. Mr Clarke told the Commons home affairs select committee that he saw some uses for an ID card scheme in students gaining access to post-16 education and student loans. \"We do not see these [identity cards] having any major contribution to under-16 education,\" the education secretary said. Headteachers had feared that ID cards might be used to prevent the children of illegal migrants going to state school in Britain but Mr Clarke made clear that the current law included a legal obligation on the state to educate all children over the age of five. \"We have no plans to alter that,\" Mr Clarke said. \"This is not an entitlement card. It is an identity card.\" The Department of Work and Pensions minister Chris Pond also admitted to MPs that an ID card scheme might curb only \u00a390m to \u00a3100m a year of the annual \u00a32bn a year social security fraud bill. But he said 4,500 identity card \"readers\" would have to be installed in jobcentres alone at an unknown cost to carry out the necessary identity checks. The select committee also heard health ministers say they intended ID checks to be carried out when new patients registered with GPs and attended outpatients clinics at hospitals when the scheme becomes compulsory. The committee's chairman, John Denham, also questioned the national statistician, Len Cook, on why he was proposing to set up a second national population register - the citizen's information project - alongside the national identity card register. Mr Clarke proclaimed himself to be a \"keen supporter of ID cards\" but it is clear that his support has been at the price of ensuring that it has nothing to do with access to schools. The result has been to undermine the home secretary's long-held hopes of developing the scheme as a \"citizenship entitlement card\" which gives access to a wide range of public services. The main public services that identity cards will eventually be essential to access now appear to be limited to the health service - except accident and emergency - and social security benefits. The health minister, John Hutton, said yesterday he was keen to have ID card checks for access to GPs services, especially as his department was considering the introduction of charges, to be announced in the next few weeks, for overseas patients not entitled to free NHS healthcare. He said they would also be used to check on those starting treatment in hospital outpatient clinics and would also be needed for periodic checks at key points in a patient's treatment. He said they were not going to start chasing people into operating theatres to check their identity cards but he saw nothing wrong in carrying out identity checks to ensure that those who were not entitled to free NHS services paid for them. \"What we are not going to do is have an endless waving of cards when everybody goes to the doctor's for a community nurse to change a dressing,\" he said. \"That would be over the top.\" Mr Hutton said he did not envisage doctors' receptionists or practice nurses carrying out identity checks but primary healthcare trusts would need to do them when a new patient registered and for periodic checks thereafter. He said this was particularly important as the government was proposing the introduction of charges for GP services to overseas patients who were not entitled to free NHS care."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
