It is the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games and it is, in truth, starting to slow as the competing countries, all 202 of them, are called into the arena, one by one and in three languages. It's like a monster Eurovision Song Contest, only with slightly less cheesy pop and with a hideous collection of bright blazers and white boaters. The countries file in, waving and grinning and filming themselves, in alphabetical order. (That's filing into the stadium in alphabetical order, incidentally; not filming themselves in alphabetical order, ankle first, then belly, then calf.) Only they don't, not exactly - not as we, a bunch of English philistines, know it. St Lucia, not Afghanistan or Albania, lead the way because \"saint\" in Greek starts with an \"A\" (alpha), and now they're waiting, squeezed in, bored - it's going to be three long hours before they escape, and not just for them. We're passing the time betting on who'll be last - Zimbabwe having by now already gone. Tom seems to have hit the jackpot. \"The last letter of the Greek alphabet is omega,\" he says. \"I reckon it's going to be Oman.\" The bastard. The logic leaves me defeated. I try to think of other omegas and, my head hurting, can only come up with \"orang-utan\"; the long wait feels longer, although it is punctuated by a roar for Iraq and Palestine and a huge cheer for the single, Weeble-like athlete from Djibouti who, waddling round the track with a flag reaching from her waist to the sky, looks touched, if embarrassed. Both hands gripping hard on the flag, she can't even wave back. Oman also appear, well before the end, which is a relief. And although I still can't work out where Finland are, it dawns on us, \"H\" (eta) for Hellas having passed with Hungary and Haiti arriving on cue, that the Greeks are saving the best until last. Themselves. It becomes a countdown to their arrival (just after, er, Hong Kong), the beautiful, spotless stadium erupting as they, in far greater numbers than anyone else, step into view. Aided by literary challenges it may have been, but it was worth it. Athens' opening ceremony, for all the three-hour roll call wedged in the middle, was magnificent - even if it would have helped if I actually knew something about Greek mythology and history; if I had realised that the huge white blobs in the \"sea\" were the Ionian Islands; if I had understood the significance of the parading figures. Things might have worked better, too, had it not been for the crowd, which couldn't be trusted to play its part properly. Guided by Hi-de-Hi-style cheerleaders with those luminous lollies favoured by traffic police and Jedis, the bell and the light were supposed to be whipped out at specific times. But try telling that to a fidgeting, curious crowd - especially a Greek one that knows damn well who's coming in last. All that might have helped, it is true, but the opening ceremony was still stunning, with the sea ablaze with the Olympic rings (fortunately extinguished by the time the little waving boy in the boat arrived) and fireworks racing round the roof. Like the games so far, it was a pleasant surprise, too - I've always thought opening ceremonies were a bit rubbish. Not now. And, whatever the horror stories and sniping said, transport links are easy and quick, the food's not a rip-off, it doesn't feel like a sponsor-fest and the stadiums are finished. They're impressive, too. And, with detectors at every entry, safe - the only danger here is getting helped to death by the ridiculously obliging Athenians. Besides, there's that overpowering feeling that says \"I'm at the Olympic Games!\" I might be watching four people I've never heard of play badminton - and, truth be told, finding myself concerned mainly with the Canadian guy constantly patting his female partner on the bum with his racket - but the whole world is watching (well, sort of); I might be baking in the sun watching archery - archery - but I'm in the original Olympic stadium. I might be off to watch some toffs in stupid hats ride horses, but it's the Olympics, the real Olympics, where it's supposed to be. In Athens, above all, it's almost impossible not to be melted by that, by the ideal, by the feeling of being at the centre of something so huge, facile though that can sound. There is something genuinely humbling about watching the Olympic flame enter the stadium. And there is something even more humbling about watching an athlete reach out to light the torch only metres from you. Or at least there would be if I hadn't been fiddling with the bloody camera and missed it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
