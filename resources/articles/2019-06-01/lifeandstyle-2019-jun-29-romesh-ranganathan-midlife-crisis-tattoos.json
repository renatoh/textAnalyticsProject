And now he\u2019s learned to read", "bodyText": "I have, over the last few years, become obsessed with getting tattooed. It started shortly after the birth of our first son. My wife and I agreed we would both get the boy\u2019s name inked (classy, I know). I went ahead and did it, and then she bottled it \u2013 a betrayal for which I am yet to cash in my martyr points (see earlier column for an explanation of how martyr points work). I got another done when my second son was born, but am yet to get a tattoo for our youngest. The clock is ticking, because he is now learning to read, and will be upset when he discovers that, not only have I got his brothers\u2019 names, but also Richard Pryor, Nas, the Roots and the Transformers\u2019 Autobot logo before getting round to him. As part of a travel show I filmed for BBC Two last year, I visited Albania, where I met an ex-con who offered me a tattoo. I wasn\u2019t completely up to speed on the social etiquette of this situation, but I decided that if you are in a bunker with an ex-con and he suggests inking you, it is probably safer to accept and deal with the repercussions later. I loved Albania, so it didn\u2019t feel that big a deal to get its flag tattooed on my wrist. The producers of the show were slightly more worried, asking if my wife would be upset; but the truth is she is so unbothered by such things that I could get a swastika tattooed on my face and she would probably say, \u201cIt\u2019s better than the Autobot one.\u201d A few months after my Albania trip, I found myself in a restaurant with my family and the waiter told me that the manager would like a word. Moments later, a surly looking man emerged from the back of the restaurant. \u201cI saw your Albania show,\u201d he said. \u201cIs the tattoo real?\u201d I told him it was and he asked to see it. He looked upon the two-headed eagle and nodded. \u201cI am Albanian. You never have to pay for anything here, ever again.\u201d While it was great to have a meal for free, I certainly can\u2019t return. Either they will all assume I\u2019m back because I\u2019m a cheap bastard; or the manager won\u2019t be in, I\u2019ll try to pay with my wrist and they\u2019ll think that I\u2019m a cheap bastard. People often point out that my tattoos will look awful when I\u2019m old and wrinkly, failing to appreciate that all of me will look awful when I\u2019m old and wrinkly. And yet I won\u2019t care as I enjoy my later years with my wife, or the younger woman I have left her for. I will admit to being slightly embarrassed that I am getting tattoos relatively late in life. Tattoos are meant to be something you get in your 20s when you\u2019re actually worried about your appearance. Getting a sleeve at my age is a midlife crisis for the man who can\u2019t afford a sports car. Still, I have finally booked an appointment to get my youngest son\u2019s name tattooed on to my body. It will mean that I feel less nervous about being on holiday together, or getting out of the shower and him suddenly realising his name is missing. If that does happen, I will simply point to my wife\u2019s unblemished body as evidence that she doesn\u2019t really love any of them, at all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
