It emerged that the former Great Britain hooker had taken his own life and for the first time in the sport\u2019s history the welfare of players and the importance of their mental wellbeing had been brought into focus. Where a player turns at the end of his career is often overlooked but Ian Knott knows more than most how the impact of an enforced retirement can lead to mental health problems. It is those experiences, plus the legacy of Newton\u2019s death, that have helped create a movement that started in rugby league but has now spread across sport. State of Mind was founded in 2011, initially targeted at promoting mental health awareness in rugby league. Within months of its foundation Knott and the charity had joined forces \u2013 with the former Warrington and Leigh forward determined to ensure the current generation of players do not have to experience what he went through. \u201cI\u2019d had enough,\u201d he says. \u201cI was ready to take my own life.\u201d Knott\u2019s career ended suddenly in 2005, after a back injury that led to five operations and at one stage left him bed-ridden. Knott still has to use a morphine pump at times and walks with the assistance of a stick. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t drugged up \u2013 I was taking 40-odd tablets a day \u2013 I was screaming at my wife, who gave up her dream job to look after me.\u201d Knott continues: \u201cI was sick of being a burden. I got a box of tablets, a pint of water and some morphine and went upstairs. I took the tablets, drunk the water, but forgot the morphine. As I went back downstairs to get it, I saw pictures of my family and thought: \u2018What the hell am I doing?\u2019 I managed to get myself to hospital before the hardest thing of all: sitting in front of my wife and explaining what I\u2019d been going through with my mental health. Without my wife I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be.\u201d Rugby league, Knott says, was a very different game when he was playing. \u201cIf you told a coach you were struggling mentally, they\u2019d laugh at you.\u201d Now he is at the forefront of the code\u2019s mental health revolution with State of Mind. Knott gives four talks a month as an ambassador to those who may be in need and says there are professional players who have benefited. \u201cWe\u2019ve had messages from players saying they\u2019d take their own lives if it wasn\u2019t for the talks,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are nine or 10 people I know of within the game that have said that.\u201d State of Mind was initially aimed at Super League clubs but quickly grew to cater for the whole game. Seven years on from its foundation Knott and the charity now deal with far more than just one sport. \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken at Manchester United, other Premier League clubs and are even into places like schools and building sites,\u201d he says. \u201cLocal communities need help just as much \u2013 places like Whitehaven, St Helens, Leigh ... they\u2019re high on the list for suicide rates and they\u2019re all rugby league towns.\u201d On average, 84 men take their own lives every week in the UK but State of Mind continues to attempt to combat that harrowing statistic. The charity has Offload sessions across the north\u2011west on weekday nights, targeted at men in working\u2011class areas who might not otherwise have access to such facilities. For the 42-year-old Knott there is the personal satisfaction of giving something back, as well as helping promote rugby league\u2019s undoubted place at the forefront of mental health awareness in professional sport. \u201cYou look at what other sports are trying to do but they\u2019re miles behind State of Mind and rugby league,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I do these talks for 30 years and help to stop one person from committing suicide, I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
