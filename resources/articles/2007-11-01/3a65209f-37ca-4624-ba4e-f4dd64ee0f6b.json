The loss of Amstel, owned by Heineken, wiped an estimated 2.3m hectolitres off sales for SABMiller in its home market. The London-listed company said in March the setback would hit profits by about \u00a340m over two years. Heineken had been able to enforce the licence cancellation because SABMiller's 2005 takeover of the Colombian brewer Bavaria had triggered a change of ownership clause in the Amstel licence agreement. Amstel had accounted for 9% of beer sales in South Africa. Yesterday SABMiller insisted that the proposed acquisition of Grolsch, known for its swing-top bottles, was not just about plugging the gap in South African sales. Nick Fell, director of marketing, said northern European brands such as Grolsch, with almost 400 years of brewing heritage, were the most effective in developing a \"premium\" category of beers in emerging markets. \"It gives us a category opener in a bunch of markets, predominantly for us Latin America and Africa, where the premium space has yet really to be occupied and created by anybody.\" The proposed offer, which has been recommended by the Grolsch board, was priced at an 84% premium to the share price and 14.7 times historic earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The multiple is likely to be seized upon today by Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The Edinburgh-based brewer is due to issue a trading update, but will also be expected to give a further insight into its rejection of a 750p-a-share takeover offer from Heineken and Carlsberg. S&amp;N is likely to suggest the price achieved for Grolsch demonstrates the scarcity premium put on established western European brands in an already consolidated global beer market. Grolsch is the number-three brand in the Netherlands, behind Heineken and Amstel, with a market share of 15%. Dutch beer sales have been in decline in recent years, as they have in much of western Europe. Grolsch has a small business in the UK, which has seen better times. In the US, it has a partnership deal with SABMiller's arch-rival, Anheuser-Busch, which is unlikely to last. Anheuser, maker of Budweiser, had been rumoured as a possible alternative buyer for Grolsch. Asked about SABMiller's appetite for intervening in the battle over S&amp;N, Malcolm Wyman, finance director, declined to comment on the situation. He added that the group could still spend between $3bn (\u00a31.5bn) and $5bn and remain within \"comfortable\" financial limits. The Grolsch offer, which has the support of 37% of shareholders in the Dutch company, \"had no particular bearing on any other deal we may look at\", Wyman said. SABMiller is believed to have asked Morgan Stanley and Dresdner Kleinwort to help weigh up its options in relation to the Edinburgh brewer of Foster's, Newcastle Brown Ale and Baltika. One analyst said: \"SABMiller's extensive international distribution network will significantly improve the prospects for the Grolsch brand. It will be revenue rather than cost synergies that are the driver of this deal. \"Given the universal presence of the Heineken brand, we are confident that the Grolsch brand will find widespread acceptance throughout SABM's territories given the obvious similarities between the brands. In particular, the brand will help to fill the portfolio gap that the loss of the Amstel brand in South Africa represents.\" Shares in Grolsch closed up 76% at \u20ac47.25, just below the offer price. SABMiller ended the day down 38p at \u00a313.06."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
