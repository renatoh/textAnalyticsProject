It was not forthcoming when Severiano Ballesteros invited him to play in his Continental Europe side at Druids Glen. But money up front, at least as much as national pride, has lured the young maestro to this event in Gran Canaria. Ironically, the championship is promoted by Ballesteros's own Amen Corner organisation, although Garcia's appearance has no doubt been underwritten by the Canary Islands government. It is a shrewd investment, for only the world No1 Tiger Woods would be a bigger draw card than \"El Nino\" on Spanish soil. Ballesteros, whose team lost by three points in Ireland despite his second successive singles victory over the Britain and Ireland captain Colin Montgomerie, remains decidedly disenchanted with Garcia, despite having fought many an appearance-money battle of his own in times past. When told that the 22-year-old world No5 had denied demanding appearance money, declaring \"Seve maybe has to come and talk to me because some of the things he said were not correct\", Ballesteros retorted: \"I am the captain. He refused to play and he should give me an explanation. What I said was 100% correct. If he wants to play in the match next year and he qualifies I would welcome him.\" Along with the US Masters runner-up Retief Goosen, Garcia will be among the favourites for the \u00a3176,000 first prize on the new El Cortijo course. He lies fifth in the European money list behind Goosen and sixth in the US table and believes it is possible to top both. Ballesteros, though, plays down his own chances: \"Beating Monty in Ireland was very nice but I don't feel I played very well. I hit only three greens in regulation and one fairway.\" \u00b7 Royal Birkdale is to stage the Amateur Championship in 2005 for only the third time in its history, following 1946 and 1989.
