Diplomatically, he doesn\u2019t point fingers. \u201cOften it doesn\u2019t matter how much you bring to it; it\u2019s just going to become what it is. That\u2019s where being the director is a bit more interesting, because you can flush out the nuance and the detail.\u201d Set in 1970s Western Australia and shot in the coastal town of Denmark, Baker\u2019s flick hews closely to Winton\u2019s text. It follows Pikelet (Samson Coulter) and Loonie (Ben Spence) over a formative few years as they get taken in under the wing of the ageing surf legend Sando (Baker), and grow enraptured with Sando\u2019s troubled wife, Eva (Elizabeth Debicki). Coulter and Spence were both amateur actors selected for their surfing ability, captured stunningly by water cinematographer Rick Rifici. When Sando and Loonie head off on a surfing adventure without Pikelet, the teen finds comfort in Eva\u2019s bed. She later raises the stakes in a manner that gives grave meaning to the title, pulling out a pink plastic bag and strap for Pikelet to affix to her head. Having been written by Winton, the novel has plenty of local lingo \u2013 \u201cducks nuts\u201d gets a guernsey twice \u2013 and reflects warmly yet solemnly on the loss of innocence. It confronts male identity and has its protagonist reckon with a fear of ordinariness and a very confused sexual awakening. But in WA \u2013 where Winton lives and where nine of his texts are on the year 12 syllabus \u2013 Breath is known for one thing specifically: Eva\u2019s dangerous infatuation with breath play, a taboo act that requires Pikelet to strangle or suffocate her during sex. In the novel, Eva\u2019s asphyxiophilia \u2013 or arousal through oxygen deprivation \u2013 is written as an eye-watering blow-by-blow account, with Pikelet describing the \u201cevil, crinkly sound of the bag and the smeary film of her breath inside it\u201d. But for the film, Baker edited the sequences elliptically, not showing much at all. He put a number of other sex scenes aside, while toning down the ferocity with which Pikelet takes to his task. (\u201cI gently throttled her,\u201d remembers Pikelet, as an older man in Winton\u2019s book.) Baker spent a long time thinking about how he\u2019d approach the scenes. \u201cThere was a while there where I considered not even showing the bag over her head,\u201d he says, before describing the shot order in precise detail, to emphasise that the remaining \u201ctwo-second shot\u201d and the suggestive images that follow are \u201cfar more potent\u201d. \u201cIn the book, it really goes there in a lot of ways, because you can do that in a book,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about ratings, you don\u2019t have to worry about what\u2019s going to turn an audience off.\u201d By side-stepping the titular act, the film was awarded an M rating, which will mean it can still be studied in schools. \u201cWith the book, it\u2019s black ink on a white page, and you paint the picture and you join the dots yourself,\u201d Baker says. \u201cBut, on a 30-foot screen, it\u2019s there in front of you, and it can be far more confronting without a word spoken.\u201d Another omission in the film is the book\u2019s tragic prologue and epilogue, featuring an adult Pikelet \u2013 now a paramedic haunted by his past and present kinks \u2013 encountering not one but two deaths by autoerotic asphyxiation. Instead, Baker keeps Breath planted in the 1970s. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going to work in a film,\u201d he says of the excised chapters. \u201cI wanted to make a film that, when you watched it, it felt like you felt when you read the book, as opposed to a checklist of literal translation of what the book is to the film. It wouldn\u2019t make a good film if you just went through the book and put all the points down.\u201d The idea of adapting Breath first came to producer Mark Johnson, who thought of Baker for the character of Sando, based on his heritage, history and love of surfing. Baker\u2019s initial plan to simply produce alongside Johnson proved unsatisfying after he read the book and found himself ensnared. \u201cNormally, whenever I read anything that was related to surfing at all, I\u2019d run a mile from it, because it always \u2013 in script form \u2013 felt a bit corny or cheesy,\u201d he says. But after a few meetings with prospective directors, Johnson finally asked Baker if he was keen to take the helm: \u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask,\u201d Baker says with a laugh. Approaching the text, Baker was driven mostly by a fear of failing it. Like Pikelet, he was reckoning with the elemental fear of ordinariness. \u201c[Before production began] I got a bit terrified and started to consider backing out of it, pulling out of it or just letting it fade away,\u201d Baker admits. He confided in his wife, telling her: \u201cI\u2019m scared that I can\u2019t make the film the way I want to make the film; as good as I want it to be.\u201d \u201c[Winton\u2019s] book is intact as a beautiful piece of work,\u201d he says. \u201cI could come unstuck and make a terrible movie completely, but I just needed to know I was free to go and do that. [Winton] was completely accommodating. He completely understood and he said, \u2018you go mate, you go ahead and do it\u2019.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really proud of this movie and I still sort of pinch myself that we were able to pull it off at all. What I wanted to do with this movie [is] try to make a film that had a bit more longevity and, for my own personal satisfaction, [had] some kind of a legacy that I felt proud of.\u201d \u2022 Breath is in Australian cinemas now \u2022 This article was amended on 9 May 2018.
