The FIA, Formula One's governing body, has referred the case to its international tribunal for further investigation following a report from the stewards of the Monaco Grand Prix. It was at Monaco, during the last race weekend, that Red Bull and Ferrari lodged an official protest. The FIA has decided now that Mercedes \u2013 and Pirelli \u2013 have a case to answer. If found guilty Mercedes may face any one of a number of penalties including a hefty fine, a points deduction or even being thrown out of this year's championship, though that is extremely unlikely. Ferrari also had a test with Pirelli but in accordance with FIA rules they used a two-year-old car. Mercedes used their current 2013 model. News of the FIA's move broke as teams arrived in Montreal for this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix, the seventh round of the season. It could scarcely have come at a worse time for Mercedes. After years of under-achievement they have regrouped under the team principal, Ross Brawn, and have been inspired by the signing of Lewis Hamilton. But it is the resurgent form of Nico Rosberg which has transformed the team in recent weeks. Rosberg has taken the last three poles and won in Monaco, only his second victory in F1. The FIA statement read: \"The Monaco Grand Prix stewards raised in their report to the FIA an issue concerning a tyre-testing session carried out by Pirelli with the participation of Team Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 in Barcelona on 15-17 May 2013. \"The stewards' report follows the protests made by Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Ferrari Team on the occasion of the Monaco Grand Prix against Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 concerning its participation in the Barcelona tests (15-17 May 2013). \"The FIA requested clarifications from Pirelli and Team Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 in this respect. The FIA also asked questions to Scuderia Ferrari Team, which took part in a tyre-testing with Pirelli in Barcelona on 23-24 April 2013. \"The FIA requested all the other F1 teams to provide the FIA with information they may have regarding any tests carried out by Pirelli during the 2013 season. \"In the light of all the replies received and in view of the information gathered the president of the FIA, acting as the FIA prosecuting body, has decided: \"To close the case as regard to Scuderia Ferrari team considering that its participation in a tyre testing organised by Pirelli in Barcelona on 23-24 April 2013 using for this purpose a 2011 car is not deemed to contravene the applicable FIA rules. \"To bring the case concerning the tyre-testing session carried out by Pirelli and Team Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 in Barcelona on 15-17 May 2013 before the FIA international tribunal because it results from the inquiry that the conditions of this testing may constitute a breach of the applicable FIA rules. \"The FIA international tribunal is called upon to make a decision in compliance with the FIA judicial and disciplinary rules.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
