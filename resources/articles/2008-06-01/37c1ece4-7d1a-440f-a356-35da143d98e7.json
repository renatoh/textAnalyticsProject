But playground crazes have come on leaps and bounds. There has since been Tamagotchi, Scoubidou, Pok\u00e9mon ... and now, Gogo's Crazy Bones. These hard plastic figures in bright colours, each one with a Japanese-sounding name, have mysteriously invaded the nation's primary schools. No one can remember seeing any advertising for them. But by word of mouth, child to child, the craze has spread. Even more mysteriously, while one school may be gripped by bones fever, a neighbouring school can be untouched by it. According to the makers, Magic Box International, Crazy Bones were inspired by a game played in Ancient Greece, where children played with sheep's knucklebones. There are 90 of the little critters to collect (at 99p for a pack of three figures and six stickers) with the usual trail of associated merchandise from matching sticker books to \"special holders\". Unlike conkers, which just came with a bit of string. There are numerous captivating games to be played with the Gogo's, with rules typically impenetrable to adults: toss the characters into the air and get points for which side the figures land on. Or take turns in trying to knock down rows of your opponent's Crazy Bones. Or throw them as high as you can and then catch them. Brilliant. Noel Lellman, headteacher at Reigate Priory junior school in Surrey has seen countless playground crazes come and go. He points out their educational value. \"They tend to have incredibly complex rules that children pick up quickly. And collectibles always do really well. I'm a great believer in it though. There's some really deep learning going on.\" Year 3 student Samir has been collecting Crazy Bones for the last two months and now has 59. He lets me in on some of his secrets for success. \"The trick is to put your best figures out there. You need the figures with the biggest feet because they knock others down more easily.\" But with playground crazes there are always problems. Since one of his rare figures went missing, Samir leaves his best Gogo's at home. The school secretary at Reigate Priory has a pile of Gogo's on her desk that have parted company with their owners. \"When a new craze hits I always have to set up some ground rules,\" says Lellman. \"I don't allow swopsies. That always leads to trouble.\" And today, of course, playground crazes are not confined to the playground. A quick Google search reveals countless video footage of kids waging Crazy Bones war on one another. Sharon Watson from Winchester recently bought her five-year-old son a pack . \"I'd never heard of these lumps of plastic before, but when I took him to school there was a gaggle of boys in the playground playing with these Gogo's.\" Now the shops can't stock them fast enough. \"I've been searching toy shops for two days for these chuffing Crazy Bones,\" says mum-of-two Joanne Mallon from Brighton. \"The woman in Toys R Us actually lowered her voice to whisper details of somewhere that seems to have the last ones in East Sussex.\" Janet Murray Me and Amy get down with the kids It is just as well that for his English GCSE my older son did not do the version set by the exam board OCR. After all the parental nagging about revision, the sight of his father's name on the first question could well have tipped the poor lad over the edge. I had no idea that a piece I'd written three years ago, based on an interview with the best-selling author and former SAS man Andy McNab, had been chosen to test the nation's 16-year-olds on \"nonfiction, media and information\". Friends have been quick to draw a parallel with Amy Winehouse, whose lyrics were plundered for Cambridge University's final English exams. \"Fill me in on this Winehouse,\" I said to the kids. One daughter mentioned substances. The other said that the singer had once got cross when a TV interviewer asked if she wore hair extensions. I too get shirty if asked this question and yes, I also find the second sherry before Sunday lunch hard to resist. And now we are both featured on exams. Uncanny, or what? Naturally, I was curious to know the questions that OCR had put with my text. \"Illustrate the author's subtle use of zeugma\", perhaps, or \"Give three reasons why this is brilliant journalism ...\" Not quite. There was just one task for examinees. \"From this article, outline what Andy McNab was like before he joined the army and explain concisely how his army experience changed him.\" In other words, do what is known in the trade as a \"rewrite job\". To suffer this at work is bad enough. To have umpteen thousand teenagers publicly invited to do it? Well, OCR, that hurts! But it's nothing that a well-aimed case of good claret couldn't cure. Peter Kingston What we learned this week ... Our weekly round-up While some schools have far too many underachievers, some have so many brainboxes that universities can't cope. The schools secretary, Ed Balls, told us that 638 schools were \"failing\", which now means that fewer than 30% of their pupils get 5 A*-C GCSEs including English and maths. Some of the schools will be surprised, since they are working in difficult circumstances with disadvantaged students and Ofsted had said they were doing quite all right. In Kent, about 30 secondaries are \"low performers\". But Balls has spotted something: counties such as Kent that still have selection often have a high number of underperforming schools. It's quite a coincidence, isn't it? The government's answer? The \"failing\" schools (perhaps that should be the ones whose students \"failed\" the 11-plus) should be taken over by grammar schools. So ... does that mean we will end up with schools that are in effect grammars merged with secondary moderns? Sort of like a big comprehensive? It's quite brilliant in a way, but who knows how it will play in Tunbridge Wells. At the other end of the scale, universities are complaining that so many students get brilliant A-levels, they can no longer sort the sheep from the extra fine Merino wool sheep. Last week Imperial College's rector announced the development of a n exam to help the college pick only the brightest. This week there's more information, and it seems Imperial's not that good at spotting which Britons have got talent. Some apparent stars off ered a place are found upon arrival to need spoonfeeding with basic arithmetic and science. David Robb, a lecturer from the college, told MPs: \"Engineers have got to get things right. You can't say, 'This looks about right.' There are people's lives at stake. If you get the calculations wrong, engineers can kill.\" Robb also dealt a blow to the reputation of the new diplomas by explaining that Imperial won't be accepting those, thank you. Diplomas, A-levels, targets and paperwork: being a headteacher is a tough job, but the salaries are soaring. Academies were this week accused of creaming off the best professionals by off ering them \u00a3100,000 a year. Christine Blower, of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"It damages surrounding schools and there is anecdotal evidence of staff being headhunted for academies.\" Coming soon: the football-style headteacher agent, arrangement fee 10% of salary.
