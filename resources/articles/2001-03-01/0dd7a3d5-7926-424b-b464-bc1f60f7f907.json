He is 36, extremely good-looking, has just been given a chair in history at Oxford, and today publishes a voluminous history of money and power over three centuries, less than three years after his equally substantial revisionist history of the first world war. Ferguson received a \u00a3500,000 advance for a three-book deal with Penguin, yet this new book isn't even part of that. He had a year's sabbatical at the Bank of England and did the research there. Has he never heard of writer's block? Frankly, his apparent lack of suffering is insufferable. He greets me warmly in his immaculate room at Jesus College, Oxford, and abandons his humming laptop to make me coffee. He is beautifully dressed in perfectly tailored suit and mauve shirt. I can't help notice his matching mauve cufflinks. Now, I'm sorry, but it is a well-known fact that dons must wear baggy pullovers and corduroy jackets, preferably patched at the elbow. They should give tutorials while in the bath or perched on the branch of a tree, and publish occasional, esoteric articles on the prevalence of the Black Death in Bolton or Henry VIII's flute sonatas. How on earth did this fellow, with his gorgeous clothes, vast books, frequent forays into journalism and outrageous productivity, ever get in? The worst thing is, he is extremely likeable. I have come armed with a charge sheet - populist, kowtowing to publishers' love for ridiculously wide-ranging histories, rightwing, an uneasy union of historian and polemicist - but I'm not sure I can make it stick. He is polite, reasoned, fluent, clever and modest. He also makes very good coffee, and insists that we interrupt the interview so that his tutorial student gets her full hour on the Habsburgs. I am beginning to forgive him his precociousness, his prolific output, perhaps even his adoration of Lady Thatcher, though not the mauve cufflinks. I fearlessly put my case that his vast advance and large sales demonstrate the speciousness of his academic credentials. \"I'm a little wary of anyone who makes the argument that Ferguson is suspect because he publishes books that are read and discussed,\" he says. \"The idea that the media don is a modern invention is absurd. In many ways the separation of the public from the academic is the real novelty. In the 19th century if you were a historian, you might not necessarily be an academic. In fact, the best historians in this country weren't. Somebody like Carlyle never had a university post.\" But did Carlyle have mauve cufflinks and a half-million pound advance for Sartor Resartus? \"Envy is something you have to live with,\" says Ferguson, as if reading my thoughts. \"Compared with the editor of a newspaper, I don't earn that much. There is a tremendous ethic of scholarly poverty in British academic life, and it is funny how reluctant academics are to say 'we're not paid enough'. This is an issue that will become more and more crucial if British academic life is to survive in the international premier league, because if you really carry on with these ridiculous salaries the system is not going to be a very healthy one.\" Ferguson was born in Glasgow and produced his first book - home-made with a tinfoil cover - at the age of 10. (When I ask him how he can possibly produce so much, he looks as if the thought had never struck him: \"I get up in the morning and work. My puzzle is with people who spend 10 years not producing a book. What do they do?\") He was an undergraduate at Oxford and did his doctorate there, though it was completed after he had been given a research fellowship in Cambridge. This book was more to the taste of the cloistered critics. Called Paper and Iron: Hamburg Business and German Politics in the Era of Inflation 1897-1927, it was, says Ferguson, a triumph of Teutonic impenetrability. Ferguson returned to Oxford in 1992 and lived what he describes as a double life: working on a densely researched history of the Rothschilds, and writing articles for newspapers. He had been an active proponent of Thatcherism as an undergraduate and found a natural home at the Telegraph, but also wrote for the Mail, where he met the journalist Sue Douglas, whom he married in 1994. He continues to produce articles and reviews, but evidently has no sympathy for the post-Thatcher Tory party and considers himself politically \"stateless\". He is unrepentant both about his Thatcherite past and his polemical present. \"I disagreed with some of her policies but I don't regret supporting her. The only thing that's slightly boring is to end up being pigeonholed as a right-wing Thatcherite historian, because those sort of labels don't mean anything any more. The big issues that were at stake in the 1980s when I was an undergraduate - the cold war and the British economy - have been resolved. The Conservatives were right and the Labour party capitulated. To label someone a Thatcherite is just a term of abuse, but if the Blairites were honest, they would label themselves that too, because in most essentials that's what they are. \"I get bored with the assumption that everything can be understood in terms of a left-right dichotomy. Nineteenth-century politics wasn't like that. In the 19th century there were two critiques of liberal capitalism: one was socialist and the other was Conservative, and they had a great deal in common. So I would rather be seen as radical and revisionist. I'm interested in questioning received wisdom, whether it is from the left or the right.\" Ferguson's latest book, The Cash Nexus, emerged when he was awarded a year-long fellowship at the Bank of England. He had originally intended a history of the bond market, the anarchic nature of which bears out his chaos theory of history, but to the disappointment of the cloisters it has grown into an all-encompassing history of money, power and war. \"The idea was to address a series of questions,\" he explains. \"It is a rather Oxford or Cambridge style of writing, where you set yourself an exam and try to answer the questions. I like that kind of writing. I think history proceeds rather well through essays, because it is not the pursuit of the definitive; it's an argument. I am making arguments and making them on a very big canvas in this book.\" He still owes Penguin two books - one on European monarchy, the other on ethnic conflict - but his current preoccupation is a Schama-esque history of the British empire for Channel 4, which is sure to be controversial. \"The project appealed to me because the British empire is connected with The Pity of War, it's connected with The Cash Nexus; it is precisely about the relationship between economics and politics,\" he says. But don't we know what to expect, given his political views? \"I can imagine people saying: 'Ah, the dreaded Thatcherite Ferguson writes a great defence of empire,' \" he admits. \"But if that is the expectation I think they will be surprised. All attempts to categorise my work in political terms seem to me to fail. I don't think the way I approach the British empire will be some sort of jingoistic celebration of Kitchener's great victory at Omdurman.\" Despite his wealth and success, his wavy hair and worked-out life, I'm inclined to believe him. I just hope he doesn't wear those cufflinks for the walking shots in the Sudan. \u0095 The Cash Nexus: Money and Power in the Modern World 1700-2000 is published today by the Penguin Press (\u00a320)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
