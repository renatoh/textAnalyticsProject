The company is about to start the hunt for an investment bank to handle the move and hopes to make a decision on the timing of the proposed share listing during the first quarter of this year. The business was founded three years ago by chief executive David Andrews, one time head of outsourcing activities at Accenture, formerly Andersen Consulting. It is 70% owned by venture capitalist firm General Atlantic Partners which injected \u00a325m in October to help fund continued expansion. Mr Andrews and 50 senior executives hold the remaining 30% of the equity. Xchanging, which concentrates on the provision of human resources, accounting and administration services, is budgeting for turnover of \u00a3150m this year and expects to see that figure double to \u00a3300m by the end of 2003 with the hoped for award of further large contracts. The company is sitting on a forward order book worth \u00a31.6bn. Mr Andrews believes there is a good chance a float could take place during the coming year with the market said to be increasingly confident about the concept of business process outsourcing. Since its formation the company has secured big procurement and human resources contracts with BAe Systems and has established a joint venture claims processing operation with the Lloyd's of London insurance market. Further contracts - including a procurement contract for the building products concern Heywood Williams - are said to be on the cards, and the company is hoping to land at least two more large contracts next year to maintain the hoped for growth in turnover. The group, which employs 1,500 people, recently moved into profit and is looking for a 10% operating profit margin by next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
