On a stage divided along generational and ideological lines, the debate \u2013 the second over two days to accommodate the huge field of candidates vying for the Democratic nomination \u2013 saw Biden, who has dominated the early stages of the race, face off against the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. But the two veteran politicians were overshadowed by other strong performances, that highlighted policy rifts in the party, and posed the question of how aggressively the next president should push to transform the US economy, including on issues of healthcare and how much to tax the wealthiest Americans. The most dramatic moment of the evening came in response to a question about race and policing, when Harris interjected, saying that she had a right to respond as the only black candidate on stage. The California senator and former prosecutor then directed her comments to Biden, denouncing his record on race. \u201cI do not believe you are a racist,\u201d Harris said, looking directly at the former vice-president. \u201cBut,\u201d she continued, \u201cit is personal. And it was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.\u201d Her attack was a reference to a remark Biden made recently on the campaign trail in which he spoke fondly of his relationship with segregationist senators. When called on by his rivals to apologize, he refused. She accused Biden of supporting policies that would have prevented young minority students like herself from attending school in majority-white districts. She said when he opposed bussing, there was a little black girl in Oakland, California, who was being bussed to a better school. \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that little girl was me.\u201d Growing visibly upset, Biden looked away. \u201cThat is a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I did not praise racists. That is not true,\u201d he said. At the end of the exchange, Biden, looking defensive, pointed to his work as a public defender, noting that he chose that path, as opposed to Harris, who was a prosecutor. Then he abruptly stopped. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he told the moderators: \u201cMy time is up.\u201d After Harris laced into Biden, several more candidates leveled their own critiques. Senators Michael Bennet and Kirsten Gillibrand also went on the offensive, calling into question Biden\u2019s negotiating skills in the Senate, while Sanders seized on his vote in favor of the Iraq war. For the candidates on stage at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the second installment of back-to-back debates, the evening presented a national platform to present their pitch to be Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent in the 2020 election. It was a good night for South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has soared from near anonymity to near the top of the Democratic field, and was warmly received on the debate stage. Buttigieg, who is gay, spoke about his husband, Chasten, and their experiences of student debt. The debate represented the 37-year-old mayor\u2019s first national appearance since the killing of a black man by a South Bend police officer who had not turned on his body camera. Asked why a racial disparity persisted on the city\u2019s police force, Buttigieg admitted: \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t get it done.\u201d But, he continued: \u201cI am determined to bring about a day when a white person and a black person driving a vehicle feels the exact same thing when they see a policeman \u2013 a feeling of safety and not fear.\u201d Unlike the previous night, the candidates savaged Trump by name. Sanders called Trump a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who conned American workers and said the best way to beat Trump to \u201cexpose him for the fraud that he is\u201d. Trump, who was attending the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, found time to comment on the debate, criticizing the candidates for their stances on immigration and healthcare, tweeting: \u201cHow about taking care of American Citizens first!? That\u2019s the end of that race!\u201d The candidates broadly embraced an ambitious agenda, a sign of Democrats\u2019 leftward shift on social and economic issues and a trend Republicans hope to exploit by painting the party as socialist in the election race. \u201cIf we don\u2019t clearly define that we are not socialists, the Republicans are going to come at us every way they can and call us socialists,\u201d said former governor John Hickenlooper, who has been critical of Sanders\u2019 policies. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, and Biden, an avowed moderate, represent the two competing visions for the party and the country. Sanders had kicked off proceedings, launching into his classic stump speech, followed by Biden, who began with an attack on Trump. But it was California congressman Eric Swalwell who provided the first surprise of the night, repeatedly saying Biden needed to \u201cpass the torch\u201d to younger Democrats. Each Democrat was hoping for the kind of positive reception the New Jersey senator Cory Booker, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro received on Wednesday night, during the first of the two debates. As on Wednesday, the debate lineup reflected the diversity of a party increasingly led by women and people of color. There were three women \u2013 Harris, Gillibrand and author Marianne Williamson. And the openly-gay Buttigieg, as well as tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who is Asian American, and Harris, who is black and Asian American. For Americans who have not followed the 2020 election, which is still 15 months away, it was probably their first time seeing obscure candidates like Yang, and Williamson, a new-age guru and author, on TV. Yang spoke for just 2.4 minutes during the debate, the shortest time of any candidate, while Biden led at 11.5 minutes, and Harris spoke for 10.8 minutes. Biden is the best-known candidate and has consistently led national and state polls. But he has stumbled in recent weeks. Still, with support from black voters and an appeal to disaffected Democrats in the midwest, Biden believes he can rebuild the multiracial coalition that twice elected Barack Obama, under whom he served as vice-president. Sanders, by contrast, has called for a political revolution, championing progressive policies that would effectively remake the US economy. For all the attention on the field\u2019s heavyweights, the evening offered an opportunity for Harris to break out, and she did. During a particularly raucous exchange, as several candidates interrupted each other, Harris\u2019 voice rose about the din. \u201cHey, guys. America does not want a food fight,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThey want to hear how we\u2019re going to put food on their table.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
