On Sunday Catherine Spencer's side will face New Zealand, who have won the last two World Cups and looked formidable in defeating France 45-7 in their semi-final earlier in the evening. \"This has prepared us perfectly for the final against New Zealand,\" said Spencer. \"It would be great to beat them on home soil and I definitely believe we are good enough to do it. I really believe there is more to come from this unit.\" If the women are to go one better than England's men in 1991 and knock the Black Ferns off the top of the tree, they will have to subdue the extremely quick New Zealand backs but the hosts were impressive here in a fast, physical encounter. The only shadow over the evening was an injury to the left-wing Fiona Pocock who midway through the first half was prevented from scoring England's second try by a thumping tackle from her opposite number, Nicole Beck that sent the Richmond player hurtling into the advertising hoardings. Pocock left the field on a stretcher and her injured knee will make England's top try scorer in the tournament a doubt for Sunday. England's pack are the best in this tournament and they showed their strength early on with the Australian scrum forced into reverse gear and Spencer, the No8, crashed over for the first try. England dominated territory with some astute kicking from their fly-half Katy McLean and it was no surprise when they scored a second, the pack surging forward to give the full-back Danielle Waterman the chance to squeeze home in the corner. Twelve points up at the break, England continued to dominate territory but some handling errors and a raft of baffling substitutions, including that of the playmaker McLean, prevented them putting the game beyond the Australians' reach. England's cause was not helped when the Worcester flanker Heather Fisher was sent to the sin-bin 12 minutes from the end as her side continued to get on the wrong side of the New Zealand referee Nicky Inwood. Australian substitute Ruan Sims was also shown a yellow card for infringing at a ruck and Alice Richardson further punished her side with a penalty in front of the posts. England will be encouraged by their win over New Zealand when the sides met last year and in Maggie Alphonsi they have an outstanding flanker and Spencer said: \"We can improve collectively and individually and an England-New Zealand final is a really exciting prospect.\" England D Waterman (Worcester); C Barras (Saracens), E Scarratt (Lichfield), A Richardson (Richmond), F Pocock (Richmond); K McLean (Darlington), A Turner (Richmond); R Clark, A Garnett, R Crowley (Lichfield), T Taylor (Darlington), J McGilchrist (Wasps), H Fisher (Worcester), M Alphonsi (Saracens), C Spencer (Bristol, capt).
