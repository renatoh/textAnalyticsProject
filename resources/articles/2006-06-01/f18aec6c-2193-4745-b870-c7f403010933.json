Having shown themselves to be robust and useful in the first two group matches against Poland and Costa Rica they were flimsy and pliable against Germany. The World Cup hosts cruised to their third consecutive victory to win the group and now move to Munich on Saturday afternoon. Germany broke sweat, but that was the weather. Munich will not be as comfortable an occasion as this but Germany have such confidence and momentum that they will be relaxed about what lies next. When Lukas Podolski slid in to score their eighth goal of the tournament in the 57th minute he became the team's fourth different scorer. Only Paulo Wanchope has scored against them. Clean sheets and goals breed expectation. Miroslav Klose got another two to take his tally to four. In Britain the Werder Bremen player is regarded, to use a Sir Bobby Robson phrase, as \"top class but not top, top, top class\" but Klose may be causing a reappraisal with his form. On Monday he said that since he moved to Bremen he had improved as a player because of the club's feet-first style. Four years ago the forward impressed with his heading ability but none of his quartet of goals so far has been scored with his forehead. The opening game coincided with his 28th birthday and he looks like a man relishing his maturity. However, Klose's performance and that of each of his colleagues has to be seen in the context of Ecuador's fine impression of a team satisfied to have already finished second in the group. Their priority was clearly the avoidance of injuries and yellow cards and the conservation of energy. J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann was content afterwards -- he said Germany had \"World Cup fever\" -- but also realistic about the test faced yesterday. \"We know this is no comparison for what is in store for us,\" he said, \"but now the World Cup has really started.\" Unrecognisable from the team that beat Poland, Ecuador could at least claim yesterday that they were dangerous in the first minute of normal time and the second of injury-time. But in between they offered almost nothing as a forward presence. In that first minute the midfielder Luis Valencia danced his way around Philipp Lahm, whose defending may not be as good as his attacking. Valencia got to the byline and delivered a good cross which Jens Lehmann did well to intercept. It offered some promise. After that, though, Ecuador petered out. Instead of viewing that one move as an example of how Germany might be stretched, the South Americans sat back and waited for the hosts to bring the party to them. Which Germany did happily and quickly. \"They were stronger and faster than we were. That's why they dominated, not only on the scoreboard,\" Ecuador's coach Luis Su\u00e1rez said. \"In the past two matches we scored first. Today it was the other way round and it made life complicated. It affected the team mentally.\" After another rousing reception from increasingly believing fans, the Germans forced a fourth-minute corner which was not cleared efficiently. When the ball came back in Per Mertesacker swung a leg at it, Bastian Schweinsteiger recovered it before it bounced out and his dragback pass ran to Klose. Ecuador's Edwin Tenorio failed to get close enough to Klose and the volley flew into the bottom corner. It was the first goal that Ecuador had conceded in Germany but although the Germans took another 40 minutes to get a second, just before half-time, it was not because of a lack of opportunities. With Bernd Schneider prompting from the right of midfield, albeit given the time and space to do so, Klose was provided with chances in the 24th and 33rd minutes. Schneider, too, had a promising situation and Michael Ballack tried to score from 40 yards with Cristian Mora off his line. Ballack lasted the 90 minutes despite being on a yellow card and showed the odd glimpse of what he can do. It was not necessary for the captain to rampage but his chipped pass for Klose to round Mora to nab the second was a splash of Ballack creativity. With the contest over, the second half was played at jogging pace with the occasional sprint. One such brought Germany their third goal. A rare Ecuador probe was ended emphatically by the decisive challenge of Mertesacker and from him the ball was ferried swiftly to the lively Schweinsteiger edging over the halfway line. His pass found Schneider running down the right-hand side and the Bayer Leverkusen schemer sized up the situation instantly. Podolski was pelting through the middle to get beyond the backtracking Ecuador defence and Schneider supplied the perfect pass. Podolski met it on the run and steered it skilfully in by the far post."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
