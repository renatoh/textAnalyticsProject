For once, the bankers - some of them ex-bankers - passing hurriedly through the revolving glass doors looked like they believed him. Some even took his leaflet and stared at the prediction on the cover with terror. It was a good week for prophets of doom. Not so for bankers. David Z - he declined to give his last name - ignored the religious zealot as he pushed his way through the onlookers on 7th Avenue at 49th Street last Tuesday and stopped to preen himself mockingly before one of the many TV cameras eagerly seeking some hysterical former traders to film. But David was one of the lucky ones who had kept his job, at least for now, and was hopeful that another firm would step in and buy the division that housed his advisory unit. Given that he was not tearing his hair out or screaming his despair to the heavens, most of the media ignored him and looked for better quarry. Had they bothered to talk to him, they would have learnt that there was a growing chance that Barclays of the UK was going to buy much of Lehman's investment banking businesses and that the job losses in New York might be far fewer than the Cassandras expected. They would also have discovered how chaotic it was on Monday inside the Lehman HQ - a glass and steel monstrosity emblazoned with three-storey TV screens displaying 'Lehman' on a hypnotic fiery background. 'Seriously, on Monday morning it was like Bellevue in there,' David said, referring to the notorious New York psychiatric hospital. As workers arrived just hours after the news broke that the Fed would not lend the investment bank a hand but would allow it to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, traders were tearing down expensive artwork from the walls. Those with a more profit-focused outlook were selling on eBay whatever they could with the firm's logo on it. There were unverifiable reports of one trader urinating on his PC while screaming obscenities, but the employees I spoke to had only heard about it; no one had seen it happen. But, in a turn of events that could only happen in New York, open-top buses began pulling up outside Lehman depositing their payloads of snap-happy tourists on to the already busy pavement to take pictures of a big tower block. 'On your left,' the tour guide intoned through a crackly microphone, 'is the famous Lehman Brothers building', before going on to give an approximate history of the credit crunch. The tourists seemed to love it, in much the same way as peasants used to love a good hanging. But the Lehman collapse was just the first in an endless stream of historic events on Wall Street last week that have brought about the kind of fundamental changes in global finance that come along only once in a lifetime. Almost in lockstep with Lehman's collapse, Merrill Lynch declared an emergency merger with Bank of America. At a stroke, John Thain, the Merrill chief, had mapped out the future for the big beasts of Wall Street, and the once-revered Masters of the Universe who ran them. No more will investment banks be able to afford the existence they had carved out for themselves - an independent and charmed life financed by vast borrowing way beyond their means. Thain basically admitted that Merrill, pregnant with billions of dollars of sub-prime mortgage debt, had to rush to the altar for a shotgun wedding with Bank of America. Perhaps just as importantly, he was admitting that the days of the omnipotent and ego-driven Wall Street chief executive were over, too. Dick Fuld, the CEO of Lehman who allowed the bank to go down the tubes, was perhaps the ultimate example of such a titan. Merrill staff were harder to pin down than Lehman people. But my own financial adviser at the bank, who also declined to be named for fear of breaking company rules, said that the atmosphere was generally calm with everyone grateful the merger had been struck. Most were confident their jobs would be safe because they were the prized New York-based financial advisers that Bank of America in effect bought for $50bn. AIG workers were not so lucky, as the US government stepped in with an $85bn bridging loan in exchange for a 79.9 per cent stake in the insurer. The government is looking for buyers for much of the profitable side of the business to pay the loan back. 'People are happy that the government saved the company from collapsing, but very worried about which divisions will get sold and which might still close down to save money,' the Merrill financial adviser said. As the week wore on, almost every aspect of the Wall Street way of life was changing before our eyes. Share prices of the world's biggest banks were tumbling by 30 and 40 per cent a day, adding up to 50 and 60 per cent in the month alone. This not only exerts immense pressure on the banks themselves - and makes raising money to pay the bills next to impossible - but drains the personal wealth of tens of thousands of bankers down to almost worthless levels. The days of Bonfire of the Vanities-style cocaine binges or driving high-class escorts from the office to the yacht are over - if they ever existed. More prosaically, the huge houses in Westchester, ridiculously expensive rented summer homes in the Hamptons and private schools for the kids may also be at risk. A lot of bankers, traders and financiers are paid their big bonuses in special stock awards. Chief executives and their ilk receive almost all of their massive pay packets in the form of options and restricted stock of some sort. Many invested a great deal of their cash in more stock, so confident were they of making greater and greater returns. All that has come to a jolting halt. Look at Hank Greenberg, the former boss of AIG - indeed, the man who built the vast and complex financial services firm from a small insurance outfit. Analysts reckon he lost $3bn in the course of a couple of days last week. 'I've lost literally my entire net worth,' he said. 'I worked 40 years building the greatest insurance company in history, one everyone in the world envied.' He still has his own private jet though, so he must have something stashed away for a rainy day - about $28m by most accounts. As the share price slide continued, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the last two standalone investment banks, came under pressure to find a partner and join the new order. Goldman pooh-poohed talk of its demise but Morgan opened merger talks with US high-street bank Wachovia, while simultaneously going cap-in-hand to CIC, its Chinese silent partner, looking for cash. But last Thursday night, as regulators and politicians turned on short sellers of financial stocks, blaming them for the week's events, the Dow Jones Industrial Average suddenly leapt more than 400 points. Its biggest gain in six years was fuelled by rumours swirling through the market of yet more government intervention. And then came the biggest number of all, the true grand finale of the week. On Friday morning Hank Paulson called an emergency press conference to announce the biggest US government bailout in history. It will cost the American taxpayer hundreds of billions of dollars and see all the toxic sub-prime related mortgage debt in the US dumped on the government's shoulders. The taxpayer may be on the hook for as much as half a trillion dollars if this scheme goes ahead - but as Paulson himself warned, the cost will be much greater if we have to endure many more weeks like the past one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
