Rio police tweeted that, following a tip-off to a hotline, Denis Furtado, 45, had been arrested in the upmarket, beachside neighbourhood where he performed the buttock-enhancing treatment on bank manager Lilian Calixto, 46. She died in hospital in the early hours of Sunday morning. \u201cHe was arrested in a business centre in Barra de Tijuca,\u201d police tweeted, following up with a photo of Furtado and his mother, Maria F\u00e1tima Barros, in custody. Rio\u2019s O Globo news site reported that both Furtado and his mother had been arrested at a lawyer\u2019s office in a business centre. Furtado had become a celebrity in Brazil and revelled in his nickname in social media posts. He had more than 600,000 followers on his Instagram account and a further 44,000 on his Facebook page. He used both to publish \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d photos of his treatments. He had also posted about buttock-enhancing treatments using Poly (methyl methacrylate), or PMMA, a synthetic resin also known as acrylic glass filler. The Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society has issued warnings over its use. Preventive prison orders, akin to arrest warrants, had been issued for Furtado and his mother in connection with the murder of Calixto. While at large the pair had sought a judicial order so they could remain free while their case proceeded, but were turned down by a Rio court. A court statement said: \u201cThe doctor even broke the barrier of a parking lot in a shopping mall in Barra with a car on seeing a police vehicle and escaped with his mother.\u201d Furtado\u2019s girlfriend and receptionist, Renata Fernandes, has been detained in police custody. Police are also looking for a nursing technician. Furtado\u2019s mother was a doctor, but according to local media, her medical licence to practice in Rio had been suspended. Furtado was licensed to practice in Bras\u00edlia and the nearby state of Goi\u00e1s, where he also performed treatments, but not in Rio, according to the state\u2019s regional medical council. The Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society said he was not a trained plastic surgeon. Calixto was buried on Wednesday in Cuiab\u00e1. Relatives told local media she had told them that she was going to have a simple procedure without saying what it was and expected to be back that night. According to the G1 news site, a medical report by the Barra D\u2019Or private hospital showed she had arrived lucid, was showing signs of tachycardia, difficulties in breaching and was sweating. The hospital refused to comment. In a press conference on Wednesday in Bras\u00edlia, Furtado\u2019s lawyer Naiara Baldanza said her client was innocent and had not given himself up because he suffered from \u201cpanic syndrome\u201d. \u201cFor every truth there is a parallel truth,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cMany facts have surfaced and I am sure we will show the innocence of Dr Denis.\u201d In videos published on his Instagram account on Wednesday, Furtado said he was being treated unjustly. \u201cAs everyone knows, an accident happened,\u201d he said, adding a patient had left his consulting room after a treatment to her buttocks that he had performed many times. He then said he took Calixto to hospital where she had a heart attack."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
