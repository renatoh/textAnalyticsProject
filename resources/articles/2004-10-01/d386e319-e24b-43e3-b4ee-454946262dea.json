The league benefits from a waiver from Fifa that allows its member clubs to trade among themselves all year round. Fifa plans to withdraw that waiver from next season, a move that, Mawhinney said, \"seriously threatened\" the financial wellbeing of numerous clubs. Six weeks ago, however, the Premier League indicated that it could no longer support the League's position in its representations to Fifa, a decision that Mawhinney described as \"a great disappointment\". Speaking at the annual conference of Supporters' Direct, Mawhinney said: \"Football League clubs have always sold to survive, and if we lose this battle and clubs lose the dispensation to operate outside the window - and it will not be for a lack of trying - it will have serious consequences for our members.\" Mawhinney will travel to Brussels and Zurich to lobby European Union and Fifa officials in the coming weeks, with a final decision expected from Fifa in December. His comments reveal a significant tension between the two bodies that represent England's 92 professional clubs, a constituency whose views will be crucial to the forthcoming structural review of the Football Association. Mawhinney said the league would cooperate fully with the review, but declined to comment on what his organisation's recommendations would be. With limited income, often precarious finances and increasing supporter representation on club boards, the interests of many league clubs may not tally with those of the elite, and there must be some doubts about whether the professional game is capable of presenting a united front to the review. Mawhinney also announced that the \"fit and proper persons test\" to which club directors are subject was likely to be extended to include social as well as financial factors. A sub-committee is due to report back next week, but it is likely to recommend that anyone appearing on the Child Protection Register will be barred from being a club director. The league also hopes to announce a significant new sponsorship deal in the next fortnight. Charlton made a net profit of \u00a311.1m last year - due almost entirely to the sale of Scott Parker to Chelsea. The annual report for the 12-month period to June 20 2004 showed turnover increased to \u00a342.6m and the club made an operating profit of \u00a34.6m but a net loss of \u00a3500,000 was incurred before player transfers were taken into account. However, Parker's \u00a310m January move to Chelsea made the figures look much healthier as player sales for the year accounted for an income of almost \u00a311.7m. Charlton sacked their stadium announcer Brian Cole yesterday for taunting Crystal Palace before Wednesday's Carling Cup match at The Valley. Palace officials made a formal complaint to Charlton after Cole had directed inflammatory comments at Iain Dowie's men and the club may include the matter in their report to the Premier League. West Ham made a pre-tax profit of \u00a311.8m for the year ending May 31 2004, largely thanks to the \u00a324.8m they received from player sales. The club's bank loans have been reduced from \u00a344.1m to \u00a333m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
