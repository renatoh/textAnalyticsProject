Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said on Friday that the ban on religious services would \u201cprobably change before too long\u201d. He said the government had been \u201cvery good, they\u2019re listening very carefully\u201d, since faith leaders wrote to Boris Johnson this week challenging the ban. Welby told Good Morning Britain that churches were safe places in the Covid pandemic. \u201cPeople are well spread out, they\u2019re wearing masks, they\u2019re all registered. They\u2019re really sensible about it.\u201d Congregations needed communal worship to \u201cget the strength to serve and love their neighbours\u201d, he said. Faith leaders were not looking for a \u201cgreat big row\u201d with the government but had said that \u201cwe disagree with you about the need to close churches. This is one of the things that holds people together. It gives them a real sense of purpose and changes the world. So, I think that\u2019ll probably change before too long.\u201d On Thursday, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Catholic archbishop of Westminster, said he thought the policy on communal worship would change. The rule was \u201cnot supported by any scientific evidence and clearly shows a misunderstanding of the importance of religious faith\u201d, he told BBC Radio 4. \u201cI think it will be changed,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as possible, I hope to see places of worship opened again [for public worship].\u201d Under the lockdown regulations, places of worship may remain open for private prayer, support activities, such as food banks, and to stream services, but not for communal worship. The interfaith letter to Johnson was also signed by Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and Hindu leaders. Traditionally, Church of England parishes hold services on Remembrance Sunday, which falls this weekend, to commemorate British servicemen and women who died in the two world wars and other conflicts. Remembrance Sunday events held outdoors with social distancing in place will be permitted under the lockdown rules, but not church services. The government\u2019s guidelines note that Remembrance Sunday services are traditionally part of communal worship, but state: \u201cFrom 5 November, places of worship are not permitted to open for communal worship. Celebrants may, however, enter places of worship to broadcast services to their communities and will be able to incorporate Remembrance services as part of this when they do.\u201d The C of E will broadcast a special online service for the nation at 9am on Sunday, in which the Act of Remembrance will be read and the Last Post played, followed by a two-minute silence and the sounding of the reveille. Among those criticising the government\u2019s restrictions was the former Conservative defence secretary Michael Fallon, who told the Telegraph: \u201cIt seems ridiculous. We trusted veterans to put their lives on the line for the country, but we cannot trust them to stand 2 metres apart in church.\u201d Alan West, a former first sea lord, said: \u201cIt is not beyond the wit of man to have them allowed into a church. I think this ban is extraordinary. It should be overturned. If you look at the average size of a church, there must be a way of letting veterans in with social distancing. It seems very silly to have them standing outside in the freezing cold. This puts them more at risk. They will die of pneumonia rather than Covid-19, and that doesn\u2019t seem a very good way ahead at all.\u201d The former prime minister Theresa May told the Commons on Wednesday: \u201cIt [the church ban] has unintended consequences. The Covid-secure Remembrance service in Worcester cathedral is now going to be turned into a pre-recorded online service. Surely those men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom deserve better than this?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
