We simply don\u2019t think like others \u2013 enjoying ourselves on the mountain takes precedence over everything else. But that\u2019s not a bad thing \u2013 it\u2019s what makes each of us unique. You know you\u2019re a skier when \u2026 1 You have at least two snow forecast apps on your phone and you\u2019ve been checking the conditions in the resort you\u2019ve booked every day since September As your holiday draws near, you\u2019ll toggle between their slightly different predictions and believe the one that looks the best \u2013 you always like to look on the bright side, and predicting mountain weather is never an exact science is it? You\u2019ll probably also start checking the weather at your destination even though you\u2019re not due to arrive for several weeks. 2 While the rest of your friends are bemoaning the passing of summer, you\u2019re glad to see the back of it What\u2019s the point of weather without snow? You live for its squeaky crunch under your skis or board, the delicate pattern of an individual snowflake as it lands, intact, on your gloves, and the cosiness of hot chocolate by an open fire at the end of the day. Who would choose sunshine and beaches over all that? 3 Even though you normally struggle to get up for work, and look forward to nothing more than a weekend lie-in, you\u2019ll happily get up to catch the first lift every day in the mountains And while you loathe waiting for the train or bus at home, queuing for the lift is totally different because you know that the view at the top and that fantastic run down will both be well worth the wait. 4 You firmly believe in the adage that there is no such thing as bad weather, only the wrong clothes You didn\u2019t bring all those thermal layers and specialised goggles with you for nothing. Horizontal snow and howling winds don\u2019t faze you at all \u2013 you\u2019re only taking your skis off if they close the lifts. Even then you might stay outside for a bit of husky sledding or snow-shoeing \u2013 or if it\u2019s really too cold, the spa looks pretty inviting. 5 But equally, you\u2019re never happier than on those days in the mountains when the sky is blue and the snow is fresh If you were honest, you\u2019d put those times up there with the births of your children and your wedding day, but obviously you\u2019re not allowed to tell anyone that. 6 You don\u2019t feel that you\u2019ve had a proper holiday unless you\u2019ve eaten some kind of hot cheese every day In fact a daily cheese fondue, raclette, or pizza is almost obligatory, isn\u2019t it? And while the beer should always be cold, as far as you\u2019re concerned the red wine, in the form of vin chaud or gl\u00fchwein, should always be hot, spiced and sugared. 7 You know the day isn\u2019t over just because the sun\u2019s gone down While the slopes are, of course, the main event, you\u2019re not going to be sitting around twiddling your thumbs come sunset. Maybe you\u2019ll do a spot of night skiing on a floodlit slope, unwind in a hot tub or sauna, or enjoy a leisurely dinner in a cosy restaurant. It doesn\u2019t really matter exactly what you do \u2013 every evening is special simply for being in the mountains. 8 Ski stories are the best stories Instead of your typical evening conversations back home, about whose turn it is to cook dinner and whether anyone has fed the cat, you\u2019re more likely to find yourself enthusing about that brilliant red run that always seems to have the best snow at any time of day, or perhaps that amazing trail you tried with a guide yesterday. And if you\u2019re staying in a hotel, you won\u2019t even have to discuss who\u2019s taking the bins out. 9 Your ski jacket means more to you than the rest of your wardrobe You wouldn\u2019t say you were particularly into clothes and certainly not bothered about designer labels, but skiwear is different! Your ski jacket is your most prized possession. You did a lot of research before you bought this one and you love everything about it \u2013 not least all those pockets. Even so, you already know you might get a new one next year. The technology updates all the time and in the mountains it\u2019s important to be super comfortable, isn\u2019t it? 10 No meal in a restaurant feels complete until you\u2019ve been given a strangely-coloured liqueur It could be g\u00e9n\u00e9pi, schnapps, limoncello or grappa, depending on where you are. That\u2019s just the way they do things in the mountains \u2013 they\u2019re hospitable like that. You\u2019re really full and you wouldn\u2019t normally drink any more but it would clearly be rude to refuse. Anyway, a tot wonderfully warming in this kind of weather.
