In previous years many, though not all, of Gaza\u2019s 1,100-strong Christian minority have been granted exit permits to Jerusalem and the West Bank for worship and to visit relatives at Easter and Christmas. But last week the Israeli military announced that only 200 Christians over the age of 55 would be allowed to travel to Jordan \u2013 without stopping in Jerusalem. The unprecedented decision sparked protests, including by the Israeli human rights agency Gisha, which called it \u201ca further violation of Palestinians\u2019 fundamental rights to freedom of movement, religious freedom and family life\u201d. The agency added that it was part of a policy to \u201cdeepen the separation\u201d between Gaza and the West Bank and \u201cadvance and legitimise \u2026 annexation of the West Bank\u201d. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, suggested this month he is contemplating such unilateral annexation of at least parts of the West Bank. Then, in an apparent shift, Israeli government officials said on Friday: \u201cFollowing the recommendations of the security establishment, during this coming Easter hundreds of Christians from the Gaza Strip will be allowed to visit Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] and East Jerusalem and to go abroad.\u201d However, on Saturday leading Christians in Gaza said no permits had so far been issued. For Gaza\u2019s small Catholic community, the main pontifical mass is held at Jerusalem\u2019s Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Most Christian Gazans are Greek Orthodox and observe Easter next weekend. George Anton, a prominent Catholic Gaza activist, expressed scepticism that permits would be issued in time despite \u201crumours\u201d to the contrary, especially because of extra restrictions during this week\u2019s Jewish Passover holiday. He said Catholics in Gaza were \u201cupset\u201d and \u201cdisappointed\u201d at not having already received permits. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any reason to refuse our permits,\u201d Anton added. \u201cWe understand that there is a siege of Gaza and procedures against its citizens. But Christians from Gaza are no threat to Israeli security. And it is our right to celebrate our religious holidays in international law, as it is for all Christians, Jews and Muslims. The churches should be putting this issue in the political arena.\u201d Hani Farah, secretary general of Gaza\u2019s YMCA, said that while he was encouraged by indications that Israel might be relenting, even in the past many applicants had been refused. \u201cSometimes the parents get permits and the children don\u2019t, and sometimes the children get them and the parents don\u2019t.\u201d Like hundreds of other Christian Gazans who had applied for permits as long ago as last month, Farah \u2013 who is a lay member of the Greek Orthodox community \u2013 had not so far received one for himself, his wife or their four children. Miriam Marmur, Gisha\u2019s international spokesperson, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that Israeli authorities will have time to process individual permit applications while understaffed during Passover. And even if permits \u2026 are suddenly announced, people won\u2019t have time to prepare for travel or appeal the decision if they have been denied a permit.\u201d Ms Marmur said that the conduct of the issue \u201creflects the disturbingly little concern that Israeli authorities have towards the actual needs of Gaza residents, let alone their fundamental rights\u201d. There was no immediate response from the Israeli military\u2019s civil affairs division, Cogat (Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories), when asked on Saturday how many permits for Jerusalem and the West Bank would be issued, and when."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
