It was the first since the torso of the still unidentified African boy, wearing a pair of orange shorts, was found near Tower Bridge on September 21 last year. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: \"The arrested woman lives in Glasgow and she is of West African origin. She is married but living alone at present.\" The married mother, who is in her 30s, lived in south side of Glasgow but had connections with London, police said. Officers are believed to have found something significant at her home when they went to see her early this morning. She was flown to London from Glasgow by police after her arrest today, where she was being questioned at a police station in south London. Detectives described the arrest as \"significant\". The dead boy was thought to have been five or six years' old when he died after his throat was cut and his head and limbs cut off in what is believed to have been a ritual sacrifice. Police efforts to identify the boy, whom they call Adam, have failed, although a reward of \u00a350,000 has been offered for information leading to the conviction of his killer. Detectives initially pursued the theory that Adam could have been the victim of a black magic killing of the kind practised in South Africa. Police there have estimated that hundreds of children may have been killed by witchdoctors practising a perversion of traditional \"muti\" medicine, using body parts to make life enhancing ointments and potions. British officers leading the hunt for Adam's killer travelled to South Africa where Nelson Mandela made a public appeal for information. But an expert on African ritual practices, who has been advising the Metropolitan police on the case, has said it might also be linked to West African voodoo. One theory is that he was bought as a slave in sub-Saharan Africa and brought to Britain to be sacrificed. Detectives across Europe believe ritualistic killings have spread from Africa in recent years. They are already investigating a string of cases in France, Greece, Italy and the US. Following the discovery of Adam, British detectives are already re-examining a 33-year-old murder case in which the headless torso of a baby girl was found hidden in bushes in Epping Forest, Essex."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
