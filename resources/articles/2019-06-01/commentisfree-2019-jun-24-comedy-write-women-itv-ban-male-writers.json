Of course not \u2013 but do more to give women a chance", "bodyText": "Last Monday, I spoke for five minutes on a panel in Bradford, alongside the head of ITV comedy, about diversity in television. As a working comedy writer, I was well positioned to make the point that comedy is better when it\u2019s written by a wide range of voices \u2013 people of different genders, races, sexualities, everything. Mad controversial, right? Burn the witch! I assumed my comments would, like most comments ever made on panel discussions, be lost in the annals of time. Even if I wasn\u2019t, like most people on panels, speaking out of my annals. Quite the shock, then, when I woke up the next morning to find that my name, photo, quotes and tweets had been used \u2013 without my knowledge \u2013 on multiple news platforms. Most under versions of the inaccurate headline \u201cITV bans all-male comedy teams\u201d. I opened story after story to see an (old) photo of myself, looking like a demented elf who just tried ketamine for the first time, staring up at the world as the new poster child for \u201ckeeping men out of comedy\u201d \u2026 GO AWAY MEN! TAKE YOUR PENISES, TUCK THEM BETWEEN YOUR LEGS AND NEVER BE FUNNY AGAIN! The stories mentioned I had recently been hired to write on ITV\u2019s CelebAbility, a show that had no female writers on its previous two series. The headlines might as well have read: \u201cAll men are BANNED from comedy for ever, and will be replaced with inferior women who wouldn\u2019t know a joke if it hit them in the tits. [Giggles. Tits \u2026]\u201d Predictably, men were outraged and, with an easily searchable surname like Titley [Giggles. \u201cTitley\u201d], I was a target. My fault, really. I had committed the trifecta of crimes: being a woman, a woman on the internet, and a woman on the internet with a job. So the trolls mobilised: did I know I was ruining comedy? That I was only hired to tick a box? That because of me, Only Fools and Horses never got written in the past? That I was part of #GalQaeda? To be fair, GalQaeda is a hilarious hashtag. Maybe we should let men do comedy. I can\u2019t speak for ITV but as far as I understand it, nothing has been \u201cbanned\u201d. ITV\u2019s comedy commissioner, the excellent Saskia Schuster, has launched an initiative, Comedy 50:50, to move away from all-male writers\u2019 rooms \u2013 and has changed ITV contracts so shows must aim towards equal gender representation. If you don\u2019t know what a writers\u2019 room is, (congratulations, you\u2019ve made better life choices than me), it\u2019s a group of writers, usually put together by producers in order to write jokes for a sketch or entertainment show or create stories for a sitcom. Historically they have been male-dominated, and I admire Saskia\u2019s attempts to draw in more much-needed female voices. (And I\u2019m not just saying that so she\u2019ll commission the sitcom I pitch her next month \u2013 working title: GalQaeda.) The reaction online revealed an uncomfortable truth: some people are terrified of inclusion. On the one hand, I get it. If TV comedy was an antelope you were eating and some female writers came along and started eating the antelope too \u2026 there\u2019d be less antelope for you. I\u2019d understand that you might be chagrined. But \u2013 and I know this sounds crazy \u2013 TV writing is NOT an antelope. More varied voices create better comedy. And better comedy creates an appetite for MORE comedy. It serves everyone in television when shows go well. Great shows beget great shows, we\u2019ve all seen it happen. After you loved Fleabag, didn\u2019t you crave more shows like it? Success feeds the industry. Even if Fleabag\u2019s sexy priest left us all on our knees, horny and confused. When certain people hear that there\u2019s to be an end of \u201call-male writers\u2019 rooms\u201d, they don\u2019t hear \u201cthis will be better for everyone\u201d. They hear \u201csomething is being taken away from you\u201d. As the saying goes: when you\u2019re accustomed to privilege, sometimes equality feels like oppression. The big (misguided) belief is that the men already in the writers\u2019 room \u201cdeserve to be there\u201d and the new women don\u2019t. That\u2019s a myth. Everyone who has ever worked in TV got there because someone opened a door for them. If they can\u2019t do the job they won\u2019t last long. This is just about giving more people a chance in a system that has not, until now, been designed to do so. Is that really such a big ask? (Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll still get paid less.) I understand that headlines are designed to grab our attention and make us click, but it\u2019s annoying when a good news story is framed as a bad one. If I, a lowly comedy writer, could make a gentle suggestion: not everything has to be a culture war. Not every conversation has to have two polar views with no room for nuance. Life is nuance. (OK, that \u201clife is nuance\u201d sentence is a bit on the nose, but don\u2019t worry: I\u2019ll get a room of men to rewrite it later). For the sake of the future of comedy, hire more varied writers. And I don\u2019t just mean female writers: hire more writers of colour, more queer, disabled, trans, working-class writers, maybe even some vegan writers \u2026 And look, I can only take on the world one article at a time, but how about we open this attitude of inclusion to all industries? To all people? Remember, if they\u2019re not good enough, they\u2019ll quickly fall away. But if they are good enough, it will make the work better and stronger. For all of us. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to get back to writing my GalQaeda pitch \u2013 which Andrew Lloyd Webber has already agreed to score. \u2022 Brona C Titley is a TV comedy writer and actor"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
