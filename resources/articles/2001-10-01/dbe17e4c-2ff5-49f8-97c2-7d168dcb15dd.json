The company had already warned investors in August to expect a first quarter loss, but the results are even worse than expected, and part of Sun's answer is a 9% cut in its workforce. The company saw its share price fall by 4% this morning in early trading on Nasdaq. Sun has so far avoided the mass redundancies that other major high tech firms have imposed, but the company's chief executive, Scott McNealy, said a weakening global economy and the terrorist attacks of September 11 made cuts in the approximately 43,000-strong workforce necessary. He said: \"Things were tough with the economy before, but now we are facing increasing uncertainties both in the US and globally. To ensure the long term health of the business, we are making structural changes to the capacity of our company.\" He added: \"Over the past several months, we've been aggressively managing costs in all areas. Our employees came through in force and without that, we would clearly be talking about reducing capacity to an even greater extent. We intend to get the business profitable again as soon as possible.\" Sun said it expected revenues in the first quarter of between $2.7bn and $2.9bn, lower than the $3.3bn Wall Street had expected.
