There isn't a student in the country who wouldn't think twice before demanding the dealer sort it out - so why have postgrads been so reluctant to complain when their courses fail to live up to promises made in the prospectus? In many ways 'buying' a postgraduate course should be viewed in exactly the same way as buying a car - after all, the costs involved are pretty comparable. Two weeks ago a class of students made legal history by winning a lawsuit against their college for poor teaching. In this landmark case the group had all passed their higher national diploma course in historic vehicle restoration, but sued the college they had attended in Oxfordshire claiming that their qualifications were worthless, as none had gained jobs in the field. The fact that the course was substantially different from that promised meant they won their case. But what are your options if the postgrad course you're following is generally OK, but has more than a few shortcomings? According to James Groves, the general secretary of the National Postgraduate Committee, the body which represents postgrads' interests, students are getting better at complaining. \"They are starting to see themselves more as a consumer of a product than simply a student, and are reacting accordingly when things don't go right. Postgrads have always been more likely to complain than undergraduates simply because they already have an experience of college against which to judge their new course. However, and most importantly, they are usually paying their own fees and have a greater expectation of getting exactly what they have paid for.\" He says the majority of complaints that his organisation receives are to do with facilities and the quality of supervision. \"Courses are sometimes sold by colleges - particularly to international students - on the basis that they will have access to fantastic library or IT facilities that then fail to materialise. A more likely complaint occurs when the relationships between student and supervisor breaks down and the quality of teaching suffers. \"You have to try and work out whether the problems you have are simply teething troubles, or whether there is something fundamentally wrong. Most of the former can usually be sorted out amicably - the latter can be more difficult.\" James reports that anecdotal evidence suggesting that more students are making complaints might be due simply to the fact that universities are getting much better at dealing with them. \"In the past there was a tendency for colleges to brush these things under the carpet and hope the student would just give up and go away. Today, most universities abide by a code of practice and complaints procedures are less opaque - and are taken more seriously as a result.\" He says students with a complaint should first try to resolve it informally by talking it through with the person concerned, taking a \"friendly but firm attitude\". He says it is a good idea to bring in the student union's dedicated complaints person early on, as they can often mediate. \"If that doesn't work and things are getting serious it is worth keeping a hard copy of all correspondence, including emails. Ultimately if you fail to get a satisfactory response and you feel you have a genuine grievance, you should consult a solicitor.\" If things do get that bad, there is one man you probably want to call. Jaswinder Gill represented the students in the Oxfordshire case, and is the co-author of a recently published book entitled Universities and Students . In it he clarifies the legal relationship between institutions and their students, focuses on the key issues that can give rise to disagreement, and examines how they can be sorted out. \"Although every case I see is different and it can be difficult to generalise, it all comes down to breach of contract. If you do a masters in history and you were promised teaching on the nineteenth century, but you are only offered twentieth century then that patently is a breach of promise. I acted for one student who started a course combining Spanish and computing but when the student arrived the Spanish element simply didn't exiss.\" He says the recent case is interesting because the majority of students stuck out the course and were awarded qualifications. \"This is wholly different from previous cases. Previously, students have sued when they have not been given a service and have failed to gain qualifications. But it is not now good enough for universities and colleges to turn around and say to aggrieved students: 'You've got your qualification, so what's the problem?' It's not about gaining the qualification; it's about the quality of that qualification.\" In that case the students argued that promises made in the college prospectus, in course material and by course representatives during interviews were not met. Promised placements in industry failed to materialise, as did the promised 50% of practical and vocational work, and basic tools had not been available. He suggests in these cases it is relatively easy to prove the college was at fault - in others in can be more difficult. \"You might have been promised access to a computer terminal but find you are having to wait several hours to get it. The fact that you can access it - albeit following a long wait - means the college has technically done what it said it would even though the arrangement is unacceptable.\" Although the damages are yet to be set in the recent case, Jaswinder says students who are successful in the courts can win serious money. \"If you gave up a good job to do the course, damages will not only cover the money you spent on fees, accommodation etc but they will reflect the time you lost and the potential harm to your career - in some cases it can add up to quite a sizeable amount,\" he says. milesbrignall@blueyonder.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
