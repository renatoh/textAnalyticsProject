The website, titled Transport for London Bailout Facts, describes itself as \u201ceverything you need to know about TfL\u2019s second bailout\u201d. It attacks the mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s oversight of the authority at a time when it has needed a \u00a31.8bn government bailout after revenues fell during the pandemic. Only at the very bottom of the page does the site state that it is \u201cpublished by Kerry Halfpenny on behalf of Shaun Bailey\u201d, before listing the address of the Conservative campaign headquarters in London. The website makes no explicit reference to the Conservative party or to Bailey\u2019s hopes to challenge Khan for the mayoralty, meaning the website\u2019s source may not be obvious to some readers. The \u201cfacts\u201d claims have also been made in a leaflet campaign. The Conservatives have previously faced criticism for masquerading as a factchecking service during the 2019 general election. During the leaders\u2019 debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, the party\u2019s press account changed its name and branding to \u201cfactcheckUK\u201d. Will Moy, the chief executive of Full Fact, an independent factchecking website, said the practice should be stopped, highlighting several instances of political parties and campaigners in the EU referendum creating similarly misleading materials. \u201cIt is inappropriate and misleading for a candidate for political office to brand campaign material as an independent resource,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a democracy, voters need meaningful transparency to make informed decisions. Self-respecting politicians should make their own arguments in their own names.\u201d The site first appeared on the Internet Archive, an automated web archive, on Sunday. Bailey does not appear to have shared the website on his Twitter account since then, but his profile contained a picture of the web address on a campaign vehicle and pictures of volunteers holding leaflets with similar designs. Bailey had been due to go up against Khan in mayoral elections in May this year but the vote was postponed to May 2021 owing to the coronavirus lockdown. The decline in travel since the start of the pandemic has pushed TfL\u2019s finances to the brink, and the government stepped in to bail it out at the weekend. A spokesman for Bailey\u2019s campaign said Khan was \u201ctrying to avoid responsibility\u201d for \u00a39.6bn in money wasted by TfL. \u201cLondoners have a right to know the truth,\u201d he said. A spokeswoman for Khan said Bailey\u2019s campaign was \u201cdeliberately lying\u201d and described the website as \u201cfake news masquerading as \u2018facts\u2019\u201d. She said: \u201cThe Tories must stop trying to take Londoners for fools.\u201d The government will step in with \u00a31.8bn to keep TfL running for the next six months, after a heated political battle between Khan and Boris Johnson, his predecessor as mayor. In return, TfL has agreed to shelve plans to build a second Crossrail link and to investigate a possible rollout of driverless trains. Johnson and Bailey have argued that Khan was responsible for \u201cbankrupting\u201d TfL. Khan has described this as a \u201cblatant lie\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
