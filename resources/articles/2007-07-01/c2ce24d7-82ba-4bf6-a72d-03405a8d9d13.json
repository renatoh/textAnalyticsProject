Yesterday as interest rates were jacked up for the fifth time in less than a year the message came loud and clear: the Bank of England wants the economy to slow down. The risks of going too fast are evident, and remembered by most veterans of previous credit carnages. Yet there are dangers in leaning too heavily on the lever of interest rates. Consumers have taken on record levels of debt and will have to pay more for it. The Bank of England had some good reasons for yesterday's quarter-point rise. The British economy, just like the rest of the world's, is still strong while the era of ever-falling goods prices looks to be over. Indeed, the revival of that old double act, Growth and its unloved partner Inflation, caused a turbulent readjustment on world markets a few weeks ago. Chinese manufacturers and Indian back-office workers are charging more; prices for commodities from oil to food remain high; while British service firms and even long-suffering manufacturers are ready to raise prices. Inflation may no longer be over the 3% ceiling set by the chancellor, but surveys show that the public thinks it will remain high at 2.7% - and you don't need a degree in econometric modelling to see the link between expectations and higher prices. Oh, and the headache of soaraway house prices has yet to go away: they are still rising at over 10% a year. So far, so familiar. The Bank's litany of worries was little changed this time from its four other rate increases since last August. What is different is the mounting evidence that monetary tightening is having an effect. Some of the biggest names in cheap-thrills Britain, that land of consumer opportunity which has emerged over the past decade, are already feeling the pain. There have been profits warnings from Ryanair and the UK's biggest car dealer, Pendragon, while Tesco has also noted a sharp slowdown in trade. These and other straws in the wind would have justified the Bank in leaving rates alone this week. But rate-setters have put themselves in a position where choosing not to increase them would have given an unpleasant jolt to markets. The monetary policy committee has been applauded for not surprising investors, but that does not mean it should never do so. After all, its constituency stretches rather further than the City. An increase in rates is obviously good news for savers, and those who have sat out the Great British Debt Party. Yet the credit splurge is now into record territory, with economists at PWC calculating that 19% of our disposable income goes towards paying off debts. That is above the level it reached in 1990, and leaves rate-setters with the problem that if they go along with calls to push rates to 6% or above, more than a few borrowers will struggle to keep pace with the loan-repayment treadmill. There are also specific areas of acute stress. Some people may have gone deep into debt to get a foot on the housing ladder, and the Woolwich this week reported that first-time buyers in parts of London are paying half their salaries in mortgage charges. There are also over 2m homeowners on fixed-rate loans which expire over the next 18 months; a lot of these will be downing all five rate hikes in one big gulp. A big feature of this boom has been the democratisation of debt, with those less well-off able to borrow more easily than ever before. Experian, consultants to many credit-card firms, forecasts that some of the poorest social groups will be hardest hit by these rises. These are reasons for the Bank to exercise caution before hiking again. It should be as ready to loosen policy as to tighten it. The credit boom has encouraged many to go further into debt than ever before. The result is a consumer economy entering uncharted territory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
