Ramirez, 39, who won World Series titles with the Red Sox in 2004 and 2007, was arrested on Monday after his wife, Juliana, accused him of hitting her face with an open hand during an argument at their home in Weston, Florida. The former slugger, originally from the Dominican Republic, was charged with battery and ordered to put up $2,500 (\u00a31,580) bail before he was released from a South Florida jail on Tuesday. According to the police report, Ramirez acknowledged the couple had an argument while in bed. He told officers he had grabbed his wife by the shoulders and shaken her, causing her to hit her head against the bed's headboard. Juliana Ramirez told the operator of an emergency helpline, when she called on Monday, \"My husband just hit me ... in my face, in my head on the bed ... He's not doing anything anymore 'cause he knows I'm calling the police\". The police report noted a red swelling on the side of Juliana Ramirez's face. Ramirez retired from baseball in the spring of this year, shortly after he tested positive for a banned substance for the second time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
