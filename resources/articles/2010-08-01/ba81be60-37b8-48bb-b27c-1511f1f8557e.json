Listened to 50 years on, the Russell-Gaitskell debate has two particularly striking aspects. The first is the courteous clarity of the well-matched argument between the political intellectual Russell and the intellectual politician Gaitskell. The second is the enduring topicality of the subject matter, not just whether Britain should have its own nuclear weapons programme but also whether, even in 1960, we could any longer afford one. An adverse comparison between the high-quality political debate of the past and the less elevated debate of the present carries the risk that it is made through rose-tinted spectacles. Nevertheless, it is not hard to feel that something has been lost in the diminished role played by public intellectuals in modern politics and in the parallel decline of the intellectual politician. There are exceptions, of course. At his best, Gordon Brown might have gone head to head with Milton Friedman, while David Willetts might have produced a fascinating debate with the late Tony Judt. But, as Tony Benn observed in the programme, all generations have a responsibility to think out alternative courses on major questions publicly and clearly. That is not happening today, either on nuclear disarmament or the economy. And we are the poorer for it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
