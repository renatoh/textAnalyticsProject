Hodgson\u2019s side will complete preparations for the tournament with Thursday\u2019s friendly against Portugal at Wembley with the intention to select a strong side that is likely to provide the basis of the team to start the opening Group B game against Russia. The manager will travel with the youngest 23-man squad of any of the 24 nations involved in France, maintaining the side\u2019s evolution over his four-year spell in charge, and determined England will make amends for their dismal results at the World Cup in Brazil. \u201cWe owe those fans something,\u201d said Neville. \u201cThe way in which they treated us at the end of that game against Costa Rica [in Brazil], when we walked over to them \u2026 I\u2019ve never seen that before. I hope people recognise there was an 18-year-old on the pitch against Costa Rica in Luke Shaw, there was Ross Barkley [who was 20], Phil Jones [22], all youngish lads apart from Frank [Lampard, at 36]. Jack Wilshere was 22, and the 19-year-old Raheem Sterling came on. \u201cYes, people would argue that the 2014 tournament was a major disappointment. I\u2019d agree with that, but this summer is a big moment in terms of how the four years will be viewed, in terms of the four-year contract we were all given. People will judge it based upon tournaments. \u201cI think Roy can be proud of an excellent piece of work. It needs a good finish in the summer. My view would be that he would go on beyond the summer because at this moment in time he\u2019s doing the right things and making the right decisions, not just for himself, but for the team long term.\u201d Hodgson, who will be without the injured Ryan Bertrand against the Portuguese, is expected to employ a diamond formation, with doubts persisting over a 4-3-3 in the absence of the injured Danny Welbeck. The lineup on Thursdaywill incorporate the captain, Wayne Rooney, and Harry Kane up front in the team\u2019s Wembley sendoff. England had hoped to confront Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of their preparations aimed at nullifying Gareth Bale when they play Wales in Lens in their second fixture in France, though those aspirations have been dashed with the Real Madrid forward having been granted time off before the finals. Regardless, England\u2019s youthful selection \u2013 there are only four players over 30 in the squad \u2013 will seek to demonstrate they should feature against Russia in Marseille with the emphasis placed on bringing through young talent indicative of Hodgson\u2019s philosophy as manager. \u201cI think of 2010 in South Africa and old players called back out of retirement and panic calls on the last day to players to come and play,\u201d said Neville, interviewed in Henry Winter\u2019s book Fifty Years of Hurt, which is released on Thursday. \u201cRoy went the other way. He went with Barkley, Sterling, Welbeck, Jones and Smalling. Flanagan and Stones were brought in pre-tournament. In Roy\u2019s biggest game, Montenegro, he gave Andros Townsend his debut, and then [his second cap] against Poland [to seal qualification for the 2014 World Cup]. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the World Cup first game against Italy with Daniel Sturridge, Sterling, Rooney and Welbeck in the same team. I\u2019ve seen Alli, Dier and other young players playing against France [in November last year]. \u201cI\u2019ve seen young players continually promoted over a three-year period. I\u2019ve seen Luke Shaw taken to a World Cup over Ashley Cole. I\u2019ve seen Ross Barkley taken to a World Cup over Michael Carrick. What Roy\u2019s been over the last four years is bold. He\u2019s taken the average age down from 28/29 to 23/24 from Euro 2012 to Euro 2016. He\u2019s made a series of really good decisions for the English team but also for future tournaments, for the next two to four years, and hopefully he, we, can see that through.\u201d England (4-1-2-1-2; probable): Hart; Clyne, Smalling, Cahill, Rose; Dier; Henderson, Lallana; Alli; Rooney, Kane."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
