In the classical section, where phalanxes of CDs once marched as far as the eye could see, now are swathes of empty space. There used to be 10 shelves for contemporary music; now there are just two. The lower ground floor - former home of classic vinyl, easy listening and Elvis - has been concealed by a shabby curtain. Move it aside and you see a mass graveyard for skeletal, empty CD racks. Tower is staggering towards an untimely demise. The American company is closing its UK operation; customers are being handed leaflets blaming rent hikes and competition from supermarkets. Insiders also point to Tower's heavy borrowing in the US and an old-fashioned approach to the business - half a dozen years ago its stocktaking still wasn't computerised. Tower, at its peak, was a chain store with the sensibility of an independent. Its buyers stocked music that they found interesting, and there was nowhere like it if you wanted anything esoteric. The leases of the London stores are being assigned to the Virgin Retail Group. It will not be the same. Tower is not the only free spirit to have left us. Ted Perry, who founded Hyperion Records in 1980, died last week. Both Tower and Perry stood for individuality, an unwillingness to toe the line. Perry proved that someone with a good ear and a taste for hard graft could make a success of an independent label. In the early days, he drove a minicab to pay the bills; it was on a nocturnal shift that he heard Gothic Voices singing music by Hildegard of Bingen on Radio 3. He recorded them in 1982 - and had a hit. Later bold choices included a complete Liszt edition: 95 CDs and counting. Today the Hyperion brand is strong, but would Perry make a success of it if he were starting out now? These are tough times in CD retail. Classical CDs account for only about 6% of the total market; and in 2001, 14% of those sold featured Russell Watson, according to the British Phonographic Industry. You can see why retailers don't want Luigi Nono CDs cluttering up the shop floor - particularly the supermarkets, a sector that is gradually increasing its share of the classical market: from 9% in the first half of 2001 to 11.3% in the first half of last year. Is there any hope, then, for the consumer who wants something more than the Lord of the Rings soundtrack? Well, there is the internet - one place where shelf space does not matter. And there is one unexpectedly encouraging statistic. Independent classical labels such as Chandos and Harmonia Mundi are reporting huge increases in sales - in excess of 20% from 2001 to 2002 - to independents. Can it be true? Small record shops, run by real people, actually wanting to stock interesting music, and even selling it? It must be a myth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
