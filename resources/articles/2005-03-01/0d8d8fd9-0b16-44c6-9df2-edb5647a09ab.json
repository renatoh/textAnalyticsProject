Ask a farmer about the weather, the harvest or the price of fat lambs and you will be buried under an avalanche of information. Enquire how many acres he farms and you will be told to the nearest decimal point - with maybe a tiny exaggeration to show how successful he is. But if you ever question him about the size of his subsidy cheque from Brussels, you will find that he changes the subject instantly. Were you to persist, and to point out with infinite politeness that, as a taxpayer, you had personally contributed to this cheque, he would become either flustered or irritated or both. Eventually he would announce that this was a confidential matter and one that he did not wish to discuss. All of which explains why Oxfam was totally justified in pressing the government to reveal the amounts paid to individual farmers as their share of the common agricultural policy. It is unjust, unreasonable and above all unintelligent for British farmers to insist that the subsidy cheque they receive each year is a private matter between themselves and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. If your grandmother were this coy about her old age pension, she would be an object of ridicule - since the exact size of the pension is public knowledge. So also, paradoxically, was the amount per acre that arable farmers received for growing cereals and other crops. To calculate the size of a farmer's cheque all you needed to do was to ask how many acres of each crop he grew. No farmer I have ever met would refuse to give you this information. So why are farmers so paranoid about their subsidy? And why was it necessary for Oxfam to invoke the Freedom of Information Act to obtain this information? There are two reasons. The first is that inside every farmer, from the Lincolnshire arable tycoon to the Lancashire hill farmer, is a peasant trying to stay in. Peasants have many admirable characteristics, but one of their less attractive traits is a profound distrust of the outside world. Hence this obsession with secrecy when it comes to matters financial. The second reason is perhaps even more profound. Farmers have long considered themselves to be a race apart, a chosen people. They are - or like to think of themselves as - sturdy independent yeomen battling the elements in their lonely profession as they feed an ungrateful public. Imagine, therefore, how humiliating it is for them to admit that without their annual subsidy cheque they would all go bankrupt. The best way to cope with this dreadful realisation is to pretend that the subsidy doesn't exist. By living in this make-believe land farmers have at least managed to keep their pride intact. Until Oxfam came along and ruined it. But Oxfam is far from blameless in this matter. It is outraged that 80% of the subsidy goes to 20% of the farmers. Pause while hands are wrung. Yet it knows perfectly well that 80% of the land is owned by 20% of the farmers and the subsidy is paid on a per acre basis. It now appears that Oxfam feels that these small farmers should rightfully receive a far bigger slice of the cake because there is something inherently noble and good about being a small farmer. In the mind of Oxfam, small appears to be both beautiful and deserving. But where does this leave the small hairdresser, the small garage and the small butcher's shop? Should they too receive preferential treatment from Brussels? And, come to think of it, does the same apply to charities themselves? Oxfam, with its annual income of millions, is a giant by any standards. So if we followed Oxfam's logic we should all stop contributing to their appeals and instead send our cheques to a small charity like War On Want. Oxfam is correct to point out the idiocy of the common agricultural policy. But it ignores the crucial fact that the entire subsidy system was changed radically at the beginning of the year. Henceforth, the money will be paid not as an incentive to produce grain mountains and milk lakes but simply as a reward for looking after the landscape and the environment. I am unaware of any evidence that suggests that a small farmer looks after the countryside better than a large one. Indeed, since this is an expensive (and financially unrewarding) activity, it could be argued that the richer the farmer, the more able he is to act as a park-keeper. It may pain the north Oxford politburo to realise that British agriculture has moved with the times. It should look back at the rural economy in the first half of the 20th century when the farms in this country were precisely what Oxfam wishes they were today - small and organic. From a distance of half a century, those may look like halcyon days but they were just the opposite. Wages were insulting, tied cottages were demeaning, living conditions were primitive and working conditions foul. Today the farms of Britain may be larger than Oxfam finds picturesque but our industry is successful, dynamic and incredibly productive. Which explains why I am proud to be a big farmer. PS: For those who were wondering, my subsidy cheque last year amounted to \u00a3170,523.90p.
