First, that he is by some distance the most impressive candidate from four weeks of Classic trials. Second, that it is still more probable than not that when the first nose crosses the line at Epsom a week on Saturday, it will be attached to something other than the favourite . Punting folklore has it that before Shergar's Derby in 1981, someone went into their local branch of Barclays, got a banker's draft for \u00a310,000 and went straight into the betting shop next door to put it on the favourite. As it turned out, the money was probably in more danger sitting in the bank, but while favourites have a decent overall record in recent Derbys, short-priced favourites do not. In the last 20 years, six horses have started at 2-1 or less in the Derby, but only the first two of those - Reference Point at 6-4 in 1987 and Nashwan at 5-4 two years later - came home in front. The last four - including the odds-on shots Tenby in 1993 and Entrepreneur in 1997 - have been beaten. Authorized too may well be an odds-on chance when the stalls finally open a week on Saturday, as the fragility of horseflesh is one of the variables that is factored in to his current price. History, though, demands that punters consider the reasons why Authorized might not win before they call their bank manager. There are so many, in fact, that they can be collected under three general headings: the track, the race and the horse himself. The track includes the going - which these days is usually well watered - but also the unique challenge of Epsom itself. Chester and Lingfield both stage trials on tracks that bear some resemblance to Epsom, yet many Derby contestants are more used to the relatively flat terrain of Newmarket when it comes to both racing and early-morning exercise. We all remember the childhood sensation of running down a hill just a little faster than your legs can manage, and plenty of horses hate it when they do it for the first time. It was the downhill run to Tattenham Corner, for instance, that proved too much for Tenby. \"He didn't act, as simple as that, he just hated coming down the hill,\" Pat Eddery, who rode him 14 years ago, said yesterday. \"He never gave us any indication at all that he wouldn't handle it, but as soon as we went from the mile pole onwards he just couldn't do it at all, he was all over the place. \"You've got to have a special horse to go around Epsom, especially when it's quick ground too, though they put a lot of water on these days and it's usually really good ground. It's never hard any more, not like it used to be, and the favourite really should cope with it okay. \"But the Derby is a funny race. Every year when you look from first to last at the finish line, you'll see them really strung out up the track. It's a race that can either make or break a horse.\" As for the race itself, there will be several runners in the line-up who were born to race over a stiff 12 furlongs, and will get the chance to do so in the Derby for the first time in their lives. Any one of them could improve by 10lb or more, which would put them within catching distance of Authorized. Then there is the chance of traffic problems as \"social\" runners drop away coming down the hill, not to mention the possibility - slight, perhaps, but there none the less - that Frankie Dettori's desperate need to win the Derby will be a hindrance rather than a help. Dettori's frantic left-hand drive on Swain in the 1998 Breeders' Cup Classic, which may well have cost him the race, remains a textbook example of a rider appearing to panic under pressure. He has also matured considerably in the nine years since, though, perhaps as a result of the plane crash in 2000 that nearly took his life. It will be a huge surprise if nerves get the better of him on Derby day. And so to Authorized himself. His stamina seems assured - although you can never be entirely sure that a horse will stay 12 furlongs until he does. But he is also by Montjeu, whose offspring are notorious for their little quirks of character. He seemed relaxed in the preliminaries at York last week - most un-Montjeulike, in fact - but his composure might yet crack in the cauldron of Epsom. All these issues need to be considered and then either absorbed into calculations or dismissed before anyone can consider a bet on Authorized at his current odds. Indeed, the ideal moment to back him might be in-running, when you are sure that he has gone to the start without sweating up and he has already come down the hill. At the two-furlong pole, say, when he is already three lengths clear. But by then, of course, the price will have gone. Manduro masterclass Manduro, an impressive winner at Newmarket last month, recorded his first Group One victory at the seventh attempt yesterday with an easy success in the Prix d'Ispahan at Longchamp. Manduro stretched clear of the field with ease at odds-on, and is now on course for the Queen Anne or Prince Of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot. Coquerelle, from Jean-Claude Rouget's yard, took the Group One Prix Saint-Alary with Christophe Lemaire in the saddle, and the same team also took the Prix Vicomtesse Vigier with Lord Du Sud. The winner is entered in the Gold Cup at Ascot, but needs soft ground to produce his best form. Street Sense, the Kentucky Derby winner, was beaten in the final stride by Curlin in the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico on Saturday night, meaning that America's wait for a Triple Crown winner will enter its 30th year. Ron Cox's tip of the day: Rocknest Island 5.10 Musselburgh This filly has shown improvement since returning from a spell jumping during the winter and can notch her third victory in four runs today. After winning over an extended two miles at Wolverhampton last month, she was unfortunate not to follow-up in a messy race at Catterick a fortnight later. However, she made amends over two miles at Newcastle last week and can defy a 6lb penalty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
