Inspired by his renowned work with children, they asked him to make a film about the plight of the millions of Ugandan children orphaned by Aids. The answer was yes, and in the process Kiarostami abandoned not only 35mm - taking with him just hand-held digital video cameras - but also most of his recognisable ways of working. Almost nothing in this movie announces Kiarostami as its author, apart from the unmistakable appearance in shot of the director himself, wearing his ever-present sunglasses. Instead, much of this could be the work of any film-maker who has used the new generation of DV cameras, and experienced the dizzying possibilities of auto-focus, auto-light exposure and internal steadicam. There are long shots from the car window at street scenes and long meandering takes in the market, particularly of children, who can be madly excited by turning the camera's little screen round completely so that they can see themselves. Many of the images here of women and children are very familiar from all sorts of documentaries about Africa. It seems that, like many another visitor with a camera, Kiarostami was entranced by the children's energy, radiant good humour and courage. As a self-confessed novice in Africa, he has not yet developed his own way of representing it, so some might be disappointed at the lack of anything really distinctive. Given, moreover, that his last feature, The Wind Will Carry Us, evoked such complex ideas about film-makers descending on other cultures, it may even look a little naive. But there are moments of great power. At the end of his visit to a children's hospital, Kiarostami finds a dead child being wrapped in a blanket and watches as the small figure is placed on the back of a bicycle and wheeled away through the matter-of-fact crowds. If that was fiction, it would be a climactic moment; as fact, it imposed a chill on the screening audience. Effective it certainly was. There is stark beauty in Kiarostami's filming a thunderstorm from his blacked-out hotel room, and grim poetry in some incidental brooding about malaria: \"Dying from Aids is a consequence of a choice made in life; dying of an insect bite is the ultimate betrayal.\" This is a minor Kiarostami work, but watchable - and valuable. \u0095 For news and reviews from the Cannes film festival go to Guardian Unlimited Film"}, "isHosted": false}}}
