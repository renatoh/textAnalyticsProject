I've been thinking about my future for a long time and the key thing for me was, am I going to be around in 2012? I've been doing the job for nine years and I know in my heart of hearts that I neither should, because it's not healthy, nor probably could, be around in another six years. Had it not been for 2012, my plan was to go after the Beijing Olympics. I decided that if I was going to go, I should go sooner rather than later.\" The former 5,000 metres world record holder plans to stay on for another six months while a replacement is recruited, but the timing of his announcement comes following a period of criticism which has seen the Great Britain team suffer their worst performance in the European Championships since 1978, and the appointment of Linford Christie as a mentor, despite him having previously tested positive for anabolic steroids. Moorcroft, 53, originally joined the former British Athletic Federation just weeks before it went bankrupt and was forced to oversee the resurrection of the sport under a new governing body with just six employees, who had been evicted from their previous headquarters. UK Athletics now employs more than 100 staff across the country, has an annual income of \u00a318m, another \u00a320m of legacy funding from the government and a \u00a350m sponsorship deal with Norwich Union during the build-up to 2012. \"I am proud of the UK Athletics I am leaving behind,\" he said. \"Athletics now has the system, funding, facilities and, most importantly, the people in place to take the sport into the next phase of its development. It has also been hugely encouraging to see a number of young, talented athletes emerging on the international scene over the last year.\" It must have seemed to Moorcroft that he has spent the past nine years fire-fighting a series of crises ranging from several of Britain's leading athletes being banned for the steroid nandrolone and the embarrassment of Britain having to give up the right to host the 2005 world championships after the government failed to keep its promise to build a stadium, to dissatisfaction among the country's 1,800 clubs who believe too much power is rooted at the centre of the administration. But athletics would find itself in a far worse position today if it had not been for Moorcroft's leadership. \"He came into UK Athletics at a very difficult time for the sport and leaves it financially in a much healthier state, and with our next generation of young stars performing well in Gothenburg and at the world junior championships in Beijing,\" said the sports minister Richard Caborn. It is unclear what Moorcroft will do next but the search for his successor starts immediately. Steve Cram, the former mile world record holder, would appear ideally suited to the role having earned valuable sports administration experience in his role as chairman of the English Institute of Sport. But he ruled himself out immediately. \"I'm not interested now or in the foreseeable future,\" he said. The most popular candidate among many within the sport would be Jon Ridgeon, the 1987 world 110m hurdles silver medallist who is now the managing director of Fast Track, the sport's marketing agents. \"Who wouldn't want to be chief executive of a sport which is the Olympics' premier attraction?\" he said. Another candidate could be Geoff Wightman, a former international marathon runner and lawyer who is the chief executive of Scottish Athletics. Sebastian Coe is another whose name is certain to be floated around, but he has already indicated that he is not interested because he wants to concentrate on organising the 2012 games."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
