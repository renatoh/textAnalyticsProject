Now, having taken her final exams and returned home to London, Levey has a plan. This September, she will enrol on an MSc in organisational psychology at London's City University, joining the 40,000 UK graduates who embark on a master's degree every year. Levey admits that continuing the student lifestyle was an attraction. \"A lot of my friends are going on to do a master's, and I think we're all quite happy to remain students for a bit longer,\" she says. But her main concern was long-term career prospects. \"I hope that the MSc will prepare me for job-hunting. In my third year at uni, I had a really inspiring tutor who sparked my interest in organisational psychology. One of the main attractions of my course is that it features leading professionals, providing ample opportunity to understand the areas of work I'm most interested in.\" Financial rewards Since master's courses are not centrally funded, they cost considerably more than undergraduate studies, and vary from one institution to another. But the new breed of career-savvy students are viewing this as an investment in the future. Levey dismisses fears about increased difficulty finding work in the face of global economic uncertainty, seeing a master's as a step towards improving job-market credentials. Levey's course will cost around \u00a37,000. \"It's a lot of money, and as a trade-off I'll be living at home to save on living costs,\" she says. \"But I'm trying to see it as an investment in my career that will ultimately reap a much bigger reward.\" Employability is the buzzword for many master's applicants, and their faith is backed up by statistics. A 2007 survey by the Higher Education Careers Service Unit (Hecsu) reports lower rates of unemployment among postgrads. Where 6.2% of first-degree graduates remained unemployed six months after graduating, that figure was 4.2% for postgrads. Indeed, some master's are almost workplace prerequisites. The government is so keen for new teachers to have the postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE) that it provides bursaries of \u00a36,000-\u00a39,000. In competitive industries like the media, MAs can be used to stand out from the pack. For politics graduate Katie Baneth, 22, an MA was important to put her on track for her dream career as a journalist. While studying at Nottingham University, Baneth worked at BBC Nottingham, where a news editor advised her that an MA in broadcast journalism would be the best route to working in the media. Baneth is now coming to the end of her master's at City University, which she describes as a \"competitive, cut-throat environment with great facilities and intensive training\". \"The MA offered great opportunities,\" she says. \"One of the best times was when [news anchor] Jon Snow walked into our class - we had no idea he was coming. I also gained work experience at BBC News and met industry figures including Alan Johnston and Jeremy Paxman. But I found the journalism department disorganised - they had been known to lose projects - and, considering the \u00a36,000 cost of the course, I had hoped for smaller classes and more individual training. \"There were a few sponsorship schemes, but I was self-funded. While the MA was expensive, it was worthwhile. I skipped jobs such as being a runner, and now have a freelance contract working at Five News and a casual contract at BBC News. Both opportunities came about through work experience, but it's unlikely I would have been offered either position without my accredited master's.\" For some students, a master's offers a way to defer a concrete career decision while simultaneously boosting skills. Alice Ferns, 20, has a place on Oxford University's master of studies in American literature course, but is unsure of her future path. \"Getting a job is not really a factor in my decision to do the master's,\" she says. \"I try not to think too far ahead. In the future I'm considering an art course, literary journalism - or becoming a cabinet-maker. They are varied plans, but so many people have degrees these days that any extra qualification gives you the edge.\" The UK's most popular master's remain management and business courses: the Higher Education Statistics Agency reports that 7,044 postgraduates reached master's level in business and management studies in 2006. Lydia Katz, 20, from Brussels, in Belgium, will be one of those this year. The Oxford finalist will begin a master's in management at the London School of Economics in September. \"In continental Europe, it is more common to continue studying after university,\" says Katz, who is currently finishing her degree in politics, philosophy and economics. \"All my friends at home in Brussels will be doing master's courses, so it was expected that I would, too. \"My career ambition is to work as a manager in a multinational company. I hope the LSE course will be much more practical than my undergraduate degree. I also applied to two universities in Paris. But I chose to study in London because I like the English education system - it's much more proactive on the student's part. It's a very expensive course - fees are \u00a317,500 a year - and living costs are high, too. But I think the master's will be worthwhile because my starting salary will be higher with a postgraduate degree.\" Relevant courses The value of a master's will differ for individual employers. Rebecca Fielding, finance director of the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR), says that its members view the benefits of MAs in different ways. At Heinz, where she is talent director of UK and Ireland operations, Fielding says a relevant master's in a subject such as marketing is well-regarded, but \"a generic degree in something like peace studies will not provide significant advantage\". Fielding adds: \"Academic achievement does not affect starter pay - salaries are based on individual performance. But we do see workplace benefits of MAs, particularly business courses. Individuals with an MA in business from a great institution will have stronger awareness of the wider commercial market, our competitors and innovation - and that would feed into performance. \"Because of these kinds of attributes provided by MA study, we sometimes provide sponsorship and day release for employees to embark on a master's if it is relevant to the business or to their future career. One graduate joined us in sales and we sponsored his MA in business. We saw added value in his project work, particularly in broader knowledge and expertise, and promoted him.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
