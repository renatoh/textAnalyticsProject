It was the first open revolt inside Old Trafford against the manager and the stifling style he has imposed on Manchester United. Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, now faces an unavoidable question: is this finally the time to sack Van Gaal? United have been here before. On Boxing Day Van Gaal and his side left Stoke City having lost 2-0 and he teetered on the brink. Chelsea arrived at Old Trafford two days later, 0-0 was the result, but United at last had a real go and Van Gaal limped on. Limp is an apt description of the manager, the football, and how United continue to fare in these post-Sir Alex Ferguson times. Ferguson retired in May 2013 and United have still not adjusted. Only when the first trophy is won since their former manager waved goodbye will the club feel it has. When United drew against Chelsea it was the start of a five-game unbeaten run which allowed Van Gaal to regain some of his cocksureness but the team remained unconvincing. The 1-0 victory at Liverpool on 17 January was a lucky smash-and-grab affair. It was a match they could have lost. The same failings were apparent in this dour encounter, and when the debutant Charlie Austin rose on 87 minutes to head beyond David de Gea it underlined them. Until then United\u2019s goalkeeper had hardly been called into action and the same could be said of Fraser Forster at the opposite end. Yet again United managed only one shot on target \u2013 a tame Daley Blind effort. This is patently not good enough and seems beyond forgiveness for the 20-times champions. Yet this was the second consecutive match in which United had but a single effort, Wayne Rooney\u2019s winner at Anfield being sufficient to take the points last time. This is one of a stack of remarkable statistics Van Gaal is responsible for. Another is that the 0-0 scoreline at half-time made it an 11th consecutive first-half with no United goal at Old Trafford, a run stretching back to late September. In the second half Matteo Darmian was taken to hospital with a suspected rib injury, the Italian spitting blood into the turf following a collision with Shane Long. Van Gaal chose to point to this when asked if he requires better players. \u201cWe are now missing five full-backs and I have to solve that problem every week, but still we could have won,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what I have seen. OK, for the fans it was a poor performance, because you have seen two teams who were very busy with the tactics, but they don\u2019t create many chances, and that\u2019s why it was a poor match. But still, we could have won this match, and I had the feeling we could do that also in the final minutes.\u201d The could-have, should-have defence of the team\u2019s performance holds little water. Van Gaal was hired to eradicate the what-might-have-beens. The task is clear: turn United into an unforgiving team of serial winners. He is failing. \u201cWe didn\u2019t create any chances,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cFirst, you have to create chances. In the matches before we have created chances and I have said we have to finish the chances, but today we did not, and there is a reason, because the opponent plays very compactly and there is a lot of defenders behind the ball. Then it\u2019s more difficult, as it is for every club.\u201d These sound like more excuses. The unavoidable truth is that under the 64-year-old United are a stop-start team offering scant hope to their fans, and that Champions League qualification is in peril. Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s victory over Crystal Palace stretched their lead in fourth place to five points. Leicester City, who are supposed to crumble sometime soon, also won and are 10 points better off. \u201cWe started this year very well but when you have a setback like this \u2026 \u201d said Chris Smalling. \u201cWe should have walked off with a goalless draw and both teams will be disappointed because neither team deserved to win.\u201d This last sentence is a sign of defeatist times at United. It is the club\u2019s culture now and Van Gaal is surely not going to change his modus operandi. Austin said: \u201cTo come on and get my chance, I\u2019m just delighted to score on my debut.\u201d Delight, joy, fun: any emotion derived from feeling carefree is not to be found at United these days. Is the only way of fixing it to dismiss Van Gaal? Over to you, Mr Woodward. Man of the match: Charlie Austin (Southampton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
