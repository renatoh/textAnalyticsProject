Behind him will sit critics on the right and even to the left of the party, and he will have to deliver a fiscal message that sounds fresh after its key themes, housing, skills and a modest injection of resources for the NHS have already been briefed out. It is a budget that many on his own side thought he would not give. During the general election campaign, when the assumption was that May would increase the Conservatives\u2019 majority and embark on a brutal reshuffle, Hammond appeared anything but secure. The catastrophic election result may have saved him at that point, by weakening the prime minister\u2019s hand so much that she felt unable to carry out anything but the most cursory change of personnel. But Wednesday may nevertheless be Hammond\u2019s last chance at the dispatch box. He already has to contend with the avowed hatred of many Brexiters, and isn\u2019t helped by a prickly personality (\u201che makes himself very difficult to like\u201d, says one senior Tory) and a series of recent missteps (\u201cthere are no unemployed people\u201d, he told Andrew Marr on Sunday). Hammond has deliberately styled himself as a classic iron chancellor, safeguarding the nation\u2019s finances against the flights of fancy of profligate colleagues. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson \u2013 a fan, despite being on the other side of the Brexit divide \u2013 privately describes him as, \u201cthe grey lord\u201d. An excoriating recent Sun column from the prime minister\u2019s former righthand man Nick Timothy told the same story, accusing the chancellor of blocking a slew of progressive policies. \u201cHe lacks a burning desire to change people\u2019s lives for the better, and imagination to see possibilities beyond how the world works today,\u201d it claimed. Government insiders say May isn\u2019t quite as exasperated about her chancellor as her former aide; and the prime minister herself, as an old-style shire Tory, is the block on more radical reforms such as loosening planning controls on the green belt. But Wednesday is Hammond\u2019s moment in the limelight; and younger Tories, who faced a rough ride on the doorsteps during the general election, when Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s anti-austerity message was setting the political weather, would like to see him deliver a budget that definitively marks an end to seven years of austerity. Ben Bradley, who won the marginal seat of Mansfield in June, and was one of those who went in to lobby the chancellor personally in advance of the budget, said: \u201cReally what I wanted from him is what the narrative is around appealing to working age people and those people who turned away from us.\u201d He says the cuts agenda that George Osborne used to great effect is no longer the right message for 2017. \u201cWe backed ourselves into a corner by talking about all borrowing as a negative thing. Borrowing to invest is not the same as borrowing to pay the bills,\u201d he says. As well as housing, he cites education and skills as crucial. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to invest some money in fixing some stuff.\u201d Though he adds: \u201cHe\u2019s normally a cautious fella so I don\u2019t expect it to go as far as I would like.\u201d Bradley\u2019s view reflects interventions from several senior Conservatives, most notably the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, who called for borrowing of up to \u00a350bn to invest in housing \u2013 a demand that appears to have fallen on deaf ears in the Treasury \u2013 and former minister Nick Boles, whose new book advocates ending austerity. Ryan Shorthouse, director of Bright Blue, the liberal Conservative thinktank, says: \u201cPhilip Hammond is a fiscal hawk. But even within the parameters of public spending, there could be big shifts, and he could be bold.\u201d He suggests cutting stamp duty to aid first-time buyers; cancelling planned inheritance tax cuts; and reversing some of the cuts to universal credit made by Osborne in 2015. \u201cI think he does need to be bold for political reasons, but also for fairness reasons,\u201d he says. George Freeman, the reform-minded former chair of the prime minister\u2019s policy board, has stepped aside from the role after unleashing a series of salvoes about the need for a rethink. Former minister Robert Halfon has called for the Conservatives to get back to espousing aspiration \u2013 even calling for the party\u2019s logo to be replaced by a ladder. Even if he pleases Tory radicals, the chancellor will face another tough audience in some Brexiters, who regard him as too Eeyorish about the prospects for Britain outside the EU. They will be listening to the mood music on Wednesday carefully, and he is likely to be as upbeat as he thinks he can be. Hammond\u2019s first budget, back in March, unravelled within days as it became clear the national insurance rise for the self-employed would be sunk by a backbench backlash (and, as it turned out, No 10 was clearing the decks for a general election). Few chancellors could survive botching a second."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
