The Australian lost the Cincinnati Masters final to Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets but claimed the scalp of world No1 Rafael Nadal in reaching Sunday\u2019s decider. It is hard to believe just over two weeks ago Kyrgios was forced to retire hurt down 6-3, 3-0 to world No105 Tennys Sandgren due to a shoulder injury in Washington DC. Kyrgios went down to seventh seed Dimitrov 6-3, 7-5 on Sunday, unable to maintain the form which saw him beat Nadal in the quarter-finals. But he heads to Flushing Meadows after wins over former world No.3 David Ferrer in the final four and world No13 David Goffin, Alexandr Dolgopolov and Ivo Karlovic in the early rounds. \u201cLooking back from where I was ... I would have never thought I would have had my first Masters 1000 event final,\u201d Kyrgios said. \u201cSo I\u2019m pretty happy with the result. From where I was to here, it\u2019s just been amazing. \u201cFirst round was really a struggle and obviously got through a tough one with Dolgopolov. Gradually, I just feel back to where I should feel on a tennis court. I wasn\u2019t enjoying it at all, didn\u2019t want to be out there. External things were affecting how I was feeling. It really didn\u2019t make sense. Right now, I lost today but I feel great. I feel great where I\u2019m at right now.\u201d Kyrgios was no match for Dimitrov, who did not lose a set on the way to winning his first ATP Masters tournament. The 22-year-old Kyrgios, ranked 23 in the world, capitulated with three double faults in the second set at 5-5 to hand Bulgarian Dimitrov a decisive break. Kyrgios had the first break point of the match at 2-2 in the first set, but sent a forehand wide to blow the chance. Dimitrov, however, took full advantage of his one break opportunity when Kyrgios netted a forehand to take a 4-2 lead. Kyrgios showed his frustration by remonstrating with the chair umpire during the second set over line umpiring. He hit 15 aces to six but was weaker on serve throughout, winning only 36% of points on his second-serve in the second-set. After a rain delay caused him to complete two matches in a day, he did not have the fitness to go with Dimitrov. \u201cI was struggling a couple of weeks ago and he got me out on the practice court. We practised for an hour-and-a-half and I was struggling and he was fresh,\u201d Kyrgios said. \u201cYou had me mentally today already. I was like, \u2018I know this guy\u2019s fitter than me\u2019.\u201d Kyrgios has not won a tournament this year, suffering four first-round exits since May \u2013 three of them due to injury retirements. The US Open will begin on 28 August in New York."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
