The New Labour project was rooted in the belief that Labour could ditch clause IV, and commit to an anti-working class neoliberal agenda, secure in the fact that, in Peter Mandelson\u2019s words, the working class had \u201cnowhere to go\u201d. The 2015 general election saw the end result of this when Labour suffered what Jon Cruddas then called its \u201cworst defeat since 1918\u201d. By region, Ukip\u2019s biggest gains were in the Labour heartlands of Yorkshire and the north-east, and across the north Ukip averaged 16.9% in Labour-held seats. The EU referendum result could be predicted from the 2015 pattern. Paul Mason\u2019s call, quoted by Cruddas, for Labour to now build around \u201cthe globally oriented, educated part of the workforce\u201d is calling for it to do what it already does. 2 Cruddas says, rightly, that \u201cpolitical parties do not just exist to chase votes\u201d. But Labour under Corbyn fails as a political party on any other terms. It is clear from the fact that the Brexit project was engineered by Boris Johnson, Farage, Rees-Mogg et al that it is intended as a post-regulatory anti-worker race to the bottom, but Corbyn\u2019s strategy is built around reading Harold Wilson\u2019s biography to see how Labour fought the battles of 1975. The pervasive myth that, under Corbyn, Labour has been transformed into a reforged social movement runs parallel to the delusion that Corbyn has been vigorously arguing for some putative radical agenda to unite the working class across the Brexit divide. Had Corbyn forcefully highlighted in 2016 the likely impact of Brexit on British industry, on growth, and hence on working-class living standards, we may have then avoided the turmoil of the subsequent years. As it stands, even those of us who support remain have to accept that instead we have been forced into the same position as pro-Europeans faced in France re the 2005 European constitution referendum \u2013 telling a disenchanted section of the working class that they will be made to keep voting until they get it right. Some of the blame for this must lie with Corbyn\u2019s passive approach to opposition. Nick Moss London \u2022 As an erstwhile colleague of Jon Cruddas at Warwick University I was pleased to note that his thoughtful article contained far less spin than the offbreaks he used to bowl for the university staff cricket club. However, over and above his analysis of shifting demographics and the tactical need to forge electoral alliances across classes, there is a fundamental political principle that he himself articulates perfectly: \u201cPolitical parties do not exist just to chase votes. They are traditions built around competing theories of justice and democracy \u2026 [which are] at the heart of the party regarding its character and purpose; even existence.\u201d In 1975, like the leader of Cruddas\u2019s party, I tramped the streets (of Coventry) in the campaign to withdraw from what was then the EEC, supposedly in pursuit of the Bennite demand to \u201cregain parliamentary sovereignty\u201d but, probably like Corbyn too, more inspired by the far-left slogan to \u201cSay \u2018No\u2019 to the bosses\u2019 Common Market\u201d. But that was then and this is now. And, unlike Corbyn, I can appreciate that, imperfect though it may be, the primary overarching vision of the EU is not economic but political; and that in a world now dominated by nationalists, populists and isolationist anti-democrats in the mould of Trump and Putin, Labour is nothing if not internationalist. As the deputy leader of the Labour party to his great credit continues to insist, Labour\u2019s core \u201cvalues are as the party of remain\u201d. Professor Rob Burns Professor emeritus of German studies, University of Warwick \u2022 Jon Cruddas is correct to recognise the \u201crole work plays in our lives\u201d. But his article fails to acknowledge the conditions in which a great deal of paid work now takes place (zero-hours contracts, low pay) and the existence of work that is not paid \u2013 notably the work of care. This harking back to a view of work that is essentially derived from ideas about a male, manual working class (even as that had anachronistic features at its time) ties Labour into a validation of a world that is as much a fantasy as those of Brexit and Farage. Cruddas is right to reject what he describes as ideas about \u201cnetworked youth\u201d but wrong in assuming that the politics and the very culture of class that he validates should be the basis for progressive politics. Resistance to the current insecurities of paid work, the ongoing refusal to see unpaid care as work and the denial of material support to the vulnerable are part, with forceful policies to prevent environmental degradation, of the building blocks for policies of socially equitable politics. It is these realities \u2013 as well as the impact of more tolerant social values \u2013 that Labour needs to confront and assert, rather than its current Faustian pact with those noxious and reactionary policies that are drawn from that same deep well of nostalgia, dreams of imperial power and entitlement. Mary Evans Patrixbourne, Kent \u2022 John Cruddas\u2019s article was thoughtful but didn\u2019t really convince. Working-class voters are indeed a declining element of our politics and have been for decades \u2013 I tend to agree with Paul Mason that to survive the party has to reach out to our growing support in the big cities. Blair revitalised Labour when he reached out to middle-class voters and won three elections. To assume Labour leave voters \u2013 and they were only about a third of Labour supporters who voted that way in 2016 \u2013 will opt for Farage in a new election is debatable. It overlooks the fact that working-class voters don\u2019t necessarily see Brexit as their most important issue: surely Labour\u2019s policies on social and economic matters will serve as a decisive counter attraction? Supporting remain wholeheartedly offers much more relative political benefits. Bill Jones Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire \u2022 Here are a couple of simple ideas for Jon Cruddas and all who aspire to govern. Work out what policies you think will be best for the country and its people, not what is best for the Labour or Conservative parties or your own career. Explain why you think these policies would be best. Ask the people to vote for you so you can implement those policies.
