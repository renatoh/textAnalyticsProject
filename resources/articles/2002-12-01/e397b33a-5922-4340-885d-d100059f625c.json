Which is doubly strange for me, given that my childhood idea of heaven was Butlins Holiday Camp in Mosney, near Dublin. Having never set foot in the place, my childhood vision of Butlins as the ultimate summer Shangri-la rested on a single postcard image of the indoor heated pool. Everything in the photograph suggested nirvana: the expanse of blue water, the overhanging plastic plants and fake seagulls, the children bobbing in inflatable tubes overseen by a lifeguard so cool he was wearing shades indoors. Like every other Irish postcard from the Sixties and Seventies, the super-saturated Butlins image was the work of Hinde, a man who made everything he photo-graphed look otherworldly. His colour-drenched views of rural Irish idylls - whitewashed thatched cottages, red-haired colleens and happy, turf-bearing donkeys - coincided with and, no doubt, helped to create the Sixties' wave of Irish heritage tourism when 'the Yanks', as they were known throughout Ireland, first descended en masse looking for their Celtic roots. It could be argued that the three Johns - Wayne who starred in the 1952 film, The Quiet Man, Ford, who directed it, and Hinde, who built a postcard empire in its image - were the most influential catalysts of the Irish tourist industry. Hinde, perhaps unsurprisingly, was an Englishman, and thus unafraid to exaggerate what many Irish photographers choose to underplay - the otherworldliness of the landscape and the tweeness of stereotypical Irish images (donkeys, colleens, etc). He began taking photographs in the Thirties while running a travelling circus. From the start, he saw colour as a dramatic tool to capture both the vividness of his subject matter and, more importantly, the public imagination. He was, and remained throughout his working life, a populist whose approach chimed perfectly with Billy Butlin's mid-Sixties' vision of a mass leisure industry catering to a British working class emerging from the frugality of the postwar years. This wonderful - in the literal sense of the word - exhibition features a selection of Hinde's Butlins' photographs from the mid-Sixties to the early Seventies. Originally designed for mass distribution as postcards, the images offer a world that is both familiar and utterly unreal. Everything seems exaggerated but oddly everyday in the manner of a David Lynch film or the staged photographs of Peter Lindberg. A submerged man floats eerily behind glass in a heated pool, watched by a mother and child, at Butlins Ayr. A rocket-shaped monorail train transports grinning punters over the heads of swimmers at Butlins Minehead. In the background, families lounge around a giant, plastic magic mushroom. Everywhere there are signs of that brief era of Sixties' working-class affluence, from the baroque interiors - the themed Beachcomber Bar is a temple of South Sea island kitsch - to the range of leisure activities available. Pop concerts, ballroom dancing, themed bars and bingo catered to the adults, while the kids splashed in the pool, frolicked in the playground or whizzed about on miniature trains. Hinde photo-graphed it all in images that remain dazzling both in their colour intensity and their strange clarity. His deployment of colour saturation, intended, like everything else he did, to make his postcards seem more vivid and modern than his competitors', heightens this garish unreality to surreal effect. It is easy to forget that these photographs are products of the pre-irony age. Although the images were in step with technical advances of the time, Hinde remained unconvinced of their artistic worth. It was left to his heirs apparent, of which the curator, Martin Parr, is the most renowned, to rescue Hinde from the dustbin of photographic history. After working as a 'walkie' - a roving photographer - at Butlins in Filey, Yorkshire, in 1971, Parr began collecting Hinde's postcards, and eventually tracked down his elusive mentor in the late Eighties. So began Hinde's remarkable re-evaluation. Long viewed only as master of kitsch, he is now recognised, albeit posthumously, as a peerless social documentarian. On a more postmodern note, it has emerged that many of these images were not taken by Hinde, who was sufficiently wealthy from the proceeds of his postcard empire to have given up photography by 1965. Instead he employed two young German photographers, Elmar Ludwig and Edmund N\u00e4gele, as well as a British snapper, David Noble, to carry on his work. Their task was a complex one that included the setting up of the tableaux, the arranging of often large numbers of holidaymakers who would act out elements of their Butlin's experience in lounge bars, sun loungers and dance halls. Preparation and pre-lighting often took a day, and an image was captured in one shot before the impatient punters grew restless. From his studio in Dublin, Hinde oversaw the colour-separation process that, above all else, invests his work with such an unreal sheen. Aesthetically, it hardly matters who took the individual photographs. Hinde's populist vision and heightened approach to colour is at work in all of these images. At the exhibition opening, Noble confirmed an anecdote I had thought was apocryphal: the legend of the John Hinde rhododendron bush. Apparently, Hinde carried a saw in his car and if he came across a landscape he wanted to photograph, any unsightly urban object - a concrete block or a pile of rubbish - was camouflaged by a rhododendron hastily hacked from a nearby garden. Hence the appearance of rhododendron bushes on postcards of fields, bogs and beaches all over Ireland. Priceless. All of this image manipulation only adds to Hinde's late realignment as a pioneer of postmodern photography. He manages to bridge the gap between the social document and the surreal image like no other photographer. And he achieved it all by accident. The title of the exhibition, and the book that accompanies it, is from A Midsummer Night's Dream , and once adorned the neon fa\u00e7ade of the ice-cream parlour in Butlins Skegness. Somewhere between the sublime and the ridiculous, John Hinde's visionary, larger-than-life photographs continue to enthral even as the brief utopian moment that inspired them fades like a half-remembered dream.
