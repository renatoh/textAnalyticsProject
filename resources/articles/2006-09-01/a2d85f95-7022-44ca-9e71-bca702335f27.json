Merrill said it expected the Department for Transport to announce the winner of the South West Trains franchise next week, with Stagecoach the most likely winner. Whatever the outcome, Merrill believes Stagecoach can afford to return up to \u00a3460m to shareholders after the recent sales of its London Bus and New Zealand businesses. \"The most likely scenario is that it wins SWT and spends \u00a3230m on a buyback, which gives a 147p-a-share target,\" said the analysts. More intriguingly, Merrill raised the prospect of takeover activity, such as a management buyout backed by private equity or a merger with a rival such as Go-Ahead. It pointed out that Sir George Mathewson, who joined the board in June, has links with private equity \"which could suggest some interest from [Stagecoach chairman] Brian Souter in exploring the option of a deal to go private\". The shares rose 3.75p to 121.5p. Elsewhere leading shares slipped back after an early rise, as ex-dividend stocks such as Diageo and Scottish &amp; Newcastle had a negative effect on the leading index. By the close the FTSE 100 was 3.3 points lower at 5892.2. Retailers were lifted by better than expected results from Next. Half-year profits rose 3% to \u00a3179m, against market forecasts of about \u00a3162m. Investec and Seymour Pierce were both positive on the shares which climbed 129p to \u00a318.34, the biggest rise in the FTSE 100. Marks &amp; Spencer was sought after in the wake of Next's figures, rising 15.5p to 611p. There were also rumours it is planning to revalue its property portfolio. Buildings materials group Hanson jumped 27p to 677.5p as traders talked of a bid from Mexico's Cemex, which bought RMC last year. But holiday company MyTravel slumped 12.75p to 188p after it warned profits would be lower than expected, with explanations ranging from the UK's hot summer to the security alerts and high fuel costs. The news dragged down its rival First Choice 8.5p to 208.25p. Among the financials, hedge fund group Man was among the FTSE 100's biggest fallers, down 10.75p to 432.75p, after it reported that the net asset value of its flagship AHL Diversified Futures fund dipped 2.4% in the past week. But ICAP, which provides a specialist broking service to major banks, added 18.5p to 493.25p after positive noises from Credit Suisse. ICAP's chief executive Michael Spencer met the bank yesterday and gave an upbeat presentation about the short-term outlook. The danger of following a share on the back of takeover talk was illustrated again yesterday. Engineer Morgan Crucible slipped 6p to 291p after Germany's SGL Carbon - tipped as a bidder - said it did not intend to make an offer. Among the many companies reporting results, Hikma climbed 34.75p to 400p after profits at the Jordan-based generic drugmaker rose 9.5%. Consumer lending group Provident Financial added 4.5p to 627p despite first-half profits dropping 20%. Altium Securities advised selling the shares, saying there was inadequate warning on slowing growth and higher bad debts. But Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods said the company was set to float its international business in spring 2007 and suggested the shares could be worth 670p. The Restaurant Group, owner of Frankie &amp; Benny's and Garfunkel's, rose 14p to 227.75p after first-half profits rose by 16.5%. Investec, Altium and Panmure all recommended the shares. Panmure increased its price target from 250p to 265p, saying the company could benefit from a sale of its 40% shareholding in the restaurant and bar company Living Ventures. Equipment hire group Ashtead added 4.25p to 142p on continuing takeover speculation and pallet group Brambles was 12.75p better at 474.25p as courts in Australia and the UK gave permission for shareholders to vote on a proposed unification of the Antipodean and British sides of the business. Lower down the market, insurance group Windsor jumped 7p to 49.75p after the executive directors said they were considering making a formal bid approach to the company with a cash offer of 52.5p a share. Victoria Oil &amp; Gas added 2.5p to 96p after it signed a framework agreement to supply gas to a new Moscow power station that is expected to launch in 2007. Sports Cafe fell 6p to 46p, awaiting news of an offer. Dealers said a 65p-a-share deal was expected this week but the announcement had been delayed because a couple of other bidders emerged. More news is expected imminently, with optimists saying 65p was the minimum offer the company would accept. Exploration group Beowulf rose 11% - up 0.5p to 5p - after an upbeat drilling report from its gold project in northern Sweden. But Coffee Republic fell 40% - down from 3.96p to 2.35p - after the company said it had not received an approach and is not in discussions about an offer, including a management buyout. Rich seam Cambrian Mining, which owns more than 50% of the energy company Xtract, added 0.5p to 131.5p yesterday as its full-year profits nearly doubled to \u00a331m, albeit boosted by the one-off proceeds of the sale of its stake in Asia Energy. Chief executive John Byre said it was the fourth year of consecutive growth for the company, and pointed to Cambrian's ability to participate in the growing market for energy and alternative energy projects. Teather &amp; Greenwood recommended buying the shares, saying the value of underlying investments and assets equated to 157p a share. \"We maintain our buy recommendation as we expect Cambrian's investment portfolio to strongly outperform the mining sector as a whole over the year to come,\" said Teathers. nick.fletcher@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
