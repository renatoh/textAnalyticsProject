It is a staggering sum. Even so, the north-west Conservative MEP may be some way from being the worst offender. I have a suspicious mind, and it leaves me to believe that at least one other Conservative MEP will finish his second term of office next year with a family income swollen by \u00a31 million more than my own. In fact the amount may be as much as \u00a31.5 million. The MEP in question will not have a single political achievement to show for those 10 years in Brussels. Maybe a touch of jealousy can be detected here, but it is assuaged by a sense of relief. I have used my staff budget solely to pay for the people I need to help my work. I have never had to justify employment of a member of my own family. I can sleep at night. The European parliament's financial rules vary between those of mind-numbing bureaucratic complexity and simplified procedures that can channel very considerable sums into unscrupulous MEPs' pockets. Technical mistakes are not hard to make, and I have probably made some myself, but ethical judgements should not be affected. Elected representatives should be able to determine right and wrong for themselves. The test is simple: can you stand up in public and defend how you are using public money? In this instance the parliamentary authorities have acted firmly, and their actions have been reinforced by those of the Conservative party. The combination sends a very welcome message to others. Matched by equal commitments from the Liberal Democrats and Labour, it makes it very clear that British candidates standing in next June's European elections will be expected to set high standards of financial probity. If only it were the same in all other member states. In many countries across Europe the issue hardly ever arises. Italian MEPs are said to be notorious for setting up shadow companies to administer their staff budget in ways that conform with the administrative requirements but allow money to be channelled in quite different directions. Achieving a voting majority for wholesale reform of the institution's financial regimes is difficult in these circumstances. Some positive changes are in train. Payments for travel expenses that bear no relation to actual costs will end next year. Brussels-based staff will be paid directly by the parliament. Employment of family members is to be phased out. But MEPs have voted against publication of auditors' reports. By a majority our representatives have refused to insist that receipts should be kept for use of the office budget, have rejected calls for spot checks by auditors on MEPs, and have not endorsed calls for all staff to be brought under a single financial regime. There is progress but the momentum is painfully slow. The gravy train may be less rich, and for most MEPs it may seem thin gruel beside the continuing bonuses paid to bankers, but it will still provide plenty more scope for scandals and expos\u00e9s."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
