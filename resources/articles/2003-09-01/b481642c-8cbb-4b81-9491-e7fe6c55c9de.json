Giving evidence to the Hutton inquiry for the first time, the MoD's chief press officer, Kate Wilson, said her team was \"trying to encourage journalists to come to us rather than go anywhere else\". She added: \"But we could not prevent journalists ringing Dr Kelly directly.\" That is a new line of defence from the ministry, currently under fire from lawyers for the Kelly family for revealing the government scientist's name. Today's evidence focused on the apparent \"sexing up\" of the three progressive drafts of the internal MoD Q&amp;A briefings to be delivered to journalists. These progressed from initially saying there was \"nothing to be gained\" from giving the individual's identity, to a second version saying that if Kelly's name came up they would have to check with the individual before confirming it, to a final version - the one actually used - which pre-emptively told journalists that if they gave the correct name the MoD would confirm it. Ms Wilson, who is married to the MoD's private secretary, Dominic Wilson, told the QC for the Kelly family, Jeremy Gompertz, that she and Pam Teare cowrote the first two drafts, but that Ms Teare worked on the final draft with Martin Howard, the deputy chief of defence intelligence, and that this version was approved by the permanent secretary, Sir Kevin Tebbit. That puts Sir Kevin and Ms Teare back in the firing line - and both are due to give evidence again to the inquiry tomorrow. But in an apparent attempt to restore the reputation of the MoD press office, Ms Wilson was keen to point out that at no point did they volunteer Dr Kelly's name, even after it had already been confirmed to various media outlets. She said that even after the Financial Times and the Guardian had suggested the correct name, Ms Teare \"absolutely\" refused to give her permission to give the name to the Times, even though she was \"being pestered\" by a succession of phone calls from them, giving two or three names at a time. Ms Wilson also revealed the tactics used by various journalists to elicit Dr Kelly's name such as asking for the individual's initial, a description of what he looked like, and even if his name rhymed with that of anyone else in the press office. Ms Wilson was keen to emphasise that her draft of the Q&amp;A material which dubbed Dr Kelly a \"middle-ranking official\" was not a slur but in fact a bid to show that Dr Kelly was not a junior official. Under fierce questioning from Mr Gompertz as to why Ms Wilson, having already spoken to Dr Kelly once the press statement was released, did not ring him back to alert him that his name had been confirmed to the press, she replied that she thought that it was \"better to hear bad news from his line manager\". She said she had therefore spoken to the permanent secretary at the MoD requesting that his office instruct Dr Wells to ring Dr Kelly to pass that information on. At the end of the day's session the inquiry saw Andrew Gilligan's QC, Heather Rogers, in action for the first time. She cross-questioned Ms Wilson attempting to show that the MoD press chief may have forgotten any call from Mr Gilligan alerting them in advance to his Today programme story. Ms Wilson refused to budge on her initial testimony that he had indeed called on the day before the May 29 broadcast, but that was for a seven-minute conversation about cluster bombs only at the end of which had he mentioned briefly a story on weapons of mass destruction (WMD), which he said was \"not for the MoD\". Ms Wilson said she remembered the call - which was not logged - because she agreed that it was not a matter for the MoD. Ms Rogers attempted to show that WMD in general was already a major media issue with quotations from the Whitehall media monitoring unit from the night before Mr Gilligan's broadcast. These included headlines such as \"We've been conned\" and allegations from Robin Cook and Peter Kilfoyle that a statement by the US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, that WMD might never be found in Iraq had \"blown a hole\" in the government's case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
