It's a slightly uneasy blend of sporting and domestic brutality on New York's East Side, with an over-sentimental, uplifting message; but Newman brings emotional depth and physical power to the role (plus a lot of method mannerisms), with Pier Angeli his hard-done-by girl. American Gangster 10pm, Sky Movies Premiere (Ridley Scott, 2007) Scott's old-fashioned crime drama tells the true story of Frank Lucas, the 60s and 70s Harlem hood who made his fortune smuggling heroin from Vietnam in the coffins of US soldiers. Denzel Washington's superb performance as the charismatic gangster is matched by Russell Crowe as the shambling cop Richie Roberts, who doggedly tracks his quarry for years. Engrossing, but not quite the classic it wanted to be. Carla's Song 1.25am, Film4 (Ken Loach, 1996) This bittersweet cross-cultural romance works better in the first half, when chirpy Glasgow bus driver Robert Carlyle is wooing beautiful Nicaraguan refugee Oyanka Cabezas on home territory. The shift into violent central America leaves Carlyle passively observing the troubles pointed out by human rights worker Scott Glenn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
