Armed police swooped on John Allen Muhammad, 42, and Lee Malvo, 17, early this morning as they slept in their car in a rest area in Frederick, Maryland, where several of the shootings have taken place. A .223 rifle was found in the vehicle, police said. The gun fires the ammunition used in the attacks that have killed ten people and wounded three since October 2. The US president, George Bush, has been told by investigators that they are \"optimistic\" they have cracked the case, officials said. The Associated Press quoted an anonymous law enforcement source as saying: \"I'm confident that these are indeed the people. The evidence is all there and because of things we've received in the communications it fits together with evidence they've collected in the last couple [of] days,\" the source said. Some reports, quoting unnamed insiders, have said the key break was a phone call to police suggesting that investigators look into an incident in \"Montgomery\". Investigators checking the tip off matched it with a September 21 off-licence robbery in Montgomery, a city in Alabama, in which two employees were shot, one of them fatally. The Montgomery mayor, Bobby Bright, said the person who called the hotline had claimed responsibility for both the sniper shootings and the off-licence robbery. After a composite sketch of the suspect was made, the Montgomery police chief, John Wilson, said of one of the men arrested near Washington DC, \"there are some very good similarities\". But the gun used in Alabama was not the same as the one in the sniper shootings, he said. Before dawn this morning a seven-mile stretch of interstate 70, a road about 50 miles north-west of Washington, in Frederick County, Maryland, was blocked off during the arrest. A Maryland state police spokesman, Greg Shipley, said the men were arrested \"without incident\". A member of the public had spotted a dark coloured Chevrolet Caprice with New Jersey number plates, matching the description of a vehicle police were looking for. In another development today FBI agents 2,000 miles from the sniper shootings entered a rented home in Tacoma, Washington, with metal detectors and chain saws. The agents carried away a tree stump from the garden, and other potential evidence related to ammunition in a large van, a senior police official said. Mr Muhammad is believed to have served in the army at a base near Tacoma and to have lived in the house. Mr Moose had issued another direct message overnight to the sniper before the two arrests. \"You asked us to say: 'We have caught the sniper like a duck in a noose'. We understand that hearing us say that is important to you',\" Mr Moose said. \"Let's talk directly. We have an answer for you about your option. We are waiting for you to contact us.\" The duck reference is apparently from a folk tale in which a rabbit tries to hunt a duck with a noose, but the duck wins out and flies off dragging the rabbit behind him. The latest message believed to be from the killer was a letter found near where the bus driver Conrad Johnson, 35, was shot on Tuesday, sources said. The message reportedly demanded $10m (\u00a36.5m) - the same request sources say was made in a previous letter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
