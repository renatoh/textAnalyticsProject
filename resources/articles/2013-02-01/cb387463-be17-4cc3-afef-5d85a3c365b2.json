Malcolm Layfield, head of strings at the RNCM, is being investigated by police over sexual relationships he initiated with a string of pupils at the college as well as Chetham's school of music in Manchester and the Wells Cathedral School in Somerset, the Guardian understands. In a statement on Tuesday evening the RNCM said: \"Professor Malcolm Layfield has left his post as Head of School of Strings at the Royal Northern College of Music, his position at the College having become untenable.\" The development came as almost 200 former students and teachers from Chetham's school of music in Manchester have signed a letter demanding that senior staff explain the apparent \"severe failure of the school system to protect its pupils from those who exploited their positions of power\". The Manchester private school has been at the centre of an ever-widening abuse investigation since a former head of music, Michael Brewer, was convicted earlier this month of indecently assaulting a teenage pupil. The Guardian revealed on Monday that nine current or former teachers from Chetham's and the nearby Royal Northern College of Music are now considered \"key\" suspects by police. Wen Zhou Li, a violin teacher at both institutions, was arrested last week on suspicion of rape before being released on police bail. He is currently suspended from work pending the investigation. The letter, which will be printed in Wednesday's Guardian, has been signed by about 550 people in total, including many major figures in the classical music world. It demands a \"full independent inquiry\" into allegations of widespread sexual abuse, which would ideally be broadened out to other specialist music schools and conservatoires. Among the signatories are the classical pianists Paul Lewis, Tim Horton and Peter Donohoe, all Chetham's alumni; along with the internationally renowned cellist Steven Isserlis, the tenor Mark Padmore, the violinist Lisa Batiashvili and the conductor Daniel Harding. Another high profile signatory is Martin Roscoe, who resigned from the Royal Northern College of Music in 2002 over the appointment of Layfield as head of strings. When it emerged Layfield was the favourite for the job, Roscoe warned the then-principal, Edward Gregson, that Layfield had a reputation for starting inappropriate sexual relationships with pupils aged as young as 16. Gregson appointed Layfield regardless. In a statement to the Guardian last week, Gregson defended that decision on the grounds that the \"inappropriate conduct\" took place from \"the early 80s to the early 90s\". He also stressed that he did not condone Layfield's past behaviour, but said there was no evidence that Layfield posed a threat to students in 2002. The Guardian letter, which accuses Chetham's of an \"alarming lack of responsibility\", was signed by 198 former Chetham's pupils. Between them they attended the school from 1964 right up to 2002. It says: \"The prevalence of sexual abuse which appears to have continued unhindered over many years suggests an alarming lack of responsibility and competence in the management of a school which had, above all, a duty to protect the welfare of its students and to nurture the artistic potential of every pupil. That Chetham's appears to have failed in this respect, and with such devastating consequences for the personal and professional lives of the alleged victims, now requires some considerable explanation from those who held senior positions of authority.\" The letter also asks for a \"full independent inquiry into the alleged sexual and psychological abuse by Chetham's staff since the establishment of the institution as a music school in 1969\". It adds: \"Such an inquiry would ideally extend to other institutions as well, some of which have also been the subject of allegations of abuse.\" This week it emerged that the current headteacher at Chetham's, Claire Moreland, had written to parents about the investigation. In an email she promised to commission an independent review once the police investigation was over. \"Dear parents and carers,\" Moreland wrote. \"As half-term approaches, I am sure you will be talking with your sons and daughters about the difficult events of the last few weeks and the ensuing media attention. \"With that in mind I would like to let you know that we have invited Manchester city council children's services into the school after half-term to carry out a collaborative review with us of our safeguarding policy and procedures. We welcome this visit which will take place during the week beginning 4 March. It is an opportunity for the school to demonstrate that we have robust policies and procedures in place which are applied routinely and rigorously. \"We are confident that students are well protected. This has been borne out by inspections carried out by various government bodies in recent years. As you are aware, our procedures are also annually reviewed and approved by the governing body and have been regularly and independently reviewed by Ofsted and the independent schools inspectorate. Once the police investigation into historical allegations has concluded we will of course be instigating an independent review of past events.\" The letter makes no explicit mention of Brewer's conviction, nor the suicide of his victim, Frances Andrade, who killed herself halfway through the trial."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
