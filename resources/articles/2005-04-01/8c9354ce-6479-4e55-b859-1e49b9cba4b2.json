At some point you're going to get laughed at", "bodyText": "Like most normal men, I have a mortal dread of clothes shops. I won't buy anything. I won't try anything on. My London shopping trips always end in defeat at Selfridges, with its entire, vast designer floor dedicated to the man who has been everywhere and hates everything. By the time I arrive home empty-handed, I have trudged round Gap (too cheap), Nicole Farhi (too dear), French Connection (too up itself), M&amp;S (too depressing), Habitat ('Do you sell clothes?'). I hate being stalked by 'helpful' assistants secretly wondering whether I might not be happier at Mister Byrite. I hate unisex shops that amuse themselves by watching me browse through the girls' blouses. I hate seeing my legs in mirrors. I hate it all. Yet one must dress. And it's not as if I don't like clothes, even if they do look better on other people. Robert Elms, in his entertaining book The Way We Wore (Picador \u00a312.99), an account of his lifelong fetish for what he calls 'correct attire', enthuses in obsessive detail about male styling since the Sixties, from mod to mohican to Madchester to man at Armani. He drools over the beautiful handmade suits currently hanging in his wardrobe and the contents of his underwear drawer (white cotton boxers, sourced from a small company in the Midlands, not only clean but still in the wrapping ). He talks about French vents and channel seams and pleats and flaps and side-adjusters as other men might discuss inverse-valve sprocket widgets or the best way to get from Basildon to Alton Towers avoiding Spaghetti Junction. Do you remember Budgie jackets and tulip collars? He does. He knows what a 'welt' is, too. He knows how many eyes are acceptable on a pair of desert boots. He admits to patrolling his dour London suburb dressed as Rod Stewart's more flamboyant kid brother. Obviously, I can't compete with that, but I suppose I could raise my game a bit, perhaps starting with what I am wearing right now. From the feet up: a pair of absurd brown Camper slip-ons that are too big for me or anyone else, bad socks, some quite decent Diesel jeans, I suppose, that I got for \u00a350 (brand new with tags) on eBay, a shrunken, faded Euro 2002 T-shirt and a toggled, beige fleecy thing from Millets that I bought in panic for \u00a37.99 when I had to go rafting last year. Admittedly, it's not a great look. You couldn't take it outside with you. What would Robert Elms make of my wardrobe? I wonder. I do have a couple of nice Paul Smith shirts, one striped, one with spots, both Christmas presents bought by me in successive years and wrapped by my wife. My two suits (grey and black) are OK but yield too obligingly to my childhood anxiety about not wanting to look smart by reverting to scarecrow mode the minute they leave the ironing board. Shoes? Well, there's a pair of black Oliver Sweeneys that I only wear at night owing to their resemblance to those favoured by flamenco dancers. I have some lumpy, liquorice-black, suede, crepe-soled Camper boots that look like, well, lumps of liquorice. Then there are my 1998 Redwings, which have been repaired so many times that one of the heels has developed an airlock that makes a farting sound when I walk. None of my shoes goes with any of my clothes. As a remedy, I have been vainly trying to find a pair of Hudson tan boots, size 8, with elasticated sides and a thin sole like the ones my friend Neil was wearing on New Year's Eve. I've got it in my head, rightly or wrongly, that these will go with both of my suits, my jeans and the olive-brown cord jacket I got for an embarrassing \u00a339 while shopping for cheap children's rubbish at Braintree 'Designer Village'. But Hudson don't do them any more. I rang their office. All their shoes now, I've noticed, have these weird turned-up toes. Who do they think we are - Aladdin? You'd imagine there must be a pair of shoes somewhere in London that would be up to the job, but of course nothing else will now suffice. These boots, which, had I seen them in the shops, I would have happily ignored along with everything else, have taken on a shining, unattainable, Platonic perfection. 'You're not having mine,' is all Neil can say. It is generally reckoned that buying men's clothes has never been so easy. Until the Next empire hit the high streets in the Eighties, most people were stuck with C&amp;A, Take 6, where I bought my wedding suit for \u00a342, or your local gentleman's outfitters. Now that men have scores of fash ion emporiums to choose from, it seems laughable that Dickie Dirts, a little shop that appeared on Westbourne Grove in the late Seventies, could become a retail phenomenon back then simply by packing the place out with Levi's and lumberjack shirts. So where did it all go wrong? As a kid, I remember being quite fashion-conscious. I had a guitar at 10 and a Beatles fringe. In the late Sixties, my big sister, who was a mod, used to cut my hair in the rough style of the Small Faces and other groovy pop groups of the era. I had a pair of pinstriped hipsters with a wide belt and some chisel-toed shoes. That was probably a high point. I ignored the later sartorial siren call of the skinheads, in their Sta-Prest and oxblood Doc Martens. I was mesmerised for a time by the local hell's angel look with its malodorous leathery filth and girl hanging on to your back, but you really needed a motorbike to pull it off properly. Following either group would have entailed getting a kicking at some point. In the end, I opted for the anti-fashion, prog-rock brigade. All you needed was to look vaguely scruffy, let your hair down and stay in your room listening to ELP or Led Zep. I ordered a purple, scoop-necked Jimi Hendrix T-shirt from the back pages of Melody Maker that I wore for about six years. With the exception of Bowie and Roxy Music, glamrock and its attendant silliness - the glitter, the platforms, the surfboard-sized lapels - was frowned upon by us 'real' music fans, as was the cacophonous fashion hell of egregious checks and voluminous high-waisted trousers in pale blues and salmon pinks that were a feature of the shameful mid-Seventies disco scene that followed. Like everyone else, I was eventually liberated from long hair and flares by the punk revolution, though, already feeling too old at 21, I preferred the New Wave that followed. I remember buying an old Elvis Costello-style 1960s suit in Edgware Road and a nar row tie. We tend now to associate the Eighties with big shoulders and City traders, but away from the power dressers, it evolved into a retro free-for-all, with the advent of pre-distressed leather jackets, white T-shirts, 501s, the brief summer Desert Rat look when long khaki shorts arrived (and regrettably never quite went away), along with 'chinos', which our fathers would have called 'slacks'. There was a bit of rockabilly going on: imported, secondhand checked shirts that you could rip the sleeves off appeared in American-style thrift shops that also sold vintage preppy jackets and baseball wear. Ray-Bans were in. Oxfam outlets were busy. I bought an old, carpet-stiff herringbone tweed coat in a Paris flea market that I couldn't move my arms in. There was a craze for pointy shoes in black or white or red that you could get at Shellys on Oxford Street. Shirts and jumpers (even chunky ones) were worn tucked in, hair was slicked back, quiffed or standing on end, shaved at the back and sides. I went to Rome and got a great shirt at Fiorucci. I see now that the reason I liked this period was that there was nothing new about it. We were just dressing up as our parents. I spent the Nineties having children and wearing vomit. I did have a long raincoat I was fond of, along with two faded sweatshirts that I'd also bought in Italy. Like other men into their forties, I felt stranded when things suddenly became 'modern' again. Cotton and wool were supplanted overnight by lighter modern fabrics. It took me a while to find out what a 'fleece' was. Clothes got tighter and had sprouted ugly, unnecessary zips, poppers, Velcro and utility pockets. I was now expected (or was I, at my age?) to untuck my shirt. I couldn't bring myself to wear trainers. Or cargo trousers. Or those things that stopped just below the knee. Even jeans became a problem item. Suddenly, nothing was safe. And still isn't. Articles are forever appearing in the fashion pages explaining why no one over 40 should wear a green shirt or espadrilles. 'The important factor for men our age,' says Neil, who works in the design world and is modern without looking like a twerp, 'is to avoid ridicule. You have to keep up with fashion to know what 17-year-olds are wearing. That way, you don't end up straying into skateboarding shops or walking about with your arse hanging out of your jeans.' Other friends are more sanguine. Tim, who I see in the school playground, shops at Gap. 'It's on the way to work,' he says. 'I go in every day. I keep a close eye on the stock rotation and if I like something I'll buy it five weeks later when it's cheaper. It's my aim never to pay full price for anything. I'm the son of a Yorkshire bank manager,' he adds, unnecessarily. Jon, another old chum, stocks up on T-shirts and jeans, worn with a plain but stylish zipper jacket. 'It's not fashionable,' he says, 'but it's not unfashionable.' It is a balancing act. Life was simpler in the Fifties, when teenagers turned into their parents and not the other way round; when dads had their suits and ties, proper leather shoes, slacks and cardigans, and couldn't be laughed at for what they wore. But do we want that? Psychologists say it's mentally healthy to embrace change, even when it doesn't want to be embraced. Which means back to the high street. I'll just slip into something less comfortable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
