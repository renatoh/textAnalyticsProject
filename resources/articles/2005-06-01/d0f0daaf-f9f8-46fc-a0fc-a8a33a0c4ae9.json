It coincided with fevered speculation that, despite what was said in the run-up to the election, record borrowing by the government last month makes it inevitable that the taxpayer will be asked to help to balance the books come budget time. As it happens, it is far too early to say whether taxes will have to go up. We are only two months into the financial year, and a lot can happen between now and next spring. The narrow point made by Balls was that Labour would stick to the rules established in its early months in government, however painful that might be. The man tipped to be a future chancellor himself was making two bigger points in his lecture in Oxford last night. The first was to dispute the notion, argued forcibly by the Conservatives, that the real sea change in UK economic policy occurred in the aftermath of Black Wednesday in September 1992. To be sure, Balls said, growth picked up and unemployment came down, but it was only when Labour announced independence for the Bank of England and enshrined the \"golden rule\" in fiscal policy that the markets and the public became convinced that politicians could be trusted. As evidence, he cited the fact that the persistent gap in long-term interest rates between Britain and her European partners - a proxy for long-term inflation expectations - only closed decisively after May 1997. So if the building-up of trust has been crucial in economic policy, has its absence elsewhere been crucial in fostering scepticism? It certainly has, according to Normanton's new MP. Voters have lost faith in food standards, post-BSE, and in pensions following the mis-selling scandal. And in Tony Blair, perhaps, over Iraq? Of that, diplomatically, there was no mention. We can, of course, draw our own conclusions. Reasons to go there Anybody who travels regularly on Britain's railways will be dismayed to learn that the network is enjoying a glorious renaissance. Our trains accounted for a billion passenger journeys last year - the highest since 1959 - and the public just keep coming back for more. The train operators' trade body, Atoc, expects a 28% rise in passengers over a decade. That can't be good for commuters on South West Trains, which is officially 105% full at peak times, or on Silverlink - which is at 104% of capacity during rush hours. In a thoughtful discussion paper to be published today, Atoc will pose a series of long-term questions on how the system can cope with the strain. These questions are difficult to ask, as the railways are rarely conducive to grown-up political discourse. Any suggestion of higher fares or priority for popular services generates hysterical allegations that rail bosses are plotting a return to the Beeching era of swingeing cuts. The transport secretary, Alistair Darling, favours road charging for motorists to discourage congestion on Britain's highways. The greens are furiously lobbying for taxes on air travel. Our travel options, therefore, appear to be narrowing. In environmental terms, the railways are an attractive and sustainable form of transport. But they are also extremely expensive: the government will spend \u00a315bn on rail over the next three years, which is equivalent to \u00a313m of subsidy per day. Darling has succeeded in restoring stability to rail in the wake of the Railtrack debacle. But the government cannot keep avoiding debate about the long-term future. We need to consider where the money should come from to provide extra capacity for more passengers: there are only two options, higher fares or more subsidy. We also need to ask if local trains, freight and high-speed, long-distance services can continue to share the same congested tracks. These are awkward questions but they need to be answered. More fights in store By all accounts, yesterday's crunch board meeting at Morrisons degenerated into a full-on pie fight even before the formal proceedings got under way. The upshot, after six hours, was the appointment of three low-key names as new non-executives and then a statement saying founder and autocrat Sir Ken Morrison and non-exec deputy chairman David Jones \"will together be interviewing further candidates for non-executive directorships ...\" This can be read in all sorts of ways. On the basis that Sir Ken thought the proposed non-execs too lightweight, and on the assumption that Jones would have resigned if they were not appointed, then this is a straight victory for the Next chairman. But what's this about further non-executives? Matching the current execs would mean appointing a further three independents - yet a 14-person board sounds madness. If Jones's real intention is a smaller board, Sir Ken will not like that one bit. This fight has another half a dozen gruelling rounds to go. You have to wonder whether the Morrison man really wants to spend his remaining years slogging it out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
