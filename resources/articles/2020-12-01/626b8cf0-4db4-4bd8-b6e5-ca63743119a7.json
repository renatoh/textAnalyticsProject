Hearn promotes Joshua and, during a media conference call, he inevitably set about boosting his fighter\u2019s economic credentials before agreeing that Fury\u2019s achievements in the ring mean that they deserve to share the proceeds. \u201cYou\u2019ve only got to look at AJ\u2019s endorsement deals and the money he makes,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cThe reason that Tyson Fury couldn\u2019t fight in December is that they couldn\u2019t generate the pay-per-view money or the American TV money that AJ can. But Tyson Fury is still a huge star and if you don\u2019t offer him 50/50 then he ain\u2019t going to take it. Do I think he should get 50/50? Commercially, no. But achievement-wise and on recent performances? Yeah, I do.\u201d Joshua defends his IBF, WBA and WBO world titles against Kubrat Pulev at London\u2019s O2 Arena on Saturday night. Pulev is a decent fighter, and one of boxing\u2019s proverbial tough nuts, but Joshua is backed so heavily that momentum for a definitive showdown against Fury continues to build. Fury became the WBC champion after his crushing stoppage of Deontay Wilder in February. \u201cOur job over the next couple of weeks is to get that [unification] fight in place,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cIf AJ beats Pulev, we want to go to the governing bodies and say: \u2018Deal agreed, contracts signed and this is the proposed date. Will you sanction it as an undisputed fight?\u2019\u201d Hearn was unequivocal that calls for the fight to be held in London need to be balanced by hard-nosed economic realities. After Joshua spoke last week about his possible willingness to accept a reduced purse to fight Fury in Britain, Hearn said: \u201cI\u2019m more brutally honest. We\u2019ll discuss with both management teams the opportunities that are out there in terms of site fees and money in the pot. AJ has consistently earned a lot of money and will he care less about the number in the pot than Fury? Probably. But he\u2019s not going to do it for half the money because it sounds nice. His team is going to make the right decision for his career.\u201d The promoter suggested that \u201ceverybody\u201d in the two camps \u201cwould prefer the fight to take place in London\u201d. He added: \u201c But we have to rely on revenue generated via the gate and not the revenue generated by a tourism board or by a government to bring an event like that to another country. It will probably be a 50% pay cut to do the fight in the UK and that\u2019s how brutal it is.\u201d Hearn suggested the ideal time to stage the fight would be \u201cthe end of May\u201d. But it is unclear whether the vaccine against Covid-19 will have been introduced successfully in the UK by then while, in the Middle East, which remains the probable location, Hearn pointed out that \u201cyou have Ramadan from April to early May.\u201d He was asked what he would do if, in an unlikely scenario, both boxers insisted that they fight in the UK. \u201cWe do it in a heartbeat. But it\u2019s not how it works in sport and especially not in the fight game. And it shouldn\u2019t. Everyone says Daniel Dubois quit, that he\u2019s got no heart [after the young British heavyweight suffered a serious eye injury and chose not to continue against Joe Joyce last month]. The other argument is: \u2018Actually, he could have lost his eyesight in there.\u2019 You\u2019re basically saying the fighter should put his health on the line without getting the maximum reward financially for that risk. If it\u2019s close, if it\u2019s marginal, all day long do it in the UK. But half the money shouldn\u2019t even be considered.\u201d Hearn believes a Fury-Joshua bout would generate sufficient interest to result in a rematch. \u201cOne of those fights, in my opinion, must take place in the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, particularly the first fight, both teams will say to me: \u2018Show us how this fight works, show us the finances.\u2019 I\u2019ll present every option to them.\u201d Before then Joshua needs to beat Pulev in front of British boxing\u2019s first crowd of the pandemic. One thousand fans will be allowed into the arena and Hearn said he is \u201cexcited but nervous\u201d about both the event and Saturday\u2019s headline fight. \u201cIf anything goes wrong it affects boxing moving forward. Listen, I\u2019m nervous about the fight. We have never seen AJ box in an environment like this \u2013 but I actually think it could suit him. But it\u2019s all the unknown.\u201d Book and watch Anthony Joshua against Kubrat Pulev on December 12, live on Sky Sports Box Office"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
