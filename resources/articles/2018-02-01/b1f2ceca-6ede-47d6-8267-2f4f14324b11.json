The victim was fatally injured in a shotgun blast at a house on the Poleglass estate. It is believed the man, who was in his 20s, was shot in the chest as he opened the door of the property at around 8pm, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland. He is believed to have been shot in front of two children. Local councillor Brian Headon of the SDLP said the entire community was in total shock over the murder. Councillor Headon said: \u201cThese are scenes that we thought we had left far behind us.\u201d He continued: \u201cThose responsible for this monstrous criminal act must be caught and they must be brought to justice. There is no room in this city or in this society for those intent on murder and mayhem and who will commit the most heinous crimes. \u201cI\u2019m calling on anyone with information to please come forward to police. These thugs cannot be allowed to bully this strong community into silence. They cannot dominate us, we cannot let them.\u201d Sinn F\u00e9in councillor Stephen Magennis said people in the area were \u201cstunned and outraged\u201d by the \u201cbrutal killing\u201d. \u201cI have spoken to some of the victim\u2019s family and friends and they are obviously devastated and in a state of shock,\u201d he added. \u201cThere can be absolutely no justification for this murder which was carried out in the most brutal fashion.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
