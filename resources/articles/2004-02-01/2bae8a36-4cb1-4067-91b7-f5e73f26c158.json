But it was fine nipping outside if it wasn't dark, or raining. As townies we were allowed to bring toilet paper, but the usual way was to use leaves. The only tap was cold, and outside; when hot water was needed it would be heated on a blackened kettle above the open fire. There were electric lights but no radiators and the stone floors were covered in homemade felt rugs. At night I went to sleep listening to the muffled sound of poteen - inflamed voices, snuggled into sheepskins that smelt of peat. That was my experience of Ireland from the age of three. My father used to take me to a farm owned by friends he had made when he decided to renounce city life and live off the land. That, of course, was in the Seventies. After two years he got bored of digging vegetables out of the freezing soil, milking cows and failing to kill chickens. He came back to London and got his rural fix every year at this West Cork farm. It was, therefore, a bit of a shock when I travelled to two spas in Ireland. Did they mean Spars (the ones that sold milk and magazines and stuff)? No. This, apparently, was going to be seriously luxurious spa-heaven. That pared-down life, where I renounced all capitalist urges and made felt hats, had been a form of luxury for me. How would it compare to getting 'the full works' in five-star luxury, I wondered? What a silly, silly question. The Park Hotel Kenmare in County Kerry is right next to the market town of Kenmare and looks out onto the bay and miles of deliciously lush hills. Kenmare is characteristically painted with every colour in the spectrum but holds one, extraordinary feature for an Irish town: there are more restaurants than pubs. A gradual gentrification has been taking place in Cork and Kerry (even my West Cork farming friends have now installed a toilet) so, although Ireland isn't considered to be a typical spa destination, the Park Hotel Kenmare's idea to build a spa caused more of a ripple than a stir. S\u00e1mas, Gaelic for 'indulgence of the senses', opened in November as 'the first destination spa in Ireland', exclusive to hotel residents. A waterfall drapes down a black wall as you enter, glass steps lead you to the underground wood-lined treatment rooms complete with fibre optic lighting and 'indoor shower gardens'. It is an Espa spa, using that company's products with professionals who have completed an Espa training programme. At other Espa spas around the world, such as Mandarin Oriental hotels in London and Miami, this degree of minimalist swankiness wouldn't receive a surprised blink, but I suspect that it might come as a shock to the hotel's regular customers. A pleasant shock. Park Hotel is a famous, traditional, cream-tea-after-a-round-of-golf type place. It's an old solid building, grand but not overtly so, where people come to step back from the twenty-first century, just as I did on the farm. But this is not peasant Ireland. Rather, Park Hotel is geared to take you back to the refined side of the nineteenth century and closet you among antiques. The co-owner, John Brenan, got very disturbed when he saw someone using a computer in the lounge and refused to talk to me until the person had packed it out of harm's way. What, then, was a \u20ac5 million (\u00a33.5m), ultra-flashy, state-of-the-art spa doing in a place like this? If the transition between old and new ruffles the brain a little, no matter. This spa would impress and destress anyone. The men and women's spas are separate. I sampled the Laconium (a Roman-style gentle sauna) and Aroma steam (complete with a serenity-inducing hunk of crystal) and then I had a fun shower that pelted out mist, tropical and monsoon rain, each with their own smell and colour. Crushed ice was on offer to rub into your heated skin. There was also an outdoor vitality pool, which unfortunately wasn't up and running while I was there. Next I was required to relax, tucked up on an olive ash day bed, while looking through glass walls beyond the trees, onto the bay and the perfectly dishevelled hills. I was disturbed from my meditations ('Oh isn't this nice, isn't this nice, this is nice') to receive a foot massage (called a 'foot ritual' as it included crystals and a cup of green tea), followed by a meltingly blissful hot stone massage, and a skin brightening facial. I've had a few professional massages in my life, but this was certainly the best. The next day was equally taxing. After a walk about Kenmare Bay where I sampled the t'ai chi on offer at S\u00e1mas, we visited another spa. Inchydoney Island Lodge and Spa, Co Cork, stands on the cusp of two snow-white sandy beaches. The hotel is a welcome haven from the crashing waves, the vicious wind, the sheets of rain. That is, unless you enter the Thalasso spa, where you are also lashed by the elements, but they are heated and controlled by experienced therapists. The spa specialises in thalassotherapy (sea-water therapy) which, to me, seemed closer to pulping than pampering. The treatment was taken up with trademark enthusiasm by the Victorians in Brighton, Bath and Margate and is designed, of course, to cleanse and rejuvenate mind, body and spirit. Thalasso opened in 1997 and is Ireland's third hydro spa. First came a sleep-inducing algae wrap - marine gloop was spread all over me, I was encased in plastic and a blanket and left like a steaming fish wrapped in foil. My second therapy was a Vichy massage. This consisted of a long shower head, the length of my body, which sprayed out hot freshly drawn sea water while a very nice girl in a swim suit massaged me. It was pleasant for 10 minutes, but the remaining 10 got hotter, until the experience turned into rather steamy discomfort. Still, it's meant to be fantastic for you. Next was a sea water hydro massage in a big bath. The treatment is called balneotherapy and waves of pressure ride up your body from your toes to your neck. It's basically a souped-up Jacuzzi. Thalasso felt like a grown-up theme park for lazy people who liked physical ordeals, but didn't want to move too much. It was slightly disappointing after I'd been spoilt by all the shimmering newness of S\u00e1mas. There were also traces of the traditional 'health farm' about Thalasso: hospital-white tiles, everything very slightly grubby. Let's say an aura of medication rather than serenity hung about the place. Three hours after my treatment, however, I felt unusually sprightly, giving me enough energy to brave the wind and walk down the expanse of beach. (The trick is not to look at the Inchydoney Lodge itself because it looks more like a council estate than a picturesque hotel). Before embarking on this holiday I was warned by a friend who is taking a massage course to approach the experience with caution. Or in his words: '... it all sounds like a load of tosh.' I answered, 'Yes probably', appalled at the suggestion that I, who was used to roughing it down the farm, castrating lambs and milking cows, could be seduced by such superficiality. But I was. I am. I have even opened my own small spa experience in my bathroom using Espa products and a rather feeble shower-head to recreate the Vichy massage. I want to go back to Park Hotel, and I'm going to write to my friends on the farm and get them to come too.
