In our business though, every week is enterprise week. A small business can't flourish without staff who are innovative, creative and unafraid of taking risks or adapting to change. One key enterprise skill is what I call an \"owner-manager\" mentality. Every owner manager worth their salt feels a deep commitment both to their business, which often borders on obsession. Whether this means insisting that every phonecall is answered properly, or that every line of a profit-and-loss sheet is triple-checked, an owner-manager feels responsible for everything that goes on. This is obviously not the easiest way to live your life; but when things go right, you feel smug, and when things go wrong, you have to be strong enough to get over it without resorting to terrible self-help books or alcohol. While braving the chaos of pre-Christmas shopping last weekend, I wondered how the big retailers could instil a sense of owner-manager responsibility in their employees. I stood in one shop with an armful of shoes to try on (I haven't started Christmas shopping for other people yet) while my kids dismantled window displays like monkeys on the roof rack of a Ford Mondeo in a safari park. The shop was full of exhausted customers and display debris, while the shop assistants were either nowhere to be seen or rummaging around behind the sales counter. A bit of owner-manager thinking wouldn't go amiss. Attention to detail and commitment to the business is integral to entrepreneurial thinking. One way of instilling this sense of responsibility and pride in a job well done is to get to people early while they're still at school. Enterprise education is celebrated during Enterprise Week, with thousands of young people and their teachers involved. When I was at school the slightest glimmer of enterprise led to a stern rebuke. But now schools are required to instil entrepreneurial instincts into their students as part of their daily education. As skills minister Phil Hope has said: \"Enterprise education is important in giving young people the right skills and attitudes they need to make them a success at work - for themselves as much as for their employers.\" But teachers have a lot on their plate. As well as the pressure of Ofsted and performance tables targeted on the magical \"five A-C passes\" at GCSE, schools have to ensure that students are responsible citizens primed for the world of work, know all about health and safety, enjoy making a positive contribution to society and are not getting themselves pregnant, infected with STIs or addicted to crystal meth. Few people, especially employers, would question the importance of enterprise skills, such as the ability to innovate, problem-solve, to have a \"can-do\" attitude and make decisions. Historically, these are all things you learned the hard way if you ran a business. Not long ago, if you asked people why they wouldn't want to set up their own business, they would say it was too risky and they didn't want the stress. Nowadays there is no such thing as a job for life, company pensions are history and all work is stressful. So, enterprise skills are a vital part of everyone's armoury. Whether you are a civil servant, a manager in a multinational conglomerate, a sales assistant or an entrepreneur, without the skills being celebrated during Enterprise Week you will find that you are fighting a losing battle in the world of work. \u00b7 Rebecca Jordan and Kirsty Weir are the authors of In Good Company, published by A&amp;C Black"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
