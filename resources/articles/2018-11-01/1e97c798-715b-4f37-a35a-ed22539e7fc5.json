Well, hopefully. The evening is not done yet, judging by this incident. Reuters report confirms the suspension BUENOS AIRES, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The second leg of the Copa Libertadores final between River Plate and Boca Juniors was suspended on Saturday after Boca players were hurt when their bus was attacked outside the stadium by River fans, officials said. \u201cOne can\u2019t play in these conditions,\u201d Alejandro Dominguez, President of the South American Football Confederation, (CONMEBOL) told reporters. The match was rescheduled for Sunday, kicking off at 5 pm local time (2000 GMT). Several Boca players were injured either by glass from broken windows or from toxic gas after River fans pelted their coach with missiles as it approached the ground, local media reported. Same time again tomorrow? Don\u2019t hold your breath. Sadly, violence is now reported as taking place in and out of the stadium though the current suggestion is the game will be played in front of a crowd and not behind closed doors. Some talk that tomorrow\u2019s game might be played behind closed doors, which seems sensible, but how to inform the River fans that they won\u2019t be able to see the greatest show on Earth? That appears to be that. It\u2019s the sensible decision, and one that should have been made hours ago, frankly. What caused sense to descend? Fighting outside the stadium might have hastened the decision. Reports suggest it will be played at 5pm on Sunday instead. Confirmed: P\u00e9rez starts. Oh my. A couple of tidbits from the excellent Daniel Edwards. \u201cThe driver of the Boca bus has spoken to press: \u2018At the moment of the attacks I fainted and the vice-president of Boca took the wheel\u2019.\u201d And this, which defies belief, but who knows at this point? Outside the stadium, there is tension, with there being reports of rubber bullets being fired. One person missing here, aside from Vladimir Putin (and Sol Campbell), is Diego Maradona. It can\u2019t be long until we get his word(s) on the matters. Legendary Paraguayan goalkeeper Jos\u00e9 Luis Chilavert, who won the Copa Libertadores in 1994 with Velez Sarsfield, has had his say. And he is not holding back. This translates as: \u201cAn international embarrassment from \u2018Corrup-bol,\u2019 [FIFA president Gianni] Infantino and his financial director [Alejandro] Dominguez are prioritizing money over health of the Boca Juniors players. That\u2019s how they kill soccer.\u201d Looks like a game is going to happen. The Late Joys tweets in: \u201cBoca and River should play to a 2-2 draw (just walk the ball into the net four times) then walk off the pitch together. Anyway, play or don\u2019t play -- wouldn\u2019t want to be a policeman in Buenos Aires tonight.\u201d The referees are now warming up. This has to be a sign the game goes ahead. Perhaps best to believe it when you see it. The conspiracy runs deep here. This will be talked of for decades. P\u00e9rez might be the key to the game being postponed. Some quotes from reluctant Boca players via Caracol Deportes. Carlos Tevez: \u201cWe are not in a position to play the game, they are forcing us to play the game. Pablo has a patch in his eye.\u201d Fernando Gago: \u201cWe were very surprised, many players suffered, we struggled to breathe. It\u2019s not the best way to prepare a game.\u201d This is getting made official now. And won\u2019t cause bad blood at all. Latest kick-off time is 7.30 pm local time, which is 10.30 pm UK time. Here is why the game goes ahead - officially, at least. Edouard emails in: \u201cHow amazing would it be if Boca came out to play and won this game ? Certainly would go down as one of the greatest wins / stories of all time\u2026 but the brain says that if they do play, it will certainly be a River win.Anyhow, I\u2019d be very curious to know what the Boca fans did to earn their suspension. Seeming as River will still play this with 100% home support and all.All in all an interesting first game of Argentinian football for me.\u201d The ban has been in place for some years now, since 2013. Violence is a big problem in Argentinian football, as the world is finding out today. An image of Boca captain Pablo P\u00e9rez\u2019s eye. Here\u2019s a video on the latest. Some details from Reuters. \u201cDue to the incidents with the Boca Juniors team bus, the game has been back an hour until 18:00,\u201d the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) said. Some reports said Argentine police fired tear gas at River fans who were throwing missiles at the Boca bus and the gas got into the vehicle. Others reported that the damage was caused by River fans. \u201cThey were throwing pepper gas, stones, everything,\u201d Clarin website quoted Juan Carlos Crespi, a member of the Boca delegation, as saying. Boca officials told reporters some of their players were not fit to play in the match. \u201cThe players are all hurt, you can\u2019t play this way,\u201d Christian Gribaudo, Boca\u2019s secretary general, said. Clarin said six players had vomited in the dressing-room after gas drifted into bus windows smashed by River fans outside the stadium. Boca and River drew the first leg 2-2 on Nov. 11. The incident occurred three years after a Copa Libertadores last-16 tie between the same teams was abandoned at halftime after Boca fans attacked the River players with pepper spray in the tunnel. River were given a bye into the quarter-finals and Boca were kicked out the competition. An email from Eugene Salorio: \u201cI\u2019m at Teatro Colon downtown. Presumably, the four busloads of riot police here aren\u2019t to maintain order among raucous opera goers.\u201d This appears to be the reasoning of why this game/farce goes ahead. The rumour mill is spinning of FIFA president Gianni Infantino getting involved, and Argentinian president Mauricio Macri, once president of Boca, also having his finger in this pie. But it seems Boca have been forced to play, and against their wishes. River did not appear too willing, either. This is the latest announcement. Vladimir Putin was supposed to be at this game. Wonder what he makes of the delay and the fuss. Fans in the stadium have been told that the game kicks off at 6.20 local time - that\u2019s 9.20pm in the UK. That seems...dubious. From The Independent\u2019s Miguel Delaney. Nobody warming up so I think the kick off at 6 idea is off. Gabriel Batistuta has had his say. Translation is: \u201cAnother opportunity lost in front of the whole world that observes us, shameful, regrettable.\u201d BUENOS AIRES - Saturday\u2019s Copa Libertadores final was postponed by an hour after an attack on the Boca Juniors team bus by River Plate fans left several players needing medical attention. It remains unclear, though, whether the game will go ahead with Boca directors reluctant for their players to be asked to perform so soon after such a traumatic event. The game had been billed as the final to end all finals but after all the excitement and all the build-up, it fell victim to the eternal curse of the Argentinian game: fan violence. As the Boca bus approached River\u2019s stadium, El Monumental, the police escort led it down Calle Monroe where it was surrounded by River fans. They pelted the bus with missiles and video subsequently released by the Boca showed at least five windows had been shattered. As police fired tear gas to dispersed the crowds some of it drifted into the bus, leaving players looking visibly unwell. Many were still coughing and retching, eyes watering, as they walked from the bus into the dressing-room. The midfielder Pablo P\u00e9rez sustained an eye injury and cuts to the arm, while two other players were reported to have required medical attention. Two hours earlier, the mood in the streets had been boisterous but good-humoured as tens of thousands of River fans, the cast majority answering the club\u2019s call for them to wear team colours parades to the ground, singing and dancing, and letting off red and white smoke bombs. With away fans banned in Argentinian stadiums, Boca fans had congregated at their stadium, la Bombonera, to watch the game on a big screen. When the sides met in the Libertadores at la Bombonera three years ago, pepper spray was fired into the tunnel by Boca fans as River players passed through, leading to the game being awarded to River. The first leg, played a week gone Sunday after a 24-hour delay for heavy rain, finished 2-2. This overhead image is striking. Some images from inside the Boca dressing room, which looks like a collection of walking wounded. It appears that the medical assessors are still working out whether the Boca players are able to play, and that\u2019s despite the stadium announcement. Boca seem unwilling to play, still. If you want to read about actual football, there\u2019s always this game in Spain, which kicked off on time and everything. That looks to be that but there may yet be a Boca protest to come and it\u2019s possible the announcement was made to calm fans in the stadium. Game on? Confusion reigns and it does seem that a decision has been made rather than delayed. Clarification on the kick-off time. That CONMEBOL statement suggests the game will kick off *not before* 6pm local time, which opens up to a cancellation or postponement. Boca do not seem to wish to play the game and one player, Pablo P\u00e9rez, the veteran midfielder, has gone to hospital. It feels like this game goes ahead because of the risk of emptying 70,000 fans on to the street, while if Boca lose there will be an asterisk against River\u2019s Copa Libertadores triumph. And overall, this is not good for South American or Argentine football on its big day out. Justin Kavanagh emails in: \u201cWell it looks like the only hero who\u2019ll be hailed in Buenos Aires tonight will be that bus driver, who must have cojones of steel to keep driving through that gauntlet with his side window shattered and breathing pepper spray. A sad night for Argentinian football.\u201d So this is confirmation that the game goes ahead at 6pm local time. Some talk that the game is now set to kick off at 6pm local time, and 9pm UK time. More when we get it. A video from inside the Boca bus. It\u2019s not looking good for the game to go ahead and with what looks like good reason. Here\u2019s some brief footage of the Boca bus being bombarded by River fans and what looks like tear gas or a water cannon being sprayed. So we await the decision on whether the game will be delayed by an hour or so - which is the least that will happen - or whether it goes on at all. Jonathan Wilson is our man on the spot. We have no teams yet, and for this reason. The tear gas that has affected the Boca players was actually sprayed by the Buenos Aires police in their attempts to disperse the crowd and seeped in through the broken windows. What was that I said about the away fans? This is what became of the bus on the way in. Look for the state of the side windows. It seems likely the game will be delayed by an hour at the least. Remember last week that it was delayed by heavy rain. Farce doesn\u2019t really begin to cover it. A translation of this tweet does not look promising. \u201cThe medical body will evaluate the state of health of the players to see if they are in a position to play,\u201d said C\u00e9sar Martucci, former leader of #Boca and close to the current leadership. #RiverBoca @clarincom\u201d The news is not good. Carlos Tevez is among the players who have come into contact with pepper spray. This is the biggest game in Argentinian football history, or club football at least. The national team has played in five World Cup finals, of course. But the hype machine is justified in this case. The first leg left this match as finely balanced as possible at 2-2; there are no away goals in the Copa Libertadores final, unlike the rest of the competition. This will be a night for heroes and villains, noise and naughtiness, and it would be little surprise if it went to penalties, in which it would be a surprise if anyone actually scored. Our snouts in Buenos Aires say the atmosphere is crackling if not a little dangerous, though an away fan ban hopefully reduces the possibility of serious trouble."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
