The majority of the Labor-Greens dominated committee want the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to investigate the energy minister and treasurer Josh Frydenberg\u2019s handling of the grasslands saga after finding it amounted to a major breach of ministerial standards. \u201cIt is inconceivable that Mr Taylor was unaware that he and his family stood to benefit directly from his actions,\u201d the interim report of the Senate\u2019s faunal extinctions inquiry states. It was tabled on Wednesday with backing from the Greens and Labor, but not from government senators, who said the opposition and the Greens had used the inquiry to make \u201cparty political attacks\u201d. In a dissenting report, Coalition senators said the \u201cevidence provided by the department confirms Mr Taylor had acted appropriately and in accordance with the rules.\u201d \u201cIn submitting this dissenting report, Coalition senators note and deplore the blatant abuse and misuse of the Senate\u2019s committee process.\u201d They said the Senate had voted multiple times against holding an inquiry into the matters detailed in the report. In July, government and One Nation senators blocked two attempts to launch an inquiry into the conduct of Frydenberg and Taylor. \u201cIt is disappointing that Labor and the Greens have seen fit to ignore the will of the Senate to hijack this inquiry for a clearly partisan political purpose,\u201d they said. The government senators said Taylor had made detailed statements to the House of Representatives and the department had confirmed compliance matters were not discussed at the March 2017 meeting. The report examines whether Taylor, when he was the assistant minister for cities, acted improperly when he asked for briefings on the listing protections for the critically endangered natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands. Taylor\u2019s family are major landholders on the Monaro plains, where the majority of these ecological communities are located, and at the time a company in which Taylor and his brothers had interests was under investigation by the federal environment department for poisoning grasslands at Corrowong. The company, Jam Land, faces potential fines of more than $10m if proved. Taylor has a shareholding through his family company Gufee and his brother Richard is a director. A Guardian Australia investigation revealed Taylor requested and was given briefings from the environment department on the grasslands protections in March 2017 and that compliance officers were asked to attend by the office of Frydenberg, the then environment minister. Frydenberg\u2019s office later sought advice on whether protections for the grasslands could be weakened and whether that could be done without making such a decision public. In its report, the committee considered evidence given by the department in public hearings, as well as email correspondence between the department and Frydenberg\u2019s office, which was released to Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws. \u201cIn considering the evidence, the committee has reached the conclusion that Mr Taylor consciously used his position as an MP and minister to make representations to minister Frydenberg that were aimed at affecting the outcome of the Jam Land compliance case,\u201d the committee states. \u201cIn doing so, Mr Taylor repeatedly failed to disclose his family and personal financial interests in Jam Land in an appropriate and transparent manner, not only to minister Frydenberg and his department but also the parliament.\u201d The committee said Taylor\u2019s behaviour constituted \u201cclear breaches\u201d of ministerial standards. It also noted that Frydenberg made no declaration to his department about Taylor\u2019s interest in Jam Land. \u201cEvidence indicates that Mr Taylor did not only fail to disclose his vested interests, but also sought to use his ministerial office and parliamentary connections to obtain special treatment for himself and his family, which is not offered to any other landholder in Australia,\u201d the report states. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It says that Taylor\u2019s claims he was acting in the interest of farmers in his electorate appear to be overstated and that individuals Taylor claimed had raised concerns, such as an unnamed farmer near Yass, \u201chave never been identified\u201d. In addition to recommending both ministers be investigated, the committee said Morrison should \u201cenforce disclosure obligations\u201d with respect to Taylor\u2019s personal and pecuniary interests and \u201cremind\u201d ministers that their office \u201cmust not be used to advance private interests\u201d. The committee has also recommended the national audit office conduct a performance audit of compliance actions undertaken by the environment department. Forty-one investigations into alleged breaches of environment law were launched by the department in 2016-17. The investigation into Jam Land has not concluded and is one of only four cases launched that year that are still ongoing. In their dissenting report, the Coalition senators labelled the recommendations blatantly partisan. \u201cThe evidence provided by the department confirms that Mr Taylor has acted appropriately and in accordance with the rules. Labor and Greens senators continuing to repeat claims and assertions for partisan political reasons do not change this fact,\u201d it said. \u201cCoalition senators deplore this inappropriate misuse of a Senate committee with a valid environmental terms of reference to be subverted for partisan political purposes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
