The problem was that I don\u2019t believe in politicians as people. I have to assume I\u2019m not alone here, what with us all being made of essentially the same stuff, living in essentially the same blighted, God-forsaken world. But I don\u2019t, I can\u2019t \u2013 and I\u2019m not being flippant here \u2013 see them as fully human. I see them as aberrations, born either with important bits missing (compassion, empathy) or dangerously enlarged (ambition, single-mindedness, appetite for power), who have over the centuries developed the perfect playground to allow them to exercise their deviant longings over the captives known as the UK electorate. When I imagine looking out through a politician\u2019s eyes, I imagine seeing thousands upon thousands of little green plastic figures where a normal person would see ... well, other normal people going about their business. In short, I am not well-placed to receive a political drama that treats its protagonists as complex human beings. It seemed set to be a fictionalisation too far. The opening quarter or so was stuffed full of exposition and stats (Conservatives 19 seats short of a majority! Lib Dems won more votes but lost seats! A pox on the first-past-the-post system! If only there were a better way! Maybe we will come back to this!) so we were up to speed with how the interregnum had begun, but after that the bloodless freaks began to swell with life and humanity, and it was most disconcerting. Bertie Carvel\u2019s Nick Clegg took \u2013 insert your own ironic comment here whenever you have a moment \u2013 centre stage, as the somewhere man (after his triumphant TV debates and the rush of popular support that followed) / nowhere man (as the actual Lib Dem votes came in) / somewhere man (as the other parties\u2019 numbers failed to add up). Suddenly a kingmaker, a player in the game, he did the best he could \u2013 playing the Tories off against Labour, trading policies, gambling that the lure of \u201cactually mattering\u201d and the promise of voting reform would persuade the party faithful to accept his compromises \u2013 while trying to ignore Paddy Ashdown (Donald Sumpter), the ghosts of Lib Demmery past and his own doubts, whispering in his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be let-down after U-turn ... What if people look back on this, at me, and they simply don\u2019t agree? What if I made a mistake?\u201d \u201cOh, go for it, Nick!\u201d you did not at all feel like shouting. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen?\u201d The rush of history didn\u2019t allow much time or space for any of them to breathe, but everything seemed to stop when Ian Grieve as Gordon Brown had to face the fact that he had been vanquished \u2013 by inches, perhaps, but vanquished nevertheless. Nothing in the previous 80 minutes of his compressed political life became him like the leaving of it, and you couldn\u2019t help but mourn what might have been. It was a political drama without cynicism, which shouldn\u2019t be possible in this day and age. No wonder it \u2013 I \u2013 felt awkward at the start. That it was both gripping and moving by the end was a triumph, even if the real life story since was ... not. Ah well. Roll on 7 May. Another chance to get it right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
