Afterwards, I drove down the motorway and spanked another woman, whom I visit twice a week. Tonight, I\u2019m having a first meeting \u2013 just drinks and a chat \u2013 with a woman who wants to be spanked. Then, tomorrow, I\u2019m driving to Plymouth to see another woman whom I discipline regularly. There are others, too. I\u2019m a graphic designer (freelance, hence the daytime freedom) in my late 40s, and I have loved spanking women\u2019s bare bottoms for as long as I can remember. I\u2019m not a sadist, or even sure it\u2019s about feeling dominant. Away from spanking, I\u2019m a light-hearted, mild-mannered chap who finds the notion of controlling or imposing my will on anyone absolutely abhorrent. I think what motivates me is the experience of doing something to another adult that ought not to be happening. Then there is the basic enjoyment of the act itself: seeing, touching, enjoying a woman\u2019s bare bottom; pinkening her buttocks with the flat of my hand. Is it a sexual release? It can sometimes lead to sex. But in truth, I\u2019m not sexually attracted to all of the women I spank. Some girlfriends have been keener than others, and I\u2019ve modified my expectations accordingly. But after 30 years of putting women over my knee, I\u2019ve come to realise that for many it proves cathartic. I\u2019ve had a lot of sex in my life, but am finding that intercourse is far less important to me than spanking. \u2022 Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours?
