At least three artists have been taken from their remote central Australian communities by a private art dealer who is forcing at least one of them to pay off debts of tens of thousands of dollars by producing new paintings, a leading Aboriginal art centre has alleged. In a letter obtained by the Guardian, the award-winning APY Artists collective from central Australia has spoken out about \u201cdamaging, dangerous, unscrupulous\u201d practices it says are happening in Alice Springs. The collective wrote to the federal minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, and the South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, pleading for help to stamp out exploitative practices known as carpetbagging, which have plagued the Aboriginal art industry for decades but are re-emerging as desert artists enjoy a new wave of artistic and financial success. Marshall\u2019s office confirmed he had received the letter and said he was \u201cvery concerned of the potential for artists on the [Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara] lands to be exploited in this way.\u201d Police and the attorney general had been made aware of the allegations raised in the letter, an SA government spokesman said. \u201cThe South Australian government is acutely aware of such unethical practices, and wants to play a key role in preventing Aboriginal artists being exploited,\u201d the spokesman said. Marshall raised unethical practices associated with Aboriginal arts at a meeting with federal, state and territory cultural ministers in Adelaide last month. Marshall has directed Arts SA to convene a meeting to further explore potential solutions to these unethical practices, the government spokesman said. The APY artists\u2019 collective alleged that the dealer had at least three high-profile artists painting for him at a property in Alice Springs. All three had major health challenges, the letter said: one has an acquired brain injury, another has chronic asthma and the third is deaf. One of these artists, it is alleged, is acclaimed painter Yaritji Young, whose works can sell for as much as $45,000. According to the letter, Young was told she had to make paintings to service a $20,000 debt to the dealer, apparently accrued by her son. \u201cThis is common practice often used by unscrupulous private dealers, locking family members of high-profile artists into a debt, ensuring that the family member [of] the artist has no alternative but to paint their way out of the debt,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe family members that have been approached \u2026 are all compromised by their own challenges, which include substance abuse, health issues and family obligations.\u201d The carpetbaggers, usually non-Indigenous men, are well-known to locals and operate openly in central Australia. Former and current APY staff said they had received death threats and experienced intimidatory behaviour. They said old people had been taken from their communities and set up at private studios to paint for days, cut off from their families. They had missed dialysis and other medical appointments, the staff said. Payments were offered for signing blank canvases, or posing for a photo next to an already completed artwork, they alleged. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The APY collective has engaged the law firm Minter Ellison to issue a \u201ccease and desist\u201d notice to the dealer, who it claimed might be breaching a contractual obligation the desert artists have to their APY art centres. \u201cWe have worked so hard to earn our current position of prestige and to earn our reputation of artistic excellence,\u201d the letter said. \u201cOur art centres are creating meaningful employment for our family members and are the only source of non-government income in our communities. We will do what is required to protect our art centres but at the moment we are sitting ducks, and are going it alone. \u201cWe need government support to stop this insidious behaviour by money-hungry self-interested private dealers.\u201d The letter was signed by 69 prominent artists from across the APY lands. The collective wants greater legal protections for Aboriginal artists and art centres. It said the way private dealers commissioned and acquired artworks must be more transparent \u201cso consumers can make informed decisions\u201d. It also asked for greater police support to help ensure the safety of elderly and vulnerable artists, some of whom require regular medical treatment. \u201cAPY art centres \u2026 are currently working with lawyers and the police to ensure the safe and timely return to community of all artists who are currently working\u201d for the Alice Springs dealer, the letter said. NT Police said they conducted a welfare check on a woman in Alice Springs, following information received from SA police, and found her \u201csafe and well\u201d. Police \u201cdetermined the incident is not as initially reported and no criminal offences have occurred\u201d, NT Detective Senior Sergeant Peter Malley said. Wyatt told Guardian Australia he was \u201cdeeply concerned about reports regarding \u2018carpetbagging\u2019 in Alice Springs and South Australia\u201d, and had asked the National Indigenous Australians Agency \u201cto look into this matter and provide me with an urgent update\u201d. \u201cThis is a very serious matter, and I welcome Premier Steven Marshall\u2019s decision to refer the matter to the South Australian attorney general and South Australian police,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cIndigenous art is an extremely important market for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, and they should be able to practice their art free from any interference or exploitation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
