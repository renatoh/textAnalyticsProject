Mr Mitchell refused, stating he was the chief whip and he always used the main gates. \"I explained to Mr Mitchell that the policy was to use the side pedestrian gates and that I was happy to open those for him, but that no officer present would be opening the main gates as this was the policy we were directed to follow. \"Mr Mitchell refused. Repeatedly reiterating he was the chief whip. My exact explanation to Mr Mitchell was 'I am more than happy to open the side pedestrian gate for you, sir, but it is policy that we are not to allow cycles through the main vehicle entrance.' \"After several refusals Mr Mitchell got off his bike and walked to the pedestrian gate with me after I again offered to open that for him. \"There were several members of public present as is the norm opposite the pedestrian gate and as we neared it, Mr Mitchell said: 'Best you learn your f****** place ... you don't run this f****** government ... You're f****** plebs.' \"The members of public looked visibly shocked and I was somewhat taken aback by the language used and the view expressed by a senior government official. I cannot say if this statement was aimed at me individually, or the officers present or the police service as a whole. \"I warned Mr Mitchell that he should not swear, and if he continued to do so I would have no option but to arrest him under the Public Order Act, saying 'Please don't swear at me Sir. If you continue to I will have no option but to arrest you under the public order act'. \"Mr Mitchell was then silent and left saying 'you haven't heard the last of this' as he cycled off. \"I forward this to you as all officers were extremely polite to Mr Mitchell, but such behaviour and verbal expressions could lead to the unfortunate situation of officers being left no option but to exercise their powers. \"I write this for your information as Mr Mitchell's last comments would appear to indicate that he is unhappy with my actions. I have recorded this fully in my pocket book.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
