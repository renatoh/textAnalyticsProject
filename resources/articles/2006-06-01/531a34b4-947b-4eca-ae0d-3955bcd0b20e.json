Undefeated in 30 races since they formed last year the British four, led by Andy Hodge, will test their new line-up against the Dutch world silver medallists who ran them to just a few feet at last month's first World Cup round in Munich. Britain's new eight also hope that home advantage will help them take back the Grand Challenge Cup from last year's winners, Germany, who also triumphed in Munich and are world bronze medallists. Matthew Wells and Steve Rowbotham take on the current world champions from Slovenia. World single-scull champion Mahe Drysdale from New Zealand is favourite for the Diamond Sculls in the absence of Britain's Alan Campbell, who is concentrating on his preparations for the final World Cup round in Lucerne. Britain's other world champions, the women's quadruple scullers stroked by two-time Olympic silver medallist Katherine Grainger, are also current World Cup leaders and should have little trouble against a domestic field. But the young women's eight, third last week in Poznan, will be strongly tested by the Dutch world bronze medallists and the USA."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
