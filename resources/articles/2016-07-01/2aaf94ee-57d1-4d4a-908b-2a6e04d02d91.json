Vine\u2019s column last appeared in the Daily Mail on 29 June, days after her husband had played a key role in the referendum victory for the leave campaign. She told her readers that Gove responded to the news by exclaiming: \u201cGosh, I\u2019d better get up.\u201d Vine\u2019s role came under scrutiny when an email to her husband was leaked in which she suggested that if he supported Boris Johnson, he should get something in writing about the role he would land in any Johnson cabinet \u2013 and that her boss, Mail editor in chief Paul Dacre, would support Gove in a leadership bid. On 1 July, the paper threw its weight behind the winner, Theresa May. This week, it was as if the columnist had never been away, with only one oblique mention of life in the Vine/Gove household since Michael was relegated to the backbenches. Instead, she led her page with her views on whether the proprietor of a seaside cafe in Suffolk was right to give a customer\u2019s child a \u201cticking-off\u201d for being noisy when the parents refused to intervene. She went on to tell actor Thandie Newton that she didn\u2019t like a picture of her breastfeeding her son wearing nothing but \u201cthe smuggest, most self-satisfied Earth Mother expression\u201d, passed comment on the size of Sir Philip Green\u2019s stomach, and commented on the tragic murder of Pakistan\u2019s social media star Qandeel Baloch, who was killed by her brother in a so-called \u201chonour\u201d killing. She saved her views on the post-Brexit fallout for the foot of the column. Under the heading \u201cPS: What really matters in life\u201d, she wrote: \u201cLast Thursday, the man of the house suddenly found himself the centre of attention. Standing on the brink of massive change, I couldn\u2019t help but be proud of the fact that he held his own throughout \u2026\u201d But the columnist was not referring to her husband; instead, she went on to describe how their son, William, had played a character called Captain Deadeye in his end-of-year school play, Pirates of the Curry Bean. \u201cSeeing my boy on stage, alongside his friends and teachers, was an immensely moving moment \u2013 and a salutary reminder that these are the things in life that truly matter,\u201d she wrote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
