Gates said Fallon had asked him for permission to retire and Gates agreed. Fallon was the subject of an article published last week in Esquire magazine that portrayed him as opposed to President George W Bush's Iran policy. It described Fallon as a lone voice against taking military action to stop the Iranian nuclear program. \"I believe he has made the right decision,\" Gates told reporters at the Pentagon. He called Fallon a very able military strategist and said he will be missed. \"I think this is a cumulative kind of thing,\" Gates said. \"It isn't the result of any one article or any one issue.\" Gates described as \"ridiculous\" any notion that Fallon's departure signals the US is planning to go to war with Iran. \"As I say, the notion that this decision portends anything in terms of change in Iran policy is, to quote myself, 'ridiculous,' \" he said. Fallon has had a 41-year navy career. He took the Central Command post on March 16, 2007, succeeding Army General John Abizaid, who retired. Fallon previously served as commander of US Pacific Command. Gates said that until a permanent replacement is nominated and confirmed by the Senate, Fallon's place will be taken by his top deputy, Army Lieutenant General Martin Dempsey."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
