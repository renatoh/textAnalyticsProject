Beyond the beaches the improbably green mountains are home to rare species of wildlife. But the dolphins of Dhofar may decide to go elsewhere when sun loungers and tower cranes line the shore. Some time in the next few weeks Sultan Qaboos bin Said is expected to issue a decree which will effectively open up the property market to foreign ownership. And the Dhofar region is set to become a tax-free tourist haven as sweeping reforms are introduced to encourage foreign investment in Oman. While there is still no personal income tax in Oman, a uniform 12 per cent tax rate for all companies registered there has recently been announced. Previously, companies with foreign ownership above 70 per cent were subject to a top-rate corporate tax of 30 per cent. There will also be tax exemptions for profits made by companies through the sale of shares. The move follows a trend in GCC (Gulf Co-operation Council) countries to open up to overseas investment. A delegation has been to Dubai to get tips on how to promote tourism in Dhofar. There are certainly lessons to be learnt from neighbouring Dubai, where foreigners can now buy freehold properties in designated areas. It's property boom time in the emirate, with grandiose developments springing up everywhere you look. More than 10,000 people have signed up to buy 2,400 apartments in Dubai's Palm Island development. And it's not due for completion until 2005. Continuing Dubai's palm theme on a grand scale, Nakheel Properties is creating the world's largest man-made islands. Shaped like palm trees, they will have 60 luxury hotels, 4,000 beachside villas and more than 5,000 flats. And work has started on Burji Dubai, set to be the world's tallest building. Although Muslims cannot pay or receive interest under Islamic law, HSBC in Dubai is now offering mortgages at 5.5 per cent. In Oman this scale of development is still a long way off. But there are plans afoot for a golf and marina development, aimed at expatriate buyers. Hamptons International and Cluttons are already operating in Muscat, and FPDSavills is looking to set up an office. Charles Weston Baker of FPDSavills used to command Sultan Qaboos's tank regiment and knows the country well. He has a soft spot for Dhofar. 'It is one of the most fascinating parts of the Arabian peninsula,' he says. 'The monsoon touches the area, making the mountains green. There's no doubting its suitability for development, and we are looking to be involved.' He says Omanis are very sensitive to the environment and is confident that the natural beauty of the region will not be spoilt. 'You will be able to buy the right to residency in the sultanate,' says Chris Steel of Hamptons International. 'People will realise that you can get a massive pad in the sun quite cheaply.' Dhofar does have a lot to offer. Salalah Airport has regular flights to the capital, Muscat, and to Dubai. Because of the monsoons, the climate is more moderate than in the north, with a steady year-round temperature of about 30-35 degrees centigrade. There are national parks, mango forests and plenty of archeological sites to visit. The Omani people are renowned for their friendliness and hospitality. Camel races and bloodless bullfights pull in the crowds. And if you are adventurous you can head off across the mountains in search of the lost city of Ubar in the desert of the 'empty quarter'. The sultanate has come a long way since Sandhurst-trained Sultan Qaboos bin Said came to the throne in 1970. Under his father's reign the country had no links with the rest of the world. Radios were banned and healthcare was practically non-existent. Anyone found outside the city walls without a lantern was shot. With the help of oilwealth, and a more enlightened attitude, Sultan Qaboos and his government have dragged the country into modern times, joining the World Trade Organisation in 2000. Like their neighbours in Dubai, where oil revenue now accounts for only 7 per cent of the emirate's gross domestic product, Omanis are now looking away from oil for their next source of income."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
