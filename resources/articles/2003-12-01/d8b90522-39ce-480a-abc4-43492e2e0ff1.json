Their latest casualty is the England centre Mike Tindall, who may have broken his leg in seizing Bath's first try yesterday. Bath's head coach, John Connolly, later reeled off a lengthy list of his other injured backs, including Mike Catt, Iain Balshaw and the South African Robbie Fleck. 'It is a real worry,' he acknowledged. 'Soon we'll be lucky to have a backline.' No doubt Bath's lengthening succession of wins will help to sooth the coach's concern. A twelfth in 13 games leaves them nine points clear and they're going to have to suffer many more injuries to have lost the top spot when the Premiership arrives at the play-offs. They've won some tough games this season when they have not played well, but this wasn't one of them. It wasn't that they didn't play reasonably well; it was just that Saracens were sometimes a parody of their mercurial selves. On paper they're a formidable collection of talents - and another exotic touch was added yesterday with the sevens wizard Richard Haughton being played at full-back. He made the crowd buzz as much as Thomas Castaign\u00e8de does, but one of Bath's tries was scored when he was robbed by stronger opponents. And although Saracens made a good few inroads, it seemed that Bath could always rely on them to drop the ball when trying some improbable, behind-the-back pop pass. By contrast, the visitors were direct, swift and well-organised. They now have a terrific axis in Martin Wood and Olly Barkley, the scrum-half's long, lateral pass being taken by the fly-half at speed, with the gainline always being carried. There seemed to be a new confidence, too, in the play of Tindall following his World Cup exploits. It showed in one fine break in which, when well inside his own half, he feinted a pass and stepped inside, taking off on a long break down the middle. And it was Tindall who was through like a shot on to a perfectly weighted grubber from Barkley. The ball seemed to bounce perfectly for him, though it later transpired that he had to twist to collect it and score, and he said he heard a crack. Only the x-ray, follow ing a long journey to Bath, would reveal the answer. Bath also lost Matt Perry with an aggravated groin injury, but got to half-time a comfortable 10-3 ahead, and then scored the killer try soon afterwards. There could be little surprise that the launching pad was another turnover. It was the hapless Haughton, under a hoist, who was dispossessed. When the ball went speedily down the line, Andrew Higgins on the far right had some space to exploit, but he must still have surprised the Saracens cover with the strength, pace and determination that took him through three tacklers to the line. Out of sight at 17-3? Not quite, against this erratic but feisty Saracens side. Moving the ball on a thinly populated blind side gave them two against two, with no cover, and when Paul Bailey shook off a key tackle the way to the line was clear. Castaign\u00e8de also scored an opportunist try as he joined a pummelling frontal attack. But in between there was a penalty try, by which Bath remained at arm's length. Mr Fox judged that Barkley had been illegally obstructed, as he grubbered to the line, and but for that a try would probably have been scored. Both conclusions seemed questionable. The question might also be asked: What if Castaign\u00e8de hadn't missed four penalties, plus a conversion from straight in front that was charged down? But for all that, Bath were well worth their win. They played as well as they had to.
