Critics say that Barr\u2019s investigation \u2013 which partially overlaps another one by the DoJ\u2019s own inspector general \u2013 will probably be used by Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign to fuel attacks on the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s critical conclusions about Russian interference in the 2016 election and subsequent obstruction efforts by the president. Some critics see it as an overtly political \u201cinvestigation into the investigators\u201d that is pandering to Trump\u2019s oft-repeated claims that his 2016 election campaign was targeted by the so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d in an effort to thwart his election. Barr\u2019s review will scrutinize the FBI and key intelligence agencies involved in the initial stages of the 2016 Russia investigation which the FBI launched as a counter-intelligence investigation to examine early signs of Russian meddling in the election. John Sipher, who served in the CIA\u2019s National Clandestine Services for 28 years with a stint leading its Russia operations, said: \u201cTrump with Barr\u2019s help is trying to craft a narrative of a coup aimed at his campaign.\u201d Sipher added: \u201cThe attorney general has shown a willingness to play ball with Trump. Barr has been willing to back up Trump.\u201d Sipher said Barr\u2019s review was \u201chunting for scapegoats\u201d. Among the key figures Trump and allies have often attacked for their roles in the Russia investigation which they vilify as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d are: former FBI director James Comey, ex-CIA director John Brennan, ex-FBI agent Peter Strzok and ex-FBI lawyer Lisa Page. Some Trump aides and allies have called on these figures to be prosecuted. \u201cEven if nothing is found they\u2019ve spun up their [political] base. There\u2019s no downside,\u201d Sipher said. Mary McCord, a former top DoJ prosecutor who led the department\u2019s national security division until spring 2017, said that launching a review into the genesis of the Russia investigation meant Barr was \u201callowing the president to have an open issue going into the 2020 elections that allows the whole witch-hunt\u201d mantra to gain traction. Trump\u2019s delight with Barr\u2019s sweeping non-criminal review, led by the US attorney for Connecticut, John Durham, has been palpable. \u201cI am so proud of our attorney general that he is looking into it,\u201d Trump has said. \u201cI think it\u2019s great.\u201d Trump\u2019s faith in Barr was also underscored when he gave him oversight of the review, passing over the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who would normally oversee such an investigation, the former FBI general counsel Jim Baker said. Coats has previously bumped heads with Trump over several national security issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a slap in the face to Coats,\u201d said Baker, who worked closely in the initial stages of the Russia investigation with Comey. \u201cA legitimate question is: \u2018Why is the AG doing this as opposed to Coats?\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the president has confidence in Barr,\u201d added Baker, who now leads the national security and cyber security program at R Street Institute, a nonpartisan public policy group. Baker noted that Trump issued an unusual and controversial executive order that gives Barr broad authority to declassify intelligence documents and make them public as part of the review. A DoJ spokesperson declined to answer several questions about the Barr-Durham review, including its expected duration. Durham\u2019s office also declined comment. In a 10 June letter to the Democratic chair of the House judiciary committee, a top DoJ official described the new review as \u201cbroad in scope and multifaceted\u201d. The DoJ letter said the goal was to \u201cmore fully understand the efficacy and propriety\u201d of the FBI\u2019s 2016 counterintelligence inquiry into Russian meddling. The FBI, the CIA and the DNI were instructed by Trump to cooperate \u2013 which all are doing. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said in a a statement he was worried Barr\u2019s inquiry could impede counterintelligence efforts to thwart more Kremlin interference, which the FBI expects again in the 2020 election. Warner said Barr\u2019s review could have a \u201cchilling effect on future counterintelligence investigations\u201d. Warner expressed worry that Trump and Barr were using their powers over national security and intelligence issues for political purposes. \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned that the president and the attorney general seem determined to weaponize and politicize intelligence that people risk their lives to obtain,\u201d Warner said. Some DoJ veterans say concerns about Barr\u2019s decision to launch his new review are misplaced, noting his deep legal background in government, including a stint as attorney general under George HW Bush . \u201cThere is no way to know now what Barr will find in his investigation or whether or how he will use this power,\u201d Jack Goldsmith, a conservative ex-DoJ official and now a Harvard Law School professor, told the New York Times. \u201cBut Barr is not someone inclined to harm our national security bureaucracy.\u201d Before Trump tapped Barr in late 2018 to replace the former attorney general Jeff Sessions, whom Trump often attacked for recusing himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation due to conflicts, Barr was well known as a champion of robust executive powers, a stance that probably made him attractive to Trump. Concerns about Barr were compounded when he sparked a separate political firestorm by issuing a misleading and short four-page summary of Mueller\u2019s report, and then taking a few weeks to release a redacted version of the 448-page document. Mueller\u2019s report provided granular details about how the Trump campaign welcomed the Kremlin\u2019s multifaceted cyber and social media disinformation operation in 2016 to help Trump, including hacking of Democratic computers by Russian agents and ads by fake groups on Facebook. The report also cited more than 100 meetings and contacts between Trump campaign aides and Russians. Kremlin interference, which initially focused on sowing confusion among voters but shifted to helping Trump defeat Hillary Clinton, was \u201csweeping and systematic\u201d, Mueller concluded. Mueller\u2019s report also documented 10 instances of possible Trump obstruction, but concluded that he lacked the power to charge the president due to justice department guidelines, while stressing that the report did not exonerate Trump. Just days later, Barr announced that since Mueller did not reach a conclusion, he felt it necessary to do so and, with help from the then deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, concluded there were insufficient grounds for charging Trump with obstruction. As Barr was launching his investigation, he raised eyebrows in congressional testimony by saying he had \u201cconcerns\u201d there might have been \u201cspying\u201d on Trump campaign members, as the president had often charged. But when pressed, Barr said he had no evidence to support Trump\u2019s allegations. Barr is \u201cplaying to conspiracy theorists by using the term spying\u201d, said Sipher. \u201cTrump and Barr are using language to confuse people rather than clarify.\u201d Other Barr testimony has raised fears he is taking political cues from Trump. At one Senate committee early last month, Barr was asked several times by Democratic senator Kamala Harris if Trump or anyone in the White House had suggested or pressured him to launch his broad review. Barr was evasive, but acknowledged there had been some \u201cdiscussions\u201d of the matter, adding that \u201cthey have not asked me to open an investigation\u201d. Ron Wyden, a top Democrat on the Senate intelligence panel, is troubled by the direction that Barr\u2019s review seems to be taking and the powers Trump has handed him. \u201cTrump has been searching for years for someone to selectively declassify intelligence and throw dirt on the Russia investigation,\u201d Wyden said in a statement. Trump, he added, \u201cwants any shred of misleading evidence that will validate his self-serving conspiracy theories. William Barr has embraced that role.\u201d Likewise, Sipher stressed that the powers Trump granted Barr to declassify intelligence seem part of a political game. \u201cBy suggesting you need to declassify materials, you\u2019re suggesting there\u2019s been criminality or improper behavior, [and] pushing the narrative of a deep state conspiracy,\u201d Sipher said. That\u2019s wrong, said Baker, saying that the FBI launched its investigation to deal with a genuine national security threat from Russia, as detailed in the Mueller report. \u201cMueller\u2019s conclusions validated our initial investigation, which was focused on Russia,\u201d Baker said, adding that Mueller\u2019s detailed report about Russia\u2019s multi-pronged interference in 2016, makes it impossible to \u201cconclude anything but this was a legitimate investigation\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
