Over 150,000 people have joined the Smiths' campaign, which they launched last December, saying that \"we pay our taxes and so should [Amazon] \u2013 please take a stand with us and tell Amazon to pay their fair share\". The Smiths decided to launch the petition after seeing MPs including Hodge, chair of the public accounts committee, attack Amazon, Google and Starbucks over their tax affairs. The MPs claimed that Amazon was avoiding UK taxes by reporting its European sales through a Luxembourg-based unit, and Hodge said that \"people want to know why companies which benefit from an infrastructure paid for by them and who are paying people low wages who receive taxpayer-funded tax credits from the exchequer are not paying their fair share\". \"Times are tough and getting tougher,\" the Smiths write in their petition. \"We face unrelenting pressure from huge online retailers undercutting prices, in particular Amazon, and it's pushing businesses like ours to the brink. But what's even worse is that Amazon, despite making sales of \u00a33.3 BILLION in the UK last year, does not pay any UK corporation tax on the profits from those sales. In my book, that is not a level playing field and leaves independent retailers like us struggling to compete just because we do the right thing.\" Back in December, \"we would have been glad with a few thousand signatures\", said Frances Smith, \"so to get almost 160,000 is just amazing. It just shows you how much people care.\" Together with Hodge and the Smiths' local MP Chris White, the couple, who run the Kenilworth and Warwick bookshops, handed their petition in to Downing Street at 11am on 24 April. \"I hope it will have an effect,\" said Frances Smith. \"At least it's showing them how strongly people feel about it \u2013 that they have to act. [And] it's making people aware of the fact that if they don't use their high street, it will be a sad day when there's nothing left.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
