Despite a hefty jump in aid last year, the international development secretary, Clare Short, will reveal that Britain gave 0.31% of gross national product in 2000. The UN yardstick is 0.7% of GNP. Ms Short will admit that Labour's commitment over the past four years has fallen well short of what it achieved in the crisis-hit 1970s, when the Callaghan government spent 0.51% of GNP in its last year. The proportion of GNP given in aid fell steadily during the 1980s and 1990s, reaching a low point of 0.23% last year. Labour has pledged to work towards the UN target, but officials of the Department for International Development believe that at the current rate of progress it could take 50 years. Ms Short fought hard for a 6% real terms increase in the aid budget during the most recent comprehensive spending review and was one of the last ministers to settle with the Treasury. In percentage terms, her department was a big winner from the CSR, though that reflects in part the comparatively small size of the aid budget alongside the big spenders such as health and education. Ms Short will say today that while the \u00a32.94bn in 2000 was the largest aid budget ever in nominal terms, and is set to rise to \u00a33.36bn by 2003/04, the government is falling a long way short of the 0.51% of 1979 let alone the UN's 0.7%. Only a handful of small, rich nations - mainly in Scandinavia - fulfil their UN commitments. Denmark, the most generous donor, spends more than 1% of national income on aid, while Norway spends 0.9%. Ms Short believes that Britain's international influence would be greatly boosted by investing the extra \u00a34bn a year needed to hit 0.7%. Because the UK is a large economy, it would make us the third biggest spender on international development. Labour has focused Britain's aid budget on achieving the global poverty reduction targets set by the UN, which include halving the number of people in absolute poverty by 2015, giving every child a primary education and reducing infant mortality by two-thirds. However, on present trends, the anti-poverty goals will not be met and Ms Short argues that she needs more resources so Britain can help complete the task. Today's figures, released by DFID, show that in the last calendar year official development assistance increased by 40%. The rise reflects the increased development budget in the government's spending review. It also reflects an increase in EC development expenditure to the poorest countries, to which Britain contributes nearly 20%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
