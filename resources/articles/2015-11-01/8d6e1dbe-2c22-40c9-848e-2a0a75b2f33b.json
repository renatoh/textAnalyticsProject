Mourinho has been given a one-match stadium ban by the Football Association after the Portuguese admitted a charge of misconduct following the defeat to West Ham, when he was sent to the stands for arguing with the referee, Jon Moss, in his room at half-time. Chelsea\u2019s narrow victory over Dynamo Kyiv in the Champions League on Wednesday relieved some pressure on Mourinho but with his side 15th in the Premier League after only three wins, another defeat could stretch the 10-point gap between them and the top four. Mourinho, who was rumoured to have hidden in a laundry bin to dodge a Uefa ban that prevented him from being in the dressing room against Bayern Munich in 2005, will have to rely on his coaching staff and senior players to provide leadership on Saturday. Matic said: \u201cOf course it is more easy when the coach is on the bench and especially at half-time, when he can say something. But we also have other great coaches, and they will be prepared for everything, and we have to be ready for that. It\u2019s going to be strange, of course. I think that I\u2019m here almost two years and we have not played without a coach yet, so it is going to be strange, but this is football and we will be ready. \u201cSometimes when the game stops and there is a foul, he shows with the hands and you know what you have to do. You can\u2019t really hear him because there are 40,000 people here, and it\u2019s difficult. Sometimes you hear him, and especially if you play on his side of the pitch.\u201d Asked if Chelsea\u2019s players would want to win for their absent manager even more this weekend, Matic added: \u201cWe want to win, and of course we want to win also for the coach, for our club, and we know that in the last couple of weeks, when everyone has been saying we are bad, we know that we have quality. \u201cWe know that it is not easy to recover from that, because when you play for Chelsea you always have more responsibility than other clubs, because Chelsea always wants to win. Our supporters are used to winning trophies.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
