He rattles it in with confidence! He\u2019ll be here for the weekend, which is a relief, scraping inside the cut, but he shot 77 today, and is pretty much out of the serious running at +4. Spieth knocks his in for birdie, and ends the day on -3 after a brilliant 70. So this is how it ends. See you tomorrow for Moving Day! -7: B Watson -4: Senden -3: Bjorn, Blixt, Scott, Spieth -2: Couples, Walker, Furyk -1: Streelman, Gallacher, Henley, K Stadler, Donaldson McIlroy sets his putt way out to the left, but doesn\u2019t read it brilliantly. It kicks back to the right, and rolls a way past the cup. He\u2019s got a real tester from five feet to save his par, and book his weekend here. But you wouldn\u2019t trust that putter to do anything. Not today. He steps up, and ... Only one group left out on the course now. Spieth, in the centre of the 18th fairway, hits his approach to the centre of the green, allowing the ball to roll back to a couple of feet. He\u2019s such a talent. McIlroy\u2019s not half bad either, he\u2019s just not been at the races today. And his approach sticks up on the back right of the green. He\u2019ll have a testing two putts downhill if he wants to stay here for another two days! McIlroy\u2019s birdie effort on 17 slips by the hole. Par. He\u2019s +4, and can\u2019t afford to drop a shot at the last. On 18, Scott splashes out to five feet, and makes his par. He settles for a level-par 72, and he\u2019s -3 at the halfway mark. And then Fitzpatrick races his par putt wide left of the cup. What a shame: he\u2019ll not be making it this weekend. Hey, he gets to watch the Blades against Hull, and he\u2019ll be back here often enough. He hugs his caddy, and looks pretty pleased anyway. As well he might. A magnificent performance by the young man, who has a great career ahead of him if this week is anything to go by. We\u2019ll be seeing him again at the Open at Hoylake. And it\u2019s not as though he\u2019s not in good company on the charabanc home: Mickelson, Els and Schwartzel couldn\u2019t do any better. Spieth needs two shots to make it to the 17th green. He\u2019s facing a long par putt up the dancefloor. He doesn\u2019t make it. Up on 18, Scott\u2019s got a shot to the green \u2013 just, though he\u2019s near a tree \u2013 and fires a low iron into the bunker front left of the green. Fitzpatrick meanwhile hits his second into the heart of the green, and it rolls back pin high. He\u2019ll have a 15-footer across the green to grab a weekend spot! What a performance! Some hot cut action. On 18, Charl Schwartzel, the 2011 champion, lets a birdie putt slide by the left of the hole. He\u2019s at +5, and his likely chance of staying the weekend appears to have gone with it. That\u2019s because Olesen birdies the last to get back to +2; Jimenez has already finished at +3. And McIlroy clips a delightful approach to 17 to within ten feet. A great birdie chance. Or, more to the point, he\u2019ll not be dropping a shot. It looks all over for the lads at +5. Scott\u2019s drive at 18 slides away to the left, and he might not have a route into the green from there, where he might possibly be snookered behind a tree. Fitzpatrick\u2019s? Straight down the middle. There\u2019s a future for this young man all right. Up on the green, Furyk hits one of those putts, and he\u2019ll have a four-footer for a par. The brilliant young amateur Fitzpatrick gets up and down from a bunker at 17 to save his par. At +5, he\u2019s still got a chance of staying for the weekend. Scott, meanwhile, sends his second pin high, but he lets the birdie putt slide past on the left. A chance to grab a share of second spot spurned. Spieth has driven into nonsense down the right of 17, while Furyk\u2019s approach to 18 isn\u2019t brilliant, out in Donaldson Country. But as we\u2019ve seen, tricky as it looks, par isn\u2019t a pipe dream from there. Here\u2019s the leaderboard: -7: B Watson (F) -4: Senden (F) -3: Bjorn (F), Blixt (F), Scott (17), Spieth (16) -2: Couples (F), Walker (F), Furyk (17) -1: Streelman (F), Gallacher (F), Henley (F), K Stadler (F), Donaldson (F) At 18, Donaldson\u2019s approach takes a flyer through the green. He\u2019ll have a real job to save par from there. But he sends it sauntering along Snedeker Street, on a huge left-to-right arc, and he\u2019ll get his four. He\u2019s -1 at the halfway mark. Spieth is not perfect yet, of course, and plops his tee shot at 16 into the bunker front left. He\u2019s pretty damn near it, mind, and splashes out cleverly, 20 feet past the hole, letting the slope send the ball back to four feet. He should save his par. And he does! Absolutely brilliant! Par for Sideshow Rory. Magnificent, quintessential Augusta entertainment here, involving Brandt Snedeker. He\u2019s hitting his approach to 18 from the right of the fairway. He clips his iron past the hole, the ball stopping 30 feet past. The crowd sense the ball\u2019s not finished, though, and eventually it slowly topples back. It rolls on what looks like an inexorable journey into the hole, but dies one dimple short right. Shame, shame, shame! He\u2019ll be tapping that in for birdie, and finishing the day at level par for the tournament. Scott, on 16, sends a decent but not brilliant tee shot into 16. He\u2019ll have an uphill 20-footer for birdie. He can\u2019t make it. He stays at -3. Up on 17, Donaldson misses a short par putt, and drops back to -1. Jordan Spieth could quite easily become the first debutant to win at Augusta since Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979. On 15, he bombs a gorgeous second shot over the water to 15 feet. What an eagle chance! And he dribbles it down the surface, a perfectly weighted putt! He\u2019s -3! McIlroy, by way of comparison, sends his approach into sand to the right. He splashes to 10 feet, but can\u2019t knock the birdie effort in. He\u2019s still on the precipice. Weekend participation is not a shoo-in. Adam Scott, big-hitting Adam Scott, was always looking to pick up shots on these par fives. And here he is, rolling a 15-footer in on 15 for birdie. That\u2019s three in four holes, and he\u2019s back to -3! What a game of two halves golf is, eh. Eh? His playing partner, young Matthew Fitzpatrick, rolls in a birdie effort himself! He\u2019s back to +5, and harbours hopes of staying here for the weekend! Meanwhile on 16, Furyk rolls in his birdie effort, and he\u2019s -2. Brilliant play all round! It\u2019s quite possible that the crowd at +5 could still be here this weekend. The top 50 rule applies, and if two more players still out on the course slip to +5, they\u2019ll all be in. It all appears to depend on Miguel Angel Jimenez, Thorbjorn Olesen at +3 \u2013 and Rory McIlroy at +4. But if we assume McIlroy, with holes still to bugger up, is one of them, then one of Jimenez and Olesen will need to drop two shots, and they\u2019ve only got three holes to play between them. I think that's right. Hm. Don't quote me. Jim Furyk! He\u2019s suddenly right in the frame, hitting a facsimile copy of Donaldson\u2019s tee shot at 16 to a couple of feet. Well, not quite a facsimile: it\u2019s the same shape, landing at the back right of the green then curling down to the hole, but he\u2019s left with a downhill putt instead of the much simpler uphill one the Welshman had. He should still convert for birdie, but you can\u2019t take anything for granted on these marble greens. A stunning tee shot at 16 from Jamie Donaldson, who lands his ball behind the pin to the right, and lets a huge smile play across his face as it turns round to the left and bends back towards the hole, stopping two feet away. That birdie will move him to -2. Furyk birdies 15 to quietly get involved. Here\u2019s how everyone\u2019s standing: -7: B Watson (F) -4: Senden (F) -3: Bjorn (F), Blixt (F) -2: Couples (F), Walker (F), Donaldson (16), Scott (14) -1: Streelman (F), Gallacher (F), Henley (F), K Stadler (F),Furyk (15), Spieth (13) Graeme McDowell won\u2019t be here this weekend. He signs for a 78, and this is the fifth time in seven visits where he\u2019s missed the cut. Rickie Fowler cards 75 today, not ideal, but he\u2019s +2 and here for the final rounds. And Walker strokes his par putt home, which gives him a level-par 72 today, and he remains at -2. Three putts for Rory, and that\u2019s another shot gone by the wayside. He\u2019s +4, and his attendance this weekend suddenly looks uncertain. He can\u2019t afford to drop any more strokes. Up on 18, Walker is unfortunate to find a divot with his drive, and duffs his approach. He\u2019s got a job on to save his par, having yet to reach the green. But he lifts a wedge over the flag, and lets the ball roll back towards the pin. He\u2019ll have a downhill tickler for par. Freddie Couples\u2019 birdie putt on 18 doesn\u2019t drop, but he scribbles his name on a 71: he\u2019s -2 for the tournament at the halfway stage. Not bad for an old-timer, huh? Meanwhile Rory does very well indeed to punch his ball violently out of a paradoxically pretty environment at 13, but it still only reaches the fringe at the back. He\u2019s in trouble still. On 15, Donaldson sends a downhill dribbler towards the hole for his birdie, but the ball stays one dimple\u2019s width out on the right. So unlucky. He stays at -1. And on 14, Scott has a job on from the back of the green, facing two putts down a glacial green for par, but he judges his first one perfectly, and he\u2019ll escape with par. Couples hammers his drive at 18 straight down the track, then lifts his second to 12 feet! What a chance he has to make a birdie that\u2019ll make his pillow seem very soft tonight. Meanwhile on 13, McIlroy\u2019s day goes from bad to farcical, as he pulls his approach left, whereupon the ball hits a sprinkler head and balloons off into the azaleas behind the green! \u201cAw no!\u201d he shouts as his hopes arc off into the filth. Apologies for the lack of communication: the Guardian computer went buggerty-jigger there, and is taking an age to restart. I\u2019m currently tapping this out on a Heath Robinson tin can contraption, involving wires and string also. Two major things we\u2019ve missed: on 17, Couples wanged his drive behind trees down the left. He fired deliberately into the bunker in front of the green, as he saw it as his best chance to get up and down. But didn\u2019t manage it: he\u2019s back to -2. So \u2013 albeit coming the other way \u2013 is Adam Scott, who booooooomed a massive drive down 13, then hit an appalling short iron straight through the green. Down the slope at the back, taking two more for birdie looked unlikely, but he managed it. His Masters challenge is back on track! As, almost, are we: Haas has birdied 14 and 15, to haul himself back to level par. Spieth can't knock in his birdie putt on 12. His partner McIlroy stroked his wedge from the tee straight over the bunker, but pushes his short birdie putt to the right. His putting has been abysmal today. He'll not be featuring on the final day. Up on 16, Walker leaves himself an almost impossible shot, sending his tee shot off the green top right. He's faced with a glacial slope, and the fringe to negotiate as well. He uses the toe-end of his putter to play what is effectively a snooker shot, teasing the ball onto the green, then watching it roll off at hysterical pace. He's left with a 15-footer for par, about as good as he could do, but can't make it. He's back to -2. The 2003 champion Mike Weir went out in 32, and was as high up the leaderboard as -3, but he ends the day at +1 after coming back in 40. That's some way to card a level-par 72! He'll be here over the weekend, though. Another dropped shot for McIlroy, who can't scramble his par from an awkward position to the right of 11. He's back to +3, and into the lake the ball goes. Flingity fling! What a fit of pique. Spieth drops a shot too, going back to -1, but comes back at 12 with a pin-high tee shot, giving himself a chance to bounce straight back. We've not heard much from Adam Scott, who has been steady since that appalling start, pars from 6 to 11. He's sure to get a birdie at 12, having lifted a stunning 9-iron to a couple of feet. And it's in: -1. Fitzpatrick's pin high, too, eight feet away! No birdie for the young man. Donaldson can't get up and down on 13: bogey. And on 16, Couples nearly drains a monster uphill for birdie, but it skates by on the right. Another par, and the 54-year-old's holding on here. A list of the oldest Masters champions: Jack Nicklaus (1986, 46), Ben Crenshaw (1995, 43), Gary Player (1978, 42) and Sam Snead (1954, 41). He couldn't blow this little lot out of the water, could he? Eh? A poor approach to 13 for Donaldson, who lays up, then sends his wedge over the back at the left. Getting up and down from there is practically a pipe dream. Up on 15, Couples trundles a birdie putt miles past the hole, but stays strong to knock in the return. He remains at -3. A word about the young English amateur Matthew Fitzpatrick. The 19-year-old is the youngest player in the field this week, and he's put up a damn fine show. He tired on the home stretch yesterday, dropping shots at 13, 14 and 17, signing for a four-over 76. But he's only one over for his round today through 10, bouncing back from a bogey at 2 with birdies at 4 and 9. This is a brilliant display. He's +5 at the moment, on the same mark as legendary figures such as Phil Mickelson and Ernie Els. He needs to pick up a shot to make the cut, as things stand. I guess if he doesn't, there's the consolation of being able to watch his beloved Sheffield United this weekend in their FA Cup semi-final against Hull City. Either way, it's been quite a week. McIlroy can't get up and down from the bank at 10, and suddenly that's a double-bogey 6, his second double of the day. All those short missed putts will hurt him now. He's back to +2, and doesn't really look in any sort of shape to challenge seriously here this week. Rory duffs his chip up the hill. The ball only makes it halfway up. McIlroy's in danger of losing the rag a bit, he seems impatient. Time to take stock and limit the damage: Bubba aside, this field is pretty tightly packed. Up on 12, the increasingly impressive Donaldson dumps his tee shot in the front bunker, but splashes out wonderfully to four feet, and taps home for his par. A spot of trouble for Rory down 10, who sends a hot approach through the green, down a hill, and onto some pine straw. What an escape this will be if he makes off to the 11th with a par. On 14, Walker creams a beautiful iron over the stick to 15 feet, but can't quite make the birdie effort. He remains at -3. Donaldson sends his drive at 11 into trees. But he's got a route to the green, and he punches a brave shot straight down the fairway, flirting with the water on the left but making the heart of the putting surface. A long two putt for par, but he gets up and down. Meanwhile Senden puts his tee shot at 18 into the trees, but manages to get his second the other side of the greenside bunker down the left. He chips over the sand to six feet, and may escape with a par that'd feel like a birdie. And it's in. He signs for a 68, and ends the day at -4, currently alone in second place. There's a fair chance, with the wind up and birdies not that easy to come by now, he'll be in the final pairing tomorrow: -7: B Watson (F) -4: Senden (F) -3: Bjorn (F), Blixt (F), Couples (14), Walker (13) -2: Donaldson (11), Spieth (9) The bogey putt of Haas at 11 slides by on the right, and he's back to level par today. This is a pretty ugly collapse. His tee shot at 12 is then taken by the wind and dumped behind the green to the left. He's lucky that isn't in the thicket. Spieth saves his par on 9 with a safe two putt. He remains at -2. McIlroy pars the hole too, but he had another chance to register a birdie there. His putter is cold. Spieth is a magnificent talent. He's behind a tree down the left of 9, but manufactures a high fade and drops his ball into the middle of the green. What a story it'd be if he could win this tournament! Up on 11, Haas chips well towards the hole, avoiding the sand trap, but he's still faced with a slippery ten footer for bogey. Up on 13, Walker is a turn away from raking home a 40-foot eagle putt, but birdie will have to do. He's back up the leaderboard to -3. Haas wangs his drive at 11 behind a tree down the left. He can only chip out, with one of those little reverse-head trick shots. He's coming off the back of two bogeys - and his third down towards Mize Country isn't going to help. He might even have to flop over the knuckle of the bunker if he wants to get anywhere near the hole. This is turning into a bit of a disaster for the overnight leader. Probably just as well we didn't emblazon this MBM with his face, huh. Couples knocks in his birdie putt. Spieth registers back-to-back birdies, this time at 8. The first debutant to win since Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979? Blixt for birdie at 18, and his effort from the front of the green stops a foot short. He taps in to sign for a 71 to go with that opening-day 70. Very solid, and he's done well after that double-bogey nightmare at 11. He's -3 for the tournament. As good a time as any for a leaderboard ... -7: B Watson (F) -4: Senden (16) -3: Bjorn (F), Blixt (F), Couples (13) -2: Walker (12), Haas (10), Donaldson (10), Spieth (8) It's not happening for Rory. A drive into trees down 8, but a good escape. However, his wedge into the green is lame, hits a bank on the right, and the ball is killed stone dead. He's got a birdie putt up the green, but it's a good 30 feet from the hole. He gives it a good trundle, but it's a couple of turns too short. Par. Up on 13, Couples lays up with his second, then bumps a brilliant third pin high, leaving himself an eight-footer for birdie. He's missed easier today. Let's hope he can knock that one in and move to -3. And back to the possibly long-forgotten Sergio In Other Sports debate. \"Poor old Serge is definitely Graeme Hick or Mark Ramprakash,\" says George Wright. \"Whenever you aren't concentrating, they're doing something amazing, like getting 100 first class hundreds, but as soon as the spotlights on them, they make an attractive 25 (or 3 under after 8) before capitulating (quadruple bogey at the 12th).\" Haas is letting it slide. He finds the bunker to the right of the green, and it's almost impossible to splash out without the ball rolling back down to the front of the playing surface. He'll be left with a long par putt. How he could do with draining it. He can't, though, and drops back to -2. Up on 18, Kevin Stadler nearly knocks in one of those long right-hand-turn putts, but settles for par. He signs for a 73 today, and is -1 at the halfway point. His dad Craig won't be competing at the weekend, but he's just drained a huge birdie putt on 15, having also birdied 12 and 13! He's still +14, but he and Kevin will always be able to say they were the first father and son to play in the same Masters. Walker looks to get his round going again on 11, and is a roll away from knocking in a 30-foot birdie putt across the green, right to left. He stays at -2. Which is where Jamie Donaldson is, after knocking in the most deserved of birdie putts. He's out in 33 strokes, as good a front nine as anyone's played today. A stunning shot from Jamie Donaldson, standing on pine needles under a tree down 9. He sends it arrowing over the bunkers guarding the green front left, dropping the ball on the back left corner and letting it curl round and dribble back to within six feet of the hole! That'll be a great chance for a birdie. McIlroy can't knock in a birdie effort at 7, staying at level par, but his playing partner Jordan Spieth can! He's -1 overall. Up on 12, Couples can't make his par putt, and drops back to -2, but he'd have taken that outcome when his tee shot was in mid air. Couples walks briskly to his ball before it can decide again and take a dip. He flips the ball onto the green, and he'll have a ten footer to save par. Even if he misses that, he'll be feeling somewhat blessed after that awful tee shot. Haas drops one on 9, chunking a short approach and failing to get up and down from the front of a very long green, the pin at the back. A second birdie in a row for Senden, this time at 14, and he's -4. But Jimmy Walker continues to go backwards. A bogey at 10, and he's -2, exactly where he was before embarking on that fine front nine. Donaldson birdies 8, and moves to -1. And it's been a lively start for Jim Furyk, the runner up at last year's PGA. Birdies at 2 and 5, and he's back to level par overall. Shades of 1992 for Fred Couples! He hits a dreadful tee shot at 12. Simply appalling. The ball hits the bank, and is certain to trickle back down into Rae's Creek... but somehow it snags in the grass and stays up! Couples went on to win the Masters that year. This couldn't be an omen, could it? Could it? Birdie for Blixt at 15, and he's not far off adding another at 16, but his uphill putt falls short. Meanwhile on 11, a wonderful up and down for Couples from just off the green on the right. He remains, like Blixt, at -3. Poulter's birdie effort at 12 horseshoes out. A great day for the US Open champion Justin Rose. Yesterday, a dreadful 76. Today, a superb 70, including an eagle at 8 and birdies at 17 and 18. He's +2 overall, and while his game, post-injury, isn't quite as polished as he'd like, this is a pretty decent return seeing he was +6 after 12 holes of the first round. Westwood's playing partner Russell Henley pushes a short birdie putt past the hole on 18, but he'll still be signing for a two-under 70. He's -1 for the tournament. Up on 12, Ian Poulter - who started like a train with birdies at 1, 3 and 5, before dropping shots at 9 and 10 - clips his tee shot to ten feet, pin high. He's +3, and needs a decent run home from here. Up on 14, John Senden rakes in a 25-footer to move to -3. Lee Westwood's not managed to get anything going today. Bogey at 3, birdie at 5, then pars all the way through 17. And then on 18, he sticks his approach ten feet past the flag, then rolls in an ersatz version of Sandy Lyle's winning putt in 1988 for a much-needed birdie. One-over par yesterday, he's one-under today, and has hauled himself back to level par. Not out of it, by any stretch, providing Bubba's momentum gets checked at some point. Rory responds brilliantly to that double-bogey blow by stroking in a 15-footer on 5 to pick a shot back up. He's level par for the tournament again. On 16, Kevin Stadler continues a crazy ride since the turn. After his double at 11, he's birded 12 and bogeyed 13 and 14. Now he's smacked a wonderful tee shot at 16 to four feet, and tapped home for a birdie. Despite it all, he's level par for his day's work so far, and remains at -2. Scott strokes in a 12-footer for par on 6. He doesn't look on his game yet today, perhaps that'll knock a few cobwebs off. A look at the latest leaderboard? Hell, why not: -7: B Watson (F) -4: Haas (7) -3: Bjorn (F), Couples (10), Walker (9) -2: Blixt (14), Senden (13), Weir (11) Mickelson is forced to set his birdie putt on 18 miles to the left of the hole, as it'll break right at 90 degrees before performing another u-turn and slip backwards to the cup. A fine putt gets him to within four feet, and he rattles home the par putt. A 73 today. But that probably won't be good enough to make the cut, unless (as things stand) seven players at +4 or above slip to +5 or below, and bring the top-50 rule into play. Also below the line: Sergio, who for the second day in a row finished bogey-bogey and signed for a 75. He, like Mickelson, is on +5. Phil Mickelson is almost certain to miss the cut at Augusta for the first time since 1997, and only the second time in his entire Masters career. The projected cut is +4, but Lefty is at +5, and has left himself a baroque 40-foot birdie putt. A triple-bogey at 12 appears to have done for him. Elsewhere, McIlroy made the right decision to take his medicine on 4. He splashed out of the sand to six feet, then tapped in for a double-bogey 5. Bad, but it could have been worse if he'd started faffing around in the trees. A wonderful 15-foot par save for Weir on 11. He was in danger of losing serious momentum there. And back on 10, Couples gives himself another chance for birdie, his approach nestling 20 feet below the cup. His effort's dead on line, curling in from the right, but not hit. Another par. If only his putter was hot. Adam Scott's day goes from bad to worse: back -to-back bogeys at 4 and 5, and suddenly the defending champ is back to level par. Pain for Jimmy Walker, too, as he flops his chip from the back of 9 onto the putting surface, then watches in horror as it does the Augusta thing of slowly, slowly, slowly rolling past the cup then speeding off down the green. He's got a 30-foot uphill putt left for par, and sends it 29 feet: he's back to -3. This golf course is not forgiving when you start making mistakes. McIlroy goes back to the tee, where he'll hit three. That stroke's dumped into the sand in front of the green. This could get ugly. Walker meanwhile in a spot of bother down 9. He sails his drive into trees down the left, then his second takes a flyer through the green. It's all the way down the back, though stopped from racing miles past the dancefloor by the crowd. Weir faffs around with the trees down 10, and ends up dropping a shot, though he's not a million miles away from draining a long par saver across the green. Rory McIlroy dropped a shot at 2, but he's picked it straight back up at 3 and is -1 for the tournament. For how much longer, though, we don't know: he's clattered his tee shot into trees down the left, and, right up against a boundary fence, is forced to take an unplayable. This has all the hallmarks of a Mickelsonesque disaster: Lefty took a triple-bogey six here last year. Up on 9, Couples hits a weak birdie putt, the ball dying left, a chance to move to -4 spurned. On 13, a birdie for Blixt, who is looking to repair the damage of 11. He's back to -2. And Jamie Donaldson has only just missed a birdie putt at 6, having picked a stroke up at 2: he's level par overall. Couples at 9. He's in the centre of the fairway, and takes one of those silky swishes at the ball with his iron. \"Big bounce, big bounce!\" he demands. And sure enough, the ball obeys, taking a couple of leaps towards the cup. He's pin high, left with a six footer for birdie. Meanwhile back on 8, Jimmy Walker fires an approach straight at the flag to eight feet, but misses the very gettable uphill eagle putt. A birdie will have to do: he's -4 for the tournament now, and justifying a lot of pre-tournament hype. True to form, that leaderboard is already out of date. Freddie Couples has birdied 8, and he's back to -3 for the tournament. And up on 18, the leader Bubba Watson sends his approach into the crowd to the left of the green. He's up on the bank, and chips brilliantly to five feet, sending his ball way out to the left of the pin, and allowing it to roll on a huge arc to the right, beyond the target and back again. Some local knowledge, right there. You won't see one of the debutants playing a chip as good as that. But he inexcusably misses the short putt, prodding it past the cup Sergio style. He's back to -7, signing for a 68 that looks just fine and dandy alongside that first-round 69. A bogey for Sergio at 17. He's back to +4, and any faint hopes of a charge in the wake of that excellent birdie putt at 11, and crisp tee shot at 12, have gone now. \"Sergio is clearly Brazil, 1982,\" argues Seth Levine. \"Easy on the eye, insanely talented, but fundamentally rubbish at the boring but quite important stuff (defending/ putting).\" On the subject of round-the-green meltdowns, Kevin Stadler was in greenside sand at 13 in two strokes, but took two shots to escape, and failed to drain a 30-footer to save his par. He's back to -2. A poor start to the round for the defending champ Adam Scott, by the way, who drops one down the 1st. Let's have a look at this leaderboard, then: -8: B Watson (17) -4: Haas (5) -3: Bjorn (F), Weir (9), Walker (7), Choi (6) -2: K Stadler (13), Senden (11), Couples (7), Scott (3) Bubba isn't the only man ripping up the course right now. The 2003 champion Mike Weir - a trailblazer for Watson, in that he was the first left-hander to win the Masters - is out in 32 strokes, having picked up shots at 2, 6, 8 and no 9. The Canadian shot a one-over 73 yesterday, flying well under the radar. He's blown his cover now. He's -3 overall, and tied for third with only Bubba and Bill Haas better off. Thanks to Rob for that. An enjoyable break, my digestion only ruined by the stomach-churning tumult of watching poor Kevin Stadler and Jonas Blixt taking turns to run up double-bogeys at 11. Blixt has dropped back to -1, but Stadler, who fell to -2, picks up a shot again at 12: he's -3. But today's all about Bubba, really, whose astonishing run of five birdies on the bounce was positively Normanesque. That's come to an end at 17, but at -8 he's got a four-stroke lead on the field. A couple of players will have to make a wee move this afternoon, if this weekend isn't going to turn into a procession. Rory McIlroy is out and has started with a routine par. After a solid opening round yesterday, he needs to start attacking these pins, whatever he thinks about the course being \"set up to curb any sense of adventure\". That's especially true now as Watson has now gone to eight undee! An incredible fifth birdie in a row for Bubba at the 16th leaves the American seven shots clear of McIlroy who is now certain to drop at least one shot at the second. Oh dear. Worrying picture of the day. Louis Oosthuizen searching for his ball at the 15th. The Bubba blitz continues, his fourth birdie in a row, this time at 15, taking the leader to seven under. Whisper it quietly, especially within earshot of Rory McIlroy, but Watson is making the old course look tame. His brilliant exhibition of precision putting has sent him three clear of the field, but it will be those further behind who will be watching on most anxiously. At one point earlier today the 10-shot rule looked like it was going to save all but 15 of the tournament starters, but no more. The last thing you want to want to be doing right now is triple-bogeying, but Mickelson has done exactly that at the 12th. The wild thing is now seven over and in serious danger of going home tonight. Evening all. A pleasure to be with you and it brings me almost as much joy to let you know that Fred Couples is on the charge again. The 54-year-old, who won the tournament back in 1992 and always seems to be knocking around the top of the leaderboard for the first two days at least, has followed up his first round 71with birdies at two and three. He says he is doing it for the 50-somethings, and who would back against him. He's now three under, three off the lead. Right, I'm off to put my face in a big bowl of the only food-flavored food item to be marketed by a talking golf glove. In the meantime, Rob Bleaney will be your trusty guide. But before I head off, here's how the leaderboard stands, with the leader Bubba having picked up his third birdie in a row, this time at 14, and the overnight leader Haas regaining the shot he dropped at the opening hole, at 2: -6: B Watson (14) -4: K Stadler (9), Choi (2), Haas (2) -3: Bjorn (F), Blixt (9), Couples (4), Walker (3), Scott Admin latest from the marker's tent. Matt Kuchar ended the day with a 71, and is level par for the first two days of work. Louis Oosthuizen, leading not so long ago, is on that level-par mark too, having finished with a bogey up 18, a dismal close to his round after that eagle at 13 was cancelled out (and then some) by a triple bogey at 15. And Branden Grace has illustrated why we all love and hate golf in equal measure, following up yesterday's nightmare 84 with a three-under 69. At +9, he'll still be going home tonight, but at least he's regained a little pride. It's all happening at the top now, where KJ Choi moves into a tie for second, following up his opening-hole birdie with another at 2. He's -4. Forgot to mention Stephen Gallacher, incidentally: he birdied 15, and eventually signed for a rollercoaster par round of 72, four birdies, four bogeys. A gentle rollercoaster, anyway. A log flume. That 72 goes alongside his opening-day 71. He's -1 the halfway mark, and nicely poised for a weekend tilt at doing what no Scotsman has done since Paul Lawrie in 1999. You know what that is. The overnight leader Bill Haas is out. And what a difference a day makes, as he drops a shot at the opening hole to fall back to -3. Or does a day make such a difference? He dropped one at the 1st yesterday, too, and went on to shoot 68. Meanwhile Jimmy Walker, with two PGA Tour events in the bag since the turn of the year already, really does fancy a third at this, his Masters debut. He birdies 2 to move to -3 overall. Bjorn gets home for his 68, but not in the easy-going manner you'd imagine: a bogey at 17, a birdie at 18. He's in the clubhouse at -3 for the tournament, two off the lead. Sheer brilliance from the Danish veteran. Speaking of veterans, Freddie's on the march. As much as a man with such insouciant elegance as Couples would ever march. Another birdie at 3, and he's -3 for the tournament too. \"Sergio = Newcastle,\" suggests Rob Hisnay. \"The 1996 Newcastle meltdown in particular. I would just love it , I mean love it, if Sergio won the Masters.\" This kind of puts his nemesis Padraig Harrington in the role of Manchester United, doesn't it. I suppose neither of them are having very good 2014s. Bubba can't make his eagle putt. It's always going to stay out on the left, but he leaves himself a foot-long tap-in for birdie, and moves to -5. He's the sole leader of the Masters. Sergio prods at his short birdie putt like a confused bonobo examining a teapot that may or may not be full of water. Par. For goodness sake, Sergio! \"Watching Sergio is like watching Jimmy White back in the day,\" sings a lyrical James Taylor. \"No matter how good he looks and how smoothly he plays, you know the easy putt when he's under pressure is going to get him in the end. What's wonderful though is that without fail he's a joy to watch, and without sportsmen like him and White, watching would be far less compelling.\" Nobody's got to -6 yet this week. The nearest we've been is Marc Leishman, who made it to -5 earlier today ... but is now +1, having recently double bogeyed 9 and dropped a further shot at 10. That's a pretty sorry capitulation. Anyway, Bubba has an eight-foot putt to reach that virgin territory, having creamed his second to 13 over the creek and into eagle range. Sergio lays up, then gives himself a decent chance for birdie with a chip that bites dead, six feet behind the hole. Two-putt birdies at 13 for two of the pre-tournament favourites, Henrik Stenson and Jason Day. Stenson is back to +1, Day +3. Neither are out of this tournament, but Day especially needs to get something going over the closing holes. Closer to the business end of the leaderboard are KJ Choi and Freddie Couples. Choi moves to -3 after picking up a stroke at the opening hole. Meanwhile our hero from 1992 birdies 2, and he's -2 overall. Sandy Lyle signed for a level-par 72 today. Not bad for the old boy, huh? He's +4, and will be here for the weekend. The projected cut will see all those at +7 and above chased away with sticks. That's no good for last week's PGA Tour winner, the Shell Houston Open champ Matt Jones: he's filed a 78 alongside his first-round 74, a total of +8. \"With all respect it can't be Arsenal,\" writes Hubert O'Hearn. \"Arsenal won Premier League titles before I started plucking grey hairs. It needs to be the individual, the one who continually threatens greatness, yet through hubris or a protruding Achilles waved insouciantly before the opposing archer's eye, is left to moan of what might have been. And that's why we love them. Arsenal can't win the League (at present) because they won't pay over market price for a striker. Well, no romance in that. But Sergio suffering sudden and unforeseen bursts of self-doubt and blame? Damn. Now that is Shakespearean.\" Bubba made a 10 at the 12th last year. He may still do this time round, of course, but that will have to happen tomorrow or Sunday. Today, he's tapping in for a richly deserved birdie, and is back in the lead at -4 alongside Kevin Stadler and Bill Haas. No Blixt, though, as he's just dropped a shot at 7. Sergio nearly rattles in his long birdie putt, incidentally, but must make do with his par. \"As much as I like the question, Sergio is Sergio,\" argues Simon McMahon. \"He stands alone. Although if I was pushed, I'd have to say he is the golfing equivalent of the Scotland football team.\" You might have nailed it there. The headline they put on this old tat would pretty much sum Sergio up, too. Shot of the day on 12 by Bubba Watson, who hits a gorgeous short iron to three feet. That's surely a birdie, and a share of the lead. Sergio, now back to +3 and surely just doing this to annoy now, finds the front of the green and will have a 20-footer for another birdie. It's too early to re-embrace hope with regards to Garcia, but if he rakes that in ... well, you never know. Meanwhile some news of erstwhile 1970s Capitol Records artiste Lucas Glover: the former Brian Wilson lookalike birdies 13, 17 and finally 18, and he's scribbling his name on a card that also says 69. That puts him level par for the tournament, after yesterday's 75, and in pretty good shape for the weekend. Oosthuizen's membership of the leading group at -4 is no more. He's just suffered an Augusta meltdown on 15, laying up then dumping his approach into water, and following that by three-putting. That's a triple-bogey 8. Ouch. I suppose he can console himself by arguing that he's only +1 for the two par fives there, having eagled 13. But he's not going to do that, is he. He's back to -1 for the tournament. Stenson makes a hash of 12, sending his tee shot off the back left of the green, then duffing his chip somewhat, leaving himself a 20-footer for par. That's not going to happen on a green as awkward as this. And sure enough, he drops a shot. He's back to +2. Meanwhile on 11, SERGIO RAKES IN HIS LONG BIRDIE PUTT!!! How can he make a birdie on such a difficult hole, yet miss one-foot putts, like he did yesterday (on, if memory serves, 15)? How? How and why? These two questions are, I feel, the very essence of Sergio. \"Surely Arsenal is the Sergio Garcia of English football?\" suggests Jamie Walden. \"Constantly building up your hopes, getting to a point where they can almost taste glory, and then kicking everyone who believed in them - full pelt - directly in the nads. For eight years straight. Can you tell I'm an Arsenal fan?\" Yep, it's as crystal clear as our enduring love for Sergio. Which, along with cockroaches, will be the last things standing in the event of a nuclear war. Here comes Bubba, making his way through Amen Corner. His approach to 11 is decent if not spectacular, in the meaty bulb of the green to the right of the lake. He'll have along two-putt for par. Sergio's in his group, and he's clapped his second pin high to 25 feet, a really decent and brave approach. But he's only doing this because he's dropped another shot at 9, is at +4, and feels safe in the knowledge that nothing really matters any more. Aye, Bjorn means it. He records a third birdies on the bounce, this one at 16. He's -4 for his round, on course for a 68 right now, and that puts him at -3 for the tournament. He's a shot off the four-way lead, currently held by Oosthuizen, Kevin Stadler, Blixt and Haas (who has yet to set foot on Augusta National's lush green carpet). Thomas Bjorn really means this. He's now birdied 15, and he's -2 for the tournament. Meanwhile it's still not quite happening for his fellow Scandinavian Henrik Stenson, who bombs his approach at 11 over the water and through the green, then leaves his chip back a little short of the hole. He's faced with a testing ten-footer for par, but he makes it. Nails. He's still +1, though that's only five off the lead of course. Which, given he's been distinctly average so far this week, is a pretty fine result. If he can just crank it all up a little bit, he'll not be far away. SteadyBubba is no more, slain by the beast that is Augusta National. It was never going to last. Watson drops his first shot of the 78th Masters Tournamant. A bogey-free 69 yesterday, and he nearly reached the turn without suffering today, too. But he's dropped a shot at 9, and slips out of the lead, back to -3. It takes some doing to go 27 holes before dropping one round here, mind you. Amen Corner coming up for Bubba. I wonder how it'll affect him? It's going to be fun finding out, isn't it. Thomas Bjorn isn't going away. He's just birdied 14, and once again bounces back up to -1 for this tournament. Can he stay there this time? Meanwhile Kevin Stadler birdies 5, his second of the day, and he's in a tie for the lead at -4 . \"Who is Sergio is any other sport?\" wonders Hubert O'Hearn. \"Football prodigies who flame out are an annual event, so it can't be that. But who else in whatever other sport makes us kinda sorta believe year after year, tournament after tournament that the clouds might clear and the sun god will appear? He is the Irish summer of athletes - rumoured more than witnessed. Oh, and if I had to choose an answer to my own question? The late Vitas Gerulaitis in tennis.\" That's a great question, and one I don't have any good answers for. Jimmy White in snooker? Can we have teams? If so, how about Liverpool FC in the Premier League? Somerset CCC? Wales at the Rugby World Cup? I can think of a few journalists to whom the Sergio Rule might apply, but it's probably best not to open that particular can of worms. Two solid rounds I've yet to mention today. The 2000 winner Vijay Singh has just birdied 13, and is -2 for his round and +1 overall. Behind him, Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano boasts identical figures; he's -2 today after back to back birdies at 8 and 9, and is also at +1 overall. On the same mark: Henrik Stenson, who was much fancied to do something this week, but hasn't quite got himself going yet. He's level par for his round, after birdie at 3 and bogey at 5. He's not out of this, but he'll need a good back nine to put himself into a decent position for an attack over the weekend. That should have read \"a share of the lead with Bubba, Bill Haas and Jonas Blixt\". For the in-form Swede has just picked up his second birdie of the day, this time at 3, to move to -4 himself. Meanwhile Kevin Streelman, out in the first pairing, is the current clubhouse leader. No huge claim, but there it is. He dropped a shot at 17, but signs for a one-under 71 to go with his level-par 72. He's -1 for the tournament, and in good nick for the weekend. Oosthuizen taps his eagle putt at 13 down towards the hole. It's a confident rap, and it's clearly going to drop from the second it leaves the face of his putter. Sergio should take notes. And then read the notes. That eagle takes him to -4, and a share of the lead with Bubba and Bill Haas. Oosthuizen's playing partner Kuchar is going along nicely, too, with a birdie that brings him to -1 for the tournament. Anyway, Sergio. A scrappy finish yesterday, with three bogeys in the last five holes, left him on +2 for the tournament. But he was out in the most testing conditions, and would have been hopeful of making an impact this morning. You know what's coming, don't you? He dropped a shot at 1, then another at 6. He's picked up a shot since then, at 7, and through 8 he's +3 for the tournament, but unless he does something brilliant or very stupid, and in fairness both outcomes are possible, he's probably best forgotten in this report now. What a shot by Oosthuizen on 13! He's sent his drive down the right of the par-five, and his long iron into the green arrows straight at the flag, taking a bounce by the side of the cup, then rolling six feet past. What an eagle chance he's given himself there! It's not quite up there with his albatross at 2 in 2012 - come along, be reasonable - but that's a pretty damn spectacular one nevertheless. \"Come on, now!\" Oo-er! An angry reader. It's Steve Buist! \"How can Canadian Graham DeLaet not earn 10 out of 10 on the Nilsson-o-meter? Look at the evidence! Granted, you need a beard like that to stay warm in Saskatchewan.\" In fairness, I didn't say there weren't players who went up to 11. Anyway, speaking of the man, he's just been incredibly unfortunate on the 11th. He shot 80 yesterday, and needs a minor miracle to avoid the cut. What he doesn't need is to see a wondrous 50-foot birdie rake slow down at the right-hand side of the hole, take a wee look over the precipice, then tiptoe round to the back and stay out. A hair's breadth from dropping, if you will. It really is unravelling for Leishman. Birdie-birdie-birdie to begin, and now he's handed the third of the three shots back. After bogeys at 5 and 6, he appeared to have stemmed the tide with his first par of the day at the par-three 6th, but another shot's gone at 7, and he's back to where he started the day, -2. Kuchar so unfortunate on 12. He clacks his tee shot pin high, 20 feet from the flag, and miles from the bother that's all around this hellish wee troublemaker of a hole. He then strokes a lovely birdie effort across the green, but it breaks to the right at the very last turn. He just needed one more joule of energy, and he'd be into the red figures. As it is, he remains at level par. He looks happy enough with his lot, but then he's Matt Kuchar, he always looks happy enough with his lot. Kevin Stadler continues in his quest to match the achievement of his father Craig, the 1982 winner. Stadler, who already has one 2014 tour win under his belt - no cheap shots, please - birdies the long 2nd to move to -3. He's joined there by another of yesterday's heroes, Jonas Blixt who, in the group behind, matches Stadler's feat. Just a little bit more meaningful movement at the top of the leaderboard now. Which reminds me ... -4: B Watson (7), Haas -3: Leishman (6), K Stadler (3), Blixt (2), Scott -2: Oosthuizen (11), Woodland, walker, Choi, Snedeker Bubba's been going par crazy this week so far, but his long run comes to an end at 7. That's because he's just birdied 7, to grab a share of the lead at -4. He's yet to drop a shot in this year's tournament! Oosthuizen has reached 11, meanwhile, and he's faced with a tricky 12-footer to save his par. He's dead-eyed, though and in it whistles. He remains at -2. Jose-Maria on the march! He shot 74 yesterday, birdied 5 today, and has now sashayed around Amen Corner as though it was the 1987 Ryder Cup all over again! Par at 11, par at 12, and now he eases his third to the par-five 13th to a couple of feet, and he's never missing that putt. Birdie, and he's -2 for his round, and level par for the tournament. It's not going to happen, it's obviously not going to happen, but just imagine if it was Ollie who ended Europe's 15-year drought at the Masters, given he was the last man to win it from over this way, back in 1999. Imagine what a lovely world we'd live in. \"Peter Sharples is indeed very wise,\" opines Andrew Clark, \"other than that Andy North won the US Open twice.\" Birdie for Streelman at 16, and he's sitting very comfortably now at -2 overall, closing in on the clubhouse. He'll be in fine fettle for the weekend if he's able to keep himself tucked in there. Shot of the day so far by Nick Watney, whose tee shot at 12 is clipped to a couple of feet. He taps in for his birdie, and is +2 for the tournament. And it's beginning to unravel for poor old Leishman, who has just handed back another shot to the field, with bogey at 5. He's yet to par a hole today, he's -1 for his round, and -3 for the tournament. He's back alongside the reigning champion Scott, and the previous winner Bubba, Haas out alone again at -4. Hunter Mahan (Nilsson rating: 10) birdies 2; he's only +1 overall now. Matt Kuchar's on the move, with a birdie at 10. He's -1 for the tournament, having picked up two strokes today. And having just clarified the Stephen Gallacher situation, he's gone and dropped a shot at 11, and is back to level par overall. \"I\u2019d say there\u2019s a big difference between one-major wonders who won two or three times over their careers (Andy North, Todd Hamilton) and those who were multiple career winners (Woosie, even Cink and Furyk),\" writes the very wise Peter Sharples. \"You could argue this club therefore has two categories \u2013 over\u2013achievers and under-achievers. But Watson winning the 2009 Open? Good for the game if a near-pensioner with a false hip won the showcase event?\" Yep! Yes sir! I've never been quite sure what the problem with that would be. Nobody's stopping the younger lads from going to the gym to try to steal a march, after all, which 99 times out of a hundred they do. And anyway, if I wanted to watch athletes, I'd watch athletics. It can never last around Augusta. Even your Phil Mickelsons and Greg Normans hit a wall eventually. And so Marc Leishman's hot start cools, with a dropped shot at 4. He drops back alongside Bill Haas at -4. Louis Oosthuizen is looking to rebuild his challenge, meanwhile, with a birdie at 8. He's still +1 for his round, but back to -2 overall. Meanwhile Bubba is doing what he did yesterday, and playing it nice and steady early doors. He parred 11 of the first 12 holes in his first round, and he's parred the opening five holes of his second. And where were we last with Stephen Gallacher? I'm not sure I reported his birdie at 8. If I did, apologies for wittering on, but either way, he's now level par today through 10 holes, and -1 for the tournament. Lyle managed to get up and down from that awful position at the back of 12, by the way. He remains +1 for his round today, and +5 for the tournament. \"Does G-Mac (is using that moniker now hopelessly passe? It is, isn't it?) cause significant oscillation on the Harry Nilsson-o-meter?\" wonders Nick Lewis. \"Or is that beard just a bit too neatly trimmed? Although the wee paunch (I really pay too much attention to this) is suggestive of a liking for a load of ale and a lost weekend. After a rare missed cut, natch.\" I've now got a mental image of McDowell and Rory McIlroy wandering the sidewalks of New York at carouse o'clock with feminine hygiene products sellotaped to their foreheads. Yoko will be worried about them. We have a new overall leader! Marc Leishman, who led here after the opening round last year, and finished in a tie for fourth, is hoping to go three better this time round. He's just carded his third birdie in three holes, at 3 no less, and he's -5 for the tournament. \"Your musings about Ben Curtis and Thomas Bjorn got me thinking about how one-time European major winners are thought of in the US,\" writes Matt Emerson. \"Do people like Darren Clarke and Ian Woosnam get put into the same sort of category we reserve for the likes of Ben Curtis and Stewart Cink?\" Setting aside the fact that Cink is in a special category all of his own, as the wrecker of All Humankind's Dreams, Hopes &amp; Desires, you would hope so, yes. Unfairly traducing the reputation of elite-level sports stars is half of the fun of following professional sport. Give me a bitchfest over banter any day. Also, the cathartic joy of sounding off like a foghorn apart, it's quite nice to be sometimes proved wrong, too. I've sort of (sort of) come round to Curtis over the years, on account of some decent showings in other majors. Todd Hamilton, not so much, it's legitimate to stand by that one. Some other movers and shakers: Thomas Bjorn, who started out with a pair of birdies, handed both strokes back with bogeys at 4 and 5. But he's obsessed with pairing them up today, and birdies at 7 and 8 sees him back up to -1 for the tournament. Henrik Stenson has birdied 3, and he's level par for the tournament. Glover has dropped back to +2 after bogey at 9. And Sandy Lyle visits the 12th tee for the second time, on this occasion sending a ball arcing into verdant hell back left of the green, then losing grip of his club and balancing it on his left shoulder awhile. He's been nothing if not spectacular. A hot start by Marc Leishman, and the man from down under has moved to the top of the leaderboard. Once one Australian wins this thing, everyone seems to want a piece of the action. Anyway, he's added a birdie at 2 to the one he carded at the opening hole. He's now -4, and it's probably worth putting up our first leaderboard of the round, isn't it? -4: Leishman (2), Haas -3: B Watson (3), Scott Oosthuizen, who started the day at -3, has dropped another shot, by the way. A bogey at 7 and he's -1 for the tournament, two over for his round so far. A brilliant up and down from the bunker front right of 12 by Streelman, and he remains -1. But he's in trouble at 13, laying up, then hitting his third straight past the pin and down the back of the green. That's a testing up and down for par. Which he makes. Solid stuff. Meanwhile back on the 12th tee, Sandy Lyle. Problem is, he's playing 11. His ball whistled onto the tee box just as Branden Grace, struggling away at +10, was hitting his shot. Happily, the ball doesn't hit the South African, who hits a gorgeous effort pin high, eight feet from the flag. You'll not see many better shots here today. Well done, Sandy! Matt Kuchar, who threw away the Houston Open last weekend, is at least in form, if not with a fresh winner's cheque in his pocket. He shot a one-over 73 yesterday, and has bounced back well from an opening-hole bogey, with back-to-back birdies at 6 and 7. He's level par, and will be worth keeping an eye on this weekend if he posts a score today. Top ten finishes here for Kuchar in the last two years, and he's regularly been there or thereabouts in all the majors of later. Surely his time will come soon? You sense that it's only the stuff between his lugs that's stopping him. Call it the Sergio effect. (Older readers will know this as Monty syndrome.) Larry Mize, then. The man who chases Greg Norman over broken glass in his dreams has just played 11, where he holed that ludicrous chip to snatch the 1987 tournament from under the Great White Shark's nose. He's just raked in a monster par putt, the best part of 40 feet, and remains at +1 for the tournament. He loves this hole. \"I can't look at Bubba without thinking of his Ryder Cup tee off followed by running down the fairway high fiving the crowd,\" writes Richard Simpson. \"He is Ron Burgundy.\" Yes, he's great, isn't he. You have to love Bubba. Though in that context, he's very much a poor man's Boo Weekley, who spent the majority of the 2008 Ryder Cup riding his driver like a horse. Lucas Glover, who won the 2009 US Open, the one everyone wanted David Duval to win, appears to be in the mood today. He opened with a birdie, and though he dropped one at 4, has just picked up shots at 7 and 8 to move to +1 overall, after his opening round of 75. He's clean shaven again, which is something of a shame as I appreciated his look of 2011, which registered 7 on the Harry Nilsson-o-meter (for the record, only Hunter Mahan from the world of golf has ever given a reading of 10). Anyway, this is possibly not what you're here for. Marc Leishman has picked up where he left off yesterday: a closing birdie at 18, and now an opening birdie this morning. He's -3 for the tournament and tied for second alongside his compatriot Adam Scott and Bubba. Bubba's out, and he's parred the first. High hopes for Bubba today, he's wonderful to watch. His drive at 13 yesterday was hilarious, taking out the dogleg by simply booming over the trees. Stephen Gallacher's down-and-up-and-down second-round continues apace: after picking up that shot at 6, he's just handed the damn thing straight back at 7, and is back to level par. Up on 11, Points registers an easy par. Streelman manages it too, though he larrups his first putt a good 12 feet past the hole, and is required to roll in a (rather brilliant and calm) left-to-right slider to remain at -1. He looks pretty pleased with himself as he trots off the green, disaster having been avoided. Which, around Amen Corner, is all you can ever really hope for. Anything else is the biggest of bonuses. The first group out has arrived at Amen Corner. DA Points is labouring at +7, but from the top of the hill he's just creamed his iron straight into the heart of the green. So many players yesterday, worried about dumping their ball in the water front left of the green, pushed their approach wide right into the Larry Mize Valley, and while the local boy won the 1987 Masters by chipping in from there, it ain't so easy getting up and down normally. I'd guess, a rough estimate of course, that 100 percent of those following Points would take a facsimile copy of his shot here. It's pin high, 25 feet from the flag. A birdie unlikely, but then so's a bogey. His playing partner Kevin Streelman, at -1 and with perhaps more to lose, plays the shot more conservatively, only just finding the green on the far right, well away from the drink. A long two-putt for par. So much for the theory that Augusta will be offering up opportunities this morning. Oosthuizen has dropped back to -2 after shedding a stroke at 4. None of the other players who carded sub-par rounds yesterday are out yet, save the aforementioned Gallacher - who has just birdied 6 to move back to -1, level par for his round today - but the early trends suggest it might be equally tough going all round today. No early birdie blitzes, though former champions Larry Mize and Jose-Maria Olazabal are both -1 for their rounds today and +1 overall. Bjorn slips back to level par for the tournament with a bogey at 4. Another European slipping out of the red figures: Francesco Molinari, who has opened with a bogey. And Kevin Streelman's outward stretch has ended on a sour note, with a bogey at 9. He's back to -1 for his round, and -1 for the tournament. A slightly stodgy start from Scotland's Stephen Gallacher, who has followed up three pars with a bogey at 4. He's back to level par for the tournament. I wonder if he's still thinking about that preposterous, Sergioesque miss on 15 yesterday, a short uphill gimme that'd have earned him an eagle and a nice crystal bowl from the good folk of Augusta National? A birdie was scant reward for one of the shots of the week so far, a wood sent sailing serenely over the water and straight into the heart of the green, to a couple of feet. A real shame, as it was the perfect response to a mini-collapse after the turn yesterday, dropping shots at 10, 11 and 12. Damn it! Scotland's 15-year wait for a major champion goes on! Grace's compatriot Louis Oosthuizen is the only one of yesterday's success stories out on the course right now. The 2010 Open champion shot a brilliant 69 yesterday, a score worthy of plaudits not least because he dumped a pathetic tee shot into Rae's Creek at 12, and yet didn't lose the head thereafter, limiting the damage to a bogey and playing the rest of the course in -1. He's still at 3- having played the first two holes today in par. Oosthuizen looks calm, focused and relaxed this week - in that respect, he's the bizarro Sergio - which I guess is what you'd expect from a player who came so close to victory here in 2012, making a play-off he'd lose to Bubba Watson. But then his record here otherwise is appalling! Other than 2012, he's missed every cut, four out of five! Dear me. The conclusion, then, on all available evidence: he blows very hot and very cold round here. So if he posts another decent score today, the rest of the field should be very concerned. Branden Grace suffered yesterday's super shocker, his 12-over round of 84 sending him crashing to the bottom of the pile. He's started well today, though, four straight pars followed by a birdie at 5. That takes him off the bottom of the leaderboard. He's now, eh, joint bottom at +11, with the 62-year old Ben Crenshaw, who has two Green Jackets in his locker that'll keep him warm once this bad week is over, and Michael McCoy, a 51-year-old amateur. It's not really happened yet for the promising Grace, who had a top-20 finish here last year but hasn't got going yet in 2014. He's only 25, there's plenty of time. But he'll be afforded none of that special stuff this weekend. Another birdie for Bjorn! He's obviously had more than enough of watching your Olesens, Blixts and Stensons leading the Scandinavian charge, and has decided to give it a whirl himself. He really should have been the first player from Scandinavia to win a major, of course, but his head started spinning through various different axes all at once in a Sandwich bunker, and he let Ben Curtis win the 2003 Open. A dismal era for the Open, that, though while Bjorn would have been a much more distinguished name on the grand old championship's roll of honour than Curtis, at least the Dane doesn't have as much blood on his hands as Ernie Els and Phil Mickelson, both of whom let the painfully average Todd Hamilton nick off with the 2004 version. What a business. Anyway, I digress. Bjorn's picked up his shot on 2, a birdie-birdie start. He's -1 overall, and currently one of only 21 players under par for the tournament. Another European veteran with a pretty dismal record at the Masters is Thomas Bjorn. The Dane has usually fared better at the PGA, where he's got second- and third-placed finishes to his name. But he's been steady at Augusta over the last couple of years - experience is never a bad thing round here, after all - and he's in reasonable nick here. Yesterday's opening-round 73 would have looked a whole lot better hand he not dropped shots late on at 14 and 17, and he's opened with a birdie today. He's level par for the tournament. Darren Clarke has an awful record at Augusta, one top ten finish in 1998 apart, and he was never really involved in the thick of that tournament. He looked to have been doing his usual thing of bugger all yesterday, +4 through 12, but picked up on the road home, with birdies at 13 and 15. He ended the day with a two-over 74, much better than it could have been, and he's started well this morning, a birdie at 2 hauling him up to +1 for the tournament. The oldest winner of the Masters was Jack Nicklaus, who was 46 when he emerged victorious from that astonishing 1986 staging. Clarke is 45. Clock's ticking, Darren, it might be now or never! And there's been an early move from Kevin Streelman, who is playing in this morning's opening pairing with DA Points. Streelman isn't in hot form - he missed the cut in Houston last week. He hasn't got much of a major-championship history - the best he can manage was a tie for 12th place at the PGA just gone. And he's only ever missed the cut at Augusta on his previous two visits. But maybe this week is third time lucky, with a little bit of karma thrown in, as earlier this week he gave away a couple of tickets for the Masters to a random teenager on Twitter. But he shot a level-par 72 yesterday, and he's opened his round today with birdies at 2 and 4. He's -2 for his round through 6, and -2 for the tournament. An early sign, perhaps, that much as expected, there may be scores on offer this morning, before the greens get hilariously borderline-unplayable, as they're often wont to do during the hot afternoon sun. Here we go, then. A fairly nondescript opening round of the 78th Masters Tournament, if we're being totally honest with ourselves. Only four rounds under 70, with no 65, 66 or 67 style statements being made, no early gauntlets thrown down. Only 19 men sub par, as well. It's more of a chin-stroker than a throbbing-temple-massager, at this stage anyway. The pin placements were hellish for a Thursday, and similar posers are likely to be set today in the name of fairness. The greens are as fast and as tricky as they've ever been, and are only set to get more troublesome under the Georgia sun; as yesterday, the earlier starters should have it a little easier, in terms of both wind and the performance of the baked, rock-hard dancefloors.
