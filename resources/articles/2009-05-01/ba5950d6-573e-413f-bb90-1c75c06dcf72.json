Yesterday his agent Ricky Simms was 99% sure that he would fulfil his commitment to race over 150m in the (happily traffic-free) city centre. In athletic terms the event can have little significance except as a spectacle \u2013 the Jamaican continues where he left off in Beijing by bringing street cred to athletics. Even the car crash a few weeks ago which put his appearance in doubt had an element of laid-back cool: you crash a BMW M3 and only sustain injury by stepping on thorns while gracefully exiting the wreckage. Bolt's decision to accept the invitation for such a showpiece event probably underlines what we already know about him. A non-conformist, he has no qualms about an outing in a far from normal setting and a far from normal surface. A carefully constructed 150m straightway down the centre of Deansgate may not be every Olympic champion's ideal preparation for the outdoor season but in Bolt's case it appeals to the showman within him. The organisers first used the idea of combining street sprint races with the mass running event at last year's Great North Run. This year it will be extended into two or three other track and field events in a competition against the Aussies. It's not exactly Twenty20 cricket but as the sport tries to widen its appeal anything is worth a try. It will be interesting to see how many of the 20,000 runners who complete the earlier 10km stay on to watch Bolt stretch his legs over 150m. It's a rarely contested event which has no official record status even on a conventional track, although there have been one or two other notable staged races. The most notorious was a disastrous matchup between Donovan Bailey and Michael Johnson in Toronto in 1997, billed as the race to decide the world's fastest man. In Atlanta a year earlier both had won Olympic titles in new world records, Bailey at 100m and Johnson over 200m. I was despatched to the Sky Dome to cover the ludicrous event. A two-lane track of 75m curve and 75m straight was laid out which apparently favoured Johnson. First prize was \u00a3900,000 and second, or last if you like, was \u00a3300,000 and after seven or eight seconds it was all over as Johnson grabbed his quadriceps and pulled up lame. I tried to tell my producer that Johnson wasn't too keen on a post-race interview but then again there wasn't anyone else once we had done Bailey. It was a farce which did no one but the Canadian's bank balance any good; his time of 15sec was irrelevant. The quickest legal run over the distance was by Italy's Olympic 200m champion Pietro Mennea in 1983 in 14.8sec. It is likely that Bolt ran 150m quicker than that during his 200m world record in Beijing and likewise Johnson in 1996. Bolt was timed over every 10m segment in the 100m but this is impractical around the bend in the 200m although if you average his time then he would at least run 14.475sec. All of this is interesting but irrelevant. When Bolt returns in July to compete in the London Grand Prix the stopwatch will more keenly eyed, but for now it's the showman who will take centre stage. Such is his draw that the IAAF's president, Lamine Diack, is planning to attend, ostensibly to see Bolt but no doubt to also check on the popularity of the street sprint. Sometimes to move forward, it's worth looking back. Athletics in the days before standardised tracks was done among fetes and festivals. Sprinting in straight lines was the norm and the \"Lightning Bolt\" may be interested to know that in 1845 George Eastham broke the 220-yard record at Belle Vue in Manchester and reputedly clocked 21.5 down Blackburn Road. He was known as The Flying Clogger. So this whole idea may not be new, but at least the nicknames appear to have improved."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
