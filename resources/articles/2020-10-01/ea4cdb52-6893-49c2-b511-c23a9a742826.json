Let me perform this service to you before discussion of Channel 4\u2019s new four-part drama Adult Material begins. Unlike the scene itself, we\u2019ll ease into it. Let\u2019s start at the beginning. Hayley Burrows (Hayley Squires) is a 33-year-old hardworking, devoted mother-of-three. Her hard work is as a porn star, Jolene Dollar. She is successful, respected and clear-sighted about exactly what she can get out of the industry \u2013 and what it can take. She keeps a weather eye out for the younger girls, including a 19-year-old first-timer Amy (Siena Kelly) who arrives on set starry-eyed (\u201cMy boyfriend worships you!\u201d) and bouncing \u2013 soon literally, atop the organ around which the industry is built \u2013 with enthusiasm. \u201cI love sex!\u201d she tells Hayley/Jolene before they begin. \u201cWell,\u201d says Hayley, after a pause. \u201cThat\u2019s a good place to start.\u201d When a replacement girl is needed for an anal scene the director, Dave (Phil Daniels, at his slightly sweaty, squirrelly best), offers Amy the gig. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to hold it against you if you don\u2019t,\u201d he says, maybe even meaning it. It\u2019s one of the many light touches throughout showing that power relations are always in play. Hayley takes her outside and with rough kindness tells her what she actually needs to know: get as much money as you can for your first time, and be aware \u201cthat once it\u2019s on the menu \u2013 it\u2019s not coming off.\u201d Hayley checks with Dave to find out who the scene is with. \u201cHairy Simon? Oh, he\u2019s nice. Not too big. It\u2019ll be like doing it with your boyfriend.\u201d Amy, it turns out, doesn\u2019t do it with her boyfriend and decides against the scene. \u201cDon\u2019t talk her into it,\u201d Hayley warns Dave as she leaves for school pickup. \u201c\u2019Course not.\u201d He does, of course. With the aforementioned result, which is so common there is an industry term for it after which the first episode is named \u2013 Rosebud. The rest of the series traces the domino effect of this first violation \u2013 whether you call it that of Hayley\u2019s trust or Amy\u2019s body. Adult Material, created and written by Lucy Kirkwood, lays down a confident track through a dramatic subject that is thick with well-worn tropes and established points of view (from the idea that participants are victims or perpetrators to denial that there can be any such dynamic in this simple world of shame-free shagging) and yet avoids them all. Her porn world is neither unbearably seedy nor unutterably glamorous. Hayley is neither desperately vulnerable nor completely free in her choices. She and her colleagues have camaraderie, and she\u2019s not surrounded by creeps, but there are dangerous men on her radar. Kirkwood\u2019s world is a fully realised one, recognisable to us all (if slightly more semen-spattered than we\u2019re used to). That it often plays at length like a workplace comedy \u2013 the bored rattling off of health and safety questions and answers after the shoot (\u201cDid you feel like you were raped during this shoot?\u201d \u201cNo\u201d) \u2013 means your defences are down when the moments come that confront the business they\u2019re in. At one point, Hayley refuses to go to a party for a US porn kingpin, Tom Pain (Julian Ovenden), who caters to those with underage tastes. Dave tries to minimise his transgressions. \u201cThey look about 11,\u201d she replies. \u201cThey\u2019re meant to be 11. Some of them say: \u2018I am 11.\u2019\u201d Adult Material is a study in how we compromise, protect ourselves, the effect of childhood experiences big and small on where we end up and of how much responsibility we bear to each other. And it holds all these light and dark elements in perfect balance. The performances are uniformly great, though Alex Jarrett as Hayley\u2019s oldest child, Phoebe, deserves a special mention. In a few short, exquisitely written, scenes she covers immense and heartbreaking ground without even a fractional misstep. Much the same can be said of Adult Material in its entirety. It won\u2019t satisfy moralistic blood-and-thunderers, because it insists on the complexity of the industry and its makers. But, by the same token, if the blood-and-thunderers would like some comfort, it will engage instead of alienate its users and maybe confront them with a little more truth than they would normally \u2013 forgive me \u2013 swallow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
