Not sure how much of a psychological edge was earned by either guy during a relatively peaceful affair that seemed more about network-boasting. In 52 days\u2019 time, it will be about so much more. Check back later for a full report from today\u2019s kickoff. Justin Bieber joins Mayweather on stage Ticket prices Ellerbe says tickets for the fight will range from $1,500 to $7,500 \u2013 bear in mind that\u2019s face value \u2013 and an announcement for an on-sale date will come in the next few days. Ellerbe acknowledges Floyd Mayweather Sr, who will train his son for the fight, but who is declining to speak at the podium. And then an emphatic introduction: pound for pound, the greatest fighter on this planet: Floyd \u2018Money\u2019 Mayweather! \u201cIt\u2019s all about the best fighting the best. And Pacquiao is one of the best fighters of this era. Everything is about timing. I think we couldn\u2019t choose a better time. Our game plan is just to be smart and take it one fight at a time, like all 47 [previous] fights. This is a fight that the world can\u2019t miss. This is an unbelievable matchup. Action-packed fight. I\u2019m in the gym working right now, dedicating myself to the sport. Pushing myself to the limit because I\u2019ve never wanted to win a fight so bad in my life. And I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s going to push himself to the limit, because wants to win the same way. \u201cOne thing I do know about any sport. When you lose, it\u2019s in your mind. If you lost once, it\u2019s in your mind. If you lost twice, it\u2019s in your mind. From day one, I was always taught to be a winner, no matter what. Be a winner. Push yourself to the limit. Stay focused and be the best that you can be. Stephen Espinoza, I want to thank you. Richard Sturm, I want to thank you. Bob Arum, Team Pacquiao. Because without everyone together, we couldn\u2019t make this fight happen. So I have to be thankful for us coming together as one, so we can give the world what thay want to see: \u201cMayweather-Pacquiao, the biggest fight in boxing history.\u201d After a long-winded introduction that touches on the ancient roots of the Filipino people, Bob Arum finally brings Manny Pacquiao to the microphone. \u201cI believe this is what you have been waiting for since five years ago,\u201d Pacquiao says. \u201cThe fight is on and you\u2019re very excited. Both of us, we are going to undergo hard training for this fight. We will do our best and on May 2nd to make you happy. \u201cThe most important thing ... is the name of the Lord. The name of the Lord will be glorified. I want to let the people know that there is a God who can raise people from nothing into something. And that\u2019s me. I came from nothing into something.\u201d Roach: \u201cWe\u2019re going to kick his ass\u201d Freddie Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s longtime trainer, keeps it short and sweet. \u201cI\u2019d really like to thank everyone who made this fight happen,\u201d the six-time Trainer of the Year says. \u201cI love challenges. This is the biggest challenge of my life. It\u2019s finally here, it\u2019s finally in front of me. I\u2019ve been looking forward to it for a long time. \u201cWe are in the toughest fight of our life. We\u2019re fighting the best fighter in the world. And we\u2019re going to kick his ass. I\u2019m sorry. Good luck, Floyd.\u201d Showtime\u2019s Espinoza to the podium \u201cWe\u2019re not at all surprised this fight was made,\u201d Showtime\u2019s Stephen Espinoza says. \u201cWhenever it was time to discuss a Mayweather opponent, Manny Pacquiao was always high on that list.\u201d He says CBS Corporation, Showtime\u2019s parent company, will use all possible assets to promote the fight. Metta World Peace is present and accounted for Arum next Lots of self-congratulations from Pacquiao promoter Bob Arum (who can\u2019t resist taking a shot at Floyd Mayweather Sr near the end). \u201cIt\u2019s great to be part of an event that so elevates the sport of boxing,\u201d the 83-year-old promoter said. \u201cWhen we compare it to other events, other major events like the Super Bowl, even the Olympics \u2013 we get worldwide attention to those events and it\u2019s been rare that that worldwide attention focuses on a boxing match. And believe me, with the help of everyone, the entire world will be watching May 2nd in the US, May 3rd in Asia. They\u2019ll all be watching this great event unfold. And it\u2019s a credit to the sport of boxing that we\u2019ve been able to put on such an event.\u201d Arum even shook Mayweather Jr\u2019s hand. The undercard MGM Resorts International president Richard Sturm with boilerplate remarks about just how amazing the fight will be. Good to know. Mayweather and Pacquiao meet at the center of the stage, several feet apart, and stare each other down. They then turn to the audience for a photo opportunity. Even Fox Business is in on the fun. And now Mayweather advisor Leonard Ellerbe has taken the dais. Mayweather enters second Jimmy Lennon Jr announces the entrance of Mayweather. That\u2019s not arbitrary. Floyd will enter and be introduced last on fight night \u2013 a specific point of negotiation. Here\u2019s Pacquiao The lights fall and AC/DC\u2019s Thunderstruck plays over the PA. We know what that means. Manny Pacquiao emerges to what\u2019s become a signature anthem as Michael Buffer sings his praises. The waiting game It wouldn\u2019t be a boxing press conference if it started on time. In the meantime, here\u2019s Mayweather arguing with a woman who had never heard of him last October in south London. Floyd\u2019s toughest opponent in years. The other champ is here Pacquiao arrives with trainer Freddie Roach, promoter Bob Arum and a friend. Who will speak Today\u2019s speakers \u2013 in predicted order \u2013 should include: Richard Sturm, MGM Resorts International president Ken Hershman, HBO Sports president Stephen Espinoza, Showtime Sports executive vice president and general manager Bob Arum, Top Rank Promotions founder and CEO Leonard Ellerbe, Mayweather Promotions CEO Freddie Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s trainer Manny Pacquiao, WBO welterweight champion Floyd Mayweather Jr, WBC and WBA welterweight champion Not much longer now, we think. So close yet so far For two global superstars whose names have been inextricably bound for most of the past decade, Mayweather and Pacquiao haven\u2019t spent much time together over the years. Not until their chance meeting at a Miami Heat game in January did a photograph of the two fighters together exist. But that\u2019s not to say their long and winding paths to May\u2019s showdown haven\u2019t intersected through the years. They were promotional stablemates at Top Rank until Mayweather\u2019s acrimonous divorce from the company in 2006. They even fought on the same card on 10 November 2001 at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. And then there was Pacquiao\u2019s famous stoppage of Erik Morales in January 2006. Eagle-eyed viewers can spot Mayweather in the center of the second row next to longtime adviser Leonard Ellerbe (more clearly visible in the white suit). Mayweather is highly animated throughout the fight, rising to his feet multiple times when Pacquiao turns up the pressure on his Mexican rival. When the Filipino slugger closes the show with a 10th-round TKO \u2013 at the 5:09 mark above \u2013 watch closely as Mayweather stands on his chair and raises both arms aloft in celebration. One can only wonder how much money Mayweather had riding on his future archrival that night. The champ is here Mayweather walks the red carpet ahead of today\u2019s presser. Pacquiao on First Take today Earlier today Pacquiao spent 12 minutes getting screamed at by Stephen A Smith during an appearance on First Take, ESPN\u2019s two-hour weekday morning debate program. The Filipino congressman spent the entire segment parrying a series of leading questions and scorching hot takes \u2013 from Mayweather devotee Smith and weapons-grade Floyd hater Skip Bayless \u2013 as the roundtable descended into a cynical spiral of manufactured bluster. Edward R Murrow on See It Now it was not. At one point Pacquiao, in a relatively rare moment of candor, remarked he was more worried about his fights with Oscar De La Hoya and Miguel Cotto than Mayweather. That insight seemed worthy closer inspection. Instead, Smith used it as a launchpad into a rant against the \u201cwashed up\u201d De La Hoya\u2019s age. (Never mind that Oscar was 35 when he fought Pacquiao, three years younger than Floyd.) Preamble Fifty-two days. That\u2019s all that stands between today and the long-awaited showdown between Floyd Mayweather Jr and Manny Pacquiao. The countdown to what\u2019s certain to be the richest fight in history formally begins today at a red-carpet, accreditation-only press conference taking place at Nokia Theatre LA Live, a 7,100-seat music and theater venue in downtown Los Angeles. The fighters made their arrivals at 2pm local time and have spent most of the past two hours conducting breakaway interviews with the media. The official press conference is scheduled to begin roughly 40 minutes. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime why not read Kevin Mitchell\u2019s piece on whether the Mayweather-Pacquiao super-fight can save boxing: In the best tradition of having a bit each way, Al Haymon has his real earning beast on pay-per-view, of course. And Floyd Mayweather\u2019s teasing build-up to his eventual \u2013 some (retrospectively, at least) would say inevitable \u2013 showdown with Manny Pacquiao has been a masterclass in media manipulation. At the time of writing, it seems the only time they will share a media podium before the real hullabaloo of \u201cfight week\u201d will be in Los Angeles on Wednesday, an accreditation-only affair that might be interesting or could retread too many familiar themes to be worth even a cursory glance. Anything with Mayweather\u2019s name on it, however, generates plenty of ink; ditto Pacquiao. It is probably why the promoters are not bothering with a media tour, as such. There is little need. The fight sells itself. And will the actual boxing match the millions and millions of words that precede it? You would hope so, or the fight billed as the greatest in the history of boxing might be remembered as a limp comma in a very long sentence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
