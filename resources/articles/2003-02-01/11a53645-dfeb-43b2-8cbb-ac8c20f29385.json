Amsterdam", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2003/feb/09/observercashsection.theobserver9", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2003/feb/09/observercashsection.theobserver9", "fields": {"headline": "Get on your bike and go Dutch", "bodyText": "It is well known for its coffee shops, red light district and Van Goghs but Amsterdam is also popular with Brits buying homes abroad. The city combines all the the cultural attractions of any major conurbation with the charms of small-town manageability and attractive scenery. Its flat terrain - easily tackled on one of the ubiquitous bicycles - and tree-lined canals provide a haven from the hustle and bustle of the nightlife just around the corner. Property can be a bit pricey, especially West of the city in the district of Jordaan, originally the workers' quarter, but good transport connections offer an easy commute for those wishing to buy outside the centre. Who? Van Gogh is the city's most famous former resident. Its best-known house is that of Anne Frank, a stark reminder of how the city suffered under Nazi oppression. For football fans, it is the place to spot some of the sport's biggest names, including Johan Cruyff, who captained Ajax to three successive European Cup victories and led Holland to the World Cup final in 1974. How? There are no restrictions on foreigners owning homes in the Netherlands so buying shouldn't be too much of a struggle. If you don't know where to start looking, the first step could be to pay for help from an estate agent, preferably one who is a member of the Dutch Association of Real Estate Brokers. Alternatively, try the website Housing Online. Once you find a property you'll need to hire a notary - or property lawyer - who will draw up contracts for both buyer and seller. Paying a deposit of 10 per cent is mandatory. Estate agents' fees are typically between 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent of the purchase price, while notary fees will be around 1.5 per cent plus VAT. How much? Amsterdam is not the cheapest place in the Netherlands, but the further you stray from the centre the cheaper the prices. The transport system is excellent so it might be worth the commute.The Amsterdam housing market experienced a boom last year, but this has cooled off recently. You can get a newly-refurbished one-bedroom apartment with a balcony and wooden floors in the centre for \u00a3209,000 (www.apartmentservices.nl). A 1912 four-bedroom apartment a mile from the city centre with views of a park is for sale at \u00a3479,786 (www.viviun.com). Additional costs for homebuyers include a legal transfer cost of 6 per cent of the property as well as land registry expenses and a mortgage initiation fee. Why? Travel connections with the UK are excellent and dirt cheap. Low cost airlines EasyJet, Buzz and BMI all have a number of flights between London and Amsterdam from as little as \u00a312.50 one way. While the temperature can be bitter in winter, the frozen canals provide a beautiful spectacle and an opportunity to don ice skates and join in the fun. Why not? Residents have to put up with throngs of tourists. The worst are the stag parties, mainly interested in the red light district and the relaxed drugs laws. From mid-October to mid-March the climate is pretty miserable, and it's no haven for drivers: the bike rules."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
