The Premier League champions can move eight points clear of Pep Guardiola\u2019s team with victory at the Etihad Stadium, albeit having played one game more, after responding to the loss of Virgil van Dijk with five straight wins in all competitions. City have yet to record back-to-back wins in the Premier League this season but Klopp, while dismissive of the suggestion Sunday\u2019s game could have an impact on the title race, insists their threat and quality is undiminished. \u201cIt is important that we have our own plan and not only think about their plan, that we are brave, we play football with all we have and then we have a chance,\u201d said the Liverpool manager. \u201cBut it is very difficult. This is the most difficult game in the world of football I would say, to play against Manchester City. \u201cIt is a very difficult game hopefully for both teams because both teams will perform on a high level. There are so many things that are different this season, nothing is to compare with last Nothing can compare with the year before. year. Everything is different and we just have to make sure we get through very intense periods, line up the fittest players, and play the best football we can.\u201d The rivalry between Liverpool and City has dominated the Premier League over the past two seasons and served up several memorable, high-calibre contests. Klopp believes his team must reproduce the clinical form that destroyed Atalanta 5-0 on Tuesday in the Champions League to record a first Premier League win at the Etihad since November 2015. He added: \u201cIn England, with all the quality of the other teams and all the challenges in the game \u2013 what you have to be aware of and think about and what you have to do \u2013 it is City [who are most difficult to play] because they have a good plan, a clear plan and in each position a player who has the physicality and the technique to make a difference. \u201cThey play a specific way, they are pretty dominant, but if they have to counterattack they are pretty strong so they have speed and creativity. They are in really good shape. If you don\u2019t use all your chances that can cause you a problem results-wise. We just have to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen on Sunday and they will not have that many (chances).\u201d Klopp, meanwhile, has congratulated Mamadou Sakho on winning his libel action against the World Anti-Doping Agency after it repeated false claims that the former Liverpool defender had taken a banned substance in March 2016. Sakho missed the 2016 Europa League final after receiving a provisional ban from Uefa, later overturned on appeal, and never played for Liverpool again. The Liverpool manager commented: \u201cWe all knew for a long time already that Mama did nothing wrong. It was a massive, massive blow. Not only couldn\u2019t he play the Europa League final but he couldn\u2019t play in the Euros as well. I\u2019m really happy for Mama that he at least now got the evidence that he did nothing wrong and it\u2019s a very important thing. \u201cDoping is a problem yes, but I never really saw it as a problem in football because I\u2019m 30 years in it and never was in contact with any kind of it. And if [there is], it\u2019s because somebody made a silly decision not because they wanted to improve his recovery time or whatever. If you carry around the mark that you did doping, especially when you didn\u2019t do it, that\u2019s massive. So I\u2019m really happy he\u2019s freed of all of these things.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
