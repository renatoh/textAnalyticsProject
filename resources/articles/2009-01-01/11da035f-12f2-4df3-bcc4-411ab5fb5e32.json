The story, which is unconfirmed, quotes unnamed \"people who are monitoring his illness\"; in a phone call, Jobs apparently told the organisation \"Why don't you guys leave me alone - why is this important?\" Why is it important? Well, Apple's stock has lost around 10% of its value since Jobs released a letter on Wednesday saying he would be on medical leave until June because his medical condition - previous described as a \"hormone imbalance\" - were \"more complex\". Clearly, some stockholders think it is important. Bloomberg quotes medical sources who say that neuroendocrine tumors that originate in the pancreas, as Jobs's did, often spread to the liver. One option doctors have in these cases is to perform a liver transplant, Steven Brower, professor and chairman of surgery at Mercer University School of Medicine in Savannah, Georgia, said. \"It's one of the tumors for which transplantation can be considered,\" said Brower, who is a member of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. \"It's rare, but it's sometimes done.\" Note that Brower isn't treating Jobs, and there's no suggestion that he's the source of Bloomberg's story. However, he is a specialist in this field. There's nothing in what Browser has said that differs from the many medical opinions out there. And Brower does offer a positive outlook, if - pinch of salt time - Jobs is indeed seeking such a transplant. Brower said the transplant might work out well in a patient whose neuroendocrine cancer began in the pancreas, in part because this tumor type often spreads only to the liver and grows so slowly. Even after having had a Whipple procedure [as Jobs did to remove the tumours], a patient might expect to have good quality of life, he said. \"The outcome can be quite good,\" he said. \"With immunosuppressive drugs, the patient can expect to have a significant, durable life expectancy.\" The Whipple procedure, following neuroendocrine tumours, has a survival rate of around 50% after 5 years. That puts Jobs in the fortunate 50% already. Plus he no doubt has the best medical treatment money can buy. Why does it matter? Why do the stories (and we've spared you one of the more ludicrous medical ones that was on Wikileaks - which even Wikileaks didn't believe, since the timings, quite apart from anything else, were all wrong, involving a blood test apparently done in 2004 by a company that didn't exist until 2006) keep trickling out? Because Steve Jobs can't stop trying to control everything. He won't accept that it's not that people want him to be ill. Quite the opposite. They just want to know. Then they can arrange their lives. Everyone will be - well, if not happier, at least with a little less uncertainty in their lives. To recall the line from the John Cleese showcase film Clockwise, in which Cleese is a time-obsessed headmaster who is trying to get to an appointment but keeps being diverted, \"I can cope with the despair. It's the hope that kills you.\" (Cleese wrote the line himself.) The irony is that in his 2005 commencement speech at Stanford, Jobs said: Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything \u2014 all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. By \"soon\" he meant \"in less than 100 years\". We're all going to die, one day. There's no embarrassment in being ill; only in needlessly hiding from the truth. So we will, regrettably, have to keep trying to follow the zigs and zags of this story until the facts emerge, blinking, into the light."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
