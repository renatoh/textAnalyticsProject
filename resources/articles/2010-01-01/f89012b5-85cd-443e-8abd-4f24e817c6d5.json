But Lagr\u00e8ne can play any style of jazz guitar from the last 80 years: lead and rhythm, electric and acoustic. The music of Django Reinhardt, whose 100th anniversary is being celebrated by Lagr\u00e8ne's tour (and a festival at the Le QuecumBar in Battersea) is only part of the story. When his band, a trio with bass and saxophone, launches into a version of Just the Way You Are, there's no pretence of \"authenticity\". They use their arrangement of Billy Joel's supper-club staple as a launching point for elegant improvisation. Saxophonist Franck Wolf is effortlessly melodic in the Paul Desmond manner, with a soprano sound that's somewhere north of Sidney Bechet and south of John Coltrane. Lagr\u00e8ne pays tribute to his \"manouche\" heritage and the genius of Django with Minor Swing, but the trio's improvisations soon morph into bebop and beyond. After the band return to the sparky theme, Lagr\u00e8ne can't resist adding a few dazzling flourishes \u2013 rapid runs and tiny, percussive explosions from his fretboard. The repertoire includes standards such as All of Me and Autumn Leaves, Tom Jobim's sublime Wave, Stevie Wonder's Isn't She Lovely and bop classics Ornithology and Donna Lee (which Lagr\u00e8ne once recorded with the fusion bass legend Jaco Pastorius). This kind of jazz is a kingdom of Lagr\u00e8ne's making, with idiosyncratic rules, evident in the way he stitches mainstream swing to post-bop harmonies while throwing in \"chicken\" funk or Sunny's kitsch 1960s pop. Lagr\u00e8ne has gone way beyond the precocious virtuosity he displayed as a teenager three decades ago. Hearing him is like watching an expert juggler throw more china in the air, not worrying about the occasional drop, while the audience gasps and grins with pleasure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
