BREAKING NEWS: Just as the Backbencher was going to (virtual) press, it emerged that the Quiet Man is about to make his TV-presenting debut on BBC3 in the company of Johnny Vaughan. More details shortly. FROM WESTMINSTER The Backbencher asked Guardian political editor Michael White what he made of Tony Blair's efforts to clarify the issue of EU migrants. \"Two notable themes emerged from today's question time: the question of illegal or semi-legal workers in the UK, which came up in relation to the Morecambe Bay disaster, and the related fact that on May 1 anybody living in the 10 EU accession states will be allowed to come and work in Britain. \"Most EU states have imposed a transition period. They are not quite sure what to expect from eastern Europe. A couple of years ago - and it attracted very little media and political attention at the time - Britain announced that new EU citizens would have free and complete access to this country. The idea was that we recognised the importance of having a steady supply of immigrants - we don't seem to be breeding enough ourselves to replace our numbers - and that by letting people in early we might, as it were, get the good ones. That's the theory of it, but as the day approaches there has been some anxiety. \"Michael Howard raised it in his first batch of questions and said the PM had contradicted himself last week. In fact, he said that after question time last week Mr Blair had been contradicted by the No 10 spokesman, then by the home secretary, and then again by the No 10 spokesman. He said it was typical of Blair to make a bold statement on Wednesday for the headlines, then climb down on Thursday, reverse on Friday and create total confusion by the weekend. \"This was a little unkind, I thought. Mr Blair repeatedly said it was important to distinguish between the free movement of people - we can all move around the EU - and the free movement of workers. He said the government was checking that the free movement of workers, which it has conceded, doesn't lead to abuse, particularly of the benefits system. Now quite what that means wasn't too clear to Mr Howard - and frankly it isn't clear to me, either - but Mr Blair is anxious not to have the Daily Mail and his other tormentors saying that 20 million Poles are going to come over here on May 1. The Express has been trying to whip this issue up for several weeks, but without great success - nobody else is taking it up apart from specialist interest groups and Migration Watch, the anti-immigration lobby who are very articulate and effective. \"Of course, this tied in with the Morecambe Bay affair. Mr Blair, in his usual vague, well-meaning way, said we must certainly crack down on this where we can, but everyone knows it's difficult. Michael Jack, a Lancashire Tory, said it was a tragic and unpardonable incident and we really had to tackle the gangmasters who exploit illegal workers. Then Mr Blair made perhaps the most interesting and specific point of the day when he said that if we had ID cards we could control this sort of thing better. \"Charles Kennedy raised the question of Guantanamo Bay prisoners. Was there a deadline for a decision on the trail of the handful of British detainees? And he asked what David Blunkett meant when he talked about a lower burden of proof for terrorism - wasn't this a threat to civil liberties? Surprise, surprise, Mr Blair said no such thing was true. There isn't a deadline to resolve the Guantanamo issue, but it has to be resolved. Then he did something he often does, saying: 'You talk about civil liberties but there is a real danger of terrorism in this country.' And that's true, far more so than we're ever told.\" &gt;&gt;&gt; PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS Migrant workers, ro-ro freight trains, trade union handouts and a hasty exit: Matthew Tempest on this week's PMQs. Migrant workers, ro-ro freight trains, trade union handouts and a hasty exit: Matthew Tempest on this week's PMQs. COMPETITION RESULT Due to a copying-and-pasting hitch on the Backbencher's part, last week's edition lacked any competitions. Very remiss. Fortunately, she has a particularly covetable prize to give away - of which more below. Meanwhile, as his constituent David McGuinness pointed out, Nick Brown was tipped to organise Gordon Brown's leadership contest back in 1996 - a job for which the Backbencher still considers him eminently suited. Congratulations. Incidentally, Nick Brown is a former Procter &amp; Gamble adman with a fine track record of persuading Middle England to plump for one washing powder over another. The slogan \"Tony washes whiter\" springs to mind - but no doubt Nick can do even better for Gordon. THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION Repeated calls to the Quiet Man's publishers had failed to elicit a copy of The Devil's Tune, his explosive thriller. So the Backbencher was touched and delighted to receive a copy from a reader who wishes to remain anonymous. \"Laura knew how high the stakes were and that others would stop at nothing to kill John...\" Yes, it's compelling stuff, with a \"flat, featureless ceiling\" and \"pumping adrenaline\" playing major roles in the drama. For a chance of winning it, tell us which top-shelf magazine the diminutive Alan Duncan has been quoting in the Commons. Email backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk. READING DIFFICULTIES You just can't please some newspapers. \"Reading Borough Council's ruling Labour group is being accused of trying to set an artificially low council tax as a vote catcher,\" reported an appalled Reading Chronicle last week. \"To keep its increases between 3.5% and 3.7% the council has rejigged its loans and leases and reduced pay awards for staff.\" Shocking stuff. Still, Reading East's rat-fancying Labour MP, Jane Griffiths, certainly needs all the help she can get in 2005. Ms Griffiths' stance on the war on Iraq - \"I believe the situation created by France left us with no alternative but military action\" - attracted much derision locally, and the MP's convoluted self-justification, which she helpfully posted on her website, badly needs a little embellishment. \"UN weapons inspectors say vast amounts of chemical and biological poisons, such as anthrax, VX nerve agent and mustard gas, remain unaccounted for in Iraq,\" she writes on Jane's the One. Jane, it's time to get with the humanitarian, WMD-related programme activities. Next time, ask Alastair to write it. BY INVITATION ONLY Meanwhile, Jane has been indignantly drawing up an early day motion. \"This house affirms the rightness of the established convention of the house, whereby honourable members must inform other honourable members whose constituency they plan to visit ... and calls upon all honourable members of all parties to observe the above courtesies,\" she wrote yesterday. Who can have upset her? It couldn't, surely, be Chris Mullin, who is visiting Reading today to \"promote the work of UK Visas\" - a euphemism for calming Daily Express-reading residents' fears about the tide of immigrants driving down unemployment and paying for Britons' pensions. (Bradford, Walthamstow and Brent are the next stops for the visa roadshow.) No, it can't be - the press release says Chris is visiting \"at the invitation of local MP Jane Griffiths.\" The Backbencher smells a rat, and it isn't one of Jane's. LET HE WHO IS WITHOUT SPIN... Now, the Backbencher knows you're all bored with 45-minute WMDs and want to move on to the big questions about foundation hospitals. As Peter Hain said at the Fabians' conference on Saturday, the 45-minute claim was virtually irrelevant in the case for war: \"I think the biggest spinners in the political debate at the present time are journalists,\" he added. It's shameful, she admits, but according to Peter we've even been making fun of the \"big conversation\". It would be unfair to remind readers of the moral transformation Peter has undergone since acquiring power, and the Backbencher certainly won't remind readers of the article he wrote in March last year for Open Democracy. \"We know from intelligence reports,\" said the leader of the Commons, \"that his most dangerous weapons remain hidden, including 550 mustard gas shells; 6,500 chemical weapons munitions; and 10,000 litres of anthrax - just one litre of which, effectively delivered, could kill millions.\" Ten thousand litres, eh? Let's just move on, as Peter suggests. THE PRINCE IS BACK Imagine the dilemma. You're a PM with a credibility problem. You badly need your backbenchers to rally round and start backing your public service reforms. You need a tough but tender enforcer whom they already respect. Who do you plump for? Is that Peter Mandelson on the line? AND THE WINNER IS... It's the moment you've all been waiting for. After weeks of suspense and frantic lobbying on the part of some of the shortlisted nominees, the Backbencher can announce the winner of her Political Weblog Awards. (Not, by the way, the \"Best Political Weblog 2004\". There's no way the Backbencher is repeating the exercise next year - at least, not without a substantial rise in her office allowance.) The accolade goes to Scott Matthewman's Gay Vote blog which tackles the single-issue agenda with admirable political impartiality - most recently picking apart Silky's beautifully opaque speech on Monday, in which he managed to extol marriage while endorsing civil partnerships. Congratulations. Runners-up, in order of votes, were Peter Cuthbertson's horribly compelling Conservative Commentary, Lynne Featherstone's GLA blog, and Councillor Stuart Bruce's blog .
