The Frenchman receives an automatic three-match ban for his dismissal at the Reebok Stadium and an extra match for each of his two other red cards this season. Queudrue, who will miss Boro's first five games of the new campaign, was also sent off against Leeds and Newcastle. Leeds United remain hopeful of concluding a deal for the permanent transfer of their French midfielder Olivier Dacourt to Roma following talks in London yesterday. The Elland Road chairman Professor John McKenzie met with representatives from the Serie A club to discuss, and potentially renegotiate, the terms for Dacourt's switch to Italy. Dacourt has spent the last four months on loan at Roma, and after a successful spell at the club, has made it clear he wants to stay there. The Aston Villa striker Dion Dublin has been fined \u00a36,000 by the Football Association for improper conduct following his sending off against Birmingham City at Villa Park on March 3. Dublin, who served an automatic three-match ban for headbutting Robbie Savage during Villa's 2-0 defeat, also faced a double charge of \"improper conduct\" relating to incidents which followed the red card. Nottingham Forest have failed with their appeal against the sending off of their centre-back Michael Dawson, who was red-carded for a late tackle on Sheffield United's Steve Kabba during the First Division play-off semi-final first-leg tie at the City Ground. The Leeds defender Gary Kelly has withdrawn from the Republic of Ireland squad for next month's European Championship qualifying double-header against Albania and Georgia due to shin splints.
