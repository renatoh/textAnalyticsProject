Figures published as part of the health service's biggest productivity drive yet show that if all GPs prescribed two generic statins - pravastatin and simvastatin - in 69% of all cases the annual drugs bill would be at least \u00a384.7m less. The top quarter of primary care trusts manage to meet this percentage but the least efficient trusts are wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds by going for more costly alternatives. One trust, Tameside and Glossop, only prescribes the cheapest statins in 31% of cases, meaning it could save \u00a3435,846 a year. Statins are at present given to 2.3 million adults, but new Nice guidelines mean anyone with a 20% risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years - up to 5.2 million adults in England - is now eligible for treatment. The volume of statins prescribing has already increased by more than 150% in the last five years, and cost the NHS around \u00a3600m in 2005. But the cost of statins varies markedly, depending on whether they are branded drugs or the generic versions, which Nice recommends GPs prescribe and are equally effective. A 28-day course of generic statins cost between \u00a31.89 and \u00a34.57, with the most expensive course being \u00a326.42. The same length course of a branded alternative costs between \u00a318.03 and \u00a329.69. Doctors often prescribe more expensive brands because they have become used to prescribing them, know they are effective, and have patients who are reluctant to swap treatment. They may not have the time to research the benefits of new drugs, and they may be unaware of the generic drugs - products whose patent has expired and so can be made more cheaply. The increase in low-cost statin prescribing is now one of 16 indicators used by the government to show how much each hospital and primary care trust in England could save if it adopted the practices of the smartest 25%. Launching the second set of quarterly figures for the \"Better care, better value\" audit, health minister Andy Burnham said: \"As new drugs become available the local NHS will increasingly have to look closely at the resources it spends on common treatments to ensure it is getting value for money. \"Statin prescription is one of the areas that can release the most savings ... clinicians can help to treat more patients by prescribing one of the lower cost drugs where it is appropriate. Nice has confirmed that generic versions of statins are as effective for most patients as their more expensive, branded counterparts.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
