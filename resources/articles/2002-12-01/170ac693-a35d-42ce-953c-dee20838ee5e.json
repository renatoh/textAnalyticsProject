Mr Knapp, speaking in public for the first time since the company entered bankruptcy protection earlier this year, also claimed that the company's complex financial restructure was almost complete. \"We're looking to complete the final loose ends any day now,\" he told the Westminster Media Forum, after the debt for equity swap aimed at cutting the company's \u00a312bn debt by \u00a37bn was held up by banks and bond holders haggling over the small print. While telecoms regulation had resulted in a competitive market around the UK, it has been a \"different story\" in the television industry, argued Mr Knapp. \"Costs for pay TV have gone up, while telephony charges have year on year gone down. The conducive regulatory environment in telecoms created competition and consumer choice - regulation hasn't caught up yet in the pay TV market,\" said Mr Knapp, who will take sole charge of the UK business at the end of the year following the resignation of managing director Stephen Carter. \"Premium pay TV rates have increased year after year for the last few years. Unlike the telecoms industry, there is no corresponding regulation on the TV side. All the TV regulators have struggled in how they approach a dominant Sky,\" he added. NTL and Telewest have long argued that the prices Sky charges for its own sports and movie channels make it hard for them to make a profit on their television services. It was also a common complaint of senior management at ITV Digital, which went bust owing more than \u00a31.1bn earlier this year. \"Out of ITV Digital, NTL and Telewest, one of those companies liquidated and two have undergone significant financial restructuring. It's not solely because of this issue, but it has played a significant part,\" said Mr Knapp, who narrowly held onto his job in the face of shareholder pressure earlier this year. He also called on Lord Currie, chairman of the proposed new super-regulator Ofcom to be quicker in reaching decisions than existing regulators. The office of fair trading has been investigating Sky's pricing policy for the past three years. A verdict on the latest investigation, which has been rumbling on for two years and was sparked by a complaint from the now defunct ITV Digital, is expected by the end of the year. \"One of the most critical elements of a converged Ofcom will be the speed with which it operates. We operate at internet speed and very often we've suffered because regulation moves at geological speed,\" he said. Mr Knapp promised that NTL, which has been losing customers over the past year since the scale of its debt crisis became apparent, would return with a vengeance once the restructuring was complete. \"Cable has had a lot of promising and not a lot of delivering over the past 10 years. But in a digital age we are poised to become the distributor of choice. \"These are highly competitive products ready to go and ready to compete vigorously against BT and Sky,\" he said, adding that the company was poised to pass the milestone of 500,000 broadband subscribers by the end of the year. The company, which has 2.7m UK subscribers, has cut 8,000 staff in the last two years and slashed its marketing costs as it paid the price for its massive acquisition spree in the late 1990s."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
