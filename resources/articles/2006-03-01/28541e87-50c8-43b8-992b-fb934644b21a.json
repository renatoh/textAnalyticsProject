In a 43-page complaint, CBS is demanding \"compensatory and punitive damages for multiple breaches of contract, fraud, unjust enrichment, and misappropriation of CBS Radio's broadcast time\". The US broadcaster wants Stern, his agent Don Buchwald and Sirius to compensate it for any financial benefits they enjoyed by promoting the satellite radio network on CBS. The original shock jock, Stern was signed by Sirius on a five-year \u00a3284m deal. He was awarded \u00a3125m of shares in the satellite radio operator after publicity surrounding his signing helped triple its subscriber base to 3.3 million. \"By engaging in continuous promotion of Sirius on CBS Radio airtime without any payment by Sirius to CBS for these advertisements and by pocketing over $200m for his personal benefit, Stern misappropriated millions of dollars worth of CBS radio airtime,\" said CBS. Stern, who joined Sirius from CBS at the beginning of this year, attacked the lawsuit as a \"personal vendetta\" which he claimed was being used to distract the media from financial results at CBS-owned radio stations. CBS also claimed that Stern continued to breach his contract \"by refusing to return property that belongs to CBS Radio - the recordings of his CBS radio programme that, under his agreement with CBS Radio, belong to this company\". \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
