As criticism of the Ryanair\u2019s treatment of affected passengers intensified, the aviation regulator told the Irish airline to explain how it will reroute passengers and email all those affected by Wednesday to explain their options. In a strongly worded letter, the CAA\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Haines, told Ryanair: \u201cThis issue is urgent, as passengers may already have been disadvantaged by taking a decision based on misleading information provided by Ryanair.\u201d Ryanair responded, saying it had reminded its customer service agents on Wednesday \u201cof the refund and re-accommodation entitlements of customers in cases of flight cancellations\u201d. But a Ryanair memo, seen by the Guardian, appears to instruct call centre staff that if offering flights with other carriers to do so provided the price \u201cdoes not exceed three times the value of the original Ryanair fare\u201d. The document was criticised by consumer group, Which? \u2013 its managing director Alex Neill said: \u201cRyanair appears to be plucking figures out of thin air as there is no legal basis for the arbitrary figure they\u2019ve set. \u201cThe law says passengers must be rerouted and there\u2019s no specified limit on cost. This yet again highlights the importance of the action which the Civil Aviation Authority has started.\u201d The CAA had said earlier that Ryanair had wrongly claimed it was not obliged to arrange new flights for passengers on rival airlines, and in his letter Haines spelt out that emails previously sent to passengers had \u201comitted material information\u201d about their rights. Ryanair came under scrutiny after announcing earlier this week that it would scrap 18,000 flights on 34 routes between November 2017 and March 2018, affecting nearly 400,000 passengers. The statement came a week after a first wave of cancellations was announced. Haines called on Ryanair to issue a press release explaining how it would reroute passengers, including a commitment to assist passengers who had already chosen an option that was not suitable for them as a result of being misled by the airline, and a promise to reimburse those affected. The latest intervention by the CAA \u2013 which has launched enforcement action against the Dublin-based carrier \u2013 came after criticism from Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister. She lamented Ryanair\u2019s \u201cdeeply regrettable\u201d decision to cancel scores of flights from Scotland, and backed the CAA\u2019s legal warnings to the airline over misleading passengers. \u201cI have serious concerns about the decisions taken by Ryanair in the past couple of days. These will cause disruption to many passengers travelling to and from Scotland to London, and indeed to other destinations in Europe,\u201d she told MSPs. \u201cWe fully support the CAA\u2019s launch of enforcement action because it is vital at the time of disruption that airlines provide full and accurate information about the rights that they [passengers] have.\u201d The Scottish transport minister, Humza Yousaf, was writing to the airline to protest against the cancellations, she said. Haines had earlier told the BBC he doubted that the dispute would end up in court, but said it was unacceptable that Ryanair was disregarding the law and customers\u2019 rights. \u201cThese are simple things to fix and they\u2019re choosing not to fix them,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t have to choose between low fares and legal rights.\u201d In his letter, sent to Ryanair\u2019s chief legal officer, Juliusz Komorek, Haines said there would be a conference call with the airline on Monday to discuss why it was taking so long to respond to the regulator\u2019s requests. Ryanair\u2019s share price had lost little ground until Thursday, when it fell by more than 4% to \u20ac16.41 (\u00a314.39), leaving its stock market value nearly \u00a31.7bn lower than before the cancellations. In a brief statement issued before the CAA letter, Ryanair said it would cooperate with the regulator: \u201cWe are meeting with the CAA and will comply fully with whatever requirements they ask us to.\u201d The CAA\u2019s intervention means the company is now fending off the displeasure of investors, regulators, politicians, passengers, pilots and cabin crew, despite its chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, attempting to bring the rostering problem under control. According to EU regulations, airlines that cancel flights are obliged to offer a refund or reroute passengers under \u201ccomparable transport conditions\u201d. Guidelines state that this should be done as soon as possible, even if it has to be with another airline. Affected services include routes from Edinburgh and Glasgow to London Stansted, and from the Scottish airports to Poland, Spain and Germany. The disruption began the previous week, when Ryanair said it would scrap up to 50 flights a day until 31 October, citing a \u201cmess-up\u201d in how it schedules time off for pilots. The airline said it had emailed affected customers to offer a refund or an alternative flight. Passengers will also receive a travel voucher for a \u00a340 one-way or \u00a380 return journey that can be used to book a Ryanair flight for travel between October 2017 and March 2018."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
