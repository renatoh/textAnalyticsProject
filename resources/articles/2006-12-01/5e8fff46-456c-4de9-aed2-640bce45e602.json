As the airline was besieged by calls from thousands of concerned passengers, it emerged that BA was alerted to the health risk on Tuesday. Airline sources said the delay was caused by a dispute between BA and the Home Office over who should contact the passengers and crew. \"There was an argument about where the ultimate responsibility for this lay and what the contact point should be,\" the source said. \"BA were saying, 'hang on a second - this is not necessarily solely our problem.'\" The government sought yesterday to reassure the public that the health risks were low, as 5,500 passengers rang a dedicated BA hotline or were contacted directly by the airline. The home secretary, John Reid, told the House of Commons that 1,700 people had called NHS Direct by 11pm on Wednesday night, and 69 of those had been referred to the Health Protection Agency. Mr Reid said 29 urine tests had been carried out for radiation exposure, of which none showed cause for concern. Most of those tested were hospital workers, many of whom were at Barnet hospital where former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko was treated on a leukaemia ward for two weeks. NHS Direct said call volumes from people worried about contamination were five times their usual level. The agency urged BA passengers not to phone unless they felt unwell. \"If somebody was on those flights and is unwell, or if they were in the Pine Bar of the Millennium Hotel or in the sushi restaurant [the London establishments where Litvinenko met contacts before he fell ill] on November 1 and they are unwell they should phone us for a clinical assessment,\" said NHS Direct's Simone Lester. \"If what they want is information about radiation, about polonium then please go to our website or go to the HPA website,\" she said. Some BA passengers complained they had not received sufficiently detailed advice from NHS Direct. The helpline said the HPA did not have enough information to give specific advice on the level of risk associated with the BA flights. Workers at an engineering plant in south Wales have also been given medical advice after seats from one of the affected planes were sent there for routine maintenance. A spokeswoman for the Health Protection Agency said: \"In any of the situations, the risk remains low. \"Whether it's on a plane or in a hotel, wherever it's found, the substance still has to find its way into the body.\" The material is likely to have been carried either as a powder or a pill, experts said. It has a half-life of 138 days so would have to be used quickly after it was prepared. Polonium 210 cannot be picked up by Geiger counters because it only emits alpha radiation, rather than gamma radiation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
