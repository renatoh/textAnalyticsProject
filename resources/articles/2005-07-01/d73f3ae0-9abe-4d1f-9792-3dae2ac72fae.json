Despite their leisure-loving image abroad, Spanish men spend more time at their jobs or at university than those in Britain, Germany, Sweden and seven other northern and eastern European countries, according to the study released this week by the BBVA Foundation in Madrid. Even Spanish women, who joined the labour force later than their neighbours, work or study more than women in Germany and Belgium. Spaniards also have less free time than in any of the 11 countries in the survey, and the number of hours they devote to sleeping - including the famous afternoon nap - is just slightly higher than average. \"There are a lot of stereotypes that come from the impressions of tourists, but in reality, Spain works a great deal,\" said Maria Angeles Duran,who led the study. Professor Duran attributed the findings to many factors, among them Spain's investment in education, the long workday, and the penchant for trabajillos, a euphemism for unofficial second jobs. The traditional siesta is alive and well in agricultural areas, where it is impossible to work the fields in the midday heat. But it is losing its appeal in the air-conditioned cities. Even the luxurious two-hour lunch breaks given in many offices are not long enough for workers to drive home for a nap. Some stereotypical patterns still hold, though. Spanish women bear the brunt of the housework and childrearing, spending an average of 4.4 hours a day on this, compared with men's 30 minutes. This is the largest gender disparity in the study. In Britain, for instance, women only spend 12 minutes more than men on chores. And the gourmet French take the lead in the number of hours spent in the kitchen: an average of three hours a day, compared with Britain's 2.1 hours and Spain's 2.34."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
