The plan to shed as many as 35 jobs from the University of Manchester\u2019s school of arts \u2013 a third of its strength \u2013 would do harm to the UK in the long run, they said. It is part of a move to cut more than 100 academic and professional support roles. \u201cA proposal to shed linguists and cross-cultural experts is clearly against the best interests of the UK, now more than ever as we face the economic and societal complexities of leaving the EU,\u201d wrote 15 senior representatives for modern languages in the UK. \u201cIf it pushes through its plans regardless, the University of Manchester will in the medium and longer term do the UK a great disservice. In the short term, it will send a powerful and ill-timed signal about the perception of the value of European languages and cultures.\u201d It emerged this month that the university planned to cut 171 jobs across the faculties of arts, languages, biology, medicine and business. It said it needed to invest in other priorities and blamed global competition and cuts to funding, among other factors, for its decision. But critics accused the institution of simply seeking excuses to cut staffing levels. The University and College Union, which represents lecturers and researchers, said it saw \u201cno economic rationale for job cuts on such an enormous scale\u201d. According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, Manchester University recorded a \u00a359.7m surplus for 2015-16, after a \u00a319.6m deficit the year before. It also holds reserves of nearly \u00a31.5bn, including \u00a3430m in cash. The signatories to the letter added: \u201cIt is worth recalling that over \u00a33m has been awarded to Manchester precisely to support and encourage research in modern languages from 2016-2020.\u201d They said that there was a false perception that students recruited to study modern languages at the university were of \u201clower quality \u2026 than the Russell Group tariff average\u201d. The academics wrote: \u201cWe have not seen hard evidence of this claim; we do know that modern languages at Manchester have a stellar reputation nationally and internationally, and that the areas targeted for radical reduction have excellent student ratings for teaching quality as well as very significant research power. \u201cRecent harsh marking in modern languages A-levels has led to a mistaken perception of applicants as being of \u2018lower quality\u2019; and at a time when there is a clear need to stimulate recruitment for modern languages across higher education, we urge the university to address the issue positively and proactively in the context of a proven and urgent need for graduates with languages in the UK.\u201d \u201cThe University of Manchester has a bold ambition to be a world-leading institution with a reputation based on academic excellence,\u201d said a spokesman for the university. \u201cIn order to meet this ambition, we must improve the quality of our research and student experience in some areas and ensure the financial sustainability of the university. Realising this ambition will require a capacity to invest in our strategic priorities. \u201cWe have detailed plans for significant growth in funds from a range of activities, but we will also need to make cost savings. On 3 May, the board of governors approved proposals from the senior staff of the university to commence consultation with the trade unions in relation to reductions of up to 171 posts. \u201cThe university proposes to open a voluntary severance scheme for staff at risk, to avoid the need for compulsory redundancy if at all possible.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
