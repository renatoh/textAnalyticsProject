Every club has a group who know deep down that if everyone is fit and on form, the realistic hope is for a place on the bench, some cup games, and the odd crack when the first choice in their position needs a breather. The art of fine management includes an ability to make those players feel wanted, valued, and motivated to be ready to step up and step in the second they are needed. Mauricio Pochettino keeps that in mind around the training ground and wants that inclusive atmosphere to permeate Spurs Lodge. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s teamwork,\u201d he says. \u201cFootball is a collective thing, but it\u2019s not only 11 players. It\u2019s 25 players, and the 25 players need to be always ready to fight and be available to give the best every time that you need them.\u201d It has been one of the extraordinary aspects of Spurs\u2019 defensive record \u2013 the best in the Premier League with a mere 16 goals conceded \u2013 that they have done so without core defenders at different periods of the campaign. Danny Rose is the latest to spend some time out, joining Jan Vertonghen on the injury list, while Toby Alderweireld missed two months not so long ago. Together with Kyle Walker most would agree that makes the first-choice back line. Even though Pochettino made a habit of changing his full-backs last season, he started this term keener on that established back four. But they have been able to link up as a quartet in just eight of the 24 games. \u201cWhen you play in four competitions, plus the international games, sometimes it\u2019s not the number one that will be decisive to achieve big things. Maybe it\u2019s the player that is waiting for his moment that, in a key game, in a key period of the season, you need to put in and they need to perform well and help the team,\u201d the manager says. \u201cSometimes you win games because the performance of the player that replaces your number one is good, and in 10 minutes changes the game, and you can win. I think we need to talk about that with more respect to the people that are waiting for the possibility to play. For me they are not a number, they are people that feel, that have emotions, and it\u2019s very, very tough when you cannot give the possibility to play, and then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, they are training hard, hard, hard. The people that do not play train harder than the players that are involved on the weekend. That is the value and you can appreciate that.\u201d This philosophy is reflected in those who have come into the team, like Ben Davies and Kevin Wimmer slotting in at the back. Eric Dier has repositioned himself comfortably when called upon. Pochettino says that the team\u2019s defensive attitude owes something to the whole squad. \u201cIt is not because of the goalkeeper and centre-back and full-back \u2013 it is about the organisation of the team, and that is not only 11 but 25 players who work a lot. They need to be organised and focused when we don\u2019t have the ball, work hard on pressing and closing and fighting.\u201d He is also pleased with the number of players in his squad who bring leadership qualities. As well as the usual suspects, starting from Hugo Lloris, who brings his experience as captain for club and country, the Tottenham manager picked out Dele Alli as one whose influence is evolving. \u201cAlli\u2019s personality and character, maybe he becomes a leader in a few years,\u201d he says. Tottenham are intent on maintaining those hungry qualities as they head to Liverpool for a match Pochettino accepts has an extra resonance. He is still very much looking upwards, not over his shoulder. \u201cWe are not the only realistic challengers,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are next after Chelsea and it\u2019s a fact we are a contender today. Then there are a lot of teams who are contenders. Nine points is a massive gap but it is not decisive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
