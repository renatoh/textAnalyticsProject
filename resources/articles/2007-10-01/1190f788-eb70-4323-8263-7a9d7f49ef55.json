Ali Larijani quit as secretary of the supreme national security council after repeated clashes with Ahmadinejad over tactics. His resignation came as a revolutionary guard commander said it will fire back thousands of rockets on 'enemy' bases if attacked. Iran has repeatedly refused to suspend its uranium enrichment programme - suspected by the US and its allies as a front for building an atomic bomb - in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions. Larijani's resignation was announced by Ahmadinejad's spokesman, Gholamhossein Elham, who said Larijani had offered to resign several times in recent months. 'Larijani had resigned repeatedly. Finally the president accepted his resignation,' Elham said. Insiders depicted the development as a victory for Ahmadinejad in a power struggle between his radical supporters and more traditional conservatives for control of the nuclear issue. They said it reflected increasing support for the president from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, and a determination on the Islamic regime's part not to capitulate to UN demands. Larijani's resignation was tendered and accepted last week, but its announcement delayed, possibly to avoid overshadowing the visit to Tehran of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, who last Tuesday became the first Kremlin leader to go to Iran since Stalin in 1943. Larijani was said to have offered to quit during a meeting in which Ahmadinejad criticised his 'semi-independent' negotiating style. The president told him to put it in writing. Saeed Jalili, deputy foreign minister for European and American affairs, who is believed to have become increasingly influential on the nuclear issue , will succeed Larijani. Elham said the new appointment would not affect policy. 'Iran's nuclear policies are stabilised and unchangeable. Managerial change won't bring any changes in policies,' he said. However, the change is seen as signalling an even tougher stance by Iran towards the UN. 'It shows that the confrontation between Iran and the UN will reach an even higher point and the answer to all the demands will be, we will continue on our path and we don't care what comes out of the security council,' Issa Saharkhiz, a Tehran-based political commentator, said. The security council has already passed two mild sets of sanctions against Iran for failing to suspend enrichment. A decision on a third embargo has been postponed until at least next month. Russia and China have been dragging their feet over demands from the US, Britain and France for tougher measures. The Bush administration has refused to rule out military strikes. After Putin's visit, Larijani said the Russian leader had offered a proposal for resolving the dispute, but he was contradicted by Ahmadinejad. Larijani had gained a reputation for being willing to engage with the West, despite not wanting to abandon Iran's nuclear activities. However, he said that his negotiating strategy was being undercut by Ahmadinejad's uncompromising rhetoric."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
