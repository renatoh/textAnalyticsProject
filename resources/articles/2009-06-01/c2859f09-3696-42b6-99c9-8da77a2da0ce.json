I am allowed one withdrawal a year and was in the habit of making that withdrawal on the anniversary, 13 April, believing the term had ended and I was then reinvesting a lesser amount for the next year. The problem arises when 13 April is a Sunday or bank holiday and Halifax is not open for business. Last year the 13th fell on a Sunday. I was unable to make my withdrawal until the following day. I later realised that this could be interpreted as using up my one annual withdrawal for the following year so I wrote to Halifax. The bank acknowledged that this was indeed the case but, as a goodwill gesture, it made a manual adjustment. So I believed I had in hand my one withdrawal for the new year. This time, 13 April was Easter Monday. Halifax said I could make the withdrawal on the 14th and it would backdate it to the 13th. In fact I made the withdrawal on 6 April but was then told I had made two withdrawals the previous year. I realised the account was unworkable and decided to close it on 14 April. I received a cheque but with no bonus. I produced the letter showing that last year's withdrawal had been backdated and spent an hour while the branch manager tried to get some sense from HQ. I had to return the next day, a journey of some miles, but it still hadn't been sorted out. CB, Fairlight, East Sussex Halifax staff had backdated last year's withdrawal but the computer refused to allow it, so your record still showed that you had made two withdrawals in 12 months. Someone has now manually calculated the bonus and sent you a cheque for the bonus with an extra \u00a330 to compensate for the time and travelling you had to make. \u2022 Email Margaret Dibben at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Margaret Dibben, Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU and include a telephone number.
