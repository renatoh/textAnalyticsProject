Gueye has been linked with several other Premier League clubs, including Southampton, West Ham United and Crystal Palace, but Villa have agreed a fee with Lille and hope to finalise the signing of the 25-year-old within the next 24 hours. Gueye has played more than 130 games for Lille since making his debut for the Ligue 1 club in 2010 and would become Tim Sherwood\u2019s second signing of the summer, following Micah Richards\u2019 move from Manchester City on a four-year contract last month. The Senegalese international, who has also been attracting interest from Marseille, could be Villa\u2019s biggest outlay in the transfer market for four years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
