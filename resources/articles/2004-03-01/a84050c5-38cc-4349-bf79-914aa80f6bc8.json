Amazingly, he oversteps, which at his pace is criminal. It's been an excellent session for the Windies, who have recovered from the early loss of Chanderpaul and have really taken the attack to England: 104 runs in that session. And there are still 39 overs in the day to go. Join me at 8.05pm GMT to find out who will take the honours in the final session. 50th over: West Indies 183-4 (Smith 96, Hinds 36) Smith moves to 96 with a smart drive for three as he uses his feet to Giles. Five off the over - which by recent standards represents something of a triumph for poor old Ashley. \"If you have the Wadham darts team reading, could I ask if any of them played in possibly the only darts final ever to be abandoned for violence against the Corpus evil pixies?\" asks Charlie Talbot. \"Including one Philip Trotter managing to start a fight with himself, before clearing an entire Somerville bar with his foul mouthed outbursts before the Lennox Lewis fight? 49th over: West Indies 178-4 (Smith 93, Hinds 34) Flintoff is a whisker away from finding the outside edge of Hinds, who drives optimistically at a ball that bounces and leaves him. Flintoff winces, and well he might: we're barely halfway through. It's going to be a late night. Hang on, here's Dave Tarrant again. \"Petrus, a Gordon Ramsey in London,\" he suggests. \"The most expensive wine on the list is over \u00a310,000.\" First you insult me, Dave. Then you just show off. 48th over: West Indies 177-4 (Smith 93, Hinds 33) Back comes Giles, possibly to atone for a shocking first spell of 2-0-20-0. But his first ball is even worse, and Hinds helps him to long leg for four. Oh dear, oh dear. Hinds sweeps for a single, before Hinds sweeps for two. It's all too easy at the moment. \"You're doing an excellent job,\" writes Dave Tarrant in Denver. \"Even if you lack a little of the colour brought by TMS - champagne moment, description of the DJ, steel band, and of your drunken evening out in the Montego Bay fish restaurant with namecheck for the maitre'd - maybe when you have a little time at the interval. What do you say?\" Through gritted teeth, Dave, I would point out that TMS have made no headway whatsoever in finding a restaurant for Charlie Wilson and his mum. We already have a nomination. In Skye. 47th over: West Indies 170-4 (Smith 91, Hinds 28) England need to exploit the fact that Smith is approaching his maiden Test century. And the signs from that Flintoff over - which cost only a single - are that they have cottoned on. Daniel Hodgkin has a suggestion for Charlie Wilson and his mum. \"Take her to the Three Chimneys Restaurant, in the North end of Skye,\" he sniggers. \"Although the price is (I think) reasonable given the superb quality, the travel costs should more than make up for it.\" Evil, Daniel. Pure evil. 46th over: West Indies 169-4 (Smith 91, Hinds 27) That was a tidier over from Jones, but England don't seem to be bowling with a plan like they did in the morning session. \"I do hope Sultoon replies tomorrow,\" writes Sean Morley, who seems to be writing from Boston in the US of A. \"I want to know what happened to his erstwhile companions, Oscar and Damage - and the rest of the Exeter darts team who has stupid names. Please do print this as I want to hear from Sultoon, and I know many of my darts colleagues from Wadham read this religiously, so I can achieve lasting fame.\" Aha! It all becomes clear. 45th over: West Indies 167-4 (Smith 90, Hinds 26) Giles is out of the attack after bowling two overs for 20, so back comes Flintoff, who goes up for a half-hearted shout for caught behind against Smith. \"Not out\" says umpire Harper correctly. The Windies have been scoring at a run a ball for the last 11 overs or so - the pendulum has definitely swung their way as Smith moves into the 90s. \"Do we have the pleasure of your company for the whole five days?\" wonders Steve Walker in Ottawa. \"Or do you have to relinquish the hot seat at some time and let someone else help us through our \"working\" day?\" In theory, I'm here for five days, Steve. If England continue to bowl 12 overs an hour, it will feel more like six. 44th over: West Indies 163-4 (Smith 87, Hinds 25) More runs! Smith on-drives Jones beautifully for four, then tucks the next ball off his hips to the square-leg fence. England are in danger of throwing away their advantage here and Vaughan is starting to fume quietly. Charlie Wilson clearly loves his mother. \"I wonder if anyone can help me out?\" he asks. \"I've just won a bet with my Mum for dinner at a place in the UK of my choice. So in order to twist the knife, I want to make her take me to the most expensive restaurant in the UK. Any suggestions?\" 43rd over: West Indies 153-4 (Smith 86, Hinds 17) Smith picks up two runs to third man with an involuntary edge off Giles, and then repeats the fluke a few balls later. Giles can't quite believe it. But there's nothing streaky about the next shot - a full-blooded drive down the ground for four to bring up the 50 stand in no time at all. Giles has bowled two overs for 20 and England need a wicket. 42nd over: West Indies 145-4 (Smith 78, Hinds 17) Back comes Jones, who is immediately crashed through the covers by the aggressive Hinds. Vaughan is really ringing the changes here, but the only consequence at the moment seems to be that no one is able to find their rhythm. 41st over: West Indies 141-4 (Smith 78, Hinds 13) Enter Ashley Giles, who makes a shocking start. His first ball is outside leg and is swept comfortably to the fine-leg fence by Smith. The next is the compensatory long-hop, which Smith chops through point for four more. I'm beginning to wish I hadn't made that gag about Smith scoring a hundred when he had about 15. Smith takes a single into the covers, before Hinds gets in on the act, sweeping a poor delivery for three. The runs are coming thick and fast here: 12 off Giles's first over. \"Is the Sultoon you mentioned in over 3 the \"Fat Boy\" Sultoon of Exeter College dart's team fame?\" wonders Sean Morley. \"If so, I bid him good day.\" I fear you'll have to wait until tomorrow for your answer, Sean. 40th over: West Indies 129-4 (Smith 69, Hinds 10) Hinds gets away with another loose stroke as a firm-footed drive at Harmison flies just out of reach of Mark Butcher in the gully and away for four. Third man has been a profitable scoring area for the Windies today. Vaughan's reponse is to strenghten the slip cordon - there are now three slips and two gullies. Harmison's response is to hit Hinds in the youknowwots. Sniggers all round as Hinds rolls around in agony. \"I had a dream last night about Frederick Flintoff,\" reveals Tristan Haley-Burrows. \"He was wandering around what looked like Bulawayo, with that girl who was in Roger Sanchez' \"another chance\" video (carrying around the big red heart etc). I wonder what the dream weavers would make of that.\" I shudder to think, Tristan. 39th over: West Indies 124-4 (Smith 69, Hinds 6) Jones replaces Hoggard, which suggests Michael Vaughan is trying to use his quicks in short bursts. No sign of Ashley Giles yet. But Smith is starting to unleash some strokes now and spanks Jones through extra cover for four with Trescothick-like foot movement, ie none at all. \"That will do nicely, thank you,\" writes the fact-hungry Tom Adam (see over 36). 38th over: West Indies 120-4 (Smith 65, Hinds 6) Smith returns to streaky-edge mode as Harmison induces a flat-footed push that flies low and fast out of Flintoff's reach at second slip and away for four. That's Smith's highest Test score in his fifth game, and a cut for one next ball takes him to 65. Angered, Harmison rattles Hinds on the helmet. But he's got the wrong man! \"Was that Andrea Lowe's first contribution?\" wonders Tom Walden-Jones. \"I seem to remember that she was a regular last year and got involved in some attempted matchmaking with some of your male correspondants during the Ashes. Was that successful, I wonder, or is she still looking?\" Why, Tom? You asking? 37th over: West Indies 115-4 (Smith 60, Hinds 6) Hinds is a lucky boy after playing the definitive chinese cut to a ball from Hoggard that holds its line. Read can't get to the edge in time and that's four runs. That could so easily have been a repeat of the Chanderpaul wicket. But at least the runs are coming for the Windies. Here's dean blackmore, who seems to like lower-case letters. \"as much as i never advocate backing england those odds look good bearing in mind the windies only have 100 on the board, a batsman who by all accounts is leading a charmed life (Smith) and only two more recognised batsmen after this partnership to come.\" 36th over: West Indies 111-4 (Smith 60, Hinds 2) Harmison gives Smith some rare width, and that's a classy cut for four. Next ball is even wider, and Smith repeats the dose, this time with a real flourish. For once, that's poor bowling from Harmison, who decides to go round the wicket to cut down the angle. \"Do keep up!\" exhorts Tom Adam. \"Any sign of swing yet? Is there any cloud cover, if there's a 30% chance of rain? Is Harmison in \"mean\" or \"mild\" mode?\" To deal with your queries in order, Tom: yes, yes, meanish. Will that do? 35th over: West Indies 103-4 (Smith 52, Hinds 2) The new batsman is Ryan Hinds, yet another left-hander. He's off the mark first ball with a confident push for two through the covers. Stephen Follows is back. \"Oh, now I see,\" he japes. \"So different places in the world have their own clocks, do they? I knew Switzerland had their own cuckoo clocks, but I didn't realise it had spread so far. Does the UN know about it? Then again, it would explain why everyone I know in New Zealand seems to work night shifts, except when I'm there.\" Good grief. WICKET! Chanderpaul b Hoggard 7 (101-4) Chanderpaul nibbles at one just outside off and gets a thick inside edge onto his leg stump. Just what England needed! 34th over: West Indies 100-3 (Smith 52, Chanderpaul 7) Harmison bangs it in short to Smith, who's happy to sway out of the way. Harmison should get a shirt that fits him - he's forever tugging at the material on his shoulder. Just thought I'd share that with you. A maiden. \"Screw this,\" writes Andrea Lowe. \"Pub beckons. Night.\" I'll do my best to soldier on. 33rd over: West Indies 100-3 (Smith 52, Chanderpaul 7) Chanderpaul brings up the West Indies hundred with a pull for four off Hoggard, who seems to be testing out a theory that Chanderpaul doesn't like bouncers. Might be time for Plan B. Here's Steve Hart with the latest odds: \"West Indies 15/8, Draw 6/4, England 7/4.\" 32nd over: West Indies 96-3 (Smith 52, Chanderpaul 3) Steve Harmison replaces Flintoff (8-2-17-0) and raps Smith on the glove as he attempts to drop his hands out of the way. Unfortunately for England the resulting ricochet falls two feet short of Chris Read behind the stumps. I've just realised that I haven't mentioned Read until now, which presumably means he's kept very tidily. One leg-bye off that over. \"Well Lawrence, I finally made it,\" says Stephen Walker, who comes from Ottawa. \"I'm sorry I'm late - I spent my morning attempting to learn French. After moving here from the UK I discovered you have to be bilingual to get anywhere in the government, which really sucks for me as the closest I ever got to speaking French was the occasional beer run over to Calais for the cheap booze. Oh, the fond memories of weaving in and out of the Renaults and Citroens as we pushed shopping carts piled high with crates of beer down the road back to the ferry terminal.\" Glad you could make it, Steve. I think... 31st over: West Indies 95-3 (Smith 52, Chanderpaul 3) Matthew Hoggard is on for Jones, whose first spell back in Test cricket was a highly creditable 6-1-20-1. Hoggard bustles in hard from the start, but when he drops short, Chanderpaul pulls him for a single. The Barmy Army unleash their first rendition of \"Who we are/Where we come from etc etc\" and are immediately drowned out by some reggae which is blasted out over the tannoy. nice. \"Like Dane Stanley, I am at work,\" reports Steve Hart. \"However, it is actually okay, nay necessary, for me to watch the cricket as I am compiling live betting odds.\" What odds an England win, Steve? 30th over: West Indies 93-3 (Smith 51, Chanderpaul 2) Chanderpaul is watchful - when is he anything but? - as Flintoff attempts to angle the ball across him. A quiet maiden. I said we'd have no more on the synonyms, but Conor Fitzpatrick has come up with a gem. \"At a match in Donemanagh in Northern Ireland, where a batsman biffed a six into the nearby stream, a spectator described him as having \"skaylp'd it into the drink. 'Scealp' it turns out is the gaelic word for 'splinter' or 'split'.\" Not much skaylping to report when Chanderpaul's at the crease, Conor, but thanks all the same. 29th over: West Indies 93-3 (Smith 51, Chanderpaul 2) Smith moves to his half-century with a corruscating cut for four as Jones drops short and wide. Needless to say, it went in the air. That was his ninth four in 92 balls, which is a reasonable strike-rate. Not all of them have been convincing, mind. I'm slightly concerned that Stephen Follows hasn't got the hang of this time-zone malarkey. \"What are these people doing having lunch at 5pm?\" he asks, tongue nowhere near cheek. \"Is this the laid-back Caribbean lifestyle gone mad? Something should be done! Gah!\" 28th over: West Indies 87-3 (Smith 46, Chanderpaul 1) Flintoff is back over the wicket now (not that I'm obsessed or anything), and Smith keeps the scoreboard ticking over with a single via his hip to midwicket. There's a no-ball too - Flintoff's fourth - but England are quietly in control. \"Can you start earlier tomorrow so my day is filled with more frantic clicking of the refresh button and not so much work stuff?\" asks Dane Stanley. \"Keep my name anon. Don't know if any of the people in the office are cricket fans. New job and all.\" Your secret's safe with us, Dane Stanley. 27th over: West Indies 85-3 (Smith 45, Chanderpaul 1) Simon Jones continues from the Blue Mountains End. The sun has gone in, which will please England more than the Windies, but there is a 30% chance of rain today. Apparently. Smith takes a single to midwicket. The only criticism of the attack so far today is that they have drifted onto the left-handers' pads occasionally. \"One person I have heard of left his job in the service to become an apprentice funeral director,\" writes David Brady. \"They bought him a patch of land in a cemetery, the humorous bunch. What did they think he was going to do with it? Practice?\" Your guess is as good as mine, David. 26th over: West Indies 84-3 (Smith 44, Chanderpaul 1) Welcome back, assuming you haven't left work already. Andrew Flintoff (5-1-13-0 before lunch) takes up the attack from the Headley Stand End and chugs in over the wicket under cloudy skies to Devon Smith. A quick wicket, and England will be right on top. Smith plays a checked drive for two through mid-off, but is then hit on the right forearm by the next delivery as he turns his back on a short one. Ouch! Nick Denny has a contribution to make to the leaving-present riff. \"We got a guy who used to work with us a Lego robotic monkey as a leaving present,\" he screams. \"And some cheese. Us crazy crazy software engineers, eh?\" Yep."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
