The Newcastle manager\u2019s deal ends next month and while there is a mutual desire to renew it several sticking points have slowed discussions with the club\u2019s owner. Things appear to have reached an impasse. \u201cBehind the scenes we were talking and now we\u2019re in the same situation,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the same position. I am waiting for answers. When you have negotiations you have to talk, then they give you this or that. It\u2019s just part of the normal Brexit talks.\u201d Newcastle\u2019s version of the Irish backstop is Ben\u00edtez\u2019s desire to blend youth and experience. To do so, he requires freedom to recruit players aged over 25, something Ashley has never been keen on as the owner believes such signings lack resale value. \u201cIf you want to win trophies you need experience,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez as he prepared for Friday night\u2019s game at Leicester, where a win would in effect banish Newcastle\u2019s lingering relegation worries. \u201cAnd at the same time as experience, you need the energy levels, determination and hunger that young players have.\u201d He created such a blend, to successful effect, in Italy. \u201cWe showed it\u2019s important to find this balance. When I arrived at Napoli the president said: \u2018We\u2019ll sell Edinson Cavani.\u2019 We sold him for around \u00a360m to Paris Saint-Germain, then we reinvested the money to make a team that could compete in Europe. He had this vision and he did it really well. \u201cFor around \u00a360m we signed Pepe Reina, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n, Dries Mertens and Ra\u00fal Albiol. Afterwards, we signed younger players and then we built a team. Eventually they sold Jorginho for \u00a357m and Higua\u00edn for \u00a390m. Just with these two players we doubled the money. It\u2019s about finding the balance between profit and investing.\u201d If those words represented a not so subtle appeal to Ashley, Ben\u00edtez reinforced the point with some admiring comments about the Leicester side inherited by Brendan Rodgers. \u201cLeicester have players with experience and good young players,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good team.\u201d Ben\u00edtez is considering switching from three to four at the back following the ruptured cruciate ligament suffered by Florian Lejeune last Saturday. The defender faces fast-track surgery on his left knee in Rome where a surgeon uses a pioneering technique that enabled Lejeune to make an unusually speedy recovery after his right knee required a cruciate repair last summer. \u201cIn four months he was fine when normally it takes six or seven months,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said. \u201cHe was really unlucky that his other knee has the same injury now but hopefully in five months he should be fine.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
