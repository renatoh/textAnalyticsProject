The 15-year-old has scored an astonishing 34 goals in 20 games for Dortmund\u2019s under-19 side this season, providing nine assists. Under previous rules Moukoko would not have been able to play in the Bundesliga until August 2021. The new rules states that any player can feature as soon as they have turned 16. \u201cWe are very pleased with this decision,\u201d the Dortmund academy director, Lars Ricken, told Kicker. \u201cThis could help the clubs but also the young players in their development. A majority of the clubs want to be able to give outstanding talents, on very rare occasions, the chance to take the next step in their development.\u201d The rule change will be implemented for the 2020-21 season, with Moukoko celebrating his 16th birthday on 20 November. He scored 50 league goals for the under-17s in 2018-19 \u2013 a new German record \u2013 and his 34 goals for the under-19s this season is also an all-time high. He reached that mark with six games of the season to go."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
