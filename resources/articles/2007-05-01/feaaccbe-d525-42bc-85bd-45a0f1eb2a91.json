Aside from the intro of the opener, 'Get Lucky', the debut by the Tahita Bulmer-led quintet owes markedly more to disco-punk trailblazers ESG than any serotonin-starved fluorescent adolescents. Twitchy, energising and frequently filthy, tracks such as 'Jerk Me', 'Get Lucky' and 'Ice Cream' fuse the whiplash rhythms of the aforementioned group with a spiky pop sensibility, suggesting that NYPC are too canny to align themselves with any spurious, short-lived sound."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
