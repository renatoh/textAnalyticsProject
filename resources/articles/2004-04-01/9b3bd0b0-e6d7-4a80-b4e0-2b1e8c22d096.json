Chelsea conceded an advantage they will be hard put to nullify in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final after Ranieri's bizarre second-half substitutions undermined the good work which had allowed his team to draw Monaco's sting in the first 45 minutes. Ranieri's decision to withdraw the ineffectual Jesper Gronkjaer at half-time was no surprise. To send on Juan Sebasti\u00e1n V\u00e9ron, patently lacking match fitness after a prolonged absence through injury, was rapidly exposed as a major error of judgment. Never able to adjust to the pace of a keenly fought match, the Argentina international merely cluttered his team's patterns in midfield, while presenting no hindrance to Monaco's 10 men. The insertion of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in place of Mario Melchiot after 62 minutes, and of Robert Huth for Scott Parker six minutes later, further damaged the cohesion so carefully built up in the opening period, when Frank Lampard controlled the match and Hernan Crespo made good his promise to repay some of his \u00a316m transfer fee by equalising Dado Prso's opening goal. A formation of three strikers produced a less impressive result than the two of the first half, Hasselbaink squandering numerous opportunities. As Fernando Morientes and Shabani Nonda exploited Chelsea's confusion to strike their goals in the last 15 minutes, the Tinkerman got his comeuppance - something which, to his great credit, he refused afterwards to deny. Before the match, however, he had struck his own blow. Each football manager has his particular way of preparing for a big game but the Italian's method of setting the tone for last night's game was astonishing even by the standards of a man Chelsea's fans have come to cherish as a genial eccentric. After winning applause for keeping his feelings to himself during months of humiliating speculation about his future Ranieri chose the eve of per haps the most important match in the club's history to let his emotions and opinions run free. In the process he gave perhaps a more accurate impression of the hard professional operator lurking behind the fractured English and the cartoon-like gestures. \"Look,\" Ranieri said, in the course of what must rate as one of the most unconventional pre-match interviews in the history of European football, \"I already have the Abramovich sword embedded in me.\" Talking to a Spanish reporter, he chose to unburden himself of almost a year of frustration. \"I'm convinced that, even if I win the Champions League, I'll get the sack,\" he said. Ranieri's frankness was extraordinary, particularly when it came to discussing the relationship between Chelsea's new owner and the England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson. \"Ever since he arrived at the club Abramovich wanted Eriksson,\" Ranieri told Marca, one of Madrid's daily sports papers. \"From the very start. They even met in the summer. But Eriksson said he couldn't leave the England team and so the next day Abramovich met me and told me: 'OK, you've done a good job these last few years and you are going to carry on.' \"Abramovich knows nothing about football,\" Ranieri continued. \"That's the real shame. If he had understood what my side had achieved that season, he would have valued me more highly. We did it all without any money.\" Ranieri was right to demand admiration for his achievements last season, when his side showed every sign of developing a strong collective character, something not always in evidence at Stamford Bridge. But the Russian oligarch's keenness to spend \u00a3110m on new players for this season undermined the integrity of that work while creating a new set of problems for a manager who quickly came to resemble a lame duck. \"It was a very tough job to sign so many players and get them to play together,\" Ranieri said. \"Abramovich didn't realise that. He thought I'll sign that one and that one and then we will win.\" For 45 minutes last night old faces and new responded to the challenge with a combination of passion and pragmatism that did credit to them- selves and to their manager. And then Ranieri forgot that it is not the manager who kicks the ball. The players are not puppets. After striving to impose a pattern on the match, and having succeeded in making Monaco look underpowered, they found their strings being cut. Ironically enough, Claude Makelele's success in getting Andreas Zikos sent off probably contributed to the renewal of Monaco's motivation. Suddenly they were counter-attacking with pace and directness, exploiting the spaces left by Chelsea's bewildered defenders. In that sense defeat for Chelsea last night represented justice for Zikos and Monaco. We may never know Abramovich's reaction to his manager's criticisms. But, if Ranieri can already feel the edge of the Russian's sword, at least he has let him know what a stiletto between the shoulder blades feels like."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
