Congratulations on your decision to come and play cricket in Zimbabwe. We were interested to be informed that a spokesman of the Department of Culture stated: \" We are pleased the ECB has made it clear players will not take part in Mugabe's propaganda\" . What a cynical piece of crap! By coming to Zimbabwe in the first instance, Your Players ARE, wittingly or unwittingly, taking part in Mugabe's propaganda. Our message to you is simple: COME TO ZIMBABWE AND YOU WILL GO BACK TO BRITAIN IN WOODEN COFFINS! Mugabe's thugs and a huge opposing group are like two chemicals waiting for a catalyst to spark a violent reaction. Your visit to Zimbabwe will provide precisely that catalyst and there's going to be one mighty bang. The England players and a load of Zimbabweans will die in the carnage. Of course, Mugabe and his henchmen will assure you that they will protect you, and if you seek and accept that assurance are you not, in actual fact, conniving with his murderous regime? And all for what? Money? One black Zimbabwean's life is worth a damn sight more than \u00a35m. So, all you can think of is money when Black men, women and children are being tortured, murdered, beaten up and starved on a daily basis. Did you know that there is a facility at Goromonzi, a few miles outside Harare, which looks like a covered public swimming pool? The only difference is that the pool is covered with concentrated Sulphuric Acid. Anybody who opposes Mugabe ends up in there - dissolved and with no trace left behind. A bit like the Concentration Camps in Nazi Germany, or is your memory so short that you have already forgotten? Anyway, we know your Team. Come to Harare and you will die. And how safe are your families back there in the UK? Even if you survive, there are foreign groups who are prepared to hunt you and your families down for as long as it takes, and they will do that in your own very country. Our advice is this: DON'T COME TO ZIMBABWE OR YOUR PLAYERS WILL BE LIVING IN FEAR FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. Yours sincerely Sons and Daughters of ZIMBABWE"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
