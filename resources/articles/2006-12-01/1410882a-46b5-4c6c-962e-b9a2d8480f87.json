This will help to lessen the shock to its system before it gets to do its annual looking-pretty stint. Indoors, heat sources such as open fires and radiators (even the TV during those Only Fools And Horses marathons) are desiccating, so keep the tree well away from them, and give it plenty of water. You can smooth the passage of its new year eviction by carrying out the same conditioning before putting it out. Expose your snails Snails may not currently be causing any damage, but that doesn't mean they're not thinking evil thoughts. They hibernate over winter under stones and in forgotten pots at the bottom of the garden, ready to emerge, well-rested and starving, in spring. Expose their hiding places now; the thrushes will do your dirty work for you and there will be a lower population to lay waste to your seedlings. Plant it now The red flowers of Hamamelis 'Diane' are subtler than the usual yellow witch hazels, but its citrus scent will fill the garden on mild winter days. 'Diane' has particularly fine autumn foliage, too. Plant in fertile, moist, neutral to acid soil in sun or partial shade. Readers can order one shrub in a four-litre pot for \u00a339.95 or two for \u00a369.90. Call 0870 836 0908, quoting ref GUPW64. Price includes UK mainland p&amp;p.
