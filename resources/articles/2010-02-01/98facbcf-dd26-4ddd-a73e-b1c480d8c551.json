But take heart: David L Williams's comedy is a notch more watchable than you might imagine. Stephen Mangan and Bellamy's People star Rhys Thomas are best friends who hatch a wacky plan to tackle the north pole in carbon neutral, veggie-friendly style, as part of a quarter-baked campaign to save the planet. This is gummy (if welcome) eco-film satire, then, but mostly just a vehicle for tent and crampon gags, and for Mangan to perfect his grating-dolt shtick."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
