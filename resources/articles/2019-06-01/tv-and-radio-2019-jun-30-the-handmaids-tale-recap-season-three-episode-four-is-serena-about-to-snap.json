Please do not add spoilers for later episodes in the series. You can find recaps for previous episodes here Surely this must be the episode in which Serena sticks an amputated finger up to the patriarchy and joins the revolution. How much negging can one woman take? As is so often the case in these Amma Asante-directed instalments, we begin with beautiful imagery, shot from above. \u201cIt takes a village. And machine guns,\u201d says June to us in voiceover as the handmaids cross the bridge where Janine tried to jump. Later, when the handmaids arrive at the Putnam house, they place their bonnets on a round table in flower formation; Asante\u2019s lens again frames the rosette from above. And, with that incredible aerial shot of the staircase that looks like an eye, the handmaids climb on their way to the thanksgiving service. The good old days We move around this week, flashing back to Hannah\u2019s christening in the old US where the worst thing Luke and June had to worry about was where to eat lunch. June\u2019s mother badmouths the church and their decision to baptise the baby. But it\u2019s largely a happy occasion, allowing Elisabeth Moss to smile for the first time ages. Canada The Canada scenes this week depict the awkward, heartbreaking reunion between Emily and her wife and son. I\u2019ll admit to more than a few tears as the little boy passed his dinosaur book to his mother and asked her to read to him. Emily and Sylvia\u2019s reunion is bursting with the unsaid. So much appalling baggage now sits between them. How do you reconcile with an emotionally ravaged wife who has endured years of serial rape and female genital mutilation? The little boy\u2019s superhero picture of Emily \u201ctrying to get back to them\u201d is almost too much to bear. Not to mention his very grownup assertion that he shouldn\u2019t hug her until she is ready. That child is adorable and slowly bridges the gap between them. They don\u2019t know how to be together now. Gilead Back in snowy Gilead, the handmaids are transported in the red van to a reception at the Putnam house, where Janine knows she will see her daughter, Angela. The sense of the unpredictable always makes Janine\u2019s scenes thrilling, but so often end with brutality. I almost reinstated the Grim Scale from previous seasons\u2019 recaps this week after Lydia\u2019s gruesome attack on Janine. When she has the temerity to openly express what all the handmaids must be thinking \u2013 \u201cI want to be with my daughter\u201d \u2013 the Aunt unleashes a screaming tirade while clobbering her with a cosh. It is so brutal that even the commanders and their wives look on in abject horror. So Lydia has gone nuclear. All the women in this regime experience such ridiculous amounts of pressure, it\u2019s no wonder the dams are beginning to burst. As June negotiates the brittle reunification of the Waterford marriage (for her own political ends, obviously) the party continues. All her efforts now are towards Serena who has reappeared from her sabbatical at her mum\u2019s house. She is not ready to forgive Fred, but June\u2019s subtle inquiries about offering Serena a more active role behind the scenes get some interest, so desperate is Fred to save face and get his marriage looking respectable again. June meets Serena\u2019s \u201cWhat have I missed?\u201d with a dry-as-bone, \u201cOh, jello shots \u2026 karaoke.\u201d She is constantly trying to deformalise the way she and Serena speak to one another. \u201cWe\u2019re on the same side,\u201d her every word and action seem to be saying. That scene by the pool where the pair sit and smoke together \u2013 a pipe of peace with a filter tip \u2013 offers the greatest hope yet that Serena is turning to the light. Later, she tells June where Hannah may be attending school and the times she could possibly see her in the playground. She seems to be offering active cooperation. But could she be a revolutionary? Do her ambitions extend beyond her own freedoms? After Lydia\u2019s eruption and subsequent humiliation, the party is over and everyone looks at the floor, but the tension is cut by the arrival of Guardians looking for Fred. They have video of a Canadian protest in which Luke can be seen with baby Nicole in a sling, smiling at the camera. June tearfully confirms that it\u2019s her husband. Serena sobs at the sight of Nicole. Surely this is the end for June? She\u2019ll be implicated in the baby\u2019s abduction now for certain. Has Luke\u2019s carelessness damned her? I can\u2019t work out if she looks happy or relieved that her suffering will soon be over. The sound of music Alison Krauss\u2019s Down to the River to Pray plays out the episode as Nicole is baptised by a Canadian priest and June\u2019s fate remains uncertain. Blessed be the fruit. May the lord open. Under his eye Lydia trundling along on a mobility scooter raised a smirk. \u201cHell on wheels,\u201d says June\u2019s friend as they walk. \u201cHe\u2019s cute,\u201d June says to her pious shopping partner, while she\u2019s gazing at her son in the arms of one of the wives. Clever to try to get her on side. But she is not budging. Yet. So the scene is set for the world\u2019s slowest revolution. With someone on the inside, June is well placed to start using the regime\u2019s secrets against them. But her focus will be split because of her desperation to see Hannah."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
