My maths handbook in school'", "bodyText": "The funniest standup I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 You either love him or hate him, but the Adam Sandler comedy special on Netflix is hilarious. It has made me want to push the boundaries of traditional standup a bit more. The funniest book I\u2019ve ever read \u2026 My maths handbook in school. All I could really do was laugh. The funniest TV show I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 The Afrikaans channels in South Africa do reality TV very well. I once watched an Afrikaans version of Come Dine With Me and nearly died from laughter. The funniest film I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 I probably quote Anchorman on a daily basis. The funniest person I know \u2026 It has to be my mother. Not as in the way a comedian is funny. More like a super cringe \u201cposting photos of her garden on Facebook\u201d kind of funny. The funniest heckle I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 Once a dog barked at me during my set. The funniest item of clothing I\u2019ve ever owned \u2026 Everyone always laughs when I wear a Speedo, but I don\u2019t find it funny at all. I think I look great. The funniest hairstyle I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 I played a villain in a Shakespeare play and had to shave the sides and leave a little patch at the top. As if my moustache doesn\u2019t make me look creepy enough. The funniest dream I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 I mostly have anxiety-filled nightmares, so trying to pick the funniest one would be like picking the funniest of all the scary clowns. The funniest thing that shouldn\u2019t be funny \u2026 A dog with sunglasses on. Why is it funny? It shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s just a dog with sunglasses on. Yet it\u2019s hilarious. The funniest number \u2026 8888888. The funniest word \u2026 Brexit. For Schalk Bezuidenhout\u2019s future live dates, visit schalkbezuidenhout.com.
