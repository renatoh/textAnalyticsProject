The England international has endured a frustrating start to a campaign that carried high expectation after last season\u2019s development into a World Cup player with three months spent on the sidelines due to a knee injury. Barkley is yet to recapture last season\u2019s form since his recovery and his occasionally wayward passing prompted a furious outburst from the England manager, Roy Hodgson, towards the end of last month\u2019s friendly win over Scotland. Barkley\u2019s last goal was on 3 May against Manchester City, Everton\u2019s opponents on Saturday and a club who have made no secret of their admiration for the Liverpool-born talent. Mart\u00ednez, however, who denies the Premier League champions made an approach for Barkley in the summer, says the midfielder remains on course to fulfil his undoubted potential. \u201cI think he has improved massively,\u201d said the Everton manager, whose side received fierce criticism after Wednesday\u2019s home draw against Hull City. \u201cIt is unfair to look at Ross\u2019s performances and blame our results on that. Ross is developing all the time. His pass to S\u00e9amus Coleman against Spurs shows the ability he is bringing into his game and he showed incredible power the other night against Hull. I am very pleased with his performances. I don\u2019t think he is performing badly at all. \u201cCan he improve? Of course he can because he is a young man who has all the potential in the world. I see massive improvement in certain areas from where he was last season and I think we are going to see the best Ross Barkley in the second half of the season. Pre-season, before the injury, Ross was at his very best. Injury set him back and it stops you from getting the rhythm but after Christmas we are clearly going to see the best of Ross.\u201d Mart\u00ednez has deployed Barkley across Everton\u2019s front line since his return from injury and admits the 21-year-old has attracted extra attention from opposing teams following last season\u2019s breakthrough campaign. The Everton manager added: \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that Ross is not an unknown any more. When opponents play against him they are making sure it is difficult for him. He has to deal with that but the good thing is that means other players will have the space. You get the benefit as a team. \u201cSometimes when you are assessing an individual\u2019s form you need to consider what the opposition are doing to try to stop them.\u201d Barkley signed a new four-year contract with his boyhood club in the summer but City continue to be linked with the powerful midfielder. Asked if the champions registered their interest in Barkley this summer, Mart\u00ednez replied: \u201cNo, no, no. We have a great relationship with City. We signed Gareth Barry on loan from them and the relationship has always been good but there has never been an approach about Ross. Never. Maybe it would be an issue if you are a selling club but we are not a selling club.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
