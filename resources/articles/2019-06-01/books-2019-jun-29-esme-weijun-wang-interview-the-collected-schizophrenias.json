Her first novel, The Border of Paradise (2016), explored mental illness, family and migration. Wang was named a best young American novelist by Granta (2017) and is the recipient of a Whiting award (2018). She was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in 2013 and late-stage Lyme disease in 2015. Her New York Times-bestselling essay collection, The Collected Schizophrenias, which steps both inside and outside of her condition to bring it to light, has just been published. It won the Graywolf nonfiction prize. Why did you decide to write The Collected Schizophrenias? I had never planned to write a nonfiction book \u2013 I have an MFA in fiction. I was waiting around to see if my first novel would ever sell and I was experiencing a severe episode of psychosis. As a way of coping, I was writing about it, which became the essay Perdition Days. After that episode was over, I polished the essay and ended up finding a home for it on the Toast website [in 2014]. It became rather popular and I received a lot of emails and kind comments. I began to write more essays. That snowballed into what is now this book. You write: \u201cI\u2019ve inherited a love of writing and a talent for the visual arts from my mother, as well as her long and tapered fingers; I\u2019ve also inherited a tendency for madness.\u201d Could you tell me more about that inheritance of mental illness? In the beginning, I didn\u2019t know that there was any mental illness in my family tree. I didn\u2019t know about my mother\u2019s mental illness. I didn\u2019t know about my great-aunt who had died in a mental institution. I didn\u2019t know about my mother\u2019s cousin who had killed himself. There was all this family secrecy around mental illness. A lot of that has to do with cultural stuff \u2013 this idea of saving face and not wanting to be open about these things that are not considered appropriate to talk about or that might bring shame upon the family. As I was getting diagnosed, I learned more about what was in my bloodline. What are your memories of growing up in the midwest? I grew up in a small town that was mostly white and my parents were immigrants dealing with their own stuff, trying to live in this new country. I remember being called racial slurs by other little kids in elementary school, and being confused and embarrassed by my parents who had different accents. I feel so bad about that now. There were things about growing up in a mostly white community and the strain that put on my parents that affected my brother and me. One time in public, this woman was yelling at my mother to take us kids and go back to her own country. In the book, you explore the relationship between creativity and mental health. Why do you feel it\u2019s important not to glamorise it? I do want to be careful not to glamorise mental illness when it comes to creativity because more often than not it actually tends to inhibit creativity. I wrote Perdition Days when experiencing psychosis, but that was a fluke. It\u2019s more normal for me not to be able to function, let alone write, when I am very ill. I want to emphasise and never lose sight of how much suffering is involved. The essays viscerally evoke your experiences, for example, your first hallucination\u2026 I was in my senior year at Stanford. Hallucinations kidnap the senses. When I was in the shower and heard the voice saying: \u201cI hate you\u201d, I was so sure I heard it that I started coming up with all kinds of explanations; could it be coming from the pipes or drain or showerhead? That kicked off a whole period of hallucinations on and off for many years. You write powerfully about Cotard\u2019s syndrome, which makes people believe they have already died\u2026 It was incredibly difficult \u2013 there were times I felt I could pretend things were OK and I was in this afterlife, but for the most part it was awful. There were times when I could not stand to be conscious. I would get through every five seconds \u2013 I\u2019d think five seconds, the next five\u2026 it was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve gotten through. Was it challenging to write the book? It was as traumatising as writing a memoir in many ways. I talked to friends who\u2019ve written memoirs, including Blair Braverman, who wrote Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube, because I was having such a hard time. I\u2019d have to go through thousands of pages of journal entries and remember and relive awful things. It was helpful to be reassured that it wasn\u2019t strange to find it so hard to write, that it was quite common to be retraumatised by writing about things that had happened. Is it true you listen to music while writing? I listened to Ultraviolence by Lana del Rey when writing The Collected Schizophrenias \u2013 I must confess that I was secretly hoping the book would get to her somehow and she might find out that I\u2019ve acknowledged her. What kind of reader were you as a child? A very idiosyncratic reader. I would go to the library and grab whatever was interesting. There\u2019s a book which made a big impact on me \u2013 Turn Not Pale, Beloved Snail, a book about writing meant for younger people. I loved it. I knew from a very young age that I wanted to be a writer, so I would re-read and re-read it. When I was about six I wrote a letter to Little, Brown and they wrote back saying I needed to get an agent, which was very nice of them. I loved Roald Dahl. I would read his books out loud into a cassette recorder. I loved [Frances Hodgson Burnett\u2019s] The Secret Garden. Writing from a young age really came from loving books, and loving books was a way of learning about the world around me. You mention other books exploring mental illness \u2013 what for you was the most powerful? One book that was really important while I was writing The Collected Schizophrenias was Andrew Solomon\u2019s The Noonday Demon. I used it as kind of a lighthouse. I found it so captivating. What books are on your bedside table? Light Years by James Salter. Mostly Dead Things by Kristen Arnett is wonderful. I\u2019ve been rereading The Price of Salt [AKA Carol] by Patricia Highsmith and Fates and Furies by Lauren Groff. I get sent a lot of books to blurb. One, published next year, is Real Life by Brandon Taylor \u2013 it\u2019s phenomenal. I have piles of books everywhere. We\u2019ve run out of space for more bookshelves. Which writers do you most admire? Marilynne Robinson \u2013 she\u2019s absolutely brilliant. Also Toni Morrison. When I won a Whiting award, she was supposed to give a speech at the ceremony but she couldn\u2019t make it because of a storm. I was so disappointed but also mildly relieved as I admire her so much that I knew I\u2019d not be able to say anything intelligent if I met her. What classic novel did you read recently for the first time? Rebecca \u2013 and I was delighted. \u2022 The Collected Schizophrenias by Esm\u00e9 Weijun Wang is published by Penguin (\u00a39.99).
