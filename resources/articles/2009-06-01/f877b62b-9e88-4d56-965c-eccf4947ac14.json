The great one, however, came up with the lame excuse that he could not watch his beloved Reds collapse in the face of a Catalonian command performance because he was jumping between Cannes and Paris to promote his new movie. With no less sincerity I had to explain to the world's media that a trip to Monte Carlo to watch Button press all the right things was similarly a legitimate reason as to why I was not at the Stadium of Light to witness my beloveds' brave attempt to snatch last-minute relegation from the jaws of safety. OK, so only the Shields Gazette was interested in where I was going to be on the big day but, if your team are going down to a set of freak results which would inevitably involve your biggest rivals staying up, then Monte Carlo seems a good place to watch it. Without sounding too Cantonesque, the snag was always going to be getting off the sardine catcher we were berthed on and finding a football-friendly pub in time for kick-off. As luck would have it we had Sir Steve Redgrave in tow so that was never going to be a hindrance. The small tender to take us ashore was reassuringly equipped with oars but were thankfully obsolete as we chugged up to the Ship and Castle, which doubles as Jenson Button's dad's local. Apparently at that time he was not as interested in Aston Villa versus Newcastle as the rest of us. The echoes of his son's racing machine were still reverberating around the principality's walls but attention had turned elsewhere. Redgrave, like other multi-Olympic champions, is a Chelsea fan. Despite our combined selfish interest, we could not persuade the person in charge of the remote to see Sunderland and Chelsea as the main feature. So it was that the assembled ex-pat Geordie fans had to endure their team's spluttering Premier League demise in our less than sympathetic presence. Phil Brown will be delighted to know that even in the playboy's playground there was at least one Hull supporter; to be honest, he did not seem too au fait with the team's members but then who is? There were no late twists and turns as we had been promised, just four teams losing as expected and a slight hint of embarrassment at the scenes of jubilation after the final whistle at Sunderland. The banners unfurled and the posters held high. All made references to the black and whites. It still means too much to all of the north-east teams that their rivals are just a little worse off than they are. It is the lowest level of ambition. For Sunderland it was a season of huge expectations and spectacular underachievement. Thankfully for all concerned it did not end in relegation and by comparison with what went on up the road at St James' it was almost a successful year. Nonetheless this end-of-season drama is one in which I would rather see others playing the lead role. It looked as though it might be a thing of the past after the arrival of Roy Keane and the Irish contingent but it is never so simple with Sunderland and so here we go again with new resolve. As someone once said, it is the hope that hurts. It appears as though the man to take away our pain is going to be Brucie. It should be a popular appointment with the fans if only for entertainment value. If there are not a few renditions of 'points mean prizes', I will eat a black cat. Is it too much to hope that, with the financial backing of Ellis Short, the good stewardship of Niall Quinn and a north-easterner born and bred at the helm, I can look at the last game of next season without trepidation? With regard to Eric, I had one poster of Debbie Harry on my wall. I wonder if he fancies making a sequel. It is possible, though, that I may have to give Cannes a miss next year. There could be football to watch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
