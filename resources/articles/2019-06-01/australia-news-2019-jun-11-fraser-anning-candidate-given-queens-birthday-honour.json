Adrian Cheok was made a member of the Order of Australia for \u201csignificant service to international education\u201d. Cheok initially joined the Palmer United party but quit to join Fraser Anning\u2019s Conservative National party after he was told to \u201cdumb down\u201d his policies. At May\u2019s federal election Cheok attracted 868 votes in the lower house seat of Boothby in South Australia. Last year Anning was widely condemned for invoking the \u201cfinal solution\u201d in his maiden speech to parliament, in which he called for a plebiscite on ending immigration by Muslims and non-English speaking people \u201cfrom the third world\u201d. In Jaunuary he used taxpayers\u2019 money to attend a rally involving far-right extremists and filmed a video alongside its leaders, the convicted criminals Blair Cottrell and Neil Erikson. Anning also blamed Muslim migrants for the New Zealand terrorist attack in which a white supremacist killed 50 worshippers at two mosques. Cheok has posted some controversial material on social media, including a picture of Labor\u2019s Senate leader, Penny Wong, with opposition leader Anthony Albanese and deputy leader Richard Marles captioned: \u201cTwo-and-a-half men.\u201d He has also reposted a picture of a woman in a burqa casting a vote which says: \u201cWho or what is voting for what or whom?\u201d According to his website, Cheok is a professor at i-University Tokyo, a visiting professor at Raffles University in Malaysia, and the University of Novi Sad in Serbia. He was part of a team that invented a remote kissing gadget, called the Kissenger, which transmits the sensation of kissing between mobile phones. The artificial intelligence expert also heads the international Love and Sex with Robots conference. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be so much easier, so much more convenient to have sex with a robot. You can have exactly what kind of sex you want. That\u2019s going to be the future,\u201d he told News Corp in 2016. \u201cActual sex with humans may be like going to a concert. When you\u2019re at home you can listen to Beethoven\u2019s ninth symphony, it\u2019s good enough and once or twice a year you\u2019ll want to go the Royal Albert Hall and hear it in a concert hall.\u201d Comment has been sought from Cheok and the Australian Honours Secretariat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
