She is now 14 weeks pregnant after going to a Barcelona clinic for an egg from a donor who, under Spanish law, will remain anonymous. It cost her and her husband \u20ac8,000 (\u00a35,500). \"Our first choice would have been to have egg donation in this country. We've been on the list for two-and-a-half years now and I still don't expect to hear from them for a while. We actually had someone who was considering donating an egg on our behalf but she was certainly put off by the change in the law,\" said Rachel (not her real name). \"I found out about it after the consultant here recommended a Chinese herbalist. It was the herbalist who told us about the Spanish clinic. Now my consultant is gathering a list of clinics from New York to Marbella. \"We went in October to see them and had the treatment in February. We had three or four days in Barcelona and then went home. We were treated so well in Spain. It was such a pleasant experience. It is a lot easier than IVF, which I have had before and was awful. \"They gave us two eggs. We lost one of them after six weeks but the other one is doing very nicely. We are now in week 14 and it is jolly exciting. The clinic is in frequent contact by email, which is very reassuring. They try to get the best physical match they can. They said our donor had pale, northern skin and was of a similar height and hair colour to me. \"My husband would rather there was anonymity about the donor. I don't mind that much. But I know this is something that has a huge influence on women who want to donate. \"I would really like to say something abut the donors. It is a huge, huge thing that they do. People like me are so grateful. We had no other choice apart from adoption or remaining childless. I am so sorry the law has changed here and it has put so many women off. We are lucky. We can afford to do this.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
