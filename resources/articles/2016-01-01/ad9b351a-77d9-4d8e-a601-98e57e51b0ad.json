While the most famous comes from the British TV show Top of the Pops \u2013 when he casually put his arm around his guitarist Mick Ronson in a homoerotic display that caused jaws to hit the floor the length of Britain, Bowie did plenty to shock and awe Americans too. Here are some of the most famous. Soul Train, performing Fame and Golden Years, 1975 With nicotine hair, a snow-white tan and cheekbones as hollow as the stardom he\u2019s singing about, Bowie looks profoundly weird shimmying on a podium in the middle of the music show Soul Train\u2019s famous dancers. He\u2019s also, it\u2019s safe to say, less than sober. He\u2019s miming, but it doesn\u2019t matter. The song sounds savagely vital, and Bowie is coolness personified. Bing Crosby\u2019s Merrie Old Christmas, performing Little Drummer Boy/Peace on Earth, 1977 It\u2019s hard to imagine a greater creative gear-change from being coked up on Soul Train to performing carols with Bing Crosby on his Christmas special, but change was the modus operandi of Bowie\u2019s entire career, and his chops as an old-fashioned crooner were an integral part of his persona. Despite the cosy surroundings, Bowie still looks and sounds otherworldly, and the blend of his voice and Bing\u2019s is beautiful. Saturday Night Live, performing The Man Who Sold the World, TVC15 and Boys Keep Swinging, 1979 Bowie had cleaned up and moved to Berlin but returned to New York to perform on SNL. Always alert to stirrings in pop culture\u2019s avant garde, he brought with him Joey Arias and Klaus Nomi, both leading lights of downtown New York\u2019s performance art scene. During TVC15 the pair drag around a toy poodle while Bowie wears a skirt; Boys Keep Swinging is performed with Bowie in a giant marionette costume. It\u2019s spectacular and subversive. The Tonight Show, performing Life on Mars? and Ashes to Ashes, 1980 Promoting his appearance on Broadway in The Elephant Man, together with his new album Scary Monsters, an almost natural-looking Bowie in a red bomber jacket and blue pegged trousers nevertheless brings the house down with a stratospheric version of Life on Mars? It\u2019s a measure of his confidence that he immediately launches into what was then new material \u2013 Ashes to Ashes, which revisited Major Tom and returned him to the top of the charts, in the UK at least. The Concert for New York City, performing America, 2001 A month after 9/11, Bowie opened the concert at Madison Square Garden organised by Paul McCartney in response to the attacks with a version of Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s America. Played on a small keyboard, but sung with operatic passion, its chorus \u201cWe\u2019ve all come to look for America\u201d is an incredibly moving expression of his relationship with the nation, his adopted home."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
