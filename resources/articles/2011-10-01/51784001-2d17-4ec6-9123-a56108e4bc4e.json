Warren, who promotes both men, added that it was a shame there should be a loser. But the Liverpool Echo Arena did get the right victor by the evening's close, and next up for the Welshman may be a show-stopping meeting with Bernard Hopkins at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in February, which Joe Calzaghe, who beat the American three years ago, believes he would win. If Cleverly walks into the ring against the 46-year-old Hopkins \u2013 a genuine warrior \u2013 he should, indeed, have no concern. Cleverly departed Bellew's home turf having bested a match that began as a grudge but closed with each man smiling, apparently friends. Cleverly's decision over the Liverpudlian read 114-114, 116-113, 117-112. But the judges should have given the count to the Welshman unanimously, while Bellew did not deserve the wide deficit on his two losing cards. Bellew came to bang, and he did throughout. But so did Cleverly. Bellew's taunt had been that the impressive 24-year-old was a pugilist possessing only the single note of counter-attack, and the hostility between them had caused bitter words and a near scrap pre-bout when this contest was nearly staged in May. This was all forgotten after Cleverly had continually walked forward with zeal and intent at Bellew, who was made to discard his scorn and who said: \"I take my hat off to him. He throws lots of punches and hits you with a lot of shots and they come from different angles. He's a good champion and well done to him. I've got lots of respect [for him].\" Cleverly said: \"Deep down I was enjoying it, slugging it out and putting on a display.\" Hopkins became the oldest ever world champion when beating Jean Pascal to take the WBC and IBO light-heavyweight belts in Montreal in May. But in the early hours of Sunday he lost the WBC title to Chad Dawson following a disputed second round TKO, having relinquished the IBO crown for not paying the sanctioning fee. Dawson lifted Hopkins up out of a clinch with his shoulder causing him to land awkwardly and hurt his left shoulder, and he was unable to continue. After the referee ruled that this was not a foul but a knockdown, Dawson won and Warren said: \"Hopkins's loss was controversial so I'm still keen to make the fight and what a fight that would be for the Millennium Stadium next year.\" Cleverly is keen to take the bout or meet the WBA champion, Beibut Shumenov, a 28-year-old Kazakhstani, whose record stands at 12 wins and a loss. He said: \"[Joe] Calzaghe told me myself I could beat Hopkins because he won't like my style and Joe has been in the ring with him so he knows. I've got the style to beat Hopkins and it's a fight that could happen next, if not [it will be] Shumenov for the WBA title.\" James DeGale returned from losing his British super-middleweight title and undefeated record to George Groves last time out in May to become the European champion with a 12-round, split decision win over Piotr Wilczewski, scored 114-114, 113-115, 113-115. DeGale, who was stunned in the fifth round and who should fight again as soon as December, said: \"I'm pleased with it and I had to dig deep. \"Sometimes I make things a bit hard for myself and maybe I was a bit lazy. I was a bit eager to impress and all the doubters were there. I was a bit nervous early on but I'm European champion.\" Warren wants him to have a world title shot, possibly next year. He added: \"Hopefully with a couple more fights and a bit more experience we can get him a world title fight.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
