Coastal communities across the north-east of England and the west of Scotland are most at risk from gales, where exposed areas could experience gusts of 70-75mph, according to the Met Office, which issued yellow weather warnings for the two regions. Inland winds are set to reach 50-60mph, with bus and train services likely to be delayed. Loss of power and other services is possible, but cuts are hoped to be short-term. Meanwhile, flood warnings are in place across the south-west of England. Parts of Hampshire, West Sussex and Brighton and Hove are expected to have local groundwater flooding over the coming days, damaging homes, land and property. The Environment Agency has advised that immediate action is required, and urged residents to turn off gas, water and electricity and move their belongings, family and pets out of reach of rising floodwater. A further 26 flood alerts have been issued in areas including Salisbury and Dorset, with the Agency urging residents to be prepared, including readying a bag with medicines and insurance documents. The Met Office has recommended that residents in the north-east of England and west of Scotland drive only if it is strictly necessary and stay indoors as much as possible when the gales hit. Residents are also advised to park their cars away from trees, securely lock doors and windows, and secure loose garden objects which could be blown into windows. A spokesperson for the Met Office said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be windy over the next few days, with strong winds to come tomorrow and another spell on Tuesday. We encourage people to keep checking the forecast, and follow Met Office advice on staying safe in windy conditions.\u201d Wind speeds are set to fall on Wednesday, but weather will remain unsettled across the UK until Friday, with outbursts of rain expected. The warnings come just two months after floods swept across Yorkshire and the Midlands and parts of England experienced more than a month\u2019s worth of rain in 24 hours. Almost 120 flood alerts were issued in early November, with flooding causing widespread evacuations and leading to the death of the former high sheriff of Derbyshire, Annie Hall, who drowned after being swept away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
