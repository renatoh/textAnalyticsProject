As the person who organised the only debate on the subject in the House of Lords, I have started legal action against the police for failing to have a regulatory framework for its use. It\u2019s shocking that we are allowing the police and companies to set the rules as we abolish privacy in public spaces, because ministers are failing to act. The difference between ourselves and the likes of China and Russia is that we have a fairly open democracy, but this is no defence against state oppression and commercial exploitation if politicians fail to recognise that when our face becomes an identity card, all the rules change.
