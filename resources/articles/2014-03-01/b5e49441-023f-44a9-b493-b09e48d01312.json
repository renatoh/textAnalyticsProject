The Whitehall saboteurs who keep people out of work", "bodyText": "\u2022 Justice minister Chris Grayling has much to say about crime and punishment and rehabilitation. We must get the errant back into society, he says. But as is so often the case, one arm of government doesn't know what the other is doing. So while the Ministry of Justice has been talking about getting those convicted back into work, the Home Office has been ensuring they stay jobless. The Disclosure and Barring Service, born of the merged Criminal Records Bureau and the Independent Safeguarding Authority, wasn't able or didn't bother to keep track of the changes to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act of last year. Thus we learn that in forms supplied to employers for completion by potential employees, they have been requiring those with minor and historic convictions to declare them, when the law says they don't have to. Having done so, job seekers have had offers of employment withdrawn. A disaster for them, and as a consequence the DBS will this week have its knuckles rapped by the information commissioner's office. A bit of compo for those thus blighted might be nice. \u2022 Much anticipation ahead of the launch for An Unexpected MP, the memoir of Westminster life as seen by barrister and ex-Tory MP Jerry Hayes. Much of the material \u2013 tales of Margaret Thatcher's mood swings, and so on \u2013 was aired during serialisation in the Daily Mail. But the editing process inevitably meant some of Hayes's recollections were not shared with readers. One concerns the paper's star columnist, Richard Littlejohn. He and Hayes broadcast together on the talk radio station LBC. \"We took an instant dislike to each other,\" writes Hayes. \"I think he saw me as a cocky little clever dick. I saw him as an arrogant bully with a brain the size of a pea. I didn't last more than a few weeks before he booted me out.\" Littlejohn was not much loved by staff, writes Hayes. \"His driver, a tough little Scot, became thoroughly fed up with his boorish behaviour after a drink. He once had to pick Littlejohn up after a session in the pub when he was at his most irritating, needling the poor guy mercilessly. This was unwise, as the driver did a little bit of debt-collecting on the side \u2013 and was not afraid to give a stern warning that if he kept it up, he would lamp him.\" There was no need. \"Littlejohn just passed out.\" \u2022 More brickbats hurled at the BBC's creative director and perpetual target, Alan Yentob. He does seem to attract hostility. Witness this account from presenter Liz Kershaw in her new autobiography, The Bird and The Beeb. \"During the first Gulf War, I was sitting in reception when six-figure-salaried Alan 'What's He For Exactly?' Yentob tried to breeze in.\" He encountered Radio 1's no-nonsense receptionist, who asked for his ID. He didn't have it, but moved to enter anyway. \"I'm sorry \u2013 I don't know you from Adam,\" barked the receptionist. \"For all I know, you could be a Shi'ite separatist.\" Kershaw recalls that \"Yentob did his own 'Desert Storm' from the building\". \u2022 Almost as many brickbats fired at our own Baroness Ashton, the EU high representative for foreign affairs. Observers seem to be diehard fans or inveterate critics. And, for all her good work over Iran and more recently Ukraine, there is energetic plotting in Paris and Berlin to have her replaced. French periodical Le Canard Enchain\u00e9 quotes an official of the BND (Germany's version of MI6) calling her \"catastrophic\". Meanwhile, the news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur has Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany's foreign minister, \"reproaching Cathy Ashton \u2026 for an incapacity to understand Kremlin reactions on matters to do with their sphere of interest \u2026 and to think politically\". Another thwack in the Journal de Dimanche. She does well to survive each day. \u2022 Finally, a good time was promised to those attracted by a Lib Dem fundraiser on Wednesday. Just one puzzle: can the musically inclined member for Lewes reasonably be billed as \"Home Office minister and pop star Norman Baker MP\"? Has he secretly joined One Direction? With a Lib Dem in tow, might they relaunch as All Directions. In any event, we should be told. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
