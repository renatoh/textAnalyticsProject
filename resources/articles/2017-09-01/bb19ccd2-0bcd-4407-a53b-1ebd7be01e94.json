The victim, named locally as Dr Nasser Kurdy, an orthopaedic surgeon and imam, was reportedly arriving at the Altrincham Islamic centre, Grove Lane, for evening prayers at 6pm when someone stabbed him in the neck from behind. A friend of the victim told the Manchester Evening News that he had suffered a non-critical 3cm stab wound which required stitches. \u201cHe is a lovely guy, very gentle, loved by the community, Muslim and non-Muslim alike,\u201d said the friend. \u201cHe needs stitches and will be kept in hospital overnight. He is incredibly lucky. This incident has really shaken us.\u201d Harun Khan, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: \u201cWe are shocked to hear of the stabbing of a prominent Muslim surgeon outside Altrincham mosque today in what the Greater Manchester police have described as a hate crime. \u201cWe are relieved to hear that the victim\u2019s injuries are not currently critical. Our prayers are with the victim, his family and the local community.\u201d He added he hoped the prime minister and home secretary would implement the government\u2019s hate crime action plan. Another witness told the Manchester Evening News that nothing like this had ever happened before and it did not reflect the community. \u201cIn my experience community relations are very good and it is a very safe area. It is shocking for all of us,\u201d they said. \u201cMy message to the congregation is to not be deterred from coming here. One thing that our scripture tells us is to repel evil with kindness.\u201d Andrew Western, a local councillor, tweeted: \u201cShocked and saddened to hear of stabbing of Dr Nasser Kurdy outside Altrincham mosque. Thoughts with him and his family.\u201d A video posted on Facebook purportedly shows the victim immediately after the attack. A man is filmed sitting on a bench clutching at his neck and appears to be in some pain as people attend to him. The footage shows them asking him about his attacker. At first he appears unable to answer and another person is overheard saying he was \u201chit\u201d by something in a man\u2019s hand: \u201cI don\u2019t think it was that sharp.\u201d Manchester Central mosque said on Facebook the victim was a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Wythenshawe hospital, and occasionally delivered the sermon at Friday prayers. The mosque said: \u201cExtremely sad to hear about the dreadful news that has just come in from Altrincham where an imam has been stabbed in the neck.\u201d Police said they were treating the attack as a hate crime and confirmed they had arrested two men, aged 54 and 32. \u201cThanks to the quick response from our colleagues in the ambulance service, [the victim] is currently receiving treatment for his injuries,\u201d said a spokesperson for Greater Manchester police. \u201cHe was attacked in broad daylight as he made his way to the mosque. While we are yet to gather all the evidence, we can be sure that there is no place for hate crime on our streets. We will do all that we can to take action against those who jeopardise the safety of others. \u201cWe have two people in custody who were arrested a short time after the call came in but need people who witnessed the attack or those who have information to contact us.\u201d Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson added: \u201cThis is a very nasty and unprovoked attack against a much-loved local man. Police are not looking for any other suspects.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
