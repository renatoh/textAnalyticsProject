The latest instalment is one of the most successful so far, even if it doesn't quite compete with the finest on record. Zinman scores particularly highly in the first two movements of the Fifth, keeping the opening funeral march on a tight rein, with wonderfully secure trumpet solos, and finding real profundity in its elegiac moments, just as he invests the great chorale in the explosive movement that follows with genuine grandeur (though it's a bit alarming that the sleeve notes and track listings wrongly identify that movement as belonging to the second of the symphony's three parts rather than the first). The rest of the symphony isn't quite on the same level - the central Scherzo a bit undercharacterised, the Adagietto just a fraction too lingering - but the wholeness of Zinman's performance is never in doubt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
