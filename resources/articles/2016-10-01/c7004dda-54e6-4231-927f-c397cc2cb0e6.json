The pair in their 20s were taken into custody only 15 minutes after allegedly pointing the device at a helicopter over Northwood which was supporting colleagues with a search on the ground. The aircraft directed police community support officers who were in the area at the time of the incident \u2013 around 8.50pm \u2013 and were able to track down the men before being joined by police officers. In a statement, Staffordshire police said: \u201cTwo young men in their early 20s have been arrested by police on suspicion of endangering an aircraft this evening. A laser has been recovered and the men will remain in custody and be questioned by police.\u201d In February this year, the National Police Air Service raised concerns about the increasing number of laser \u201cattacks\u201d on aircraft. The director of operations, Ollie Dismore, said: \u201cIn an attack, a laser pointer is deliberately or recklessly shone at airborne aircraft sometimes persistently over a period of minutes. The impact on a pilot is at the very least distracting but can be serious enough to cause temporary \u2018flash\u2019 blindness and in some cases lasting eye damage. \u201cWhat may seem like harmless fun to the culprit could potentially have devastating consequences for the crew and passengers in the aircraft as well as innocent members of the public on the ground. In serious cases, using a laser pointer in this way can carry a prison sentence.\u201d Last year there were 1,800 \u201claser incidents\u201d on aircraft in the UK reported to the Civil Aviation Authority. In August a British Airways flight to Heathrow from Bergen was targeted by a green laser beam as it made its final descent. It was among a string of incidents targeting planes taking off and landing at UK airports, with Heathrow the worst target for the laser pen incidents. Birmingham airport is the second most heavily targeted with one incident a week. Earlier this year a former US navy pilot warned that the increasing number of such attacks could lead to a \u201cterrible tragedy\u201d. Dr Steve Schallhorn urged for more to be done to raise awareness about the irreversible injuries that can be caused by laser pens. In July a pilots\u2019 union called for the lasers to be classified as \u201coffensive weapons\u201d after figures suggested Heathrow\u2019s pilots were targeted 48 times in the first six months of 2015. The National Police Air Service is conducting a laser eyewear protection trial that may allow it to protect its staff against the threat of laser strikes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
