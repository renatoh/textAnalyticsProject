Emap's decision to appeal directly to the shareholders of its Edinburgh-based competitor comes nearly six weeks after it first offered SRH's board \u00a310.40 a share to recommend a bid for the 72% of the company it does not already own. The timing of yesterday's announcement came as a surprise to SRH, which immediately hit back by saying that the offer \"significantly undervalued\" the company. SRH, which has the dominant share of the radio market in Scotland with Radio Firth and Radio Clyde as well as significant assets in Ireland, is understood to believe that a price closer to \u00a312 a share more fully reflects its value. However, the initial reaction from SRH shareholders appeared to back the Emap offer as its shares rose 127.5p, or 15%, to \u00a310, well below the indicative offer price. The weakness of the current advertising climate and doubts regarding a counter-offer - Emap already owns 27.8% of the company - were cited by some analysts for the reaction yesterday. One executive at a rival company said: \"This may not be a knockout blow but it must be the beginning of the end, all the same.\" The much-anticipated bid comes amid expectations that the highly fragmented radio industry will consolidate following changes to the law. Two of the biggest companies in the sector - GWR and Capital - merged to form GCap Media earlier this year. In statements made to the London Stock Exchange yesterday, Emap - which owns Kiss FM and Magic radio stations and Heat magazine - said it was \"disappointed\" by SRH's rejection. Its offer \"fully values SRH, both on the basis of its current performance and its future prospects, as well as crystallising a premium for control.\" SRH's share price, which closed at 872.5p the day before the bid was launched, has not closed at or above \u00a310.40 for almost four years. Emap also warned that it reserved the right to make a hostile bid at a lower price, a highly unusual move for a company that usually seeks recommendations. The target group fought back by publishing financial analysis to justify its rejection. \"SRH has been a consistently strong performer in the radio sector on operational and financial metrics over the last five years and this performance has continued into the current year.\" The Emap bid offered a multiple of just 10 times next year's earnings before interest, tax and amortisation, it claimed, well below the industry average of about 13-14 times. The takeover offer also failed to take account of cost-savings of some \u00a37.5m. The SRH board said it was \"confident about the independent future of the company\". Its defence received some support from analysts and shareholders despite the share price reaction. Malcolm Morgan, a sector analyst at Investec, described a \u00a310.40 bid as a \"bargain, without much of a premium for control\". Richard Hitchcock, an analyst at Numis Securities, said a fair value for SRH would be \u00a311.05. He added that a takeover would be a \"fabulous deal from a strategic point of view\" for Emap. John Hayes, a fund manager with F&amp;C Asset Management, which owns 270,000 shares in SRH, told Dow Jones that the company was right to reject an offer for the group of less than \u00a311.50 per share. With little geographical overlap, a combined group would not have to sell any of its assets. Emap's radio stations tend to be based in English metropolitan areas such as London, Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester and Birmingham, while SRH's base is in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Emap also hopes an acquisition would help it to roll out its biggest brands - Kiss, Magic and Kerrang! - across the UK. Finally, the company wants to expand its digital business in advance of the country switching from the analogue signal, and SRH has a profitable digital business. SRH also owns Score Press newspapers, with more than 40 regional papers in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Industry analysts expect Emap to sell this division for around \u00a3150m. Bid speculation has surrounded Emap and SRH since the former bought its 27% stake from Scottish Media Group for 930p a share in January 2004. In March, it disclosed its interest in buying SRH but said that it \"would not pay a price that runs counter to the interests of Emap's shareholders\". Ralph Bernard, the chairman of GCap Media, welcomed signs of greater consolidation yesterday. \"This is an inevitable move and part of a process of consolidation heralded by a change in the law.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
