Do not read on unless you have watched the fifth episode. If, after the latest episode of The Missing, you can still look in the toolbox and contemplate putting up a picture with that Black and Decker drill, you\u2019re made of stronger stuff than me. Poor sweet German copper Lenhart met an incredibly gruesome end at the hands of corrupt soldier Gettrick. Having deduced that there was a third man involved in the widening child abduction ring, and naively popping round to ask Gettrick about his part in it, young Lenhart ended up coming undone. At Gettrick\u2019s house, he met a little girl we can assume is the child of Gettrick (or Stone Sr) and Sophie Giroux \u2013 if it is indeed Sophie Giroux and not Alice Webster, or the third girl spotted in the rollercoaster pictures. It\u2019s complicated. By sheer coincidence and miraculous timing, the child happened to be awake, and walking downstairs, and to have drawn a picture of herself with her mother \u201cin the basement\u201d, which she happily explained to Lenhart, clicking the story in to place. Unfortunately Gettrick stopped it going any further by doing a bit of DIY on Lenhart\u2019s brain (I assume it was his brain \u2013 I closed my eyes as soon as the drill started to whirr). If you thought the end of the last episode was a shocker \u2013 is that Sophie/Alice having a coffee in Switzerland in the present day? \u2013 this upped the ante. Not since Lisa Faulkner got her head dunked in a vat of boiling oil in the very first episode of Spooks has an on-screen murder seemed so grisly. And there are still three episodes left, and plenty of questions to answer. Will Baptiste crack one last case before he shuffles off this mortal coil? Where is the third girl? Will the Websters learn what happened to their daughter? Is there any chance she could still be alive? What of the framed butcher and his ex-military wife? Could a child reared in a kidnap bunker be any more capable of perfect dramatic timing? And just how much did the army cover up? Doubtless there are more. It\u2019s been so twisty, so good at shattering our expectations, that at times I\u2019ve had to wind back, just to work out who was doing what to whom. Its ambition and boldness in telling a complex story without pandering to the fact that you might need a bit of time to comprehend it all has paid off. Plus it\u2019s a pleasure to watch truly incredible actors performing as if their Bafta depended on it, particularly Tch\u00e9ky Karyo as the Sara Lund-esque Baptiste, and Keeley Hawes as Alice\u2019s mother Gemma, who, after her Line of Duty performance earlier this year, deserves a special award for her contribution to the portrayal of steely yet harrowed women on the BBC. The Missing\u2019s first series, which starred James Nesbitt as the father of an abducted boy, was a huge success for creators the Williams brothers, pulling in almost nine million viewers for the season finale. The latest run shows their schtick is no one-trick-pony. It\u2019s proven to be one of those outstanding BBC dramas that makes all the mega-budgets of huge US shows seem unnecessary. Over multiple countries and languages and time frames, and with just eight lean episodes, this is elegant, bleak television, redolent of peak Scandi-noir thrillers like The Killing and The Bridge. It might not have been pleasant to uncover this frozen world of military cover-ups, murders and child abduction, but it has been gripping from the start. I just dread to think what they\u2019ll do with a spirit level before we get to the end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
