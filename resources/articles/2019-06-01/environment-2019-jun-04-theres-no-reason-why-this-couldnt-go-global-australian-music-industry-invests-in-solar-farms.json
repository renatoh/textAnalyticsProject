But this time she wasn\u2019t just thinking about the money; she was thinking about emissions. Independent bands are used to running on a shoestring budget \u2013 a carbon-conscious Lenffer wanted Cloud Control to run a more environmentally efficient operation, too. She began asking climate scientists in the field, and connected with Dr Chris Dey from Aret\u00e9 Sustainability. Dey crunched the numbers for Cloud Control\u2019s two-week tour, playing 15 clubs and theatres from Byron Bay to Perth. He found that it would produce about 28 tonnes of emissions \u2013 roughly equivalent to what an average household produces in a year. And that was just the national leg of an album tour that would take the band to the US three times. \u201cI had suspected that all of this flying, and all of the energy that goes into tours, can\u2019t be very good for the environment \u2013 but there was no solution that existed beyond carbon offsetting,\u201d Lenffer says. Offsetting is essentially an attempt at equalisation: when you offset your flights, you try to compensate for the carbon by donating to a program to suck it out of the atmosphere, via tree planting or sequestration someplace else. Lenffer wanted to aim higher. Partnering with the superannuation fund Future Super, and the developer Impact Investment Group, Lenffer has established FEAT. (Future Energy Artists): a platform that officially launches on Wednesday and will allow musicians to build and invest in their own solar farms. Early signs are promising. As well as Cloud Control, other Australian bands already signed up include Midnight Oil, Vance Joy, Regurgitator, Big Scary, Peking Duk and Jack River. The first solar farm being built with their help is Brigalow: an 80-hectare project near Pittsworth on Queensland\u2019s Darling Downs. \u201cAt last, a project that takes the great passion many artists have for a healthy world powered by renewable energy, and makes it doable,\u201d says Midnight Oil\u2019s frontman, Peter Garrett. Speaking to Guardian Australia, Paul Curtis, Regurgitator\u2019s manager, talks about an \u201cactively engaged citizenry embracing a more optimistic and progressive approach to the future\u201d. Lenffer wanted to tap into the creative drive of her industry to find a solution to a complex problem. \u201cThe environmental movement often lacks a positive premise for action,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is exciting to own a piece of a solar farm. To do that collectively, we can leave a lasting, tangible infrastructure legacy and say, \u2018We built that together.\u2019\u201d Here\u2019s how it works: money that artists invest in FEAT. is put into a portfolio which is managed by Future Super, and can be used to buy ownership stakes in solar farms or loaned to build their infrastructure. The land that Brigalow solar farm is being built on was previously used as a sorghum grain farm. It is now being leased from the land\u2019s owner to build the solar project, whose progress is closely monitored by Impact Investment Group, which manages the underlying fund investing in Brigalow. And artists can put forward as much as they can afford. Perhaps they want to throw in a one-off lump sum, or offer a percentage of their touring income; the idea is that everyone should be able to invest in their financial and environmental future \u2013 which is why FEAT. set a floor price of just $5 to set up an account. FEAT. says the 34.55-megawatt Brigalow solar farm could power the equivalent of 11,300 homes for 30 years. (Looked at another way, it could generate more than 2,000 Cloud Control tours in renewable energy.) That energy is then sold into the energy market, with a target return on investment for artists of 5% a year. The total emissions output of the global music sector is not well studied. A 2010 investigation into the UK industry found it was responsible for more than 540,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas every year, much of it from live music. Most of that was transport, not just of band members and equipment, but fans: audience travel alone accounted for 43% of emissions. A further 26% came from the lifecycle of CDs, which speaks to the age of the study. But, according to researchers from the University of Glasgow, the streaming age hasn\u2019t made for a cleaner product: the energy required to store and process music in the cloud makes for an even worse carbon footprint than manufacturing and distributing CDs and records. For artists, the pitiful royalty rates generated from streaming, and the crash in sales of physical product, means that live music makes up the bulk of revenue. For Lenffer, going on tour meant contributing to the global climate emergency \u2013 but she was willing to gamble that \u201ca progressive community like the music industry would have the guts and imagination to embrace change\u201d. Lenffer says she was inspired by community movements overseas, particularly in Europe, where groups were banding together to buy investments in renewables. \u201cSporting clubhouses would install solar panels on their rooftops purchased by the residents in the area, [who] would then be paid back through the energy generated over a period of time,\u201d she explains. \u201cI found about 70 groups in Australia doing it, as opposed to around 500 in Scotland and 1000 in Germany.\u201d But as well as being the biggest greenhouse gas emitters per capita, Australians also have the highest take-up of rooftop solar. Lenffer says this statistic \u201cshows that people are driving the change where our government is not\u201d. And, compared with Europe, there are far more abundant solar resources available in our sunburnt country. Lenffer sees the potential for her idea to catch on. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why this couldn\u2019t go global,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we can demonstrate it works here \u2013 which I feel like we can, because we\u2019ve already got a number of big-name and emerging artists signed up \u2013 if we can take ownership over building the solar assets that are going to power our future, which we need to do as quickly as possible, there\u2019s no reason why this couldn\u2019t be rolled out for every artist touring the world.\u201d \u2022 Read more about FEAT."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
