At Asia Pacific Report, the decision was \u201ca bolt out of the blue\u201d. The former Labour leader David Cunliffe worked alongside Mahuta for almost 20 years. He says she has a rare record of honesty, and has studiously avoided the ego-driven politicking of the Beehive, as New Zealand\u2019s parliament is known. \u201cI think it was an inspired choice, I have worked closely with Nanaia over the years and I think she is a person of good judgment, hard work and great strength,\u201d Cunliffe says. \u201cShe is deeply rooted in very positive, humane values, so I think she will bring that perspective to international relations. By her own whakapapa (ancestry) she is of royal lineage within the M\u0101ori world and that will help her take a long-term perspective. She\u2019s very grounded in who she is and she\u2019s very strong.\u201d Trail blazer Mahuta, 50, has been in parliament for 24 years. She has held portfolios including trade, customs, M\u0101ori affairs and youth development. Despite her long service and diverse experience, Mahuta has kept a low-profile, avoiding the limelight and dodging any association with scandal or gossip: \u201cI\u2019ve learnt what to worry about and what not to worry about \u2013 I don\u2019t want to be distracted,\u201d she says. Nevertheless, she has set a series of firsts. In 2016 she became the first woman to display a moko kauae (sacred facial tattoo) in parliament. Now she becomes New Zealand\u2019s first female foreign minister, and only the second M\u0101ori person in the role. \u201cIt\u2019s satisfying to be given the opportunity to serve in a way we can lift the glass ceiling, in offices that have often not been open to women,\u201d Mahuta says. \u201cAnd importantly blaze a trail that can be different and unique, and carve out a real sense of opportunity as a country, but also for Indigenous people ... So that\u2019s what I am going to do.\u201d Her tribe, Waikato-Tainui, says she \u201cbrings tremendous mana [power] and skills\u201d to her new role. \u201cNanaia has the negotiation and diplomacy skills to represent Aotearoa on the global stage. She also brings a unique cultural perspective that\u2019s especially relevant in these times of great geopolitical uncertainty,\u201d a tribe spokesperson said in a statement. It is this very uncertainty that influenced Ardern\u2019s choice, Mahuta says. \u201cShe, we, have acknowledged that these are really challenging and uncertain times with the global pandemic but also ways in which countries are responding and the impact on economies,\u201d she says, citing the climate emergency, growing inequality, and loss of trust in democratic institutions and multinationals as pressing concerns. \u201cWe are navigating unprecedented times. We\u2019re realistic about the size of our country and the level of our influence, but we have always maintained our ability to take a values-based approach following the leadership of \u2026 Ardern.\u201d These values include manaakitanga (looking after people), collaboration, kaitiakitanga (guardianship of the environment) and relationship-building. \u201cWe will not be deterred by some of those big challenging issues like climate change, we will actually lean into that space. And do our bit to ensure that we can lead on some really difficult fronts and build a coalition of the willing.\u201d Family diplomacy Mahuta has two children, aged 10 and 7, as well as a third \u201cspirit\u201d [lost] child. She says her background as \u201ca mother, as a daughter, a sister, a woman\u201d gives her an intergenerational grounding, which emphasises the importance of building strong relationships and community. \u201cVery early on in life I gained the skills of diplomacy primarily through my upbringing and the range of experiences I was exposed to, but most importantly understanding who I am as a M\u0101ori woman. \u201cOnce you understand who you are, you are less intimidated by other people from other backgrounds and beliefs. And so you navigate your way through to ensure you\u2019re trying to achieve an outcome in a way that recognises diversity is not a threat. And that if you want to build a more sustainable future or outcome you have to build consensus. I learnt those skills from a young age from my family and community.\u201d Mahuta says hints about how she will manage the high-profile foreign affairs portfolio can be seen in her \u201cflax-roots\u201d or grassroots politics. How she has handled community affairs is how she will manage international relations, she says. M\u0101ori activist Tina Ngata says it is \u201cwell overdue that we have a w\u0101hine M\u0101ori step into this role\u201d. \u201cHaving someone with the connections and commitment to Te Ao M\u0101ori comes with an expectation that we will no longer be left behind in these discussions.\u201d As a tribal member of Waikato-Tainui, Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto and Ng\u0101ti Manu, Mahuta has familial ties to the M\u0101ori king, and from a young age assisted her father, Sir Robert Mahuta, who was a famous Indigenous campaigner and negotiator. Joanna Kidman, professor of M\u0101ori education at Victoria University of Wellington, says the appointment of Mahuta could lead to a new, Indigenous-influenced way of conducting New Zealand\u2019s international affairs. \u201cI have been delighted with this appointment. Nanaia Mahuta has been a very hardworking politician for 20 years and she is so well known and so highly respected in the M\u0101ori world. It was really exciting,\u201d Kidman says. \u201cNanaia comes from a long tradition of tribal leaders. She comes from generations of leadership. She works really hard at flax-roots level, she can walk into a room of high-level diplomats and politicians, but she is equally at home on the marae (tribal meeting house).\u201d As the pandemic continues, Mahuta says she will have to \u201cup her Zoom game\u201d as she reaches out to foreign governments online. When asked if anything daunts her about the new portfolio, she is unflinching. \u201cI\u2019m going to put my head down and work things out,\u201d says Mahuta. \u201cI\u2019ll throw everything at it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
