It\u2019s the worst. But it\u2019s the best start ever for the club in the Premier League. It\u2019s strange, no?\u201d At the end of a week in which his side conceded a late equaliser against PSV Eindhoven after a moment of madness from his goalkeeper and captain, Hugo Lloris, the Tottenham manager could not help revealing his frustration. The failure to beat the Dutch champions means that, despite seven victories from nine Premier League matches, Pochettino\u2019s hopes of emulating last season\u2019s run to the last 16 of the Champions League had all but evaporated before the clocks went back. Before the daunting task of facing Manchester City at Wembley on Monday, it was intriguing to hear the former Argentina defender\u2019s assessment of the campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, it is difficult to explain,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cThe circumstances, because many things happen; I am disappointed we are still waiting for the new stadium when the expectation was to be there at the beginning of the season. I don\u2019t know, many things happened in the summer, many things that make myself not in my best mood or best humour. I know I always have a good relationship with you but my feeling is not the best feeling. I had better feelings in previous seasons.\u201d Pochettino laughed off suggestions he could replace Julen Lopetegui should the Real Madrid coach be sacked, so the Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, will not be feeling threatened just yet. Pochettino\u2019s five-year contract signed in the summer was a firm commitment as Spurs prepared to move into the newly refurbished White Hart Lane, but the delayed opening until the new year coupled with a lack of investment in the summer transfer window has not helped raise the manager\u2019s spirits. He has overseen Tottenham\u2019s transformation into serial qualifiers for the Champions League with limited resources in comparison with most of their rivals but finds them agonisingly short of truly competing at the top, mainly because of restrictions imposed on him by the stadium costs. \u201cThe circumstance that happened in the last years, I think the club is not focused completely in winning titles or winning games,\u201d Pochettino admitted. \u201cWe have a lot of focus and you know very well when you are competing with sides, like we are in Champions League and Premier League, the most important thing is to fight in the same conditions as others. \u201cBut the club needs to be all focused in trying to win titles. Because today we need to fix other problems and different circumstances that happen that don\u2019t help the team or the club to only be focused on winning titles. Sometimes people expect that we should be winning or we must win titles when the circumstances are not ideal. To go further, you know better than us.\u201d As he acknowledged, a new stadium is no guarantee of success \u2013 especially against the spending power of a team such as City. \u201cI don\u2019t have the answer how we are going to act when we are going to move there. It is easy to see in the last few years how we act in front of the market, how we act in front of everything and how the other teams were acting. That is the difference. Everything is not perfect but we are in a circumstance and a project that is completely different to another club, at the moment. But maybe when we arrive at the new stadium maybe we will be in the same project, have the same resources as different teams like Liverpool, Man City, United, Chelsea or Arsenal. The way we have been competing in the last few years, the frustration is massive because we have had less in every single aspect.\u201d Tottenham conceded seven goals against Pep Guardiola\u2019s side last season in their two meetings and will be up against opponents who have spent around \u00a3360m more on transfers and three times as much on wages since 2015. No wonder it feels a bit like groundhog day for their manager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
