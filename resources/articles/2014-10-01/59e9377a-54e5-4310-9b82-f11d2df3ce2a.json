It has boldly described the plan, to be unveiled on Friday by the shadow sports minister, Clive Efford, with the backing of Labour\u2019s leader, Ed Miliband, as \u201cthe biggest legislative shake-up in the governance of English and Welsh football clubs since the advent of the game\u201d. Under the new laws each supporters\u2019 trust in the country \u2013 from the Premier League to the Conference \u2013 would have the legal right to representation on the main board of its club, with not fewer than two directors. When a stake of more than 30% in any club in England or Wales changed hands, the purchaser would be obliged to offer 10% of those shares to the supporters\u2019 trust at the average sale price. A supporters\u2019 trust would have 240 days to raise the money to buy the shares. The obligation to sell shares would cease once a trust owned 10% overall. Labour claims the proposals would allow fans to hold clubs to account on issues such as ticket prices, shirt sponsorship, ground naming rights and changing the colour of the strip or the name. \u201cOur view is that the time has come for fans to be represented at this level,\u201d said Efford. \u201cIt is something we will act on and definitely implement.\u201d He said the scheme, which has been in gestation for 12 months and on which he has taken extensive legal advice, would deliver where previous promises of political intervention had failed because it came with a clear commitment to legislate. The commitments will be included in the Labour manifesto and the party has promised to bring forward primary legislation early in a new parliament. \u201cThe Premier League is a huge success. But football is more than a business,\u201d said Jon Cruddas, the head of Labour\u2019s Policy Review. \u201cFootball clubs are part of people\u2019s identity and sense of belonging. Our plan is to give fans a stake in their clubs,. \u201cLabour believes in sharing power and responsibility with people and giving football fans a voice is part of our plan to change our country by devolving power to our cities, towns and communities. We believe in a society that gives power to people.\u201d The Premier League chief executive, Richard Scudamore, has previously described Swansea City\u2019s model, where the club is 20% owned by fans, as the \u201cideal\u201d. Others further down the pyramid, including the former crisis club Portsmouth, are wholly owned by fans. Labour has extensively consulted fans\u2019 groups and with lawyers to ensure the plans are compatible with national and European law and would be acceptable to Uefa. \u201cThere are lots of issues around football. The BBC\u2019s recent survey highlighted issues around the cost of football going up, particularly for families with children,\u201d said Efford. \u201cThere is no way to legislate for all of that, but one way we can force clubs to take on board the consequences of those decisions is to give a strong form of representation to fans.\u201d Efford said that as fans saw that joining the supporter\u2019s trust had a direct impact on decisions being made, they would be more inclined to join. He said its research showed that well over 85% of fans \u201cagreed or strongly agreed\u201d there should be board representation and the ability to acquire a minority stake. \u201cNo one in football denies the special social and community nature of football clubs, yet there has always been a resistance to measures across the board that would actually increase the role of those fans in their clubs,\u201d said a spokesman for Supporters Direct. \u201cThe importance of having a seat at the table where decisions are made has been the central plank of our movement and this organisation.\u201d Fan\u2019s groups have long looked longingly at the \u201c50+1\u201d ownership model in Germany, which they believe has helped keep prices down and maintained bonds between clubs and their communities. But the Premier League would point to attendance levels of more than 95% capacity and its booming popularity at home and overseas as evidence of its appeal. It said it was open to discussing the proposals with Labour but pointed to its \u201cstrong track record on meeting governance challenges\u201d. Its own surveys show 73% of fans are satisfied with how their club is run, rising to 82% among match-going supporters. \u201cBoth we and our clubs work hard to keep in touch with fans, seek their views and respond, one of the many reasons why we currently enjoy the highest stadium occupancy in Europe,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cThe Premier League has a significant fan research programme to that effect, and continues to fund the Football Supporters\u2019 Federation and Supporters Direct, with whom we have regular, open and constructive dialogue.\u201d The Football League sounded caution over the proposals, registering concern that they could deter potential investors. \u201cMany of the individuals that choose to invest in football do so without expecting any financial return on their investment, as they too are supporters of their club,\u201d said the Football League chief executive, Shaun Harvey. \u201cInstead, they do so for a variety of different reasons and we have to be careful not to create barriers that act as a disincentive to the next generation of owners and directors, as the game will only suffer as a consequence.\u201d He also said that if fans owned a stake in their club, it could expose the supporter\u2019s trust to financial losses. \u201cImproved communications with supporters shouldn\u2019t come at the cost of exposing those same supporters to unacceptable levels of financial risk,\u201d added Harvey. \u201cFrom personal experience and that of club directors that I speak with, there is no surer way of jeopardising a Saturday afternoon\u2019s enjoyment than being responsible for it on a Monday morning.\u201d All the major political parties promised to advance the cause of fan ownership before the last election, which coincided with the meltdown at Portsmouth, chaos at Liverpool and the height of the green and gold protests at Old Trafford. Just prior to the election, the Guardian revealed that then prime minister Gordon Brown had signed off on an ambitious plan to give fans a stake in their clubs. The coaliltion agreement promised to explore ideas that that would give fans a greater say in how their clubs were run. But little has happened since, despite a thorough and exhaustive review conducted by the Culture, Media and Sport select committee. The sports minister, Helen Grant, will point to an expert working group that is due to be convened with representatives from supporter\u2019s trusts to examine the practical obstacles to greater fan ownership. \u201cThe government is completely committed to helping supporters have better engagement with the clubs they support and more of a say on how they are run,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is exactly why we have been working with Supporters Direct and the football authorities to establish an expert working group on the matter.\u201d Most clubs are likely to argue that they are already making moves to consult more constructively with fans on the issues that affect them and that legislation is unnecessary. Asked whether having fan representation on the board would change the approach of Vincent Tan at Cardiff or Assem Allam at Hull City, Efford insisted it would. \u201cIf fans have got to be listened to on issues like the colour of the shirt or the sponsor or moving to a new ground 30 miles up the road, at least the directors will be aware of their views when they make those decisions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
