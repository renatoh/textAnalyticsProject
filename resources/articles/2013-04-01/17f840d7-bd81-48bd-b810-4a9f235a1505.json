Equally stunning was the suspended stage with a flying gallery for cloud effects. Everyone warned that Sunken Garden, given its world premiere last week, would be a coup de theatre. In fact those opening words describe Inigo Jones's set designs in the early 17th century, which would pave the way for the adventures of Purcell and Handel. Even in its earliest form, opera embraced innovation, the balance between wondrous music and technical ingenuity being an abiding feature. Think of Wagner and his specially designed theatre in Bayreuth. Therefore you can quite understand why ENO and its partners in Lyon, Toronto and the Netherlands said yes to the lure of the new. The music for Sunken Garden, \"an occult-mystery film opera\", is by Michel van der Aa (b1970), a highly individual Dutch composer. He is also, on this occasion, the director, online cook and offline bottle-washer. His poetic Up-close (2010) for cello, string ensemble and film was outstanding. He has won major awards, such as the Grawemeyer, and his music defies easy categorisation. The librettist is the bestselling novelist David Mitchell. His multiply-plotted Cloud Atlas was recently made into a movie of epic length if not always achievement. This \"film opera\", too, has an overwrought plot. To precis would use up too much available space. Some key words are parachute, psychiatric ward, paranoid delusion, occult engine and vertical pond. Two singers are pre-filmed. The three on stage, who interact with those on celluloid, are amplified. So too are members of the 26-piece instrumental ensemble, the aim being that all the sounds occur within the same \"space\". Pre-recorded electronics are played \"live\", all cued by the conductor. The work is mixed, live, by the sound designer David Sheppard. On first night, the levels kept changing as if someone were moving the volume knob up and down. I don't think this was intentional. Sunken Garden runs for two hours without an interval. It may be one hour longer than quite necessary. Thus the chief impact might be expected to be the visual and aural execution. If you're handed rather nice 3D specs at the door and instructed mysteriously to put them on when you get to the flyover you know you can expect a special kind of ride. Some audience members put them on immediately, assuming \"flyover\" be some sort of technical word for entering the Barbican theatre. Instead it was a filmed sequence of a road about halfway through. We then entered a magic garden (filmed at the Eden Project) which had luscious greenery and insect life. Some of these popped out of the screen at us, the way things do in 3D. The mix of minimal staging and vivid cinematic imagery was reasonably slickly handled, despite a certain early Doctor Who air to some of the more clumsy interactions. If you follow installation art, even at a modest level, you will be familiar with this sort of thing. If not it may, conceivably, appear fresh. Fortunately the performances were strong, and in the case of Roderick Williams, who plays Toby Kramer, \"a wannabe video artist\" who is making a film about a vanished IT contractor, excellent. He made each word audible and brought grace to every utterance, not easy given the slow pace of the vocal writing. Katherine Manley and Claron McFadden, the other \"live\" characters, were sympathetic but verbally largely incomprehensible. (There were no surtitles.) A tender and fragile Kate Miller-Heidke put a strong case for the virtues of being a living hologram, and Jonathan McGovern, the ardent-voiced lost IT man, was a real discovery. A sudden change of mood and pace occurred when McGovern's character, Simon, sings a lament for his baby, a cot death victim. This was a powerful aria: one of opera's most traditional ingredients leapt out of all the hypertech and cyberworld frippery and ambushed us completely, no 3D specs required. Yearning and weeping, his suffering was all the more piercing for its control and lyricism. A duet, another standard operatic form, later had a similar power. True to form, Van der Aa's instrumental writing held one's interest throughout, fast moving in contrast to the unvaried writing for voice. Orchestral textures remained light and transparent. A large viola section gave mellow prominence to the middle range, while the ever-present trumpet (Julian Brewer) cut through the delicate web of electronics and percussion. The fatal weakness lies in the dialogue. The characters fail to come alive, despite the best efforts of the performers. In the film sequences, actors speak lines so banal my neighbour was writhing in his chair. A few weary jokes about modern art (of the \"whoops, they put it in the dustbin by mistake\" variety) and, worse, about the police (of the \"all candidates should leave their brains at the door\" variety) provoked strained laughter. No one ever said opera is easy. The week took a sombre turn with the announcement of the death, aged 85, of Sir Colin Davis \u2013 a conductor revered for his championing of Mozart, Berlioz and Sibelius. Despite stints abroad, his career placed him at the centre of British musical life, through his associations with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra and, from 1971 to 1986, the Royal Opera House. He was due back there next season. Some 24 hours after his death it was baffling to attend a performance \u2013 of Nabucco \u2013 without some acknowledgment of him. The following night's Mozart revival was to be dedicated to him, we learned later, but still this seemed an omission. Perhaps no one wished to cast a further pall on the near moribund Nabucco, directed by Daniele Abbado, conducted by Nicola Luisotti and reviewed, coolly, by my colleague Stephen Pritchard two weeks ago. The reason to revisit was the debut of Pl\u00e1cido Domingo as the Babylonian king of the title, the latest baritone role this septuagenarian tenor has added to his phenomenal career. The rest of the singing, with the exception of the excellent chorus, was rough, Luisotti's conducting unyielding and rhetorical. Yet nothing could obscure Domingo's towering stage presence. The voice, in this lower range, remains underpowered. But this consummate artist used his own vocal frailty to match the psychological journey of the despot he was playing. With careful brilliance he built his own physical hesitations \u2013 some problem with his knee? \u2013 into the staging. His every appearance is to be treasured. One brief word on the recital given last week by Mark Padmore, a tenor with no present signs of going baritonal, and pianist Graham Johnson in Oxford. They had built a programme around Britten (including Winter Words) and Schubert. As an encore they performed Schubert's Die Taubenpost. This apparently simple song is a radiant celebration of selfless love and constancy: a carrier pigeon carries the lover's messages through rain and shine and asks for nothing in return. Johnson, fount of all knowledge on the art of song, spoke a few words of introduction. Britten, a fine pianist, and his partner Peter Pears sang much Schubert. After Britten's death, Pears tried to sing this song and had to stop halfway through. \"It was the only time I saw him break down,\" Johnson said. Padmore and his pianist, on this occasion, turned it into a thing of rapture."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
