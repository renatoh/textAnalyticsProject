Forensic expert Frank Swann today revealed the full findings of his investigation into the deaths of four soldiers, raising pressure on the army for a public inquiry into the deaths. Sean Benton, 20, Cheryl James, 18, Geoff Gray, 17 and James Collinson, 17, died from gunshot wounds at the Surrey barracks. Mr Swann discovered that Benton, James and Gray could not have killed themselves. His findings on the death of Collinson, who died in March 2002, were inconclusive. The report concluded that James, from Llangollen, in north Wales, was trying to push the gun away from her face when she was shot at the barracks. Mr Swann, who was hired by the families to investigate the deaths, said: \"It is my expert opinion - based on the evidence, the nature of the wounds and the tests and experiments that I carried out - that Private Cheryl James did not self-inflict the bullet wound that killed her.\" Her father Des James said: \"There are so many unanswered questions for our family, and until we have them answered we cannot put this behind us. \"This is the first expert witness who has told me that Cheryl's death was not self-inflicted. \"But the police say there were no third parties involved. It just does not make sense. \"If this does not call for a public inquiry, then I do not know what does.\" The report also found that it would have been physically impossible for the injuries sustained by Benton, who died in June 1995 from five gunshot wounds, and Gray, who was shot dead in September 2002, to have been self-inflicted. The report has now been passed to the Surrey Coroner. A \u00a31m, 15-month inquiry by Surrey police into the deaths found no evidence of foul play, but criticised the treatment of trainee soldiers by the army. The families of the victims have claimed that a culture of bullying and intimidation existed at the barracks and contributed to the deaths."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
