The lure of keeping alive the grand slam might well incline them to go for the corner again, though the decision-making and execution would have to be radically different from that fateful day the sides last met. England are confident it will be. \u201cIt is all in the preparation, I\u2019d say,\u201d said George Kruis, who will now be calling the lineout should the other new decision-maker, Dylan Hartley, decide to go for the corner. \u201cWe train different scenarios so that when you come to game time, and you\u2019ve got a difficult thing to decide, you make that right decision. It\u2019s all in scenarios and experience. You look at a standard lineout, you can have anywhere between 20 and 50 calls.\u201d However much the previous regime has been discredited, it would be naive to imagine they had not rehearsed just as many what-if scenarios. But it is one thing to talk about them in front of a whiteboard, another to see the truth through the fury of a Test match and seize it. England\u2019s failure at the World Cup was due less to technical faults and more to a catastrophic loss of nerve at every level. This Saturday, for all the hype, the stakes will not be quite as high, and England ought to go in to the game with the confidence of a team who have known how bad it can get. \u201cI wasn\u2019t part of the group then and I\u2019m very reticent to look back,\u201d Steve Borthwick, England\u2019s forwards coach, said, \u201cbut it\u2019s one of those experiences \u2013 like they all are \u2013 that help to shape us and improve us.\u201d England have been dealt a significant blow by the loss of Jamie George for the rest of the tournament with a ruptured tendon in his biceps. Luke Cowan-Dickie steps up for a place on the bench, but the 22-year-old has started just twice for Exeter since his return from injury at the end of January and his precision duties at the lineout remain a work in progress. If it does come down to another late lineout, he could be the one delivering the ball. In Borthwick, though, England have a lineout obsessive among their brains trust, which was not the case with the previous regime. After hiccups against Italy, that set piece operated smoothly against Ireland, with Kruis playing the rugby of his life. Borthwick is confident, however, that England are better equipped now to deal with a high-pressure lineout, should the situation demand one. \u201cAn important thing is to vary our point of attack,\u201d he said, \u201chow much we drive, how much we go off the top. And having different deliveries to ask different questions makes us harder to analyse. Those are things we plan to integrate more into our game. We do a lot of work with the players, putting them into different scenarios. All we are asking is to make the right decisions at the right time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
