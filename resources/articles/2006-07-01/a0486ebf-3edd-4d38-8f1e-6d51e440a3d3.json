Nearly a decade of conflict has created a humanitarian crisis that kills the youngest and most vulnerable - through hunger and disease as well as violence. The 1998-2003 war is officially over but insecurity continues to displace civilians and cripple efforts to supply food and basic medical care, according to the UN's children's agency, Unicef. \"Children bear the brunt of conflict, disease and death, but not only as casualties,\" said Tony Bloomberg, a Unicef official. \"They are also witnesses to, and sometimes forced participants in, atrocities and crimes that inflict physical and psychological harm.\" More than 4 million people are thought to have died since the country imploded, making it the bloodiest conflict since the second world war. Some 1,200 die every day, around half of them children. In a land the size of western Europe but with scant infrastructure it is not possible to count the precise number of victims. Martin Bell, the former BBC reporter and MP who is a Unicef ambassador, said the July 30 election offered some hope. \"We owe it to the children to give them the future they deserve ... these elections may be the opportunity of their lifetime.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
