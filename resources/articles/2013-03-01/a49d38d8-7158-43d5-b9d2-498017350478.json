Speaking on the morning of the budget Bazalgette will argue that \"there is no city in Britain that does not understand the importance of the arts and culture, both as central to the life of the city and to the local economy.\" Heseltine's thinking on post-industrial cities in the 1980s was an important precursor to cultural regeneration plans in places such as Liverpool and Gateshead. Bazalgette, who became chair of the Arts Council in January, also called on business to do more for the arts. \"I don't think business is pulling its weight at the moment,\" he said, speaking ahead of the lecture at the Royal Society for the Arts in London. \"They have recalibrated and reset their balance sheets since 2008 but have not come back into the arts sponsorship game. They can do more and it is in their interests to do so.\" The former creative director of Endemol, the company behind TV shows such as Big Brother, will argue that survival and development in Britain's hard-pressed arts scene is possible if a so-called \"grand partnership\" is created between local authorities, businesses, universities, philanthropists and Arts Council England. He will emphasise the dangers for the arts amid cuts from central government. \"People on the ground are coping with Arts Council England having dropped funding to arts organisations by 15% after the last comprehensive spending review in 2010, then in the autumn statement the arts lost another 2% and 1% on top of that in successive years,\" he said. \"On top of that, local authorities, in the face of rapidly rising social care costs, are cutting, and we've seen Somerset council and Westminster councils cut their arts budgets by 100%.\" If councils cut culture budgets by \"as much as they think they are going to have to\" over the coming years, the problem for the arts will be \"very big\", he said. But, speaking of Newcastle council's recent proposal to cut its arts budget by 100% , which was overturned after an intervention from the shadow culture secretary, Harriet Harman, he said he believed the single most important factor in the council's change of heart was the \"realisation of how much reputational damage there would be\" to the city and \"the business community in the city turning round and saying to the council, 'What are you thinking of?'\" Bazalgette reiterated the Arts Council's ultimate threat: that it will not allow itself to be the sole public funder of the arts in any one area, and will itself pull out funds if loss of council money makes arts organisations untenable \u2013 a threat dangled in the negotiations in Newcastle earlier this year. But, he said, \"What we have not had in the past few weeks is another major council intending to walk away completely from the arts. Manchester and Birmingham are continuing to support the arts and Wakefield, for example, is increasing it \u2013 because it understands that culture is a tourist magnet.\" Funding from Arts Council England was \"seedcorn investment\" for the arts, he said, which was then being used in highly imaginative ways by arts organisations to help them survive the current \"harsh reality\". His speech will praise Live Theatre in Newcastle, which runs a restaurant and a pub, \"so for every pork pie or scotch egg bought there, money goes towards producing vital new writing for their award-winning theatre\". He added: \"Commentators sometimes forget that every theatre, gallery, museum, orchestra, dance company is also a business led by clever, ambitious women and men.\" He also pointed to Derby Theatre , which has been taken over by Derby University and \"given a new lease of life as a live venue and a training centre.\" He said: \"If you can find a way of getting the arts and culture, local government, business and higher education to work together then you have something really powerful.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
