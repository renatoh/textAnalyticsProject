The clubs feel that they have moved a long way in the past couple of weeks, increasing their offer from around \u00a39m a season to \u00a316.6m. The rejection of that offer at the weekend has brought a strike, and retaliatory legal action, that much closer. The chief executive of the Premier League, Richard Scudamore, is reported to have told Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, during negotiations yesterday that Premier League chairmen are not prepared to talk for much longer. Taylor was warned that the offer was unlikely to increase significantly. He was also warned that the Premier League has not yet resorted to a full public relations offensive in the row over television money and that both parties should stick to an agreement not to discuss the matter in public. \"It's like we're climbing Everest with a long way to go,\" Taylor said yesterday. He hinted that industrial action could begin as soon as next week. \"We don't want to feel we are being strung along,\" he told Sky. \"Time is of the essence and I want people to concentrate their minds to really get to the main thrust of the issue.\" The Premier League has already taken legal advice and believes that it has a strong case over the PFA's threat of strike action if it does not receive 5% of the current \u00a31.6bn television deal. A club source said: \"We are very serious about taking this matter to court. It's got to the point now where we have negotiated as much as we can and the feeling now is that let's test this out in court. We can't negotiate much further.\" Premiership club chairmen met last week to discuss the dispute and all except Manchester United are believed to be prepared to resolve the matter in court. The feelings of chairmen and their determination not to increase the offer was made clear to Taylor by Scudamore during lengthy negotiations in central London yesterday. The two parties are to continue talks today. Another club source said: \"The mood is definitely hardening. There's a huge amount of funding on the table and the feeling is that enough is enough. If the PFA drags the game through the mud by calling for a strike then they had better be damn sure of their legal position because it will be all or nothing as far as we are concerned.\" Premiership chairmen are also keen to avoid a repeat of the row knowing that the issue of television money for the PFA will have to be renegotiated in three years' time, when the current deal expires. Premier League officials and chairmen are believed to be working on a new formula over funding from television money for the PFA. During yesterday's negotiations, Scudamore claimed that only two European national associations provide players' organisations with funding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
