City are the Premier League leaders, the only side with a maximum 12 points from four games. They also dismantled Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 4-0 in their Champions League group opener on Wednesday, and Guardiola is clear on why his team is playing so well. \u201cOur behaviour without the ball is what we did [well] in these seven games,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means play like a team in the second league, the third league, in the Conference league, playing with honesty. If we do that, the people will be proud of us. That\u2019s what I want. \u201cI know the quality of the players. They are still making mistakes sometimes with the buildup, with the position in the middle. That is normal. There\u2019s a lot of time to improve it. \u201cThe desire when the opposition has the ball, in saying \u2018No, I want that ball for me\u2019 and how we go to pick it up, if we continue that to the end of the season, we will be a good team. I am pretty sure of that, because the quality of the players that this club have bought in the past and the new players who came in this year is high. If not, you cannot produce in a short time the performance we managed against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know them, but I know M\u00f6nchengladbach really well, and I know that in the few moments we arrived a little bit late with our pressure, we were not good. That\u2019s happened. Fortunately, it only happened a few times, because we were so aggressive without the ball, and with the ball we created chances.\u201d Guardiola would not rule out excluding Vincent Kompany once the captain is fit if he does not prove he deserves to start. The Belgian has not played since injuring a thigh in May and under Guardiola, John Stones has partnered either Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi or Aleksandar Kolarov in central defence. \u201cFor me, when he\u2019s ready \u2013 how difficult? Absolutely nothing,\u201d the manager said of leaving out Kompany. \u201cThey have to compete with each other, we\u2019ll see on the pitch what is the best for that game. \u201cThe best way to arrive in April or May with a chance to fight to win the titles [is] we need the players competing with each other. I need Vincent because I know his quality. I need him to put pressure on John Stones, Nico Otamendi, Kolarov \u2013 all of them.\u201d Guardiola has so far used Stones during games to communicate messages, and the defender said he has leadership ambitions. \u201cI\u2019d like to be captain one day,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery player wants to be captain of their team and to do so for years to come. It\u2019s a privileged position to be in, to captain your club and country. These are dreams you dream about when you\u2019re a little boy. \u201cYou have to deserve the right to be captain but I\u2019d love to be one day and I\u2019ll keep working hard to try to be.\u201d Of what Guardiola says to him, Stones said: \u201cHe\u2019s talking to me about the opposition, how they\u2019re playing. I suppose it\u2019s easier for me to run over than a midfielder or a striker and I can then tell everyone from there. It\u2019s just little details in games that are good to pass on. It\u2019s all about how we can beat the opposition and that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do to us as well. Little formation changes or how we can beat a certain system.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
