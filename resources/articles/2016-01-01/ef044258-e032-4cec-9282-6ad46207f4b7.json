The managers were quick to turn their attention to the issue after seeing wonderful attacking repeatedly sabotaged by woeful defending. J\u00fcrgen Klopp attributed all of Norwich\u2019s goals to Liverpool\u2019s feeble handling of set pieces \u2013 although Norwich\u2019s creativity and sharpness were also important factors \u2013 and said his team\u2019s vulnerability to them has become a mental problem rather than a technical one. He said constant mistakes are undermining his players\u2019 confidence and triggering a vicious circle of ineptitude \u2013 and demanded his players become strong enough to put a stop to it. \u201cIt\u2019s like a self-fulfilling prophecy,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s talking about it, we\u2019re thinking about it. You see in a situation and it\u2019s \u2018a cross, pap, good\u2019, then \u2018OK, second ball\u2019, \u2018second ball, oh my God!\u2019. That\u2019s the situation.\u201d The manager said he finds the problem all the more galling because he knows his players are good enough to defend set pieces well \u2013 because he used to be able to do so and the former Mainz defender was never as a good as them. \u201cI was an under-average player but if I was good at something it was defending set plays. It\u2019s not that difficult. So we know how to defend. We have to do it now.\u201d Klopp could barely believe his defenders left Dieumerci Mbokani onside following a corner, thereby giving the Congolese striker an opportunity to score Norwich\u2019s opening goal with a splendid backheel from seven yards. Klopp was also aghast Norwich were allowed to build nicely down the right before Wes Hoolahan released Steven Naismith to plunder a fine goal on his debut. And Klopp can only have been exasperated by the witless pair of fouls perpetrated by Alberto Moreno that enabled Hoolahan to put Norwich 3-1 up from a penalty. On the flip side he was delighted with how Liverpool fought back after that. \u201cThat was really good football,\u201d he said, although they suffered a relapse in the second minute of stoppage time when they failed to deal with a long free-kick, inviting S\u00e9bastien Bassong to hammer a spectacular shot into the net from 20 yards to make it 4-4. It did not seem possible that there could be another twist after that, but Adam Lallana provided one by volleying in the winner two minutes later. What that proved, at least, was that Liverpool do not have difficulty scoring goals even when they start without a classic centre-forward, as they did here, with Roberto Firmino the farthest forward while Christian Benteke began on the bench again. The Brazilian was brilliant and not only because he scored twice. His passing gave his team fluency and incisiveness and his immaculate control helped him bring others into play even though he is far more lightweight than typical target men. \u201cAfter Manchester United, everybody asked me: \u2018What about Firmino, you need a real target striker?\u2019 But he scored two against Arsenal and he scored two here,\u201d Klopp said. According to Klopp, to suggest Firmino is not a striker is to be duped by a narrow definition. \u201cI think it\u2019s a wide spectrum. Roberto is a striker. He\u2019s a very offensive player. A lot of strikers are 1.60 metres or 1.70 metres-something. Leo Messi what is he? Let\u2019s discuss about this. Firmino can play and score goals and he is for us a good option to play with. He is flexible and in brilliant shape. Having the option with Christian, that\u2019s good. We have too many games where I can say: \u2018This or this is No1\u2019. We have always to make decisions.\u201d Klopp was particularly pleased with the way Firmino created Liverpool\u2019s second goal, flicking on the ball for the unmarked Jordan Henderson to drive into the net. \u201cI would say we had, this season, 350 times a player in exactly this position but we didn\u2019t play the pass,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s frustrating for a manager. Then here we played the pass and in this moment I was happier.\u201d Alex Neil was very unhappy. The Norwich manager had been encouraged by the first hour of the match but was left reeling by the blunders that handed the initiative back to Liverpool, most notably Russell Martin\u2019s blind backpass that James Milner intercepted to put Liverpool 4-3 up. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamentals that we\u2019re doing wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you stop somebody giving a short backpass to somebody? How do you stop somebody maybe not tracking a runner? We had much more control of the game until 65 minutes. For it to happen so late, when everything was fine basically, is just bizarre.\u201d Neil could at least take satisfaction from the performances of his debutants, with Naismith offering new thrust to the team\u2019s attack, while Ivo Pinto was relatively solid at right-back. Another January recruit, the centre-back Timm Klose, watched from the bench following his arrival from Wolfsburg. After what happened here, he is likely to start soon. There may be many other changes, too. \u201cCertainly after that, there\u2019s no question there\u2019ll be places up for grabs,\u201d Neil said.
