Lampard tore the outside of the thigh muscle on his left leg while training with his England team-mates in Doha on Thursday and, having undergone a scan with the Football Association's medical staff in Qatar, was cleared to return back to Cobham for treatment. Chelsea's medical department conducted their own tests yesterday amid fears that the 31-year-old might be absent until Christmas. Yet, despite the player having suffered thigh problems in the recent past \u2013 he was twice ruled out for a little over a month in the second half of 2007, suggesting there may be a weakness in the muscle \u2013 the club's initial prognosis was that he might be absent only for three weeks. That would rule him out of the Premier League games with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Arsenal, the Champions League tie at Porto and the Carling Cup quarter-final at Blackburn Rovers in the first week in December. It remains to be seen whether he will be fit in time for the match at Manchester City on 5 December. \"The Chelsea medical department's initial impression is that he may take three weeks to recover,\" said a spokesman. The FA's default compensation procedure will now kick in, with the club satisfied that the injury was not caused by either the team's travel to Qatar or by any of the training upon their arrival."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
