The report will intensify debate over squeezed living standards, and whether tax cuts as proposed by the prime minister are the best way to help ease the pressure on earnings. The commission's annual report \u2013 delayed until after the party conference season \u2013 is also expected to call for more help for the poor, pointing out that tax-free childcare being provided by the government is not progressive and needs to be rethought. The call for a rethink comes as the Department for Education consults on its proposals for tax-free childcare vouchers. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has warned that 900,000 families will be excluded from receiving any extra help, if either parent is earning less than \u00a310,000 a year, the threshold for paying income tax. Yet government proposals will give working parents who earn up to \u00a3150,000 each extra funding to bring down their childcare bills. Parents on low incomes who earn enough to pay income tax will receive 85% of their costs. Those families not paying tax will continue to receive an existing 70% subsidy that falls far short of covering childcare costs for many, leaving the lowest paid gaining nothing or even paying more than they earn for working extra hours. It is likely that second earners (usually mothers) on low incomes working part time will also lose out. Current childcare bills average \u00a34.26 per hour, a cost that has made it difficult for the poorest families to work their way out of poverty. The Resolution Foundation research on which Milburn's social mobility commission has drawn finds that under universal credit, many low income families who work beyond 15 hours a week \u2013 when free, state-funded early years provision ceases \u2013 face earning nothing or even face paying up to \u00a31 for every extra hour they work. The Resolution Foundation has warned only 160,000 families in the bottom 40% of the income distribution will qualify for new help, compared to 1.7 million in the top 40% by income. A consortium led by Barnardos is calling on the government to fund 85% of childcare costs for all families on universal credit. This would cost \u00a3200m, and could be funded from the \u00a3750m set aside to fund childcare for higher income families. They are hoping to receive direct backing from Milburn when he publishes his report. More broadly, the report will fuel the debate about who has been benefiting in the recession and who is likely to do best from the recovery. In a taste of the argument, Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), said: \"The state of the nation report will show quite clearly that the outlook for everyone, except the super-rich, is bleaker than it has been for more than half a century. \"The deadly cycle of poverty leading to educational underachievement, followed by underemployment, and then poverty of ambition for the next generation has now infected huge areas of society and the policies of this coalition government are making it much harder to break out of this cycle. \"Support for families is vital. The government must put its money where its rhetoric is, stem the closure of children's centres, and ensure the services families need \u2013 health, employment, parenting-classes, education \u2013 are available close to where families live\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
