The youngsters combined impressively in their first match together, the 20-12 victory over New Zealand that took England to the final. But when asked about the difficulties of preparing to face two relatively unknown quantities, the Kangaroos coach, Tim Sheens, said: \"It's a new combination for England, too. We'll certainly have to put that combination under a bit of pressure and see how it works then.\" Anthony Watmough, the Manly second row who has some previous in this department after cleaning out the diminutive Leeds half-back Rob Burrow with a ferocious but legal hit in the World Club Challenge in February, added: \"Timmy likes us to put pressure on all the halves out there. If there's three or four of us going at them, they've certainly got some thinking to do.\" But Eorl Crabtree, the huge Huddersfield forward who has been another of England's Four Nations success stories, insisted that neither Tomkins nor Eastmond would be fazed by extra pressure from Watmough and his team-mates. \"You'd be surprised how mature they are,\" he said. \"They might not be old but they've got good heads on their shoulders, and so far they've handled everything that's been thrown at them.\" Crabtree was visibly moved when he was praised by Petero Civoniceva, one of the stalwarts of the Australia pack, at an Elland Road press conferenceyesterday. \"I've had to wait a long time to be involved in anything like this, and I'm loving every minute,\" said the nephew of the late wrestler Big Daddy, who has been given a double room in the England hotel in Leeds because he could not squeeze into the single beds in the twin rooms being shared by the squad. Steve McNamara, assistant to the England coach, Tony Smith, refused to rule out the possibility of changing a winning team. Sheens down-played speculation that he will drop the Brisbane centre Justin Hodges to make way for Penrith's Michael Jennings, who scored a hat-trick in Australia's 42-4 win against France in Paris last Saturday. \"You've got to keep in perspective who we were playing,\" he added.Australia's wing Jarryd Hayne was last night named the International Player of the Year, partly because of his performances for Fiji in last autumn's World Cup. The Leeds and England back Ryan Hall won two awards as the best international rookie and wing of the year, with his Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield and England's Wests Tigers forward Gareth Ellis also named the best in their positions \u2013 loose forward and second-row respectively. Meanwhile, the row over who should referee the final rumbled on, with a decision now expected on Tuesday.
