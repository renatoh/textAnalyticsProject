Boris Johnson shuns mayoral hustings", "bodyText": "It is a crude, if effective, campaign strategy for a frontrunner. Keep your candidate on a tight leash, stop him saying anything controversial and avoid the opposition. That, it seems, is the theory behind Boris Johnson's bid to become the mayor of London. Yesterday it emerged he has failed to appear at a series of clashes with rival candidates Ken Livingstone and Brian Paddick, raising suspicions that the famously gaffe-prone Tory is being protected from himself. Johnson, who has offended the black community (describing Africans as having \"watermelon smiles\" and talking of \"piccaninnies\"), an entire city (Liverpool, for wallowing in self-pity), and a nation (Papua New Guinea, for indulging in cannibalism), will be at a private dinner tonight, rather than speaking at a mayoral hustings along with his rivals. The organisers are furious at his non-appearance - his third no-show in recent weeks. Johnson insisted yesterday that a diary clash was to blame, and said he wasn't the only candidate to have missed high-profile events. However, political rivals and those who have been snubbed detect the influence of his Australian campaign manager, Lynton Crosby. A hard-nosed strategist who has worked for the former Conservative leader Michael Howard and the former Australian prime minister John Howard, he is carefully stage-managing Johnson so he doesn't lose momentum at a time when he is leading the field. Senior Tory sources have also made clear that David Cameron \"will not allow\" his Old Etonian friend to damage the party nationally by putting his foot in it. Michael Hodges, the editor-at-large of Time Out magazine which organised this evening's event, was in no doubt as to what lay behind the decision not to turn up. \"It's all part of an attempt to manage Johnson's public appearances and make sure that they are only in front of friendly crowds and that he is shielded from himself,\" he said. \"We weren't trying to set him up, we just wanted to have the main candidates there for our readers.\" Hodges added that Johnson's decision to withdraw from this and other hustings had \"really put the issue at the top of the agenda\" and ensured it had moved from the blogosphere into the national press. Last night a spokesman for Livingstone's campaign said: \"This must be the only election where the campaign is scared of their candidate, which is why they have blocked him from appearing on Any Questions - unlike Ken and Brian Paddick - and why they have pulled him from the Time Out debate. \"Boris Johnson's minders have decided they have got to keep their candidate away from any detailed scrutiny and challenge - by his opponents, by voters and by the media.\" Since the start of the campaign, Johnson has turned down two other events which Paddick and Livingstone attended. During last week's Any Questions on BBC Radio 4, which featured Paddick as a panellist, Jonathan Dimbleby said Livingstone had already appeared while Johnson had declined the invitation. He added: \"Inevitably we asked the other leading candidate, Boris Johnson, if he would like to join the programme and he declined saying that he didn't wish to discuss national issues while he was concentrating on the London mayoral election.\" Giles Barrie, editor of Property Week, said although they had given Johnson six weeks notice for their hustings event, he refused, citing a prior engagement. Last night Johnson's team swatted away suggestions that their candidate had been muzzled. A spokeswoman said he was \"never going\" to attend the Time Out hustings, adding that it was \"factually incorrect\" to suggest a date had been fixed as Johnson had already agreed to attend a dinner for local newspaper editors. She said he would be happy to appear on Any Questions if it were in London. \"Boris has attended a number of hustings this year and was disappointed that Time Out changed the date which made it impossible to attend,\" she said. \"He is keen to take part in as many debates as possible and has been sorry that Ken Livingstone has missed so many already this year, such as addressing young people in Islington about gun and knife crime and small businesses at the FSB.\" Despite the tight leash on which he is kept, Johnson has allowed the odd flash of his former jocular self to break through. Last Saturday, the Independent columnist Johann Hari wrote of interviewing the Tory candidate for the gay magazine Attitude. When pressed on whether he agreed with Livingstone's ancient assertion that everyone is potentially bisexual, he said: \"Oh, I am a polymorphous pervert.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
