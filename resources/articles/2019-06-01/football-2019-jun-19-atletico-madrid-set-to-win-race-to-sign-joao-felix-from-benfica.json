The two clubs have been locked in negotiations this week with the player\u2019s agent, Jorge Mendes, also talking to Benfica to find an agreement. The 19-year-old, who has been linked with moves to several top European clubs this summer including Manchester City and United, has agreed a five-year deal with the La Liga club and the transfers should be completed this week. Atl\u00e9tico are still hoping to pay less than the player\u2019s buy-out clause but are resigned to agree to signing the player for \u20ac120m if Benfica refuse to budge. It has been a hectic summer at the Spanish club so far with Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez joining Bayern Munich for \u00a368m, Diego God\u00edn making the move to Inter after nine years at Atl\u00e9tico and Antoine Griezmann and Rodri set to leave. Griezmann is expected to join Barcelona when his contract expires and Rodri is set to move to Manchester City for \u20ac70m. F\u00e9lix has scored 15 goals in 26 league games for Benfica and made his debut for Portugal against Switzerland in the Nations League this month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
