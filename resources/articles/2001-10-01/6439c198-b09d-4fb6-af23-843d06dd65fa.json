In a letter to staff, acting group chief executive Larry Stanley said: \"The losses we face are truly staggering. They exceed anything we ever anticipated in Aer Lingus and right now it is survival that is our challenge.\" Unions had expected job losses when bookings plummeted after the September 11 attacks on the US. Transatlantic bookings fell by 80%, the company is losing IR\u00a32m (\u00a31.5m) every day and cash reserves are set to run out by the beginning of next year. Ireland's minister for public enterprise, Mary O'Rourke, said she hoped the EU's executive commission would authorise Ireland to provide Aer Lingus with emergency aid, mostly in the form of loans, at a meeting of EU transport commissioners next week. EU law bars the 15 member states from subsidising their national carriers. But a European commission statement today said the exceptional economic fallout from the September 11 attacks meant it would give \"favourable consideration\" to emergency compensation for state-owned airlines. Aer Lingus, which flies to Britain, continental Europe and five US cities, has \u00a3115m in cash reserves, which are projected to run out by February. The airline had already lost money before September 11. \"The government is determined the airline will be saved for strategic and national purposes on the basis of a slimmed-down operation and a viable plan,\" said Ms O'Rourke. Aer Lingus had earlier announced plans to lay off 1,700 of its 6,500 employees and cancel a quarter of its flights, including services to Washington and Newark, New Jersey. But unions were told today that the airline now planned to cut closer to 2,500 jobs. \"The loss of 2,500 jobs would devastate Aer Lingus and could validly be interpreted as stage one of a total shutdown of the airline,\" said Jim Higgins, a member of the opposition Fine Gael party. He appealed for immediate EU approval of a loan package. Economic analysts say Aer Lingus would need a loan of around \u00a3100m, partly to cover severance packages. On Monday the airline announced a slew of cheap fares in a bid to fill its planes, including midweek round-trip flights to New York and Boston for \u00a3169. Aer Lingus hopes that the Irish government can provide loans similar to those already given by Switzerland and Belgium to their endangered national carriers, Swissair and Sabena. Both airlines filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month. Swiss authorities offered about \u00a3193m in loans to keep Swissair flying this month, while Sabena - jointly owned by Swissair and the Belgian government - is receiving about \u00a380m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
