Neither Juventus nor Real Madrid, his rumoured suitors, will be keen on paying that much, though the Mail reports that Real feel they could buy him for around \u00a3133m, and the Sun that the Spaniards \u201cwould be happy to throw in Gareth Bale or Isco as part of the deal\u201d. The Sun also predicts that United will now \u201cembark on a frantic fortnight of business\u201d as they attempt to complete their squad rebuilding in time for the start of pre-season training. The Times says that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer \u201cwants to sign four more players\u201d, with Youri Tielemans still on their radar \u2013 though Monaco would like an offputting \u00a340m for him \u2013 as well as Newcastle\u2019s Sean Longstaff, while \u201cas many as six players could leave in the coming weeks\u201d. In Spain, Mundo Deportivo says that United will need \u201cmoral as well as sporting reinforcements\u201d should Pogba depart, and are considering a move for one or both of Ivan Rakitic and Philippe Coutinho. Internationally it\u2019s not Pogba hogging the front pages but Neymar, who according to L\u2019Equipe is singing \u201cle chant du d\u00e9part\u201d (RM history lesson: Le Chant du D\u00e9part was a popular revolutionary tune written in 1794 and still familiar in France, whose title translates as the Song of Departure). Neymar has apparently grown frustrated at PSG\u2019s lack of European success, while PSG have grown frustrated with Neymar\u2019s entitled strops, so a move elsewhere would suit both parties. The news came after the club\u2019s chairman, Nasser al-Khelaifi, told France Football that the club\u2019s players \u201cwill have to do more and work harder\u201d in future. \u201cThey are not there for their own amusement,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they do not agree, the doors are open \u2013 ciao! I do not want star behaviour any more.\u201d Now all PSG require is to convince one of about three global clubs who might be able to finance Neymar\u2019s transfer that doing so would not be totally witless. Now for a brief London-clubs-go-shopping interlude. Arsenal have opened talks with the Paris St-Germain right-back Thomas Meunier, according to the Mail, though they are not keen on coughing up his \u00a327m asking price. Lyon\u2019s Tanguy Ndombele has issued a come-and-get-me plea to rumoured suitors Tottenham. \u201cIt\u2019s true that Tottenham are a great team and they reached the Champions League final,\u201d the 22-year-old midfielder gushed. \u201cWhich player would not be interested in a big club?\u201d West Ham have waded into the fight for the Eibar midfielder Joan Jord\u00e1n, which Sevilla had been close to concluding. And Chelsea want Frank Lampard to be their new manager, according to the same paper, but also have Ajax\u2019s Erik ten Hag, Nuno Espirito Santo of Wolves and RB Leipzig\u2019s Ralf Rangnick on their shortlist. Portuguese wonderkid Jo\u00e3o Felix might end up at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid as the club sets about spending the money they are about to land from the sale of Antoine Griezmann (for whom PSG have emerged as an unlikely alternative destination, with his switch to Barcelona not yet complete). And finally Liverpool\u2019s scouts have been in Southampton again, this time identifying Alex McCarthy as a potential second-choice goalkeeper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
