The finest intelligence services in the world have been spending zillions of dollars trying to answer that for over a decade now, and they still haven't a clue. Instead, they discovered Curveball, who fed them a tall tale of mass destruction. Add his wild Saddam yarns to the library of the absurd. I first opened that library door in 1989 when, a few weeks before the Wall came down, I went to visit Her Majesty's ambassador in East Berlin. We discussed the strains on the regime \u2013 but never, at any time, was there even a private hint of incipient collapse. What happened was as big a surprise to our man with his ear to the ground as it was to everyone else. And sheer, stupefied surprise runs through every chapter of emerging cold war history now. What did President Reagan note in his diary on 18 November 1983? \"I feel the Soviets \u2026 are so paranoid about being attacked that \u2026 we ought to tell them no one here has any intention of doing anything like that.\" Why, on 18 January 1984, did the KGB instruct its agents in Europe and the US to look out for \"mass slaughter of cattle and putting meat into cold storage\"? And how did the then deputy director of the CIA (and today's US defence secretary) Robert Gates come to wonder whether \"the Soviet leadership was so out of touch that they really believed a pre-emptive attack was a real possibility?\" (His own answer: \"US intelligence had failed to grasp the true extent of their anxiety.\") Those quotes \u2013 rehearsed in The Dead Hand by David E Hoffman \u2013 are only the tip of an iceberg of bumbling risk assessment through the 60s, 70s and 80s on both sides of the iron curtain, fermented by painfully frail espionage efforts. The CIA got it wrong time and again. It didn't \u2013 as Reagan's own musings reveal \u2013 have a single lead agent inside the Kremlin who knew what was going on. And the KGB was even worse. When Vitaly Katayev, a central committee member who kept copious notes, inspected the verdict on Reagan's star wars wheezes, he found \"lazy and passive spies who often sent along press cuttings as intelligence\". What they most feared, he concluded, \"was underestimating the seriousness of the threat, so they overestimated it\". Crying wolf was the basic response of bureaucratic ignorance \u2013 and ignorance, in turn, was the price paid for having agents so distant from seats of power that they understood perilously little about what was actually going on. Sounds familiar? There were ingrained assumptions, sure enough. The CIA knew what it was supposed to believe about Moscow expansionism (and, if it forgot, Defence Secretary Cheney was always on hand to remind it). The KGB, with Red Army generals at its back, was similarly adrift. And the winter of 1983-84 was just one of the times when the world almost died by accident. But the basic shuddering mistake was the absolute reverse of political belief (and popular fiction). James Bond wasn't on the case. George Smiley was dozing or reading the wrong paper. The CIA had got the wrong end of the stick, as usual. Those of us who shivered through the cold war were living a self-deluding lie. So back to Osama. Where's he gone? Back to a WikiLeaked Middle East? Where in any of these tens of thousands of classified documents does America's man in Cairo or Tripoli forecast freedom's wave sweeping the region? And as for Blair, Bush and Chilcot, you may choose to stick by the conclusion you first jumped to, of course: but we old cold warriors are still stuck with the number we thought of first \u2013 the cock-ups of secrecy, the imbecilities of intelligence, the curse of credulity.
