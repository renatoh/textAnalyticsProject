It is to the Northern Irishman's credit that he can adopt black humour about the topic, which in other people would trigger only deep concern. Unsurprisingly, Strathclyde police will mount a significant operation around Sunday's Old Firm match at Ibrox. Celtic would secure the Scottish Premier League title with a win, a prospect that does nothing for those in Glasgow who prefer a peaceful life. Whatever the derby outcome, it is impossible to ignore the sense that Lennon will be a prominent figure. The Celtic manager revels in the Ibrox atmosphere, one which only promises to be more intense on account of Rangers' much-publicised financial woes. Celtic's support will cross the city with goading in mind. Their hosts are expected to excel in old-fashioned belligerence, something they have long-since \u2013 and perhaps admirably \u2013 mastered. \"It will be intense and raw,\" Lennon promised. \"It will have all the ingredients of an Old Firm game you would expect, but with a little bit more riding on it than normal. I think there is going to be a huge police presence inside and outside the ground. In that respect I don't think they want me to change too much. \"I'd much rather win it [the league] at home, to tell you the truth. I'd like us to win and play well but whether we clinch it or not, we'll have plenty of time to enjoy it afterwards. We had the police up on Wednesday just reminding the players of their behaviour on the field. They've been delighted with both sets of players this season. They're just a little bit concerned about other aspects outside as opposed to inside. That's become standard with these games.\" Lennon is nonplussed about being a focal point, or subject of abuse, once again. That said, he shakes his head when asked if he would like to have played in a Glasgow derby against this, potentially combustible backdrop. \"I'd rather talk this game down than talk it up. It doesn't matter what I say, people will pick bones in it,\" Lennon added. \"I seem to evoke a lot of emotion in people by blowing my nose or looking at people the wrong the way. I want to play this game down and people can make their own mind up about my comments.\" For Lennon, the opportunity to be the first to claim a Scottish domestic treble as both a player and a manager disappeared after last weekend's surprise League Cup final loss to Kilmarnock. \"I can't let one game deter or distract from what we've achieved,\" Celtic's manager insists. \"We've played well at Dundee United. We've scored four goals in the second half there, against one of the form teams in the country. A week later we've lost a cup final, although I didn't think we played that badly.\" Celtic perhaps have a separate on-field score to settle. As part of a slow start to the season, Lennon was scathing of his players after they surrendered a half-time lead to lose at Ibrox in September. The differing fortunes of the clubs during the intervening six months could hardly be more striking. \"We've not lost a league game since 2 October,\" said Lennon. \"In that time we've drawn one and won the rest so that speaks volumes for the quality and consistency we've produced. We've done so much at our end the result at Ibrox doesn't matter. I was just really disappointed. I don't want to feel like that again. \"We didn't compete in the second half, which was very unlike us. We still weren't sure of the team at that time though. I also wasn't sure of my best team, of course. There were a few making their debuts and a few still finding their feet at the club. There's no excuses, though; we were second best in that second half. I didn't see that coming. \"There was a little bit of work to be done. Rangers were pretty strong at the time, the usual suspects out playing. I'd imagine that would be the case come Sunday. There will be more than a familiar look about them by the time the game comes round. Rangers at home are a formidable team, regardless of the personnel. They'll also have a huge support behind them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
