There are worse fates for a people than to be ruled by benevolent outsiders. Even the doyen of early 20th-century British anti-imperialists, JA Hobson, saw that. What Hobson also saw was that imperialism is an unreliable way of solving the world's problems: because it has no perceived legitimacy it is easily hijacked by special interests; it may be culturally insensitive; and is prone to atrocity even when its intentions are of the best. This is what the US/UK action in Iraq is exemplifying today. Hobson's solution to this problem was to internationalise it. OK, so the UN's record in this field is a mixed one; but in Iraq it was doing quite well. There is no evidence either from America's past interventions (postwar Germany and Japan are not true comparators), or from its present domestic culture - idealistic, yes, and with a democracy of a kind, but also ideologically blinkered (the free market), brutal (prisons) and tinged with Christian fundamentalist zealotry - to suggest that it is any better fitted than Hobson's British empire was to avoid these pitfalls. That's the problem. Bernard Porter Stockholm For Ferguson, the force that will bring the Iraqis to democracy is the US. Think of the 1940s, we are told - the restoration of democracy to Japan and Germany. Well let's also think 1950s - the US-supported dictatorships in South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere in south-east Asia. Let's think 1960s - support for dictators like Somoza of Nicaragua. Let's think 1970s - support for Pinochet. Let's think 1980s - support for the Contras to overthrow the democratic government of Nicaragua. Let's think 1990s - support for the warlords, jihadists and oppressors of women in Afghanistan. But at the heart of Ferguson's argument is the idea that the Iraqi people aren't up to running a democracy. We are told the only way they were going to get democracy \"this side of the 22nd century\" was courtesy of the US army. If the US and its allies pull out, we are likely to see \"descent into chaos\". Ferguson obviously thinks it's time we donned our pith helmets and picked up the white man's burden again. Stuart King London Ferguson says sovereignty is always limited in a world where the monopoly of economic and military right gives effectual imperial power to the monopolist. Yet in this case the monopolist is America, and what it promises by liberation of Iraq is democracy as an unalloyed sovereignty. Ferguson treats democracy as an unalloyed good, but it often comes about by means of limited sovereignty, which is destined always to be pretty limited anyway. Jonathan Lamb Newcastle upon Tyne Ferguson has a great deal to say about Iraqi democracy (or lack of it). Perhaps he has forgotten that the US does not share his passion for democracy. The US could have encouraged elections in Iraq in 1963, instead it chose to back Saddam, supplying him with arms and intelligence to help overthrow the popular nationalist leader Abdul Karim Kassem.
