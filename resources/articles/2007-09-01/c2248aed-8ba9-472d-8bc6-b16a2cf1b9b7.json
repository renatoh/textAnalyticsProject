What confidence they had for this one suffered a set-back in a final warm-up match against a Munster second string in Chicago. How they see it Six of the squad played in Australia four years ago, but there is only a sprinkling of professionals and rugby in the USA will remain amateur until next year. For now, England, South Africa, Samoa and even Tonga look like big problems. The coach Peter Thorburn, a former New Zealand A coach, was persuaded out of horse-breeding retirement to take over the Eagles. Otherwise best remembered for being saddled with taking Bristol down when the cash ran out. The captain Mike Hercus was once Charlie Hodgson's understudy at Sale and a clever fly-half with Llanelli and Newport-Gwent Dragons. Will make the best use of ball won by his improving forwards. The linchpin Full-back Francois Viljoen would have made it seven 2003 veterans, but damaged knee ligaments in training. However, there is valuable experience in the pack where Mike MacDonald was one of the stars of Leeds's promotion last season. How they'll play If the loss to Munster was a blow, it did show the Eagles pack has potential, even if the backs were a little naive. But a third World Cup victory will probably have to wait, even though the record against Tonga is played two, won one. Key fact Scrum-half Chad Erskine, a fluent speaker of Zulu, played polo for South Africa as a schoolboy. Omen In 2003 they beat Japan on the holy day of St Frumentius, who introduced Christianity to Ethiopia. This bodes well for the Tonga game on September 12 - Ethiopian National Revolution Day.
