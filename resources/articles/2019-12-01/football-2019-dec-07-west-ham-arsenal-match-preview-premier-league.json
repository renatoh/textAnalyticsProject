Put simply this is relegation form. The club must find a permanent replacement for Unai Emery \u2013 crucially not Freddie Ljungberg \u2013 quickly to turn things around. West Ham reverted to type after beating Chelsea but the spiralling atomic nightmare that is Arsenal should provide a chance for Manuel Pellegrini to rebound once again. Michail Antonio\u2019s fitness, or lack thereof, could be crucial to their chances.
