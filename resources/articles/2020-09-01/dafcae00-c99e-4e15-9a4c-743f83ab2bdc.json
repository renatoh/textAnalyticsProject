The 87-year-old, who ran track and field for 16 years and was also a powerful figure at the International Olympic Committee, was sentenced to four years in prison \u2013 two of which have been suspended \u2013 and fined \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3455,000). Five other senior figures in the sport, including the president\u2019s son, Papa Massata Diack, were also given jail sentences for their part in an extraordinary scheme dubbed \u201cfull protection\u201d \u2013 in which 23 Russian athletes had their doping sanctions secretly waived in exchange for payments from \u20ac100,000-\u20ac600,000. Diack sat impassively in front of the chief judge Rose-Marie Hunault as she read out the guilty verdict and detailed how he had squeezed Russian athletes suspected of doping of about \u20ac3.2m in hush money. \u201cThe money was paid in exchange for a program of \u2018full protection\u2019,\u201d she said, adding the scheme allowed athletes who should have been suspended \u201cpurely and simply to escape sanctions. You violated the rules of the game.\u201d However the judge said Diack was unlikely to go to jail. \u201cGiven your age you can expect conditional release,\u201d she added. Diack Sr said he would immediately appeal. Papa Massata Diack, who was tried in absentia because Senegal refuses to extradite him, was sentenced to five years in prison and fined \u20ac1m. He was also banned from sport for 10 years. The judge said $15m was funnelled to the younger Diack\u2019s companies, including commissions and money creamed off contracts and the sale of TV rights while his father was president of what was then the International Association of Athletics Federations, which has since been rebranded as World Athletics. The judge said the Diacks worked together in diverting funds, telling Lamine Diack that there was \u201can understanding between you and your son\u201d. Massata Diack said he would also appeal, telling the Guardian: \u201cI am appealing their stupid decision. My lawyers were not there in June because of Covid 19. This trial was a joke.\u201d The case marks the end of a six-year investigation into Russian doping and bribes that began in December 2014 when the French newspaper L\u2019\u00c9quipe revealed that senior figures in the IAAF had extorted money from the Russian marathon runner Liliya Shobukhova. That led to Diack Jr and Balakhnichev stepping down from their IAAF positions and shortly afterwards the Guardian also revealed that Gabriel Doll\u00e9 had left his post as the medical and anti-doping director because of the Shobukhova case. According to French prosecutors, the \u201cfull protection\u201d scheme was first suggested by Lamine Diack at a meeting with the then Russian sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, in November 2011. Diack Sr then directly or indirectly solicited \u00a33.1m from athletes to conceal their offences so they could continue competing. It was also alleged that Diack Sr was involved in a $1.5m (\u00a31.15m) payment from Russia to finance election campaigns in Senegal in 2012, in exchange for slowing down doping cases targeting Russian athletes. Another of those found guilty on corruption charges was the former IAAF treasurer Valentin Balakhnichev, who was also tried in his absence. The court handed the Russian a three-year jail term and said money would be confiscated from his account in Monaco, where World Athletics is based. Doll\u00e9 was handed a two-year suspended jail term and fined \u20ac140,000 for taking money to slow down doping sanctions. Also found guilty were the lawyer Habib Ciss\u00e9, who served as Diack\u2019s legal counsel and was said by the judge to have played an \u201cessential role\u201d in corruption under Diack, and the Russian coach Alexei Melnikov, who was tried and sentenced in his absence. The Paris criminal court also decided to award World Athletics \u20ac16m for embezzled funds and for reputational damage suffered as a direct consequence of these crimes and the resulting media coverage. In a statement World Athletics said it would do \u201ceverything we can to recover the monies awarded, and return them to the organisation for the development of athletics globally. Whilst we are disappointed this happened in our sport, we are grateful for the strong and clear decisions that have been taken against the individuals involved and charged with these crimes, and we would like to reassure everyone that the reforms our Congress approved in 2016 will ensure that similar actions by individuals can never happen again in our sport.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
