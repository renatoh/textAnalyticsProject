Reading's draw with Brentford, which secured promotion, and Norwich's failure to beat Birmingham City in the play-off final meant the teams were both in the First Division, but you would hardly have known it from last night's display. Norwich have grown in stature since that defeat in Cardiff and with the visit of Portsmouth awaiting them at the weekend, they took it easy in the second half. Superior in every area, Nigel Worthington has got Norwich playing football worthy of a shot at the top flight. Reading, after a bright start to life at this level after three seasons in the second division, have now lost three games in a row. Two goals in the first five minutes suggested Norwich did not want to waste too much energy on anything as inconvenient as a contest. Taking advantage of uncertainty in the Reading defence Paul McVeigh opened the scoring in the second minute. Iwan Roberts crossed from the right, Upson missed a vital clearance and McVeigh tapped in his seventh goal of the season. Three minutes later Norwich doubled their advantage when Phil Mulryne received the ball from McVeigh just inside the area and curled the ball into the top corner. Reading struggled to cause much of a threat, their strikers isolated by a midfield lacking movement or invention. Tony Rougier fired wide of the post after turning Darren Kenton and then heading wide at the back post from an Andy Hughes cross. Reading's hopes took an other blow when captain John Mackie was sent off five minutes from half-time for a second bookable offence. After being harshly adjudged to have handled early on, Mackie was booked for protesting and a late challenge on McVeigh brought a red card. Rougier had a chance again at the start of the second half, turning neatly but hesitating when he should have shot, allowing Norwich to recover. Reading were boosted and made more of a contest of it, but their top scorer Jamie Cureton was anonymous on his first appearance against the team he left six years ago and was withdrawn. But Norwich always looked in control, passing the ball around neatly and protecting their advantage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
