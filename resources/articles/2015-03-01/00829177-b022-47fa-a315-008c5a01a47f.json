The authors of the joint report by NatCen Social Research and Essex University warn the Conservatives that the findings suggest they would be wise to ensure that they are not depicted by their opponents as hostile to public services. The report is published as the Labour party intensifies its warning about \u201cextreme\u201d Tory spending cuts with the release of a poster of an X-ray of a broken leg saying: \u201cNext time, they\u2019ll cut to the bone.\u201d Dr John Bartle, of Essex University, suggests that the Tories would do well to counter the Labour line of attack. \u201cThe general leftward shift that has taken place since the last general election suggests that arguments about the need to shrink the state, reduce waste and cut income taxes will have less traction than in 2010.\u201d The new analysis found that in an assessment of the \u201cpolicy mood\u201d from answers to hundreds of different survey questions, voters have moved to the left in the last five years. A score of 50 means that the nation is \u201cdead centre in its political attitudes\u201d. Britain veered towards 45 at the time of the last election and is now heading towards 50, which counts as a move towards the left. The report\u2019s authors caution against assuming that British voters are on the verge of becoming socialist, voting Labour or for the Greens \u2013 who are placing themselves to the left of Labour. They add that the series, which started in the early 1960s, found that voters tend to react against whichever party is in power. The authors write: \u201cThe coincidence of these movements with changes of government in turn suggests that the electorate tended to move in the opposite direction to government policy. It is as if the policy mood was a thermostat: signalling the need to cool things when they get \u2018too hot\u2019 under Labour by supporting less government activity \u2013 less spending, less welfare and less regulation. The mood falls to the right. \u201cEqually, when things get \u2018too cold\u2019 under the Conservatives, the electorate signal their preference for warmer policy \u2013 more spending, more generous welfare and more regulation. The mood increases to the left.\u201d The report says it would be wrong to make predictions for the election on the basis of the findings. But it suggests that Labour\u2019s message about the need not to shrink the state should penetrate, while the Tories need to be careful. It says: \u201cCompared with 2010, Labour\u2019s basic political message \u2013 that the government should not retreat too much or too quickly \u2013 should have more traction. Conservative arguments about the need to shrink the state should have correspondingly less traction. Much now depends on the position staked out by the parties and the \u2018tone\u2019 of their campaigns. \u201cThe coalition government\u2019s autumn statement \u2013 essentially the first draft of the Conservative election manifesto \u2013 advocated a massive reduction in state activity, returning public spending to levels not seen since the 1930s. If Labour now stakes out a position at the centre, many centrist voters \u2013 particularly former Liberal Democrats \u2013 may be pushed back to Labour.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
