This is not surprising. Postwar re-evaluation of his operas has shown him to be the great explorer of sleaze. He reveals the hidden agendas, personal motivations and the double dealing that hover behind the surfaces of power. As we lurch towards the election, the cry goes up that we can't trust politicians any more. Handel frequently reminds us why. Partenope, first performed in 1730, is one of his most ambivalent scores. In addition to examining the cut and thrust of political intrigue, it also forms a comic, lubricious meditation on the uncontrollable nature of sexual desire. Partenope was the mythic founder of Naples. Handel turns her into a bit of a goer, casually playing a couple of lovers off against each other, and dragging her country into war to get rid of the unwanted attentions of a third. Things get complex when a fourth bloke, ostensibly called Eurimene, turns up. Eurimene, real name Rosmira, is actually a woman in drag, hell bent on reclaiming Arsace, who has ditched her in order to become Partenope's toy-boy general. The principal flaw with the Early Opera Company's production is that power is frequently emphasised at the expense of eroticism. Netia Jones's set is a boardroom-cum-building site office in which Jeni Bern's Partenope doles out political and sexual favours. Apart from Diana Moore's nerdy, besuited Armindo (one of Partenope's chaps), the rest of the cast look fetching in combat gear, although we're forcefully reminded of the original purpose of fatigues when we get to the battle scenes. The sexual humour, when it comes, seems to consist in getting Arsace's trousers off. Elsewhere, a glacial chill emanates from the whole, which is often neither sexy, nor acerbic, nor funny enough. Musically, things are a bit jittery, the result, one suspects, of the withdrawal of Antonia Sotgiu (originally cast as Rosmira). Louise Mott sings the role with considerable bravado from the pit, while one of the company's stage managers, Natalie Hobday, acts it on stage. The other singers struggle occasionally with some of Handel's more florid vocal writing, though Bern is a sensual Partenope, Moore reveals a fine, beautifully focused alto, and William Purefoy's Arsace is handsomely athletic. Stephen Rooke's Emilio, the paragliding foreign interloper, nearly steals the show. Christian Curnyn's conducting is clean rather than sensuous. The Linbury Studio's dry acoustic helps nobody.
