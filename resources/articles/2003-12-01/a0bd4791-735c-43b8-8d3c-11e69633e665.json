A highly promising juvenile hurdler until his career was cut short by injury, Tom Paddington (2.20) was nursed back to health to win on the Flat before picking up the thread over timber at Newbury last month. The eight-year-old was brought with a well-timed challenge when beating Sud Bleu and can confirm the placings with the runner-up on 5lb worse terms. Sud Bleu may have benefited from a wind operation, but he often flatters to deceive. Sandown scorer Overstrand has taken a sharp rise in the weights, and a bigger danger could be Saintsaire, who is expected to come on a good deal for his Newbury run. Ascot 1.15: Just 2lb higher than when successful on his penultimate start, Cenkos should be able to give weight to all these bar Got One Too , who must be considered well treated after coming home 18 lengths clear at Cheltenham last Saturday - he looked to have the measure of closest pursuer Santenay when the latter fell two out. Newcastle 1.35: Last seen finishing third to Persian Punch in the Jockey Club Cup at Newmarket, Kasthari , a 95,000gns purchase, should outclass this opposition granted a clear round. Ascot 1.45: Horus was a creditable second to Kingscliff here last time and looks the one Impek has to beat. The latter, best going right-handed, proved suited by the step up to three miles at Sandown. A smart novice last season, he looks sure to win more races. Warwick 1.55: Tik-A-Tai and Bob Ar Aghaidh receive plenty of weight from Mughas , but Alan King's four-year-old is on a roll and can stay a step ahead of the handicapper. Newcastle 2.10: One of the few runners here in any worthwhile form at present, Great As Gold is hard to oppose. Warwick 2.30: This has the makings of a good day for Alan King, whose recent course winner d'Argent looks a useful recruit to chasing. Newcastle 2.45: After looking ill at ease over the Grand National fences, Royal Beluga bounced back to form at Doncaster. He can follow up. Warwick 3.05: Fourth in a stronger race than this at Newbury last time, Spring Grove should give a good account . Newcastle 3.20: This is little better than a seller. Gilfoot Breeze should go close if putting his best foot forward. Warwick 3.35: In-form trainer King has high hopes for Emanic , a dual bumper winner in France when trained by Guillaume Macaire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
