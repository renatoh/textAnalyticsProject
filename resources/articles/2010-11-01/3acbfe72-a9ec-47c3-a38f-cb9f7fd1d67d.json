After all those long-suffering years of being down the pecking order behind Leeds (parading about in Europe) or Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, Hull, Bradford \u2013 even Barnsley had their spell in the Premier League \u2013 it's now Doncaster's turn. Seventh in the Championship and pushing for the play-offs, while so many of their local rivals flounder. It is a long way from those dark days 10 years ago in the Conference, when the then-chairman Ken Richardson almost drove the club into the ground. Having already served time in 1984 for switching horses in a race at Leicester, in 1999 Richardson was again convicted and sent to prison \u2013 this time for attempting to burn down Doncaster's old ground at Belle Vue. The memories send a shudder through the fans. Outside the Keepmoat Stadium, Eric Wheatley, who along with his wife, Margaret, has been selling matchday programmes at Doncaster for 35 years, casts his mind back. \"There were times we thought we'd pack up and that would be it,\" he says. \"Those were the worst times, with Richardson, without a doubt. It was like the mafia with him. We thought it might be the end.\" Margaret is sheltering in one of the new booths the club has provided, selling through the window, a cold wind whipping outside. Everyone knows the couple and approaches with a cheery hello. . When the club were relegated from the Football League in 1998, fans carried a coffin to the final home game. Their recovery since is like something out of a fairytale. \"We're doing lovely now though, aren't we?\" says Margaret. \"Compared to what it used to be like when we were struggling. This is the best we've ever been. You walk around the town and you see plenty of shirts and scarves, you never used to see that.\" Despite Doncaster's recent success, the Wheatleys say programme sales have dropped off this season, with the town being hard hit by the recession. In response, the board have been quick to offer cut-price tickets. The new chairman, John Ryan, has worked hard to rebuild a relationship with the community, with the chief executive, Dave Morris, explaining how working with local schools has helped grow crowds from a pitiful 1,000 a decade ago to a record number at the Keepmoat yesterday. \"All our hard work is coming to fruition. Kids are growing up and identifying with Rovers, where in the past they would have drifted away to more successful clubs in Sheffield and Leeds and Hull.\" Morris believes that stability has been key to success on the pitch, with just two managers \u2013 Dave Penney, and now Sean O'Driscoll \u2013 in 10 years. O'Driscoll's team took an early lead through James Hayter and initially shone against aspiring Swansea. But a superb strike from the full back Angel Rangel in the 90th minute split the points \u2013 and the harmony within the Rovers ranks. While the home crowd shouted for offside, O'Driscoll appeared to blame his goalkeeper, Neil Sullivan, and after the final whistle gathered his team on the pitch for a public hanging. After receiving a point-blank dressing-down, Sullivan responded by walking off in a rage. \"Nothing to do with the game,\" said O'Driscoll. \"We were warming down, we were discussing the game.\" Was the goal Sullivan's fault? \"I never blame players,\" he said. Was it offside? \"I couldn't see. I was 40 yards away.\" The disappointment on O'Driscoll's face was there for all to see, although he conceded that \"one goal wouldn't have been enough\" against a quality side like Swansea."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
