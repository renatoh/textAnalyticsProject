Mr Ahern said that while he welcomed last night's new declaration on weapons - signalling the intention of the IRA to resume talks with the independent weapons decommissioning body - it was \"only a step\". Mr Ahern, who had discussions on the current Northern Ireland position in London yesterday with the prime minister, Tony Blair, called on the IRA to place their proposal for decommissioning \"back on the table\". He added: \"It's not enough in terms of bringing us back to where we were last month. While the statement is progress, and a step in the right direction, it is only a step, and we have to keep going.\" Mr Trimble met today with the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, at Stormont. A UUP spokesman said the meeting lasted for around 50 minutes, but he refused to comment on the content of their discussions. Later Mr Trimble declared republicans no longer have any credibility among unionists and insisted the IRA must act to settle the decommissioning issue. Failure by the Provisionals to disarm after the Weston Park talks and the furore over the three Irish men being held in Colombia have dealt severe blows to public confidence, the UUP leader claimed. He said: \"If the political process is to continue as it is, then republicans must act now to create the necessary credibility.\" Mr Trimble could be forced to collapse the Northern Ireland executive if the government proceeds with another one day suspension of the assembly. Ulster Unionist sources urged Mr Trimble to \"get tough\" if there was no IRA disarmament by midnight on Saturday and London and Dublin resisted their demand to deep freeze the institutions. The withdrawal of the UUP's three ministers would create a serious crisis in the assembly, with the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists likely to follow. Hardline Ulster Unionist MP Jeffrey Donaldson last night warned in the absence of any move on IRA disarmament by Saturday, the party would not tolerate anything other than long term suspension. \"After events in Colombia and the United States, the UUP must stand up for the democratic process and in the event of a one-day suspension must withdraw from that executive, denying the representatives of terror a place in government,\" he said. Sinn Fein national chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said Mr Donaldson's comments proved the UUP was now an anti-Agreement party. \"If the Ulster Unionists insist on collapsing the political institutions, the two governments - especially the British government - must make it clear that they intend to implement all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement irrespective of whether the assembly and the executive are still in operation.\" Sean Farren, of the nationalist SDLP, said the failure of the IRA to disarm has undermined confidence in the political process. He said: \"It is now two years since the IRA first agreed to engage with General de Chastelain and his commission. Since then progress towards decommissioning has been almost imperceptible.\" But Sinn Fein chief whip Alex Maskey insisted the IRA statement was very significant. \"The IRA have made a statement in which they are saying they will actively intensify their engagement with General de Chastelain and his commission and I think that is critically important.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
