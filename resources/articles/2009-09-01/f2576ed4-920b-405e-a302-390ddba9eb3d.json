Fernando Torres's performance here confirmed that he is someone special and Rafael Ben\u00edtez was so enraptured that he praised his striker for being, among other things, \"a good husband\". \"He is a good professional with a great mentality,\" said Ben\u00edtez before adding, with a chuckle: \"He is also a good husband \u2013 so sorry, women.\" The two Spaniards' tiff on the opening day of the season seems to have been resolved. Then, Ben\u00edtez had criticised Torres for brooding through a defeat at Tottenham Hotspur, and ordered him to stop complaining about rugged opponents and to concentrate on beating them instead. Evidently, the striker listened. He opened the scoring here by dodging and dashing past James Tomkins and Matthew Upson before jabbing the ball past Robert Green at the near post. Then, in the 75th minute, he leapt above two defenders to meet Ryan Babel's cross and send a downward header into the net. The two goals brought his tally since joining Liverpool for a club-record \u00a326.5m in July 2007 to 55 in 91 matches. Ben\u00edtez had staked his reputation on that purchase. \"When you look at what some managers pay for just anybody, Torres was very cheap,\" said the Spaniard, happily overlooking some of his own less successful purchases. \"We were looking for someone with the qualities you need to play in England. Torres was the perfect answer. He is always trying to be in good positions and has very good movement. He has pace and mobility and even though he has scored a lot of goals he always wants to score more and remain an important player for us.\" Remaining an important player obviously means remaining fit and Ben\u00edtez admitted that the striker's hectic schedule with Spain over the last year means the club has to maintain constant vigilance to ensure he does not fall prey to exhaustion, something the manager now admits may have hampered him earlier in the season. \"The rest of the players had been training for 19 days [by the time Liverpool's Spanish contingent returned from the Confederations Cup] so we needed to protect them. We pushed Torres a little bit because he was top scorer but we are now working very hard on prevention. We are taking good care of him.\" Liverpool will certainly need Torres to prolong his prolific form if their defence continues to creak. West Ham exposed frailties that, having been apparent in the defeats by Tottenham and Aston Villa and even in the 3-2 victory at Bolton, are beginning to look chronic. Much has been made of the rough treatment dished out to Fernando Torres this season, but against West Ham El Ni\u00f1o gave away twice as many free-kicks as he won. Zavon Hines, by contrast, was fouled on seven separate occasions. In terms of goals, though, Torres was well ahead Beyond the lack of pace highlighted by West Ham's impressive young winger Zavon Hines, Liverpool were simply sloppy. Jamie Carragher and Martin Skrtel were booked after being caught dithering on the ball. Carragher's recklessness conceded the penalty from which Alessandro Diamanti scored his first West Ham goalrecalled Steven Gerrard's wild tackle on Nigel Reo-Coker that had gifted Aston Villa a penalty at Anfield. After Dirk Kuyt had put Liverpool back in front, Carlton Cole became the latest beneficiary of Liverpool's slack marking at set pieces by heading in a Mark Noble corner. Ben\u00edtez, who is normally one of the Premier League's perfectionists, professed to being unperturbed by these failings. \"They are just individual errors,\" he said. \"Carra, Skrtel, the players, they know they have to focus more.\" Ben\u00edtez rejects the notion that he is accepting greater defensive vulnerability in order to maximise offensive power. \"My approach has not changed. In my second year here [2005-06] we got a club-record 82 points. Two years ago we scored over 130 goals and last year we scored more than anyone else, so it is not a question of attacking more. What has changed is that now we have more quality. But we still have the balance.\" Gianfranco Zola hopes he too may soon be able to field a balanced team. The performance of Hines and Diamanti, and the recruitment of the Mexican striker Guillermo Franco, have left the Italian feeling, for the first time, that he has options. \"I normally like to play with one striker and two small ones behind him but since the start of the season we have had to change all the time because of injures or players leaving,\" he said. \"Now at least I know who I am working with so I can start creating a shape and putting in more of my ideas.\"Rafael Ben\u00edtez: Selection: Pushed Gerrard further forward to bring Lucas back alongside Mascherano. Had strong bench Tactics: Persisted with two holding midfielder as full-backs had licence to fly forward in support of Torres, Gerrard, Kuyt and Benayoun. Gamechanging: Introduced the speedy Ryan Babel to run at the tiring Herita Ilunga Zola Tactics: Invited Liverpool forward in order to use pace and power on the counter-attack. Gianfranco Zola: Selection: Handed full debut to Allesandro Diamanti and second start to Zavon Hines. Gamechanging: Forced to make two first-half substitutions after Matt Upson and Valon Behrami suffered injuries. Player up: Hines \u2014 Zola hailed the 20-year-old's \"brave attitude\" after watching him wreak havoc in the Liverpool defence with his speed and trickery. Also tracked back diligently when his team were under pressure. Player down: Carragher \u2014 The veteran's sluggishness was repeatedly exploited by more vibrant opponents in a display that compounded recent jitters. Too early to conclude he is over the hill, but he does look like he could do with a rest. Suspensions: None Key moment: 75th min \u2014 A perfect cross by Babel brought a perfect header from Torres to give Liverpool maximum points after an imperfect performance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
