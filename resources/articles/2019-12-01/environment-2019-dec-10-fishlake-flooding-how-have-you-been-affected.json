One of the heavily affected areas was Fishlake in Doncaster, where recovery work is still underway to clean up the aftermath of the floods. While over 100 homes were damaged, it\u2019s believed that many residents are still living in temporary accommodation.

One of our reporters is heading back to Fishlake to find out how people have been affected. How to get in touch Was your home or business flooded? Are you still in temporary accommodation?
