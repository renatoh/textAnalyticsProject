It has also been taken up by his former club, Leicester, as they achieved their first meaningful home victory of the season at a point in the campaign when they are usually defending an unbeaten ground record. They had been brittle in front of their own supporters but after Ulster led three times in the first half, at no stage for very long, the Tigers took control at forward. When Ben Youngs came on towards the end of the third quarter, the England scrum-half lifted the tempo and sharpened his side's focus. \"This was the old Tigers,\" said the Leicester director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, who, showing how wacky sport can be, was asked whether he thought he was in line to succeed Johnson, just a few weeks after he himself had been tipped for the sack. \"We did just enough and left a good side with nowhere to go.\" The talk was mostly about Johnson, not least whether he would return to the club at which he spent his playing career, and who would replace him. \"That job is far too soon for me,\" said Cockerill. \"There are better qualified people than me around, like Jim Mallinder and Toby Booth.\" Had Johnson been at the ground in the new stand on Saturday, he would have been hard to spot: that side of the pitch was draped in a swirl of mist all match, as if the members of an appreciation society devoted to Winston Churchill had lit up fat cigars in his honour. \"Martin will always be welcome here,\" said Cockerill. He was asked whether, if he would not be replacing Johnson, the former England coach could take over from him at some point. Coaching seems to be less a merry-go-round than a Nascar race, a question of who walks free of the wreckage unscathed. \"There is nowhere for him to come in a managerial or coaching capacity at the moment and I think he needs to take some time away from the game at the moment,\" Cockerill said. Six of the Leicester squad were in New Zealand with Johnson for England's World Cup campaign, and most can expect to be retained by the new national management. \"It was disappointing to lose Johnno,\" said the flanker Tom Croft. \"He did not leave in disgrace. We are the Six Nations champions and we made the World Cup quarter-finals.\" Croft said that with little more than two months before the start of the Six Nations, the players would need to offer a lead. \"We have the players capable of heads-up rugby. We showed that against Australia a year ago and in other matches. Some things did not quite work in the World Cup, but we have to push our case forward and say this is how we want to play. There is not much time and we have to take a lead.\" There was something of Johnson in Leicester's display: they were not easy on the eye \u2013 their one try came from a chip to the line. Ulster showed slightly greater invention in a match dominated by the defences, only to be let down by some stray kicking out of hand, but the Tigers generally made the right decisions at crucial moments. It was a fitting tribute to a man revered here, but England will need more, far more.
