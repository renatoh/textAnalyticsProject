A spokeswoman at the Madrid headquarters of the national police force said the grenade carried a small amount of explosive. There were no reported injuries. \u201cStaff at the centre found a suspicious object in the centre\u2019s patio between 8.30 and 9 this morning,\u201d she said. \u201cSpecialist officers from the national police force attended and evacuated the children to a safe area. Bomb squad officers detonated the object, which was determined to be a practice grenade with little charge, which had been thrown into the centre\u2019s grounds in a bag from outside.\u201d The reception centre, in the Hortaleza neighbourhood, recently made headlines after it was singled out by Santiago Abascal, the leader of the far-right Vox party. Abascal, who lives in Hortaleza, said the centre and its residents \u2013 many of whom are from north and sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 had left many local people feeling unsafe. \u201cI live in a working-class Madrid neighbourhood \u2013 Hortaleza,\u201d he said during an election debate last month. \u201cAnd every time I\u2019m on the street \u2013 and there\u2019s a centre for unaccompanied foreign minors there \u2013 I run into women who come and tell me that the police tell them not to wear their jewellery on the street; and mothers who are worried that their daughters are coming home late and are scared of being assaulted.\u201d Unaccompanied foreign minors \u2013 known by the Spanish acronym menas \u2013were also targeted by Roc\u00edo Monasterio, Vox\u2019s leader in Madrid, who called them \u201ca serious problem in our neighbourhoods\u201d. Wednesday\u2019s attack was not the first time that children at the centre have been targeted. In the fortnight before the election, on 10 November, some of them were beaten with oars and clubs. Adriana Lastra, the vice-secretary general of the ruling Socialist party, said that words had consequences. \u201cThis is what hate speech brings,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt needs to be fought online, on the streets and in our institutions.\u201d Vox also condemned the attack. But in a statement, it accused its opponents of trying to make political capital out of Wednesday\u2019s events. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that violence \u2013 which is never justified \u2013 should be used for political ends,\u201d it said. \u201cWe await the conclusions of the investigation by state security forces.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
