The mere facts, whatever they may turn out to be, and the obvious consequences for his family render other considerations less than immediately relevant. Inevitably, however, the question raises itself: what will his team do now? Speed's influence on the fortunes of the Wales squad since accepting the job of manager was so obviously beneficial that it is hard to imagine anyone from a thin field of candidates stepping in and taking over without disrupting the distinct but possibly fragile progress made in the past year. No doubt the emotional weight of his memory will carry the players through their next match or two, as they think ahead to next autumn's qualifying campaign for the 2014 World Cup, but by the time those competitive fixtures come around they will be needing the sort of guidance with which he helped them win four of their last five matches. When they beat Norway 4-1 in Cardiff recently, there was an obvious comparison to be made with the performances of their compatriots during the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. Both squads seemed to have been regenerated by a willingness to select young players, and by the ability of those young players to set benchmarks of enthusiasm and professionalism that recalibrated the behaviour and commitment of some of the senior members of their respective squads. Warren Gatland took command of the rugby team in December 2007, during a period of turmoil. Nothing special there, given that only those whose memories go back three decades can remember a time when the representatives of Welsh rugby were not in some degree of actual or incipient chaos. Two years before Gatland arrived, Mike Ruddock had delivered a grand slam; it was their first since 1978, but a few of the senior players felt that Ruddock was receiving too much credit for work done by Graham Henry and Steve Hansen between 1998 and 2004. Those players embarked on a campaign of sustained troublemaking that led, astonishingly, to the head coach's resignation during the next Six Nations tournament. Ruddock was the Vicente del Bosque of Welsh rugby: a calm, charisma-free figure whose virtues were apparent only once he had gone, taking with him his 65% winning record, the best for any full-time Wales coach since John Dawes in the golden 1970s. Gareth Jenkins, Ruddock's highly rated successor, never managed to get on top of the dressing-room cabal, and won only six of 20 matches. After the debacle of the 2007 World Cup, he gave way to Gatland, another New Zealander, who was allowed to cleanse the Augean stables. Ruthlessly eliminating the danger of continued disruption straight away, Gatland won a grand slam in 2008 and started to introduce a generation of younger players. These are the ones who, in an eye-opening reversal of the way things are normally done, set the tone for their seniors in New Zealand. All being well for Wales, the next four years will see the fruit ripen. Speed did not face quite as big a problem in the dressing room, but he did have decades of unrelieved failure to deal with. His predecessor, John Toshack, had begun to replace the older players, but it was the new man who made the generation of Aaron Ramsey and Gareth Bale the foundation of his plans. And just as Gatland found a brilliant 22-year-old captain in Sam Warburton, whose personal qualities enabled him to command the respect of the senior players, so Speed successfully invested his faith in the 20-year-old Ramsey. These two precociously mature young skippers could be holding down their jobs for the next decade. When Speed's players come together again to represent their country, it will be hard for the younger ones in particular to cope with the absence of a manager they so greatly admired. Whatever they achieve, he will not be around to see it. But he will remain in the memory as a man who knew that in sport, when all else fails, there is nothing to lose and potentially everything to gain by putting your trust in youth. Rose replaces the racers Patrick Head, the designer of the Williams cars that took Alan Jones, Keke Rosberg, Nelson Piquet, Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve to the Formula One world championship, let it be known at the weekend that he is stepping aside. Now 65, he will not be seen at the circuits next season. On the same day, the Sunday Times reported that Sir Stuart Rose, the former chief executive of Marks and Spencer, is the candidate favoured by CVC Capital Partners, the private equity group that owns Formula One's commercial rights, to take over from Bernie Ecclestone when the 81-year-old ringmaster finally calls it a day. For all I know, Sir Stuart spent his childhood playing with a Scalextric set and sticking photographs of Vanwalls and Maseratis on his bedroom wall. But Ecclestone won a few Formula Three races in his youth, and his mate Max Mosley got as far as Formula Two. Like Head, whose father competed in post-war sports car events, they came into Formula One as real racers. And whatever one thinks of the way Ecclestone and Mosley exploited their control of the sport, there is something dispiriting about the thought of them being replaced by a suit. RFU got something right Martyn Thomas and his colleagues may have presided over the turning of English rugby's governing body into an international joke, but for the life of me I cannot see why they should be deprived of their Christmas bonuses. On Monday the Rugby Football Union's outgoing grand panjandrum pointed out that his current contract is only for six months, which may mean that he is not entitled to the reported extra \u00a3250,000 for his part in creating a record profit of \u00a38.7m for the governing body in the most recent financial year. We have yet to hear from the other senior executives, whose identities and likely bonuses remain undisclosed, although it seems probable that Rob Andrew is among them. But whatever the degree of incompetence with which they handled the affairs of the national team, they certainly did their job on the commercial side. If their contracts say that they are due specific rewards as a result, they should get them. However sickening it might seem. richard.williams@theguardian.com \u2022 This article was amended on 2 December 2011.
