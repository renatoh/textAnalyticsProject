The winner is set to bid for a valuable sales race herself after her come-from-behind half-length victory, which gave her trainer his ninth juvenile success of 2002. \"I have got her in the Tattersalls Sales race at the Curragh and I think she will probably go,\" Ryan said. \"It is worth a crack and she will have a sporting chance. She has got ability, she is tough and I was quite impressed with her today - the first two came well clear.\" Ryan said: \"With a decent [high] draw Miss Mirasol would have a good chance - she is by far the best two-year-old I have run so far. \"My two-year-olds are good this year and I have got more of them than before.\" Kieren Fallon's flying visit to Leicester paid off as he scored on African Spur in the Tommy Hardman 'A Lifetime In Racing' Selling Stakes, his only ride of the afternoon. Captain's Log delighted Michael Bell as he gained the 10th victory of his career with a half-length defeat of Linus in the Ian Beighton Birthday Claiming Stakes. \"He is a bit long in the tooth but he has earned his corn on the course and on the gallops,\" the trainer said of his seven-year-old. \"He leads the gallops and he is a very amenable horse.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
