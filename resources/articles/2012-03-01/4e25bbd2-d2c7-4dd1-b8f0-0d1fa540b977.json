If he is not successful in his application for the job, for which he was interviewed on Thursday, he will revert to his old job as head of elite player development \u2013 and that means he could be involved in England's summer tour, which includes three Tests against the Springboks. \"As Saxons coach, I could end up coaching the midweek side in South Africa,\" he confirmed. \"You never know, but, certainly, I'll be in South Africa somewhere. I'll be at the Under-20 World Cup if I'm not with the seniors. I think most people will be in South Africa this summer.\" Including, no doubt, his rival for the England role, the South African Nick Mallett. By then, we should know which of the two has convinced Ian Ritchie, the RFU's recently appointed chief executive. It is not inconceivable that both men are appointed to some sort of role within the senior set-up, or even that no one is until after the summer \u2013 in which case, Lancaster would continue as interim coach for the tour. It has been interesting to listen to Lancaster over the past few weeks discuss the summer tour and England's future generally in that matter-of-fact way of his, as if the job were his for keeps. \"That is the mindset I have,\" he agreed. \"It's not from a personal point of view but because it is simply impossible for anybody else to make the plans. It's part of my nature. I always try to plan ahead. It would be unfair to the players not to have a vision for the future. That is how I have approached it.\" In between the three Tests, in Durban, Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth from 9 June, there will be two midweek games for England. South Africa have not yet confirmed the identity of the opposition, but they are likely to be development or invitational teams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
