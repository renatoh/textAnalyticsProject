This first speech on Cuban soil by a US president in almost 90 years will be the highlight of a three-day trip that also includes a bilateral summit with Ra\u00fal Castro, a joint news conference, a private meeting with dissidents, a baseball game and a moment to pay homage to the Catholic church for helping broker talks that led to the opening of relations in September. Obama, who will travel with his wife Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha, will be the first US president to visit Havana since Calvin Coolidge in 1928. The trip is the culmination of a process that began with a historic joint announcement on 17 December 2014 when the leaders came together to signal their intention to begin dismantling the cold war-era embargo. US officials are hopeful that Obama\u2019s speech next Tuesday will be broadcast live on Cuban national television but have not yet been provided any guarantees of this. Obama will be under pressure to demonstrate that his decision to open relations is helping to encourage political reforms. He met this week with prominent Cuban Americans to listen to their hopes and concerns about the visit. He is also taking a number of corporate leaders with him on a trip that is expected to mark a bonanza for US business and the start of up to 50 direct flights a day between the two countries. Obama is expected to use his speech to call for civil rights improvements, but he will signal that the US no longer seeks to oust the Castro regime. White House national security adviser Ben Rhodes said the US administration hoped the trip would \u201cmake the process of normalization permanent and irreversible\u201d before Obama leaves office next January but also lead to a speeding up of reform on the Cuban side. \u201cWe recognise this speech is very important to the Cuban people \u2013 as important as anything he is doing while he is there,\u201d added Rhodes. \u201cHe will want to acknowledge the complicated history between our two countries.\u201d Obama will not be seeking to \u201cdictate outcomes\u201d however, said the White House, acknowledging that past calls for democracy had sounding like attempts at \u201cregime change\u201d. \u201cWe believe that by opening up space we can help empower the Cuban people to live better lives.\u201d The Obamas will arrive on Sunday night and travel to the Cathedral in Old Havana to meet with Cardinal Ortega, the archbishop of Havana, who was instrumental along with Pope Francis in helping forge the 17 December agreement to begin to normalise relations between the two countries. The cold war embargo between the US and Cuba had been in place since 1962 and the Cuban missile crisis during the presidency of John F Kennedy. On Monday, the official programme begins with a wreath laying ceremony at the Jose Marti (CORR) Memorial, the monument to one of the heroes of the failed Cuban revolution of the late 19th century. After that Obama will have face to face talks with President Castro, a meeting billed as \u201can opportunity to review progress made\u201d, areas of agreement and areas of disagreement \u2013 including US concerns over Cuba\u2019s human rights record. A joint press conference will follow Monday\u2019s meeting. One of the key themes of the trip will be the effort to improve standards of living for Cuban people. Obama will also attend a meeting with Cuban entrepreneurs at a session with American business leaders and Cuban-Americans who are joining the visit. On Monday night, the Obama\u2019s will be guests at a state dinner at the Revolutionary Palace. On Tuesday morning, Obama will deliver his historic speech to the Cuban people. \u201cThis speech will be a very important moment in the president\u2019s trip \u2026 an opportunity for him to describe the course that we are on, to review the complex history between our countries and the rationale behind the steps we took,\u201d Rhodes said, calling it \u201ca huge moment in the history between our countries, the first visit of a US president in nearly 90 years, certainly the first speech given by a president in Cuba in nearly 90 years\u201d. Obama also promises to meet with opposition figures as well as Cuban government officials. On Monday afternoon he will attend a baseball game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban national team. Michelle Obama will visit high school age girls in Havana and will meet with female Cuban students, some of whom have studied in the US. She will be bringing questions from US students who are interested about life in Cuba."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
