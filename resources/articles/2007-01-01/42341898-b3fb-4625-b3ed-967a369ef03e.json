I faced that scenario when reading a column in Education Guardian last week about our changes to the funding entitlement of English for speakers of other languages (Esol). One particular claim that made the All-Bran stick in the throat was that our proposals were \"the worst learning and skills decision taken since 1979\". This is choice, given that the Conservatives cut FE funding by 14% in real terms, compared with the 48% real-terms increase we've delivered since 1997. This government is fully committed to supporting the learning of English as a second language - we've increased funding threefold in the past five years. But the current position is simply unsustainable. A massive increase in demand for free Esol tuition is having an adverse impact on the overall skills budget, yet those in greatest need are the least likely to access the service. Some are angered by the fact that asylum seekers over 19 will no longer get free provision. Yet, with almost 80% of asylum claims now being settled in eight weeks, and well over half of these unsuccessful, is it really right that taxpayers' money should support the learning of English for people whom we expect to leave the country? Most reasonable people wouldn't think so. However, for those granted refugee status, legal migrant workers and British citizens whose first language is not English, mastering the language is vital for employment prospects, social inclusion and personal wellbeing. That is why I want to ensure those in the greatest need continue to get full support. The current system, even with funding having tripled, doesn't do that. Waiting lists in parts of the country are as long as two years. So we need to change. We expect the current level of funding for Esol to remain comparable next year, but we must refocus resources on those who are a priority. Among the groups of people accessing Esol, there are those from whom it is reasonable to expect a contribution to the cost of learning: either from them as individuals, because they made a choice to come to the UK to work and can afford it, or from employers who are benefiting significantly from the recruitment of labour from outside the UK. It's the same principle we are rightly applying to adult education across the board. The government is still picking up around two-thirds of the overall costs. But to manage demand more effectively, we've decided to withdraw automatic fee remission from Esol from August. Many will continue not to have to pay for Esol, and learners in priority groups - including people on benefits and many refugees who have been granted asylum or leave to remain - will remain eligible for full fee remission. We do not want to cap the Esol budget. However, we must not let Esol eat away at the resources available for other adult learning priorities. Sandy Leitch's recent report on skills needs shows how much we must do to secure our economic competitiveness. We welcome the contribution of economic migrants and appreciate that they need to learn English; but we must also address the needs of those settled in the UK who have been disadvantaged through poor skills for too long and who will remain a cost to the economy without the means to progress. Our current race equality impact assessment is critically important in informing next steps, and we are consulting on the impact of changes before they are implemented. The views of those who are feeding into the process are helping us identify where we may need to make additional help available. We will publish a report on the consultation in the coming weeks and acting on its recommendations. This is the right way to make sensible changes. \u00b7 Bill Rammell is minister for lifelong learning, further and higher education"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
