This spring, the Belong care village in Crewe organised an eight-week programme, which involved artists in residence delivering workshops for residents. The programme was part of three-year project, Where the Arts Belong, run in partnership with Liverpool\u2019s Bluecoat centre for contemporary arts and Arts Council England. It aims to assess how to effectively bring art into care environments. Belong Crewe was the first of three Belong care villages to pilot the idea of artists in residence \u2013 and the outcomes have been resoundingly positive. \u201cEverything improved, from the customers\u2019 mood to their physical health,\u201d says Natalie Ravenscroft, experience coordinator at the village. Some 55 of the village\u2019s 67 residents, many of whom have dementia, took part in the programme, including contributing to creating artworks. Most of the workshops were highly interactive and encouraged residents to form close friendships. Ravenscroft describes the bond between three residents at the village, formed in large part because of the activities. \u201cAround the time we started the project, three individuals moved in to the same house,\u201d she says. \u201cSoon, they were coming to all the sessions together, and would even ask to sit next to each other.\u201d The effects of these friendships and bonds, adds Ravenscroft, are incomparable: \u201cIt just makes them [the residents] happy. It helps them to remain healthy, both emotionally and physically.\u201d Arts in care is the theme for this year\u2019s Care Home Open Day on 28 June, and Belong Crewe and other homes across the country will invite their local communities in to celebrate creativity and showcase residents\u2019 work. Ravenscroft adds that it has been particularly touching to see residents take pride in the work they produced. \u201cIt\u2019s really lovely to watch someone be so passionate about something. For instance, we had one gentleman spend hours just finalising the detail on a clay sculpture he made,\u201d she says. Besides providing a goal and purpose, the workshops also helped residents to combat memory loss. London-based artist and filmmaker Suki Chan organised one-to-one voice recording sessions with residents, asking them about their lives and recording their responses. In the process, long-forgotten memories were revealed. In one session, a resident was able to recall her feelings on being evacuated during the war. \u201cAs the story was developing, she started adding other, smaller details, like the name of the lady that took her in,\u201d says Ravenscroft, who sat in on the interview. \u201cHer brain was building a bridge between memories and telling the story perfectly. You could 100% see that she was in that moment.\u201d Crewe stands as a prime example of the benefits that creative workshops can have in care environments. These benefits aren\u2019t limited to customers; they also extend to relatives who watch their loved ones engage with a new activity. \u201cYou get everything: smiles, amazement, tears \u2026 They\u2019re just like \u2018oh my god \u2013 look at what mum has made!\u2019\u201d says Ravenscroft. She adds that often families will join in workshops themselves. Residents communicate their excitement less explicitly, through smaller though equally significant gestures. \u201cThey\u2019ll put their hands on your face and smile, and you know that\u2019s their way of saying thank you,\u201d says Ravenscroft. For her and her colleagues, responses like that are invaluable. \u201cJust that one comment can make a difference. My job as experience coordinator involves a lot of work; it\u2019s a big role. So it\u2019s good to get encouragement.\u201d Belong\u2019s vision is that those in care must be given more skills. \u201cNormally when people go into care, they\u2019re de-skilled, everything is done for them,\u201d says Ravenscroft. \u201cBut here at Belong we want to do the opposite.There are just no boundaries on what they can do.\u201d While Ravenscroft was sad to see the spring arts programme come to an end, she is confident that the seeds have been sown at Crewe, as both staff and residents continue to develop the skills they learned. For the customers, these included sculpture, painting, photo editing and dance. For the staff, it was the variety of ways art can be used to improve residents\u2019 memories and lifestyles. \u201cThese artists have completely changed our perception of what art can be,\u201d says Ravenscroft. \u201cHopefully we can keep sustaining these skills and eventually we might have permanent artists in residence.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
