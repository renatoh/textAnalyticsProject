The new presenter of Radio 4\u2019s Today programme said her experience as a reporter on radio station LBC, when she was in her 20s, had left her with a distaste for bullying and sexual harassment in the workplace. \u201cI didn\u2019t complain,\u201d she told this week\u2019s edition of the Radio Times. \u201cIt was the world of work, the rough and tumble of the newsroom. The young women I work with at Today have zero tolerance. I hope #MeToo willI make a difference.\u201d The radio presenter said such experiences were sometimes wrongly dismissed as character-forming and she regrets not standing up to senior journalists at the time: \u201cI wish I\u2019d felt stronger, less intimidated, but in my 20s, bosses were powerful people.\u201d Kearney joined Radio 4\u2019s flagship news programme from The World at One earlier this year, as part of a job swap with former Today presenter Sarah Montague. Listening figures for the BBC programme remain high, with just over 7 million people tuning in on a weekly basis. Today\u2019s reputation for setting the agenda in the political world means it comes under substantial scrutiny - especially following the appointment of Sarah Sands, a former editor of the London Evening Standard, as the programme\u2019s boss. One of the programme\u2019s continual debates is whether to scrap the religious Thought for the Day segment, where a religious figure discusses a topical issue and how it relates to faith. Kearney, who wakes up at 3.15am so she can be in the studio from 4am onwards, said she has come to appreciate the slot. \u201cIn the past, I would have run to the radio to turn it off,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve come around to the view that a time for reflection in the morning, which is only a couple of minutes, isn\u2019t a bad thing at all.\u201d She also told the magazine that she expected longstanding co-presenter John Humphrys to continue for some time, despite constant suggestions he could be facing retirement: \u201cSitting next to him in the studio, he\u2019s crackling with energy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
