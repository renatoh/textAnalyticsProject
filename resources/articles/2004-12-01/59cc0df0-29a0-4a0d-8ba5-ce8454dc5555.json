The party was in Downing Street for the second day of talks that ministers hope could restore devolved government to Stormont. A deal could yet be brought down by disagreement on the decommissioning of IRA arms and the removal of British army watchtowers. But there is also concern that the Democratic Unionist leader, Ian Paisley, may be raising his demands in a way that will jeopardise an agreement. The veteran party boss has called for the Provisional IRA to \"wear sackcloth and ashes ... until the sackcloth and ashes wear out\" for all they did during the 30 years of the Troubles. He is also determined that IRA decommissioning should be both permanent and transparent, complete with photographic evidence that weapons stocks have finally been destroyed. Mr Adams said it was up to the Dublin and London governments to see that a power sharing deal was in line with the Good Friday agreement. \"We also look to Ian Paisley to face up to his responsibilities to join in the collective challenge of peacemaking. His failure to talk to us makes this very, very difficult and his recent remarks have compounded this difficulty. \"They also provide a rationale for his refusal to embrace the power sharing 'equality' and all-Ireland fundamentals of the Good Friday agreement. Mr Adams said Sinn F\u00e9in believed the issue of IRA arms could be dealt with \"to the satisfaction of all reasonable people\" within any agreement. Mr Adams told journalists: \"A deal is still possible, but an accommodation, a partnership of equals cannot be built through a process of humiliation. \"Our focus is on achieving that deal. It will only be possible, however, in the days ahead in the terms of the Good Friday agreement.\" It is generally assumed that Rev Paisley, aged 78 and in uncertain health, wants to be the man who clinches a workable deal, and that Sinn F\u00e9in wants one too. Above all it wants to be sure that the DUP will make power sharing work, not quickly resort to its veto. Some rank and file Provos are still angry about the previous decommissioning and opposed to any further acts, but the IRA army council and most prominent Provos are backing Sinn F\u00e9in's proposals. The Downing Street talks came as Northern Ireland's top police officer warned the IRA today he would halt a major security reduction if they went back on any pledge to go out of business. Chief Constable Hugh Orde, who yesterday held unprecedented talks with Mr Adams at Downing Street, said he would only sanction a scheme to pull down British army watchtowers and barracks once he was satisfied the Provisional's 30-year war was over for good. He told a meeting of the Northern Ireland Policing Board in Belfast today: \"Certainly there has been no declaration of normalisation. That's not within my gift, it's within the gift of political parties that need to get their act together.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
