Then Worcester Woman, the school-run mother wooed in 2001. Now meet the next election target - the Bacardi Breezer generation. They are young adults who were barely toddling when Margaret Thatcher was in her prime. Their main concerns, apart from having a good time on a Saturday night, are practical ones such as the property price boom which has left them struggling to buy a house. Aged 18-25, they have more cash than their parents did at that age, cannot remember high youth unemployment and see the row over tuition fees as irrelevant since most are not going to university anyway. Stephen Byers, the former Cabinet Minister, warns this weekend that Labour must connect with the Bacardi Breezer vote - named after their favourite alcopop - if it wants to hold on to power. 'There is a danger that we could be witnessing a whole generation being lost to our democratic political process and not seeing it as relevant to their world,' he said. They don't remember Thatcher, they weren't born when the poll tax was introduced - they are a generation for whom the political landscape is quite different. We have to find a way of addressing more directly their concerns and talking about practical things where politicians can make a difference to them.' His warning comes amid a concerted effort by senior Labour figures, alarmed by tumbling poll ratings, to 'rebrand' the Blairite project and identify the voters it needs to bring in. A shake-up of Downing Street staff - expected to see David Hill, the widely respected former party spin doctor, replacing Alastair Campbell and a refocusing of the political office - is also under way. The Prime Minister is understood to be under pressure from some Ministers to move Andrew Adonis, head of his Policy Unit, long regarded with suspicion in some quarters because of his lack of roots in the Labour Party. Adonis was highly influential on controversial issues including top-up fees. John Prescott's warning last week against a resurgence of the Tories was also calculated to rally the faithful ahead of a difficult party conference and a by-election in Brent East, and to refocus the party on a 2005-6 election. Progress on the manifesto has been slowed by the Kelly affair but ideas which could appeal to younger voters are already being discussed. One option is ensuring young people who enter full- or part-time study after sixth form are not left far worse off than those who get jobs. Senior party figures are discussing ways to extend the education maintenance allowance - a handout of \u00a330 a week which from September 2004 will be available nationally for 16- to 19-year-olds staying on in education - and bring it closer to the minimum wage for under-21s of \u00a33.60 an hour. While Labour enjoyed heavy support from young voters when in opposition, now that it has become the 'establishment', some are thought more likely to desert in favour of independent candidates or single issue parties, including the BNP. Byers said the Bacardi Breezers - raised in times of relative prosperity and inclined to spend rather than save - took high employment and low interest for granted, expecting the Government to provide more than just economic stability. While their concerns are traditional - buying a house, settling down and raising a family - their expectations, particularly of balancing home and work, differ subtly from their those of their parents. The Electoral Commission is currently spearheading a project to increase turnout among the young, including questioning whether 16-year-olds should be given the vote. But Byers said politicians would first have to develop ideas that would attract teenagers: 'The priority is to get those who already have the vote to use it.'
