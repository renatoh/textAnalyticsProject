Not a bit of it. \u201cI\u2019ve got disappointment seeping through my blood,\u201d said Derry, after Leeds came from a goal down to seal victory at the Cambs Glass Stadium. Derry\u2019s disappointment stemmed from an eight-minute second half spell in which Leeds scored two virtually identical goals, through Stuart Dallas and Alex Mowatt, when Cambridge had dominated the first half and could have added to Uche Ikpeazu\u2019s opener. \u201cYes, we can walk out with our heads held high in many respects, but I\u2019m disappointed we didn\u2019t come in 2-0 up at half-time,\u201d said Derry, a man clearly not satisfied with moral victories. Before the game the Leeds manager, Garry Monk, had promised he would \u201crespect\u201d the competition with his team selection but he made eight changes: he would protest it was not a weakened side but eyes were clearly and understandably on Friday\u2019s big game against Derby. The calculated gamble looked like it had backfired before the break, as the hosts troubled the Leeds defence with a style of play that can be filed under \u201cno frills\u201d, but without being agricultural. The vast Ikpeazu in particular seemed to disquiet the usually sturdy Pontus Jansson. The Leeds defender, who with his mohawk resembles a video game henchman, seemed to have met his match. A booking means he will miss the Derby game, while a second-half injury to Liam Cooper had Monk joking he would hunt for his boots, so light are they at the back. Cambridge\u2019s fine play was rewarded when Luke Berry, whose straggly locks gave him a look of a budget Karel Poborsky, thumped a free-kick into the wall and the ball broke loose for Ikpeazu on the right side of the area. He spun with ballerina delicacy and shot home via a flick off the near post. They pressed for another before the break, and on the balance of play they should have got one. \u201cI wanted us to take the game to the opposition,\u201d said Derry. \u201cWe got right under their skin.\u201d Everything Leeds tried seemed not to work: back passes were under hit, first touches bounced away like rubber balls off rubber walls, passes slipped through legs. Everything, that is, until the 56th minute. Mowatt, Leeds\u2019s best player on the night, clipped a cross to the back post where Dallas nodded it back into the six-yard box and into the corner. It would be a stretch to say Leeds deserved to be level but the brittleness that showed in the Cambridge defence must have encouraged Monk that a breakthrough would surely come. Eight minutes later they took the lead, and in very similar fashion. This time Jansson rose, won the header and there was Mowatt to help the ball into the net. The similarity of the two goals was the source of Derry\u2019s frustration. \u201cI\u2019m gutted at the goals we conceded tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cYou always know when you play against a higher opponent that they always have that little switch they can turn. If they drop their shoulder and ping one in from 35 yards, there\u2019s your moment of quality. But they were standard crosses into the box.\u201d For Leeds, it was a job done, and perhaps a glimpse of what Mowatt, a player whose career has drifted a little, is capable of. The midfielder looked a star in the making when he broke into the first team a few years ago but has started only four league games this season. Yet while this was \u201conly\u201d a League Two side, his performance suggests he could feature more as the season goes on. \u201cIt\u2019s never easy when you haven\u2019t had many minutes, but he epitomised everything good we did tonight,\u201d said Monk afterwards Cambridge came back in the latter stages, Ikpeazu creating more problems, but a late goalmouth scramble, surely the most fitting way to finish an FA Cup tie such as this, resulted in nothing, and Leeds held on. They now face another trip to rustic surroundings in the fourth round, where they will play either AFC Wimbledon or Sutton United. \u201cThat\u2019s the FA Cup,\u201d said Monk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
