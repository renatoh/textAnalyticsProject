He had been recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Bushwick Bill was born Richard Shaw in Jamaica, moving first to New York before settling in Houston. His Geto Boys career started first as a dancer, calling himself Little Billy \u2013 a play on his dwarfism \u2013 later becoming a rapper and forming the classic lineup of the group alongside rappers Scarface and Willie D. The group became notorious for their occasionally ultra-violent \u201chorrorcore\u201d lyrics, though they also frequently wrote about social issues, from opposing the first Gulf war to deprivation and police brutality. They broke into the US mainstream in 1991 with their track Mind Playing Tricks on Me, and became hugely influential for creating a southern US flavour to gangsta rap. Geto Boys had their biggest chart success in 1996 with the album The Resurrection, which reached No 6 in the US charts, while in 1999, they earned a new audience through prominent use of their songs in the cult film comedy Office Space. In 1991, Bill lost an eye after accidentally shooting himself in an argument with his girlfriend. He was pronounced dead, but later regained consciousness while in the hospital morgue. \u201cMy toe was tagged and they were pushing me in the drawer,\u201d he recalled in a 2014 interview. \u201cI looked both ways and I saw frozen people to the left and frozen people to the right. I thought I was dreaming, then I saw people in front of me pushing the door closed and I was like, \u2018Yo!\u2019\u201d Following his cancer diagnosis this year, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m afraid of dying, because \u2026 I died and came back already, in June 1991. I know what it\u2019s like on the other side.\u201d A Geto Boys reunion tour had been announced earlier this year, but was cancelled in late May. Bill\u2019s death was reported prematurely, with his son writing on Instagram on Sunday: \u201cMy dad IS NOT dead, he\u2019s still alive and fighting for his life. He needs your continued prayers and support. Certain people have been so quick to write him off as dead so they can capitalize off it.\u201d His publicist has confirmed he died later that evening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
