Japan became the first team in World Cup history to win three group matches and not reach the quarter-finals. Their failure to secure any bonus points cost them but they were more than a bonus to a game which at the highest level has become all too often a battle of big bodies and dull wits. Japan showed there is still room for skill and, while they were not at their best here, they showed that if in the next four years the work of Eddie Jones, who came so close to securing a quarter-final against the country he took to the 2003 World Cup final, Australia, are built on, they will be a force in the 2019 tournament which they are hosting. There was a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for Japan with the USA as physically imposing as South Africa, some big units in their pack complemented by the aptly named Thretton Palamo in the midfield. Not for the first time in this tournament size barely mattered against opponents whose verve and skill will be one of the most lasting legacies on this year\u2019s tournament. Their early departure is the World Cup\u2019s loss, no more Fumiaki Tanaka scheming around the fringe of rucks, no more Craig Wing haunting defences with his ability to spring into contact and out again and no more Michael Leitch, the captain, hoovering up the mess left by exuberance. The USA had a healthy share of possession and territory but were slower in thought and deed. They regained the lead after 24 minutes when Chris Wyles\u2019 long pass gave Takudzwa Ngwenya the room to score in the right-hand corner having scored the first points of the game through an Alan MacGinty penalty. Japan\u2019s first try was slick, Wing weaving into space for Yoshikazu Fujita to kick into the USA 22. Ryu Koliniasi picked up and, when the attack was moved to the left, Leitch drew the defence for Harumichi Tatekawa to give Kotaro Matsushima a clear run to the line. Their second try was not such a work of art. The second-row Luke Thompson was surprised to receive a pass as he stood stationary with his back to the USA line but somehow Japan managed to roll a maul over the line for the wing Fujita to put them ahead for the second time. When Ayumu Goromaru kicked a penalty either side of the interval, becoming the first player from a tier-two nation to pass 700 points in Test rugby, victory looked secure for Japan before the USA muscled their way back into the game. But their only reward for pressure was a second MacGinty penalty. Ngwenya thought he was away for a second try only to be caught by the replacement No8, Amanaki Mafi. He came on at half-time and scored Japan\u2019s third try from an attacking line-out, claiming the ball as the USA prepared to defend a rolling maul. The USA had the final word with Wyles finishing off a forceful attack, but it was Japan who made the statement.
