Of the chance to join the north London clubs, the former France captain said: \"I decided against it because you play too many games in England, and I went to Italy.\" The continuing congested fixture schedule in English football was also the reason, he said, why Premiership clubs often struggled in European competition. \"When you don't have a winter break you can't be at your highest level when the spring comes,\" he added. \"Actually, you are injury-prone and the team cannot be at its best. \"You don't have such a heavy schedule in Italy. In five years in Serie A I was never injured.\" Platini, currently a member of Uefa's executive commitee, will run for the top office in European football when the governing body elects a successor to Sweden's Lennart Johansson. \"My values are passion and the love of the game,\" the 49-year-old said. \"Today, football is going through some turbulent times. I want to invest myself to stop them.\" Johansson's successor could be elected in April 2006, or the election could be pushed back to 2007 for statutory reasons. Platini was France's coach at Euro 92 in Sweden and joint head of the organising committee for the 1998 World Cup in his own country. He is currently an adviser to Fifa's president Sepp Blatter and a vice-president of the French football federation. As a player, the midfielder led the French to their 1984 European Championship triumph, scoring nine goals - including two hat-tricks. Two years later, France reached the World Cup semi-finals in Mexico with Platini again captaining the side. With Juventus, he was named European player of the year three successive times from 1983-1985, in the last year also winning the world individual crown as his Italian club won the European Cup. On a current burning issue, Platini urged the referee Anders Frisk to reconsider his decision to retire. \"I am in favour of Mr Frisk returning to his position. It would be good for football,\" he said. \"What happened with Mr Frisk is not good.\" The Swedish referee said last week that he would retire because he had received death threats from Chelsea fans after their Champions League defeat at Camp Nou in the first leg of their tie with Barcelona. Platini also said the current set-up of one referee and two linesmen did not offer enough protection against contro versial decisions. But he ruled out video replays. \"I am totally against the introduction of technology, but I am in favour of a fourth referee behind the goal,\" he said. The fourth offical would be used \"to judge whether or not there is a penalty, and whether or not the ball has crossed the line\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
