There\u2019s always a grand entry to these climate summits \u2013 or conferences of the parties (COP) to the UN climate convention \u2013 as if to remind the thousands of delegates traipsing in each day that they are entering Planet COP. After 21 years the annual summits have a familiar structure even though each takes place in a difference country. There\u2019s a similar lay-out \u2013 huge halls with little prefabricated offices for each national delegation or international organisation. Some are fancier than others. The UN usually has a relaxation lounge. Some have gimmicks. This year China has a talking robot that tells you the greenhouse emissions you have created travelling to Paris and how you might offset them. There\u2019s a pavilion where all manner of climate-related organisations set up stalls and a media room as big as a barn and some gimmicks to provide photographic backdrops \u2013 in Paris, somewhat unoriginally \u2013 a mini Eiffel tower. And everything is climate-themed \u2013 from the water bottle in each participants\u2019 welcome pack (Did you know that most of us use around 650 plastic cups each year? For France alone that\u2019s 25 Eiffel towers of waste\u201d) to the chocolate bars handed out on the way in (containing letters from the world\u2019s children as a \u201csweet reminder\u201d of the requests from young \u201cclimate justice ambassadors\u201d.) Stretching the friendship But while Planet COP is obsessively, earnestly devoted to a global agreement on climate change \u2013 it sometimes seems less weird than Planet Oz. Malcolm Turnbull joined 150 world leaders on Monday urging a Paris deal that locks in current national greenhouse gas-reducing commitments and then rachets them up every five years. But at home he was being warned \u2013 in anonymous quotes to the Daily Telegraph \u2013 that there would be \u201chell to pay\u201d if he even considered increasing Australia\u2019s commitment because Tony Abbott had already \u201cstretched the friendship\u201d with the current 26-28% target by 2030. Apparently Australia\u2019s fair share of avoiding catastrophic warming is to be determined by unspecified \u201cfriendships\u201d within the Coalition. And the same mindset inside his own conservative parties meant that \u2013 even as he pledged to increase spending on clean energy research and development, Turnbull could not say he had abandoned Tony Abbott\u2019s plan to abolish the agencies that commercialise and fund that same technology \u2013 the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Planet COP is a strange microcosm, but Planet Oz can sometimes seem stranger. And the gap between them looks even bigger than the gap between dangerous global warming and the world\u2019s promised reductions in emissions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
