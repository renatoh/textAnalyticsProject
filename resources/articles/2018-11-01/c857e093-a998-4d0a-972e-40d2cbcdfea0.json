This is a player who had grown used to lugging the weight of expectation during an England career that will extend to a 120th cap on Thursday night. Yet the late cameo the DC United striker enjoys against the United States on his first appearance for the national team in 734 days will be different. For Rooney, this may be a throwback. A chance for the world to recall the tearaway who ripped into Turkey at the Stadium of Light on a first competitive start, or rampaged through all-comers so startlingly en route to the quarter-finals at Euro 2004 in Portugal. At 33, the body will inevitably lack the energy of youth. Time may have dulled some of the zest but the mind will be free. Liberated. It may be the perfect way to go out because, as he readily conceded, there were times when things were far from enjoyable. \u201cThere were maybe times when I didn\u2019t enjoy it as much as I should,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was down to the pressure I put on myself which, obviously when you\u2019re in that mode, you don\u2019t want to admit is there. I\u2019ve stepped back from that now and can analyse it, and see it was there. It makes you try too hard, makes you anxious, so you don\u2019t enjoy it as much as you should. It affects your performance, because you play your best football and put in your best performances when you\u2019re enjoying playing. And I\u2019m going to enjoy Thursday.\u201d Rooney returned from the US to discover some observers, including plenty of former internationals from Peter Shilton to Stuart Pearce, questioning why a preparatory friendly three days before a Nations League match against Croatia is to be transformed into the Wayne Rooney Foundation International. The recall has devalued the occasion they said, for all that the charitable collections outside the stadium are to be welcomed. The former captain, fresh from two training sessions with a vibrant young squad, was diplomatic when contemplating an occasion 12 months in the making. Everyone, he said, is entitled to their opinion. \u201cBut whether people agree with it or not, it\u2019s something that\u2019s happening,\u201d he added. \u201cA lot of the older players, players who won the World Cup, weren\u2019t treated as well as they should have been. As a country, we haven\u2019t done anything like this before. It\u2019s the first time. I hope, in 10 or 15 years\u2019 time, we\u2019re sat here for someone like Harry Kane, who could possibly go on and get the goalscoring record, and it will be something that happens again. The FA are trying to move in a different direction and celebrate the players who have made an impact for their country.\u201d There was a passing denial he had gatecrashed that wedding at the team hotel in November 2016, the day after he had won his 119th cap in a victory over Scotland, and a reminder that Gareth Southgate \u201cdid pick me again, actually\u201d after the incident. \u201cAlso, if I was in a position where this game was going to take the [125-cap] record off Peter Shilton, I would never have played in the game. I would never have done that. But the game isn\u2019t going to affect an outfield player record or Peter Shilton\u2019s in that aspect, so we felt it was a good opportunity to say a thank you to the fans, but also to raise money for underprivileged children who need it desperately. It was the right decision to make.\u201d This will be it as far as his career on English soil is concerned, whether the country\u2019s leading scorer comes on and scores a 10-minute hat-trick or barely touches the ball. There will be no loan moves from DC United, to whom he is contracted for a further three years, back to the Premier League and no late case staked to be retained for Sunday\u2019s game against Croatia. Southgate will take the chance to tap into Rooney\u2019s knowledge around the farewell. At some stage before the USA match Rooney will speak to the squad, or at least their younger contingent. He stands by his decision to retire internationally 15 months ago but has been welcomed back into the fold with open arms, even by the manager whose desire to turn to youth effectively curtailed his career. The former Manchester United and Everton striker said Southgate is \u201cfearless\u201d. \u201cA lot of the other managers didn\u2019t really give youth the opportunity to express themselves and come into the team and have an impact, but Gareth has done that, giving them experience but also belief they can perform well and be successful for their country. \u201cI thought they would be good enough to have a go at a World Cup, but maybe the next one (2022) rather than in Russia. They proved me wrong on that. These players seem comfortable in each other\u2019s company. Of the six managers I played for, while there were a few who brought in individual young players, to bring so many through as a group and have that trust in them \u2026 he deserves a lot of credit. \u201cBut my time has been and gone. Some good games, some bad games. That\u2019s the story of my England career. I\u2019ll take away being the record goalscorer and representing my country 119 times and feeling immense pride at having done that.\u201d That tally will be swollen by one, with the youngest of his four boys, Cass, watching his father in an England shirt for the first time. No pressure indeed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
