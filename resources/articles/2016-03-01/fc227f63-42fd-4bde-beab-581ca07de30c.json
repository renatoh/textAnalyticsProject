Trevor Nunn staged it as a live-action drama and Ireland\u2019s Pan Pan Theatre sat us in semi-darkness listening to prerecorded voices. Max Stafford-Clark, in an Out of Joint production first seen at the Enniskillen festival, finds a third way here, by having a blindfolded audience listen to the story of Maddy Rooney trudging to a rural railway station to meet her blind husband off a train. It works brilliantly. What hits you, especially in the first half, is Beckett\u2019s graveyard wit which has the audience constantly chuckling. When a racecourse clerk offers Br\u00edd Brennan\u2019s caustic, needy Mrs Rooney a lift, he asks if she is going in his direction. \u201cI am, Mr Slocum. We all are,\u201d she replies with a hint of mortality. Yet seconds later we are into the realm of low comedy as we picture Mr Slocum shunting his overweight passenger into his car and announcing: \u201cI\u2019m as stiff as yourself.\u201d Until the arrival of the train, the play offers a riotous re-creation of Beckett\u2019s memories of his native village of Foxrock. Wearing blindfolds forces us to listen more intently. I was especially struck not just by the tenacity of Beckett\u2019s Protestantism but by his evocation of a past where the rural poor were steeped in books: the Rooneys dwell on Theodor Fontane\u2019s Effi Briest and Mr Rooney compares the two of them to \u201cDante\u2019s damned, with their faces arsy-versy\u201d. This long-ignored piece strikes me as Beckett\u2019s best play and in Stafford-Clark\u2019s production, with its diverse aural decor and voices looming at us out of the dark, it comes to vivid life. At Wilton\u2019s Music Hall, London, until 9 April. Buy tickets at the Guardian box office or call 0330-333 6906."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
