She didn't want to dress up as a pirate for a party; she wanted to wear a pink dress and a tiara. \"The problem isn't between my legs,\" Vanessa tells her mother, in this moving monologue, \"it's between my ears.\" As she grew older, she saw her penis as an asylum seeker: \"Present but not welcome.\" When she grew breasts, her dad demanded to know what they were going to tell everyone. Vanessa was Belgium's first transsexual. Although it is better understood now, when Vanessa was growing up in the postwar period, people thought transsexuality had something to do with sex. The unavailability of gender-reassignment surgery in Europe meant Vanessa headed to Morocco in the mid-1970s. In Belgium, apparently, being transgendered could \"get you stoned\"; in Morocco, women were shrouded in veils but the climate was more accepting. Look Mummy, I'm Dancing is a very personal story. She never quite makes all the material come alive in performance, but Vanessa's account of her relationship with her parents - particularly her mother - is touching. Family are often the unsung heroes of transgender stories, and Vanessa plays due tribute. But the evening is rather shapeless: stories begin but aren't finished; other episodes, such as her marriage to a man in a Spanish jail, skirted over. There is an ambiguity in her attitudes towards women and their relationships with men that is tinged with sadness. Vanessa has a story worth hearing, but she hasn't yet found the best way to tell it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
