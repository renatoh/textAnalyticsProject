In hindsight, he was almost definitely thinking of recently departed X Factor contestant Wagner Fiuza-Carrilho when he wrote those words. For the last few weeks, Wagner had been burning with the kind of coruscating intensity that only a boggle-eyed fluorescent orange former PE teacher who appeared to cite Hulk Hogan and Dog The Bounty Hunter as style icons could summon. But now he is no more. Wagner has been eliminated from X Factor forever. Those who allowed themselves to be penetrated by his magnificence will understand why this is such an unbearable moment. Wagner was unlike any contestant that X Factor had ever seen. He may not have been the sort of pitch-perfect moppet the show prides itself on churning out, but he was undeniably his own man. Wagner had seen life. He knew women. He used to put on skimpy pants and hold lions by their tails. Age may have dimmed his good looks and made him forget what constitutes a decent haircut, but the fire was still burning strongly in him nonetheless. That was never more evident than in his bongo solo during his performance of Love Shack. Wagner pounded those skins like a dervish, like a wild-eyed preacher trying to beat the evil out of them. He hammered those bongos so hard that, yes, he may have gone wildly out of tune in the process, but it hardly mattered. We were hooked. And throughout the weeks - through Bat Out Of Hell, through She Bangs, through Hey Jude, through last night's unusually restrained rendition of Creep - we remained hooked. And, try as various shadowy forces might, he couldn't be killed. It didn't matter what tactics were used against him - reports that he was antisocial, reports that he hated X Factor, reports that he was a drug-smoking benefit cheat sex pest - Wagner's believers kept him in. Not even Simon Cowell's classic move of pretending to like Wagner in the vain hope that people would lose interest once he had the blessing of The Man, could shift him. For two months, Wagner clung on like a barnacle. Nothing could remove Wagner from his destiny. In many ways, he was the people's Rasputin. But now he is no more. In truth, Wagner was never going to win X Factor, and his obituaries had started to be written as soon as this week's double elimination was announced. The moment that he discovered that his opponent in the sing-off would be enthusiastic supermarket belter Mary Byrne, he knew it was over too. It may come to pass that Mary received fewer public votes than Wagner, but the judges were always going to favour her bellowed Shirley Basseyisms over him. That's probably why his final performance of Unforgettable seemed so perfectly elegiac. Much has been written in the press about why Wagner managed to survive for so long. Most of the articles seemed to mark him down as the default protest vote, the contestant who'd do most damage to X Factor by winning. I honestly hope that wasn't the case. Surely if anybody wanted to cause damage to X Factor then they wouldn't even watch it, let alone waste their money on a vote. Personally, I love X Factor. And yet Wagner was my favourite contestant by a clear margin. Rather than bleating on about exhaustion or song choices or the pressures of fame, he looked like he was having an absolute ball every second he was up there. He might not have hit many of the notes he was supposed to, and he barely even remembered the words to any of his songs, but this made him seem more winningly human to me. He was the beating heart of X Factor and, without him, the last two weeks are going to bore my pants off. Wagner, you were the greatest. That said, I withhold the right to take all of this back 20 seconds into the first episode of your inevitable ITV2 reality series. Even I have limits."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
