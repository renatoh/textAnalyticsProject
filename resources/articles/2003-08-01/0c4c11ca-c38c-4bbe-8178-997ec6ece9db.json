Drummond and Asafa Powell of Jamaica had been disqualified from the second of the four races under the IAAF's controversial new false-start rule, by which the first man to jump the gun is given a warning and anyone who transgresses thereafter is summarily ejected from the race. Most athletes see the rule, which was introduced in an attempt to please television producers by reducing delays, as essentially unfair. Drummond, Powell and seemingly all the spectators inside the Stade de France needed no convincing. After Jamaican Dwight Thomas had been cautioned for an initial and quite obvious false start, the runners were called back from a second start and red cards were placed in the lanes of Drummond and Powell. Both appeared stunned, the more so when the big screen replay convinced the crowd that an injustice had been committed. \"I didn't move,\" Drummond shouted at the judges. Aged 33, a notable extrovert and a singer in gospel-music groups, he has been a member of the US team for a decade and is vastly experienced in international competition. He was unimpressed when the judges produced a computer print-out that showed that his reaction time had been below the permitted minimum of 0.1sec. Then he began his protest, lying down first in front of his blocks and then 30 yards down the track, while an official stood over him holding a red card. \"I'm not moving,\" he declared. The crowd's reaction did nothing to discourage him, while the organisers were clearly in a state of disarray. No announcements were made to explain the position, leaving the white-shirted officials to take the brunt of the public's displeasure. After 15 minutes of stalemate, both disqualified runners appeared to take the decision to leave the track. Powell went quietly by the back door, but the American followed the example set by Linford Christie in similar circumstances at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, pulling down the top of his skinsuit and stalking along the length of the straight, making his displeasure even plainer. Halfway down the track, however, and directly under the eyes of Juan Antonio Samaranch and Jacques Rogge, the past and present presidents of the International Olympic Committee, he was approached by an official. That seemed to change his mind. He pulled his top back up, turned on his heel and marched back to the blocks, indicating that he expected to be included in the re-start. Once again the organisers were nonplussed and, 25 minutes after the race had been due to take place, all eight runners were herded from the track and the competitors in the third quarter-final were ushered on. While essentially of the IAAF's making, the brouhaha could be seen by unfriendly eyes as the first small dent in Paris's campaign to host the 2012 Olympics. After both remaining quarter-finals had been completed, the runners for the second race returned. Booing erupted when it became obvious that there were two empty lanes, increasing in intensity whenever the competitors tried to make a start and whenever the crowd looked at the big screen and saw pictures of Drummond outside on the warm-up track, in tears on the shoulder of his coach, John Smith. He had been persuaded to accept his disqualification after discussions with officials of the US team, who later announced they would be lodging an appeal on his behalf. Pleas from Ato Boldon, the Trinidadian sprinter and Drummond's training partner, and from Eunice Barber, the French hepathlete who was waiting to compete in the final round of her event, eventually persuaded the crowd to keep quiet while the race took place. Their ill-humour turned to cheers when a French runner, Ronald Pognon, claimed fourth place, qualifying for today's semi-finals. Britain's trio of Dwain Chambers, Mark Lewis-Francis and Darren Campbell all made it through, with Chambers the third fastest in 10.03 seconds. The unexpected fastest man of the round was Darrel Brown, an 18-year-old from Trinidad and Tobago who recorded 10.01. Kim Collins of St Kitts and Nevis, the Commonwealth Games champion, split Brown and Chambers with a time of 10.02. They will be joined by Maurice Greene, who is going for a fourth consecutive world title, and Tim Montgomery, the world record holder. But the only real talking point last night was Drummond's protest, and the impact it may have on the false-start rule, which came into use this year and has now claimed its first high-profile victim. Drummond may face further punishment, but the IAAF and the championships organisers need to examine their own inadequate reaction. \"We told the IAAF that it was a bad rule,\" Boldon said. \"We said this rule will never work. Nobody wants it. The machines are not perfect. There were 50,000 pairs of eyes out there who could see that this was a bad call.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
