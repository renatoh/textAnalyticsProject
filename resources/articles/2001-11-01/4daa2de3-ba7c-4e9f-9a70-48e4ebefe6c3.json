A Fifa source, however, said that England had \"no chance\" of being nominated among the top eight seeds, which means they will be placed in the second tier, along with the Republic of Ireland. In that case, they would be drawn in a four-team group which will also contain one of the six strongest nations or one of the two host countries, Japan and South Korea. The likely seeds are Japan, South Korea, the 1998 champions France, Argentina, Brazil, Italy and Germany. Spain will probably complete the eight top-seeded teams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
