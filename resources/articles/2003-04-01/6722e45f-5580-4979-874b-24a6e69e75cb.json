As the US vice-president, Dick Cheney, declared that President Saddam's regime was over, jubilant Iraqis gathered in one of the capital's main squares to watch as US troops toppled a giant statue of the Iraqi president. Iraqis had earlier attacked the base of the 20ft (six metre) statue's plinth with a sledgehammer. However, fierce fighting continued throughout eastern and north-eastern parts of the city, with marines coming under heavy machine-gun fire only blocks away from the squares where crowds were gathering to celebrate the dictator's fall. US central command in Qatar warned that central Baghdad \"remains dangerous\", and predicted that days of stiff fighting in northern Iraq and President Saddam's hometown of Tikrit lie ahead. \"We are seeing the collapse of the central regime authority,\" said Mr Cheney. He warned, however, that \"we still have a lot to do\", and said that he could not predict when the war would end. Earlier today, Brigadier General Vincent Brooks said that Iraqis had reached the \"tipping point\". \"There is a broad recognition that this regime is coming to an end and will not return in the way it has been in the past,\" he told reporters, according to Reuters news agency. However, he warned that the regime still posed a threat, including the possible use of chemical or biological weapons. Looting broke out unhindered in much of Baghdad as US troops advanced through the capital. Guardian reporter James Meek, who was with US marines in Baghdad, said that resistance to the US troops had \"all but collapsed\". Downing Street said command and control in Baghdad \"appeared to have disintegrated\". TV pictures showed Iraqis welcoming US forces, and chaotic scenes of government buildings being looted without any sign of Iraqi police or troops keeping order. There were also reports of Iraqis celebrating in Kurdish areas of northern Iraq. These included the city of Irbil, 220 miles north of Baghdad, and the Guardian's Luke Harding, in Sulaimaniya, also witnessed scenes of jubilation. \"Everybody has poured out onto the street and there are scenes of total chaos and sheer, sheer delight,\" he said. \"Thousands of people are in the streets celebrating. They believe Iraq is liberated. They believe that Saddam Hussein is finished and it's all over. There's an absolute damburst of joy here.\" In Baghdad, the UN headquarters and shops near the Olympic Committee's building were ransacked, as were military installations, the secret police headquarters, government buildings and research institutions. Computers, furniture and even military jeeps were taken from sites around the city. There were also signs that Iraq's efforts to sustain its public relations campaign were collapsing after government-employed journalists' minders failed to turn up for their work. Uncensored reports by foreign reporters began to come from the capital, and Iraqi state television was off the air. The action followed one of quietest nights in Baghdad since the conflict began. US troops advanced on central Baghdad from the south-west of the city. Other units steadily expanded their reach, opening a new northern corridor in the city. They secured a military airport and a prison, and set fire to a Republican Guard barracks. From the south-east, marines secured routes inside the city and pursued small, roving bands of Iraqis armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons. In one neighbourhood, numerous civilians flashed thumbs-up signals to the US troops. Jubilation as Saddam loses grip on capital Tikrit targeted amid claims Saddam has fled to hometown US and UK forces were today focusing on another target: President Saddam's hometown, Tikrit, which is still a stronghold of his loyalist troops. The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, one of two main Iraqi Kurdish groups opposing Saddam, claimed that he was hiding in Tikrit. US officers said special forces and air strikes were \"actively engaging\" Iraqi forces in Tikrit. Brig Gen Brooks said that US forces have tried to block the roads from Baghdad to Tikrit to stop the regime's leaders from fleeing north. The Kurdish claim follows speculation about whether Saddam survived Monday's \"decapitation\" strike, in which four 2,000lb US bombs destroyed a Baghdad restaurant where the Iraqi president and his sons were believed to have been meeting. Saddam's fate remained unknown, but his loyalists retained control of the Baghdad area targeted in the US strike intended to kill him. The British foreign intelligence agency, MI6, reportedly told the CIA that it believed Saddam and his two sons had left the restaurant moments before it was turned into a 60ft crater. The prime minister, Tony Blair, today stressed that it was difficult to know what was left of the Iraqi regime, and precisely who would have the authority to surrender to coalition forces. \"This conflict is not over yet,\" Mr Blair told the Commons. \"There are still some very difficult things to do. As we speak, there is still intense resistance ... amongst those parts of Saddam's regime that want to cling on to power.\" The chancellor, Gordon Brown, promised \u00a3240m for humanitarian aid to Iraq in his Budget address to MPs. In Moscow, the Russian foreign ministry dismissed rumours that President Saddam had taken refuge in the Russian embassy in Baghdad. Saddam survived attack on building, say British intelligence sources Red Cross suspends Baghdad operations The international Red Cross said today that it had temporarily suspended operations in Baghdad after one of its staff members went missing. The ICRC said that Vatche Arslanian, 48, a Canadian, was likely to have been seriously injured after the vehicle he was travelling in was hit by gunfire. He has not been seen since Tuesday afternoon, the agency said. The EU today agreed to spend 9.5m (\u00a36.5m) euros on urgent humanitarian aid to Iraq. EU spokesman Michael Curtis said that the money would be used to rush clean water, medical supplies and foodstuffs including rice, salt and sugar, to mainly both Baghdad and southern Iraq. The money is the latest slice of a 21m euro emergency aid package for Iraq being prepared by the EU head office. A further 79m euros is expected to be cleared soon by EU officials. The cash injection from the EU comes as the World Health Organisation warned that the capital's hospitals were running out of supplies to treat burns, shrapnel wounds and spinal injuries caused by the fighting. Baghdad hospitals pushed to the limit Sheikh to help restore order in Basra British forces in southern Iraq were today working to restore order in the heavily-looted streets of Basra, as desperate citizens swarmed water tanker trucks one day after UK soldiers claimed Iraq's second city. British forces also began establishing the country's first post-war administration yesterday, granting a local sheikh the power to set up an administrative committee representing the groups in the region. The US military said looting was already dying down in Basra and would soon do so in Baghdad. Tribal leader to help curb looting In other developments today: \u00b7 John R.
