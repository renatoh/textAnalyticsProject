The Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) said that the short-term political cycle and spending decisions were leaving necessary work undone and delaying big projects. ICE said urgent, immediate action was needed to invest in roads to tackle a maintenance backlog including millions of potholes, with guaranteed funding for five years for the Highways Agency. The engineering body also said that the government should now choose to either expand Heathrow or build a new hub airport in the south-east. Steven Hayter, the chair of the ICE's transport panel, said: \"In the last five years many of the most important issues \u2013 from aviation capacity through to severe pothole damage \u2013 are still unresolved. \"The need for a coherent, long-term transport strategy, particularly for England, is becoming urgent.\" The ICE proposed an independent infrastructure commission to develop transport strategy beyond electoral cycles, although Hayter said he believed the current Airports Commission was delaying decisions to suit \"parliamentarians but not the public\". Transport minister Stephen Hammond said that \"big projects will never happen without consensus\" and political mileage. He said: \"We need to build a consensus: that's the job of the commission. I don't believe it's kicking it into the long grass.\" Hammond said he agreed that \"roads have suffered from a lack of investment in recent decades,\" and said the government was committed to spending billions on major road schemes. A green paper outlining reform to road ownership and funding is expected soon. The ICE said other areas for urgent attention included making buses outside London an attractive alternative for travel and unlocking the potential of cycling. A separate RAC Foundation report found there had been a \"significant shift\" in road policy, with 32 of 96 unfunded schemes from 2011 now being given the go-ahead. RAC director Stephen Glaister said: \"It's a very welcome development that the government has been delivering on projects to enhance strategic and local road networks.\" Photograph : Foster and partners/PA"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
