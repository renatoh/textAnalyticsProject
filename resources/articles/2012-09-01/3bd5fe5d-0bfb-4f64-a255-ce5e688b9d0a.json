A more adventurous beast than last year's Pressure and Time, the Californians' third album is a riotous carnival of Zep-saluting riffs, sunkissed psychedelia and irresistible hooks, with the band's soul, funk and blues influences thrust joyously to the fore. Vocalist Jay Buchanan is a revelation: cocksure and sassy on the anthemic opener Keep on Swinging and the lascivious clatter of You Want To and achingly vulnerable on the languorous Jordan, he is a mesmerising presence throughout. The perfect soundtrack for the summer we never had, everything from loose-limbed rumblers such as All the Way and the Monkees-plus-peyote stomp of Wild Animal through to the sublime two-part fever dream of Manifest Destiny throbs with analogue warmth and a near-chewable sense of celebration. If you thrilled to the Black Keys' El Camino, it's time to meet your new favourite band."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
