Barred by encroaching fame from his preferred hunting grounds of the nocturnal pursuits of the urban, lower middle-class youth, Skinner opted instead to delve into the grab bag of rock'n'roll clich\u00e9 and emerged with what sounded precariously like an article of bad faith. It was also, finally, the album he had to make \u2013 too smart not to grasp the potential alienating effect of forcing yet another record about celebrity ennui down the public's throat, yet too avowedly autobiographical to shrink from uncomfortable home truths, the result was a morally ambivalent spread at several removes from the self-effacing humanity of his 2002 debut, Original Pirate Material. If The Hardest Way \u2026 played out as a knowing re-run of every celebrity car-crash story, Everything is Borrowed twists free of the wreckage for a suitably zen riposte which, perhaps unsurprisingly, winds up more platitudinous than profound: 'All these walls were never really there / Nor the ceiling or the chair/ Life lies in the blink of an eye / The old die for reasons, new tides for seasons' ('The Escapist'). Still, there's pleasure to be had in hearing Skinner fighting fit once again. The opening title track sounds every bit the breath of fresh air it was no doubt intended as, sweeping away the debris of lives past with its sweetly affecting declaration: 'I came to this world with nothing / And I leave with nothing but love / Everything else is just borrowed.' 'On the Flip of a Coin' makes a game stab at allegorical narrative over an easy-rolling R&amp;B strut, while 'The Sherry End''s sharp-suited funk bumps up against a fizzing lyric celebrating the private lingo that exists between friends. But elsewhere things take a turn for the ruminative and Skinner's delivery slackens off to a flat pop drawl, straining under the weight of his would-be poetic imagery (the album has been deliberately shorn of the usual Rizla-toting, modern-day references). 'Alleged Legends'' secular musings ('When you're bad you will feel sad / That's the religion I live by') are flatly embarrassing, while the record's liveliest vocal turn, on 'The Dodo', is wasted on an ill-judged, state-of-the-planet address. Musically, the record takes its cues from The Hardest Way \u2026 in its expansion of the Streets' template into a more rock-based territory, where slick basslines permeate and even the odd guitar solo manages to sneak in under the radar. As such, it's a more varied listen but also markedly lesser in impact. Perhaps Skinner needs to reconnect with his club roots; it was possible to discern a similar downturn in the quality of the Prodigy's output circa Keith Flint's hair losing the plot, and it's hard not to think of the shift towards a rock band set-up here as a conservative one. On his MySpace blog Skinner has already declared the next Streets album will be his last, abandoning samples altogether in favour of a completely live set-up. With his sharp eye for the minutiae of modern life almost masochistically reined in on Everything is Borrowed, let's just hope he doesn't go mugging himself.
