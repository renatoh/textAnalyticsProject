Referee Pierluigi Collina (Italy) 1 Real Madrid get things underway. 2 Lively start for Barcelona as Javier Saviola charges off down the right and makes his way into the area - and a mini wall of Madrid defenders. 5 Five minutes in and Madrid manage to push up into Barcelona's half... 6 ... Madrid play it from right to left across the Barca penalty area via Zinedine Zidane and Guti but they can't make it work. 8 Luis Figo, Guti, Raul and Zidane all invloved on the edge of the Barca area but can do no more than pass among themselves. 10 Former Madrid player Luis Enrique does well to win a free-kick 30 yards out on the right; Xavi takes and Luis Enrique manages to guide the ball goalwards with Philip Cocu in hot pursuit; keeper Cesar always going to be first there. Madrid a bit shabby defending that free-kick. 12 Barca win a corner, Makalele heads clear. 15 Fabio Rochemback with a great throughball from the right to find Luis Enrique in space, but he can't control and is tackled. 16 Roberto Carlos close to unlocking Barca's back door when his arching cross falls too long for Raul in acres of space 25 yards out. 18 A bit of afters when Makalele shows his studs to Luyis Enrique for a Barca free-kick 28 yards out; Frank de Boer takes, a deflection carries the ball just wide with keeper Cesar stranded. 26 Madrid corner, Roberto Carlos takes but nothing doing. 27 Barca counter but before they know it, Zidane has picked up possession in midfield and proceeds to waltz his way to the edge of the area as space opens up in front of him. Barca get it together belatedly and lock him out. 30 Repeated sloppy feet from Barca lets Raul do a waltz through midfield and play in Guti for a shot from the right corner of the area; Roberto Bonano saves for a corner. Figo takes but Barca clear. Barca living a little dangerously. 32 Luis Enrique with a deflected shot from just inside the Madrid area; two corners in a row result, but no joy for Barca. 38 Rochemback comes close when his shot from full-on 25 yards comes off Cesar's right-hand post, with the kepper himself stranded again. Cesar injured when Patrick Kluivert slides in for the rebound. Resulting corner comes to nothing. 42 GOAL: Real Madrid 1 - 0 Barcelona Raul the meister here, with a belting left-foot shot from 20 yards that left Bonano with no chance at all. All over for Barca surely. 45 Roberto Carlos with a free-kick 40-plus yards out, but he scuffs it slightly and sends it wide. Half-time. Poor old Barca. Had a good half, plenty of possession and now they're stuffed. 46 Substitution Marc Overmars on for Francesco Coco. 47 Disastrous slip by Abelardo allows Guti to belt away into space, but he fluffs his shot from 20 yards. 48 GOAL: Real Madrid 1 - 1 Barcelona Saviola the man to put Barca back in with a shout after he touches on a raking cross from the left for Real's Helguera to haplessly deflect past Cesar for an own-goal. 51 Barca corner; Xavi takes toward Frank de Boer but the Dutchman can't get in a clean header. 54 Overmars gets around the back of Michel Salgado but Fernando Hierro clears at the near post. 57 Overmars again as he wins a corner; Overmars takes and Abelardo gets up, but he can't keep his header down. 60 Madrid free-kick 25-plus yards out; Hierro curls it around the wall and straight at Bonano. 61 Booking Carles Puyol; Figo's resulting free-kick 35 yards out on the right glides across the face of goal and near no one. Wasted. 67 Substitution Geovanni on for Rochemback. 68 Substitution McManaman on for Figo. 72 Corner to Barca; Xavi takes but McManaman clears. Barca need that goal now to have any hope. 73 Another corner to Barca, and again they can't make it count. 74 And then Luis Enrique blows a great chance when he shoots wide from a Kluivert lay-off 15 yards out. 75 Substitution Sergi on for Cocu. Free-kick to Madrid 25 yards out; Roberto Carlos takes but the wall holds firm. 81 Madrid free-kick out five yards out near the right touchline; played to the far post but nothing doing. 82 Booking Salgado for obstructing Overmars. 84 Another chance goes begging for Barca when Kluivert shoots over from 15 yards. 89 Yet another wasted chance for Barca as the ball fizzes past three Barca players closing on the area before Geovanni shoots over from 20 yards. 90 Four minutes extra to play, Barca free-kick on the edge of the area; driven in but Madrid clear. Full-time. It wasn't to be for Barcelona; Real Madrid go on to meet Bayer Leverkusen at Hampden Park in the Champions League final. Should have taken their chances, shouldn't they?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
