His claim comes after seven Zambians and two Georgians received suspended sentences following a court case into match-fixing in Finland on Tuesday. Wilson Raj Perumal of Singapore, viewed as the mastermind behind a criminal group that sought to influence the outcome of matches between 2008 and 2011, was found guilty of bribing the players and was given a two-year sentence. The nine former players of the Finnish League side Rovaniemi were said to have accepted bribes ranging from \u20ac500 (\u00a3440) to \u20ac40,000. The court said 24 Rovaniemi matches were fixed, and that Perumal's involvement was proven in seven of them. Eaton is concerned by the increasing number of players implicated in such cases and fears the match-fixers are targeting players from poorer nations, helping them to find clubs and then asserting pressure on them to play a part in scams. \"It is a form of trafficking,\" Eaton told the Independent. \"There are examples of players who have been abandoned because they did not perform. \"It is only anecdotal evidence at this stage, but it is clear. They [match-fixers] often target people from humble origins. They will go to junior competitions and recruit families of players basically through the attraction of cash. 'I can get you a contract, or a game in Europe or South America' \u2013 they will invest in the development of players and officials and then they expect payment. They want their cut. \"These people are criminals, they are organised. They are well funded and have a long-term plan. They are a real and present danger to the sanctity and ethics of sport. I would not underestimate its seriousness.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
