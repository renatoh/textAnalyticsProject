You move more slowly. You suck up experiences more intensely and you live the day more,\" the 53-year-old presenter said in an interview with Radio Times magazine. \"And you're much more aware of all the people all around us who have got really, really difficult disabilities who are looking after their parents, perhaps, and who frankly most of the time, like most people, I simply didn't see them. I wasn't thinking about them. That has changed. I do see them now, I do think about it.\" The presenter returned to his Sunday morning BBC1 current affairs show on 1 September after a nine-month absence. Marr said that, by and large, he was not a reflective person, but believed he had been altered by the major stroke he suffered while exercising on a rowing machine in his garden shed in January. The broadcaster described feeling like \"a sort of knackered version of myself\" after the stroke, which left him with mobility issues down his left side. Describing his return to live television, Marr said: \"Of course, yes, I was self-conscious. I normally use my body a lot when I'm talking. I wave my arms about. But I can only wave one arm around, so I'd fall over if I did it too much, and also my face is slightly less mobile, so I'm less inclined to smile and sort of make strange facial gestures as I work. I'm conscious about that as well.\" One of the projects that kept Marr busy earlier this year will air on BBC2 on Saturday night. He fronts an hour-long biographical programme on the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, titled The Making of Merkel, ahead of voters going to the polls in the German elections on Sunday. \"This will sound really pompous, but this is what I think the BBC is for, and the kind of film we should be doing more of,\" he said. \"It's a film I've been trying to make for a very long time. They said, will people watch it? I think they will.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
