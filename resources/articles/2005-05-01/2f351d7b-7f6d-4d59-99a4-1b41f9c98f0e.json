Brett's career selling computers at the local shopping centre is going \"gangbusters\", but 25-year-old Craig is impatient for more. \"I want to be effluent,\" she says, stamping her foot on the kitchen linoleum. Kath Day-Knight, a feisty divorcee with corkscrew blonde hair, does her best to console her daughter. \"You are effluent, Kim,\" she says firmly. \"You've got a mobile phone, a half-share in a home unit, a Hyundai and a DVD player. What more do you want?\" Kath and Kim are the creations of Gina Riley and Jane Turner, two Melbourne comedians who dreamed up the \"pussy bottom princesses\" for a one-off television sketch in the mid-1990s. Now, after three successful series of Kath &amp; Kim, which attracted audiences of up to two million and thus outrated most sitcoms on commercial channels, the series makes its British terrestrial debut on BBC2 this week. Catchphrases from the show such as \"noice\" and \"Look at moy, ployse\" have become part of the vernacular in playgrounds and offices from Perth to Sydney, and seem certain to become equally infectious over here. It's a huge compliment, says 43-year-old Riley, who says every sketch writer is searching for a catchline that, well, catches. Riley was born and raised in the middle-class Melbourne suburb of Canterbury. She left school at 15 - \"I ran off with the bass player's boyfriend,\" she says, without further explanation - but otherwise seems to have little in common with her brash comic creation. She and Turner usually do television and radio interviews in character, she says, because they are \"a bit shy\" and people would prefer to meet Kath and Kim - even talking to me, she sounds more comfortable when she drops into character. \"Some people can be themselves and be funny and off the cuff,\" she explains. \"But when we appear as ourselves you can often feel the wrenching disappointment.\" Riley's own accent is light-years removed from Kim's vowel-mangling suburban whine. She does not pronounce DVD as \"doy-vee-dee\", for example, and it is hard to imagine her wearing one of Kim's \"foxy\" navel-bearing crop tops. But Riley insists that most Australians can relate to Kath and Kim because the suburban experience is so familiar in a nation where neat quarter-acre plots with a pool and a barbecue on the patio stretch to the horizon. \"No one in Australia is a million miles away from Kath and Kim in some ways,\" she says. \"I think most of us have a pretty suburban upbringing.\" Riley's claim that Kath &amp; Kim is an affectionate parody of suburbia is, however, disputed by some. Australia still likes to think of itself as a classless society and the series has been criticised by some commentators as an example of middle-class comedians sneering at those further down the socioeconomic ladder. A Melbourne academic even produced a research paper that claimed that overseas students were uncomfortable with \"the way class issues were depicted on the programme\". Riley has had to deal with charges of de haut en bas before and is adamant they are without basis. \"Absolutely not,\" she says. \"That is not where the humour is coming from at all. We make absolute goats of ourselves and we're all laughing together. We make the characters bigger, of course, because we're making a comedy. But it is based in some kind of reality.\" Real, certainly, but Riley is not sure how her deeply Australian character will be received by British audiences. Some English friends have mentioned chavs to her, but she isn't sure it's the same thing. \"Chavs like bling, don't they?\" she asks. \"That sounds sound piss-elegant to me.\" Still, she is hopeful that Kath &amp; Kim will translate successfully. She and Turner have always resisted calls to make the humour \"universal\", and whenever the series is shown outside Australia, they get letters from fans who say they closely identify with Kath, Kim or well-drawn supporting characters such as Brett, Kath's doting husband Kel - a boutique butcher with a passion for synthetic fibres and \"man bags\" - and Kim's \"second best friend\", Sharon. \"With every single show I've ever done, they say, 'Don't make it too Australian, because it won't sell overseas,'\" says Riley. \"With this one we said, 'Fuck it, we have to do exactly what we want to do.' You can't be generic about families, you have to be specific.\" After three successful series, Riley and Turner are now pondering the future of Kath and Kim. There is talk of a feature film, but nothing has been decided at this stage. Riley knows it is important not to lose the essence of the show's success. \"When the Brady Bunch went to Hawaii, it all went horribly wrong,\" she says. \"You can't take your characters too far from where they are, or they get into strife.\" \u00b7 Kath &amp; Kim starts on BBC2 on Thursday at 10pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
