A poll of nearly 2,000 young people by the UK charity Girlguiding found that 55% of girls aged seven to 21 said they did not feel they could speak freely because of their gender. A further 57% said this affected what they wore, and nearly one in two said it made an impact on how much they participated at school. Sophie Wallace, a member of Girlguiding\u2019s advocate panel, said the results were disgraceful, and that girls and young women were \u201cbeing denied a basic right because of their gender\u201d. She added: \u201cSociety needs to understand that gender stereotypes aren\u2019t just harmful but a barrier to progress.\u201d The research found that gender stereotypes were reinforced by different sources, and arose from teachers, parents, social media, TV and other media. One girl, quoted in the report, said that a physical education teacher told pupils to do \u201ca girl press-up\u201d. She said: \u201cI stood up and told him that he was being sexist and that he was being offensive.\u201d Another girl said: \u201cSometimes when girls want to play sports in school, boys make fun of you. I want to play football but I can\u2019t because I feel uncomfortable and boys stare at you.\u201d The poll also found that 26% of girls aged seven to 21 thought PE was more for boys than for them. A third respondent said: \u201cMy mum told me that I should not be playing video games because that\u2019s a boy thing, and I said that everyone has the right to gaming because it\u2019s a hobby and if I like it then I like it.\u201d The findings also showed that girls believed certain subjects, such as science and maths, were more suitable for boys. Additionally, 42% of girls aged seven to 10 thought boys were better than girls at \u201cbeing strong\u201d. Those surveyed called for more to be done to challenge preconceptions. According to 95% of girls aged 11-21 the advertising industry should make sure adverts show more positive, diverse representations of their sex. Natasha Devon, an author and campaigner who works in schools throughout the UK said it was disheartening to hear how stereotypes were limiting girls\u2019 options. \u201cWe teach girls that pleasing others is the most important virtue and that being well-behaved is contingent upon being quiet and delicate,\u201d she said. Maria Miller, the Tory MP for Basingstoke, and chair of the Commons women and equalities committee, said the results showed that outdated stereotyping was damaging to confidence and needed to be tackled from an early age. She said: \u201cThe government has to show more urgency. There must be clear guidance for schools that leaves them in no doubt about their responsibilities to keep girls safe and tackle gender stereotypes, as well as [give] support for those experiencing harassment and abuse. We will be keeping a close eye on government action on this issue over the coming months.\u201d Wallace said the report showed \u201cglimmers of hope\u201d and most girls said they felt confident in their ability to protect themselves online and were unfazed about entering a male-dominated area of work. Tricia Lowther, from the campaign Let Toys Be Toys, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that so many girls feel strongly affected by gender stereotypes. When we look at the messages children receive from from toys, books, clothes and media, we can see that gender stereotypes are widespread. \u201cTake toy catalogues for example, even in 2017 the majority of images show us that girls are expected to be interested in dolls and beauty toys, while boys prefer building, fighting and racing. Children learn more quickly during their early years than at any other time in life and these repeated messages help form deep-seated beliefs that can be very hard to shake off later. \u201cTo tackle gender equality we need to ensure that childhood is free of stereotypes that have a negative effect on how children feel about their place in the world.\u201d Case study: Suzie, 19, student, from Scotland \u201cI thought about doing physics at school but decided not to in the end. I did an arts subject. It was where my interests lay but I do wonder sometimes whether it was a path decided for from me at a younger age \u2013 due to stereotypes. \u201cWe need to make sure we don\u2019t put genders on subjects and jobs, and make sure girls see women working in science. Gender stereotypes are insidious and affect us in lots of ways we don\u2019t realise. For example, girls being stopped from saying what they want to. I guess in terms of speaking out in class. I know I would rather not come across as pushy and loud, and that is partly something you learn through school about how girls should behave. That still affects me a bit at university. Sometimes I would hesitate to put my hand up. \u201cI am studying politics but I am not sure what I want to do after university. People always ask me if I want to be an MP, but one of the reasons I don\u2019t is because of the way female MPs are treated in politics. When you see women like Theresa May and Diane Abbot \u2013 put under so much pressure to be amazing at their jobs but also to present and look lady-like. They are under so much more scrutiny then male politicians and it\u2019s not something that is appealing. \u201cI do my best to challenge gender stereotypes whenever I can with my younger cousins. I challenge them to look outside the box a bit and encourage other women to do the same.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
