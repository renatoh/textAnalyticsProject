The commission for health improvement (Chi) will next week begin an inspection of Manchester mental health and social care NHS trust, one of the first four care trusts, after the suspension of four staff and the launch of a police investigation. The inspectorate will also investigate claims that other staff on the Rowan ward at Withington hospital were bullied and intimidated in an attempt to cover up the alleged abuse of older people. Chi's chief executive Dr Peter Homa said: \"Chi has significant concerns about allegations relating to the standard of care on Rowan ward at Manchester mental health and social care NHS trust. \"We can not let such serious allegations go untested. Chi will investigate the claims and the steps the trust has taken to ensure that vulnerable older patients are protected from unacceptably poor standards of care.\" The inspection was instigated by the Greater Manchester strategic health authority, which contacted Chi after a member of staff on Rowan ward reported the allegations in August. A spokesman for the health authority said: \"We were sufficiently concerned about the allegations of abuse and that other staff didn't feel able to blow the whistle to call Chi in. We want to establish whether the trust has systems in place to ensure that such abuse is dealt with.\" The care trust launched an internal inquiry in August, which led to the suspension of four unqualified support staff. But disciplinary proceedings are currently on hold while the police continue a criminal investigation. Kathy Armstrong, director of service development, who headed the internal review, said her inquiry covered alleged abuse over the past year while the police investigation went back further. Welcoming the Chi inspection, she said that Rowan ward would close by Christmas and all patients would be transferred to another hospital. \"Chi inspectors are coming in next week before we close and move the ward to Wythenshawe hospital later in December,\" said Ms Armstrong.\"While these allegations are awful, we have uncovered them and are dealing with them.\" Ms Armstrong admitted that the ward had suffered from serious staffing problems for several months and was now heavily reliant on bank and agency workers. She said: \"The ward is physically and professionally isolated as most services have already been transferred elsewhere in the trust. \"We originally planned to close the ward next June and transfer its services to a charity-run care home. This will still go ahead after its temporary relocation to the Wythenshawe hospital. We have had weekly meetings with the patients' carers and relatives to keep them informed of the situation.\" Finula Daly, chairwoman of South Manchester community health council, said: \"We have had a very stressful few months. However, we now expect Manchester mental health and social care trust to ensure the safe move of all patients and to demonstrate their commitment to the continuity of care and recognition of carers and relatives needs and anxieties.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
