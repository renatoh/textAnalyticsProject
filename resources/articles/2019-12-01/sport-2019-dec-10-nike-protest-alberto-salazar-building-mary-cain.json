Salazar, who was the running coach for the Nike Oregon Project, has been accused of humiliating and belittling Mary Cain and other female athletes. Salazar last month admitted he had made \u201ccallous\u201d remarks to athletes. He is also appealing a four-year ban for breaking anti-doping rules \u201cOn occasion, I may have made comments that were callous or insensitive over the course of years of helping my athletes through hard training,\u201d he told the Oregonian. \u201cIf any athlete was hurt by any comments that I have made, such an effect was entirely unintended, and I am sorry.\u201d Despite the controversy around the coach, Nike has not renamed the Alberto Salazar Building during its renovation, and his image still features prominently at the facility. According to the Willamette Week, around 400 Nike employees marched through the Nike campus on Monday with signs reading \u201cJust Do Better\u201d, \u201cNike is a woman\u201d and \u201cWe believe Mary\u201d. One employee, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Willamette Week they felt under pressure from Nike to follow the company\u2019s line. \u201cThe culture is about rank and file, and about fitting in. We\u2019re the teammates supporting our team, as soon as you break rank you\u2019re out.\u201d Some employees said Nike executives tried to \u201cwater down\u201d the protest, although a company spokesman, Greg Rossiter, denied the accusation. \u201cWe respect and welcome employees\u2019 feedback on matters that are important to them,\u201d he said. Cain said Salazar had pressured her to keep her weight down during his time as her coach. She says she stopped menstruating for three years, broke five bones because of osteoporosis, and began to feel suicidal as a result of his treatment. When Cain went public with her accusations, three other athletes \u2013 Amy Yoder Begley, Kara Goucher and Jackie Areson \u2013 also criticised Salazar\u2019s methods."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
