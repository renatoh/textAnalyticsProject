He managed only one win on his return in Montreal this month, and then was beaten in the first round of the Masters Series event in Cincinnati, losing to Marcos Baghdatis. These defeats were hardly surprising given his lack of match practice, although they obviously prompted speculation. \"The wrist is fine but he just needs to trust it,\" his mother, Judy, said yesterday. \"It's a confidence thing, that and building up his match fitness again.\" Murray, down to No19 in the world, reached the last 16 of the US Open last year but in his current state may do well to survive a couple of matches at Flushing Meadows, which starts on Monday. Tim Henman has called a press conference for Thursday in New York following an unsourced report that he intends to retire after Britain's Davis Cup tie against Croatia at Wimbledon next month. His agent refused to comment while his coach, Paul Annacone, appeared to believe Henman intends playing the season out, unless his back prevents him. The British No2 has been suffering from a degenerative problem for several years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
