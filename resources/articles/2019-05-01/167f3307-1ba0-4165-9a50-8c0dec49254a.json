The money has come through two GoFundMe pages that were established by other people after Connolly cracked an egg on the head of far-right senator Fraser Anning. The egging came after Fraser said the Christchurch attack highlighted \u201cgrowing fear over an increasing Muslim presence\u201d in Australian and New Zealand communities. Anning punched 17-year-old Connolly after the incident and Anning\u2019s supporters tackled Connolly to the ground. Connolly was taken away by police and released without charge. The GoFundMe pages had been set up to raise money for legal fees but the teenager promised to donate the money to help those affected by the attack in which 51 people were killed. In an Instagram post on Monday night Connolly wrote: \u201cFinally!!! After a huge amount of red tape, $99,922.36 has today been transferred to the Christchurch Foundation and Victims Support. \u201cFor those of you who don\u2019t know, there were two GoFundMe pages set up to help cover the cost of my legal fees and to \u2018buy more eggs\u2019. \u201cGratefully, Gordon Legal acted pro-bono for me so I don\u2019t have any legal fees. \u201cI decided to donate all monies to help provide some relief to the victims of the massacre ... it wasn\u2019t mine to keep. \u201cTo the victims of the tragedy, I wholeheartedly hope that this can bring some relief to you.\u201d A spokesperson for Victim Support which is coordinating donations in New Zealand confirm receipt of the donation from \u201cEgg Boy\u201d. Victim Support Chief Executive Kevin Tso said: \u201cFunds raised have been invaluable in helping those affected to rebuild their lives. The compassion and empathy shown by New Zealanders has been overwhelming. \u201cWe continue to engage with the victims and their families in the lead up to the final payment, which will be made before the end of June. Every cent pledged has and will continue to be distributed to the victims.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
