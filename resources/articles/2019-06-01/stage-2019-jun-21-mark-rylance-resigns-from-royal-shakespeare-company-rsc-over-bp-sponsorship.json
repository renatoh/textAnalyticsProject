Mark Rylance, who has been an associate artist with the RSC for 30 years, said BP\u2019s sponsorship deal allowed the company to \u201cobscure the destructive reality of its activities\u201d, which he said threatened the future of the planet. \u201cI do not wish to be associated with BP any more than I would with an arms dealer, a tobacco salesman or anyone who wilfully destroys the lives of others alive and unborn. Nor, I believe, would William Shakespeare,\u201d he said. The move will be a blow to the RSC, which said it was saddened by Rylance\u2019s announcement. It follows a series of high-profile protests by artists and campaigners against BP and other global oil corporations at UK cultural institutions ranging from the National Portrait Gallery to the Royal Opera House and the British Museum. Jess Worth, of the campaign group Culture Unstained, said: \u201cOpposition to BP sponsorship is now so squarely in the limelight that it\u2019s upstaging the art \u2026 There is no justification for promoting one of the world\u2019s most destructive fossil fuel companies in the midst of a climate crisis.\u201d In February hundreds of people occupied the British Museum in objection to its relationship with BP. This month a judge and several leading artists wrote to the director of the National Portrait Gallery on the eve of its annual awards calling on it to end its links to the company. A subsequent demonstration disrupted the awards ceremony. There have been other protests at different galleries in recent weeks, and on Thursday hundreds of people from Extinction Rebellion occupied the Natural History Museum to object to its hosting of a Petroleum Group dinner. Worth said: \u201cAs actors, musicians, artists and culture lovers unite in a chorus of disapproval, the RSC, National Portrait Gallery, Royal Opera House and British Museum must act fast to end their sponsorship deals or the damage to their reputations will keep escalating.\u201d BP, one of the world\u2019s biggest fossil fuel companies, sponsors subsidised \u00a35 tickets for young people at the RSC. Writing in the Guardian as hundreds of thousands of young people took part in the latest school climate strikes on Friday, Rylance said its involvement was no longer acceptable. The sponsorship \u201cmeans the RSC will continue pushing BP\u2019s brand on to young people who have \u2013 in huge numbers through the ongoing school strikes \u2013 told adults they need to step up their response to the climate crisis now,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSurely the RSC wants to be on the side of the world-changing kids, not the world-killing companies?\u201d Last year the world\u2019s leading scientists said there were only a dozen years to avoid the worst consequences of global heating, which is expected to bring drought, floods, extreme heat, food shortages and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. David Attenborough said this year that the environment emergency threatened the future of human civilisation. Rylance said he had been delighted to be associated with the RSC as a young actor, but his long-term objection to BP\u2019s involvement had not led to any meaningful change. \u201cThe RSC could turn this situation on its head and give young people much more value than a cheap \u00a35 ticket. They could give them the support of Shakespeare in their stand against our addiction to energy dealers who would willingly destroy us for a quick quid.\u201d The RSC\u2019s artistic director, Gregory Doran, and executive director, Catherine Mallyon, said they were saddened by Rylance\u2019s decision. \u201cWe recognise the importance of a robust and engaged debate in taking these decisions, especially in the light of the acknowledged environment and climate emergency,\u201d they said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the many ways that help us to establish lifetime enthusiasts for Shakespeare and live theatre and applies to all of our productions whether in Stratford, London or on tour around the UK.\u201d BP declined to comment on Rylance\u2019s decision, but said it was proud of its sponsorship which provided about 10,000 cheap tickets for young people each year. \u201cWe\u2019ve been supporting the arts in the UK for 50 years and over that time around 50 million people have enjoyed BP-supported activities and programmes,\u201d it said. \u201cOn climate our position is very clear. We recognise the world is on an unsustainable path, more needs to be done to fix that and the world needs to move to net zero carbon emissions in the decades to come. \u201cIn addressing the climate challenge facing all of us, it is critical that everyone plays their part: individuals, governments and companies such as BP. The answer will come through coming together, building understanding and collaborating to find real solutions rather than through further polarisation and exacerbating divisions.\u201d The company said it was committed to being \u201cpart of the solution and are working every day to advance the transition to a low-carbon future. We want a fast-paced transition to a lower-carbon energy system, which will require a huge re-engineering of the world\u2019s energy system. With our knowhow, relationships and capabilities, we believe companies like BP need to be part of the solution.\u201d Rylance said it was time for others in the arts world to examine their positions. \u201cI am resigning to lend strength to the voices within the RSC who want to be progressive, and to encourage my fellow associates to express themselves too. The children know the truth \u2026 In the face of addiction, tough love is the only path. It\u2019s time for an artistic intervention.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
