The two strikers face each other at White Hart Lane after Bent was sold by Spurs to Sunderland in the summer of 2009 before moving to Villa Park 18 months later, with the 27-year-old having now risen above Defoe in the international pecking order. Bent started the recent international against Spain, and Defoe was not included in Fabio Capello's squad for the two friendlies earlier this month. Asked if Bent, who has four goals in 13 England appearances, should definitely go to Euro 2012, Jordan said: \"I wouldn't say that, because he has to prove between now and then that you are still the player. And I think Jermain Defoe can do that. He is waiting for his chance, so there will be competition for Bent, and as Defoe showed against Fulham he had one chance [and took it]. It was heavy on Fulham but they had opportunities they did not take. We had Jermain, who came on, had one, and he took it. \"Whatever forwards you are talking about come the end of the season, they might not be in the picture now for the England camp. But you have to make a run. \"There will be few players selected who do not show form between now and then. You have to earn the right to be in the tournament and you have to earn the right to be in the team. \"If your form drops off, you might have scored the goal in the play-offs but it won't matter if someone gets ahead of you. You could be left out.\" Jordan would not be drawn regarding whether Bent should be England's No9. \"I'm not in that chair,\" he said. \"I think that is a dilemma that Fabio is paid quite well to solve.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
