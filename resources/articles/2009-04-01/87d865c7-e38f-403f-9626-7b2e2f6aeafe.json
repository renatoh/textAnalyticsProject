It reveals a staggering poverty of respect. It is the golfing equivalent of saying England's World Cup victory in 1966 didn't count because it wasn't against Brazil. Those Germans were obviously rubbish, then. The man lined up for the back-handed slight at Augusta is one of the nicest in the game, Padraig Harrington. Even in pursuit of a third consecutive major, even on the back of having been voted by his peers the PGA Tour Player of the Year, the Irishman only hovers at the foot of Olympia, in the opinion of the commentariat, rather than standing above the rest \u2013 until he gives Tiger a hiding. It is a nonsense. Woods was in the field at Carnoustie when Harrington won his first Open \u2013 and missing at Royal Birkdale and again at Oakland Hills in the PGA, yet Harrington's wins there were even better than at Carnoustie. Whoever wins in Augusta today, it will be because over four days he has held his nerve, made some great putts and recoveries and, in the end, got the better of the course. He will, with one obvious exception, have also ignored the royal presence of Tiger Woods. As much as golfers appreciate the fact that Tiger has dragged them along in his wake, ratcheting up their earnings maybe tenfold, they are elite performers in their own right. They deserve to be evaluated on their merits alone. All of us who are entertained by sporting excellence are either blinded to the point of adulation by champions (and sportswriters are no exception) or permanently waiting for them to fall over. You need only venture into the wonderful jungle of opinion in the blogosphere to be reminded that a version of Newton's third law is hard at work: for every reaction there is a reactionary somewhere waiting to disagree. Few \u2013 no, none \u2013 among us dispute Woods's ability to be constantly in contention. But winning cannot be his by right, as the man himself admits, while simultaneously expecting to do so. What separates Woods \u2013 all great champions \u2013 from the chasing pack is the fear of being dragged back to serial fallibility. That is what makes him obsessive in his grinding preparation, and inspires his attention to the tiniest detail \u2013 just as George Best would spend hours tutoring his lesser left foot into something like parity with his magical right, or Geoff Boycott would agonise over his corridor of uncertainty (before he invented the term). Then there is basketball's own Tiger. How about this: the man considered the finest ever to play bounce-ball, whom Larry Bird described once as \"God disguised as Michael Jordan\", was elevated to his sport's hall of fame last week \u2013 and complained. Why? Jordan feels he has been retired permanently, closing the door on the thinnest of possibilities that he can return yet again to prove to the world how great he is. Some would call that an illness. And maybe it is. There is a complication, though, for the man who we were encouraged to believe could fly. His youngest son, Marcus, made a big call last week when he committed to playing basketball for the University of Central Florida. This will not be a college career like any of his peers. Consider the moment when this obviously talented 6ft 3in guard goes up in a big game: the Jordan jibes will be hurled at him like arrows to his young heart. How can he possibly compare to dad? He cannot. Marcus decided to move a long way from home to ease the pressure \u2013 as if that will make a difference. He had some good news, though. Jordan Sr declined an invitation to coach at the university. That, truly, would have been a nightmare for the kid. His older brother, Jeff, already plays for the University of Illinois \u2013 so, already, there has been put in place a benchmark for Marcus to reach. We all love lists, and the American sports media love them more than most. The addiction inspired the Bleacher Report website to embark on a potentially disastrous item call The Comparison. And, yes, the first one made was everyone else with... Michael Jordan. The author of this provocative piece, Mike Carley, says with no hint of equivocation nor obvious recognition that he was undermining the premise of the exercise: \"There is no comparison to Michael Jordan.\" There follows a catalogue of reasons so comprehensive as to water the eyes. For Jordan in basketball, read Woods in golf. So, give up Padraig. Give up everybody, everywhere. Throw down your clubs and go home because there is only one God. Hallelujah."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
