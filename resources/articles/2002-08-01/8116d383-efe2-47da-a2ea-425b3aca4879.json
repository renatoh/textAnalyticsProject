Sir Alex Ferguson took that gamble on Diego Forlan and, however much the Manchester United manager would be loth to say so, it could cost the club a whole lot more than the \u00a37.5m transfer fee. Forlan's performance is crucial because United, the Premiership's leading scorers for the last six years, now have only three recognised strikers, with the misfiring Uruguayan the third as they enter the new season. In contrast, Arsenal and Liverpool are blessed with five each. For the moment Ferguson is standing behind his third front man. Last Friday, a few hours before United's first match in the Amsterdam event, he struggled to convince sceptical journalists that Forlan had been \"our best player during pre-season\". Forlan showed little to support that contention over the weekend. His greatest talent seemed to lie in disturbing the spectators in the upper seats of the Amsterdam Arena. His anonymity over 90 excruciating minutes against Ajax was such that, just after half-time, the public announcer mistakenly proclaimed that he had been substituted. After seven months and 18 appearances since signing from Independiente, the man Ferguson signed to replace the prolific Andy Cole is still waiting to register his first goal. Forlan admits he is suffering a loss of self-belief. It was, he acknowledged yesterday, a harrowing time. \"I can't explain what has gone wrong,\" he said. \"But it is with me all the time, even when I try to sleep. And the more I think about it, the harder it becomes.\" And unless he starts to show the apparent scoring prowess that persuaded Ferguson to buy him on the recommendation of his brother Martin, it is a fair assumption that the deposed champions will have to get used to being second best to Arsenal. A downbeat tone, perhaps, yet analysis of Ferguson's squad shows it to be talented but thin. The manager is dismayed by the lack of young players coming through, evidenced by his radical reshaping of the backroom staff. Should any misfortune befall Ruud van Nistelrooy or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the emphasis will fall on a player who is starting to earn unfavourable comparisons with some of Ferguson's more misguided purchases, such as Massimo Taibi and Karel Poborsky. With Van Nistelrooy suffering from a niggling shin injury, responsibility may be heaped upon Forlan next week in the Champions League qualifier in Croatia or Hungary. At least he is confronting the issue. He spoke yesterday of being homesick in his early days in Manchester. He did not have a car and was living in a hotel. Above all, the young Uruguayan has missed his sister Alejandra. When he was 12, growing up in Montevideo, she was paralysed in a car crash that killed her boyfriend Gonzalo. Forlan has adapted his \u00a3700,000 house in Alderley Edge so that she can visit. \"I came without anything. I missed my friends, my family, the culture of Uruguay and the South American people and there were a few problems,\" he said. \"But it is settled now. I have become good friends with Seba [Veron] and the young players. I am happy here. It's just that I need to start scoring.\" His fragile state of mind will not have been eased by his carelessness in Amsterdam nor the realisation that he, rather than Veron or anyone else, is now being perceived as the weakest United link. His team-mates have offered support but, elsewhere in the club, patience is wearing thin. One director was overheard towards the end of last season discussing Forlan's career as a junior tennis champion and wondering aloud whether \"he ever hit the net then\". Confronted now by a season in which United may well play more games than last, which will mean more squad rotation, Ferguson currently has limited options in attack. The experiment of playing Paul Scholes just behind one striker in a 4-4-1-1 formation early last campaign was unsuccessful. And Ferguson has reservations about deploying Ryan Giggs in a more central role because this unbalances the team on the left side. Ferguson, who once went 17 games without scoring for Rangers, knows all about striker's block and continues to show Forlan compassion. \"He's only 23,\" he said last night. \"I would be more worried if he was 33. But he still has plenty of time to improve. \"His link-up play and movement is good, he's fast, brave, two-footed and a busy wee bugger. Nine-tenths of his game is spot on. But he's like any striker in that he worries he's playing badly when he does not score. He has to trust himself in front of goal because he's leaning back all the time. He just needs that confidence.\" Striking defecit at Old Trafford Arsenal Thierry Henry Dennis Bergkamp Francis Jeffers Sylvain Wiltord Nwankwo Kanu Liverpool Michael Owen Emile Heskey Jari Litmanen Milan Baros El-Hadji Diouf Leeds United Mark Viduka Robbie Fowler Robbie Keane Alan Smith Michael Bridges Man United Ruud van Nistelrooy Ole Gunnar Solskjaer Diego Forlan"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
