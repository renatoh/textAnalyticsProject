After the match in Trnava on Sunday he was yet again contemplating the implications of a scoreless performance. \u201cThere was a lot of talk last year about me not scoring and I ended up proving a lot of people wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will talk this year as well. It\u2019s what they\u2019re doing now. But I am confident in my ability. I know that, if I continue doing what I\u2019m doing, the goals will come.\u201d They surely will, just as they did when he ended up claiming the Golden Boot having registered 32 goals for club and country for the second season in succession despite that traditional slow start. Yet that particular quirk of his senior career \u2013 that he has never scored a league goal before 26 September \u2013 is unhelpful at the moment. Kane, perhaps unfairly, came to personify England\u2019s struggles at the European Championship. The haunted look he wore in Nice, as the team panicked and surrendered to Iceland, came to sum up the team\u2019s exit. The Tottenham Hotspur forward had appeared bewildered as his free-kicks flew dismally out of play, perplexed as to how form could desert him so cruelly and completely. It was an ignominy which, in his words, \u201cmakes or breaks you as a player\u201d. Everything since has been an attempt to move on and a goal against Slovakia after three rather disjointed outings for Spurs would have offered evidence of recovery. Yet it was not to be. There was a fluffed connection at the near post from Kyle Walker\u2019s pull-back, his feet all a tangle, and the passing up of a chance to shoot as half-time approached that would normally betray fragile confidence. Maybe he would have enjoyed playing alongside Daniel Sturridge late on but he ended up making way for the substitute. Instead Kane\u2019s most significant contribution was to induce the pair of fouls from Martin Skrtel that led to the Slovakia centre-half\u2019s dismissal. It all seemed a little too selfless, not that the setup had particularly benefited him. His toils in Trnava could be explained by shortcomings elsewhere. Sam Allardyce\u2019s had been a frank admission that Wayne Rooney has far more experience at this level than the manager and so is almost better placed to read an international game. Yet the captain\u2019s willingness to retreat deeper and deeper as Slovakia sought to stifle left Kane a lonely figure in enemy territory. Too often in the first half his nearest team-mate was Jordan Henderson, who was supposed to be interchanging with Rooney in his forays forward. England\u2019s most prolific goalscorer may just have spotted the team\u2019s lone forward amid the clutter of Slovakia bodies but expecting Kane to make hay from any of his passes was asking too much. Isolated on the periphery, it took Kane 13 minutes for his first meaningful touch. Kane is not blessed with lightning pace and needs players with energy buzzing around him, dragging opponents out of position to create the space he can exploit. It was no surprise he was bolstered by Dele Alli\u2019s introduction and, if there is subtlety to Rooney\u2019s passing game, then he needs to be instigating the interplay much closer to Kane. The pumped diagonals to Raheem Sterling or Adam Lallana looked glorious when they came off but they slowed down the approach play and allowed the hosts to regroup and smother the only man in the centre. Kane would have been forgiven a certain exasperation, though he was in no mood to show it. \u201cWayne is a fantastic player, his passing ability is second to none and he has put some great passes in,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just diagonals but through-balls as well. As a striker, if you have the quality service behind you, you are always going to get chances. We have got the players to put the balls in and create, so all I can do is my best for the team.\u201d That was a diplomatic praising of his team-mates\u2019 talents which rather overlooked the fact that England, as a group, appear to have forgotten how to play to his strengths. Victory at least allowed Kane to reflect on the occasion as another step en route to full fitness at a time of the year when rustiness is an issue. The strain under which he is working, having featured in tournaments over the past two summers, with the England Under-21s and then seniors, may explain the sluggish starts. He did not register for Spurs a year ago until game nine and that 4-1 defeat of Manchester City, though he had scored in England\u2019s wins over San Marino and Switzerland earlier in September. It took the match against Bournemouth\u2019s particularly accommodating defence in late October, which yielded a hat-trick in a 5-1 success, to start the avalanche. \u201cAnd I still went on to win the Golden Boot, so that proves it was just a matter of time,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople might talk now or if I don\u2019t score in the next five or six games but it doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019m a confident player. I know I will score goals. I feel good. I felt sharp against Slovakia, albeit it was a tough game with the heat. This is only my fourth or fifth game, including pre-season, so I am getting fitter with each run-out. It\u2019s similar to what was happening last year with a shorter pre-season. Anyway, I put in a good shift for the team.\u201d At least he did not find himself taking corners, as he had for a while at Euro 2016, and Kane has had \u201ca laugh and a joke\u201d with Allardyce when the subject of being asked to adopt those duties against Russia by Roy Hodgson has cropped up. He has learned to chuckle at some aspects of the summer. A few goals would permit him to move on for good."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
