I don\u2019t know how I even know them, but I do. There is a house near me so lit up that Greta Thunberg needs to sit outside it in protest. If she doesn\u2019t, I will. Perhaps we all need a bit of cheer, or perhaps we are all a bit bonkers, or perhaps, as I keep reading, no one has a Christmas tree any more so that it looks pretty, but so they can put it on Instagram. That is what Jesus would have wanted, I\u2019m sure. Instagram fascinates me because I have never once put a picture on it but I still have followers. I guess that\u2019s modern life for you: wait long enough and, who knows, maybe you will get a glimpse of my very special tree and it will all be worthwhile. A word to the wise: don\u2019t bother. As with so many things, this is about \u201cfashion\u201d and size. Size matters. We used to be happy with a 4ft tree but now seven-footers are apparently selling well. Do these people live in castles? \u201cPre-lit\u201d trees are in. I am not sure what this means, although one year I did put candles on the tree, Scandi-style, and had to be stopped from lighting them. I have pyromaniac tendencies, despite having burned down my flat. We now have more lights than ever: 160 bulbs used do, now it\u2019s closer than to 500. Nativity sets are booming. Are we more religious? I hardly think so. My favourite remains the infamous \u201cmeat nativity\u201d that featured cocktail sausages as Mary, Joseph, Jesus and the three wise men Advent calendars are now full of gin, wine and super-expensive makeup. For grown ups, presumably, but who can possibly say? What a production. Whatever happened to paper chains and spray-painted twigs? I already wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned that. Some posh type is probably making a programme about it as we speak."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
