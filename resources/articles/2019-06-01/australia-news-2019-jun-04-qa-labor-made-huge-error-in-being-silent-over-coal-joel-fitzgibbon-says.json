Speaking on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A on Monday, the Hunter MP said Labor had remained silent on its pro-coal positions for fear of losing inner-city seats, and instead lost outer suburban and regional seats to the Coalition. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any anti-coal generating policies but we weren\u2019t prepared to talk about those things because no doubt we thought \u2013 and this is an admission from me and I\u2019m happy to make it \u2013 we thought it was going to cost us votes in city seats,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that was a huge error.\u201d The agriculture and resources spokesman, who suffered a 15% drop in his primary vote, with record swings to One Nation in his previously safe seat, has been repeating this message since the day after Labor lost what was seen as an unlosable election. He said he raised concerns that Labor\u2019s emphasis on its renewable energy policy, which was to achieve 50% electricity generation from renewable sources by 2030, alienated some voters. \u201cI warned my colleagues that our emphasis on one side of the equation and the omission to talk about the other was damaging us and damaging us very, very badly,\u201d he said. He said Labor should have emphasised that it would support Adani\u2019s controversial Carmichael coalmine \u2013 which received a key environmental approval last week, but still has several hurdles to clear \u2013 provided it cleared all relevant environmental approvals and the Indian company was able to secure finance. \u201cWe weren\u2019t prepared to say that,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will come to their own conclusions about why we weren\u2019t prepared to say that.\u201d Energy policy specialist Matthew Warren said the debate should not be about coal versus renewables, arguing \u201cit\u2019s quite possible to have a coalmining industry long after you don\u2019t have coal-fired generation in Australia\u201d. The Liberal MP for Boothby, Nicolle Flint, who was also on the panel, repeated Scott Morrison\u2019s claim that Australia was on track to meet its Paris commitment of a 26% to 28% reduction in emissions from 2005 levels by 2030: \u201cApparently we will meet them in a canter, is the phrase that is used.\u201d Australia\u2019s emissions have been increasing every year for four years. The new minister responsible for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, missed the 31 May deadline for releasing the December quarterly emissions data, in his first act in the post. Flint said the Coalition was \u201ctechnology agnostic\u201d on electricity generation but stressed the importance of \u201creliability,\u201d invoking the 2016 South Australia blackout as an example of what could happen if the supply was not reliable. Panelist Jimmy Barnes corrected Flint, saying that blackout was caused by storm damage to transmission infrastructure and not, as was incorrectly suggested at the time, due to an overreliance on renewables. Barnes also challenged Flint\u2019s description of a campaign that activist group GetUp ran against her as having \u201cencouraged a level of anger and aggression I hope that we never see again\u201d. \u201cI thought the Liberal party did the same thing with immigration,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cI watched every night and watched Peter Dutton not know the difference between a refugee and a terrorist, you know?\u201d That kind of fear campaign was \u201cvery, very, very uncool,\u201d said Barnes, who earlier on the panel described himself as a \u201ccloseted socialist \u2026 well, maybe not that closeted\u201d. Author Sisonke Msimang agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t think that GetUp was a particularly good actor but I think it\u2019s rich for the Coalition to talk about aggression in this campaign,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
