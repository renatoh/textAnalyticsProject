It has long been recognised that people suffering from psychosis tend to smoke more than most of the population, but it has generally been assumed they are self-medicating. \u201cHaving psychosis is a very distressing thing \u2013 hearing voices, having delusions,\u201d said Dr James MacCabe from King\u2019s Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, one of the authors of a new study. \u201cThe argument goes, why wouldn\u2019t people smoke to alleviate the distress?\u201d They might hope it would help with the symptoms and their impaired thinking processes and possibly counter the side-effects of antipsychotic drugs, he said. But an analysis of a number of studies on smoking tobacco and psychosis, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, now shows that smoking may be a causal factor in itself. The researchers found that daily smokers had an increased risk of psychosis. More than half - 57% - of people arriving at mental health services with their first episode were smokers, which is nearly three times the normal occurrence in the population. Smokers experienced psychosis one year earlier than non-smokers. \u201cWe can\u2019t say that we have proof that cigarette smoking causes schizophrenia,\u201d said Sir Robin Murray, professor of psychiatric research at King\u2019s. \u201cIndeed it is very difficult to point to any particular factor and say it causes schizophrenia. It is a bit like heart disease \u2013 there are a number of risk factors. You inherit some vulnerability and \u2026 are exposed to various things which increase the risk to your life.\u201d Cannabis is known to cause psychosis and schizophrenia. The authors say they could not be certain that all the studies they looked at had completely accounted for cannabis use. However, they are certain there is a modest effect caused by tobacco alone. There are biologically plausible reasons why smoking may be linked to psychosis. \u201cExcess dopamine is the best biological explanation we have for psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia,\u201d said Murray. \u201cIt is possible that nicotine exposure, by increasing the release of dopamine, causes psychosis to develop.\u201d A number of other drugs can stimulate dopamine production, including amphetamines, cocaine and cannabis. There are also genetic clues \u2013 a small number of DNA sequences (called SNPs) are known to be implicated in both schizophrenia and smoking. \u201cWhile it is always hard to determine the direction of causality, our findings indicate that smoking should be taken seriously as a possible risk factor for developing psychosis, and not dismissed simply as a consequence of the illness,\u201d said MacCabe. Prof Michael Owen, director of the Institute of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences at Cardiff University, said this paper, together with a previous study carried out in Sweden, \u201cmake a pretty strong case that smoking is of causal relevance to schizophrenia\u201d. He hoped that further genetic investigation might help untangle the relationship. \u201cThe fact is that it is very hard to prove causation without a randomised trial, but there are plenty of good reasons already for targeting public health measures very energetically at the mentally ill,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
