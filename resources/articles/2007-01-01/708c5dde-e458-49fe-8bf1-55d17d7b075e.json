How did you choose your baby's name, and how do you know which one is right for the baby? Remember, a name can affect how people relate to them in later life. How do you know which name should be \"the one\" for the child? DC, on the talkboard Before picking a name, put \"Dr\" before it. If they sound like a serial killer or someone likely to be trying to sell you dodgy herbal supplements, discard the name. AR, on the talkboard Also, imagine calling out of the back door, \"xxx, come in for your tea!\" or in Sainsbury's \"xxx, come here!\" and try to think whether those who heard you would snigger. RF, on the talkboard The Sephardic custom is a beautiful one. Name the babies after living relatives whom you admire and whose traits you feel would be an example for the children to follow. The relatives whose names you choose will feel honoured and will make every effort, as the children grow, to be a positive influence. TH, on the talkboard Do think about the child's initials. I have a friend with the initials PMT, and I first came across him in the context of his email address, pmt@domain ... poor chap. (Come to that, it was a right royal pain having the initials JR at primary school in the 1980s ... but my parents can be forgiven for not having predicted that, I feel!) JR, on the talkboard We chose names for all ours before they were born and it never crossed our minds to think about whether they looked like somebody with that name. I am slightly haunted by an unused girl's name, though. OW, on the talkboard Our daughter's middle name is the name of my grandmother. I always wanted to use it for a girl, but my grandmother died while I was pregnant, and it's nice to be able to pass something of hers on to the baby. Also, I was able to let her know before she died that her great-granddaughter would share her name, which made her happy. RR, on the talkboard We named our son after a Star Trek character, well sort of. A silly bit of \"What about Data? Or Worf\" led to \"well what about Jean-Luc, no, hang on, what about Luke?\" Sorted. BH, on the talkboard In my extended family, all the cousins on one side are alphabetised - the oldest is Amy, the second oldest is Barry, etc. My poor brother was the E and he landed with Eric. It's not quite right for a 16-year-old lad. In my boyfriend's family, it's even easier. All first-born sons are called David. Makes for confusing family gatherings. SB, on the talkboard My wife's family is full of names from Jane Austen novels. Three sisters: Emma, Jane and Catherine. They used to have a poodle called Darcy and now have a poodle called Wentworth. UM, on the talkboard We called the bump \"Attila\". After nine months or so, it didn't seem funny any more, or in any way unsuitable as a name for the baby. We didn't, though. We gave him a proper name. EN, on the talkboard My bump was Ptolemy - started off as a joke but we got used to it - luckily she was a girl. NN, on the talkboard Did you see their divorce coming? Your friends who have got divorced: did you see it coming? BE, on the talkboard In a couple of cases, I saw it coming before they got married. Only one has surprised me. RF, on the talkboard One yes (saw it coming before the ink had dried on the bloody register) and one no. TR, on the talkboard Only one friend has got divorced, and it wasn't a surprise to anyone. She now lives with her female partner, and that wasn't a surprise either. RT, on the talkboard The case I'm thinking about involved a very bright, very pretty, very bubbly woman getting married to an ineffectual, dull and not particularly attractive man of fairly average intelligence. If he'd had something out of the ordinary to recommend him (even a particularly sweet nature or generosity or something) it might have lasted a bit longer, but he didn't. JH, on the talkboard Most of my friends have got divorced; a couple of them twice. A very close friend's first marriage died of neglect; his friends gave him about 18 months' warning that this would happen. She was ambitious, if not particularly bright; he was bright, but intrinsically lazy. Also, she refused to bear his children because she was afraid of passing on some syndrome that runs in her family. He was dotty about kids, so the whole thing unravelled. His second wife was as thick as a brick and twice as hard as a coffin nail, but she banged like a belt-fed mortar and was willing to have kids, so he set up with her. I actually offered to drive him home instead of to the ceremony on his wedding day and sort out compensation afterwards, I was so certain it was a mistake. He thought I was joking. Five years and two sons later, it was all over. His view was that he had extended his line, so that was that. His boys will be raised as scum, which is punishment enough for his indifference. BK, on the talkboard Our friends recently got divorced - I was a bit disconcerted, because they were the only ones that seemed to bicker like we do, and I consider our relationship rock-solid. MM, on the talkboard My friend got married in his first year at university - because his girlfriend was a strict Christian and wouldn't sleep with him. He got his divorce papers the same day as his degree. VW, on the talkboard Just in the process of getting divorced - and suffering from being one half of one of those couples that nobody ever thought would, in a million years ever. And getting most of the blame too. I was very naive about how friends would react. Although no one ever really knows what goes on behind closed doors, it is surprising how little that stops people giving me the benefit of their opinion. EN, on the talkboard The woman of a couple I know well started coming on to me one day. I said, \"But what about your husband?\". She explained that they were splitting up. A bit disappointing as I was looking forward to having an adult affair, with the secret rendezvous and everything. FN, on the talkboard When I split up with my ex, one stupid woman at work, who I had previously quite liked, went into a long diatribe about how you had to work at relationships and there was no point just giving up at the first hurdle etc, etc. Now I am willing to admit that my ex is very good at his job and a good person to work with - however he was a complete cnut to me, and perhaps she might have considered that I just might know what I was doing and have good reasons for doing it. Very odd. VW, on the talkboard Any answers? A few years ago, when my daughter was about 19, I discovered she was gay. I had had some inklings, and asked her outright, and she confirmed it. My first thought was, \"I'll never be a grandmother\" followed by, \"What sort of a life will she lead? Will she suffer from prejudice or hostility?\" followed by, \"What will my husband/her father say?\" (He is vocally anti-gay.) I have accepted my daughter's sexuality, I love and am proud of her, but although she will answer questions, she will not volunteer any info. JF, on the talkboard Although they always accept our invitations and say how lovely it is to see us, my in-laws never invite us back. It is at least four years since my mum-in-law had my family round for a meal but my husband insists we see them so we have to ring and invite ourselves round. Am I being unreasonable, and what should I say? No violence though.
