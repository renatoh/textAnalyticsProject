These past 30 years young American filmmakers - most recently Jim Jarmusch with Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, the Wachowski Brothers with The Matrix and Quentin Tarantino with Kill Bill - have been more drawn to Asian martial arts movies than to the western, and in fact Edward Zwick's The Last Samurai is very consciously a western pursued in an easterly direction. The movie opens in San Francisco in the centennial year of 1876, a few weeks after the Indians obliterated Custer's cavalry at Little Big Horn and 23 years after Perry's incursion into Japan. Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a gallant Civil War veteran disgusted by the racist manner in which the US is destroying the culture of the American Indian, accepts a lucrative invitation to teach modern methods of warfare to the Japanese imperial army. In Japan he discovers that his task is to defeat the traditional warlords opposed to the emperor's determination to disarm the samurai and turn Japan into a modern industrial society. A magnificently staged pitched battle ensues in which Algren's ill-trained troops with their muzzle-loading rifles are routed by a much smaller force of samurai cavalry. Armed with bows and swords, wearing traditional armour and horned helmets, the victors come roaring out of the mist-shrouded forest like warriors in a Kurosawa picture. Algren's life is spared by Katsumoto, most feared of warlords (Ken Wanatabe), for his unflinching courage in the face of death, and during his captivity he is converted to the samurai's sacred code of honour and discipline. He also teaches baseball to the village kids. This film is in effect a version of those westerns like A Man Called Horse and Dances with Wolves where the hero turns against what he comes to see as the shallow, materialistic civilisation in which he was reared, and embraces a supposedly more primitive but in fact far richer culture. It might have been called 'Sports with Samurai'. It also has, in the relationship between Algren and the formal, inquisitive Katsumoto, some of the well-meaning pieties of The King and I. Zwick, who did such a good job on Glory, his rousing movie about the first black fighting unit raised in the North during the American War, brings a grand epic style to this somewhat simplistic material. There is a terrific attack by a band of ninjas on Katsumoto's headquarters, and two magnificent battles, the climactic one with conscious echoes of Thermopylae, Agincourt and Balaclava. As in Glory and Legends of the Fall, Zwick is attracted to the notions of victory in defeat and the romantic purity of self-sacrifice. His film is, however, a trifle earnest and overlong. Tom Cruise is lightweight and rather strained at the centre, unable to match the stature and presence of Wanatabe. At one point he says approvingly of a Japanese general that 'he's a man of small stature who nonetheless commands immense respect'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
