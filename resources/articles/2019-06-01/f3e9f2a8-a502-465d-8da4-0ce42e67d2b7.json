The contingent of players from Liverpool and Tottenham reported for duty at St George\u2019s Park on Tuesday and have enjoyed two training sessions with the national setup, in effect leaving them to play catch-up in their preparations for the tie against the Dutch. Southgate confirmed all seven are fit, albeit Jordan Henderson trained on his own before the squad\u2019s departure for Portugal, but suggested he may opt to select players with whom he has worked more extensively in the buildup to the two-game tournament. \u201cI have to assess all the players who were involved in Madrid,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThat was a unique game and a unique set of circumstances: whether you won or lost, the emotional and physical implications; the fact that the players only arrived on Tuesday, and there\u2019s a lot of tactical work that has been going on. \u201cWhen I took over, I remember talking about how everything had fallen on Wayne Rooney\u2019s shoulders whenever we\u2019d been to major tournaments. I was in Japan [in 2002] and everything was around David Beckham and whether he would be fit. We had to build a team where we weren\u2019t reliant upon one player or a couple of players, where the burden was shared, and people carried the baton at different times. And that we had competition for places and strength in depth. Motivation comes from wanting to win, but [also from] knowing there are players who can come in and take your place. \u201cWe have huge trust in all our players. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate putting any of them in. They\u2019ve played important matches for us. We went to Spain with Ben Chilwell, Joe Gomez, Harry Winks \u2026 you never know what these guys are capable of until they\u2019re given the opportunity, and they\u2019ve thrived on that.\u201d Kane\u2019s appearance in the final in Madrid was his first since damaging ankle ligaments against Manchester City in early April, and his performance was understandably rusty as a result. Yet his omission would still constitute something of a surprise given Southgate had previously suggested he would make an exception for a striker who has scored 17 goals in as many games as captain under his stewardship. The player himself suggested he is ready to play. \u201cPhysically I feel good,\u201d Kane said. \u201cWith injuries, it\u2019s never easy. I was out for eight weeks. You do as much as you can [to be fit], but I\u2019ve been training for a few weeks and played on Saturday. No problems.\u201d Southgate said: \u201cAll managers have really difficult decisions to make on selections when you have top-quality players who have won you so many matches. There is obviously a bigger temptation to do that. But you make decisions on the evidence in front of you. If you\u2019re at a club seeing players every day, you know where they\u2019re at. We have less evidence and have to make judgments slightly differently. You look at previous performances, club form, what the players are capable of, but we have to prepare a team we believe can cause the Dutch the maximum problems and expose the weaknesses we see. We do so with the mentality that we, as a coaching staff, have huge belief and trust in whoever is in the shirt.\u201d In Kane\u2019s absence, Raheem Sterling is expected to wear the captain\u2019s armband as he earns his 50th cap, though the City forward had felt compelled to apologise to Southgate earlier in the day after a press release issued on behalf of his management company late on Tuesday night had claimed he would captain the side in Guimar\u00e3es. I couldn\u2019t tell you [how that happened],\u201d said Sterling. \u201cI woke up this morning fuming. I hadn\u2019t had a conversation with anyone in my agency, so it was a strange one to wake up to. The first thing I saw after I came off the phone to my agent was Gareth down the hallway, and I apologised to him for what had happened. I don\u2019t know where that came from. \u201cThe captaincy is something that\u2019s down to the manager and not for me to decide. But if the manager did do that, it\u2019s something I\u2019d be proud and happy to do, for sure. That\u2019s up to the manager. To win a 50th cap will be a massive achievement for me, and something I\u2019ll cherish for the rest of my life, and so will my family.\u201d England, semi-finalists at the World Cup last summer, consider the Nations League an ideal opportunity to maintain recent progress and become the first winners of Uefa\u2019s new trophy. \u201cWe know the batting order is the World Cup and the European Championship, but now we have a new competition which only the best 12 teams could enter in our division,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe want to get into the habit of winning things. We have players who are hungry, and we want to be in with a chance of winning things. That\u2019s what this competition offers us. We want to leave here on Sunday with a trophy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
