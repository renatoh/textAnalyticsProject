The chief inspector of probation, Liz Calderbank, reported that serious violations requiring further court action occurred in 37% of tagging cases, and in a further 20% cases people were warned after minor violations. The report raises concern that the use of tagging \u2013 involving 80,000 cases a year at an annual cost of \u00a3100m \u2013 has become indiscriminate, and although justified as an alternative to custody is now mainly used as an additional punishment for low-level petty offenders who would not normally be sent to jail. The report also highlights \"deeply worrying\" individual cases, including one in which a man with a known record of domestic violence was sent back to the family home to serve his eight-week curfew despite the objections of his partner. He was subsequently charged with assaulting her. A dossier of 120 cases, relating to just two weeks in May and similarly published on Thursday by the probation union, Napo, also highlights concerns about the operation of the privately-run tagging system. Faulty equipment, claims of tags cutting out when offenders take baths or showers or roll over in bed, unnecessary recalls to prison and high-risk offenders not being monitored properly, were among the problems. In one case Napo reports the case of a man and his stepson successfully fooling a G4S security officer into fitting an electronic tag to the wrong man. Calderbank said the review found very little evidence that tagging was being used to prevent reoffending. Enforcement often fell far short of what the public had a right to expect, she said, and there was widespread confusion over whether the private tagging firms or the probation service was in charge of enforcing curfews. The critical report comes as the Ministry of Justice considers bids for a further big expansion of tagging to be introduced next April under eight-year contracts that could be worth as much as \u00a31bn. The scale of tagging imposed by the courts has more than doubled over the past six years, from 31,000 in 2005-2006 to 65,000 in the last year, with a further 15,000 tags fitted to prisoners released early on home detention curfews. \"Electronically monitored curfews are now being used as an additional punishment for people convicted of minor offences that would not normally attract a prison sentence,\" said Calderbank. \"Even at this level, however, punishment comes at a price. If the cost of electronically monitored curfews is to be fully justified, they need to be used more creatively and more effectively. \"This means providing targeted control and restriction, and helping individuals to change their offending behaviour.\" The inspectorate study was based on a random sample of 81 court-ordered curfews and 40 post-release home detention curfew cases. The inspectors found serious violations in 30 of the 81 court-imposed curfews, leading to breach action being taken' 18 were warned after less serious violations but successfully completed their orders. The probation inspectors said that they did not find evidence of technical failures in the tagging equipment and said both the security companies involved, G4S and Serco, appeared to fulfilling the terms of their contracts. But Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of Napo, said the inspectors' dossier showed the regime was gratuitously mechanistic, rigid and bureaucratic: \"The 120 cases gathered in just two weeks should cause real concern for politicians of all parties. \"The time is right for a thorough review of the effectiveness and efficiency of tagging to establish its impact \u2013 or not \u2013 on reoffending before the government embarks on any massive roll out.\" The case in which the wrong man was tagged involved George Lammie and his stepson, Gordon McKenzie, who were jailed for two years on 21 May after the judge at Teesside crown court heard how Lammie lied to employees of the security firm G4S, claiming he was McKenzie. McKenzie had been given a six-month community order on 21 February for obstructing a policeman and failing to surrender to bail, with a four-month electronically monitored curfew. But after his stepfather showed false identification documents to the security officer who went to the men's home the following day, the wrong man was tagged. It took G4S six days to discover their error. The justice minister, Crispin Blunt, said the new contracts, from next April, would provide an opportunity to implement the necessary changes, and explore the new technology and ensure it was used as effectively as possible. Blunt said: \"The call for a smarter, more integrated, approach is very much in line with the government's initiatives in reducing reoffending and protecting the public. \"Properly administered new-generation tagging can impose a punishment, promote improved behaviour and give victims reassurance. \"This report helps illustrate the potential as well as providing lessons on how to improve current administration.\" The justice ministry said it asked Napo to supply details of the cases highlighted so they could be investigated, but that the organisation had so far not done so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
