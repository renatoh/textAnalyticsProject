The atmosphere was frosty enough between the sides after boss expressed his annoyance at the the \"chanting and singing\" that Marseille's players indulged in after the 1-1 fourth round, first leg draw. Marseille chief Jose Anigo refused to apologise for the antics of his players. \"I will not say sorry because we celebrated in our dressing room,\" he said. But as the sides prepare to clash again in a packed and partisan Stade Velodrome, Houllier has angrily refused to let the matter rest, clearly feeling his team were insulted by disrespectful behaviour. Now Houllier has gone even further and is certain to stoke up the already heated atmosphere, saying: \"I felt they were indecent. They were chanting and singing in their dressing room. \"They must have felt it was a magnificent performance for them to draw away against Liverpool. Maybe there is now some over-confidence. \"I was a bit upset by the way they were singing as if the tie was over. I hope they were celebrating the game and result but not the qualification because that is still 90 minutes or more away for both of us.\" Liverpool are unbeaten in their last eight away legs and Michael Owen - finally back to something like his best form - has scored seven in those matches. He has already scored in two of Liverpool's three away ties so far in the tournament this term to bring his away goals tally in Europe to 15 in 26 away matches under Houllier, a fraction over a third of the 43 goals Liverpool have struck in those games. Houllier said of his front man: \"It is a great stadium, a great atmosphere and I would bet Michael will score a goal for us here. \"We have done okay away from home in Europe over the years and we are very aware of what is needed for us to get through in Marseille.\" Houllier accepts that winning in such volatile stadium will not be easy and that defeat will put huge pressure on him and his under-achieving side once again. \"As it stands we are out of the competition, at 1-1 with them having an away goal,\" he said. \"We know we must score to change that. But if we play at the level we can achieve we will give them more than a game. \"They made it very difficult for us at Anfield, they defended with two banks of five and four players and they were difficult to break down. But Fabien Barthez made two great saves at the end of the first leg to help them survive. \"Even if they play the same way that they did at Anfield we know that we can score. We had more chances than them. I do not think they have the players to just sit and wait, but if they do we will adapt. But I expect that we will have a bit more freedom and space to play our football. \"We must score in Marseille. We have enough experience, talent and personality to deal with that. The key away in Europe is tactical discipline and being able to compete physically. And also great character because you know you will have to dig in and wait for chances. \"But we know how to handle these games, we must keep our focus and most of our team have played around 50 games in Europe now which is very important to us.\" Houllier also accepts that Liverpool must contain danger man striker Didier Drogba, the Ivory Coast star who scored that crucial late equaliser at Anfield. \"We must stop the service getting to Drogba,\" Houllier said. \"He is a very good striker and can cause us trouble. But if we stop the ball getting to him and deny him any space up front than we will achieve our objectives against him. \"I am sure they will be thinking just as hard about how they stop Michael Owen.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
