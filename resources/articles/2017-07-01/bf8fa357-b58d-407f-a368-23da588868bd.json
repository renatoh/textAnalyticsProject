The last survivor to be pulled from the wreckage of the 7/7 terror attack at Aldgate that took place 12 years ago, the morning after London celebrated being awarded the 2012 Olympic Games. She remembers seeing one of her legs fused to the ceiling of the tube carriage she was travelling in but, incredibly, went on to make a new life as a double leg amputee, becoming one of the iconic figures of the Paralympic Games. The 44-year-old is frequently asked whether she would change things if she could. Her answer would surprise most people. \u201cIf I could turn back the clock I wouldn\u2019t change anything. I mean, I\u2019d really think about it, but seriously \u2013 hand on heart \u2013 I don\u2019t think I would. Because I believe I\u2019m a better person from going through that. I\u2019m more empathetic to people. I\u2019m stronger.\u201d Wright\u2019s position challenges conventional thinking around disability, and in particular disability sport as a lesser version of mainstream sport. \u201cI can\u2019t believe there are still people out there who think that about Paralympic sport,\u201d she says, mystified. Losing both legs is what made Wright a better athlete to represent Great Britain in sitting volleyball. She describes her physical advantage \u2013 lightning pace \u2013 on the volleyball court. \u201cWithout legs my body is able to do something I couldn\u2019t have done if I did have legs.\u201d It\u2019s a powerful inversion of our understanding of sport, a disabled body performing better than an able-bodied person. Wright\u2019s ability to embrace the atrocity that shaped her is evident everywhere you look at her home in Tring. Taking up most of one wall in the family living room is a huge piece of artwork made up of photographs of Aldgate \u2013 the tube station where the bombing took place, the Royal London hospital \u2013 so how does it feel to be reminded of those memories every day? \u201cI think it\u2019s important. This thing didn\u2019t just happen to me, it happened to all of us, if that\u2019s cathartic to Nick [her photographer husband] I\u2019m proud of that, I\u2019m proud of the emotional journey we\u2019ve been through together, it\u2019s made us who we are today.\u201d Her most treasured possession is a photograph of her family cheering her on from the stands at London 2012. One of the most striking images in Wright\u2019s autobiography, Unbroken, published this week, comes in a description of her first visit to a disabled toilet when she notices a pedal bin: \u201cIn a disabled toilet, in a hospital, specially designed for people in wheelchairs \u2026\u201d It is precisely this lack of expertise, she feels, that led to the public spending cuts that hit disabled people hard last year. Wright, even as a double amputee, had to be reassessed. \u201cJust before I went to Rio they were going to take my car, because apparently I can walk 20 metres with my legs on. I get a mobility allowance and the Department for Work and Pensions said everyone had to be reassessed in order to try \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 to catch the people who abuse the system. I filled out quite a few forms and they sent me a letter back saying I didn\u2019t qualify for my disability allowance any 2more.\u201d Wright spent two months trying to get through to case managers in an attempt to appeal against the decision. \u201cAt the medical reassessment I rolled through the door and the woman said: \u2018I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re here.\u2019\u201d Still, Wright had to fight her case. \u201cBefore I went to Rio they tried to pick my car up three times. Literally the day before I went to Rio \u2013 as a person with no legs \u2013 someone called and said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry we won\u2019t take the car.\u2019\u201d Wright tells the story on behalf of those who are more vulnerable than her. \u201cI know why the government are trying to do it but they\u2019re penalising people who have really got a disability, not finding those people who are abusing the system. And it\u2019s not just the financial side, it\u2019s the emotional and psychological stress. From the feedback I\u2019ve had, there\u2019s a lot of us with a permanent disability who have been questioned. I know there are cases that will be on the cusp but are my legs going to grow back? No they\u2019re not. The amount it must have cost [the government] for me to go through my appeal, all it took was a little tickbox to say I\u2019m an amputee. There\u2019s no point just doing something and it doesn\u2019t work anyway.\u201d Now retired from her playing career, Wright is treading a new path as a vocal advocate for the power of sport. Her experiences add depth to the discussions around women and body image. \u201cI woke up one day and I was literally half the person I was before. I was in hospital and didn\u2019t look at myself for seven weeks. I glanced at my face a couple of times and I was shocked at the scars on it. I had no whites in my eyes. They were red, filled with blood. I couldn\u2019t look at the lower half of my body at all. For someone who had a life before that, a girl about town, who liked high heels and shoes, it was huge. Before I left Royal London I looked in the long mirror in the toilet and I was mortified.\u201d Sport, says Wright, provided the psychological journey to accepting her body in its new form. Physically, it helped her to find her new centre of gravity as she struggled through 10 months of rehab learning to walk again. \u201cI truly believe I would not be here talking to you now if it wasn\u2019t for sport. I found volleyball at a time when I questioned who I was. The power of being around people who have been through something similar to you was huge for me. To be able to talk to other women \u2013 who have children and are trying to balance disability and work and motherhood \u2013 it improved my self-esteem when I was pretty low.The irony is that I found sport when I was most unable to play sport because I was seen as disabled. I believe we need to look at sport and use it more to create positive social change. I think we could do that and people are missing a trick.\u201d \u2022 Unbroken by Martine Wright is published on Thursday by Simon &amp; Schuster, priced \u00a318.99"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
