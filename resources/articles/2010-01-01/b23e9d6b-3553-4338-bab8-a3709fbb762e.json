At least, that's according to a press release distributed by - yes - Activision; a press release which gives no sales data, and which somehow both ignores and tacitly acknowledges the fact that the game is a spin-off from the Guitar Hero series, and therefore not strictly new IP. \"DJ Hero has transformed music gaming by marrying an innovative turntable controller and exhilarating gameplay with the biggest artists and incredible music from around the world,\" said Bobby Kotick the CEO of Activision Blizzard. In other words, DJ Hero has transformed gaming by being 1997 Konami title, Beatmania. This is also a rather dizzying turnaround from an interview apparently given to Game Informer in December, in which Kotick, then seemingly not so impressed with the title, said, \"...if you're going to make a commitment to doing something original, the odds are that you're not going to get it right on the first chance [...] We'll stick with it and get it right.\" What a difference a month makes. Still, it looks like a sequel is definitely on the cards. But seriously, what was your favourite new IP of last year? DJ Hero is a valid choice, of course, as would be Borderlands, Demon's Souls, Brutal Legend, Flipnote Studio or inFamous. What do you reckon?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
