His note was short, just half a side of A4 paper, and there was no sign of the other three pages he mentioned. Thomas Mair shot and stabbed the MP as she made her way to a constituency surgery at the local library in Birstall, West Yorkshire, on 16 June 2016, a week before the EU referendum. He told the two police officers who arrested him that he was a \u201cpolitical activist\u201d. A search of the 52-year-old\u2019s house revealed far-right and neo-Nazi interests. But once in custody, he gave police nothing more. \u201cWe\u2019re asking you why you\u2019ve done it,\u201d an officer asked. \u201cJo Cox\u2019s family want to know why she\u2019s dead.\u201d Mair sat, arms folded, defiant. When asked to give his name at the magistrates\u2019 hearing two days after the murder, Mair replied \u201cdeath to traitors, freedom for Britain\u201d. But at the Old Bailey trial five months later, he resumed his silence, leaving a plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d to be entered on his behalf. Jo Cox was the first female MP to be murdered in Britain, the first MP killed since Ian Gow was murdered by the IRA in 1990, but all we knew of Mair\u2019s motivation were the slogans he shouted as he carried out his attack. Witnesses variously heard: \u201cThis is for Britain\u201d or \u201cBritain first\u201d and even \u201cMake Britain independent\u201d. So after he was found guilty on 23 November, there was a stir in the press seats when the defence counsel requested that Mair be allowed to make a statement prior to sentencing. But Mr Justice Wilkie, presiding, was in no mood to risk a political outburst and further distress the victim\u2019s family. Mair was taken from the court in silence. While the ideology that drove Mair seemed in no doubt, I left the Old Bailey that day with many questions. We did not really know why he killed this popular MP \u2013 a 41-year-old with two young children. In some respects, the solitary, middle-aged man appeared an unlikely terrorist. After the verdict, Det Supt Nick Wallen described an \u201cantisocial loner in the truest sense of the word\u201d, someone so adrift that he could not even establish links with fellow fascists. Although he owned a mobile phone, Mair had sent just three text messages in as many years. The police had no idea how he had got hold of a firearm. Wallen also revealed that Mair had received treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and mild agoraphobia, but his pre-trial assessment had ruled out any severe mental illness. I wrote to Mair directly a few weeks after the trial, when he was in Frankland prison. I had little expectation of a reply. Some weeks later, a letter arrived from the prison where Mair said he was being held \u201cIN SEGREGATION \u2018FOR MY OWN PROTECTION\u2019\u201d. He wrote in black biro, using capitals throughout. The brief note appeared to have cost some effort, every inky comma carefully considered. But the further three pages of thoughts Mair said he had composed for me had been blocked by the censor on what he complained were \u201cSPURIOUS GROUNDS\u201d. \u201cI AM AT A LOSS TO SEE HOW WE CAN HAVE A \u2018DIALOGUE\u2019,\u201d Mair wrote. \u201cIF YOU STILL WANT TO TRY, THEN THAT IS FINE BY ME. BUT I DON\u2019T KNOW IF EVEN THIS SHORT NOTE WILL MAKE IT PASS [sic] THE CENSOR.\u201d A notice from HMP Frankland, attached, informed me that Mair\u2019s letter had been stopped for \u201cthe protection of the reputation of others\u201d. Over the following months I struggled to assemble a picture of Mair\u2019s life from other sources. Jo Cox was a passionate supporter of the EU and advocate for the rights of refugees, particularly women and children fleeing conflict in Syria, and there were calls from figures including Barack Obama to unite to fight the hatred that had killed her. But within little over a year, terror attacks devastated Nice, Istanbul, Manchester and Barcelona, white supremacists were celebrating the election of Donald Trump and anti-immigrant nationalist parties were gathering strength in Europe. In the UK, hate crime was on the rise. Those shouting \u201cBritain first\u201d were in the ascendancy. The open, liberal country that Jo Cox represented was in torment. The police had highlighted Brexit as \u201ca motivating factor\u201d for Mair. The murder of Jo Cox soon became part of the post-vote battleground. Remainers argued that Mair was at the extreme end of the leave spectrum; Brexiteers rushed to cast him as a deranged loner. Any hope of society learning something from the tragedy was lost. Streets and squares were named after Jo Cox in Belgium and France, while in our own bitterly divided nation MPs increasingly faced verbal and physical abuse. The language of far-right demonstrations \u2013 threats against \u201ctraitors\u201d and \u201cenemies of the people\u201d \u2013 began to pervade our parliamentary democracy. Boris Johnson has dismissed fears about inflammatory talk as \u201chumbug\u201d, but the example of Jo Cox\u2019s killing has been used in a number of threatening letters sent to pro-remain \u2013 especially female \u2013 politicians. Three years on, the atmosphere is still full of aggression and mutual recrimination. * * * I first arrived at Batley station a week after Jo Cox\u2019s murder and just hours after the shock EU referendum result. The constituency of Batley and Spen was one of many northern, former heavily industrial areas to choose leave against the urgings of local Labour MPs. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty much all Brexit here,\u201d a large man in a red Mickey Mouse fleece told me as we made our way towards the town centre, past semi-derelict mansion houses. One, with elaborate stone carvings, had tatty signs taped to the windows advertising cheap shots of alcohol. This former industrial powerhouse, the centre of the heavy woollen industry, had seen better days. The leave vote here was 60%, close to the depressed former coal mining towns to its south where two-thirds of voters had rejected the EU. Jo Cox had been one of their own here: raised in Heckmondwike and Batley, she was educated at the same grammar school where her parents had met. \u201cShe seemed like a nice lass but politically she weren\u2019t my cup of tea,\u201d the man in the fleece replied, in the weary tone I would hear a lot. He said the murder had made no difference to the anti-EU vote. \u201cWe\u2019d already made up us minds,\u201d the man told me, as we came to a halt outside an old Methodist chapel that now houses the Europa Bed company. At the top end of Batley\u2019s high street \u2013 with its Greggs, Betfred, a few charity shops and the back end of a large Tesco \u2013 are reminders of a more prosperous age, the Victorian town hall and opposite it the grand stone building of Batley library with its central clock tower. Austerity had threatened the future of this and other libraries in the area, which worried the new MP. Writing in a local paper in August 2015, Cox called them a \u201clifeline for job hunters without their own computer, slimmers, walkers, discussers, knitters and natterers\u201d. Mair was a regular library user, though he rarely borrowed books: with no computer at home, he came to access the internet. On 7 June 2016, Mair consulted the Wikipedia page of his local MP and watched a YouTube video of an American man shooting a .22 rifle in a field. It was nine days before the murder. Investigators believed that Mair had got his hands on a weapon shortly before his attack, though they could not be sure. A gun like the one in the YouTube video had been stolen from a car parked some 15 miles from Birstall in August 2015. But as Mair rarely ventured far from home, and then only on the bus, police were convinced he was not involved in what looked like an opportunistic theft. When forensic tests showed no sign that the weapon had been modified at his house, they concluded that it had been altered before Mair got hold of it. Whether the gun came first or the idea of murder, by 13 June it seems that Mair\u2019s mind was moving in that direction. That day, back at Batley library, he checked Jo Cox\u2019s Twitter feed. She described herself as \u201cMum. Proud Yorkshire lass. Labour MP for Batley &amp; Spen. Boat dweller. Mountain climber. Former aid worker.\u201d The day Mair viewed her tweets he also read replies to the question: \u201cIs a .22 round deadly enough to kill with one shot to a human\u2019s head?\u201d His morbid research continued the following day. He searched which parts of the body to target for the utmost harm and looked into a notorious Japanese case of matricide. A poster on the wall of the library advertised Jo Cox\u2019s constituency surgeries and Mair asked a librarian whether he needed to make an appointment or could just turn up. On 15 June, Mair visited the library closer to his home in Birstall. Staff saw him there often and recalled a man with a slightly florid complexion who did not make conversation or eye contact, who had a favourite computer booth that offered a little more privacy. That afternoon he wore a hooded coat, though it was June, and carried a number of bags including a large holdall. The police thought one might have contained the firearm. Mair spent an hour on the computer. He searched \u201clying in state\u201d, \u201clying in repose\u201d, \u201cpauper\u2019s funerals\u201d, \u201ccoffins\u201d. On the morning of 16 June 2016, Jo Cox had appointments in her constituency. As ever, her team were struggling to keep her to a strict schedule as she chatted with the people she met. It was market day in Birstall. CCTV images captured Mair lurking around Market Square, right in the heart of the village, from about midday. From his position, he had a good view of the library a few metres down the street. He was armed with a sawn-off .22 rifle and a dagger. As he waited for the MP to arrive for her 1pm surgery, he ate a chocolate bar. Jo Cox pulled up with her two assistants about 10 minutes ahead of schedule. As she stepped out on the passenger side, Mair took the gun from beneath his coat and shot her once. When she fell, he dragged her between parked cars and stabbed her 15 times. Bernard Kenny, a 77-year-old former miner, was waiting for his wife outside the library. As he tried to wrestle Mair to the ground, Mair stabbed him in the chest. Mair then shot the MP twice more as she lay on the ground. One bullet passed through her left hand which she had raised in self-defence. In court, witnesses described the attack on this slight woman as precise and controlled. When one of her aides tried to fend Mair off with her handbag, the MP shouted for both of her assistants to get to safety: \u201cDon\u2019t let him hurt you, let him hurt me.\u201d After the attack, one witness saw Mair walk away calmly, \u201clike he\u2019d done nothing wrong\u201d; another said he showed \u201cno emotion in his face\u201d. About 50 minutes later, almost the same time that Mair was brought down by unarmed police in a suburban cul-de-sac, Jo Cox was pronounced dead at the scene. Tributes began piling up on the cobblestones of Market Square, beneath the statue of Birstall\u2019s most famous son, Joseph Priestley, the 18th-century scientist and reformer who advocated the open exchange of ideas and toleration. A week later, they were still arriving. The small town was in shock. The murder scene was just a mile from Jo Cox\u2019s childhood home in Heckmondwike. A blanket of white roses, poems and teddy bears spread out beneath Priestley\u2019s feet. * * * Fieldhead council estate, where Mair lived, is about a mile north of the marketplace. A bright, postwar project, for its first generation of residents it was an escape from the overcrowded slums of Batley and Birstall. It offered people more light and a patch of garden; later, a pub and primary school were added. But over the years, the area was blighted by unemployment, poor educational outcomes, drugs and crime. In 2003, buses stopped running through the estate in the evenings because children would pelt them with stones. Today, there are few shops, no cafe and both the pub and community centre have shut down. Surrounding green spaces have given way to industrial hangars, warehouses and a retail park. Mair had lived at the same address since the mid-1970s when it was his grandparents\u2019 home, but most people I spoke to said they didn\u2019t know him well. He would occasionally tend the gardens of other elderly residents. Locals saw him as a harmless oddball, out in his anorak with his plastic carrier bags. Mair was born in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, in 1963 when his mother Mary was 17. His father worked in the lace industry. The couple\u2019s second child was born three years later, and sometime after that Mair\u2019s parents separated. Around 1970, the family moved south to Batley and the boys lost touch with their father. In the early 1970s Mair\u2019s mother began a relationship with a man from Grenada called Reginald St Louis, and in 1973 they had a son, Duane. Mary lived with her new partner and son in Batley, while Thomas and his brother moved to Fieldhead with their maternal grandparents. Mary and Reginald St Louis eventually married in 1979. The police would state later, in a BBC documentary, that his mother\u2019s relationship with a black man was key to the formation of Mair\u2019s racist views. I had an exchange of emails with Duane St Louis before he suddenly, and without explanation, stopped responding. He told me that his father found work as a woollen yarn spinner at the Thomas Carr mill. \u201cIt was racist in them days in Yorkshire,\u201d Duane remembered, but he said his father was a \u201cbig guy\u201d \u2013 \u201c6\u20192\u201d, plenty muscle\u201d, so \u201cthey didn\u2019t mess\u201d. Mair was 15 when his mother married St Louis. Anti-immigrant feeling was high and the National Front (NF), which wanted the repatriation of non-white immigrants, was stirring up unrest with intimidating marches through multiracial towns and cities. It was a time when Margaret Thatcher expressed sympathy with those who worried that Britain would be \u201cswamped by people with a different culture\u201d. Mary and Reginald had moved on to the Fieldhead estate with Duane after their wedding, and lived just a couple of minutes\u2019 walk from Mair and his grandparents. Duane said he had seen no signs of racism or extremism in his half brother. Friends and neighbours described the relationship between Mair and his mother as attentive and caring. He occasionally took her shopping, did her gardening or went for Sunday lunch. The day before the murder he had been round trying to help tune her television. After Mair\u2019s trial, his mother told ITV News: \u201cI never saw any of this coming.\u201d But the police sensed that Mair had harboured a deep hostility towards his mother as a result of her relationship with Reginald St Louis; that he felt a sense of betrayal. They implied that he may have intended to harm her after he killed Jo Cox. At the press conference after the trial, Det Supt Wallen pointed out that Mair had reloaded his gun after he shot the MP. A few days before that, he reminded us, Mair had researched the subject of matricide. \u201cRead into that what you will,\u201d he said. Mair does not appear to have had a job or close friends and lived with his grandmother until her death in July 1996. At 33, Mair was left alone in the house on Fieldhead, the TV in their once-shared living room now turned towards his armchair. These long solitary years apparently took a toll. In her few comments after the murder, his mother said her son had suffered from depression for some 20 years. Mair made few changes to the decor after his grandmother\u2019s death. There were floral rugs and a pink and blue colour scheme. Even the contents of the kitchen cupboards \u2013 tinned strawberries, evaporated milk and Rich Tea biscuits \u2013 were a throwback to the 1970s. The house seemed lifeless: no pictures on the walls or flowers in the vases, although Mair enjoyed gardening. It was spotlessly clean and ordered \u2013 everything had its place, tins carefully lined up, labels facing outwards. That sense of order extended to the bookshelf in Mair\u2019s bedroom, on top of which he had placed a statue of a Third Reich eagle. It was a well-tended collection almost entirely devoted to Nazism and the second world war. Specialist books such as Belt Buckles and Brocades of the Third Reich must have taken every spare pound Mair, who was unemployed, had. Mair\u2019s library included Holocaust revisionist texts but he also owned Deborah Lipstadt\u2019s Denying the Holocaust, which laid bare the pseudo-science, pseudo-history and antisemitism of such work. He owned numerous books about race and the evils of miscegenation. SS Race Theory and Mate Selection Guidelines was a compilation of Nazi statements on the importance of racial purity. Another carried an extract from The Turner Diaries, a notorious far-right novel from 1978 which imagined a scene in a future race war: \u201cThere are many thousands of hanging female corpses \u2026 all wearing identical placards around their neck. They are the White women who were married to or living with Blacks, with Jews, or with other non-white males.\u201d * * * When the editor of The Press, a Batley and Birstall paper, put out an appeal on my behalf for information about Mair\u2019s life, it drew just two responses. One of them implied Jo Cox\u2019s killing was some kind of pro-remain plot. Birstall seemed anxious to move on, blotting out the memory of a man who had stained the reputation of their community. But one local man with a strong connection to Mair\u2019s family did agree to meet me. Stephen Lees grew up on Fieldhead estate and was best friends with Mair\u2019s younger brother. He was also witness to the events of 16 June 2016 and gave evidence at the Old Bailey. We met up on a Sunday afternoon, at the Birstall pub that was on Mair\u2019s escape route that day. \u201cI seen Tommy as I were getting off the bus,\u201d about half an hour before the attack, Lees recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Ey up mate!\u2019 and he never said a word.\u201d Despite the men\u2019s long acquaintance, Lees said this was not unusual. \u201cSometimes he\u2019d say hello, sometimes just nod. It was hard to get a full sentence out of him.\u201d Lees\u2019s family were also Scottish. His father was a violent alcoholic and left when Lees was 10. At 12, Lees started a fire at his home. \u201cIt were a cry for help, I suppose,\u201d he shrugged. He was given a custodial order, and spent a number of years at a community home run by a Catholic order where sexual abuse was rife. It was after his release from custodial care that Lees became friends with Mair\u2019s younger brother, who was then living with his mother. \u201cHe was just one of the lads,\u201d Lees told me. \u201cLoud. Fighting when he was younger. Completely different from his brother Tommy.\u201d He remembers being surprised when he met Duane for the first time and he was introduced as \u201cour kid\u201d. Our conversation was interrupted every so often by friends and family members blundering in from the beer garden. \u201cGo on, lend us a fiver you tight cunt,\u201d Lees\u2019s nephew said at one point, thwacking the back of his head. Lees told me that Mair\u2019s brother was on the edges of the Service Crew, a hooligan firm which attached itself to Leeds United in the 1980s. Black footballers were often abused at Elland Road then, and NF publications and badges with slogans such as \u201cHitler was a Leeds fan\u201d were openly on sale outside the ground. In June 1989, Lees travelled with his brother and other Fieldhead lads to Dewsbury where a large British National party (BNP) demonstration was taking place. It was the time of the Satanic Verses controversy and the beginning of a period of fraught race relations in the town. The day ended in a \u201cmassive fight\u201d between local white youths and Muslims, with most of the BNP contained behind police lines. Despite all this, the far-right sympathies of Lees and his friends was superficial, he said. \u201cIt was just lads, you know?\u201d he told me. Lees felt certain that Thomas Mair was not involved in that day\u2019s beer-fuelled hooliganism. Ecstasy and acid house music soon replaced lager and football for Lees and his Fieldhead friends. Most weekends they would gather at Hartshead Services before setting out on journeys across the north to raves in abandoned warehouses and fields. \u201cNo, no, Tommy didn\u2019t get loved up,\u201d Lees laughed. For Lees, though, ecstasy ultimately gave way to heroin addiction and significant terms in prison. \u201cTommy looked to me autistic or to have learning difficulties or something,\u201d Lees said. He remembered a time he and Mair\u2019s brother had been to the house, but Mair refused to let them in and began cleaning the garden gate they had touched, using wet-wipes. \u201cHe were bad with OCD,\u201d Lees said, \u201cconstantly scrubbing his face and hands.\u201d The most he ever heard Mair speak was when he appeared in Birstall and handed his brother a new PlayStation 4. He had spotted it in a bag at the retail park and swiped it. Now and again others in the pub chipped in with their own memories. Lees\u2019s nephew told me that they called Mair \u201cMarigold\u201d on Fieldhead, because of the gloves he was often seen with for his gardening. A friend mentioned that Mair had been with him on the Priestley wing of Dewsbury hospital. It was the first I had heard that Mair had spent time in secure psychiatric care. Lees still finds it hard to accept that Mair was capable of murderous violence, describing his friend\u2019s brother as \u201cjust a loner and a bit odd\u201d. He was sure, though, that he would not have known how to get hold of a gun. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d Lees reasoned. \u201cEven I wouldn\u2019t have a clue. Someone must have got into his head.\u201d At the Old Bailey, where he was called as a witness, Lees remembered Mair facing him in court, staring straight ahead, no recognition in his face. It was as if they were strangers. * * * Mair was in his mid-20s when he first made contact with far-right groups. It was almost 10 years after his mother\u2019s marriage, and Reginald St Louis had already passed away. In early 1988 Mair wrote to a white supremacist magazine started in South Africa by a British man. Mair had come across the South African publication SA Patriot in Exile through an advert in a National Front publication. The letter referred to the anti-apartheid film Cry Freedom, which Mair said gave \u201cmorons another excuse to spout their hatred\u201d. \u201cDespite everything,\u201d he continued, \u201cI still have faith that the White Race will prevail, both in Britain and South Africa, but I fear that it\u2019s going to be a very long and very bloody struggle.\u201d Mair sent another letter to the SA Patriot, though this one was not published. Dated 2 August 1988, Mair praised the neo-Nazi White Liberation Movement. The group, which sought the removal of black people from South Africa, was banned later that year in the wake of a racist killing. Mair told the editor that he would be \u201chonoured\u201d if his letter were published and that he was happy for his real name to appear \u201cas I have nothing to hide\u201d. Over two weeks in 1999, a neo-Nazi called David Copeland planted nail bombs at three locations in London, targeting black, Asian and gay people. The most deadly attack, in Soho, killed three. Shortly after the bombings, Mair ordered a number of books which gave instructions on how to make explosives and firearms. Not long after he placed the order, Mair wrote another letter to SA Patriot in Exile, the first for many years. In it, he declared that the greatest enemy of the apartheid system was not black people or the ANC, but \u201cwhite liberals and traitors\u201d. Still, apart from such letters, Mair did not surface on the British far-right scene in these years, living a life of quiet anonymity. As he entered middle age, he was stuck in a setting where joblessness and disconnection were common. Fieldhead was, and still is, one of the most deprived wards in the region. In the early 2000s, a project, part EU-funded, was launched on Fieldhead to tackle the problems of social isolation, limited community activity and low self-esteem. When Jo Cox returned to the area as MP in 2015 she found that austerity measures had eaten away the strong sense of solidarity that characterised the place where she had been raised. \u201cI will not live in a country where thousands of people are living lonely lives, forgotten by the rest of us,\u201d she promised. Though he was lonely, Mair was not entirely adrift. For almost a decade, right up until he murdered Jo Cox, he was enrolled on programmes designed to help those with mental illnesses. His involvement began with a referral to the Pathways day centre, possibly after a period in secure psychiatric care. In 2007, he joined what would become known as the Electronic Village in Dewsbury, a centre teaching IT and other communication skills to improve the job prospects of disabled and disadvantaged people. Most clients were middle-aged and almost half came from the most deprived postcodes of Dewsbury and Batley. Mair spent some nine years learning new skills and then passing them on to others as a voluntary helper. The centre\u2019s chief executive officer, Karen Wilkinson, remembered Mair as vulnerable and lacking in confidence and got the impression he was being taunted by people on his estate. She said he struggled to make eye contact and rarely smiled. \u201cHe would talk to people but was very insecure around them.\u201d She got the impression that he spent Christmas alone. \u201cI think he was very lonely and sad.\u201d In 2010 Mair became a volunteer gardener at Oakwell Hall Country Park. While he was there, a local reporter interviewed him for a story on the importance of voluntary staff. In a very rare record of his words, Mair told the journalist that the work was helping him to overcome \u201cfeelings of worthlessness\u201d and was better than \u201call the psychotherapy and medication in the world\u201d. He talked of those suffering from mental illness as \u201csocially isolated and disconnected\u201d. A year later Mair was back at the Electronic Village, this time as a volunteer assistant. For a few hours every Friday afternoon he led a Flexible Learning Group which included a member with schizophrenia and an Asian woman with a history of self-harm. \u201cHe had a lot of time for her, he was like a guardian,\u201d Wilkinson recalled. She remembered Mair making balloon animals in one session for light relief. He was generally well thought of although one feedback report hinted at insecurities. Though Wilkinson never detected far-right sympathies or violent impulses, Mair did not keep his politics entirely under wraps. I met his fellow teaching assistant Tony Kelsall near Dewsbury town hall, where the Electronic Village had been run for a number of years. The son of a Barnsley coal-miner, Kelsall had been knocked off his bicycle at the age of 27 and suffered a severe head injury. The accident left him with problems concentrating and with his short-term memory. Kelsall got to know Mair when they worked together with the Flexible Learning Group. \u201cTom calmed down some of the quarrels,\u201d he told me. He learned that Mair had received cognitive behaviour therapy for his depression, but felt it had not helped him. Kelsall sensed a caring individual. Mair would always ask about his wife, who has spina bifida. But Kelsall also saw a political side to his co-worker. Mair expressed frustration about the presence of central European criminal gangs in the UK. Another time Mair became riled when, in a discussion on the American constitution, Kelsall remarked that Thomas Jefferson had fathered children by one of his slaves. The very idea was repugnant to Mair who, in common with white supremacists, hailed the founding father as an opponent of racial mixing. I was unable to link Mair with far-right organisations operating locally, though in recent times this part of West Yorkshire was fertile ground for the BNP. There was nothing on his bookshelves or his search history to suggest that he was especially agitated by issues that the BNP were exploiting \u2013 the building of another mosque, sharia courts, halal slaughter, grooming gangs. \u201cNobody knew him at all,\u201d David Exley, a Birstall man and a former BNP councillor for Heckmondwike, told me. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a member. He\u2019s never been to one of us meetings.\u201d Gary Stephen, another former BNP member and veteran of violent far-right groups in 1990s Yorkshire, claimed that neither he nor any of his friends encountered Mair. He referred to him as a \u201cbedsit loon\u201d. Wilkinson told me that she saw Mair for the last time on Friday 10 June 2016, by which time he had the gun and knew what he was going to do with it. His boss saw no warning signs and described her disbelief when she heard about the murder. \u201cIt was so far removed from the Tom I know. Isolation, that\u2019s the key to it, I\u2019m sure it is.\u201d * * * At the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Wilkie described the murder of Jo Cox as both \u201ca personal tragedy and a crime with great public significance\u201d. All seats were full as the trial began, and for one particularly powerful moment during the prosecution\u2019s opening speech, the court fell silent as a 360-degree police video from the immediate aftermath of the killing was played out. It captured debris, blood stains and what looked like a single shoe. As Jo Cox\u2019s parents and sister comforted one another, Mair remained impassive in his seat, detached. Jo Cox\u2019s family did not attend the trial on the day when her injuries were described. \u201cPeople are killed for what they represent,\u201d a 2013 UN Global Study on Homicide said of socio-political murders, arguing that victims are often anonymous to the perpetrators. But Mair stabbed the MP 15 times, and he had researched where to aim his knife. His attack was so vicious, it seemed motivated by intense personal rage. When Mr Justice Wilkie pointed out that Mair had searched the internet for matricide, knowing that Cox was the mother of two children, her killer screwed up his face as if he had heard something deeply idiotic. My seat was just a few feet from Mair, who sat motionless through most of the trial. Only after the verdicts when the victim impact statements were read out did Mair reveal the depth of his contempt. Mair was also on trial for the attack on Bernard Kenny, who was still too sick to appear in person. The prosecution counsel read Kenny\u2019s words: \u201cFear and stress were strangers to me until you sliced a knife into my liver.\u201d Mair was found guilty of grievous bodily harm against Kenny. \u201cI will not think about you again,\u201d Kenny said in his statement, and Mair rolled his eyes towards the ceiling. Jo Cox\u2019s widower, Brendan, barely glanced at Mair in court as he announced that he did not want retribution. \u201cWe have no interest in the perpetrator,\u201d he said in his own, devastating statement. \u201cWe feel nothing but pity for him, that his life was so devoid of love that his only way of finding meaning was to attack a defenceless woman who represented the best of our country, in an act of supreme cowardice.\u201d Mair did not react to these words, but as Cox described happy holidays with his wife in Bosnia and Croatia, climbing mountains, abseiling even after she discovered she was pregnant, there was a look of scornful impatience across his face. \u201cYou are no patriot,\u201d Mr Justice Wilkie declared to Mair in his sentencing remarks. \u201cBy your actions you have betrayed the quintessence of our country: its adherence to parliamentary democracy.\u201d Mair\u2019s expression remained blank. But when the judge told him he had also betrayed his parents\u2019 generation, those who made huge sacrifices to defeat Nazism, Mair cast his eyes upwards at the ceiling. Wilkie gave Mair a whole-life sentence to mark the \u201cexceptional seriousness\u201d of his offence. He would never walk free again. Even then, there was no defiant last outburst. Mair walked from the dock, prison guard on either side, in silence, unsteady on his feet. After the trial was over, I met with Dr Gwen Adshead, a former forensic psychiatrist at Broadmoor who had worked with Britain\u2019s most dangerous offenders. \u201cYou are trying to do what [Mair] refuses to do, to use words to explain something terrible,\u201d Adshead said. She told me such an attempt could only fail. \u201cBut that\u2019s all right.\u201d She felt his crime would have emerged from the slow burn of hostile, murderous feelings nursed over many years. It seemed to the psychiatrist a crime of envy, an act of \u201cmotiveless malignity\u201d. And yet, Jo Cox was not a long-studied target. As Adshead pointed out, she had \u201cdrifted\u201d into Mair\u2019s consciousness. Mair could have remained a bedsit fascist, flicking through extremist literature alone at home amid his late grandmother\u2019s floral decor. But in June 2016 \u2013 with a gun in his hands, at a political moment of great significance \u2013 he finally had his \u201cliberal traitor\u201d in his sights. More than three years after his crime, important questions remain unanswered, including how this apparently isolated individual came to be in possession of a rifle. On Fieldhead, the shutters are now off Mair\u2019s former home in Lowood Lane. A family has moved in, and I heard it had been stripped of its dated decor. The name of Thomas Mair is no longer heard around the estate. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 December 2019.
