Both lecturers and vice-chancellors have warned that a dispute would seriously disrupt students' exams and delay their degree results. The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (Ucea) took out a full-page advertisement in the Times Higher Education Supplement to criticise Natfhe and the Association of University Teachers (AUT) for \"rushing\" into industrial action and wanting to \"flex industrial muscle\" in the run-up to their merger. Meanwhile the AUT, which has already embarked on a ballot, said a pledge by university vice-chancellors to devote one-third of the income from top-up fees to staff pay had been confirmed by the former higher education minister Alan Johnson at a meeting at University College London. The union said he had confirmed that his assurance to the Commons was given following conversations with Universities UK. The universities argue this was not a formal pledge and that they intend to spend a substantial part of the new income on staff, including recruiting extra staff. The AUT general secretary, Sally Hunt, said: \"We have repeatedly asked the employers to honour their commitment to use the new money they lobbied for to sort out staff pay. The minister told parliament the truth and the employers' attempts to wriggle out of that commitment are as shameful as they are deceitful. \"We are keen to avoid any industrial action on campus this term and once again are calling on them to come back to the negotiating table to discuss how to spend the money they promised us. It's time for them to stop spinning and start talking.\" But Professor Geoffrey Copland, vice-chancellor of Westminster University, who chairs Ucea, stated in the advertisement: \"This latest claim asks for pay rises of 20% and more over three years - costing the equivalent of more than a half of all additional income to the sector, as opposed to their original claim for a third of the new income from tuition fees. Talk about shifting the goalposts! \"We agree that a lot more will be spent - on pay modernisation, extra staff to tackle workload and the increase in student numbers, more put into pension schemes and salary increases for 2006-07 and beyond. All this will cost well over one-third of the new fee income.\" Paul Mackney, Natfhe general secretary, responded that the claim was for one-third of all new income, including teaching and research grants and other income streams, to be used to increase staff pay. The claim that over half of all tuition fee income would have to be spent on staff pay was \"simply not true\", Mr Mackney said. \"It seems that, through increasingly belligerent press statements, the chair of Ucea is provoking further unrest. Ucea would be better served by spending tax payers' money on formulating an acceptable and long overdue pay offer rather than stoking the fires of industrial unrest.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
