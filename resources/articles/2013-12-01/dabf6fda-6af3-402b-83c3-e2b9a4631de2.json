Swann earned a cash bonus of \u00a3871,000 on top of \u00a3600,000 in salary and benefits for 10 months' work before her departure on 30 June this year, according to WH Smith's annual report, published on Monday. She also retained 1.13m share awards in the company, valued at \u00a311.25m at share price, reduced pro-rata to reflect her leaving date. Swann was able to retain her hefty share bonuses despite walking straight into a new job at SSP, which operates food and drink outlets for companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Starbucks and even WH Smith. As chief executive of the retailer, Swann was credited with turning the business around by cutting costs, moving away from less profitable goods such as CDs and DVDs and expanding the more successful travel side of the business. In the last year alone the company's share price has risen nearly 50% to 991p. Swann was replaced by her long-term deputy, Steve Clarke, who will receive a lower salary than his former boss at \u00a3480,000 compared to \u00a3525,000, the annual report reveals. That basic salary will not be increased for the year to August 2014. But Clarke, who earned a total of \u00a3971,000 in cash last year including benefits and bonus, was also granted share options worth up to \u00a32.08m, if he meets performance criteria. In the current year Clarke can earn up to \u00a33m including potential cash and share bonuses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
