After 12 months on the sidelines with an ankle injury the left-back is ready to return and Warren Joyce has promised he will try to involve him at some point, though for James the end of a long wait would be only part of the story. The dream coming true bit would apply to stepping out in front of a full house at Old Trafford, something James never managed to achieve in his three-year spell at United. \u201cThe only time I ever played there was for the under-21s in a pre-season match against Valencia,\u201d James says. \u201cIf I can get on, in a real game with a proper crowd, it will be an aim achieved, something I have always wanted to do.\u201d James is not unique in being released by United a few years after being signed as a promising local teenager, though the two senior games he played for the club tell quite a singular story. It is fair to say the 23-year-old prefers the memory of the first, when he made his United debut on their 2014 pre-season tour of the United States and marked it with a couple of goals against LA Galaxy. It was Louis van Gaal\u2019s first match in charge, David Beckham popped by the team hotel to say hello, and United ended up winning 7-0. Perfect. Just like a dream. \u201cI remember everything about that night,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I came on I felt nervous, my legs were like jelly, and then as soon as I scored the first goal all the nerves went away and instinct took over. It was just like being back in local league football. It\u2019s a memory that will live with me forever.\u201d That is just as well because his other memory, though equally powerful, is nowhere near as pleasant. A month or so after the American adventure James was selected for his first start and his first competitive game, the famous 4-0 League Cup defeat at MK Dons. If it was the low point of Van Gaal\u2019s first season, it was even worse for the ramshackle side he fielded. All 10 of the outfield players who began the game have left the club and James is in no doubt that the performance impacted badly on his United career. \u201cThe MK Dons game killed me and I can only fault myself for that,\u201d he says with disarming frankness. \u201cI didn\u2019t impress on the night and it was a bad result. It was difficult though. A few of us had been chucked in and it was a squad that had never played together against a team that was really up for it, a good technical side. You look at some of the players they had \u2013 Benik Afobe, Dele Alli \u2013 and you have to say they are not bad. \u201cIt was just one of those nights where a mistake leads to the first goal and then you go under a little bit. We needed leaders to pull us through and it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d James never played for United again and after a couple of loans and a few injuries had moved him further away from the first team he found himself ready to embrace the possibility of finding a new club. \u201cUnited is a club you never want to leave, so to make that decision is tough,\u201d he says. \u201cI have every admiration for Jesse Lingard, who was, and still is, a big mate. When he scored the winning goal in the FA Cup final last year I was thrilled for him, because he is someone who has had to stick it out at United. He\u2019s had a couple of loan spells and could have moved out, but he stuck with it and when his chance came he took it really well. \u201cYou could always see he had the ability. You have to be realistic though, it is not going to work out that way for everyone. If you come to a point in your career where you think it\u2019s not going to happen for me here you have to be a man about it and start looking around. I always think Danny Drinkwater is a good example of what can happen if you have to leave United. You cannot show what you are capable of unless you are playing games for someone.\u201d In what was described as a coup for the club, then in League One, James agreed to join Wigan, playing 24 games before injury struck. There was no time to start feeling sorry for himself. He was living with his brother, Matty, who was recovering from a much more serious cruciate injury. Reece missed the final months of Wigan\u2019s climb into the Championship, Matty missed the whole of the most successful season in Leicester City\u2019s history, which helped keep things in perspective. That was Gary Caldwell\u2019s Wigan, not the present Joyce version. When James heard his new manager was to be his old United reserves coach he could hardly believe his luck. \u201cI was more than delighted, I couldn\u2019t wait to work with Warren again,\u201d he says. \u201cHe used to come and watch me play last season just to see how I was getting on. \u201cI was at Wigan and he was still at United but that\u2019s the sort of character he is. We both know how difficult it is going to be at United, but we will give it everything we can.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
