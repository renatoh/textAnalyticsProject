As Cameron prepares to outline his plans to change the EU \u201cstatus quo for the better\u201d to the annual June European summit, the Irish parliament\u2019s joint committee on EU affairs calls for Ireland to be given a formal role in any negotiations. \u201cInstability in Northern Ireland following a UK exit from the EU could impact significantly on north-south relations,\u201d the committee reports, as it warns that some of the cross-border institutions introduced under the Good Friday agreement could be undermined. The Irish parliamentarians add: \u201cThe ongoing fragility of the Good Friday agreement was referenced. The need to actively engage with our Northern Irish colleagues was highlighted in order to raise awareness of the potential effects that a UK exit from the EU could have on the quality of life of people living north and south of the border, as well as on the border communities.\u201d The report, which is understood to reflect the concerns of an Irish government that has established a unit to assess the impact of a British exit, comes on the eve of the prime minister\u2019s first presentation of his reforms plans to an EU summit. Cameron will set out his demands for Britain to be exempted from the EU\u2019s historic commitment to forge an \u201cever closer union\u201d of the people of Europe, and for EU migrants to be barred from claiming in-work benefits for four years. British and EU officials downplayed expectations. The prime minister is due to outline his plans towards the end of the summit dinner on Thursday night, after a lengthy discussion on the Mediterranean migrant crisis. If that discussion overruns, the prime minister may have to wait until the summit resumes on Friday morning. Cameron, who discussed his plans with the German chancellor in Berlin ahead of a state dinner in honour of the Queen, said: \u201cThis is my first European council since the election and it\u2019s the first EU summit where renegotiation of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU is formally on the agenda. This presents an opportunity to get the negotiation underway and to kick off a process to work through the substance and to find solutions. \u201cIt will take us another step closer to addressing the concerns that the British people have about the EU. And closer to changing the status quo for the better and then giving the British people a say on whether the UK should stay in or leave the EU.\u201d Downing Street was encouraged when Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, appointed the most senior British official in the commission, Jonathan Faull, to head a new taskforce examining issues relating to the UK referendum. Faull will report to Juncker, who will also be advised by the commission\u2019s Anglophile first vice president Frans Timmermans. Faull is expected to liaise with officials from the EU\u2019s council secretariat and the prime minister\u2019s senior European adviser Tom Scholar, who will embark on technical discussions lasting several months after the summit. The council will examine Britain\u2019s demands for treaty change on giving Britain an opt out from the \u201cever closer union\u201d and on the changes to in-work benefits. Faull will be the key figure on changes that would be introduced through secondary legislation, Merkel\u2019s preferred route. Cameron will fly from Berlin to Brussels on Thursday morning to allow him to take part in a final round of bilateral meetings with EU leaders. The prime minister had aimed to meet, or at least speak to, all 27 leaders, but it is expected that he will struggle to speak to his Greek counterpart Alexis Tsipras, who is focused on a eurozone summit on the Greek financial crisis that will follow the EU summit. The impact of Britain\u2019s planned reforms \u2013 and the possibility that the UK could leave the EU \u2013 was highlighted by the Irish parliamentary committee\u2019s report. It warned that some cross-border bodies could become redundant. The members of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (equivalent to MPs) and senators said: \u201cThe committee also heard that [a UK exit] could also threaten other north-south bodies and would ultimately have a politically destabilising effect on the region, relationships and the Good Friday agreement itself.\u201d The committee said that a British exit could have a \u201csignificant psychological impact on those living near the border,\u201d as it called for the maintenance of the Common Travel Area between the UK and the Irish Republic. Dublin should also be given a seat at the negotiations. \u201cIreland must be involved from the outset in these negotiations based on the special status of the Irish/UK relationship and that the UK/EU relationship is a \u2018vital national interest\u2019 to Ireland,\u201d it said. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 June 2015.
