In a series of media interviews on Monday morning before the swearing-in of the Coalition\u2019s new-look ministry at Government House in Canberra, the prime minister also vowed to look at all possible levers on economic and tax reform. Turnbull faces an immediate policy debate as the Labor party releases its long-awaited policy on higher education, with the opposition promising a $2.5bn net increase to the sector\u2019s funding as a contrast to the government\u2019s twice-blocked plan to deregulate university fees and cut the public subsidy for bachelor degrees. The new education minister, Simon Birmingham, who replaces South Australian colleague Christopher Pyne, signalled a desire not to repeat the mistakes of the past, saying he would collaborate with education stakeholders \u201cto develop policy and to build broad support for any future reforms we need to undertake\u201d. Turnbull said the government would be considering the future of the higher education package, noting the Senate roadblock. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly an issue that\u2019s on the agenda,\u201d he told the ABC\u2019s AM program on Monday. \u201cThe government\u2019s position is that reform of the higher education system to promote excellence and greater diversity and choice in higher ed is very important, but clearly we\u2019ve got political realities to deal with in the Senate.\u201d Turnbull added: \u201cIf you can\u2019t get something through the Senate, I would say it\u2019s highly possible you could change it to something that will get through the Senate. This is what John Howard calls the iron laws of arithmetic.\u201d Cabinet was due to meet after the swearing-in ceremony on Monday. The wide-ranging changes include the elevation of Marise Payne as Australia\u2019s first female defence minister and one of five women in the cabinet, addressing one of the criticisms of Tony Abbott\u2019s male-dominated cabinet. Scott Morrison takes over the key economic position of treasurer, after Joe Hockey indicated he would quit parliament in due course amid speculation he could be in line to be appointed as Australia\u2019s next ambassador to Washington. Turnbull, when asked directly about the prospect of Hockey being offered the key US posting, said: \u201cI can\u2019t add anything more to what I said yesterday \u2013 that I expect that he has the capacity to serve the nation in the future.\u201d Turnbull\u2019s changes include the elevation of his key supporters, and the dumping from cabinet of several strong Abbott backers including Eric Abetz and Kevin Andrews. However, he also promoted Abbott backers Christian Porter and Josh Frydenberg and retained Peter Dutton in immigration, Andrew Robb in trade, Mathias Cormann in finance and Greg Hunt in environment. The prime minister, who was sworn in after a successful challenge against Abbott\u2019s leadership last week, described it as a \u201cwonderful new cabinet\u201d that was focused on the challenges of the future. He played down criticism from conservatives about the sacking of rightwing figures. \u201cThere are disagreements in political parties but you can see this is a cabinet of all the talents,\u201d Turnbull said on Monday. \u201cThere are people who have been promoted to the cabinet who did not support me in the recent ballot, there are several very dear old friends of mine who have offered to stand down and I accepted that in order to make room for others; so no one could suggest that this cabinet, this ministry has been assembled on any basis other than merit.\u201d Turnbull, who has also sought to allay concerns from the Nationals and conservative members of the Liberal party that he would overturn the Coalition\u2019s existing climate policies, repeated his support for the government\u2019s post-2020 emissions reduction targets and the other measures Hunt had assembled \u201cwith great care\u201d. But he also kept the door open to tweaking the policies if, as many observers predict, they will be inadequate in the longer term. \u201cThere will be changes to policies if they don\u2019t work as well as we think, or we think others can work better. None of this is written in stone, but I don\u2019t have any plan to change those policies because everything we see at the moment suggests they\u2019re working very well.\u201d Turnbull did not specify the sorts of changes that could be considered, but the Coalition\u2019s \u201cDirect Action\u201d policy could be \u201cdialled up\u201d into a baseline and credit emissions trading scheme by toughening the safeguards mechanism and allowing credits to be purchased. When asked about his plans for economic and tax reform, Turnbull resisted being locked into supporting an increase to the goods and services tax or broadening the base. \u201cThere are many levers in the tax system, many possible combinations of measures and it\u2019s important we look at all of them,\u201d he said. Turnbull said the fundamental goal was to improve productivity and living standards. Pressed on whether changes to the GST were a necessary component of tax reform, he said it was \u201cnot necessarily the case\u201d. \u201cThere are many different routes you can take,\u201d he said. Turnbull also indicated he and his wife, Lucy Turnbull, intended to live in the Lodge \u2013 the prime minister\u2019s official residence \u2013 when they were in Canberra. Frydenberg, who was promoted from his previous position of assistant treasurer to become the minister for resources, energy and northern Australia, told ABC\u2019s Radio National he enjoyed working with Hockey through the budget process \u201cand also through last year\u2019s G20 when he showed outstanding leadership\u201d. Frydenberg was uncertain about the prospect of an ambassadorship: \u201cYou know as much as I do \u2026 what we read in the papers is what I know.\u201d Frydenberg called for unity, drawing a line under his support for Abbott in Monday\u2019s ballot. \u201cI thought that he [Abbott] had an enormous amount to contribute and he\u2019d achieved a lot but that was the minority view,\u201d Frydenberg said. \u201cNow we move on and I\u2019m sure Tony Abbott is the first to acknowledge that, as he said in his very statesman-like performance in his final press conference, his job is to get behind Malcolm Turnbull and the new government to make sure it\u2019s a success because Australians deserve good government and at the same time they do not deserve [Labor leader] Bill Shorten in the Lodge.\u201d Turnbull told the Nine Network\u2019s Today program he knew what it was like to lose the leadership of a political party and it was \u201ca very tough business\u201d. \u201cI feel for Tony,\u201d Turnbull said, referring to Abbott deposing him as opposition leader in 2009. \u201cI\u2019ve got a pretty good understanding of what he\u2019s going through. It\u2019s a rotten time. He will need lots of support from his family and friends just as I had when I ceased to be leader some years ago. The show has to go on \u2026 we are focused on good outcomes for all Australians. In politics, that means that individuals sometimes have to endure tough periods.\u201d On the Seven Network\u2019s Sunrise program, Turnbull was forced to defend his leadership challenge in light of his past criticism of the brutality of Julia Gillard\u2019s ousting of Kevin Rudd in 2010. Turnbull said the removal of Rudd was a surprise and \u201ccame as a complete bolt from the blue\u201d, whereas Abbott had been given a warning shot when he faced a spill motion seven months ago. \u201cThere was clearly an issue that he was given time to change the party\u2019s or the government\u2019s fortunes and as it turned out, the party room concluded that he had not done that. That\u2019s why he was replaced,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cThe process if you like, was very different.\u201d When the Sunrise host, David Koch, noted Turnbull was not wearing the type of blue tie favoured by Abbott, the prime minister said: \u201cI decide the colour of my ties and the manner in which I wear them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
