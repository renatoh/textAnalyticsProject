The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that Britain could enjoy the same sort of access to the world\u2019s biggest market on the same World Trade Organisation terms as other non-EU member states such as the US, China or India. But it said membership of the single market provided additional benefits that might be lost depending on the deal struck by ministers in Theresa May\u2019s government. Ian Mitchell, research associate at the IFS and an author of the report, said: \u201cFrom an economic point of view we still face some very big choices indeed in terms of our future relationship with the EU. There is all the difference in the world between \u2018access to\u2019 and \u2018membership of\u2019 the single market. \u201cMembership is likely to offer significant economic benefits particularly for trade in services. But outside the EU, single market membership also comes at the cost of accepting future regulations designed in the EU without UK input. This may be seriously problematic for some parts of the financial services sector. Choices in these domains will most likely be far more important than any deal on budget contributions.\u201d The IFS said single market membership meant elimination of trade barriers not possible under existing trade deals. These included so-called \u201cnon-tariff\u201d barriers such as licensing or regulations that make it harder to export goods and services. The thinktank added that service sector exports were becoming especially important to the UK, accounting for 44% of total exports in 2015, up from 31% in 1999. Two-fifths of service sector exports go to the UK, whereas the Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) account for less than 5% together. \u201cSingle market membership is particularly important for financial services\u201d, the IFS said. \u201c\u2018Passporting rights\u2019 mean that UK-based financial firms can service EU businesses and customers directly. To maintain these rights would likely require membership of the European Economic Area. \u201cBut that would come at the potentially considerable cost of submitting to future regulations designed in the EU without input from the UK. The UK may have to make some very difficult choices between the benefits from passporting and the costs of submitting to external imposed regulation.\u201d The UK\u2019s newly created department of International Trade headed by Liam Fox is keen to negotiate free trade deals with countries outside the EU. The IFS said that new agreements would mitigate the economic cost of giving up single market membership."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
