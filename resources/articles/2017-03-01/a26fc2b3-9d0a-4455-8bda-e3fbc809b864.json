The Germany midfielder scored his fourth Premier League goal of the season in the 2-1 victory over Burnley on Sunday as J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side recorded a third straight Premier League win at Anfield to maintain their place in the top four. Can, who moved to Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen in 2014 for \u00a310m, has been receiving regular treatment on a calf for more than a year and has been to see specialists. A breakthrough was made at the end of February, with Klopp praising the 23-year-old after the match against Burnley for playing through pain. However, while his representatives have held preliminary negotiations with Liverpool over extending his stay, it is understood they have yet to discuss financial details, despite reports Can was demanding \u00a3100,000 a week. \u201cI read in newspapers it was about money but it isn\u2019t about money. We\u2019ve had a few good meetings and everything is fine,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is fine and I just wanted to say it is never about the money. It is about the future, what happens. The last few months the most important thing has been that I am pain-free and we have spoken more about that than the contract. \u201cWe will speak in the next few weeks and months and see what happens. I want to play injury-free. The meetings are with my agent but I am very happy at Liverpool. In the future I can play for many years at Liverpool.\u201d His representative, Reza Fazeli, first held talks over extending the player\u2019s current contract worth \u00a335,000 a week last year but they were put on hold while Can recovered from his injury. It is understood discussions will resume in the next few weeks, with Liverpool keen to tie down a player who began his career at Bayern Munich and has seven caps for Germany. Juventus have been linked with a move for Can but he insisted he has been focused only on returning to full fitness. \u201cI know I could do much better in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few problems, calf problems, but I kept going and I played. Maybe it was not good that I played and did not have a break but the last few weeks were better and I feel strong again. I know when I am fit and pain-free I am confident enough I know what I am going to do. \u201cI\u2019ve had calf problems for many years and it has been very difficult for me because I\u2019ve played out of position, which means more sprints, and 10 minutes into the game I\u2019ve not been able to feel my feet in a few games. I didn\u2019t like to go to the press and say: \u2018I am injured.\u2019 I didn\u2019t play well when it was my opportunity to play and it was my mistake. I play in a different position now and I don\u2019t sprint too much. Last week was good, against Burnley was good and I was pain-free. \u201cI feel good. I have to come back to the old Emre because when I am fit I know what I am able to do and I am confident enough to know I can play much better than in the past.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
