That was 15 months ago. Last month the Aussies of Macquarie walked rather than pay anything approaching 800p. Now come the Americans at Nasdaq with promises of 950p, and still the LSE says it's not enough. A casual outsider might wonder which side has most lost touch with reality. It demonstrates, again, that there's nothing like takeover action to shift perceptions of value. In this case, the LSE has done a great job in persuading the world that a structural change has taken place in the stock market. The growth of hedge funds, \"black box\" computer trading and arbitrageurs has significantly boosted volumes. The phenomenon is here to stay, it thinks, and Nasdaq seems to agree. Indeed, the Americans carry an air of slightly desperate would-be buyers, and so a bid of more than \u00a310 a share is possible. Nasdaq's problem is that their local market has been squeezed by the onerous corporate governance requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation so that most mid-sized foreign firms prefer to float in London. But how could Nasdaq - regulated by the securities and exchange commission - guarantee that Sarbanes-Oxley doesn't creep into London by the back door? One assumes they have a holding company model in mind. But an arms-length structure, if it is really to be watertight, would presumably make significant cost-savings harder to achieve. We will have to wait to discover how Nasdaq plans to square that circle but traditional users of the LSE - critically, the managers of all our pension funds - should demand a proper answer. This is the central piece of London's financial infrastructure. Allowing it to slip into foreign hands without solid safeguards that regulation will always remain in London could be disastrous. Even bigger is better Bad news for the environmentalists but good news for shareholders after ExxonMobil paraded its new chief executive this week in front of Wall Street's finest. Rex Tillerson is a rather more mellow character than his dyspeptic forerunner and has a natural charm of the sort that Lee Raymond often hid so well. But there was no softening of Exxon's hardline stance on hydrocarbons and climate change from Tillerson, although he did re-affirm the commitment to shareholder value and capital discipline. It was not just more of the same, however, as a main message. Tillerson said he wants to stretch Exxon's lead as the world's most profitable quoted oil company. He admitted any acquisitions would have to be big to make any material impact. Despite high company valuations, such moves have not been ruled out, he said. Countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia would not be courted too heavily: their governments knew where to come if they wanted the help of the world's largest stock-listed energy firm. A bit of Texan swagger, then, from Exxon. It looks like the same beer in a slightly different bottle. The Stop Esso boycott campaign organised by green activists looks like being busy for some time yet. The wrong move The property website Rightmove is the estate agent's friend. It has enjoyed extraordinary success in establishing itself as Britain's dominant property website - it claims about three-quarters of all property page impressions on the web - but makes users contact estate agents if they want to buy. So it's curious that just a day before Rightmove's debut on the stock market that the National Association of Estate Agents issued a report that in effect kiboshes Rightmove's strategic plans. The NAEA is campaigning against the introduction of home information packs, (HIPs) destined to be launched next year. They're expensive, bureaucratic and the majority of the public don't want them, says the NAEA. It wants them scrapped and believes the June 2007 deadline will be missed as there aren't enough trained home inspectors to carry out the job. The trouble is, you can only justify Rightmove's stellar market valuation if you believe in HIPs. Rightmove reckons the market for HIPs will be worth \u00a31.5bn a year and reckons by grabbing a 20% share it could make about \u00a350m a year. If so, its \u00a3500m market valuation looks plausible. But if HIPs do bite the dust, as the NAEA desires, then so does a central plank of Rightmove's strategy. Rightmove is a better-quality flotation than lastminute.com, which it is often compared to. For one, it makes a healthy profit - \u00a38.7m last year, or a 48% margin on sales of \u00a318.2m. But with shares at 392.25p, the valuation is breathtaking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
