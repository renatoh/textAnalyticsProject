Of the qualities, I like the Guardian, and, on the weekends, I read the Observer. I used to only read the Times and the Sunday Times. I think I follow columnists because I'm still a big fan of Simon Jenkins and I absolutely love Andrew Rawnsley. Magazines I have the Spectator on subscription; they have some of the best cartoons in the world. I absolutely love Vanity Fair, kind of salacious but pretending to be smart. If I'm feeling bleugh about everything I read Oprah Winfrey's magazine, O - I'm into all that life-affirming stuff. Books I'm a voracious reader. I'm reading Scott Turow's Ordinary Heroes and I've just finished David Baldacci's The Camel Club. I like Marian Keyes. My favourites are Anne Tyler and Helen Dunmore. Serious stuff tends to be holiday reading. A lot of biographies, most recently the Mao one [Jung Chang and Jon Halliday] and Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar [Simon Sebag Montefiore]. TV My husband, who is English, says us South Africans are addicted to British TV. I lived the first 26 years of my life without television, so what do you expect? I like Newsnight, Question Time and all that gubbins. Equally, I like Pop Idol and X Factor. Radio Punt and Dennis on The Now Show, and all the news quizzes. Ads The Sony balls ad for the Bravia, below, is just so beautiful. I'm biased because I'm so crazy about the stuff we've done on Jaguar, Peugeot and Citroen - I can never choose between them because the work is stunning. New media I use a lot of internet: bbc.co.uk, obviously, and I take a look at sennen-cove.com regularly as my house is there. Whenever I'm sad I go to look at the beach and pretend that life is fine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
