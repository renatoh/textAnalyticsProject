Omny? New York subway debuts tap-to-pay", "bodyText": "For unseasoned passengers of the dilapidated New York City subway, successfully navigating the turnstile with a MetroCard on first swipe can be a fiddly art form \u2013 as demonstrated by Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election campaign when it took her a grand total of five attempts to get through. But this week, some of the city\u2019s subway and bus passengers will have a more hi-tech contactless alternative to the flimsy swipe cards first launched 25 years ago as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) unveiled its new payment scheme, Omny (One Metro New York). From shortly after midday on Friday, passengers were able to tap their way into a selection of subway stations and buses using either a contactless bankcard or payment services on mobile or wearable devices such as Apple Pay. Initially the pilot scheme, which will eventually form New York\u2019s answer to London\u2019s Oyster payment system, will be available to passengers at 16 stations between Grand Central-42 Street and Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center on the 4, 5 and 6 lines and all Staten Island buses. Over the coming years it will be gradually rolled out across the network \u2013 scheduled to be completed by 2023. But there will be no physical Omny card until 2021, after which the MetroCard will be taken out of service two and a half years later. Launching the new payment method in the Financial District at Bowling Green station, where they had the first official \u201ctap in\u201d, New York City Transit Authority\u2019s president, Andy Byford, said it is \u201cthe quickest, easiest way to pay\u201d. Byford said similar modernised payment systems in London, Sydney and Toronto, cities in which he has also worked, have been \u201ctransformative\u201d. He added: \u201cThis is where New York benefits from seeing others develop products. We jumped straight to open payment and we\u2019re super confident it will work.\u201d The Guardian tested it with a contactless Visa card and within seconds of tapping, the new screen on the turnstile flashed \u201cGo\u201d. But following the launch of the pilot, passengers at Grand Central were divided on the new scheme as they continued to use their old MetroCards. At the ticket machine, where he was topping up his MetroCard, Brian Steinhardt, 48, a lawyer from Tribeca, said he would Omny in the future: \u201cI don\u2019t like the MetroCard. You have to swipe it 15 times. I mean, it doesn\u2019t always work, so it\u2019s frustrating.\u201d Damani Chietan, 19, a student and part-time Best Buy worker from Queens, had only just heard of the new system but was open to trying it with Apple Pay. \u201c[MetroCard is] kind of inconvenient sometimes. Instead if you had money on your card you\u2019d just tap it and go. So I think it\u2019s good.\u201d But others were less convinced. David McElroy, 32, who works in legal technology and lives in Brooklyn, was more sceptical. \u201cI probably won\u2019t be using this until contactless becomes the new card that the bank sends you right away, that you don\u2019t have to ask for,\u201d he said. Esther Murray, 50, a government worker from the Upper East Side, was worried about fraud. New Yorkers\u2019 reactions to Omny, she thinks, will be \u201cdivided 50/50\u201d. Tom Vink, 29, an events manager from Amsterdam on holiday in New York, tried to use his bank card to pay but was disappointed to find it didn\u2019t work because it is not contactless. But if he could, he would use it. \u201cThe old MetroCards are so old-fashioned, it\u2019s like travelling back in time,\u201d he said, laughing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
