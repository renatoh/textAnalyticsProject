Media coverage of sex education is influenced by both advocates and opponents, the study by researchers at University College medical school found. The report by Patricia Kingori and colleagues of the often emotive coverage of the government's teenage pregnancy strategy in England found wide, if unsurprising, differences among the national and regional press. Launched in 1999, the strategy is aimed at halving under-18 conceptions by 2010 and providing support for teenage parents and their children. A major element is the use of the media to improve understanding and change young people's behaviour. Of the articles the researchers identified on the subject, there were more in the broadsheets and they were more \"positive\" in tone than the middle market tabloids or the red tops - with the Guardian most positive of all (88% of its articles were rated positive by Kingori and her colleagues). In contrast the middle market tabloids had the highest proportion of \"negative\" articles about sex education (37.5%), notably the Daily Mail. The Mirror had fewer stories on the subject but the highest proportion (66%) that were negative in tone. Looking at coverage in the press for two years from September 2000 it was clear that sex education was driven from the headlines by events like the 2001 general election and the attack on the World Trade Center later that year. In June 2002 there was a peak of sex education stories in the national press linked to a report on its effectiveness in schools. The following month there was a peak in the regional press inspired by approaches from Parentline Plus, a charity advocating sex education, to several regional newspapers. Positive articles stressing parents should be more involved in sex education appeared as a result. The report, published in the journal Sex Education, recommends a more proactive approach in the light of this sort of initiative. The authors also acknowledge the success of \"family values\" campaigners in getting their message across in opposition to more sex education in schools, blaming it for increased promiscuity and teenage pregnancies. They conclude: \"A range of organisations concerned with sexual health have had successes in positively influencing public debate, or mitigating the negative tone of many reports. As we have seen, sexual health groups and organisations such as Parentline have been successful in influencing the tone of subjects that are of interest to them. \"Their advocacy work in raising the profile of 'the parents' role in SRE' on the public agenda has produced tangible and positive results. The 'family values' agencies have been actively promoting their views in the press, which has had a significant impact on negatively toned articles. \"Our conclusion is that on the basis of our research, a strategy of directly contacting high circulation newspapers with a view to positively influencing the tone of relevant articles and reports would be of considerable benefit to those involved in SRE, teenage pregnancy and related interventions.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
