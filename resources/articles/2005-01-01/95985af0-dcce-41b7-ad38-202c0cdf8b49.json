Part of the show this week was dedicated to the effect of computer games on kids. And guess what - the outcome was pretty positive. Apparently children who play games are better at strategic thinking, problem solving and focussing, although not quite so good at going to bed on time. While there was something slightly unnerving about a four year old playing Halo, it was good to see a programme about videogames that was balanced. Yes, there was a mention of kiddies playing GTA, but it was combined with a reminder that it is an 18 game. Interesting stuff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
