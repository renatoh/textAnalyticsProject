The Bank of England has launched a fresh \u00a3150bn stimulus package for the UK economy. Boris Johnson has claimed that people will be able to have \u201cas normal a Christmas as possible\u201d if they comply with the lockdown rules. Speaking at his press conference this evening, he said: I have every confidence, if we follow this package of measures [ie, the lockdown] in the way that we can, as we have done before, I have no doubt that people will be able to have as normal a Christmas as possible and that we will be able to get things open before Christmas as well. The second national lockdown in England has been caused in part by a lack of public compliance, Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, has said, adding that it will be a \u201chuge challenge\u201d to get the public to follow the strict rules this time. Boris Johnson has been under pressure to follow European leaders and warn Donald Trump that he will be damaging democracy worldwide if he continues to allege ballot fraud in the US presidential election without any supporting evidence. Sainsbury\u2019s has said the supply of some fish, dairy and meat products to its stores in Northern Ireland could be significantly reduced from January because of Brexit. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. And of course, for the latest from America, do follow our US presidential election results live blog. Anthony Costello, a paediatrician, former World Health Organization director and member of Independent Sage (a group of scientists critical of the government\u2019s approach), has criticised Boris Johnson\u2019s responses to questions about test and trace. (See 5.45pm.) Germany and Sweden are being removed from England\u2019s travel corridor following an increase in Covid-19 cases, meaning arrivals from the countries will be forced to isolate for two weeks. Under the newly imposed month-long lockdown in England, people are not allowed to travel abroad on holiday, with those breaching the rules facing fines \u2013 up to \u00a36,400 for repeat offenders. The corridor changes come into effect at 4am on Saturday and have limited immediate impact given the existing lockdown but could affect travel plans in future in the event of countrywide restrictions being eased. There has been a 75% increase in total Covid cases in Germany over the past four weeks, the Department for Transport said, with new cases per week increasing by 35% in Sweden over the same period. Johnson is wrapping up now. He says he must \u201calas\u201d ask people to stay at home and save lives. And that\u2019s it. Q: More than 1.2 million people are waiting for an NHS test. But the NHS is short of testing equipment. Will it get more resources? Johnson says the pressure on the NHS caused by Covid has affected other NHS services. But he says he announced more funding for the NHS just before Covid began. You need staff too, he says. He is recruiting more nurses, he says. Stevens says the NHS needs to substantially expand its diagnostic capacity. It won\u2019t just put them in hospitals. It wants to have them on the high street too, to expand accessibility. In the summer there were predictions that the waiting list could reach 10m, he says. But he says that is now not the case, because of the work done in tackling the backlog. He says, if there is one silver lining, it is that NHS staff have inspired a new generation to join up. The intake of student nurses this autumn is the biggest ever, he says. Q: Wouldn\u2019t it be better to spend the money going on NHS test and trace on contact tracing by local public health officials instead? Johnson says he understands people\u2019s frustrations with it. But they are improving rapidly at the moment, he says. (See 11.55am.) He says he does not accept that it has had no effect. It has not been as effective as people might like. But it has helped identify where the disease is, which has helped to control it, he says. Mass testing is full of promise, he says. It offers \u201ca real way forward\u201d. He says getting people to self-isolate when they need to has been a real problem. Stevens says there are three lines of defence: social distancing; test and trace; and what happens in hospitals. Having tests that pick up asymptomatic cases (as mass testing should) should make a difference, he says. Q: What is your response to concerns about the data presented by government? (See 4.11pm.) Johnson says the government is happy to share the data it has. He says some facts are irrefutable. He quotes figures for the increase in hospital cases. Q: Won\u2019t we have to live with restrictions for some time? Stevens says the NHS is prepared for coronavirus. Q: Can you get Tory MPs to vote for further restrictions if needed on 2 December? Johnson says he has \u201cevery confidence\u201d that the measures announced for November will work. Q: Your own MPs say they won\u2019t support you. Johnson says he was very grateful for their support yesterday. He says the government could have won with its own votes. He thinks, as a result of technical advances, we will be in a different situation then. Q: Is it realistic to think Christmas can go ahead? Won\u2019t that just send the virus soaring again? Johnson says the overwhelming number of people will work to get it down. He says he thinks we will be able to have \u201cas normal a Christmas as possible\u201d. I have every confidence, if we follow this package of measures [ie, the lockdown] in the way that we can, as we have done before, I have no doubt that people will be able to have as normal a Christmas as possible and that we will be able to get things open before Christmas as well. Stevens says we have been able to drive down the virus before, to \u201cknock this thing off its perch\u201d. Q: What do you say to people who lost their jobs before you extended furlough? Johnson says it has been one of the most generous and imaginative schemes applied. It has been extended exactly to provide that certainty. He says it was right to try alternative approaches while the R was suppressed. Q: Was the lockdown eased too quickly? Stevens says there was a substantial reduction in numbers over the summer. The NHS used that time to catch up. But, when the facts change, you have to change approach, he says. Q: What consideration has been given to the prospect that vaccines might have only a limited effect? Johnson says there is a \u201ctripod\u201d of medical interventions: treatments, vaccines, and testing. He says the Liverpool mass testing experiment has been seen nowhere else in the world, apart from in Slovakia. He says results will be available immediately. That means people can be told to isolate if they are positive. If they are negative, they can behave in a more normal way. He says the \u201cnumber of shots raining down on goal\u201d from the scientists is considerable, and some will get through. Stevens says some of the vaccines likely to come through most quickly are some of the cleverest. The more conventional ones will come on stream next year, he says. The first question comes from a member of the public who wants to know why outside football has been banned. Johnson says he would love to allow this to continue. But it is just 28 days, he says. Stevens says the NHS needs our help too. There is a slogan \u201cprotect us to protect you\u201d, he says. NHS staff get Covid too, he says. He says we cannot stop cancer or heart attacks or strokes. But we can reduce the spread of coronavirus in the community, and that is what we need to do. Stevens says new treatments are available. For some patients, death rates in hospital have halved. More people are getting flu vaccines. Hospitals are being expanded, and systems are in place to separate Covid and non-Covid patients. Doctors are going \u201chammer and tongs\u201d to catch up with the procedures delayed during wave one, he says. Stevens is now showing a video. It shows that it can take up to five days for someone to get ill after being infected, between two and five days for them to get to hospital if they are seriously ill, and then between nine and 19 days for them to leave hospital, either dead or discharged. So today\u2019s infections are the hospital order book for two weeks\u2019 time, he says. Stevens is talking about the second wave. He presents this graph, showing how the hospital numbers have gone up. Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, says he asked NHS staff what message they would like him to pass on to viewers. First, they wanted him to say this second wave of coronavirus is real. Second, they wanted to say the NHS has been working hard to catch up. But, third, they wanted to say that what happened would depend on people\u2019s behaviour. Johnson says two thirds of homeless people who were helped during the first lockdown are still off the streets. And he says today the government can announce it is spending a further \u00a315m on support for rough sleepers. Johnson says the mass testing pilot will start in Liverpool tomorrow. And there is a very real chance of safe and effective vaccines, he says. Johnson reads out the latest coronavirus figures. New rules are in place from today, he says. The full rules are on the government\u2019s website. He says he knows how difficult this is for people. People are anxious and fed up, he says. But this is not a repeat of the spring. The schools are staying open. And these rules are time-limited. After 2 December the government plans to move back to a tiered approach. There is light at the end of the tunnel. Johnson says there is a shared goal across the UK - to suppress the virus, to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed and to save lives. Boris Johnson is speaking now. He says across the country people are engaged in a \u201chuge joint effort to put the coronavirus back in its box\u201d. These are from Grant Shapps, the transport secretary. Public Health England has published its weekly coronavirus surveillance report (pdf). Here is an extract from its summary. Surveillance indicators suggest that Covid-19 activity at a national level has increased or remained high during week 44 [the week ending 1 November]. There is currently limited testing for other respiratory viruses, however, laboratory indicators suggest that influenza activity is low. Detections of Covid-19 cases in England remained high in week 44. Case detections decreased slightly compared to last week though this is likely to be driven by reduced testing over the half term period as well as a lag in results for the most recent days. Overall positivity rates continued to increase. Incidence and positivity rates remain highest in the north of England though there are some indications that positivity is starting to decline in the north-east and north-west. By age group, cases rates were highest in the 20 to 29 year olds with decreases continuing to be noted in the 10 to 19 year olds. Positivity rates were highest in the 80+ year olds tested through both pillar 1 (NHS and PHE testing) and in the 10 to 19 year olds tested through pillar 2 (community testing). Boris Johnson will be holding a press conference at 5pm. He will be appearing with Sir Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive. Leading theatre producer Nica Burns has praised Rishi Sunak\u2019s extension of the furlough scheme until March as a \u201cmajor step forward\u201d for England\u2019s theatres. Her venues have \u201cbeen given their mojo back\u201d, she said, despite a lockdown that will keep them dark until at least the first week of December. My colleague Chris Wiegand has the full story here. In Northern Ireland, where a month-long lockdown started on 16 October, there have been 516 further coronavirus cases. The details are here. That is 24% down on the total for yesterday (679), 37% down on the total for last Thursday (822), and 50% down on the total for the Thursday two weeks ago (1,042). There have also been 12 further deaths. That is two more than yesterday, and four more than a week ago today. The Office for Statistics Regulation has issued what amounts to a rebuke to the government for not releasing a full explanation of a controversial graph used at the press conference on Saturday, where Boris Johnson announced the English lockdown. The graph showed that, under one worst case scenario produced by modellers, coronavirus deaths would reach 4,000 a day. The chart has been strongly criticised by Tory MPs and newspapers opposed to the lockdown, who argue that by the time the graph was made public the assumptions behind it were already out of date and that its use amounted to scaremongering. In a public letter to Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Ed Humpherson, the head of the OSR, said: Our aim is to uphold public confidence in statistics that serve the public good. During the pandemic there have been high profile public briefings, media interviews and statements in each of the four nations of the UK. These have rightly drawn on data and analysis. We welcome the range of data that has been published and we recognise that those producing the data and advising government face significant pressures. However, the use of data has not always been supported by transparent information being provided in a timely manner. As a result, there is potential to confuse the public and undermine confidence in the statistics. Humpherson said that in future when data is presented in public, the source should be published; that when models are referred to, the \u201cmodel outputs, methodologies and key assumptions\u201d should be published; and that when key decisions are justified by statistics, the statistics should be published. Here is the controversial slide. Earlier this week the government did publish various papers explaining the methodology behind the slides used at the press conference. Public Health Wales has recorded 1,272 more coronavirus cases. Although that is 70 more than the total for yesterday, it is below the total for last Thursday (1,375), which may be a sign the Welsh lockdown is having an impact. But there have been 30 further deaths - up from 21 a week ago today, and seven two weeks ago today. Because people who do die from coronavirus tend to die three to four weeks after infection, the Welsh lockdown, which started on 23 October, was not expected to have an impact on these figures yet. Kate Forbes, the Scottish government\u2019s finance secretary, has welcomed Rishi Sunak\u2019s furlough announcement. She said in a statement. I welcome the chancellor\u2019s positive, but long overdue, announcement that the job retention scheme will be extended until March 2021. We have repeatedly urged the UK government to safeguard jobs by guaranteeing that this support will be available for as long as employers need it ... The upfront guarantee of further consequential payments to cover the rest of the financial year meets another of our long term requests and will enable us to quickly tackle the impacts of the pandemic in Scotland as they arise. This covers consequentials arising from a number of areas including health. Other issues remain to be resolved, including how funding is provided for demand-led business support, where demand is greater than the Barnett share, but I am pleased that the chancellor has today listened to and addressed some of our concerns. NHS England has recorded 236 further coronavirus hospital deaths. There were 100 in the north-west, 49 in the north-east and Yorkshire, 47 in the Midlands, 14 in the south-east, 11 in London, 10 in the east of England, and five in the south-west. The details are here. That is 66 fewer than the total for yesterday (302), but 44 more than the total for this time last week (192). Lives are being put at risk by universities who are insisting that students and lecturers travel to campuses for face-to-face teaching, unions have claimed. While some large institutions have shifted large amounts of work online, pressure was being put on universities in areas such as Nottingham and Lincoln as the government said that all education should remain open during the new lockdown across England. Dozens of students left messages on the Facebook page of the University of Lincoln after it used the site to announce a continuation of face-to-face teaching, with expressing concerns that they were being asked to commute in and out of high risk areas. \u201cSo far this year, every time there is a f2f session, whole groups of us are being contacted by uni track and trace and made to isolate for 14 days. Can you not see that face to face isn\u2019t safe and isn\u2019t working? It needs to stop now,\u201d said one. The University and College Union (UCU) union, which has called with the National Union of Students (NUS) for a move to online activity on campuses, also expressed concern about Nottingham, where Covid infection rates remains high even while the number of infected students on campus has gone down. The University of Nottingham, like Lincoln, has moved to put safety measure in place on campus and said on its website today: \u201cThe University will remain open as now, and continue as planned with current research activities and our blended approach to teaching - in-person where it is safe to do so, and otherwise online.\u201d On its website, the University of Lincoln posted a letter to students from the Universities Minister, Michelle Donelan, in which she said: \u201cBy keeping universities open, we are prioritising education so that there is no gap in your academic journeys and lives.\u201d Rishi Sunak must be getting used to having to rewrite his Covid economic rescue plans, but this was one of the bigger and more significant U-turns he\u2019s yet has to perform. It has multiple consequences. Here are preliminary thoughts on five of them. 1) For the economy This will protect jobs. The CBI has described the move as \u201ca bridge for business to spring 2021\u201d and the TUC has called it a \u201cpositive step\u201d. (See 12.51pm.) Given that almost 20% of firms say they are not confident of surviving the next three months (see 10.33am), that could make a real difference. As Sky\u2019s Sam Coates points out, it will also cushion the economy through the Brexit transition. 2) For devolution The furlough row erupted because the devolved administrations, and the English regions, have been in lockdown cycles out of synch with what is happening in London and the south-east. (See 9.27am.) Sunak has not committed the Treasury to paying furlough in Scotland whenever Nicola Sturgeon needs a lockdown, which would amount to a significant change in the devolution settlement. But he has given the devolved administrations (DAs) assurances, plus a large wodge of money, that should allow them to keep businesses shut at any point they need to until March. The same will apply if parts of England need to stay in tier 3. That is an important win for the DAs and the regions over London. 3) For the public finances Government sources say that furlough will cost more than \u00a35bn in November alone. The full cost to March will depend on the extent to which restrictions are lifted. Covid has already sent government borrowing over \u00a3200bn this year, but this will add to the bill and make it harder for the Treasury to justify the infrastructure spending spree that Boris Johnson was planning when he won the 2019 general election. 4) For Sunak\u2019s reputation - with his party Sunak\u2019s Commons statement was unusual because he spent considerably more time trying to justify his U-turn than he did explaining the new policy. (See 12.38pm.) Although he was right to say governments need to be flexible, it was not particularly plausible claiming that circumstances have just changed, because Sage were calling for a lockdown some weeks ago. Sunak seemed personally aggrieved by the charge of inconsistency, and that may be because his remarkable popularity in the Conservative party (by a large margin he is the most popular cabinet minister among members) is partly explained by two factors. First, he says he\u2019s a fiscal conservative. \u201cThis Conservative government will always balance the books,\u201d he told the party conference. And, second, he\u2019s relatively lockdown-sceptic. \u201cOur lives can no longer be put on hold,\u201d he told MPs in September, when he announced his winter economy plan. \u201cWe must learn to live with it and live without fear.\u201d Both these positions are very popular with Conservative party members (although not necessarily with the public at large). But, after today, it is harder for Sunak to present himself in these terms. 5) For Sunak\u2019s reputation - more generally In many respects it\u2019s a day of humiliation for the chancellor. Just look at the reaction from the commentariat. From Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies From the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh U-turns are never comfortable for a politician. But, although damaging reputationally, they are often beneficial in the long run because they eliminate a problem damaging the government. Sunak has achieved this today. As the former government economist Simon French points out, at least now Sunak is ahead of the curve. The UK\u2019s largest education union has reacted with fury after education secretary Gavin Williamson accused its leaders of failing to put the education of children first by calling for schools to close during lockdown. As schools in England opened for the first day of the new restrictions, Williamson wrote a column in the Telegraph, accusing the National Education Union (NEU) of putting pupils\u2019 progress in jeopardy. The NEU has been campaigning for schools and colleges to be included in the national lockdown in England amid evidence of a 50-fold increase in Covid infections in secondary schools since September. Williamson accused the NEU leadership of being content to put children\u2019s progress on hold. He said: When the risks are being managed, when the benefits of being in school are so clear, this seems to be an isolated position that doesn\u2019t put the best interests of pupils first. Mary Bousted, NEU joint general secretary, said teachers had responded with \u201cincredulity\u201d to Williamson\u2019s claim in the column that when it comes to children \u201cthere really is nothing we wouldn\u2019t do to make sure they get the education they deserve\u201d. She cited his failure on free school meals, laptops and additional funding for Covid safety measures in schools. She said: What we see, time and time again from Gavin Williamson is poor propaganda unmatched by the decisive action that is needed to support pupils\u2019 continuing access to education. Far from there being nothing he wouldn\u2019t do, the reality is that he is doing very little to keep schools open safely and to support children and young people with practical ways so that they can keep learning during this pandemic. From Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank The Welsh economy minister, Ken Skates, has said businesses in Wales will have a \u201ccaptive market\u201d when they reopen on Monday following a 17-day \u201cfirebreak\u201d lockdown. Skates said the four-week English lockdown for non-essential shops would give Welsh businesses an advantage. Speaking at the Welsh government\u2019s press conference, Skates said: Those [Welsh] businesses will have a very captive audience. People in Wales will not be able to access non-essential retail across the border in Chester or Oswestry. Hospitality businesses, non-essential retail in Wales will have a captive market and that is something they surely will be able to celebrate for four weeks during which their equivalents in England are in lockdown. However, Skates said co-ordinated lockdowns across the UK would have been desirable. \u201cWe were pushing for a concerted UK-wide programme of restrictions but we couldn\u2019t wait on the UK government any longer.\u201d He said that if further restrictions were needed in the future, the Welsh government would prefer a four nations approach. He said he thought a UK-wide approach would be agreed. At first minister\u2019s questions, which began as Rishi Sunak was making his furlough statement, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed a further 1,216 new cases of coronavirus in Scotland and 39 deaths, adding that the latest estimate of the country\u2019s R number was likely to show it \u201chovering around 1\u201d. She said this was thanks to tough measures taken earlier in the autumn, as well as public compliance starting to have an effect on the infection rate. Noting that the new English lockdown measures begin today, Sturgeon repeated that she \u201ccan\u2019t rule out a full lockdown\u201d in Scotland \u201cbut right now we are in a better position\u201d. She also cautioned that next week\u2019s review of Scotland\u2019s five-level system of Covid control would be \u201ctaking a very cautious and precautionary stance\u201d. Because the furlough statement was happening simultaneously, it was only raised briefly by the Scottish Greens\u2019 health spokesperson, Alison Johnstone. Sturgeon said she hadn\u2019t seen the detail of the UK chancellor\u2019s statement yet, but that the \u201cacid test\u201d for it would be whether somebody on 80% furlough now, regardless of whether they live in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, will continue to be on 80% once England comes out of full lockdown. Sturgeon said it was \u201cdeeply regrettable\u201d that businesses had made people redundant or gone into liquidation because they expected the scheme to end at the end of October. \u201cWe should have had the ongoing reassurance of furlough at 80% all along.\u201d Back in the Commons David Linden (SNP) asks Rishi Sunak why the furlough scheme is being extended to March, but support for the self-employed is only being extended until January, according to the statement. (See 12.24pm.) Sunak says that the self-employed employment support scheme would be extended until March, but the Treasury had not decided yet how much it would be worth during that phase. These are from my colleague Heather Stewart. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross was quick to claim his part in the U-turn, after Rishi Sunak confirmed that the furlough extension would be available to devolved nations, describing this as \u201ca demonstration of the strength of the union\u201d. Ross said: Scottish Conservative pressure has delivered. All week, we\u2019ve made the case that Scottish jobs had to be protected at all costs. We\u2019ve worked constructively with the UK government and pushed them for answers where necessary. Ross praised Sunak, saying he had \u201cblown the SNP\u2019s grievances out of the water with an extra billion pounds for Scotland, and shown again that the UK government will do whatever it takes to support jobs throughout this pandemic.\u201d Back in the Commons Peter Bone (Con) asks Rishi Sunak how the government will pay for this. In the short term, says Sunak, through \u201cextensive borrowing\u201d. He says the debt to GDP ratio will reach 100% this year. But that is not sustainable, he says. He says the government will have to \u201creduce our structural deficit over time\u201d. In the short term that will come through growth, he says. But he says that the public finances will also have to be \u201cbalanced appropriately\u201d. As the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley points out, the Treasury briefing (pdf) says that workers who were made redundant in advance of the planned end of the furlough scheme on 31 October can be rehired under the furlough extension. From the FT\u2019s George Parker And here is a five-page Treasury briefing (pdf) with more details of the furlough announcement. Here is the Treasury\u2019s new release about today\u2019s announcement. In the Commons Christine Jardine, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson, has said the furlough scheme should be extended until the summer. Sunak said that there would be a review in January, and that today\u2019s statement covered the medium term. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, has given a partial welcome the the chancellor\u2019s announcement. In a statement she said: Agreeing to extend the job retention scheme at 80% until the spring, as unions have called for, is a positive step. But there are still gaps in the government\u2019s support package. It\u2019s not right to ask millions of low-paid workers on furlough to survive on less than the minimum wage. The Chancellor must fix the scheme so their pay is topped up to 100%. And he must offer to help to those self-employed workers who are falling between the cracks. We also need an urgent boost to both sick pay and universal credit. No-one should be plunged into financial hardship if they have to self-isolate or if they lose their job. Boris Johnson is holding a press conference with Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, at 5pm, No 10 has announced. Margaret Greenwood (Lab) asks why the government only made job support more generous when people in the south of England were affected. Sunak says the government treats everyone the same. He says it is \u201csimply wrong\u201d to claim that people in the north were treated less generously. Alison Thewliss, the SNP\u2019s Treasury spokesperson, says she has been calling for these measures for months. She says the Treasury only responded when England was under threat. Can Sunak confirm that furlough will be maintained at 80%, and not tied to any sector? There is nothing for the self-employed, she says. Sunak says Scotland will receive an extra \u00a31bn in upfront funding. It will be for the Scottish government to decide how it uses that, he says. He says the Scottish government has the power to raise taxes. If it considers these measures important, it could raise funds for them, he suggests. Mel Stride, the Tory chair of the Commons Treasury committee, asks if the Treasury will publish its analysis of the economic impact of lockdown. Sunak says there is not a specific report on this. But the Treasury has looked at the economic impact, he says. From the Independent\u2019s Ben Chu Sunak is responding to Dodds. He says the claim that the government acted late is a \u201cmisapprehension\u201d, in the words of government health advisers. He says there is no perfect time for these measures. He says Labour\u2019s plan was never clear. At first it was a two week lockdown, then it was a three-week one, and then it involved repeat lockdowns. He says Labour has not put forward its own six-month plan. That is because they know that we are dealing with a once-in-a-century event, he says. The government must be \u201cflexible\u201d. In the face of such an unprecedented crisis, the government must be flexible to ever-changing circumstances. It is not a weakness to be agile and fast-moving in the face of a crisis, but rather a strength and that will not change. Dodds says the government will not accept that, until it deals with the health crisis, it won\u2019t be able to deal with the economic crisis. Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, is responding to Sunak. She says Labour asked for a short lockdown weeks ago. Sunak implied in his statement the government was only warned about the need for a lockdown last week. But in fact Sage advised the government this was needed in September, she says. She says the country needs a chancellor ahead of circumstances - not behind them. She says the Welsh government asked for measures that would support their lockdown. The chancellor said no. Scotland asked for a promise that the Treasury would fund further lockdowns. Sunak said no. But the PM said yes, requiring Sunak to back down, Dodds says. Sunak says the government thought it would be able to stay ahead of the virus. Over the summer it came up with policies to support an economy that would remain open. The plan had wide-ranging support, he says. The CBI and the TUC were in favour. But the virus continued to spread. The government intensified its business support programme in response. But the government then had to tighten restrictions. That affected businesses. As a result the job support scheme was beefed up. The virus continued to spread, he says. Last week ministers were warned the NHS might be overwhelmed within weeks. To protect the NHS, new temporary restrictions were necessary. Sunak says that is why he decided to extend the furlough scheme, rather than move to the new job support scheme (the less version intended to replace it). He says he has been criticised for this. But it is best to respond to evolving circumstances, he says. He says he will leave it to others to decide if it was right to alter economic policy as circumstances changed. But he knows that he is supporting business, he says. Sunak confirms that the employment support scheme for the self-employed is being made more generous. For self-employed people, I can confirm the next income support grant which covers the period November to January will now increase to 80% of average profits up to \u00a37,500. And he says he can assured the devolved administrations that the furlough scheme will be available for them until March. I also want to reassure the people of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The furlough scheme was designed and delivered by the government of the United Kingdom on behalf of all the people of the United Kingdom, wherever they live. That has been the case since March, it is the case now and will remain the case until next March. It is a demonstration of the strength of the union and an undeniable truth of this crisis we have only been able to provide this level of economic support because we are a United Kingdom. And I can announce today that the upfront guaranteed funding for devolved administrations is increasing from \u00a314bn to \u00a316bn. This Treasury is, has been and will always be the Treasury for the whole of the United Kingdom. Sunak says the government\u2019s highest priority is to protect jobs and livelihoods. He says he has announced furlough for November. But people want to know what comes next. As we learnt during the first lockdown, recovery can take longer, he says. And he says the Bank of England said this morning the recovery was slowed. Sunak says the furlough scheme will be extended until the end of March. It will be reviewed in January to see whether employers should contribute more, he says. UPDATE: Here is the key quote. We can announce today that the furlough scheme will not be extended for one month, it will be extended until the end of March. The government will continue to help pay people\u2019s wages up to 80% of the normal amount. All employers will have to pay for hours not worked is the cost of employer NICs and pension contributions. We will review the policy in January to decide whether economic circumstances are improving enough to ask employers to contribute more. Sunak says the government has also spent \u00a3200bn on Covid measures. Today\u2019s announcement follows the one from the Bank of England this morning, he says. There is a summary here. Rishi Sunak starts by summing up some of the job and business measures already introduced. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is about to give his Commons statement about the future of furlough. From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates In response to an urgent question in the Commons earlier Matt Hancock, the health secretary, clarified that people are allowed to leave their homes to travel abroad for assisted dying purposes during the new English lockdown. He told MPs: The new coronavirus regulations which come into force today place restrictions on leaving the home without a reasonable excuse. Travelling abroad for the purpose of assisted dying is a reasonable excuse and so anyone doing so would not be breaking the law. Hancock also said that although, under the current law, encouraging or assisting the death of another person is illegal, \u201cit is legal to travel abroad for the purpose of assisted dying where it is allowed in that jurisdiction.\u201d At the weekend the Sunday Times published a moving account (paywall) from a woman who was bringing forward plans to visit the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland to end her life because she thought the lockdown might prevent her. The Department of Health and Social Care has published the latest weekly performance data (pdf) for NHS Test and Trace. Its performance has been widely criticised because it has consistently failed to meet key targets, but on some metrics this week there have been notable improvements. In-person test results are being delivered more quickly. The service is still a long way off delivering all results within 24 hours, as Boris Johnson promised, but in the last week the waiting times have come down. The report says: Between 22 October and 28 October, the median time taken to receive a test result for regional test sites decreased to 31 hours from 39 hours in the previous week. Similarly, the median time decreased for local test sites to 33 hours from 40 hours and for mobile testing units to 29 hours from 33 hours during the same period. There has been a sharp increase in the last week in the number of people testing positive who are contacted within 24 hours. The report says: Between 22 October and 28 October, 67.0% of people (75,446) were reached within 24 hours. The proportion of people reached within 24 hours has been declining since mid September but has notably increased in the latest week from 43.6% in the week before. Since test and trace launched on 28 May, 58.9% of people (285,461) have been reached within 24 hours. This chart illustrates the figures. It is worth stressing, of course, that this is still far from perfect. Ideally test and trace would be contacting people testing positive, getting details of their close contacts, and then telling them to self-isolate all within 24 hours. But the report says only 41% of close contacts who are reached and told to self-isolate get this message within 24 hours of the case entering the system. And there has also been an increase in the proportion of close contacts who are being reached and asked to self-isolate within 24 hours. The report says: Between 22 October and 28 October, 75.4% of contacts who weren\u2019t managed by local HPTs [health protection teams - they only deal with a small proportion of cases] were reached and advised to self-isolate within 24 hours of being identified. This proportion has notably decreased since mid-September. [However it] has increased over the past 3 weeks. Overall, since Test and Trace launched, 70.6% of these contacts have been reached and advised to self-isolate within 24 hours. Here is the chart that illustrates this. And here are the figures showing the proportion of close contacts being reached within 24 hours going up from 64.6% to 75.4%. But not all the figures are positive. The service is supposed to reach 80% of the close contacts of people who have tested positive, but it has persistently been missing this target and the latest figures show just 59.9% of contacts reached in the week ending 28 October. This is down from 60.6% last week, and represents a new low. Tom Bower\u2019s new biography of Boris Johnson has had some rather poor reviews but it has at least prompted Rory Stewart, the former Conservative cabinet minister and a leadership candidate in the contest that Johnson won, to write a superb and blistering essay about his former ministerial colleague. Here\u2019s an excerpt on Johnson\u2019s mastery of dishonest, but do read the whole thing in the Times Literary Supplement. Johnson is after all the most accomplished liar in public life \u2013 perhaps the best liar ever to serve as prime minister. Some of this may have been a natural talent \u2013 but a lifetime of practice and study has allowed him to uncover new possibilities which go well beyond all the classifications of dishonesty attempted by classical theorists like St Augustine. He has mastered the use of error, omission, exaggeration, diminution, equivocation and flat denial. He has perfected casuistry, circumlocution, false equivalence and false analogy. He is equally adept at the ironic jest, the fib and the grand lie; the weasel word and the half-truth; the hyperbolic lie, the obvious lie, and the bullshit lie \u2013 which may inadvertently be true. And because he has been so famous for this skill for so long, he can use his reputation to ascend to new levels of playful paradox. Thus he could say to me \u201cRory, don\u2019t believe anything I am about to say, but I would like you to be in my cabinet\u201d \u2013 and still have me laugh in admiration. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster and the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, told the Today programme this morning that he expected the government to ease its ban on collective worship during the lockdown in England. He said: I think it will be changed. I think the evidence we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of days is that this particular aspect of the decision by the government is not supported by any scientific evidence and clearly shows a misunderstanding of the importance of religious faith. I think those things will lead to change. As soon as possible, I hope to see places of worship opened again [for services]. In the Commons yesterday Matt Hancock, the health secretary, hinted that the rules could be changed soon. In the Commons Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, has been taking questions. Asked by his Labour opposite number Jo Stevens when live performances would be allowed to return, he said he could not give a date. He said: Once we\u2019re through this lockdown period I very much hope that socially distanced performances will be able to return ... At the moment I hope she\u2019ll appreciate, given the wider context, it\u2019s very difficult to give an accurate date - as soon as we can I want to be able to do that. But Dowden confirmed rehearsals for productions \u201ccan continue behind closed doors\u201d during the new lockdown. The Office for National Statistics has published one of its regular reports on the impact of coronavirus on business. It says a third of firms in the hotel or food sector have little or no confidence that they will survive for the next three months. Here is the chart with the figures for all sectors of the economy. According to the full data, in the accommodation and food services sector, 22.9% of businesses have low confidence that they will survive the next three months and 8.6% have no confidence. Surprisingly, the equivalent figures for firms in arts, entertainment and leisure are not so bad. Only 4.6% said they had low confidence that they would survive the next three months, and 4% said they had no confidence. But 34.9% of them said they were not sure. No other sector of the economy recorded anything like this level of uncertainty. In accommodation and food, only 2.1% of firms said they were not sure if they would survive the next three months. Overall, amongst all sectors, 43.6% of firm have high confidence they will survive the next three months and 38% have moderate confidence. But almost one in five are not confident - saying either they have low confidence (8.9%) or no confidence (2.3%), or they\u2019re not sure (7.3%). The second national lockdown in England has been caused in part by a lack of public compliance, Robert Buckland, the justice secretary has claimed, saying it will be a \u201chuge challenge\u201d to get the public to follow the strict rules the second time around. My colleague Jessica Elgot has the story. The number of coronavirus cases in London was slightly falling in the final week of October, compared to the previous week, according to the latest figures from the mayor\u2019s office. This is from Sadiq Khan. And here\u2019s an extract. In the most recent week of complete data, 24 October 2020 - 30 October 2020, 13,103 people tested positive in London, a rate of 146 cases per 100,000 population. This compares with 13,650 cases and a rate of 152 for the previous week. For England as a whole there were 229 cases per 100,000 population for the week ending 30 October 2020. \u201cI really do not know how to exhaust my affirmative vocabulary any further,\u201d Boris Johnson told an SNP MP in the Commons yesterday, as he was asked for the umpteenth time if the government would agree to fund a furlough scheme beyond November, if Scotland needed a lockdown but England didn\u2019t. \u201cThey won\u2019t take yes for an answer.\u201d This issue has been bubbling for three days now and this afternoon in the Commons we should finally get a resolution. It might sound technical - Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, will explain how furlough policy might operate going into the new year - but it\u2019s about how power and spending is distributed around the UK, and about the extent to which devolution will allow lockdown policies to vary. Tl:dr - London seems to be giving up a bit more control. Health policy is devolved, but furlough policy is decided by Westminster, and Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have complained that this means they cannot order their own lockdowns if the Treasury won\u2019t pay to help the firms that have to close. In the last month or so the issue has become acute because the three devolved administrations have started their own firebreak lockdowns well ahead of England. English regions do not control their own health policy, but the areas placed under the strictest tier 3 conditions were complaining that workers were only getting 67% of their normal salary under the Treasury support, not the 80% that applied under the original furlough. But, magically, as soon as the government decided the whole of England would have to go into lockdown (ie, the south, and not just parts of the north), the money became available for an 80% scheme. This week the government has been under pressure to agree that, if devolved administrations want to hold their own lockdowns after November, or if strict regional lockdowns continue in England, the 80% furlough will remain available. On Monday all we got was a vague promise that the UK government would be supportive. By yesterday Johnson was sounding more specific and today we will get the full announcement. Here is my colleague Richard Partington\u2019s preview of what we are expecting. And here is the key extract. The chancellor was preparing to announce that the flagship wage subsidy scheme \u2013 which pays 80% of workers\u2019 wages \u2013 would continue to be made available for parts of the UK under the highest levels of Covid restrictions, sources said, in a significant climbdown for the government. But will this be enough? And what will happen if, say, Scotland wants a four-week lockdown, but the Treasury thinks it is unnecessary and refuses to pay. Here are some of the comments we\u2019ve had ahead of the announcement. From Carolyn Fairbairn, outgoing director general of the CBI From Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary Working families need financial security to get through the times tough ahead. And employers need an end to last-minute decisions. The chancellor must extend the furlough scheme and support for the self-employed into the spring. From Kate Forbes, the Scottish government\u2019s finance secretary Despite repeated calls this week for full details of the prime minister\u2019s commitment to a Scotland-only furlough and SEISS [self-employed income support] scheme, we are still no further forward and remain in the dark about what these schemes will look like ... I hope that today\u2019s statement will at last give us the clarity we require. From Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester We\u2019ll find out later. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The ONS publishes data on the economic impact of coronavirus. 10am: Sir Tom Scholar, permanent secretary at the Treasury, and other officials give evidence to the Commons public accounts committee about the Bounce Back loan scheme. 10.30am: A health minister answers a Commons urgent question on how the lockdown affects the ability of people to travel abroad for an assisted death. 11am: Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, speaks about Welsh living standards at Resolution Foundation event. 11am: NHS Test and Trace publishes its weekly performance figures. Around 12pm: Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, makes a statement to MPs about the furlough scheme. 12.15pm: Ken Skates, the Welsh economy minister, gives a coronavirus briefing. 12.20pm: Nicola Sturgeon takes first minister\u2019s questions in the Scottish parliament. Politics Live is now doubling up as the UK coronavirus live blog and, given the way the Covid crisis eclipses everything, this will continue for the foreseeable future. But we will be covering non-Covid political stories too, and when they seem more important or more interesting, they will take precedence. Here is our global coronavirus live blog. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
