It is not as if India have a lamentable record here in Kolkata in recent times. There is a pattern to recent matches at Eden Gardens, which does not bode so well for England. In November 2011 Dhoni (144 runs to his name) declared on 631 for seven and India won by an innings against West Indies; in February 2010 Dhoni's declaration (when he was 132 not out) came on 643 for six against South Africa, the precursor to another innings victory. In November 2007 Dhoni was there (50 not out) when Anil Kumble declared on 616 for five, although this match against Pakistan ended in a draw. It is hard to pin down Dhoni. It may be in his pursuit of fast-turning tracks that he is a motivated by an Olympian zeal to ensure that Test cricket in the 21st century is an enthralling spectacle. That was certainly the case in Mumbai last week. There is also sound cricketing logic in his eagerness to take the toss out of the equation by having the ball turning from the start. Dhoni may also want pitches that favour his team and, despite Mumbai, that means plenty of encouragement for the spinners. There is not much wrong with that either. The most cynical view of Dhoni's outspoken demands is that he is seeking a short-cut to victory. India's cricketers, like England's, have little respite in their schedules. A certain laziness, a reluctance to do all the hard yards in the field on a docile track could also spark his yearning to make sure that the game keeps moving quickly. Whatever Dhoni's motivation, if his requests are met we will have a far more exciting series on our hands than so many in the past. The tour of 1981-82 was one nadir. Graham Gooch was recalling the other day how, after India had won the first Test of that series, the rest of the pitches were as flat and unyielding as marble; the over rate was about 10 per hour and when Geoff Boycott and Chris Tavar\u00e9 dug in together, John Emburey declared [expletives depleted]: \"I cannot watch this any more; I'm going back to the hotel\" \u2013 even though he was playing in the game. This week there has been much speculation about the pitch in Kolkata with the suggestion that the Board of Control for Cricket in India's man has been shipped in to ensure that the 83-year-old groundsman at Eden Gardens, Prabir Mukherjee, delivers for Dhoni. Mukherjee, a proud man, has called the demand for instant turners \"immoral\" given that tickets are sold for five days. He requested written instructions from the BCCI to protect his reputation and at one point threatened to take no further part in the preparation of the pitch. He later relented. His assistant said that at least three pitches were available; one of them has clearly been used recently. Normally batsmen prevail for the first half of the match, bowlers in the second. India tend to play two pacemen here. It is winter; it is dark by five o'clock and the start of play is at nine, when there can be some help for the seamers. Despite England's triumph in Mumbai, Alastair Cook's side are likely to have more changes than Dhoni's (India will probably swap Harbhajan Singh, who may be stuck on 99 Tests for a while, for Ishant Sharma). Ian Bell is here again and the happy father has not flown all the way back to carry the drinks. The assumption is that he will come back into the team in place of Jonny Bairstow. As one senior returns, another may be dropped. Stuart Broad is the vice-captain but that does not guarantee a place. Nor should it. This is not shaping up to be a series for faint hearts. So there is much to be said for gambling on Steven Finn as Jimmy Anderson's accomplice rather than persevering with Broad, who was so innocuous in Mumbai. The management will have to be convinced that Finn is 100% fit. That is a far more legitimate concern than fretting too much about England's ever-lengthening tail. In any case Broad has been unable to make a contribution with the bat in this series. Even so, it is not ideal to have Anderson strolling out to bat at No9. There is little point in agonising too long over whether England should play two specialist spinners. Monty Panesar has to be in the team but, for his sake, a word of caution may be appropriate. In Mumbai the ball turned and bounced sharply and, as Dhoni was quick to point out, Panesar with his extra pace was the most effective of all the spinners. However, the Kolkata pitch is more likely to mirror the one in Ahmedabad. It may not suit Panesar quite as well. On a more positive note that nasty little statistic about England's lack of success when playing Panesar and Swann in the team can now be banished. Indeed, after Panesar's 11 wickets it was easy to forget how well Swann had bowled \u2013 which has not always been the case when this pair have been in tandem. As for India there are some delicious conundrums. Dhoni and Sachin Tendulkar are masters at disguising any nervousness that they may feel but they are under even more intense scrutiny than usual. Tendulkar, in particular, has rarely been under so much pressure to deliver. Down in Perth they know that they are catching a final glimpse of Ricky Ponting. Here in Kolkata we will all be watching very carefully \u2013 just in case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
