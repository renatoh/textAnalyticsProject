Drones review \u2013 the threat is terrifyingly real", "bodyText": "There is a programme on the Discovery Channel called MythBusters whose presenters and producers, I have long thought, must be among the happiest people on Earth. Their raison d\u2019\u00eatre is taking things people reckon are true and examining whether they are. Can a handgun held incorrectly \u2013 MythBusters is an American production \u2013 really blow off a man\u2019s thumb? Let\u2019s construct man\u2011hands out of chicken parts and wire and see \u2026 Boom! Yes, it can! Can gaffer tape be used to mend a boat leak? Well, not only can it fix a leak, my friends, but you can construct an entire boat out of the stuff and put it successfully to sea. When testing whether a stick of dynamite tossed in a cement mixer is the best way to get rid of the layer of building-glue therein, why not set off 390kg (850lb) of military-grade explosives inside a 15-metre-thick layer of concrete, too? Again, in slow motion, for the cheap seats! For a flagship science documentary series, Horizon\u2019s latest instalment \u2013 Britain\u2019s Next Air Disaster? Drones (BBC Two) \u2013 hath drunk surprisingly deeply from the MythBusters well. The presenter, Aldo Kane (a former Royal Marines commando and sniper, now an all-round action man and high-risk adviser to the kinds of people and companies who need to be advised on high-risk things \u2013 and sporter of a beard so vigorous it should have had separate billing), has all kinds of fun. He gets to see gelatine packages (mimicking birds) fired into aeroplane wings; smash up a drone \u2013 or \u201cunmanned aerial vehicle\u201d (UAV), if you are so minded \u2013 and fire its parts at another one; shoot a rifle all over the Lake District; and get to grips with something called Leonardo\u2019s Falcon Shield, a name that shall be writ on a lake of testosterone and fire by a pen made of testicles. This is all to investigate how much danger this new technology poses, in the wake of Gatwick\u2019s three-day drone incident, during which 140,000 passengers on 1,000 diverted or cancelled flights were royally spragged after reports of the unmanned little buggers being seen near runways. What can we do about the people who would rather use these ever faster, ever cheaper devices not for delivering urgent medical supplies, going into disaster areas too unsafe for people to enter, dropping off new hardbacks and kitchen appliances at people\u2019s homes or otherwise adding to the sum of human happiness and progress, but for frustrating the pursuit of the peace and safety in which we had once hoped to live? Kane does his due diligence, duly and diligently. Drone pilots show him how far, fast and accurately a UAV can be sent anywhere, while experts testify that it can be done by operators hidden 1,000 miles away. The sharp metal drone parts he smashes up and fires off do far more damage to a plane than bird mush does \u2013 and there were 125 near-misses in 2018. Drone manufacturers\u2019 pledges to install new collision warnings won\u2019t \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 stop the drone operators for whom colliding with planes is the whole point. Ditto planned legislation for users of drones weighing more than 250g to be registered with the Civil Aviation Authority. Meanwhile, we watch footage from August 2018 of an attempted assassination by drone of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the embattled Venezuelan president, which shows how easily geofencing \u2013 which is used to keep drones operating within a certain perimeter \u2013 can be hacked, and why shooting tiny things out of busy skies with bullets that can still kill people on their way down is sub-optimal. For all the boys-with-toys overlay, the programme\u2019s underlying message is sober and devoid of histrionics. The problem is that it all adds up to less than the sum of its parts. Yes, there is this threat and that threat, and these possibilities, and these loopholes in current defences against them. But despite Kane\u2019s assertions that various things are \u201cterrifying\u201d, there is too much distance between the evidence and the threat to induce much emotion. Whether this is the fault of the show or the fact that most of us are maxed-out, terror-wise, by clearer and more present dangers to factor in a new one is hard to say. Personally, I am at a point where worrying about drone strikes feels like a luxury my mental health can\u2019t afford. But it is on my list now. As soon as a space opens up, I will start. Thank you, Aldo; thank you, Horizon \u2013 I think."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
