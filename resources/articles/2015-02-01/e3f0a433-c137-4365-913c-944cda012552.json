In a leader column, first published online on Thursday evening, it criticises the BBC \u2013 which along with the Guardian first revealed how HSBC helped clients with Swiss accounts to avoid tax \u2013 for being subsidised by taxpayers, and the Guardian for being \u201ccushioned from commercial reality by a generously-endowed charitable trust\u201d. \u201cFor the avoidance of any doubt, we have no regard for the opinions of rival media organisations. None is the paragon of moral or journalistic virtue that their criticisms this week might suggest. All have their own self-serving agendas, both political and commercial. We will take no lectures about journalism from the likes of the BBC, the Guardian or the Times.\u201d Peter Oborne, who had been chief political commentator of the newspaper, resigned this week in protest at its coverage of the HSBC scandal. He claimed that the paper soft-pedalled on HSBC because of commercial pressures. He has called for an independent inquiry into the newspaper\u2019s editorial guidelines. The Telegraph defended its coverage of HSBC and attacks rival outlets for covering the latest allegations with \u201calmost indecent glee\u201d. It adds: \u201cWe believe we are not alone in our suspicion that those outlets have given this issue such prominence partly because of their deep-seated hostility to business and partly with the intention of doing political harm to the current government and the Conservative Party in particular.\u201d The article goes on to say that the Telegraph is \u201cdrawing up guidelines that will define clearly and openly how our editorial and commercial staff will co-operate in an increasingly competitive media industry\u201d. \u201cNo subject, no story, no person and no organisation is off-limits to our journalists. We care profoundly about our readers. There is indeed a bond of trust between a newspaper such as The Daily Telegraph and its readers. We take that bond very seriously indeed.\u201d The leader concludes: \u201cWe are proud to do that which our critics cannot or will not do: to combine journalistic excellence with commercial success. We do so for you, our readers. We will continue to do so.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
