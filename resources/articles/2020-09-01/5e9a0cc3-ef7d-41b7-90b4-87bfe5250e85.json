Thanks for your company and musical tips - goodnight! \u201cIt is telling that for Jota\u2019s goal, the only player who appealed for handball was Guendouzi who was standing behind him and off to the side,\u201d says Graeme Thorn. \u201cNone of the four Arsenal defenders between him and the goal, with a much better view, bothered to complain. Plus the referee was in an excellent position (closer than most of the Arsenal defenders) to see if it did brush the arm.\u201d Watch the replay - it\u2019s clear. It hits his thigh, his arm and then his right foot. I loathe VAR. I\u2019ve seen a replay of Jota\u2019s goal and it was a clear handball. It hit his thigh and then his arm before he volleyed it in. I doubt it changed the result but, really, what\u2019s the point? Peep peep! Liverpool move above Everton and up to second after a hard-fought but thoroughly deserved win over a determined Arsenal. At times Liverpool were scintillating, and Arsenal did really well to stay in the game. Alisson had to make a fine save from Alexandre Lacazette before the substitute Diogo Jota settled the match with a goal on his Premier League debut for Liverpool. They\u2019re an awesome team, and they\u2019re going to win the league by a country mile again. 90+1 min Takumi Minamino replaces Roberto Firmino. There will be three minutes of added time. GOAL GIVEN! Alexander-Arnold\u2019s cross was headed away by Luiz to the edge of the area, where Jota controlled it with his thigh - and a bit of a his arm, I thought - before dragging a volley into the corner. But VAR decided it was fine and the goal stands. I\u2019d need to see another replay to be sure but I thought that brushed his bicep. I doubt it has changed the result. I think this will be disallowed for handball. Diogo Jota scores within 10 minutes of coming on for his Liverpool league debut! 86 min Salah and Wijnaldum combine to give Jota another clear chance, only for him to be brilliantly tackled by ... Salah. He tried to take the ball off Jota on the stretch and miscontrolled it. That was definitely Jota\u2019s chance. 85 min Another Arsenal corner, another underhit travesty from Pepe. 84 min \u201cWriting from a forlorn fire escape in Brooklyn,\u201d writes Christian Svanes Kolding. \u201cAye, I can confirm that the sparsely-flavoured swill known as Newcastle Brown Ale still has cachet over here in the States. I see the kids drinking it and for Gen X\u2019ers like me, there was a time when it was deemed exotic. A more adventurous choice than Heineken. Today, Heineken has been replaced by Peroni. The humanity.\u201d 83 min: Jota misses a great chance to score a debut goal! Salah put him through with a stunning angled pass that took five Arsenal players out of the game. Jota swept the ball over the outrushing Leno but into the side netting. 82 min Jota runs at Holding, moves infield onto his right foot and sprays a shot well wide from the edge of the area. 81 min \u201cIt\u2019s heartening to see Arsenal players doing anything to put themselves in front of the ball,\u201d says Jennifer Williams. \u201cPrevious teams would let the Reds stroll right on through the box. Happy to see some grit.\u201d They have improved so much under Arteta; I don\u2019t think this is a false dawn. 80 min Mane wasn\u2019t thrilled to be taken off. Jurgen Klopp had a quick chat with him and all seems okay. 79 min A double Liverpool change. Diogo Jota comes on for his Liverpool Premier League debut in place of Sadio Mane, and James Milner replaces Naby Keita. 78 min Arsenal win a rare corner, but it\u2019s a poor one from Pepe and Robertson clears at the near post. 76 min Ceballos plays a through ball to Nketiah, who is just beaten to the ball by Alisson on the edge of the area. I think he would have been offside. Liverpool go down the other end and Firmino\u2019s shot spins just wide off Tierney. 74 min Arsenal\u2019s final substitution. Lacazette, who scored one and should have scored another, is replaced by Eddie Nketiah. 73 min \u201cIt\u2019s anyone BUT hipsters swilling Dog (Broon Ale) in the North East,\u201d says Mike Ollier. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time since it was a good beer, now brewed elsewhere and the recipe has changed a few times. Not only is it NOT brewed in Newcastle, it isn\u2019t even brewed in the UK. A far superior Brown Ale is Sunderland\u2019s Double Maxim and Sammy Smiths Brewery Brown.\u201d 72 min Ceballos is booked for bumping Mane to the floor. 72 min Plenty of recent Arsenal teams would be 4-1 or 5-1 down tonight. They\u2019ve done ever so well to stay in the game because Liverpool have been relentless. 71 min \u201cDarren Fletcher was very good on Match of the Day 2 last night demonstrating how Bielsaball begins with his overload of defenders (opposition attackers plus one),\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cI\u2019d suggest leaving three players up against Liverpool as often as possible, pinning one full back and then judicious use of the benign block (aka tactical foul) on the other side - players usually get two or three before the yellow card. \u201cNot perfect of course, but if the average position of the full-backs is ten yards further back, surely that would reduce their threat significantly over 95 minutes. Whether it\u2019s worth the understaffed midfield is moot, but these full-backs win so many matches any answer to them has to be radical.\u201d I like that idea, but I\u2019m not sure you would pin a full-back - wouldn\u2019t they just drop Fabinho in? It\u2019ll be interested, especially after yesterday, to see what Brendan Rodgers does when Leicester next play Liverpool. 70 min Marvellous persistence from Mane, who fights his way past Bellerin and Ceballos before whipping a shot from a tight angle that is comfortable saved by Leno. 68 min Bellerin is booked for a foul on Mane. And Willian is replaced by Nicolas Pepe. 68 min Aubameyang tries to run Fabinho, who blocks his run and is lucky not to be penalised. 66 min Arsenal are still in this game, just about. The next goal is a big goal. I thank you. 64 min Mane, on the turn, shovels a loose ball just wide after Firmino\u2019s pass deflected into his path. It was a difficult chance because he had to do a 180-degree spin just to get a shot anywhere near goal. 63 min: Big save from Alisson! Lacazette goes through on goal again after a crafty pass from Ceballos. He looked onside this time and he was, but Alisson came out quickly and stood tall to block his shot. Lacazette should have done better. 62 min Van Dijk strides forward and has a pop from 25 yards. It\u2019s well struck and Leno shovels it away as he falls to his left. 61 min Salah\u2019s slightly selfish shot from a tight angle is blocked by Tierney. 61 min \u201cThinking of hipster beers, and so on, back in my undergrad days at UCL, Newcastle Brown Ale was the cheap beer of choice,\u201d says Sarah Rothwell. \u201cNowadays, here in Denver, you see it sold as a cool hipster beverage. Amazing what a few decades and a change of accent can do for a drink.\u201d That\u2019s absurd. I had no idea it had become a hipster beer. What next: Hofmeister New England IPA? 60 min An Arsenal substitution. Dani Ceballos replaces Granit Xhaka, who has worked like a beast without the ball. And he wasn\u2019t booked. 59 min Alisson denies Lacazette in a one-on-one, though everyone knew he was going to be flagged offside after the event, and he was. 58 min Willian stays down for a bit after a crunching challenge from Fabinho. He\u2019s fine now. 57 min \u201cThe match is on Peacock over here, a channel we can finally stream,\u201d says Lorraine Berry. \u201cOrdinarily, my mum would be over to watch the match with me (she doesn\u2019t have streaming). Except that she called me at one to tell me that she was still so annoyed over Manchester City\u2019s performance yesterday that she just can\u2019t bear to watch Liverpool today. She\u2019s devoted to City. My mother is 75. She\u2019s apparently more hardcore than my dad ever was.\u201d That\u2019s outstanding. 55 min Arsenal are having much more of the ball in this half. That comes with the risk of Liverpool counter-attacks, so I doubt this will end 2-1. 54 min \u201cCan I be the first person in human history to compare Liverpool to the entirely wonderful, relentless, post-punk trio THIS HEAT?\u201d says Russell Richardson. \u201c\u2018Metal\u2019 just won\u2019t do to describe their ferocity. Just listen to the first bars of the first track on their first (1979) album to see my point: Horizontal Hold.\u201d 52 min Arsenal have already had twice as many touches in the Liverpool area in this half (four) as they did throughout the first half. 51 min Alexander-Arnold\u2019s dangerous volleyed cross is calmly chested away by David Luiz at the near post. He\u2019s played well tonight. As has been said many times, he looks so much better in a back three. 50 min \u201cI had 13 vodka red bulls one night and didn\u2019t sleep until the day after,\u201d shivers Matthew Stephens. \u201cI was as shaky as an Arsenal\u2019s defensive line. Haven\u2019t touched the stuff since.\u201d The hipster booze revolution came too late for our generation of students, eh. The closest thing to craft beer at Keele was Carlsberg Export. 49 min Arsenal have started the second half with greater intent. Lacazette tees up the off-balance Maitland-Niles, whose shot would have gone out for a throw-in had it not hit van Dijk. 49 min Alexander-Arnold is booked for a late tackle on Tierney. 47 min Mane almost makes it 3-1, blasting over the bar from the edge of the area after a clipped ball over the top from Wijnaldum. Leno had it covered. 46 min Peep peep! Liverpool begin the second half. \u201cFor melodic heavy metal look no further than Norway\u2019s finest \u2013 Kvelertak,\u201d writes Iain Gray. \u201cUtterly bonkersly magnificent.\u201d Half-time reading \u201cWhat do you do to counteract Liverpool\u2019s full backs?\u201d wonders John Dublin. \u201cDo you invent a position called the holding winger, where the main function of the player is to basically cover every run of the full back and not much is expected from them in an attacking sense; think James McClean as a reference. This would put extra pressure on Liverpool\u2019s midfield to be creative which hasn\u2019t always been their strong suit but, the arrival of Thiago has probably solved that issue.\u201d Plenty of teams have tried that \u2013 not just against Liverpool but also Barcelona when they had Jordi Alba and Dani Alves. Sir Alex Ferguson often used Park in that role, not just against Barcelona. I\u2019ve never seen a better pair of attacking full-backs in English football, so goodness knows what you\u2019re supposed to do. The threat is so different as well: Robertson is all about buccaneering runs and precise low crosses, whereas Alexander-Arnold can put in devastating crosses from almost any position. Peep peep! Arsenal had the effrontery to take the lead through Alexandre Lacazette after a comedy howler from Andy Robertson. Liverpool - who were already well on top - responded ferociously. Sadio Mane equalised a few moments later and Robertson summed up Liverpool\u2019s mentality monstrousness by making up for his error and putting Liverpool ahead. It\u2019s not entirely palatable for supporters of their rivals, but Liverpool are just awesome. 45 min Two minutes of added time. 43 min Actually, I think Maitland-Niles was offside anyway. 42 min David Luiz waves a long pass over the top of the Liverpool defence to put Maitland-Niles, but his first touch is poor and the ball runs through to Alisson. It wasn\u2019t the easiest ball to control, but had he done so he would have been clear. 40 min \u201cIn the mid-1970s, a \u2018hosepipe\u2019 was briefly all the rage down our way,\u201d says Duncan Edwards. \u201cHalf of Guinness, double brandy, and a barley wine all in a pint glass. A fearsome combo. More recently I took a sip of Red Bull which was more than enough.\u201d Why can I suddenly smell Embassy Regal? 39 min Arsenal cannot get out. Holding\u2019s pass goes straight to Firmino, 30 yards from goal. He combines with Wijnaldum and Mane to almost release Robertson, who is superbly tracked by the second right-back Willian. 38 min Here\u2019s Scott Blair on the subject of melodic heavy metal. \u201cI\u2019d suggest UFO, which rather nicely opens the door to a they\u2019re Too Hot To Handle reference at some appropriate juncture in the match.\u201d 36 min Arsenal have done quite well in this half, yet they have been absolutely battered. I\u2019m sorry, this is just awesome. They are utterly relentless. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s deep cross skims off the head of Bellerin and reaches Robertson, who controls it on the chest and pokes it past Leno. I\u2019m surprised VAR didn\u2019t look at it for a possible handball, if only because his arms were tight to his body. That said, I\u2019m pretty sure it was okay. Andy Robertson makes up for his mistake by putting Liverpool ahead. 34 min Liverpool have had 76 per cent possession and nine shots to Arsenal\u2019s one. 33 min \u201cRight,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cOnly Connect is finished, I can give the match my full attention. Heavy metal football, but with plenty of melody. Also, an astonishing amount of technical ability and creativity. By way of comparison, I offer the musical stylings of Between The Buried And Me to the MBM collective. Listen to their album Colors, and thank me later.\u201d 32 min Liverpool\u2019s intensity with and without the ball is incredible. It\u2019s a shame they didn\u2019t play Bayern Munich in the Champions League final; it could have been an all-time classic. 31 min \u201cJ\u00fcrgen Klopp has a tough job,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cWith so many good midfielders at his disposal he can\u2019t possibly Keita to everyone\u2019s preferences.\u201d The equaliser came from an excellent advantage by the referee Craig Pawson after a foul by David Luiz on Keita. Firmino picked up the loose ball and played it to Salah, who surged thrillingly away from Tierney - his first touch into the space was marvellous - and whipped a shot that was beaten away by Leno. It rebounded straight to Mane, who cushioned a volley into the empty net. Going ahead against Liverpool isn\u2019t always advisable. 27 min Lacazette was miles offside but it didn\u2019t matter because Robertson played the ball through to him. It was Hackney Marshes fare. That was Arsenal\u2019s first decent counter-attack of the entire game. They broke the Liverpool press and Lacazette found Maitland-Niles on the left. His cross was poor but Robertson made a complete hash of a routine clearance, miscuing the ball straight to Lacazette in front of goal. He turned and mishit a volley that bounced over the stretching Alisson, who had gone down expecting a cleaner contact. Arsenal take the lead with a farcical goal! 24 min David Luiz gets away with his first mistake. He tried to play out from inside the Arsenal area and gave the ball to Alexander-Arnold. He combined with Keita to tee up Wijnaldum, whose low shot from inside the D was straight at Leno. 23 min \u201cThe midfield tonight for Liverpool is missing its best two players,\u201d says Ciaran Hanley. \u201cI was looking forward to seeing Thiago against a deep-lying defence as that was the main reason he was bought. Henderson is often missed when he\u2019s not playing. So Fabinho, Wijnaldum and in particular Keita need to step up tonight. Fab has to be good defensively, Wijnaldum has to get in the box and Keita has to create.\u201d You\u2019re right, but sometimes it feels like the front three and full-backs are so good that they could play me, you and Homer Simpson in central midfield and still score three or four. 21 min: Alexander-Arnold hits the bar! Robertson\u2019s outswinging corner was headed away by David Luiz. It came to Alexander-Arnold, who spanked the sweetest half-volley towards goal from 25 yards. The ball hit Bellerin, bounced into the ground and then up onto the bar. 21 min \u201cAnother Everton fan hoping for a draw,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cIt\u2019s positively juvenile how much pleasure I get from being above the Reds, I know winter is coming and it will not last, but every day at the top, point wise, is an amazing opportunity for joy. Sad, but true.\u201d 20 min Arsenal have barely had a kick, yet Mikel Arteta will be pretty happy I think. They\u2019ve been compact and error-free at the back, and Leno has only one save to make. 16 min \u201cI really want to see a team kick off and score while the opposition are taking a knee,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cDon Revie\u2019s Leeds might have done that. And it was brandy and Red Bull if you really liked mixing your stimulants.\u201d I\u2019ve drunk some filth in my time but that is too much. 15 min It\u2019s all Liverpool. Alexander-Arnold crosses towards the near post, where Mane sweeps a half-volley at goal. It\u2019s beautifully struck but straight at Leno, who beats it away. 13 min A nice training-ground corner from Liverpool. Robertson, on the left, angles it sharply back towards Salah, who arrives late and spanks it over the bar. It was a difficult chance, on the run and under pressure, though it wouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to see him roof it. 12 min: David Luiz heads off the line! Alexander-Arnold won the ball off Tierney on the right wing and hit a magnificent first-time cross towards the far post. Van Dijk, who was still up from a corner, headed back across Leno and David Luiz nutted the ball behind for a corner. I\u2019m not sure it was going in but David Luiz took no chances. 11 min Arsenal are sitting very deep, as they did so successfully against Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final. They haven\u2019t yet had any decent counter-attacks, but then nor had Leicester at this stage of their game yesterday. 9 min \u201cNow that your lot are shite for the foreseeable, I can look back with a less jaundiced eye,\u201d says Paul Ewart. \u201cSo the question I have for you, is was Anderson a) any good, b) a solid citizen, or c) a disappointment. We can all see that Naby\u2019s a player but it\u2019s make-or-break for him now.\u201d He had some great games in his first season, especially away to the bigger sides, but got worse as time went on. He remained an essential part of the Arsenal Kryptonite midfield (Fletcher, Carrick, Anderson) but became more of a cult figure. Ultimately he was a disappointment because he had such potential. He was 19 when he played brilliantly at the Emirates and Anfield. 7 min Nothing much is happening. You\u2019re welcome! 5 min Lots of early possession for Liverpool, who are playing with a level of confidence that is almost illegal. They are so good to watch. It might be heavy-metal football but there\u2019s plenty of melody in there as well. There\u2019ll be even more once Thiago gets in the team. 3 min Tierney goes down after being hit in the face by Mane. It was more of a shove than a punch, and Mane is booked. It wasn\u2019t a million miles from a red-card offence, but a yellow card was probably right. 2 min \u201cI am a committed Naby fan as I watched him carry Red Bull,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201cand I don\u2019t just mean in bags from the offie.\u201d That last image gave me a little chill. Remember when trolleying double vodka Red Bulls by night seemed a good idea? 1 min Peep peep! Arsenal, in their bloody away kit, kick off from left to right. \u201cCan we play Xhaka yellow card bingo?\u201d says Ruth Purdue. \u201cI have the 12th minute. Any takers?\u201d Bingo responsibly. The players are out on the field and ready for action. The next two hours shouldn\u2019t be dull. \u201cUnder Arteta, Arsenal seem to have coherent strategies,\u201d writes Juan. \u201cTeam selection is easy to understand and appropriate to his tactics for each game. The players look as if they know what they are doing. Won\u2019t help us tonight, mind.\u201d \u201cKeita moves the ball forward in central areas by running with it or quick short passes,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201c I\u2019m not sure how effective that\u2019s been in this team that likes to attack from out wide but I like watching it.\u201d Oh aye, I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s the new Istvan Kozma; he just hasn\u2019t stood out when I\u2019ve seen him. That said, and odd as it sounds, it\u2019s hard to judge non-highlights players when you do a liveblog because you spend half the match typing/looking at emails/being asked whether you get paid to write this. \u201cAs an Everton fan it\u2019s exceedingly rare to be looking down on either of these teams in the table, let alone both of them, so under the circumstances my desired outcome is a draw,\u201d says Matt Burtz. \u201cIf Liverpool must win, I would prefer it if it\u2019s only by one goal. If Arsenal wins, well, let\u2019s reckon with that if it actually happens. And yes, I\u2019m aware that only three games have been played, but I\u2019ll take what I can get.\u201d \u201cNaby Keita seems to be getting a run of games at the moment, regardless of who else is fit,\u201d says Ben Raza. \u201cHe\u2019s blown hot and cold (and, mainly, lukewarm) since he came to Anfield. The early part of this season looks like his last big chance I reckon.\u201d I half thought Curtis Jones might start tonight. Keita has never been that impressive when I\u2019ve seen him, but I get the impression I\u2019ve missed his better games. Liverpool have serious depth in central midfield now. Diogo Jota is on the bench for Liverpool, but Thiago is out with a minor injury. Alisson starts - he was doubtful with an unspecified injury - and Fabinho moves back into midfield to replace the injured Jordan Henderson. Mikel Arteta has picked a slightly more cautious team: Rob Holding, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Mohamed Elneny preferred to Gabriel, Bukayo Saka and Dani Ceballos. The new goalkeeper Alex Runarsson is on the bench. Liverpool (4-3-3) Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, van Dijk, Robertson; Keita, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Mane. Substitutes: Adrian, Williams, Milner, Jones, Minamino, Jota, Origi. Arsenal (3-4-3) Leno; Holding, David Luiz, Tierney; Bellerin, Elneny, Xhaka, Maitland-Niles; Willian, Lacazette, Aubameyang. Substitutes: Runarsson, Gabriel, Saka, Kolasinac, Ceballos, Pepe, Nketiah. Pre-match reading Aston Villa are hammering Fulham at Craven Cottage in the early game. It\u2019s 3-0 just after half-time: Jack Grealish, Conor Hourihane and Tyrone Mings scored the goals. Arsenal: your country needs you. Sure, it\u2019s the same country that has sneered at you for most of the past decade, but you must understand that it was only banter. Besides, we all need a favour. Because if somebody doesn\u2019t undermine Liverpool pretty soon, the 2020-21 title race will be over by Christmas for the second year in a row. While the rest of the Big Six have started the season in varying states of shambles, Arsenal have won their first two games and start tonight\u2019s match above Liverpool on goal difference. Yes, those wins were against Fulham and West Ham, but they have continued Arsenal\u2019s obvious improvement under Mikel Arteta. They beat Liverpool, albeit in a dead rubber, at the back end of last season and then again on penalties in the Community Shield. Anfield is a whole new level of difficulty, a place where Arsenal have been taken apart in recent seasons. On their last eight visits, they have conceded a bruising 30 goals. Arsenal do have the players to hurt a Liverpool defence that has been a bit slapdash in recent months. But while they have improved at the back themselves, keeping Liverpool quiet at Anfield is nigh-on impossible. For Gabriel, David Luiz and Kieran Tierney - for the whole Arsenal team - this is the real quiz. Liverpool are an awesome team who, at the moment, look unstoppable. So did Arsenal in the autumn of 2002 and 2004, yet they didn\u2019t win the league in either season. Things can change, such is the primacy of confidence, but for that to happen somebody needs to urgently introduce Liverpool\u2019s mentality monsters to the concept of self-doubt. Leeds almost managed it; Chelsea didn\u2019t come close. Now it\u2019s Arsenal\u2019s turn. For once, the nation is with them.
