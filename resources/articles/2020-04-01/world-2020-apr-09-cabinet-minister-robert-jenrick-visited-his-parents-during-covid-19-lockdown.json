The Guardian has established that the housing, communities and local government secretary \u2013 who has made media appearances urging people to save lives by remaining in their properties even if tempted to see loved ones \u2013 went to see his parents at their Shropshire home, 40 miles by road from his own. A witness has told the Guardian they saw Jenrick, 38, visiting the property at the weekend. A source close to the cabinet minister admitted that he had made the journey during lockdown conditions, but defended the trip by saying he dropped off food and medication, and did not enter the house. Jenrick later confirmed this in a tweet in which he said his parents were both self-isolating, because of age and his father\u2019s medical condition, and he had respected social distancing rules. Government instructions say: \u201cYou should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home.\u201d The only exception is if they need help, such as having shopping or medication dropped off. The Guardian understands that the local community has been supporting Jenrick\u2019s parents by delivering groceries in recent weeks. This was not denied, though the source said Jenrick had collected and delivered medication for his parents, too. On Thursday night it emerged that the minister had also travelled between London and his home in Herefordshire, which is not in his constituency of Newark in Nottinghamshire. In an article for the Mail on Sunday just over two weeks ago, Jenrick argued that rather than relatives travelling, local communities should help out. \u201cWhile we create physical distance between ourselves, we must at the same time have closer social support for our neighbour,\u201d he wrote. The visit came after Jenrick appealed for people not to visit their family on Mother\u2019s Day. \u201cThe advice today is very clear, we need to stay at home for all bar the most essential activities, and by doing that we\u2019ll protect the NHS and help to save lives,\u201d he told Sky News on 22 March. \u201cI know it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day and I know it\u2019s tough and it goes against everything that we want to do as a family but don\u2019t go and see your mum. Give her a phone call, Skype her, FaceTime her, tell her that you love her and that we\u2019re going to get through this together.\u201d Jenrick was seen by a witness in his parents\u2019 front garden. His father and mother, who are 79 and 69, live in a detached house in a town in Shropshire. It is more than an hour\u2019s drive from the MP\u2019s home in Herefordshire, from where he has been doing TV interviews. While Jenrick\u2019s decision appears to contrast with his instructions to the public, it will be familiar to many facing the dilemma of whether to help elderly parents or stay away. Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, was forced to quit at the weekend after facing intense criticism for breaking her own rules by twice visiting her second home during the coronavirus outbreak. The Friday before Jenrick went to see his parents, he tweeted: \u201cIf you are considering going out this weekend, please don\u2019t, unless it\u2019s for work (where you cannot work from home), health reasons, food shopping or exercise. We need to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives.\u201d In a strongly worded comment piece for the Mail on Sunday on 22 March, Jenrick reinforced his message urging the country to stay at home on Mother\u2019s Day. He wrote: \u201cWe are facing a huge challenge on a scale not seen since the second world war. It\u2019s not just a national emergency, it\u2019s a global emergency \u2013 one which puts some of us at more risk than others. The choices that we must make over the coming days and weeks can save many lives. \u201cThat means families making big sacrifices \u2013 especially today, on Mother\u2019s Day. It\u2019s so important that we speak to our loved ones as much as we can \u2013 whether that\u2019s FaceTime or a phone call. But for now, we must practise social distancing in order to tackle the spread of the virus. We need to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. But while we create physical distance between ourselves, we must at the same time have closer social support for our neighbours.\u201d In the article, the minister highlighted that those who were self-isolating and did not have support from family, friends or neighbours would receive support from volunteers. On Thursday, Dominic Raab signalled the government\u2019s continued advocacy of the stay-at-home policy, telling the public: \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see the impact of the sacrifices we\u2019ve all made.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are not done yet. We must keep going.\u201d Responding to the Guardian\u2019s story, Jenrick tweeted: \u201cFor clarity \u2013 my parents asked me to deliver some essentials \u2013 including medicines. They are both self-isolating due to age and my father\u2019s medical condition and I respected social distancing rules.\u201d On the subject of his travel between Herefordshire and London, Jenrick told the Daily Mail: \u201cMy house in Herefordshire is the place I, my wife and my young children consider to be our family home and my family were there before any restrictions on travel were announced. \u201cI have been working in London on ministerial duties, putting in place the system to shield the group most vulnerable to coronavirus and organising the response at a local level. Once I was able to work from home it was right that I went home to do so and be with my wife and also help care for my three young children. By staying at home, we protect the NHS and help save lives. \u201cI will be staying at my family home until government advice changes or if I am needed in person in Westminster before the parliamentary session resumes after the Easter recess.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
