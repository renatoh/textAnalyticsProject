Last summer, it had been a regular haunt, thanks to the men\u2019s World Cup, which filled the beer garden for almost every match, whether England were playing or not. On that first Sunday afternoon, two televisions were on, cricket on one and rugby on the other. I asked the landlady if they were showing the World Cup. She hadn\u2019t known it was on, she said, but she gave one of the screens to us and we sat there, an audience of two, cheering bashfully. That already feels like a long time ago. What a delight this tournament has been. Support has grown as the games have progressed and England made their way to a semi-final once again. I\u2019m a relative newcomer to enjoying sport, and certainly football, but the women\u2019s game feels welcoming to someone like me. I never would have dreamed that I\u2019d be talking about starting lineups and reading match reports, but I\u2019ve begun to have tentative conversations about them, the words new and cautious as they form. I have never known the names of an entire football team... until now. The cheering has become less bashful already. Obviously it helps that England are doing well, thus far, but what has made it so heartwarming is the underdog narrative you find in every corner. Dig into the stories of the players, especially in nations where the women\u2019s game is not well supported, and you\u2019ll find tales of tenacity, of bloody-minded persistence, of women being told they can\u2019t, and they shouldn\u2019t, but finding a way to do it anyway. Phil Neville has called Lucy Bronze \u201cthe best player in the world\u201d. When she scored that magnificent goal in Thursday\u2019s quarter-final against Norway, it reminded me of Bronze\u2019s brilliant, inspirational story, one of injuries and multiple knee operations followed by a self-devised and self-imposed rehabilitation programme that gave her back her career. In one interview, she talked about being given their England kit and the players having to rip the netting out of the shorts because they had been designed for men. The netting is, she said, no longer there. Whatever happens in the game against the US on Tuesday night, this tournament has been a beautiful relief from the drudgery of the daily political grind. It has made me feel patriotic in a way that I have rarely felt before. And I am certain that it will be playing on every screen in my local. Emily Maitlis: it\u2019s a dog\u2019s life if you offend train etiquette Pity Emily Maitlis, who could not have known that a simple train journey with a sleeping dog would generate the most column inches about her since she rolled her eyes at Barry Gardiner. The presenter was pictured on a train going to London Paddington with her whippet curled up on the seat next to her. Before seeing the photograph, when I read the headlines, my immediate thought was, I bet she has a whippet. I have a whippet and no settee, bed or armchair is safe from her; she treats laps as cushions and if forced to lie down on the floor will not sleep, but only stare at you with her eyes narrowed in disgust. I felt for Maitlis, not least because the train was clearly quiet enough that the person behind her could put their feet on the seat, which is a worse offence, in my opinion. But train etiquette is a nightmare. For everyone who can\u2019t stand the tinny rattle of a too-loud earbud, there\u2019s another person who can\u2019t abide the hum of a warm egg sandwich. Mine is nail polish. I\u2019ve had to move seats because a fellow traveller was painting their nails. I didn\u2019t ask them to stop, but then again, I didn\u2019t take a photo of them either. I once wrote about the enjoyment of taking your dog on holiday. Shortly after that piece was published, I had to take my dog on a train, which ended up being packed because of cancellations. I thought she\u2019d curl up peacefully at my feet, but she sat up throughout the journey, farting anxiously and revoltingly. What happened at the B&amp;B later is another horror story entirely. After that, I vowed only to take my dog on public transport if there\u2019s no way around it, which is kinder to everyone and kinder to me. Joe Lycett: let the fast-food wars commence With an investigation that will chill the stomachs of those who regularly order takeaways, the BBC has discovered that it is possible to set up a restaurant and use the Uber Eats delivery service \u201cwith no identity checks, bank details or food hygiene rating\u201d. To illustrate this point, it set up a fake restaurant in someone\u2019s front yard called Best Burger Corp and barbecued burgers on a grubby grill. Despite looking like something Emily Maitlis wouldn\u2019t feed her dog, the food was sold to a punter. \u201cWe are working hard to ensure this does not happen again,\u201d Uber Eats told the BBC. But something about the story repeated on me like a dodgy kebab. In April, the comedian Joe Lycett had the same idea for his Channel 4 show Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back, which was a bit like Watchdog with stunts. The new Anne Robinson made his point by setting up a restaurant called Le Sauter in an actual skip and he still managed to sell a pork korma. I know the real point is that these companies\u2019 checks need urgently reviewing, but still, I\u2019d like to see Best Burger Corp and Le Sauter in a cook-off to the death. Let\u2019s face it, that might well be the end result. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
