A crowd of Japanese supporters were filing dejectedly through the drizzle out of Miyagi Stadium after their team had been knocked out, when one suddenly burst into a chorus of God Save the Queen. That a Japanese fan could have felt moved to sing the British national anthem might once have been considered unusual. That he knew the words to the first two verses - unlike 99% of England's fans - ought to have been astonishing. But after almost three weeks of many similarly remarkable displays of Japanese affection towards the land of St George nothing is surprising any more. Before the start of the World Cup the British Embassy in Tokyo spent months trying to counter the widely held perception that all English fans were hooligans. Now they are working on ways to milk the good vibes that they hope will be left behind when Sven-Goran Eriksson's team and their thousands of travelling fans return home. Over the past 20 days Anglophilia has scaled heights that the FA could only have dreamed of. Diplomats and businessmen are drooling at the potential trade, tourism and media spin-offs. \"Perceptions of England have shifted noticeably since the start of the World Cup,\" said Stuart Jack, minister at the British Embassy. \"What we'd like to do is keep that going and take advantage of it to make Japanese people, especially the young, look more at Britain for its cool lifestyle, as a fun place to visit and study.\" But it is not so much Cool Britannia as warm England that is attracting young Japanese, who have been quick to join in the hokey cokey, conga and other drunken celebrations. \"We Japanese are too quiet. I want to dance with the English,\" said Hiromi Makisaka, a 22-year-old beautician. \"And after the World Cup I want to visit England so that I can see David Beckham.\" So many Japanese fans have bought England shirts, painted St George's crosses on their cheeks and had their hair dyed and styled into Beckham Mohawks that Sven-Goran Eriksson's team have almost been playing at home in their first four games. \"Usually with England the locals tend to be hostile or fearful but here there is a genuine warmth towards us,\" said Gavin Burnage of the Football Supporters' Association. \"People have gone out of their way to show us around, the police have given us presents and we have been invited to come back and stay.\" Brazil and Senegal also have strong support in Japan but, while their backing is based on their football skills or their underdog status, England's appeal derives from its pop icon captain. \"The Japanese media have focused almost entirely on Beckham and to a lesser extent Michael Owen,\" said Ko Tanaka, a writer for the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. \"They don't think about the English team or England. Hardly anyone knows [Trevor] Sinclair or [Teddy] Sheringham. I doubt if half the young fans could even name Tony Blair.\" But the England and Beckham phenomenon has already meant a bumper payday for Umbro and the dozens of British hawkers selling imitation shirts outside the stadiums, where about three-quarters of the 40,000 England supporters have been Japanese. Others are set to follow. Rupert Murdoch can expect to cash in through increased subscriptions to Sky broadcasts of Premiership matches and Manchester United's marketing managers will be rubbing their hands at the prospect of shifting tens of thousands more strips in the world's second biggest economy. Other business is already poised to reap the rewards. Bobby Charlton is fronting a BBC-backed project to teach English through football, and the UK-based International Academy football school will launch a Japanese institution next week. But the love of England could still prove to be nothing more than this summer's fashion unless the principal objects of adoration return or new ones are added. If Junichi Inamoto signs a new contract with Arsenal or Hidetoshi Nakata joins an English club, then satellite subscriptions, shirts sales and tourism from Japan will soar. But there is no doubt that the player who could do more than anyone for Anglo-Japanese relations is Beckham, and his hint this week that he might end his career in the Far East will have excited grizzled diplomats and canny businessmen as much as the teenage girls."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
