Neither of the two so-called legacy retailers - which have been squeezed by the supermarkets and specialist retailers - produced sparkling sales figures. But they backed up their top-line sales reports with encouraging updates on margins and market share. The poorer performer, in terms of sales, was WH Smith, with comparative sales in the 673 high-street outlets down 2% in the six-week period to January 15. The chief executive, Kate Swann, however, said her strategy of cancelling unprofitable promotions and tight cost controls meant \"profitability is substantially ahead of last year\". Several analysts, including the house broker Cazenove, raisedprofit forecasts. Ms Swann halted \"2 for \u00a320\" hardback book promotions and sales fell - but the downturn, she said, was offset by higher margins. She added that new stationery ranges, better buying terms and improved availability were also having an impact. The group's airport and railway outlets turned in comparative growth of 4%. \"Airports are doing well and passenger numbers are up,\" said Ms Swann. \"But we are growing ahead of that.\" The improvement, she said, was a result of stocking more confectionery and new Post Office-style queuing systems. The hardest market was music and DVDs, where supermarkets and chains such as HMV have been winning market share. In addition, said the chief executive, several of the key DVDs had failed to hit their sales targets. \"Shrek 2 was the first big release and right across the market, it performed at only 50% of the level the studio had predicted. Harry Potter only did 60%.\" Its rival Woolworths blamed pirates for the shortfall but Ms Swann said: \"We did not notice that particularly\". In the run-up to Christmas WH Smith had been the City's favourite for a poor festive season, and there was widespread criticism of some of Ms Swann's changes - such as packing the stores with big new fixtures and more product lines. The shares lost more than 15% in little more than a month, falling to 295p, but have since come back and, with yesterday's update, added 19p to close at 359.25p. \"It was frustrating pre-Christmas,\" said Ms Swann, \"but we have delivered what we said we would and that is a nice position to be in. I am pleased for our shareholders and our staff, but this is a long-term recovery programme and much remains to be done.\" At Boots, comparative sales at the high-street outlets were ahead 2.6% - at the lower end of analysts' expectations - but the group chief executive, Richard Baker, said market share was up and that profits would hit City expectations. The chain has slashed prices on 3,000 lines to become more competitive with the supermarkets, and price deflation is running at 2.4%. Gross profit margins in the three months to December 31 were flat, suggesting Boots has been buying in cheaper products. Mr Baker said: \"We are progressing well.\" Prescription-generated sales were 7.2% higher, year on year, but fewer coughs and colds meant flat sales for medicines sold over the counter. Gifts, baby products, premium cosmetics and perfumes were all big sellers but electricals underperformed. Sales of core toiletries were down 0.8%, mainly because of price cuts. Analysts remain divided on the chain's prospects, but the shares rose 2.5p to 662p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
