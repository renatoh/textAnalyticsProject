The Metropolitan police said they arrested a 37-year-old Venezuelan national at Gatwick under the Terrorism Act 2000 after finding what they believed to be a live hand grenade in his luggage. He had travelled to London on a British Airways flight that originated in Colombia and made a stop in Barbados. The Metropolitan police said in a statement: \"On arrival at the airport the man's luggage was searched and found to contain a suspicious item. The item has been examined by explosives officers and it appears to be a live grenade.\" The suspect was being transferred into the custody of the anti terrorist branch and was being taken to a central London police station for questioning. Officials evacuated part of the Gatwick's north terminal during the alert. Flights were disrupted and passengers on in-bound flights at the north terminal were forced to wait in the aircrafts. All scheduled flights from the north terminal have been suspended until further notice, police said, with incoming flights being diverted to the south terminal. In a separate incident, police said they detained two men in Hounslow, west London, near Heathrow, under the terrorism act 2000 as a \"precautionary measure\". They did not say what led to the arrests. However, the incident is not believed to be connected to the mass security operation at Heathrow or to a plot to attack the airport. The men were taken to a police station in west London for questioning. At Stansted airport in Essex, police announced that they will close the access road to the terminal building to the public from tomorrow morning due to increased security measures. Police and Stansted airport authorities said the road closure was a routine measure and was not as a result of a direct threat. The home secretary, David Blunkett, today told parliament he would not give a \"running commentary\" on the threat to the UK from al-Qaida to explain the reasons behind the government's decision to have the army encircle Heathrow and other British airports. \"Our view is that we must do nothing to undermine the work of the police and the security services,\" he told MPs. \"We have to make fine judgments which must ensure the safety of sources of information. The terrorists must not be able to assess what we know and how we know it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
