Other men stand around and a police dog strains at its leash. After several minutes, she is hauled to a waiting van, her trousers around her ankles, her body limp. Toni Comer, who is now 20, had been at a nightclub in Sheffield last July when it happened. She had been thrown out of the club earlier and had damaged a car in the car park. This week, she was ordered to pay \u00a3250 compensation to the car's owner but is launching her own case against the police. Her lawyer, Danny Simpson, says she was suffering an epileptic fit and was \"punched five or so times until she would say she was unconscious\". The police officer claimed he was acting in self defence. It is the first time that what appears to be excessive force used against a female suspect has been caught on camera, but by no means the first time it has happened. \"There are - and have been - cases of women being the victims of excessive force and restraint,\" says Harriet Wistrich, a solicitor who has dealt with many cases of complaints of violence against the police. \"It does happen. I have a number of female clients who have been assaulted by the police. It does seem to involve women from ethnic minorities.\" There have been examples. In 1985, Cynthia Jarrett died of heart failure after four police officers burst into her home during a raid. A resident of Tottenham, in north London, her death sparked the riots on the Broadwater Farm estate. And, in the early hours of July 8 1993, the home of Joy Gardner, a 40-year-old woman from Jamaica who had overstayed her visa, was raided and she was held down by several police officers in front of her five-year-old son. She was shackled with handcuffs and a body belt, and 13ft of tape was wrapped around her mouth to stop her screaming. She fell into a coma and never recovered. Two years later, three officers stood trial for her manslaughter, but were acquitted. Nina Hobson is a former police officer whose film Undercover Copper was shown last year on Channel 4's Dispatches series. Was she shocked by the CCTV pictures of Comer? \"Yes I was,\" she says. \"I was surprised it was done so openly, rather than that it was done at all. I've seen officers who have got out of hand, but it's definitely down to individual officers. Some were quicker to use force than others and I've worked with officers who would make sure they were in the thick of it. Other officers would try to calm the situation down and female police officers, especially, seemed more likely to want to talk the situation down rather than use violence.\" Hobson says she thinks the police treat drunk and disorderly people the same, whether they are male or female. \"The idea is that you use as much force as necessary,\" she says. \"There are some women who can fight and kick like a man and if you have to use force, that's what you do.\" But others believe that women who do not conform to the idea of \"feminine\" behaviour are punished for it. \"There seems to be some kind of pattern in that where women don't behave like they should - when they go and get drunk or dress in a particular way - where they step outside the boundaries of acceptable behaviour, they can expect harsh treatment,\" says Wistrich. \"There have been attempts within the police force to change, especially when it comes to dealing with allegations of rape, but there does seem to be this reaction among police officers when women behave in a way they don't understand.\" But if women want equality, shouldn't they be treated like men when it comes to arrest? \"Proper control and restraint methods don't include punching someone in the face,\" says Wistrich. If physical assault against female suspected \"criminals\" by police officers is at one end of the police's relationship with women, at the other is how female victims of crimes are treated. Rape is the obvious example. A report earlier this year said a third of rape cases that were dropped - because of a lack of evidence or because the woman lacked \"credibility\" - should have been pursued. Not that those cases that are pursued have much chance anyway: just 5.6% of reported rapes result in a conviction. Perhaps the most telling comparison between how women are treated then and now is to be found in two television documentaries. In 1982, Roger Graef's film An Allegation of Rape showed a woman, who had alleged that she had been raped by three strangers, being interviewed by three male officers. The officers were bullying and disbelieving - one of them said, \"This is the biggest bollocks I've ever heard.\" The film provoked an outrage and the way police treated rape victims changed. Or did it? In 2006, Hobson's Dispatches documentary showed that in a quarter of a century, we are not as advanced as we liked to think. The film raised deeply disturbing questions about how seriously rape is taken now. A senior officer said an allegation of rape should be taken \"with a pinch of salt\" because it had been made by a prostitute. A scene-of-crime officer was not sent to the house of a victim to collect evidence. One female officer in the documentary said she would not bother reporting it if she had been raped. \"We still hear police officers saying, 'She asked for it, she had a short skirt on.' I thought we might have moved on, but we quite clearly haven't,\" said Hobson in the film. Domestic violence is another area where police are regularly accused of not taking women's allegations seriously. In a high-profile case in 2003, police repeatedly ignored pleas for help from Julia Pemberton. She had told police that her ex-husband, Alan, had threatened to kill her. When he broke into her house and shot her and their teenage son William before killing himself, it still took police nearly seven hours from when Pemberton dialled 999 to when they entered the house. Three months before that, Rana Faruqui was stabbed to death by her ex-partner Stephen Griffiths, despite her complaint to police two weeks earlier that Griffiths had tampered with the brakes on her car. Clare Bernal, who worked on a beauty counter in the London department store Harvey Nichols, was shot by her former boyfriend, had told police that he had threatened to kill her five months before he did. One issue that the images of Comer should raise is why there were no female police officers there to deal with her. \"If there had been, they would have gone in first,\" says Heather Murray, a retired superintendent. \"Obviously there were none available at the scene.\" Just 24% of police constables are women, with fewer women higher up the ranks. Overall, 22% of the police force is female. \"The bottom line is about police forces valuing their female staff,\" says Liz Owsley, national coordinator of the British Association for Women in Policing. \"The majority do, but some don't.\" She points to the lack of female uniforms in specialist jobs as just one example. \"Progression can still be difficult. Women are sometimes not encouraged or given the same encouragement.\" When Owsley joined the force in 1979, it was, she says, a very different place. \"I remember a couple of supervisors when I was a young inspector who thought that women shouldn't be in work, let alone in the police.\" And now? \"I think there is still some way to go,\" she says carefully."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
