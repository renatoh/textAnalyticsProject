He is a professor of addiction studies and services at Monash University, director of the Monash Addiction Research Centre, and executive clinical director of the treatment, education and research centre Turning Point.

While many people could identify what addictive behaviours might look like, Lubman says visible signs are the tip of the iceberg. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just the act of using drugs or drinking,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s far more complex. It\u2019s about underlying trauma, isolation or mental health, as well as social and cultural challenges people face.\u201d Essentially, there is not one exact cause. \u201cThere are genetic factors: we know from research that it is one of the most heritable conditions,\u201d Lubman says, referencing studies that found children adopted out from families with addiction still had a high risk of developing problems themselves. \u201cThere are also environmental triggers: mental health issues, trauma, stress, lack of support or connection \u2026 these factors make it more likely that someone will develop an addiction.\u201d Importantly, these complexities demonstrate that in many ways, addiction is just like any other health disorder - because it is one. Lubman says the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) classifies addiction as a mental disorder, alongside depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The World Health Organisation defines dependency as a syndrome that is \u201ca cluster of physiological, behavioural and cognitive phenomena\u201d. So if dependency is a chronic health condition, why is the discourse around addiction so different compared to diabetes or PTSD? At a community level, a lack of understanding sits alongside a celebrated heavy drinking culture, Lubman says. \u201cAustralians loves to drink and gamble. But when someone develops a problem, rather than asking \u2018What\u2019s going on for this person? How can we understand them in a compassionate way?\u2019, the narrative is often, \u2018They\u2019ve brought it on themselves\u2019.\u201d Media depictions, with denigrating labels such as \u201caddict\u201d, only increase stigma, he says. Adding to this is the push from industry to avoid responsibility and remain profitable. \u201cAlcohol and gambling industries put the responsibility on the individual, not the product, which we know is dangerous,\u201d Lubman says. Drug, gambling and alcohol treatments are underfunded and inconsistent. Lubman compares someone presenting to a GP with a breast lump, and having \u201chealthcare doors open up\u201d and support teams emerge. But with addiction, health professionals might not know how to respond, and treatment and support can be fragmented. \u201cYou\u2019re not offered messages of hope or support,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are expected to sort it out for themselves. They\u2019re judged and blamed. If you applied these attitudes and approaches to other areas of health, we\u2019d be disgusted. We\u2019d see it as an injustice.\u201d This lack of understanding and negative stereotypes increase marginalisation. Crucially, this stops people seeking help. \u201cBecause of shame and stigma, it can take people up to 20 years to present for treatment,\u201d Lubman says. \u201cBy this time, they not only have an addiction, but a range of other complications related to their health and social world.\u201d Source: \u2018Alcohol and Drug Foundation Alcohol and other drugs: Stigma. A background paper (2019) A 2017 report exploring attitudes towards alcohol and drugs found a high level of stigma associated with accessing treatment, even among drug users (for many, treatment was seen as a last resort, and only for the \u201cmost addictive, scary\u201d substances). For people to get better, this topic must no longer be taboo. Lubman refers to the recent shift in attitudes towards mental health to demonstrate that compassion and enhanced treatment outcomes can be achieved. \u201cOnly 10 or 15 years ago, no one would admit that they had depression. They\u2019d be shunned and judged.\u201d These days, celebrities put their names to mental health conditions, Beyond Blue posters adorn public spaces and GPs are well versed in mental health care plans. \u201cIn recent years, there\u2019s been a public discussion around mental illness and getting people on board to tell their stories and share their lived experience,\u201d Lubman says. \u201cIt normalises these experiences and increases the understanding that it is common, and offers messages of hope.\u201d Crucially, Lubman notes that these messages are missing when we talk about issues with alcohol, drugs or gambling. But those working in the industry see positive changes every day. \u201cWe know that so many people do recover, but we don\u2019t hear those stories. There\u2019s a prevailing and judgmental message of \u2018once an addict, always an addict\u2019. We don\u2019t hear the stories of hope, and we don\u2019t see visible champions of recovery that we see in so many other health areas such as cancer or mental health.\u201d SBS\u2019s groundbreaking new series Addicted Australia puts a human face to these experiences and starts a long overdue conversation by offering a first-hand look into the lives of 10 Australians, who, under the guidance of Lubman and the team at Turning Point, undertake a unique six-month treatment program. The four-part documentary follows their journeys from despair to hope and possible recovery, and provides a deeper understanding of issues around addiction. The hope is that people experiencing addiction can one day be met with compassion, understanding and care. Lubman remains hopeful. \u201cWhat never ceases to amaze me is seeing the obstacles people overcome every day. Meeting people for whom life has thrown a range of challenges, and they\u2019re putting their hand up for help, and working really, really hard for a better life. \u201cThat\u2019s what we don\u2019t see: the fighting spirit and stories of recovery. We only hear, \u2018People chose this life; they don\u2019t deserve our attention or resources\u2019. But the people I see every day \u2026 they give me hope for what is possible.\u201d There are many myths around addiction, including the belief that treatment doesn\u2019t work. SBS\u2019s new series Addicted Australia, which premieres on Tuesday 10 November at 8.30pm, examines why it starts and why it\u2019s hard to stop, and crucially shows hope and the possibility of recovery for everyone.
