Joshua\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, announced the contracted rematch clause was triggered on Tuesday and the second fight will take place in November or December, with a venue still to be confirmed. \u201cAfter meetings with AJ, Rob Mc [Joshua\u2019s trainer Rob McCracken] and the management team in NY, we have today triggered the contracted rematch clause with Andy Ruiz Jnr. The fight will take place in Nov/Dec at a venue to be confirmed shortly,\u201d wrote Hearn in a tweet on Tuesday. The Briton suffered a shock defeat, the first of his career, when he was stopped by Ruiz Jr in the seventh round at Madison Square Garden last weekend. Joshua said shortly after the fight that he had not even been aware there was a rematch clause. \u201cI didn\u2019t even ask about a rematch clause because I was so confident I was going to win,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s there, we\u2019ll go again and I\u2019ll get the titles back. I\u2019m going to beat him up. I\u2019m not dwelling on it. You just correct it, you adjust, you sit down, you focus and you go again.\u201d Hearn said after Saturday\u2019s fight he would want a rematch to take place in the UK, something he reconfirmed to ESPN on Tuesday. \u201cMy gut feeling was the UK but not guaranteed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to look at everything. The people at [broadcaster] DAZN and Madison Square Garden would like to do part two in the US. Joshua came to Andy Ruiz\u2019s country for the first fight so it kind of makes sense to the second fight in the UK. So we\u2019ll see.\u201d However, Ruiz has said his preference would be Mexico, Los Angeles or New York. \u201cI\u2019m the champion \u2026 I call the shots now,\u201d said Ruiz on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
