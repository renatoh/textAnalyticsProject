Eight months ago it seemed that a chronic knee injury meant it was the end of the line for the most productive and talismanic England bowler of the past decade. But how wrong that prediction has proved. How wrong to underestimate someone who lives to bowl, whose raison d'etre is to puff his chest out, sprint in and show the world. He may be one of the game's great spin doctors, talking himself up to a level at which most would not survive without oxygen, and a couple of one-day games is a long way from the rigours of Test cricket, but by golly the team have missed having him around. His knee is standing up so far although it still gives him some discomfort. \"Course it does,\" he said yesterday. \"I'm a fast bowler, I've been doing the job for a long time. But I'm in control of the injury. So I sup port it, ice it after play and strengthen it in the gym. If I didn't do any of that it would hurt a whole lot more.\" As he spoke, the rain was swathing down over Headingley where England are due to play Zimbabwe today. The ground was as drab as ever, the outfield puddled and the forecast sufficiently gloomy to cast doubt on what could yet prove to be his final international performance on his own county ground. Two days previously the sun had been beating down on The Oval as England trounced South Africa by six wickets. It had been a formidable team effort, not least by the pace bowlers, and if it was the young Jimmy Anderson who led the way with the new ball, the old stager had summoned up his experience and given a masterclass in the art of bowling to good players on pristine surfaces. Then came the last over of the innings, the first five balls of which Andrew Hall, through a variety of devices, not all intentional, hit to the boundary, and the last of which brought a single. Twenty-one off the over and a total raised from inadequate to competitive in the space of a few minutes, with bowling figures transported from worthy to indifferent. And as each delivery raced across the outfield, the bowler cupped his chin in his hand and his lips creased into the semblance of a smile. As Oscar Wilde said of the death of Little Nell, you would need a heart of stone not to laugh. He remembers Abdul Razzaq getting hold of him towards the end of an innings in Karachi three years ago but not a final over like this. \"First time it's happened to me, defi nitely,\" he conceded. \"I can't remember being hit like that before. Andrew Hall had a bit of luck but to go for runs like that in the final over was . . . different. The batsman did well and I take my hat off to him. No one in the world hits it like them at the end. But it could have happened to anyone and it just happened that I was bowling. It doesn't worry me.\" Bowling at the death requires skill and nerve. It is cricket's penalty shoot-out. Once upon a time pace alone was good enough. Then, as batsmen became more creative, yorkers were the order of the day. Next, in the 1987 World Cup, came Steve Waugh with his mixture of slower balls. Now, such are the hitting skills at the end, as demonstrated over the weekend not only by Hall but Shaun Pollock and Jacques Kallis as well, that bowlers are having to try to read the batsmen, using intuition and experience and a plethora of tricks. \"I've been doing this a long time,\" said Gough, \"and I'm not bothered by it, but we might have to have a think about it and mix things up.\" In fact, one full toss aside, which was helped on its way to square leg, Gough had bowled a respectable over which deserved better. Two further boundaries to fine leg were involuntary - bowling with the fielder up did not help the cause - and another barely short but with a hint of width was flayed square through the off side. It was the slower ball, cudgelled back over his head, which irked Gough most. \"I bowled one poor ball in the over,\" he said. \"But the one he hit over my head, I stuffed him out of sight. It was his best shot definitely because I'd done him. I saw him coming at me and dragged it wide but he still somehow got it between the two fielders who were back on the fence. But I stuffed him.\" \u00b7 Michael Vaughan hopes to be fit for England's NatWest Series match against Zimbabwe at Headingley after missing Saturday's win over South Africa at The Oval because of a back spasm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
