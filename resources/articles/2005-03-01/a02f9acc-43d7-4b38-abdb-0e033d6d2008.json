Almost invariably owner-run and usually quite small - perhaps only three or four rooms, not likely to be more than 20 - these are the B&amp;Bs, farmhouses, guesthouses and small hotels which offer genuine hospitality, lovely food and real value for money. Kilmaneen Farmhouse,Newcastle, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Kevin and Ber O'Donnell's delightfully situated farmhouse is on a working dairy farm, surrounded by mountains and close to the rivers Suir and Tar, making it an ideal base for walking and fishing holidays. With welcoming fires, good home cooking (BYO wine) and unspoilt countryside, too, this dream place was an obvious choice for the Guide's Farmhouse of the Year Award. How much? B&amp;B \u20ac35pp. Dinner: \u20ac22.50pp. Contact: 00 353 52 36231, kilmaneen.com. Shelburne Lodge, Kenmare, Co Kerry Tom and Maura Foley's fine stone house is the oldest in the gastronomic haven of Kenmare, and the current winner of two awards in the Guide - Guesthouse of the Year and Best Guesthouse Breakfast - which says it all in terms of food and hospitality. Elegant, spacious and supremely comfortable, it's an ideal base for exploring this stunningly beautiful area. How much? B&amp;B \u20ac80pp. Contact: + 64 41013, shelburnelodge@kenmare.com.

Waterside, Graiguenamanagh, Co Kilkenny A characterful small town beautifully located on the River Barrow, Graiguenamanagh is an enchanting place, and Brian and Brigid Roberts' guesthouse and restaurant - a converted stone warehouse on the quay - offers simple but comfortable accommodation, good food and genuine hospitality.
