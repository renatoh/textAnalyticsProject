(Deutsche Grammophon DG 477 5886) \u00a313.99 Hail a London cab this month, and you might find yourself listening to the soothing strains of Bryn Terfel celebrating Mozart's 250th birthday. It's all part of DG's campaign to keep the Welsh maestro high in the charts, both classical and pop, with the eclectic anthologies he keeps producing. It's preferable, of course, to listen to the entire operas; but, for newcomers, few do it better than Bryn, from the lyrical to the bravura, in this sampler of Mozart's biggest hits with the excellent SCO under Charles Mackerras. Vivaldi Griselda Marie-Nicole Lemieux (contralto) &amp; soloists, Ensemble Matheus /Spinosi. (Naive OP 30419) \u00a319.99 From the team that brought you the wonderful, award-winning Orlando Furioso comes the latest instalment in the rarities that make up Naive's priceless Vivaldi edition. This sumptuous world premiere recording, with the Ensemble Matheus under Jean-Christophe Spinosi, finds the sublime Marie-Nicole Lemieux in the title-role written by Vivaldi for his pupil and muse, Anna Giro, dominating every delicious setpiece of the tale (based by Goldoni on Boccaccio) of a humbly born queen who proves herself the moral superior of her imperious husband. Arnold Orchestral works LPO/Handley (LPO 0013) \u00a38.99 For some years principal trumpet of the London Philharmonic, Sir Malcolm Arnold maintained close links with the orchestra throughout his career as a composer. This latest release on the LPO's own label sets the dark sixth symphony and celebratory Philharmonic Concerto alongside perkier pieces such as the jocular overture 'Beckus the Dandipratt ' and a 21st-birthday fanfare for the orchestra - all conducted in 2004 by Vernon Handley. Also released by the LPO this month is Klaus Tennstedt's memorable 1989 recording of Bruckner's fourth symphony, the Romantic (LPO 0014)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
