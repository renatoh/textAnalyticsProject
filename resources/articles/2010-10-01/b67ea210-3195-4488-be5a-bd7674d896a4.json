But nothing is more harmful than when a lot of people are suddenly saying, \"They're all at it, aren't they? Including those guys Bradley Wiggins and Mark Cavendish?\" It was no help last week when the head of the Italian Olympic committee's legal commission on anti-doping, a 78-year-old magistrate called Ettore Torri, chucked a grenade into the room. \"All the riders are taking drugs,\" he announced. \"If it wasn't harmful to their health, maybe it would be better just to legalise it.\" Inside Italy the storm of denial was immediate and predictable. But so much mud has been thrown at cycling in recent years that few, even among those who admired Contador's three Tour de France victories in the past four years, following a recovery from radical brain surgery in 2004, are inclined to swallow his protestations. Many who listened to his story about a friend arriving at the Tour with a piece of \"good meat\", which he ate the night before giving the sample, wished that he had said nothing at all, at least in public. It was inevitable that the minds of those who follow cycling would go back to the Operaci\u00f3n Puerto investigation of 2006, in which Spanish police looked into the affairs of Dr Eufemiano Fuentes, a former medical consultant with various teams. Among the 100 bags of blood found in Fuentes's clinic, and believed to belong to athletes involved in doping, was one marked with the initials \"AC\". Contador had been a member of the ONCE and Liberty Seguros teams, with whom Fuentes had worked. Several leading riders were suspended as a result of Operaci\u00f3n Puerto, but Contador was cleared. In 2007 he won his first Tour in the jersey of Discovery Channel, Lance Armstrong's team, and the following year he switched to Astana, the Kazakh-funded squad which had risen from the ashes of Liberty Seguros and whose riders were barred from the 2008 Tour because of doping infringements by several of them during the previous season. His second and third Tours were won in Astana's colours, but immediately after this year's success he announced his intention to join Saxo-Bank, a team owned and managed by Bjarne Riis, the Dane whose victory in the 1996 Tour is marked by an asterisk following his admission in 2007 that he had used EPO. If Contador has been trying to distance himself from doping and dopers, he has not been doing a very good job. So why is one prepared to defend the reputations of Wiggins and Cavendish? There is a simple answer to this: because they lose. Wiggins finished a remarkable fourth in the 2009 Tour de France, thanks to a dogged performance in the mountains made possible by a severe training programme. No one had been expecting such a performance, and there were mutterings of suspicion, particularly in France. This year, however, with the amply-funded new Team Sky squarely behind him, Wiggins disappointed. It was true that the 2010 course, with its sharper climbs, did not suit him so well, but had he been systematically doping he would still surely have finished higher than 24th. Cavendish's story is a little different. After an unscheduled bout of serious dental surgery had destroyed his pre-season training schedule, the Manx sprinter came back to win five stages of the Tour de France and the green jersey in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. But then came two events that also mean a lot to him: the world championship in Melbourne, which he failed to finish, and Sunday's Commonwealth Games road race in Delhi, where he proudly represented the Isle of Man but traipsed in a well-beaten seventh. A rider with a sophisticated doping programme, or even a crude one, would be unlikely to have failed so badly. In this particularly area of sport, claims of innocence can be made to look stupid very quickly. But it's still worth saying: in cycling, by their defeats ye shall know them. Blanc twists and Payet gives Romania stick After the trauma of the World Cup, France may be on their way back \u2013 at least to judge by two late goals against Romania on Saturday night with which they avoided a goalless draw that would surely have led to another departure from the Stade de France amid a hail of whistling. In the closing stages Laurent Blanc made a flurry of changes, and they paid off. Two of his substitutes, Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my and Yoann Gourcuff, scored the goals, in the 80th and 93rd minutes, but it was the contribution of the third, Dimitri Payet, that caught the eye. A 23-year-old R\u00e9union-born forward who plays for St-Etienne, Payet marked his debut with a couple of fast, direct runs, the second of which created the opening for Gourcuff's strike. He looked a hot property. Secretariat movie would strike a chord with Gaye Marvin Gaye once compared himself to Secretariat, the great stallion who won the US Triple Crown in 1973. If a fine horse throws riders and has trouble getting into the starting gate, Gaye told me a couple of years before his death in 1984, who cares as long as it wins the race? \"I'm nervous and highly strung,\" he added. \"Apparently it goes with my talent.\" A Hollywood film telling Secretariat's story has just opened in the US, depicting a special relationship between the stallion and his owner, Peggy Chenery. The lady herself, who is now in her late 80s, downplays it. \"We had a mutual respect,\" she told the New York Times, \"but he didn't stand still long enough for me to look in his eye and say a prayer.\" Which is probably what Berry Gordy Jr, the founder of Motown Records, would have said about Gaye, his brilliant, headstrong protege. Note to self: mind what you say about McClaren Look, I never said I thought Steve McClaren should be the next manager of England, OK? I just pointed out that his recent achievements abroad would, if maintained, undoubtedly place him among the most plausible English candidates to succeed Fabio Capello. So then Sir Trevor Brooking is asked whether the FA would entertain the idea, and Brooking doesn't say no, and the next thing that happens is that McClaren is letting it be known that he would not even consider the idea. Memo to self: be more careful the next time you open your mouth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
