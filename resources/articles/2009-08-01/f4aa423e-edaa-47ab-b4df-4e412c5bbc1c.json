Lennon's line, \"nobody told me there'd be days like these\", must be drifting from his inner jukebox as England's lone centurion confronts a daunting task sheet. Called to clear up the gore from Kevin Pietersen's failed coup d'\u00e9tat against Peter Moores and his coaching staff back in early January, Strauss said: \"Clearly the circumstances are less than ideal, in some ways.\" This was the euphemistic, fire-dousing summation of the selfless solid citizen. Should England fall short of the victory they require to regain the urn from an Australia side with a disappointingly low problem count, this could end up as Strauss's epitaph. \"His circumstances were less than ideal, in some ways, but he always gave his best.\" A fortnight after the Headingley implosion it falls to him to steer Jonathan Trott through the most onerous Test debut in memory, stop the Flintoff swan song distorting England's tactics and cleanse their heads of the thought that Leeds was a crash from which there can be no way back. A heavy load. \"It is, but captaining England always is, and it's probably been that way all the way through the series,\" Strauss said after nets at The Oval. \"I like that responsibility, I think it helps my cricket and I'm also very aware that my number one job is to go out there at the start of the innings and set a platform for the rest. I'm as determined as anyone to go out and get a big score this week.\" Leadership by deed, not by rhetoric. Strauss can see that his best pep talk would be a flurry of runs from the top of the order on opening day. Captaining England comes with its own special convoy of uncontrollable incidents \u2013 the wicketkeeper's back going in the warm-up, or Kevin Pietersen's achilles packing up at Lord's \u2013 but the bat in the hand is a reliable instrument of destiny, hence the captain's extra net session at lunchtime, when the rest of the team had melted from the scene. Whether deputising for an injured Michael Vaughan, sponging Pietersen's professional blood off the pavilion walls, or endeavouring to correct the aberrations that brought down his bowling attack in Leeds, Strauss has been the clean-up artist of English cricket. His runs have bailed out an underperforming middle-order, now rejigged to include the virgin, Trott. Not only is the captain the only England batsman to have made a hundred (161, at Lord's) this summer, his 344 runs put daylight between him and his nearest pursuer, Matt Prior, who has 239. As Australia's most wanted, Strauss is averaging a fraction less than 50 (49.14), though his scores at Headingley (three and 32) raise the heat on him to reprise his first-innings 129 in the series-clinching Oval finale of four years ago. By comparison, Ricky Ponting is in a dilemma-free paradise. Perky and pugnacious, as ever, Australia's captain turned down the invitation to sympathise with his counterpart on the eve of what Strauss calls a \"perfect storm\" of a match. \"Yeah, it's fair to say he's got a few more things on his plate than we have. But as we know, in this game of Test cricket things can change pretty quickly,\" Ponting said. \"It's only a couple of weeks since I was sitting here answering those sorts of questions. \"If you look back to the start of the first Test there have been very few instances when we've played really poor cricket. Most of the games we've played we've had some really dominating periods in them. That's what we need to do again this week. We need to keep England under pressure, and then some of the things Andrew is having to think about will raise their heads.\" Strauss's quiet gallantry and home counties equanimity conceal the scale of his influence over the past four years. Few now talk about his role in 2005, when he was the only batsman on either side to score two centuries, and snaffled a slip catch that became a national work of art. On England's calamitous tour as Ashes holders, in 2006-07, he fell under the wheels of the Flintoff celebrity juggernaut and was passed over as captain, only to be recalled when two billboard leaders, Flintoff and Pietersen, flamed out in a job for which both were ill-suited. Strauss said: \"The Ashes were the last thing on my mind when I took over. There were plenty of other things going on at the time.\" Since then he has had to deal with the Flintoff no-show for the England bus ride to First World War graves at Ypres, and a pointed suggestion from the all-rounder's agent that his client was fit to play at Headingley but \"not wanted\" by Strauss and Andy Flower. \"To restore unity\" was Strauss's mission at the outset, this winter. This must have strained his patience many times since, given the sporadic self-destructive tendencies of this generation of England cricketers. \"An Ashes series is an honour and a privilege and you get your highest moments in an Ashes series, but when things don't go well it's a tough series to play in and it asks a lot of questions about your temperament and your character,\" Strauss said. Today he is required to be an enforcer, thinker, strategist, mentor to the inexperienced and star batsman. \"His weakness is probably his conservative approach. He will tend to take the safer option in most cases,\" Justin Langer wrote in his scouting email to Australia's coach, Tim Nielsen. But the part that really chimed was the former Test opener's description of Strauss as \"a very solid character and a good bloke\". It happens this way: sometimes a player is defined less by his own achievements than his ability to solve problems that were of somebody else's making."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
