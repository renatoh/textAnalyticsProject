On the evidence of what turned into a comprehensive wrecking in this EDF Cup pool game, as well as their own admission afterwards, Wasps lacked the nous on the road and duly paid the price. Shaun Edwards needed only three words to describe his side's difficulties with the way the referee, Nigel Owens, dealt with the breakdowns on Saturday compared with what Wasps are used to in the Premiership: \"Two different games\". Their director of rugby, Ian McGeechan, was more expansive but no less annoyed. \"If you can't control the tackle area, it's a very difficult game,\" he said. \"There was no real flow during the second half. I should have told the players to play off their feet and challenge the referee in the same way. I was too slow.\" However Owens' management of the action is viewed, though, the game confirmed the rude health of Tom Shanklin, perhaps the biggest loss of the many absentees with injury during Wales's disappointing Six Nations campaign this spring, and now clearly over his knee problems. Although he had not trained all week as he recovered from bruising sustained in the previous Friday's win over Glasgow, Shanklin was at the heart of much of Cardiff's best rugby. Talk of Gareth Thomas returning from Toulouse continues, although the Blues' director of rugby, Dai Young, was keen to play it down, but with Shanklin in this form Thomas would just be the icing on the cake. Like the dynamic and ubiquitous Martyn Williams, the centre has the capacity to galvanise play at any second. Purists would have savoured the way he created the gap that made Cardiff's third and best try for Mosese Luveitasau, while Fraser Waters will not forget one challenge late on that left him halfway to Bridgend. Cardiff bristled with intent and there was menace in a backline marshalled by Nicky Robinson and Ben Blair. \"We're starting to get mental toughness and self-belief,\" said Young.
