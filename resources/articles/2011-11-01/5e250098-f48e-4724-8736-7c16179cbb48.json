He's like a puppy \u2013 playful and idiotic, with a lovely repertoire of facial expressions and whimpering noises. Totally irresistible and adorable. Adoring too \u2013 he worships Her (Becky). When he says: \"This might be the best day of my entire life\" because she's moved in with him, he really means it. And he wants a blow job. 2 Her Becky, played by Sarah Solemani, is lovely \u2013 beautiful, sexy, funny \u2026 that's not a bad combo to start with. But she's also wise, certainly wiser than Steve is (though, to be fair, so is a peanut). And kind too. They both are \u2013 to each other, and to other people. Kind, but not worthy or pious. It's perfect. Becky is also mischievous and shares Steve's slovenliness. Plus she's a bit dirty. In short, perfect. 3 Him &amp; Her They're perfect together too. They fit. Traditionally, a sitcom couple are competitive and bickery. Steve and Becky are very much in love, which is both refreshing and incredibly sweet. And all over each other. If they weren't so nice, it would be easy to be jealous. Every couple should try to be more like Steve and Becky. 4 What they say The traditional sitcom couple exchange salvos of smart-arse lines, each of which is followed by an aftershock of audience laughter. It has little to do with the way people actually speak. Golaszewski's script does. \"Come on, don't be a dick,\" Steve says to Becky when she won't lick the blood from a scratch (or is it a spot?) on his arm. That's what goes on and gets said in real bedrooms. Doesn't it? 5 What they say (part 2) That's not to say there aren't plenty of laugh-out-loud funny lines. Mostly delivered by Laura (see below). Such as: \"Nice to give something back to animals after all they've done for us \u2013 you know, pulling stuff, guarding things, making honey; you could write a book about it.\" Or: \"God she's hot, Becks, she's like something out of Nuts.\" 6 Dan The neighbour. He's everything that Steve and Becky aren't \u2013 beardy, weirdy, inappropriate, awkward, unaware, socially inept \u2026 though not entirely unlikable; it's just that there are issues. Everyone knows a Dan, don't they? A brilliant character, and a brilliant performance from Joe Wilkinson. \"Would you do 'er?\" he asks Steve, showing him a picture of his girlfriend. 7 Laura and Paul You can't be liking everyone. Which is where Laura and Paul come in. Laura may be Becky's sister, but she's nothing like her. She's ambitious and mean, cruel even; certainly pretentious and ridiculous (\"chaise longue\" rhymes with blancmange when she says it). Though, as I said, she does have the best lines. Paul, her fiance, is just a nasty thug. Both are horrid, and hilarious. 8 The little things Steve drinks tea from a measuring jug, presumably because a mug would involve washing up. Or there is only one mug? The place is a tip, and yet he has an OCD thing going on about all the hangers having to face the same way in the wardrobe \u2013 hooking inwards, obviously, because then they're easier to get out. He's right, I have that! Anyway, what I'm saying is that it's beautifully observed. 9 The loo door Generally open. For wees, and possibly more. So it's a bit disgusting, and probably quite smelly, but there's something refreshingly unuptight and open about it, reflecting Steve and Becky's relaxed relationship. First thing I'm going to do when I get home tonight: take that bathroom door right off, in an attempt to be more like them. Could be interesting when the rellies come over. 10 Hmmm \u2026 Can't think of another. A summing-up then for number 10. Him &amp; Her rings true, it's funny, sexy, a wee bit rude, and utterly charming. It may also be the nicest thing on the telly right now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
