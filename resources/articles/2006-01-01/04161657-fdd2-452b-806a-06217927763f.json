Sky will use Windows Media Center to deliver its forthcoming Sky By Broadband service, which will enable 8 million Sky subscribers in the UK to access video via their PCs. Movies and sports will be delivered through the MCE's Online Spotlight portal, which already offers movies and sports content, music on demand, news and games. Video will be delivered in Windows Media Video 9 format to Windows Media Player10. The digital rights management (DRM) system will let people watch the movies they download for up to 30 days. In October, Sky bought Easynet for \u00a3211 million, to enable it to offer \"triple-play\" services -- broadband internet, television and telephony. Sky is also planning a Sky By Mobile service."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
