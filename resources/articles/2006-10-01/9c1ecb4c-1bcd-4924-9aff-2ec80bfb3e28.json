If you're getting rid of an old jacket with patches on the elbows, heave it over to Lewisham College, which has stumbled on an intriguing phenomenon. Its business students appear unable to turn up to lectures on time, but youngsters pursuing construction or nails and beauty are impeccably punctual. Some shrewd old salt wondered whether the fact that the latter students are given the right kit to wear had anything to do with the difference. Suits were bought for some business students and their timekeeping has improved dramatically ever since. The college is now looking for a sponsor to kit out the rest of the business course. But why should their teachers be left out? They too perform much better in the proper uniform. So if you have an old jacket ... \u00b7 One in five people spend nothing at all on their brains, declares a mystifying Learning and Skills Council press release. Presumably these umpteen million people are either not eating or are lucky enough to be fed for nothing. A third of the population takes no exercise to stimulate their brains, this curious communique continues. But why is the quango whittering on like this? \"Further education can provide the route to structured learning, and offers a huge choice of courses,\" the puff concludes. Ah. At last, someone is getting a bit anxious about the decline in evening-class numbers. \u00b7 Luckily, there is enough left in the quango's \u00a39bn kitty to fly 20 young entrepreneurs to the United States. An outfit called Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, is laying on a two-week programme, teaching entrepreneurship to the young Britons, who are all running their own businesses. It's part of something called the New Entrepreneur Scholarships programme, which is funded by the LSC. But best not say any more lest any curmudgeonly students who have lost their evening classes make some totally unwarranted connections. \u00b7 More than 1.7 million people have had to take days off to recover from their summer holidays, according to data published by the Benenden Healthcare organisation. By far the most common culprits are aged between 16 and 24 - 13% of this age group take extra leave. With touching naivety, the data's compilers suggest that this is due to injuries sustained on adventure holidays."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
