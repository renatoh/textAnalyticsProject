It is like the X Games edition of Saturday Night Takeaway. It comes on the back of another new Netflix show, Flinch, in which Seann Walsh and friends fire paintballs at contestants\u2019 heads, or jab rancid meat in their faces. What is striking about these two shows, though, isn\u2019t so much the casual sadism, as the fact that they are less sadistic than those we would have been offered in years gone by. Spending 24 hours without sleep is Guant\u00e1namo-lite, compared with, say, Channel 5\u2019s 2001 gameshow Touch the Truck, in which contestants had to cling on to a vehicle at a shopping mall in Thurrock, Essex, for days on end, the last one still in contact taking it home. Some hallucinated. Others cried. Ratings were so-so. If Flinch sounds like a dive into the psychology of self-loathing, it has nothing on the US gameshow Fear Factor, which originally aired in 2001. The very first episode went straight to Room 101, with contestants strapped down at the bottom of a pit of peckish rats. Revenge of sorts arrived in season two, when contestants ate liquefied rat. Joe Rogan, the show\u2019s host and now a popular podcaster, recalled a moment of clarity about how easy it was to get people to debase themselves after he watched a woman drink a pint of donkey semen, the sort of grotesque task later made routine in I\u2019m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. For decades, people have yearned for early evening entertainment that casually demeans others. In the early 80s, Three\u2019s a Crowd quizzed men\u2019s wives and secretaries to find out which knew more about them. It offered, said the critic David Hofstede, \u201cthe chance to watch a marriage dissolve on camera years before Jerry Springer\u201d. But after Touch the Truck, we entered a new era in which \u201cgroundbreaking TV experiment\u201d became the new catchphrase for mass debasement. As recently as 2015, the US network TLC was punting Labor Games, in which women in the throes of giving birth answered questions about baby formula to win such prizes as a year\u2019s tuition. In 2014, I Wanna Marry Harry gave us the sight of American women \u2013 who seemed to have been selected by binning the forms of anyone north of 100 on the IQ scale \u2013 trying to win the hand of a man who had been sold to them as Prince Harry. Whether it is Fatima Whitbread snorting a cockroach, or the Total Wipeout staple where a contestant drops, groin-first, on to a padded bollard, we all love a bit of casual sadism. That impulse is taken to tacky places by the telly, but it is not one we can immediately discard, because it is only when someone is up against the extremes of discomfort that we find out who they truly are. Watching Gillian McKeith floundering in a crayfish tank instantly confirmed everything we had always suspected about her, while watching Ferne McCann eat a live spider with transcendent grace illustrated a spirit far beyond her Towie roots. But it seems that the days of unexamined sadism may be drawing to a close. As we police each other ever-more stringently on social media in our new \u201cduty of care\u201d era, TV is moving the lawyers further and further up the chain of command. The problem for modern TV companies is that when they come for you, you don\u2019t want to be seen to be the only sadist in the room. It is not a coincidence that I\u2019m a Celebrity has always made the public complicit by getting them to vote for what happens next. We are the bullies who root for our victims: the perfect modern way to have our cake and eat it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
