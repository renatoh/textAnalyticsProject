This week the international credit crunch comes home to benlagenlive in the form of a sternly worded letter from my ISP regarding a \"recurring billing failure\". I've posted a pdf on the site so that you can see this direct threat to free speech for yourselves. The impact of the financial crisis on citizen journalism has also resulted in the sudden departure of my IT guru Wayne, who is citing \"creative differences\" over on his new site Wayne'sWorld (sorry, no link. Trust me, you're not missing anything). Let's just say that the \"differences\" were over some of the more \"creative\" bits of Wayne's last few invoices. Nevertheless a brief video tribute to Wayne's contribution to benlagenlive will remain in its prominent place on the home page until I can figure out how to take it down. Unfortunately a recent downturn in ad sales has forced me to look into other, more radical revenue streams, including direct funding from site visitors. I need a new iPhone battery desperately. My old one died in the middle of the Tory party conference, and I've got a picture of Lord Strathclyde with food on his face that I now can't upload. With my iPhone out of action I've had to go even more hyperlocal than usual this week, relying on the webcam that's built in to my laptop. I've done some interviews with ordinary people, the proverbial \"man on the Clapham omnibus\", about the effects of the credit crunch. Originally I planned to do it on a bus in Clapham, but then I realised it's not a very good place to take your laptop out. So I did it in Starbucks, where I know everybody, and they have free Wi-Fi as long as you buy something. Another bill. The top 3 most visited stories for the week ending 27.09.08 were: 1. Wayne: an appreciation (123) 2. Lagen On: Loggin' on - yes, we're having technical problems AGAIN (14) 3. Tory conference diary: tales from the food court (1) See you next week, God willing.
