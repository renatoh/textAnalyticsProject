The prime minister promised activists in Birmingham that he would get Brexit completed within weeks and spend next year focusing on the NHS, schools and other priorities, as he tried to draw a line under a disastrous few days for the Conservatives. He attempted to reposition himself as leader of a \u201cmoderate, one nation Conservative\u201d government. However, his campaign has already been overshadowed by a series of damaging blunders in recent days. His ally, Jacob Rees-Mogg, suggested that victims of the Grenfell Tower fire lacked common sense; and Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, resigned over his knowledge of a former aide\u2019s role in allegedly sabotaging a rape trial. Johnson is now facing calls to remove Cairns as a Conservative candidate, with the furore threatening to derail the Tory campaign in Wales. The cabinet crisis erupted just as Johnson went to Buckingham Palace to discuss the dissolution of parliament with the Queen. He later gave a speech on the steps of Downing Street insisting he had not wanted an election \u2013 and claiming he was \u201cchewing my own tie\u201d with frustration that Brexit had not yet happened. Later, in Birmingham, Johnson was flanked by his remaining cabinet and arrived to chants of \u201cBoris, Boris\u201d, shortly after a group of anti-racism campaigners were manhandled away from the venue by security. He focused his speech on his intention to pass his \u201coven-ready\u201d Brexit deal through parliament quickly if he gets a majority and promised a year of \u201cgrowth and prosperity\u201d. But Johnson also launched a personal attack on Corbyn, claiming he was a proponent of \u201cBolivarian socialism\u201d who would pursue a \u201cderanged\u201d programme of nationalisation and bring in higher taxes on \u201cpensions, corporations, inheritance, homes, gardens\u201d. The Labour manifesto has not yet been published and the party has said tax rises would focus on the very wealthy and companies. He also said Corbyn wanted to have totally unlimited immigration, even though the party has not unveiled its policy in this area yet, and wanted to \u201cexpropriate\u201d the assets of schools \u2013 referring to a motion at party conference that called for the assets of private schools to be redistributed. This is unlikely to make it into the party\u2019s manifesto. Johnson did not attack Farage, who is popular with many Brexiters, by name but said those who \u201ccast aspersions\u201d on the deal with the EU have a vested interest in Brexit not happening. \u201cThey are like candle-makers at the dawn of the electric lightbulb,\u201d he said, adding that there was a \u201cterrible sense they are about to lose their market\u201d. Johnson moved to criticise Farage after the Brexit party leader refused to stand down candidates \u2013 despite pleas from pro-leave Tories that by doing so he could prevent a split in the Brexit vote. Farage\u2019s party is still taking a substantial chunk of leave support, which Johnson would need to eat into if he has a chance of winning a majority. The Conservatives remain ahead in the polls but it is not clear yet if events of the last few days will have affected their chances. The party\u2019s troubles with the Welsh Conservatives are particularly serious for Johnson as the Tories would need to make inroads in leave-voting areas of the country to win the election outright. Cairns sent a letter to Johnson on Wednesday saying he was confident he would be cleared by any investigation into his behaviour, but he was stepping down because it was such a \u201csensitive matter\u201d. Johnson thanked Cairns for his role in abolishing toll charges on the Severn Bridge and his \u201cunstinting record of service for the party in Wales\u201d. However, Corbyn said the prime minister should prevent Cairns from standing again to be an MP. \u201cFirst of all, there\u2019s a victim here,\u201d he told broadcasters after a speech in Telford. \u201cThat victim needs to be apologised to and needs to be supported. \u201cSecondly, if he\u2019s resigning because of his behaviour and involvement in this as the secretary of state, then shouldn\u2019t he also be resigning as a Conservative party candidate in the election? That\u2019s my question. \u201cObviously, legally he can stand as a candidate, but does he have a moral right to stand as a candidate? If he\u2019s stepping down as a minister because of his involvement then I would have thought the very least the Conservative party can do is not put him up as a candidate in the next election.\u201d Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and a former director of public prosecutions, said: \u201cHe is right to resign but he has got to face an investigation. This is a very, very serious issue. It goes well beyond a ministerial investigation. Resigning was right to do, but it is not enough on its own.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
