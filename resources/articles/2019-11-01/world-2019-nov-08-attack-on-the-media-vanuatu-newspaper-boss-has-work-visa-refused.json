After 16 years in Vanuatu, McGarry\u2019s application to renew his work permit was refused on Thursday, meaning that McGarry, whose spouse and children are from the country, will have to leave Vanuatu. McGarry, who is Canadian, said he believed he was being forced out because of the paper\u2019s critical coverage of the government and accused the government of misusing administrative processes for political means. McGarry said in a statement that the \u201covert reason\u201d his visa had been refused was that his position should have been \u201clocalised\u201d \u2013 filled by someone from Vanuatu \u2013 by now, adding: \u201cBut we all know the real reason: the Daily Post reporting on the government\u2019s activities caused such discomfort that they are willing to abuse administrative processes to silence me.\u201d \u201cIn July the prime minister summoned me and berated me for my \u2018negative\u2019 reporting. \u2018If you don\u2019t like it here\u2019, he told me, \u2018go home\u2019. But Vanuatu is my home.\u201d McGarry said he had met with Daily Post executives and was lodging an appeal against the decision. He told Guardian Australia there was nothing unusual about his application and had expected it to be approved \u2013 as one was for a Fijian employee just two months ago. \u201cOur contention is that this is an illegitimate process,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a straight up attack on the media.\u201d \u201cThe rejection to me was copied to the minister of internal affairs. He has no business being involved in any of these decisions. So why is he being copied if he\u2019s not been part of the process from the beginning?\u201d The Vanuatu government has been contacted for comment. In July the Daily Post broke the story of Vanuatu deporting six Chinese nationals \u2013 four of whom had obtained Vanuatu citizenship \u2013 without due process or access to legal counsel. \u201cUnder a veil of secrecy, China has convinced Vanuatu to enforce Chinese law within its own borders,\u201d the story opened. McGarry said he was \u201cquite confident\u201d it was that series of reports which had upset the government. McGarry has lived in Vanuatu for 16 years, taking the role of media director in 2015 after the paper\u2019s founder, Marc Neil-Jones, stepped down. \u201cMy predecessor was assaulted three times, deported once, and imprisoned once, for doing the exact same job I\u2019m doing,\u201d McGarry said. \u201cWe pulled through that adversity. I took the job knowing what I might be facing \u2026 because I knew it was important.\u201d He said while he was confident about the appeal against the work permit refusal, it had been tough. \u201cIt\u2019s my life. This is everything; it\u2019s all I care about. I spent last night dealing with my partner of six years who was in tears. She doesn\u2019t know how I\u2019ll be able to help provide for the family. My children know there\u2019s something wrong.\u201d The Media Association of Vanuatu said it was saddened by the actions of the government, which it said did not use other available options to \u201cdeal with its grievances\u201d over Daily Post articles. \u201cMAV maintains that silencing the media and journalists will only affect the good relationship media has with this government,\u201d it said. \u201cThe relationship is at a level never before experienced by [the] media industry. MAV is therefore asking the honourable prime minister to ensure Mr Dan McGarry has the liberty to pursue all the legal process available to him in order to have his valid documents organised.\u201d Australia\u2019s journalism union, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, described the incident as \u201ca disturbing development that raises concerns over press freedom and the public\u2019s right to know in Vanuatu\u201d. Responding to a Facebook post by McGarry, Vanuatu\u2019s minister for youth and sport, Francois Chani, said he hoped the prime minister would reconsider."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
