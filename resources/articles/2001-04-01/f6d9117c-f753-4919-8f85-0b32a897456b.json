This is the story of a man who goes to bed and, quite literally, loses his head. What follows is a waking nightmare of horror and beauty as physical theatre blurs into circus, dreams merge into reality, and a suit turns into pyjamas. Wardrobes play host to the fantastic, and even paintings take on a life of their own, \u00e0 la Harry Potter. The show is physically inventive, its mix of opera and jazz is full of musical cheek, and it is never just about doing tricks, although the cast of four take the trapeze, acrobatics, contortion and juggling all in their stride. What's so good about this piece is that it takes the circus beyond the mere act. When the man bounces in and out of his armchair it is not just a clever piece of acrobatics but a physical manifestation of his inner turmoil and frustration. A beautiful sequence of swinging on a candelabra captures absolutely the feeling of what sex is like in a dream. Most of all, the show has the Alice-in-Wonderland logic of a dream. Arms and legs grow out of plant pots, it is possible to have a fight with your mirror image, the tableware at a feast suddenly turns into the armour for an armadillo and a chicken, and peacock feathers suddenly become a shower of arrows. The evening is about transformations, and it makes you see the world just a little bit differently, as if through the eyes of a surrealist. One of the wonders of this show is that only four people are involved. This may be small-scale circus, but there are no limits to its imagination and it owes as much to the art gallery and the theatre as it does to the big top. If you want to see how circus is beginning to grow up as an art form, this is the show for you - and the kids will thrill to it too. The only shame is that the run is such a short one, as this show definitely deserves to be seen. \u0095 Ends tonight. Box office: 020-7960 4242."}, "isHosted": false}}}
