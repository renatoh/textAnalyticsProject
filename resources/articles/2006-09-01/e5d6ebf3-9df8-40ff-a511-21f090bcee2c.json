Unfortunately for Mr Cameron, his desire for the UK to remain in the European Union means that our trade policy is dictated from Brussels by Peter Mandelson, and any trade negotiations will exclude the British government. Countries such as India and other booming economies should be embraced by Britain as trading partners as a means to increasing global wealth. But until we control our own trade policy, this will not be possible. Nigel Farage MEP UK Independence party David Cameron is right to point out that India has the second largest economy in the Commonwealth. But there has never been an Indian secretary general and India's contribution to the small secretariat budget is barely a 10th of the UK's. Next year in Uganda, Commonwealth leaders are due to pick only the fifth secretary general since 1965. South Asian candidates were beaten in the last two competitive elections. I greatly hope that the region can combine to put forward a person of distinction this time, running on a programme for the renewal of purposes and budgets. The UK should support such a candidate.
