Matthew Engel was at Taunton ... That\u2019s it for today\u2019s blog. Thanks for your emails and company during a really enjoyable match. I\u2019ll leave you with our match report from Taunton. Tomorrow it\u2019s India v New Zealand v the weather at Trent Bridge. Bye! Australia\u2019s win takes them to second in the table. Here are the latest standings Here\u2019s the Australia captain Aaron Finch \u201cIt\u2019s always tough with guys like Hassan and Wahab \u2013 they are good strikers of the ball and when they get on a roll they can be hard to stop. It was really disappointing that we didn\u2019t bat out our 50 overs. We probably tried to go too hard too early, but that happens and it\u2019s great that we still got the two points. It was a tough call to leave Zamps out \u2013 when you lose your allrounder you have to choose an extra bowler or an extra batter; you can\u2019t have both.\u201d Here\u2019s the Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed. We lost three wickets in 15 balls [in the middle order] and that\u2019s why we lost the match. We conceded too many runs at the start of the innings \u2013 except Amir, the other bowlers did not bowl well with the new ball. After 20 overs we came back really hard. For me this was a 270-280 pitch. We will try our best against India.\u201d A bit of England news The Man of the Match is David Warner, who scored his first ODI century since you-know-when \u201cI wanted to bat the whole innings but credit to the way Pakistan bowled \u2013 their second spells were fantastic. It was a used wicket against India and a tad dry, and they bowled very straight lines and gave me no width. I had to adapt today. I had to be tighter at the start of the innings because there was a bit of movement, so I tried to be patient and climb into anything short. Our bowlers were fantastic. It was probably closer than we expected with Wahab freeing his arms at the end, but it was a great game.\u201d That was a memorable, melodramatic game of cricket. Australia still aren\u2019t at their best, but most of their star players delivered and they held their nerve on a couple of occasions when Pakistan threatened to embarrass them. Pakistan? They played brilliantly, abysmally, sublimely, ridiculously, life-affirmingly and spirit-crushingly. They almost won despite an absurd middle-order collapse; they lost despite inducing a dramatic Australian collapse. Pakistan 266 all out (Sarfaraz run out 40) That\u2019s it! Maxwell runs out the non-striker Sarfaraz with a brilliant piece of fielding, and Australia have won a superb match by 41 runs. 45th over: Pakistan 266-9 (Sarfaraz 40, Shaheen 1) Shaheen Afridi is a proper No11, so this should not take long. It\u2019s been a brilliant match which has see-sawed wildly. Mitchell Starc has done it again! Amir drags a low full toss back onto the stumps, and Australia are one wicket away from another hard-fought victory in this tournament. It was a lovely delivery from Starc, seaming away from around the wicket. Wahab followed it and seemed to connect only with fresh air, but Carey went up for caught behind and eventually persuaded a reluctant Finch to review. There was no noise or deviation - but there was a little spike on UltraEdge and that was enough to end a fine knock from Wahab. He\u2019s out! Finch was reluctant and only decided to do so with a second remaining. 44th over: Pakistan 263-7 (Sarfaraz 39, Wahab 45) If this goes the distance Australia will need to find one over from Maxwell or Finch. For now, Richardson returns to the attack in place of Coulter-Nile and concedes six \u2013 one two and four singles. Sarfaraz is playing a fascinating innings: he\u2019s hit only one boundary but has scored 38 from 45, and in the last few overs it feels like he\u2019s taken a single off every delivery. 43rd over: Pakistan 257-7 (Sarfaraz 37, Wahab 41) Mickey Arthur, the world\u2019s worst poker player, is pacing on the spot on the Pakistan balcony. I\u2019d pay to watch him during a tight Pakistan game, never mind the match itself. Starc returns to the attack in an attempt to end the nonsense. He doesn\u2019t manage that but it\u2019s a good over nonetheless, with three from it. Pakistan will try to get most of their runs off the other bowlers; they need 51 from 42 balls. 42nd over: Pakistan 254-7 (Sarfaraz 36, Wahab 39) Pakistan\u2019s tactics are pretty counterintuitive, with the specialist batsman (Sarfaraz) taking singles to get the lower-order hitters (Hassan, Wahab) on strike. But you can understand the logic, and it\u2019s certainly working at the moment \u2013 Wahab has just swiped Coulter-Nile\u2019s slower ball over the leg side for six more! Wahab Riaz owes Australia one from the last World Cup, and he has sped to 39 from 30 balls. Pakistan need 54 from 48. 41st over: Pakistan 244-7 (Sarfaraz 34, Wahab 31) With two fifth-bowler overs still to be bowled, Glenn Maxwell returns to the attack. Pakistan have no choice but to take him on \u2013 and they do just that, with 14 runs from the over! Wahab had a vile heave at the first delivery, inside-edging it this far wide of off stump, before driving the second sweetly over long-on for six. Coulter-Nile then saved three runs with a quick-witted bit of fielding on the midwicket boundary. 40th over: Pakistan 230-7 (Sarfaraz 32, Wahab 19) Cummins concedes just two from his final over, completing an admirable spell of 10-0-33-3. Pakistan need 78 from the last 10 overs. 39th over: Pakistan 228-7 (Sarfaraz 31, Wahab 18) Coulter-Nile replaces Starc, and Sarfaraz continues to deal almost exclusively in singles. He\u2019s either trying to take the game deep in the hope that the madness takes over, or he is mindful of net run-rate. Wahab, it\u2019s fair to say, still thinks this game can be won, and he flogs Coulter-Nile over midwicket for six to demonstrate that point. 38th over: Pakistan 217-7 (Sarfaraz 29, Wahab 9) Pat Cummins is such a champion. He would take on a Sisyphean task without complaint, and he is still charging in here looking for a fourth wicket. Sarfaraz almost drags on, not once but twice, and there are only three runs from the over. It\u2019s slipping away from Pakistan, who need 91 from 72 balls. 37th over: Pakistan 214-7 (Sarfaraz 27, Wahab 8) This is Starc\u2019s seventh over, so Finch has some insurance if the game does go deep. An edge from Wahab flashes past the diving Smith at slip and away for four. 36th over: Pakistan 207-7 (Sarfaraz 25, Wahab 3) Cummins has also returned to the attack, so Aaron Finch is going in for the kill. Nothing doing in that over, which yields a couple of runs for Pakistan. 35th over: Pakistan 205-7 (Sarfaraz 24, Wahab 2) Sarfaraz will need to play the innings of his life for Pakistan to win this. Starc returns to the attack and produces a nasty bouncer that Wahab does well to work for a single. Five from the over. Pakistan need 103 from 90 balls. \u201cNot sure whether you\u2019d call Hasan Ali a floating pinch-hitter or whether he was always coming in at No8, but I recently argued the case for throwing a floater into a floundering run chase (as opposed to using them in positions of strength when setting a total, which is a tactical no-brainer),\u201d writes Scott Oliver. \u201cOf course, Pakistan had no specialist batsman left when Hasan came in, so perhaps it\u2019s not quite so cunning a tactical move, but hey...\u201d I\u2019ve liked that idea ever since Shane Warne did it at the 1996 World Cup. 34th over: Pakistan 200-7 (Sarfaraz 20, Wahab 0) It\u2019s an obvious thing to say, so I\u2019ll say it: wickets, not runs, will win this World Cup. Sarfaraz is playing for his lower-order partner, rather than the other way round, by taking singles at every opportunity. And quite right too, the way Hassan Ali is playing. He hits Richardson for consecutive boundaries through extra cover \u2013 the first timed, the second butchered. This is spectacular stuff from Hassan Ali. He\u2019s scored 32 fr- ach, he\u2019s out. He tried to pull the next ball and top-edged it to fine leg, where Khawaja took a calm catch. Hassan Ali played a blistering cameo: 32 from 15 balls with three fours and three sixes. 33rd over: Pakistan 191-6 (Sarfaraz 20, Hassan 24) Hassan Ali hits his third six in five balls, cuffing Maxwell miles over long on. He has raced to 24 from 11 balls - and given his team an outside chance of the most Pakistan victory imaginable. 32nd over: Pakistan 182-6 (Sarfaraz 17, Hassan 17) Hassan Ali hasn\u2019t given the game up. He belts Richardson for consecutive sixes, a swat over midwicket followed a swipe over long on. The tiger is cornered. 31st over: Pakistan 168-6 (Sarfaraz 17, Hassan 5) Hassan Ali edges Maxwell past the keeper Carey for four. Pakistan need 140 from 19 overs. 30th over: Pakistan 160-6 (Sarfaraz 15, Hassan 0) This is over. Australia have taken a shortcut through Pakistan\u2019s middle order, with Asif Ali the latest to go. There was a bit of extra bounce from Richardson, and all Asif could do was glide it to the keeper Carey. Unlike most of the batsmen before him, Asif Ali was pretty blameless there. 29th over: Pakistan 155-5 (Sarfaraz 11, Asif 4) Finch continues. Pakistan would have wanted to target the fifth bowler, but they can\u2019t afford to lose another wicket. Six from the over, all low-risk stuff. 28th over: Pakistan 149-5 (Sarfaraz 9, Asif 3) Pakistan, who were cruising, have lost three wickets for 13 in three overs. They have a fairly long tail and will not be winning from here. \u201cYes indeed, we are truly ace at vicarious glory (over 7),\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cJust imagine what celebrations could have been like if an England WC victory coincided with triumphantly leaving the EU with no deal? The ECB might even have chartered the Vote Leave Tour Bus for the obligatory team parade around the streets of Lowestoft. Dare to dream.\u201d Pakistan have taken the fast service from Sublime to Ridiculous. They could have lost another wicket a moment ago, when Warner\u2019s throw whistled past the stumps with Shoaib Malik well short of his ground. Shoaib would have been run out without facing a ball. No matter, because he has gone second ball for nought! He inside-edged a sharp delivery from Cummins to the left of Carey, who moved very smartly down the leg side to take an excellent catch. Pakistan have fallen apart. 27th over: Pakistan 146-4 (Sarfaraz 8, Shoaib 0) Oh my, what a bonus for Australia! Finch brought himself on to use up some of the fifth bowler\u2019s allocation. Instead he got a wicket when Hafeez lifted a full toss straight to Starc on the deep midwicket boundary! Finch might have taken a wicket earlier in the over, too, when Carey missed a fairly simple chance to stump Sarfaraz. 26th over: Pakistan 139-3 (Hafeez 45, Sarfaraz 2) The new batsman Sarfaraz edges Cummins not far wide of gully at catchable height. The beauty of this tournament, apart from the balance between bat and ball, has been the amount of ebb and flow. There have been a number of games, like this, that has been almost impossible to call after three-quarters of the match. That wasn\u2019t impressive or judicious. Imam-ul-Haq can barely drag himself from the crease, because he knows he has given it away. He tried to hook a leg-side bouncer from Cummins and gloved it through to Carey, who took a simple catch. Had he missed it, it would have been a wide. 25th over: Pakistan 136-2 (Imam 53, Hafeez 44) Imam reaches fifty in style, charging Coulter-Nile to blast him high over mid-off for four. It\u2019s been an impressive, judicious innings: 73 balls, seven fours, no sixes. 24th over: Pakistan 128-2 (Imam 48, Hafeez 41) Cummins replaces Starc at the Wickets Please End and almost has an instant impact, twice beating Imam outside off stump. That was a lovely over which Imam will be happy to have survived. 23rd over: Pakistan 126-2 (Imam 47, Hafeez 40) A win today would lift Pakistan from eighth to second in the league table, and probably signal the start of a desperate dogfight for semi-final places. No team would be safe. If they can kill off Adebisi on Oz, they can kill off Australia or England at the World Cup. 22nd over: Pakistan 121-2 (Imam 45, Hafeez 37) A poor ball from Starc is back cut flamboyantly for four by the impressive Imam. Australia are in a soup\u00e7on of bother here. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re ignoring the far more important events in terms of the cricketing summer than anything going on here,\u201d says Mark Gillespie. \u201cI refer, of course, to the County Championship div2, where Haseeb Hameed is dropping anchor for Lancs, with a Tavare-esque 18 from 65 balls against Worcs. Surely this is the precursor to a glorious return to form in time for the Ashes? What could possibly go wrong?\u201d I\u2019ve given up on Hameed. It\u2019s not him, it\u2019s me. I\u2019ve denounced sporting hope for the sake of my emotional wellbeing. 21st over: Pakistan 115-2 (Imam 40, Hafeez 36) Coulter-Nile, on for Richardson, bowls a couple of wides in an otherwise good over. Australia look a little flat at the moment, though we know from decades of experience that a wicket would change everything. Pakistan need 193 from 29 overs. 20th over: Pakistan 110-2 (Imam 39, Hafeez 34) Mitchell Starc replaces Maxwell, presumably furnished with straightforward instructions from Aaron Finch: PLEASE GET ME A BLOODY WICKET. If Pakistan are sensible they will see him off rather than try to hit him out of the attack. Imam, one of the more restrained Pakistan batsmen of modern times, does just that in Starc\u2019s first over. 19th over: Pakistan 107-2 (Imam 38, Hafeez 33) This is a great spell for Pakistan. After singles from Richardson\u2019s first four deliveries, Imam spanks a back cut for four. A wide and another single make the over into double figures. Australia really need a wicket. \u201cThought you might like to know there\u2019s a decent enough D/L calculator here,\u201d says James Blanchard. \u201cIt has Pakistan slightly ahead at the moment.\u201d Ah, good one, thanks. 18th over: Pakistan 97-2 (Imam 30, Hafeez 31) Hafeez is looking really dangerous, especially against Maxwell. He dumps a lofted sweep for four and charges the next ball to thump a big straight six. He\u2019s in cracking touch \u2013 his average (47) and strike rate (105) in 2019 are the highest in any calendar year since he made his ODI debut in 2003. 17th over: Pakistan 83-2 (Imam 30, Hafeez 18) Hafeez drives Richardson through extra cover for four to continue the assertive start to his innings. Seven from the over. 16th over: Pakistan 76-2 (Imam 29, Hafeez 12) A couple of singles from Maxwell\u2019s third over. Pakistan need \u2026 232 from 34 overs. 15th over: Pakistan 74-2 (Imam 28, Hafeez 11) A Pakistan win today would put the cat right among them, especially if either of Australia\u2019s next two games (Sri Lanka and Bangladesh) is rained off. The Aussies are still favourites, and Coulter-Nile is bowling an excellent spell just now. He finishes his fourth over with a lovely outswinger that beats Hafeez. \u201cGreetings from a windowless office,\u201d says Alex. \u201cYou and TMS are my connection to the only outside world that matters. Thank you for this. I\u2019m not so sure about your bus hubris (firstly, it\u2019s dangerous to even consider England winning the damn thing). I was ready to catch \u2018World Cup Fever\u2019 but it\u2019s yet to arrive. This is 100% thanks to Sky and Channel 4\u2019s choice to bury the coverage. I\u2019d guess that a lot of casual fans don\u2019t know much of what\u2019s happened so far, and most kids aren\u2019t being given the chance to care.\u201d You might all be right about the bus tour. I just think that, if England reach the semi-finals, the whole country will be cricket loopy. Many won\u2019t have a clue why they\u2019re cheering, or why they\u2019re booing Joe Root, but they\u2019ll be loopy nonetheless. 14th over: Pakistan 69-2 (Imam 26, Hafeez 8) Another quiet over from Maxwell \u2013 until Hafeez saunters down the track to spank the final delivery over extra cover for four. That was a powerful statement of intent from the old boy. 13th over: Pakistan 62-2 (Imam 24, Hafeez 3) Coulter-Nile ends another good over with a low-bouncing delivery that beats Hafeez. Pakistan are taking a round off, in boxing terminology, because they know they can\u2019t really afford to lose any more early wickets. \u201cThe skies are looking dark at the Aus v Pak game,\u201d says Craig Mills. \u201cWhat are the D/L totals Pakistan need?\u201d It won\u2019t come into play until after 20 overs, and even then it depends on how many wickets have been lost. All of which is to say: I don\u2019t know. Sorry. 12th over: Pakistan 60-2 (Imam 23, Hafeez 2) Glenn Maxwell comes into the attack. There\u2019s no Marcus Stoinis today, so he may have to bowl a full 10 overs. Four singles from a low-key first over. 11th over: Pakistan 56-2 (Imam 21, Hafeez 0) This is a vital blow for Australia. Babar Azam, who was playing delightfully, hooks Coulter-Nile straight to Richardson on the fine leg boundary. It was smart bowling from Coulter-Nile, who got the bouncer high enough that Babar would not be able to control the shot. He looked in such good touch, and earlier in the over played a sumptuous straight drive for four. And for what. 10th over: Pakistan 51-1 (Imam 20, Babar 26) Richardson follows Babar with a fine delivery that deflects off the bottom-edge onto the body and just wide of the stumps. A fine over is tarnished by the last delivery - it\u2019s far too straight and that allows Babar to use his rubber wrists to manoeuvre it to the fine-leg boundary. Good game, this. \u201cHow great was it to see Amir bowl like that?\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cImam Ul-Haq the danger for Pakistan - he might score 75 at a strike rate of 75-80 putting too much pressure elsewhere. He\u2019s the Shai Hope of Pakistan.\u201d 9th over: Pakistan 46-1 (Imam 19, Babar 22) Nathan Coulter-Nile comes on for Pat Cummins; he\u2019s been a weak link so far in this tournament (his combined figures before today were 28-2-169-1). His first over is tidy, apart from one delivery to Imam that is too straight and runs away for four leg-byes. 8th over: Pakistan 40-1 (Imam 18, Babar 21) Kane Richardson replaces Starc (3-1-16-0). His first ball is edged just short of slip by Imam. Then \u2013 after the first rotation of strike in seven overs - Babar plays an ingenious, one-handed flick past short fine leg for four. He is in delightful touch. 7th over: Pakistan 34-1 (Imam 17, Babar 16) Babar plays another hold-the-pose cover drive for four off Cummins. \u201cThis is just sensational to watch,\u201d says Ian Ward on Sky, and he\u2019s not wrong. Pakistan are getting \u2018em in boundaries; the last 32 runs have come that way. \u201cRob,\u201d says Damian Burns. \u201cThere may be a bus tour but whether anyone is there to watch it go past is another matter. Did you see the opening ceremony? There were more people at my great uncle Gav\u2019s funeral, and he spent most of his life hidden in the corner of an old boozer on the outskirts of Crewe\u2026\u201d Arf. Trust me, if there\u2019s one thing England does well, it\u2019s vicarious glory. 6th over: Pakistan 30-1 (Imam 17, Babar 12) Imam gets successive boundaries off Starc. The first came when he top-edged a roundhouse hook over the slips; the second was a lovely clip off the pads from an attempted yorker. Both teams are declining to take a backward step, which is making for rich entertainment. An expensive over ends with Imam flicking a poor ball to fine leg for another boundary. 5th over: Pakistan 18-1 (Imam 5, Babar 12) That\u2019s a gorgeous shot from Babar, who times a full ball from Cummins through the covers for four. This is fascinating stuff, because Australia have three slips so they want Babar to drive. And he is happy to oblige; from the last ball of the over he plays an even better drive through extra cover for four, holding the pose at the end of his follow through. He has so much class. 4th over: Pakistan 10-1 (Imam 5, Babar 4) Imam pulls Starc disdainfully for four, an aural delight of a shot. Pakistan, it seems, are not in the mood to be bullied by the Australian fast bowlers. \u201cRemember 2005?\u201d weeps Ben Powell. \u201cWinning the Ashes led to an open top bus tour through the centre of London and untold thousands in Trafalgar Square to watch it. What odds this being repeated if (if) England do win the CWC? I suspect that the answer is slim to none, very sadly. And what is different between now and 2005 \u2013 the 2005 Ashes being the last free to view live international cricket in the UK.\u201d Seriously? I think there will definitely be a bus tour if they won the World Cup, although I doubt anyone will match the sheer dignity of Freddie Flintoff\u2019s celebrations. 3rd over: Pakistan 6-1 (Imam 1, Babar 4) I suppose it\u2019s a little unfair to criticise Fakhar \u2013 it\u2019s the way he plays and all that \u2013 but there is such a drop off after Cummins and Starc that the smart option was surely to play low-risk cricket for a few overs. Cummins has three slips and a short leg for the new batsman Babar Azam, who gets off the mark with an uppish slash through point for four. Well that was pretty thick. Fakhar has given his wicket away, top-edging a cut stroke straight to Kane Richardson at third man. He was beaten for pace as much as anything. 2nd over: Pakistan 2-0 (Imam 1, Fakhar 0) Pakistan\u2019s difficult start continues, with Imam playing and missing at Mitchell Starc\u2019s first, fifth and sixth deliveries. A maiden from Starc. \u201cI was musing earlier and it occurred to me that Pakistan are turning into the cricketing version of The Fall,\u201d says Ian Forth. \u201cBrilliant but erratic and just when you thought it was safe to write them off after one horrific display too many, back they surge with indomitable cussedness. Is Sarfaraz starting to resemble Mark E Smith himself behind the stumps (and is that Steve Hanley we see lurking at deep midwicket)?\u201d 1st over: Pakistan 2-0 (Imam 1, Fakhar 0) The ever-reliable Pat Cummins starts the innings with \u2026 a front-foot no-ball. Replays show it was a very harsh call. Cummins ensures no damage is done by the free hit, ripping a bouncer past Imam\u2019s attempted pull, and he follows up with a big legcutter that beats the outside edge. That prompts Aaron Finch to bring in a third slip, reinforcing the view that the first 10 overs of this innings will like a Test match. A glorious over from Cummins ends with a beauty that snaps off the seam to beat Fakhar. Here come the Pakistan openers. Fakhar Zaman is the key to this runchase, I think. If he\u2019s still batting after 20 overs, Pakistan will have a great chance. Thanks Jonathan, hello everyone. With the greatest respect, none of you have a clue what you\u2019re talking about. Nor do I; not when Pakistan are in this mood. They were Pakistan in excelsis during that Australian innings, both sublime and ridiculous. Much of the good stuff came from Mohammad Amir, who continued his spectacular and heartwarming return to form with a superb spell of five for 30. Amir took five ODI wickets in two years between the Champions Trophy and this World Cup; since the tournament started, he\u2019s taken 10 in two weeks. I still think Australia\u2019s total of 307 will be enough. But when Pakistan are in this mood, thinking is pretty dangerous. That\u2019s about all you need from me for now. To find out if Pakistan can complete the most unlikely of turnarounds stay tuned with Rob Smyth. I\u2019ll catch you back here later in the week. Trying to document that innings in real time was like trying to nail jelly to a wall. Nothing seemed to follow expectation. Pakistan won what appeared to be a decisive toss and then threw away any natural advantage with poor bowling and even worse fielding. Then Australia looked on course for 400-plus and a near walkover but conspired to shoot themselves in the foot. The pitch was not the capricious greentop it appeared when it was belatedly uncovered and the ball barely swung or seamed. At the interval you\u2019d have to say the match is evenly poised. Australia will be pleased with runs on the board - especially as so many dismissals came from batsmen being caught out mistiming drives - but they will also rue the lack of a frontline spinner to offer a change of pace and control and they will be aware how quickly the runs can flow once a partnership is set. Individually there are only three names to check off. For Australia Aaron Finch rode his luck on his way to 82 while David Warner\u2019s 107 improved with every passing over following his dismissal. For Pakistan it was all about Mohammad Amir. 5-30 from his ten overs in a display that almost single-handedly keeps his side in the contest. Amir has a five-for! In the slot to Starc but it\u2019s an off-cutter which means Starc\u2019s big levers don\u2019t come down with the best timing and the ball only carries to the safe hands of long off. What a performance from Amir. Brilliant from Amir. Third ball of his tenth over is an inswinger yorker that beats Carey\u2019s awkward swipe and cannons into his back ankle. Given out onfield and confirmed by DRS. If Pakistan somehow win this they can thank their left-arm star for giving them a sniff. He has been incredible. Amir has Carey LBW... 48th over: Australia 302-8 (Carey 19, Starc 0) The sun is now out at Taunton and there\u2019s a suggestion the pitch may be quickening up as the recent rain dries out. Pakistan will feel they\u2019re right in this. Matt Dony is back with his right to reply. \u201cAs I was typing, I did wonder about the order of the process. I don\u2019t necessarily disagree with Gareth Owen. I think it\u2019s a bit of a chicken-and-egg scenario. The truth probably lies in the middle. We invest in sportspeople because we relate to them AND because of exposure to their performances. And then, both factors feed into each other. I guess, the plain fact is, NEITHER factor is being addressed in regards to cricket in this country. And, no, not that M Dhoni, but a perfect homophone. I always enjoy listening to coverage of India; living vicariously through cricket commentary.\u201d This peculiar innings is winding its way to a disappointing end for Australia. Cummins is the latest to go, rocking back and guiding Hasan to Sarfraz behind the stumps with a late cut that turned into the kind of shot you see at slips catching practice. Actually, on replay, it\u2019s clear Hasan beat him for pace, so more of an uncontrolled chase at the ball than a guide. Either way, the outcome is the same. 47th over: Australia 300-7 (Carey 18, Cummins 1) A fired up Wahab hurling bouncers at Australians is great fun, even if it is in the 47th over of an ODI in which his side has already conceded 300. He puts Cummins on notice with a vicious lifter, presumably already padding up in expectation of a returning salvo later. Gareth Owen disagrees with Matt Dony\u2019s assessment of sport on TV. \u201cI think Matt Dony\u2019s analysis of the popularity of cycling\u2019s personalities is entirely backwards. We got to know Wiggins, Hoy and Pendleton\u2019s character through their exposure on TV - the exposure came first, and led directly to their public personae. And, Wiggins aside, its pretty hard to recall anything particularly extraordinary about British cyclist that was not tied up with their performance. Cavendish is blunt and honest, Geraint Thomas is wry, and Hoy and Pendleton are likeable enough, but none of them are much more engaging than Woakes, Buttler or Root are in interviews, or more entertainingly nuts than Mark Wood. But only cricket badgers have ever heard Mark Wood interviewed.\u201d Meanwhile Adam Levine has found a funny. \u201cWith reference to M Dony\u2019s (presumably NOT M Dhoni) comment about how many members of this England team the public could pick out of a line up, I think a few already have picked Ben Stokes out of a line up! (Too soon?) Cheers, Adam Levine (no, not THAT Adam Levine).\u201d In what I think is known as regression towards the mean, Coulter-Nile is out for two. Length from Wahab, swipe from NCN, inside-edge behind the wicket and Sarfraz takes a tidy catch. Pakistan are giving themselves a sniff here. 46th over: Australia 298-6 (Carey 17, Coulter-Nile 2) Fortunately for Australia Pakistan only have one Mohammad Amir, meaning they can score freely against whoever is bowling from the other end. In this case it\u2019s Hasan Ali who is nudged and nurdled for ones after being carted in agricultural fashion for four through midwicket by the enterprising Carey. 45th over: Australia 291-6 (Carey 11, Coulter-Nile 1) There have been two matches played this morning: Australia versus Pakistan, and Australia versus Mohammad Amir. 3-25 off nine overs is a heck of a return considering the mess going on around him. It\u2019s that man Amir again. Length to Marsh who swipes hard but he can\u2019t clear long-on and Shoaib pouches safely. 44th over: Australia 286-5 (Marsh 22, Carey 8) Better from Hasan, settling into a rhythm against the two left-handers but he can\u2019t do anything with Carey\u2019s improvisation, the wicket-keeper stepping to leg and driving forcefully through the off-side. 43rd over: Australia 278-5 (Marsh 21, Carey 1) What an over from Mohammad Amir. One run, one wicket, four dots. Nothing flash, just line and length with the pitch doing the rest. Pakistan have made a performance like that look much more difficult than it should have done. \u201cFurther to Mark Berkeley\u2019s thoughts,\u201d begins Matt Dony, \u201cthere were more factors involved in cycling\u2019s coverage. The track success in the 2012 Olympics was also a huge factor, and the cyclists themselves became more famous. Chris Hoy, Bradley Wiggins, Victoria Pendleton and others all became recognisable beyond the world of cycling in the build-up to the Olympics, even more so after them. They were \u2018characters\u2019 in one way or another, and the media made them more famous. How many people beyond cricket fans would recognise Woakes or Roy? I would guess Joe Root would be the only member of the England team that many people could pick out of a line-up. TV coverage obviously needs to be improved, but, without being too cynical (because it\u2019s a horrible thought that it\u2019s a requirement for a sportsman), players\u2019 media profiles might need to improve to connect with the public.\u201d Amir returns for his third spell - and just like with his second, he strikes first ball. It was in the slot to Khawaja to be fair but the drive is mistimed and goes straight to Wahab at mid-off. Brendon McCullum on comms suggests it just held up in the pitch a little, which is just what Pakistan\u2019s batsmen want to hear in advance of their pursuit of a mammoth target. On further review it was a slower ball that deceived the batsman. Terrific bowling. 42nd over: Australia 277-4 (Marsh 21, Khawaja 18) It\u2019s like the opening spell again with Pakistan\u2019s pacemen failing with their lines and lengths, gifting Australia boundaries. Hasan is the latest culprit, straying onto Khawaja\u2019s pads and inviting the ball to be run down to the fine-leg fence. Brian Withington has revisited the nominative determinism chat from earlier. \u201cBuilding on your \u2018Taunt-on\u2019 trade-marked theme of cricket ground nominative determinism, can a case be made for Edg(e)-baston being fated to be helpful to the keeper and slip cordon? As for The Oval, which really came first, the shape or the name?\u2019. 41st over: Australia 269-4 (Marsh 20, Khawaja 13) Concerns about Khawaja\u2019s ability to score quickly are dismissed with consecutive fours against Wahab, the first pulled powerfully, the second cut deftly. Marsh also joins in the fun, placing a full toss between cover and extra cover. Australia back up and motoring again. 40th over: Australia 256-4 (Marsh 16, Khawaja 4) Shaun Marsh crisply drives Australia\u2019s first boundary in a while but it owes a lot to more grim Pakistan fielding with mid-off providing the kind of resistance one might expect from a damp piece of one-ply loo roll. Shaheen finishes with 2-70 from his ten overs. Remarkably, that\u2019s his most economical figures of the English summer. 39th over: Australia 247-4 (Marsh 9, Khawaja 2) Since Finch\u2019s dismissal Australia have lost wickets at regular intervals, slowing their momentum somewhat. They remain on course for a massive total but expectations have probably been revised down to around the 350 mark with this pair at the crease. Wahab continues his good work, he\u2019s conceded just two boundaries in his six overs, as the two new batsmen regroup. 38th over: Australia 243-4 (Marsh 7, Khawaja 0) Finally, Khawaja gets a bat, but is it good for Australia he\u2019s coming in at this match situation? I\u2019ve upset Laf Zuccarello. \u201cJP, me old mate. I understand your barely contained glee at the semi-collapse of Australia but don\u2019t you dare disparage Shane MacGowan. I grew up with that man crooning me to sleep (via cassette or CD not physically... that would have scarred me). I lost my train of thought but my outrage remains.\u201d To make amends, here\u2019s one of my favourite songs of all time. Shaheen\u2019s actually finding a decent rhythm now after his early travails, hitting the deck hard and crucially on a good length. And it pays dividends! After pinning Warner on his crease with some extra pace he offers a hint of width that the batsman chases but doesn\u2019t time and the ball loops high in the air and into the hands of the cover sweeper. In an unexpected turn of events Pakistan hold onto the catch. 37th over: Australia 239-3 (Warner 107, Marsh 4) Good grief! Another drop! Wahab finally returns for his second spell, Warner rocks back and guides a cut straight to third man at waist height and Asif Ali\u2019s butterfingers send the ball to the turf. Awful awful awful. 36th over: Australia 235-3 (Warner 104, Marsh 3) Not the worst over in the world from Shaheen, and he should have been the one celebrating when Warner was soaking up the adulation of the Taunton crowd, but this game remains firmly on Australia\u2019s terms. It not how, it\u2019s how many. Warner brings up his century with an edge at catchable height that flies between keeper and slip and down to third-man. After pushing his heart down from his mouth and back into his chest he grins like a bearded Cheshire cat, raises his bat in the air and celebrates a 15th ODI ton. 35th over: Australia 228-3 (Warner 97, Marsh 3) It\u2019s remiss of me not to focus more on Warner\u2019s innings. He\u2019s patiently accumulating his way to a very well worked century at almost exactly a run-a-ball. With Marsh at the other end he moves within one stroke of a ton. 33rd over: Australia 224-3 (Warner 95, Marsh 1) Maxwell just played the wrong line. I guess when you\u2019re him and you\u2019re 20 off eight in a match situation like this you\u2019re entitled to go for your shots, but, well, more fuel to the fire for his detractors. Now it\u2019s Shaun Marsh\u2019s turn to bump Khawaja down the order. \u201cJust to add to this debate - ECB need to look at the example of cycling coverage,\u201d emails Mark Berkeley. \u201cITV4 schedule cleared for daily coverage of the Tour de France with sensibly timed daily highlights on top. Increase in uptake of recreational cycling due in some part to exposure to exploits of Wiggins, Froome, Thomas et al.\u201d The answer to my rhetorical question is a resounding \u201cno\u201d. Sarfraz returns to pace and after gifting Warner a boundary Shaheen lands one in a decent area, Maxwell misses it, and his stumps are splayed like Shane MacGowan\u2019s teeth. 33rd over: Australia 218-2 (Warner 90, Maxwell 20) Even a circumspect Maxwell can\u2019t turn down a couple of gifts from Hafeez. The first is short and loopy and slapped through midwicket. The second is a fraction too short, fails to turn and the Victorian is on it in a flash, smashing it over long on. The blood pumping he then just caresses a checked drive straight over the bowler\u2019s head for the easiest six you\u2019d ever see. Could that be the start of something special? Maxwell is already 20 off just eight balls. 32nd over: Australia 202-2 (Warner 89, Maxwell 5) This phase of the match feels like a middle distance race with the front-runner just dropping the pace to make sure they\u2019re primed to sprint on the bell. Against Shoaib Maxwell and Warner are content to dab ones and place the ball into gaps for twos instead of attempting the big heave-ho. \u201cWahab Riaz remains the only good bowler against Australia at a World Cup even as he faces sloppy fielding from the rest of his own team... What\u2019s new?\u201d emails OB Jato. Wahab has bene decent but Amir has been the standout by a mile. Surprising Sarfraz hasn\u2019t paired them in a spell to really put the pressure on Australia. 31st over: Australia 196-2 (Warner 86, Maxwell 2) More darts, this time from Hafeez, and Australia are happy to nudge the singles and keep the scoreboard ticking over. Apologies David Seare, I was a little late to this: \u201cAmir to Warner and Smith. Cricket\u2019s most dishonest contest? Ultimate cricket shithousery.\u201d 30th over: Australia 191-2 (Warner 82, Maxwell 0) Shoaib\u2019s darts are on the money again, rattling through an over containing five dots to Warner from around the wicket. \u201cHey, emailing from Karachi, Pakistan,\u201d hey Tara Khan. \u201cIt\u2019s an hour and a half till my workday finishes, am MEGA stressed both due to my not doing any of my work and this frustrating play from our men \u2013 not sure I want work to end because that means I\u2019ll have to watch. We care more about cricket than we do our own families. Have never been interested in sport, nor particularly patriotic. But have risen up out of my slumber to become both. Bad timing, although with our team it\u2019s impossible to know when is good timing.\u201d 29th over: Australia 189-2 (Warner 81, Maxwell 0) And here comes Maxwell! Who knows what Australia are doing with their batting order, holding back Khawaja and Marsh, but I\u2019m not complaining. 20 overs of Maxwellball could send this score into the stratosphere. Darts from both ends for Pakistan now with Shoaib and Hafeez bowling in tandem. And it works! Smith goes too hard outside off stump, the ball holds up in the surface and he skews a high catch that Asif does well to claim in the covers. The second Australia to perish in that manner and Pakistan will feel they\u2019re on their way back into this contest. 28th over: Australia 187-1 (Warner 80, Smith 9) Apologies, some gremlins in the system just getting in the way of providing these updates. You haven\u2019t missed any wickets, but Warner is now starting to tee off, launching Shoaib over long-on for a satisfying six. 26th over: Australia 165-1 (Warner 62, Smith 6) More middle-overs darts, this time from Shoaib Malik and they do the job. 25th over: Australia 165-1 (Warner 62, Smith 6) More brilliance form Amir. He is making his teammates look pretty foolish now, moving the ball both ways and proving difficult to get away. He has 1-16 from his six overs, the rest of Pakistan\u2019s figures are considerably uglier. \u201cAustralia are currently going faster than their highest ever score, 434 against South Africa in 2006,\u201d emails Piyush Pushkar. Stats from Cricinfo here - http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/14676/statistics/238200/south-africa-vs-australia-5th-odi-australia-tour-of-south-africa-2005-06. From the worm, it looks like they were around 130-140 at over 22. Could they score higher than that? They\u2019ve got the wickets in hand...\u201d Two words: Glenn Maxwell. Anything is possible. He doesn\u2019t, the batsman was so far outside the line of off stump he was practically in Swindon. Amir thinks he has Warner LBW... 24th over: Australia 163-1 (Warner 61, Smith 5) Can Pakistan back up Amir\u2019s excellence? Can they heck as like! Hassan over-pitches twice and on both occasions finds Warner\u2019s perfectly timed blade, the ball ignoring any advice to decelerate on its way across the Taunton turf until it collides with the boundary rope. If those two strokes were glorious they\u2019re nothing on Smith finding the fence for the first time with a drive on the up a mile outside off stump that\u2019s so majestic the batsman could retire immediately, satisfied he had conquered cricket. 23rd over: Australia 149-1 (Warner 52, Smith 1) Oof! What an over from Amir He has been the pick of the bowlers this morning, the only one to hit that good length consistently, and he finds it repeatedly at the start of his second spell. Finch went unnecessarily hard at one to throw his wicket away but Warner has shadow batting to a couple that sliced through him. It goes to show how testing this surface could have been had Pakistan found their range sooner. Pakistan have not played well so far. Out of nowhere, a breakthrough! After offering two previous chances Finch is finally caught. He\u2019ll be disappointed with his shot too, launching at the first delivery of the returning Amir only to sky a thick edge that was taken soundly by Hafeez in the covers. 22nd over: Australia 146-0 (Finch 82, Warner 50) It\u2019s hard to discern a bowling strategy from Pakistan this morning. Amir showed the way early and Wahab\u2019s deck-hitting has hinted at a plan B but there has been a lot of thoughtless dross in and around that. Hasan is the latest to disappoint, missing with his line and length and front foot in a poor over. 21st over: Australia 137-0 (Finch 79, Warner 44) Australia were happy to milk Hafeez in his second over but Finch can\u2019t resist going the tonk this time around. To balls three and four he hoicks powerfully over midwicket for consecutive sixes - clickety click in bingo money. Effortless and brutal. Pakistan are flailing. 20th over: Australia 122-0 (Finch 66, Warner 43) Hasan Ali gets another go and he\u2019s in the right areas often enough but this partnership is in cruise control now, just turning the strike over at will. Sarah O\u2019Regan\u2019s back. \u201cMe again. Pakistan\u2019s bowlers seem to be employing my questionable bowling technique - I\u2019m known as a slow, non-spin bowler. Still, at least I\u2019m enthusiastic about it, and it\u2019s not my day job. Put some welly into it, lads!\u201d Indeed. It has been a poor showing, enlivened once every couple of overs by one that does something off a length. Wahab has shown a bit of back bending can produce results but it needs to be backed up in the field and from both ends, which it hasn\u2019t. 19th over: Australia 117-0 (Finch 63, Warner 42) Much tighter from Hafeez\u2019s second over. His old school middle-overs darts keep Australia to three singles and a leg-bye. \u201cAfternoon, time for some pedantry!\u201d Welcome aboard Alex Thomas. \u201cAlistair Connor refers to \u201cthe Hoi Polloi\u201d in his architecture analogy. About the only thing I remember from GCSE ancient Greek from 23 years ago, is that hoi = the, polloi= people, so saying \u201cthe Hoi Polloi\u201d is like saying \u201cthe The People\u201d I\u2019ll see myself out\u2026.\u201d 18th over: Australia 113-0 (Finch 61, Warner 41) Shaheen\u2019s over after drinks is a textbook example of Pakistan\u2019s issues this morning. When he hits the right length the pitch looks juicy and in the bowler\u2019s favour but he only does that once and from the other five deliveries Australia accumulate proactively. There\u2019s been a few of you helping out Derek Stocker - you\u2019re a lovely bunch - recommending he seeks out Guerilla Radio for an unofficial commentary feed, and also that if he goes to the ICC\u2019s homepage he can access BBC TMS. Thanks to all of you who contributed. A quick catch-up on the correspondence that\u2019s been flooding in following Andy Bull\u2019s column on the difficulty to access the World Cup on TV in the UK. Tom Wellman: \u201cCan\u2019t agree more with Andy Bull, James Walsh et. al. This World Cup is going to pass without being noticed by the public at large, even if England win it. Staggering short-termism by the ECB. I\u2019ve seen more brains in a pork-pie, to quote the inimitable Yorkshireman.\u201d James Maltby: \u201cNot wishing to bang on about the highlights, and Andy\u2019s article is spot on, but... I finally caught up on the ENG v BAN highlights last night. What a fantastic job they did of capturing the building tension of the opening overs as I\u2019d experienced it listening live on TMS, as Bangladesh\u2019s canny opening bowling restricted Roy and Bairstow to a handful of scoring shots, while the England pair showed surprising maturity and patience picking off the rare bad ball before accelerating beautifully from mid way through over five. Oh no, of course they didn\u2019t. You just got the opening run, any boundaries, and it all looked like a cakewalk. Grrrrr. If they showed highlights of Flintoff\u2019s perfect over at Edgbaston 2005 they\u2019d only show the wickets... Can we have fewer replays and a bit more sense of the ebb &amp; flow?\u201d Alistair Connor: \u201cMay I suggest an architectural analogy to the cordoning-off of TV access to the World Cup. I once attended a concert (early Baroque) in a cathedral equipped with a rood screen (or jub\u00e9, as it was in France). The orchestra, and a small number of monied spectators, were seated in the choir, and I, with the hoi polloi, was in the nave. We could see nothing of the musicians (there were a couple of CCTV screens, for what that\u2019s worth). The acoustics were fine; our seats were cheap; the optics were horrible. Never again. To paraphrase Wikipedia, throughout Europe, in the Catholic countries, rood screens were mostly removed during the Counter-Reformation, when the retention of any visual barrier between the laity and the high altar was widely seen as inconsistent with the decrees of the Council of Trent. That\u2019s Trento in Italy, not the cricket ground. But it\u2019s a clue for what is needed, perhaps.\u201d Mohammad Yousuf Nasim: \u201cWhile traveling to England recently, I ultimately gave up on finding any place showing the match. What\u2019s more, the one match I had a ticket for (Pakistan v Sl in Bristol) was rained out!) In fact, it is only once I returned to Pakistan that I actually managed to see a bit of cricket.\u201d John Withington: \u201cI can\u2019t allow another debate about the lack of free to air TV coverage to go by without again trying to plug my own highlights package from the recent inaugural World Series final. When the real thing isn\u2019t available there\u2019s always Subbuteo cricket after all! With apologies to James Maltby for the focus on key moments I invite readers to spend 90 seconds between OBO updates to catch a look at Allan Donald cleaning out Sir Donald Bradman, or Chris Gayle closing the innings with a hat-trick ball?\u201d 17th over: Australia 106-0 (Finch 58, Warner 38) Time for spin and Mohammad Hafeez, and - oh dear - another drop! This was tougher than Asif\u2019s but still gettable. Finch got a thick edge to a wide one outside off but it ricochets straight out of Sarfraz\u2019s gloves with the keeper up to the stumps. Finch reacts by bludgeoning the right-arm offie down the ground for four, slashing him through the covers for four more, then completing the set with a high and handsome flick over midwicket for six! Australia have ridden their luck this morning but they are now rampant. Pakistan only have themselves to blame. \u201cEvening Jonathan,\u201d splendid to have you around Phil Withall. \u201cTotally agree with Andy Bull\u2019s magnificent piece. However, it\u2019s not just the UK that has this problem. Australia is in an even worse position, for as far as I can see, there aren\u2019t any highlight show on free to air television. It really is a farcical situation. Greed overwhelming common sense. I can only see things getting worse as the broadcast landscape becomes more fragmented, with more platforms trying to get a foothold in the coverage. Not a promising situation for future engagement.\u201d 16th over: Australia 91-0 (Finch 44, Warner 38) Better from Shaheen, finally, beating Finch with one that just misses off stump then follows it up with a nice inducker that clips the pad and prompts an outrageous celebrappeal. After five strong deliveries the good work is undone by a limp dive by mid-on allowing a checked drive to scuttle through for four. \u201cDear Jonathan I have been the organiser of the mighty Dulwich 7th XI\u2019s annual tour to Somerset on the Whitsun bank holiday weekend since 2008. We have had around 50 matches scheduled over that time (won only about 5 but hey we are the 7th XI). Anyway, we\u2019ve only had a couple or so games washed out over the years. Perhaps more importantly in the context of today\u2019s game, experience shows that any forecast suggesting showers late in the day is likely to be wrong. There\u2019s always a lovely glow at the end of the day and expect nothing less today. We will get a full match today, I assure you. On a side note, we\u2019re always looking for ringers so do let us know if anyone willing to play with a bunch of mediocre, middle-aged (some are a tad older I must admit) cider-swilling egotists? Up your strasse? Best, Pan \u2018Pangry\u2019 Pylas, Tour Organizer of Dulwich 7th XI annual tour to Somerset.\u201d 15th over: Australia 86-0 (Finch 40, Warner 38) That was an all-action over from Wahab. Aside from the LBW shout there was almost a run-out at the non-striker\u2019s end, Finch was roughed up by the first proper bouncer of the day and the speed gun topped 90mph for the first time. Still, Australia survive and are now very handily placed. \u201cRelated to Ian Forth\u2019s comment (12th over), my son is studying neuroscience at university (he gets his brains from his mother),\u201d emails Nick Williamson. \u201cAny discussion about how he is getting on tends to end with me saying, \u201cbut it\u2019s not exactly rocket science, is it?\u201d He was understandably a little miffed about it, until I made him watch the following Mitchell and Webb sketch. It didn\u2019t look out to the naked eye but improves somewhat with DRS showing the ball pitched in line with leg stump and wasn\u2019t bouncing that high despite being short of a length. However ball tracking eventually ends with umpire\u2019s call, height being the issue and the ball just clipping the bails - which as we know is no given this World Cup. Wahab is convinced he has Finch LBW but it\u2019s declined onfield. 14th over: Australia 79-0 (Finch 37, Warner 34) Pakistan are simply bowling too short. It\u2019s poor cricket. Australia\u2019s batsmen are just waiting on the crease, nudging ones and twos and collecting the boundaries when they\u2019re available. Not for the first time this morning Warner works one effortlessly off his hip behind square for four. Shaheen has gone for 35 off his four overs so far. The policy fo both sides not to select a front line spinner looks like being a miscalculation. Sticking with frustration at TV coverage, Derek Stocker can\u2019t even get the radio! \u201cGGGGGGGGrrrrrrrr. So blinking frustrated. I am an OAP living in Bulgaria which may as well be a chunk of space rock bouncing off the atmosphere. I cannot understand why the BBC radio coverage keeps coming up - this is not available in your location. Bad enough that I cannot afford to breach the paywall but not being able to listen is a slap in the chops with sticks. Thank goodness I can stay with the Guardian and get my cricket jollies from your typed commentary.\u201d 13th over: Australia 76-0 (Finch 35, Warner 33) Oh dear, it\u2019s going from bad to worse for Pakistan. Finally the first chance of the day is created but ASIF ALI GRASSES FINCH AT SLIP. Wahab slanted one across the right hander at pace, Finch threw the kitchen sink at it but could only send an edge flying straight to Asif just in front of his face but the ball bursts the fingers and runs down to the third-man boundary. Insult is added to injury next ball with four glanced off Finch\u2019s hip to fine-leg. 12th over: Australia 65-0 (Finch 25, Warner 32) Shaheen\u2019s back for his second effort after he wasted the new ball. His radar is slightly better but now he has two set batsmen to bowl to and they\u2019re waiting on the crease to bunt those unnecessarily short deliveries around for ones and twos. Ian Forth is a fan (like me) of Steve Rhodes leaning on manking putting a man on the moon to advocate for reserve days. \u201cLove the \u2018man on the moon\u2019 reach. I was in a meeting recently where my colleague claimed the task he\u2019d set his team was \u201chardly rocket surgery\u201d. I always think it wisest to suppress one\u2019s guffaws on these occasions and forward the comment to an international newspaper later.\u201d 11th over: Australia 60-0 (Finch 23, Warner 30) Wahab remains shorter than the optimal length but he\u2019s bowling a heavier ball than his colleagues, hitting Warner\u2019s bat harder than the Australian expects and drawing the first false stroke in an age. As with all Pakistan\u2019s bowlers so far the consistency is lacking a floaty half-volley turns a tidy over into a decent one for Australia. Frustrating for Sarfraz so far with only Amir offering him any control. 10th over: Australia 56-0 (Finch 22, Warner 27) Hassan\u2019s promising opening over now looks like an early peak as another over goes for handy Australian runs. Four of them arrive in leg-byes with the line to Warner too tight while the length is again consistently too short. This has not been what Pakistan wanted after winning the toss. Martin Coult has joined in the lamentation on access to cricket on TV. \u201cI know the cricket authorities probably think the jam that Sky provides today is worth cordoning off the game to the general public, HOWEVER with the majority of schools no longer having facilities for the game one wonders where future generations of decent cricketers are going to be found. I grew up in the era of all tests being on the BBC \u2013 and it truly fuelled my love of the game.\u201d 9th over: Australia 49-0 (Finch 22, Warner 24) Wahab Riaz is the fourth Pakistan quick to try to exploit what should be favourable conditions but he can\u2019t get the ball to talk either. He does beat Finch with one that zips off the pitch angling across him but it\u2019s too short to induce an edge. There is furious agreement with James Walsh and Andy Bull about the ICC/ECB handling of broadcast rights. John Starbuck has emailed his thoughts while Guy Hornsby is in on the tweet. 8th over: Australia 47-0 (Finch 21, Warner 23) Australia are flying. Hassan can\u2019t repeat his excellent opening over, again falling prey to that shorter length and enduring Finch driving him square on the up and Warner punching him off the back foot. Ominous signs for Pakistan with both batsmen playing with intent, running hard, looking singles, and punishing anything in their hitting zones. 7th over: Australia 35-0 (Finch 16, Warner 18) Finally a loose delivery from Amir who leaks onto Warner\u2019s pads and is clipped confidently through midwicket for four. That shot was a good example of how punishing the outfield is here at Taunton with the square stretching near enough from cover to midwicket, meaning anything hit square just races away off the multitude of strips in various stages of preparation. \u201cI love how erudite the discussions can get on OBO!\u201d emails Mark Hooper. \u201cSky TV as Plato\u2019s Cave perhaps? It\u2019s ironic that while this game is going on unseen at Taunton, Somerset live stream their matches via Instagram\u2026 Cricket by the people for the people!\u201d 6th over: Australia 28-0 (Finch 15, Warner 12) Unsurprisingly Shaheen is removed and Hassan Ali comes on in his place. This changes the line for Australia\u2019s batsmen with Hassan a right-arm over bowler. He begins tidily, hitting the deck hard at 85mph, initially bowling a tight line to Warner then whistling one past the outside shoulder of the bat. After ten dots in a row Warner finally breaks the shackles, bunting a single into the on-side. Excellent start from Hassan. Gil Southwood has emailed in, and we all need to send our good wishes their way. \u201cMy bicycle was stolen from central London yesterday, and only an Australian victory can bring back the kind of joy that it brought me. Please give a small cheer to the Australian side to lift my spirits on this rather overcast day. PS - if you see anyone speeding off on a black road bike with a white saddle with a thieving demeanour, tackle them for me.\u201d 5th over: Australia 27-0 (Finch 15, Warner 11) Amir has much greater control than his new ball partner and like a left-handed James Anderson slants three across Finch on a decent length then gets one to hoop back in and almost trap him on the crease. He finishes his second maiden over by throwing a wide one for Finch to chase - which he does - and almost feathers an edge behind. There are two games operating in parallel right now - a tough one for batting against Amir and an exhibition of stroke making against Shaheen. 4th over: Australia 27-0 (Finch 15, Warner 11) What was that about length? Shaheen drops short to Finch and he\u2019s walloped over midwicket for six without a moment\u2019s pause. That was instinctive and brutal, like a viper springing out of a pit. More runs follow in the form of a couple of twos before it\u2019s Warner\u2019s turn to feast on length, carting Shaheen through cow corner for four. There are two slips lurking in the cordon but they are passengers if Pakistan don\u2019t land it in the right areas. Australia motoring now. Lovely stuff from James Walsh. \u201cRe: Andy\u2019s excellent column, it has felt a bit of a Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s World Cup. In England the sport is in its sky box, so we don\u2019t know for certain it\u2019s dead. But it probably is. Heads should roll over the lack of visibility of cricket\u2019s showpiece event in the host country, but of course they won\u2019t. It\u2019s an utter shambles.\u201d 3rd over: Australia 10-0 (Finch 4, Warner 5) Testing again from Amir, beating Finch with one that skims past the outside edge. Wasim Akram on TV explains well how this is a length pitch. Anything short is hittable, anything full doesn\u2019t appear to swinging, but anything on a good length looks very testing with the new ball. It certainly doesn\u2019t appear to be unplayable at this early stage. \u201cMorning Jonathan,\u201d morning Brian Withington, \u201cI think we may have had this conversation before (?), but is Liam Plunkett an example of slightly thwarted nominative determinism or just splendid cricketing onomatopoeia? In passing my only linguistic joke involves a helter-skelter and that single word as a punchline from one missing friend being sought by another ...\u201d 2nd over: Australia 7-0 (Finch 1, Warner 5) Left arm pace from both ends it is with Shaheen Afridi sharing the new ball but he\u2019s too short to Warner, gifting him an easy four off his hip second ball. He then fails to adjust to the right-hand half of the right-left opening combination, slinging a wide down the legside. Both Aussies exchange singles in amongst all that and the defending champs are up and running. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Finch 0, Warner 0) Excellent opening over from Amir. Finch has a nibble to the first delivery on a testing length just outside off stump but avoids the edge and the ignominy of a golden duck. He lets the next one go, keeping his eye on any movement in the air or off the pitch in testing conditions. The left-handed Amir then shapes the next couple back into the right-handed batsman from over the wicket showing excellent skill and control. Finch fails to cash in on a wider one then defends soundly from the crease. Maiden to start. David Warner and Aaron Finch are out in the middle. They are joined by umpires Nigel Llong and Ruchira Palliyaguruge. Ian Gould has his feet up watching the TV. Mohammad Amir has the new white ball in his hand. Here we go! Anthem time, which means it\u2019s nearly go time. This column from Andy Bull is superb, skewering the ICC and ECB for their lamentable decisions to make accessing this world cup in England expensive and difficult, despite the levels of supposed \u201cengagement\u201d. The ECB blames the ICC, because it controls the broadcast rights. Anyone who is at all familiar with how the ICC works might be surprised to find that it has so much autonomy, especially when the chairman of the ECB, Colin Graves, also happens to be chairman of the ICC\u2019s finance and commercial affairs committee, which has power of approval over all the ICC\u2019s broadcast arrangements. The ICC on the other hand, point towards Channel 4, because it arranges its own schedules. But there is a significant caveat to that. The broadcast deal stops the broadcast channel from starting its highlights show within three hours of the end of play, so it is in effect banned from showing the games before the watershed. \u201cMorning Jonathan!\u201d Morning Sarah O\u2019Regan. \u201cLooking forward to the match today. I\u2019d like to reassure everyone about the weather - I\u2019ve put in a word with the appropriate authorities and they\u2019ve agreed not to include rain in the official schedule.\u201d Smashing, thanks so much. If you could just set a reminder to keep doing this for the next couple of months that would be swell. The Taunton pitch has been undercover sheltering from the rain for the past few days. Unsurprisingly there\u2019s a liveliness to it that Pakistan will be keen to exploit. However, Taunton is famed for its run-scoring and with Somerset posting 353 and 358 in the Royal London Cup earlier this season we can expect those short boundaries to be peppered again today. Little can be gleaned from New Zealand\u2019s shellacking of Afghanistan earlier in the tournament but the three previous ODIs at the ground include England posting 300+ in 1983, and India smacking 373 in 1999. When these sides last met in a bilateral series Australia whitewashed Pakistan in the UAE. Pakistan were understrength, the conditions were very un-English, and the resulting stats are not especially eye-catching. However, one does stand out. Aaron Finch was the leading run-scorer in that series, almost doubling the total of the next best batsman. His 451 included two tons, two fifties, and came at an average of 112.75. The Aussie skipper has been in modest form since arriving in the UK so the prospect of filling his boots against opponents he should feel confident facing arrives at an opportune moment. Max Bonnell is a tad concerned. \u201cEither I can\u2019t count, or Australia needs ten overs from Maxwell with Finch the only real backup. No margin for error there.\u201d That\u2019s right Max, unless Smith\u2019s leggies are hauled out of storage. Speaking of Bootsy Collins, the zing bail resemblance is not limited to a shared commitment to the groove. Perhaps some of the bassist\u2019s 80s outfits featured on the bail designer\u2019s mood board? Don\u2019t forget to listen to the latest The Spin podcast including the panel\u2019s take on the zing bails and their Bootsy Collins-like reluctance to deviate from a groove. Pakistan XI: Imam ul-Haq, Fakhar Zaman, Babar Azam, Mohammad Hafeez, Sarfaraz Ahmed (c/wk), Shoaib Malik, Asif Ali, Wahab Riaz, Hassan Ali, Mohammad Amir, Shaheen Afridi One change for Pakistan who have dropped Shadab Khan for Shaheen Shah Afridi. Australia XI: Aaron Finch (c), David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith, Shaun Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Alex Carey (wk), Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Kane Richardson. Two changes for Australia, the enforced one sees Shaun Marsh coming in for the injured Marcus Stoinis, while Kane Richardson replaces Adam Zampa in a selection switch. Australia going into this one without a frontline spinner. Big toss win for Pakistan! Green top, overcast, rain later, suddenly Pakistan have the edge. Just for clarification I checked the origin of Taunton and it led to be an excellent Wikipedia entry that may have been submitted by Alan Partridge. The town name derives from \u201cTown on the River Tone\u201d \u2013 or Tone Town. Cambria Farm which is now the site of a Park and ride close to Junction 25 of the M5 motorway was the site of a Bronze and Iron Age settlement and Roman farm. I do enjoy my sites of historical importance overlapping with environmentally sensitive mass transit schemes. Now, Jill, what do you think about the pedestrianisation of Norwich City centre? However, should any taunting be heard Pakistan skipper Sarfaraz Ahmed is confident it won\u2019t be coming from any fans of his team. \u201cI don\u2019t think Pakistani people will be doing it like that,\u201d Sarfaraz said. \u201cPakistan people love cricket and they love to support it, and they love the players.\u201d One of my favourite distractions is nominative determinism - that idea that people gravitate to professions because of their names (e.g. former Somerset stalwart Peter Bowler, Australian international Ashton Turner, or all the Mr Men characters). Anyway, seeing Australia are today playing at Taunton and one of the sidelines to their tournament experience has been the booing of Steve Smith and David Warner... well, you fill in the gaps. If any sub-editors read this and use the headline TAUNT-ON in tomorrow\u2019s papers with a picture of a fan holding up some sandpaper, I\u2019d like a credit please. Amod Paranjape has logged on. \u201cYour mate, the great Geoff Lemon, seems to have the knives out for one David Warner. Not that I/We (everyone other than the Australians) am/are complaining.\u201d I haven\u2019t spied Geoff with his whetstone but I\u2019m sure his logic is sound and his prose rich in persuasive imagery. He wouldn\u2019t be alone wondering what was going on with Warner though. Still, that\u2019s the beauty of such a long group phase for teams like Australia, it gives them time to readjust as the tournament progresses and for talents like Warner to recalibrate. Ordinarily around this point I\u2019d direct you to any action you may have missed yesterday, but instead I\u2019ll signpost you towards people whingeing about rain and the lack of contingencies to deal with washouts. Star of the show is Bangladesh coach Steve Rhodes who pulls out the \u201cwe put a man on the moon\u201d card in support of reserve days. We really targeted this sort of game to get two points, and I know that Sri Lanka would have fought very hard and been no pushovers at all. But we do see it as one point lost and that\u2019s disappointing. But realistically, what can we do about it? Absolutely nothing. It\u2019s out of our control, the way the weather is. If you know the English weather, sadly, we\u2019re going to get a lot of rain. We never know when the rain\u2019s going to come. At the moment, we\u2019re seeing some problems. I know logistically, it would have been a big headache for the tournament organisers, and I know it would have been difficult, but we have got quite a lot of time in between games, and if we have got to travel a day later, then so be it. We put men on the moon so why can\u2019t we have a reserve day, when actually this tournament is a long tournament? Rob Sim has joined in the Robin Smith group hug. \u201cUsed to park my deckchair square of the wicket on the boundary hoardings at Southampton just for \u201cthat\u201d square cut, with no regard for my health and safety at all!!\u201d You must have got RSI from hurling the ball back to the fielding sides. I hesitate to offer predictions where Pakistan are involved but I would say whoever wins the toss is going to have the upper hand. It does look a greenish pitch (more on that to come) and with these chilly overcast conditions it is a no-brainer bowl first toss to win. Add in the possibility of showers later and the ability for the side batting second to control the chase is going to be a big advantage. Yes! The first cricketer I ever properly emulated with the yellow bat grip. I also overly fixated on the square cut. The Judge was one of the first cricketers I ever interviewed too, and very generous he was. Smith + Smyth = must read. Behrendorff has been spotted marking out his run-up. However, on Australian TV Shane Warne just made a decent case for Kane Richardson, arguing he would prove more useful during the middle overs and avoid disrupting the established new-ball order. Weather update: Good news! It\u2019s dry in Taunton! Well, dry-ish, dry enough, and the forecast is cautiously optimistic for the remainder of the day. There is some rain around the West Country, especially later on, so we may have the occasional interruption for a passing shower. Even so, we should comfortably have enough time to avoid a washout, even if we don\u2019t see 100 overs. As much as the lack of rain is cause for celebration it remains unpleasantly chilly. Definitely a long sleeve jumper day, possibly with a sleeveless underneath and some pocket warmers. Hello everybody and thanks for tuning in to live OBO coverage of match 17 of the 2019 Cricket World Cup between Australia and Pakistan from Taunton. That opening line may read unambiguously like a cricket match will take place in Somerset today but with the weather that\u2019s been hanging around the past few days that\u2019s not something we can take for granted. We\u2019re still an hour out from the scheduled start of play and the forecast is not too bad so after consecutive washouts we should hopefully enjoy a positive result. For the tournament\u2019s sake let\u2019s hope so because this is a fixture with plenty riding on it. Both countries remain in the hunt for semi-final spots but defeat for Pakistan would significantly dent their chances of progression, while Australia will want to avoid being dragged into a qualification dogfight after suffering their first defeat of the group phase on Sunday. That pretty lacklustre showing against India was great for the I-told-you-soer\u2019s. Almost all of the potential weaknesses of Australia\u2019s selection and strategy were exposed at the Oval, including - but not limited to - the depth of the attack, the reluctance to play Nathan Lyon, and the positioning of Usman Khawaja and Glenn Maxwell in the batting order. Throw in David Warner\u2019s uncharacteristic Chris Tavar\u00e9 impression and Australia have a few issues to work through. One further problem has been foisted upon Cricket Australia with a side strain ruling allrounder Marcus Stoinis out of at least today\u2019s encounter. Mitchell Marsh has been flown over as cover but no announcement has been made on whether he will be called into the squad as in injury replacement. As for Pakistan, who knows from one day to the next? An ODI series whitewash against England preceded a World Cup warm-up defeat to Afghanistan, setting the tone for dismemberment at the hands of the West Indies in their opening group game. Doom and gloom? No chance. Pakistan\u2019s predictable unpredictability meant of course they would beat tournament favourites England to remind doubting rivals they remain a force on their day. A washout against Sri Lanka has complicated their route to the semi-finals, making today\u2019s fixture of utmost importance. The last time they faced Australia they lost five ODIs in a row in the UAE, which makes them favourites today, right? While I go off and find out the teams, observe the toss, and check on the weather, why don\u2019t you send me a tweet or drop me an email. This place is always more fun when I\u2019m not the only person talking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
