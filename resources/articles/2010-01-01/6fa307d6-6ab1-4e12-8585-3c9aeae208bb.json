The X Factor winner must have thought nothing could top opening tonight's National Television Awards. But then Jedward turned up to rock the second half of the show. And this time they had Vanilla Ice in tow. The twins' performance of Ice Ice Baby at least introduced a welcome note of possible disaster into the awards, which otherwise threw up few surprises. Most popular talent show was won by The X Factor, which beat Dancing on Ice, Britain's Got Talent and Strictly Come Dancing to the prize \u2013 possibly a good thing given that Arlene Phillips, who left the dancing show to some controversy, was presenting it. Ant and Dec took double honours, taking most popular entertainment programme for Saturday Night Takeaway, and the award for most popular entertainment presenter, or presenters, in their case. David Tennant also stepped up to the podium twice, once for Doctor Who, which won most popular drama, and a second time for outstanding drama performance. \"I really am completely staggered by this. I had no idea this was going to happen,\" said Stephen Fry, who received the NTA special contribution award, and surely cemented his place as national treasure. Fry's documentary Stephen Fry in America also took a prize, winning the most popular star travel documentary \u2013 a new and perhaps unlikely category for this year. Coronation Street brought home two awards to EastEnders' one, with the soap winning the live vote for most popular serial drama, and Craig Gazey \u2013 who plays Graeme Proctor \u2013 awarded most popular newcomer: \"I've got to dedicate this to the very great, only just late, Maggie Jones. She was such an inspiration because she was amazing right to the end,\" he said. Lacey Turner took outstanding serial drama performance for her role as Albert Square's Stacey Slater. Best popular comedy programme was won by Gavin and Stacey, which beat Benidorm, The Inbetweeners and Harry Hill's TV Burp, while most popular factual programme was won by ITV daytime show Loose Women, which triumphed in the same category as Top Gear. \"We thought we had no chance,\" said presenter Carole McGiffin.
