From the Paul Nicholls stable that has won Wincanton\u2019s biggest race 10 times, he can build on the promise he showed as a novice. He didn\u2019t win after beating Reserve Tank last November but soft ground in the Kauto Star and the Reynoldstown did not help and subsequent wind surgery may make a difference. Present Man will run his usual sound race while Sizing At Midnight looks a big price for a place. 1.30 Doncaster Few horses know how to end a Flat season better than Dakota Gold, whose form has peaked in October for back-to-back seasons. He must give weight to 14 rivals here and there are some useful talents ranged against him but it\u2019s hard to get away from him as the most likely winner. 1.50 Wincanton Perfect Myth looks overpriced at 14-1 but Sunrise Ruby is clearly the right favourite. A better horse for stepping up in distance this term, she looks very handily weighted. 2.05 Doncaster Her last four runs have shown Freyja to be progressive, as might be expected from a three-year-old filly in autumn. Last weekend\u2019s defeat of the mud-loving Air Pilot reads well in the context of this. 2.25 Wincanton Meeting his rivals on better terms than he would in a handicap, Grand Sancy should give Nicholls an 11th success in this Grade Two. 2.40 Aintree A wind operation could help Ch\u2019Tibello back into the winner\u2019s enclosure. He meets Call Me Lord on 10lb better terms than when a length behind him in the Bula last December. 3.00 Wincanton It could be worth chancing Diego Du Charmil, who was only a length behind Verdana Blue on his reappearance, giving that one half a stone. Narrowly beaten in the Kingwell in the spring, he could have a fitness edge on his shorter-priced stablemate, Solo. 3.15 Doncaster It has not been an especially fruitful Flat season for Ian Williams but Kingbrook provided a highlight with victory in the Old Rowley Cup a month ago and may be able to follow up in the November Handicap, which the stable won two years ago. He appeared to relish the step up to this distance on soft ground and there is plenty of scope for this lightly raced sort to do better again in the face of a 6lb rise. Chris Cook Breeders\u2019 Cup preview Bob Baffert saddles three of the top four in the betting as he looks for a fourth Classic in seven years, including Authentic, the Kentucky Derby winner, and the fast-improving Improbable. The latter, from stall eight, looks the pick of his trio but Tiz The Law (10.13) has been given a break since finishing a length and a quarter behind Authentic at Churchill and can turn the tables here. A repeat of his win in the Travers in August would make 83-year-old Barclay Tagg\u2019s runner a very tough nut to crack. Keeneland 5.02 Gamine was stretched by nine furlongs in the Kentucky Oaks but drops back to seven here, the trip at which she blitzed a Group One field at Saratoga in September. Keeneland 5.39 Glass Slippers, the 2019 Abbaye winner, should go well if handling the track but has a bit to find with the local specialists. Oleksandra will get a strong pace and could outrun odds of around 10-1. Keeneland 6.18 Knicks Go improved sharply last time and could be worth chancing at around 4-1 to touch off probable favourite Complexity. Keeneland 6.57 Several strong hopes from European stables in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, including Terebellum, Audarya and Cayenne Pepper, but Rushing Fall is a top-class turf performer and should head into retirement with a second Breeders\u2019 Cup success to add to 2017\u2019s Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf. Keeneland 7.36 The unbeaten Yaupon is the rising star of dirt-track sprinting with four wins to date, but the more experienced C Z Rocket has been revitalised since joining Peter Miller and must go close from stall two. Keeneland 8.15 Kameko and Uni, last year\u2019s winner, head the market but this is wide open and John Quinn\u2019s Safe Voyage is just the type to thrive at a sharp mile. He drew well in stall six and 12-1 is a big each-way price. Keeneland 8.54 An outstanding duel in prospect between 12-from-14 Monomoy Girl and Preakness winner Swiss Skydiver. Marginal preference is for the three-year-old, only the sixth filly to win the Pimlico Classic, but it could be nip-and-tuck all the way up the stretch. Keeneland 9.33 Ryan Moore has opted for top-rated Magical over Mogul, but apparent Ballydoyle second-strings have won the Turf before and Mogul could be another. He beat In Swoop, the Arc runner-up, with ease in September, will bounce off the ground and has the right blend of speed and stamina for this test. Magical and Dermot Weld\u2019s Tarnawa look the biggest threats. Greg Wood"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
