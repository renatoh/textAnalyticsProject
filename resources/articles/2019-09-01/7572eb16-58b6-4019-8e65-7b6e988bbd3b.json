In the city where Andy Ruiz Jr stopped him in seven rounds in June, Joshua explained on Thursday why the rematch is not taking place at nearby Madison Square Garden, or Cardiff or London \u2013 and why he is comfortable going to Saudi Arabia. \u201cI do like New York,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was part of the plan [to fight in New York again]. That was my preferred option. The figures were amazing. I spoke to the team. The UK was a great opportunity, home crowd. I\u2019m about energy \u2013 getting energy from fighting at home, would have been good. \u201cThen the Saudis came on board, so there were all those opportunities as well. Even though we had more say in the contract negotiations, when we discussed it being in the UK, there was just stalling on their side. They didn\u2019t want to come to the UK. \u201cI was happy to fight in London. We weighed up the situation. Then [the Saudis] told me about Formula E, WWE, World Series Boxing, mentioned all these things [held there]. So OK, cool. But honestly, I wouldn\u2019t know enough about what was exactly happening to make it so bad for me that I wouldn\u2019t want to box there. The event they\u2019re going to put on, the people they\u2019re going to cater for, what they\u2019re trying to achieve through boxing, the reforms that are happening in their country \u2026 \u201cBut, since I was going to fight there, I had this conversation in my gym with two women. It is a point of conversation. And, the good thing is, they are talking about [reforms]. The good thing is they are going to make a change. The other good thing is Matchroom are having conversations about maybe having a female boxer on the night. The event is going to be mixed. They are making progress. These conversations are taking place.\u201d Joshua has been philosophical about losing against Ruiz and says he has a higher purpose than just regaining his titles. \u201cThere\u2019s pressure, being an ambassador for boxing, to be bigger than boxing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my ambition and I have to deal with it.\u201d Yet, for all his good intentions \u2013 and he does sound sincere \u2013 Joshua is seeking redemption on 7 December in a country where that concept is a nebulous concept. Human rights abuse, the slaughter of innocent people in Yemen and the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi also seem to have been no impediment to doing a deal with a regime so transparently desperate for international approval that \u201csportswashing\u201d, as it has become known, is a central plank of their public relations platform. This is not all about the dethroned Joshua. Ruiz told him when they faced off in Saudi Arabia the day before: \u201cThe hunger remains. I don\u2019t want 15 minutes of fame. I want it to last. I want a generation. I want to be a champion for more years.\u201d Ruiz will bring with him the IBF, WBA and WBO belts he ripped away from the then unbeaten champion at Madison Square Garden. It was Joshua\u2019s American debut, the moment that was meant to propel him into a mega-fight with Deontay Wilder, but their paths diverged dramatically when Ruiz brought his big lumbering fists into the equation. Joshua went down four times and a couple of pegs \u2013 although his stature and Sky Sports connection kept his commercial clout in place. \u201cYou have time to grieve,\u201d Joshua said on Thursday about the many months he has had in which to take in the full implications of losing. \u201cYou have to get over that situation and get back to the drawing board. We are soldiers. You just prepare for the next battle.\u201d That it will be in the desert of a country that has an appalling human rights record is the itch nobody wants to scratch. This is professional boxing. This is about money, not morals \u2013 because the business does not do all that well with morals. In a way it is the perfect place to have a fight: a long way from normality."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
