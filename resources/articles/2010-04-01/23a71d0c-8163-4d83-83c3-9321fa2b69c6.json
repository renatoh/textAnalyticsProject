It's revision time", "bodyText": "I'm back. Where have I been? To a bad place. I've spent the Easter break under \"house arrest\" supervising my daughter's revision. As many parents know, A-levels are looming and I can't tell you how stressed my daughter is. I can't tell you because it's not true. From what I can glean, her generation doesn't \"do\" exam stress. Why bother when your mug parents will do it for you? Certainly, I felt I had to \"guard\" my daughter, to \"patrol\" her, practically with a gun and alsatian, or nothing would get done. So there I was: getting her up in the morning in the manner of a raid on a terrorist cell; feeling unable to pop out because she might dump the books and watch Pineapple Dance Studios; looming over her menacingly, like Kathy Bates in Misery, just after she's rebroken James Caan's legs (\"Finish that essay plan, dirty bird\"). The lowest point came when I found myself thinking that it was a perfectly reasonable and sane idea to nip out to fetch milk with all the Sky TV cards hidden in my bra. What dysfunctional hell is this? Meanwhile, my daughter sat in her revision outfit (matted hair, pjs, hoodie stolen from a boy), saying things like: \"You're the only parent being so strict. Everyone else is allowed out.\" Nice try. Parent exam strategies range from sending offspring to elderly relatives, imprisoning them in holiday cottages or doing what I did, the \"Easter Revision Classic\" (ERC) \u2013 house arrest combined with threats, blackmail and bribes. And, if you're sneering at how pathetic this all is, then that is your inalienable right, but you are probably not a parent, you are definitely not a parent of a \"young adult\", and you're not aware that we seem to have entered the parent-carer era. Not all modern parents are smug micro-managing alphas. I could have done without Easter Papillon. Most parents would agree. But what hope is there with \"Generation Whatever\"? Never mind self-starting, there's not much self-continuing, or self anything going on. This probably explains the emergence of what could only be described as the reluctant \"parent-carers\" \u2013 the hands-on (who'd rather be hands-off) brigade, who start off as normal parents, but morph into crazed quasi-carers because the point where their offspring seem able to fend for themselves simply never happens. Michael Douglas who last week grovelled to a judge for clemency for his drug-dealing son, Cameron, tried to put the blame on himself and so is a prime example of a parent-carer. He clearly feels that he has ultimate responsibility for his son's life. Tellingly, his son, spoiled brat, thinks so too \u2013 why else would he still be pushing Daddy's guilt buttons at the age of 31? Not that our children are going to turn into Hollywood drug dealers. However, as I discussed with my daughter, woman to woman, with Sky cards sticking up, this can't go on forever and surely young people wouldn't want it to? Perhaps this is what we should be letting our kids know, to save them from becoming completely unable to cope. That, as parents, we can't just sit back and see them fail on our watch (and A-levels are our watch), but after that, there has to be a cut-off point, where, to be perfectly blunt, it's not our fault anymore. (Hahahahaha!) Otherwise, where is this going? While people are always banging on about dreading caring for their parents in old age, perhaps what they should really be dreading is caring for their adult children. Forever. Children who have been trained not to exude a shred of personal responsibility and are miserable because of it. I said a version of this to my daughter. I think it really sank in and we had a bit of a moment. Which is not to say that those Sky cards will be re-emerging from their special place any time soon. The doctor thinks you're an idiot. Next As a huge fan of The Simpsons' incompetent Dr Nick Riviera (\"The hip bone's connected to the\u2026 something!\"), I am always in the market for tales of medics gone bad. Enter Dr Henry Hart, a GP who's been charged with 33 counts of unprofessional behaviour, including aggression, swearing, sitting with his back to patients in consultations, making an eight-year-old girl cry and \"driving away\" 800 patients from his practice in Ulverston, Cumbria, with his Jekyll and Hyde behaviour. The case hasn't finished, so Hart could be found innocent of all charges. If he's found guilty, he should definitely have a rethink about working in the caring professions. Go for something more suitable \u2013 perhaps in an abattoir. Then again, I do feel a sneaking sympathy. I can hardly bear it when I have to fetch someone a Lemsip, so I could never work as a GP. Just imagine, you sit in a dreary room, while a stream of malingerers, bores, whiners and wafflers troops in, sometimes dragging children pulsating with snot, who insist on playing with the \"push the bead around the loop\" toy that's only there for show. Day after day, surely this would drive the best of us to misanthropy. Same goes for those Stafford hospital nurses who had the food fight. We indulged bread roll-throwing Hooray Henries all through the Eighties but a couple of nurses aren't allowed a break from the bedpans? If Hart is guilty, then obviously he needs disciplining and there is no job in the world that justifies making eight-year-olds cry. However, have a heart for medical workers generally. Certainly, some people aren't cut out to be good doctors, but some of us aren't even that great at being patients. How could Cheryl Cole and all the girls shatter my illusions? Interesting to see the richest singers under 30 list. Cheryl Cole is high (\u00a310m) but the other Girls Aloud are all there (\u00a35m apiece) and Charlotte Church comes top (\u00a311m). All this may surprise those who persist in imagining Girls Aloud as normal girls, probably living together in a flat, drying their tights on radiators. Likewise, Church (\"Charl\") has the whiff of the late-night kebab queue about her. Which is not an insult \u2013 these artists have pulled off the \"common touch'' and the \"faux-normal\". Another faux normal is Kylie Minogue. Years ago, I remember how shocked I was to see a photo of one of her homes (a leafy stately affair), because somewhere I truly believed \"our Kylie\" was living with Oz roomies in Notting Hill You can't blame the artists for people like me fabricating A Life More Ordinary-style backstories on their behalf. However, Cole and co should remember that, unlike the guys, they'd be wise to play it down \u2013 or they won't be there for long."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
