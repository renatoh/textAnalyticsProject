Temperatures in Qatar in summer rarely fall below 30C and routinely exceed 50C \u2013 wholly unsuited to football or any other strenuous activity. And yet, because the decision was crazy, it was also unsustainable. Yesterday the inevitable took a step nearer, when Europe's 54-nation Uefa voted to move the 2022 competition to a cooler time. It is now likely that the Qatar World Cup will be in January or December. This would coincide with the mid-season break that occurs in Germany and elsewhere but is resisted by football chiefs here. But the possible benefits? British teams would stand a better chance. The mid-season break might just become standard. And the usual tedious Christmas TV schedules would be disrupted. It's a classic example of the law of unintended consequences. Did we say Fifa's award of the 2022 World Cup was crazy? Correction. Make that visionary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
