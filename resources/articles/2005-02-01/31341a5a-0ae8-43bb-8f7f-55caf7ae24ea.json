He called on all managers and coaches to take more responsibility for their players' behaviour, criticising the tendency to turn a blind eye to incidents which favour their teams and calling for greater respect for referees. \"One [issue] that concerns me is termed 'simulation',\" Barwick said yesterday. \"Let's get real. This is diving. Cheating in fact. We've all got to show more honesty here. Every week referees are coming under intense scrutiny when making split-second judgment calls in this area. It's impossible to get them all right and everyone has got to take a greater level of responsibility. \"Players and managers may benefit when the decision goes their way but they and everyone else suffer long term: from the fans, the millions of viewers and perhaps most importantly the next generation of footballers. Respect for the game is paramount and respect for the referee is essential.\" Barwick, who joins the FA from ITV, where he was head of sport, said that football can learn from the mutual respect shown between players and match officials in rugby union. \"I want to see this level of relationship at every level of football, from the Premier League to the Sunday leagues.\" With his first day marked by allegations that Chelsea have tapped up Ashley Cole, his second will see him at tonight's Arsenal-Manchester United game, a fixture with rich potential for generating controversy. Barwick said he hopes the game will be remembered for the football rather than the fall-out. \"It should represent all that is good about our game and not be the subject of recrimination and revenge for weeks and months. This does not set the right example to the rest.\" With Lord Burns about to begin his review of the FA's structure, a process that will reveal many of the divisions between the game's stakeholders, Barwick also called for unity and dialogue. \"There seems from the many conversations I have had with football people that what is needed is sensible, mature dialogue. The FA has a responsibility to show leadership and we all need to work together to safeguard the integrity and the future of the game. I intend to do that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
