England can even look forward with a certain degree of hope after a spirited victory last night over a Tonga side who punched their considerable weight for the first hour. A quarter-final against Australia in Marseille next Saturday now awaits, and the defending champions no longer need view that prospect with complete trepidation. By the final whistle, indeed, they were starting to resemble a team who had rediscovered a modicum of form as well as their self-belief. Two first-half tries from the Wasps wing Paul Sackey, hoisting his tally to four inside six days after a double against Samoa in Nantes, gave them a handy cushion and there were also morale-boosting scores for Mathew Tait and Andy Farrell, the latter registering his first five-pointer in a union Test. A haul of 16 points from Jonny Wilkinson also helped the cause and took the fly-half to within five of Gavin Hastings' all-time World Cup record. The Tongans were far from disgraced as they departed the most successful tournament in their history. For a moment or two in the early stages they could claim to have ruffled England to the point where the greatest upset in the tournament's history seemed fleetingly possible. But they reckoned without a tight-fisted effort from the English pack in which Martin Corry led by splendid example from the blind-side flank. By the time Phil Vickery and Lawrence Dallaglio appeared as replacements, late in the game, victory was already assured. England had been braced for South Sea trouble following Tonga's bravura performance against South Africa last weekend, when they lost 30-25 in Lens. In the event, on a night more akin to a sodden Newquay than balmy Nuku'alofa, they stood tall in the lineout and withstood the inevitable Pacific onslaught in the frenetic first half-hour. It could not quite erase the grisly memory of the Springbok debacle at Stade de France two weeks ago, but Brian Ashton will be suitably encouraged. There will also be natural relief at having avoided being the first holders of the Webb Ellis Cup to disappear at the pool stage of the competition. Their opponents may have been preoccupied before kick-off with dyeing their hair leprechaun green - not that the tournament organisers let them, in the end - but there was nothing absent-minded about the Tongan equivalent of the haka, the Sipi Tau, which England chose to confront from approximately 18 inches away. The opening exchanges were feisty, too, with Lewis Moody's game almost coming to a premature end when he was poleaxed by the knee of the Tonga full-back, Vungakoto Lilo, as he attempted a trademark diving charge-down. There was a dizziness about England's collective early effort as well. Neither the possession nor the precision they craved were immediately forthcoming and Mark Cueto's fatal indecision cost a penalty, for hanging on, which Pierre Hola duly nailed from fully 45 metres. Wilkinson swiftly responded following a Tongan hand in a ruck but nothing then came of a fortuitous ricochet which fell to Olly Barkley in midfield. The Bath centre was eventually penalised by the alert Irish referee, Alain Rolland, for not releasing, and England, to their cost, were forced into another bout of heavy-duty defending. This time there was no stopping the former Newcastle centre Epi Taione as he crashed through his former colleague Wilkinson, and the centre Sukanaivalu Hufanga also beat two men before sliding over through Barkley's gallant tackle. It was just as well that England had Sackey and Wilkinson to turn the tide. From an eminently kickable penalty, the fly-half was astute enough to spot a yawning gap on the left flank of the Tonga defence. The athletic wing gathered the precise cross-field punt and touched the ball to the satisfaction of the video referee. Had Sackey's boot strayed a couple of inches further on to the in-goal line, England's confidence might not have flowered as it did. Instead they belatedly established a more secure forward platform and Wilkinson's 32nd-minute drop-goal gave them the lead for the first time, after Barkley had missed a similar effort from point-blank range. Another Wilkinson penalty stretched the advantage further before the moment which wrested the balance of power away from the underdogs. Tonga had been attacking with menace when a couple of loose passes in the England 22 forced a fumbled turnover on the far left at Lilo's expense. In a flash Sackey had seized on the loose ball and 75 metres later he had scored at the other end. In a Sackey race there is only ever one winner. The half-time score of 19-10 represented a far healthier return than England could possibly have wished. In their scrum-half Sione Tu'ipolutu, the Tongans had an ever-buzzing source of inspiration and after the break a full-frontal hit on Moody from the captain and open-side flanker, Nili Latu, shook the stadium to its foundations. It earned Latu a warning from Rolland, but no yellow card, and gave England a penalty. Wilkinson, who had a variable night with the boot, could not find the target. A few cheap points would have made England's job appreciably simpler but Tonga, as they proved throughout the tournament, are now a team equipped to give anyone a run for their money. It took Tait's quicksilver dart, with Hufanga lying injured, and Farrell's powerful surge into a gaping hole from 10 metres out to give England much-needed respite. Hale T-Pole's late try in the left corner was scant consolation for his side.
