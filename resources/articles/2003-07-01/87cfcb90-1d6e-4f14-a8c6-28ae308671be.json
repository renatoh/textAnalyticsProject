That happens tomorrow following today's stage from Narbonne to Toulouse, and Armstrong said: \"I have already reconnoitered the time-trial course, but I will do again on the morning of the race.\" Armstrong is taking no chances after his slip-up in the prologue time-trial in Paris at the start of the race when he decided against inspecting the course and produced a disappointing performance. \"It will be the most important time-trial of my life,\" he said, \"but in the meantime I will be spending time with my family in Narbonne.\" Armstrong, the four-times Tour winner, is the man in possession of the leader's yellow jersey, but Germany's Jan Ullrich, who won the 1997 Tour and is in sixth place in the current standings, just two minutes and 10 seconds adrift, believes he can haul in the American. Ullrich reckons Armstrong may be vulnerable to an attack in the Pyrenees and said there was a chance he could win his first stage of cycling's premier race in five years in the mountains of south-west France. \"If I'm on good form and I'm feeling good on the day then it might be possible,\" he said. \"The Pyrenees this year are tougher than the Alps and a lot can happen there.\" Ullrich is also looking forward to tomorrow's 47km individual time-trial to improve his overall position before moving on to the Pyrenees. \"I hope I can gain time on some of the mountain specialists and get a morale boost for the stages the Pyrenees,\" said the 29-year-old. Ullrich, who was second behind Armstrong in 2000 and 2001, thinks the American has never been in a trickier position going into the second half of the Tour. He said: \"Lance had certainly expected to be in a better position at this stage. In the last few years you never saw his main rivals just a few seconds behind him after the first mountain stages.\" Armstrong, from Texas, leads the second-placed Kazakh, Alexander Vinokourov, by a only 21 seconds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
