Four years ago, in a park to the west of the city, Fidel Castro unveiled a statue of John Lennon. At the foot of the fab one's feet is inscribed: 'People say I'm a dreamer.' Castro looked down, mouthed the words, and nodded: 'Me, too.' Poignant, perhaps. Weird, certainly. During the Sixties, the group was banned in Cuba. The play I saw, El Concierto, features a Beatles tribute group who used to hide their idols' vinyl in the record sleeves of Cuban orchestras, and to pay wry lip service to a party line that claimed the best Lennon-McCartney songs must have been written by Russians. Taken to Cuba by the enthusiasm of the British Council's man in Havana, William 'Eddie' Edmundson, and curious to know what of Cuban life can be experienced through its plays, I sought out shows that could be appreciated by someone who, like me, had only a rudimentary grasp of Spanish. There was plenty to see which leapt over the language difficulty by strong imagery, evocative music, or the urgency of acting and staging. I watched El Concierto in one of the liveliest small theatres in Havana. El S\u00f3tano ('the basement') is at the bottom of a block of flats - concrete terraces in faded pastels. The hero of El Concierto works in a soap factory and nicks the samples: this in a city where Westerners are often asked if they've got any shampoo tucked about their person; his bass player - in true old Eastern European style - trained as an economist but is working as a butcher. And the play's plot, the apparently improbable theft of the Lennon statue, reworks some real incidents. At the Parque John Lennon, Jose Luis Gonzalez sits opposite the Beatles bench, owlishly watching it through big specs. He's one of the CVP (Comit\u00e9 de Vigilancia y Protecci\u00f3n) guards you see all over the city, proliferating since economic blockade and greater poverty meant the island begun to suffer robberies: he's a Beatles admirer ('Imagine' is, naturalmente , his favourite number) and looks benignly on the fans who've spent the nights there with their guitars; he's there because people kept making off with Lennon's glasses. The weeks I was in Cuba El S\u00f3tano was showing the results of two years' collaboration between London's Royal Court and the Cuban National Council of Scenic Arts: they've been running writers' groups for emerging dramatists, encouraging plays (some of them about to get staged readings in London) which speak of contemporary life in Cuba. In the underground auditorium - or on the terrace outside during one of many phlegmatically received power cuts - an old Cuban dilemma was pictured, in the scene of a young couple torn between comfortable exile and the harsh beauty of home. A bravura portrait of an ageing drag artist - fading, colourful, crumbling, sad and proud - displayed the features of old Havana. Theatre is less constrained than some Cuban art forms. Radio is heavily vetted: anyone running an arts show has to submit guests' names for approval 72 hours before a broadcast, and isn't allowed to talk unscripted. Telly is suffering from shortage of money: Mr Bean and George and Mildred went down a treat, but Cuban soaps have dried up. The stage is a different story. Stand-up has started, and though the existence of what seems to be a Ministry of Jokes - the Promotor de Humor - sounds forbidding, some satire is squeaking out. Not all of it will travel: a recent comic playlet featured the offspring of a dollar and a peso who was suffering an identity crisis. But other work could: such as the coded drama of a play such as Icaro - which talks of labyrinths, an island and a longing for escape. Not that plays are always easy to get to see. Ever since the Special Period - the era of economic hardship produced by the simultaneous withdrawal of East European finance and the tightening of the US bloqueo - theatres open only at weekends. Then there's the problem of finding out what's on. True, there's Tablas and Conjunto. Both are unexpectedly sumptuous, but neither periodical is primarily for reviews or listings. The two daily papers, Granma and Rebelde, rarely run to more than eight pages. It goes without saying that they're partial: on one day during my visit, the three stories about Britain were that it was a police state (following a report of our massive use of surveillance cameras), that a pensioner had bequeathed \u00a31,000 to her bull terrier, and that Steve Gough, the naked rambler, had finally reached the end of Britain. One way of being sure to see a lot of theatre in a short time is to go to a festival. At Santa Clara, a couple of hours away, where half the taxis are horse-drawn and the rush hour resounds to the hiss of hundreds of bikes, I went to the Festival Nacional de Teatro de Peque\u00f1o Formato: a scaled-down, balmy version of the Edinburgh Fringe. In two small theatres I got a crash course in Cuban stage preferences. Cubans are crazy for puppets. I didn't see the national puppet, a rosy-cheeked moppet called Pelus\u00edn, who seems to have no Mr Punch wife-beating tendencies. I did see black glove-puppets performing a play about a slave-trader, and puppets big and small swaying to Debussy alongside actors. Children's theatre is big. These shows were crammed, with children sitting on their parents' laps in the aisles: behind me, one infant sat with her satin dress spread around her like a doll's; along the way, a nappied baby was being taught to clap by its mother. Students are keen, crowding out the open-air theatre where one of the biggest hits was a monologue about being black in Cuba. At the doorway a woman sold single sticks of Wrigley's. It's easy to think of Havana as naturally theatrical. Though the streets don't teem with plays, they shake with music, and the architecture of the old town, with front rooms giving straight onto the road, makes the city look as if it were staging a long, brightly lit sequence of scenes. In cigar factories, the tradition of workers listening to readings from novels or the press as they work still persists: when I went round, they'd just been hearing a Ken Follett novel. Cigar brands really are named after favourite readings - hence Monte Cristo. It's definitely a city of spectacle and movement. Cuban ballet has rarely been touched by politics; but even when peforming the standard Giselle -type repertory, its dance style is distinct. An expert explained that it's not only that there's a lot of shoulder-rolling and hip-swaying: the entire relationship between the male lead and the prima ballerina is particular. Russian dancers address themselves to the audience; the English dance like ice. Cubans always dance to each other - even if the plot isn't a love story. Even a form as apparently old hat as the zarzuela - Spanish operetta - offers its revelations. Cecilia Valdez, the most famous of all, is an over-the-top concoction: in colonial Havana a mulatto heroine is betrayed by the son of an aristocrat. But its score, which is magnificent and well worth a hearing in Britain, takes you straight into the mix of Cuba. It starts off as if it were going to be South Pacific , all swish and swoon, and moves into tango-congo, Afro-Cuban rhythms. It's the opposite of cutting-edge, and its songs are sung on the street. Watching it at an anniversary performance to mark a 65th trade-union anniversary, I got an unexpected addition. Before the operetta, an ovation: a half-hour talk from a man standing under the flag, ending in quite a lot of '\u00a1Vivas!' and '\u00a1Hasta la Victoria Siempre!' The audience, accustomed to listening to long speeches, took it quietly. As they did the show, where the most enthusiastically greeted moments, apart from the famous songs, were a bit of homosexual bum-bumping. The only time I felt as if I felt caught in a tourist trap was at the Tropicana. The songs are predictable; the dancing is too martial. And it's glum to sit among a crowd of cardies ('Saga party this way,' yelled the guide) watching tons of far-off flesh in spangly bikinis. But even the Tropicana has its beauty: the wonderful wide sweep of its outdoor roofs and stages. Two days before I left, I saw the source of nearly all the theatrical talent in Cuba. ISA, the Art Schools of Havana is a lost realm, an emblem of what the revolution might have been and of what it has become. Built in the big rolling parkway that was once Batista's old country club, and dreamt up by Castro and Che over a game of golf in 1961, the schools were set up to educate Cuban artists and instructors, and to act as an international centre, granting scholarships to students from Africa, Asia and Latin America. A 'new culture' for the 'new man' - given shape in a startling new architecture, whose makers considered the Cuban revolution as much Surrealist as Socialist. Domes and labyrinths of terracotta poke up from the lawns and palms. Classrooms give onto cool dark covered passages which wind around open courtyards. A dance pavilion is made up of a cluster of arches. The School of Music runs beside the river in a bendy strip. The School of Plastic Arts is designed to suggest both an African village and a woman's body. But everything ends in something crumbling or unfulfilled. Creepers drip into a shower room. Across the way from a small amphitheatre, a few pylons stick up from the earth, meant for an indoor stage that was never built. The bowl of a fountain contains rubble. Only a few years after they were built, the schools fell into official disfavour. Their architecture was denounced: it was individualistic, grandiloquent, too African, too sexy, and even (all those curves) homosexual. In Cuba a building has to be very ruined not to be used. In a subterranean rehearsal room I saw the small, richly imaginative theatre company called El Ciervo Encantado working on their new show, refashioning scenes from Cuban history. Three actors were improvising scenes in which a writer is visited by his muse. The author was wistful, with a voice like a rusty hinge. His muse appeared on a blast of Tropicana music, in half-mask, gold bra, turban, big shoes, with slit sleeves and skirt that flew away from her body. Hanging on the wall was one of the props: a jangling, brightly coloured garland made out of drink cans. The company takes its name - 'the enchanted deer' - from a Cuban myth which dates from the war against Spain. It tells of a magical creature which was forever hunted, but which always bounded away from its captors. Cuba centre stage The Royal Court's Cuban season in London begins today.
