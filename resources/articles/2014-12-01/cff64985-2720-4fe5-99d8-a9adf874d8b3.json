City\u2019s 2-0 win over Roma at the Stadio Olimpico and CSKA Moscow\u2019s defeat at Bayern Munich took Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side through to the knockout stage for a second consecutive season. Silva, who came on in the 67th minute against Roma following a six-week absence due to a knee injury, admitted he would like to avoid the three representatives of his homeland. \u201cWell, I prefer anyone else. I don\u2019t want any one of them. The later you play a Spanish team, the better, no?\u201d said Silva, whose side were knocked out of last season\u2019s competition by Barcelona in the round of 16. \u201cThey\u2019re all that good that, if you get one, you may as well get one of the others. It\u2019d be a difficult draw. Every team that gets through now, they\u2019re difficult. No matter who we get, we have to be 100%, and have to get a little luck too.\u201d Asked if City can claim the European Cup for a first time in the club\u2019s history, Silva said: \u201cWell, we have to keep getting better. We\u2019ve come through a very difficult group, a very difficult game and I believe the team. The last few weeks, after the win over Bayern, I think that match gave us a lot of life. The team got a lot better, got a lot of confidence and we\u2019ve got to keep getting better. Any team left can win the Champions League. That\u2019s why they\u2019re here. It\u2019s a long and difficult road.\u201d City have now won their past six matches. \u201cWe got a lot of confidence from that,\u201d added the 28-year-old of the 3-2 home victory against Bayern. \u201cWe\u2019ve kept getting better. We\u2019ve got very good players and that\u2019s what\u2019s important, that the players have confidence and give 100%.\u201d Of the game against Roma, won courtesy of second-half goals from Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta, Silva added: \u201cIt was very difficult, but we\u2019re happy and we got through because we started to play again. The truth is it was a great feat in the cycle of this team.\u201d Nasri\u2019s 60th-minute strike wrested the contest the English champions\u2019 way and despite the side\u2019s struggles in Group E \u2013 and at the start of the domestic campaign \u2013 the Frenchman believes City are one of the best teams in the world. Nasri was initially reluctant to be drawn on the potential of the team, saying: \u201cI\u2019ll let you judge it.\u201d But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll be biased. For me, we have one of the best teams in the world. We just have to show it. I think, when you go through, with all the difficulties we had, it\u2019s a miracle, with two points after four games, and you still have a chance to qualify. But we did it and I think we can go as far as possible. But we have to be lucky in the draw.\u201d Despite his side\u2019s rising confidence and the manner of the victory, Nasri understands that when the competition resumes next year certain variables could affect City\u2019s chances. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to talk about it. We don\u2019t know how many injuries we\u2019re going to have in February or if everyone will be at their best,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year we had the same number of points as Bayern Munich after the group stage, and everyone was confident because Barcelona were not at their best.\u201d City have not always played at their peak but are in the last 16 and only three points behind Chelsea as they attempt to defend their Premier League title. \u201cI just think you want too much from us,\u201d said Nasri. \u201cA week ago everyone was comparing them [Chelsea] to the Invincibles from Arsenal, everyone saying they were unbeatable and stuff like that, then it means we are not that bad. \u201cThe thing is last season we were smashing every team 6-1, 6-0, 5-0, but everyone has studied all the teams, it\u2019s not the same any more. And you have a couple of injured players and a couple of key players who are not at their best, so, you know, we just show that as a team we can perform.\u201d City are likely to be boosted imminently by confirmation of new contracts for Joe Hart and James Milner. Hart said: \u201cAs far as I am aware it is pretty much sorted. I leave it to the legal side to sort but I am very happy at this club and hopefully in the near future I will be signing that contract.\u201d Milner, whose current terms end in the summer and who had been considering leaving in search of more game time, said: \u201cThere\u2019s talks going on so hopefully it will be sorted soon.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
