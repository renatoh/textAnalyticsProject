The survey report, Primary Care Support to Carers, from the Carers National Association's (CNA) north of England region, found that the NHS is slow to respond to government initiatives to recognise and support carers compared with social services departments and voluntary agencies. The charity believes the findings are indicative of the entire country. The report - based on questionnaire responses from 23 organisations supporting carers in the north of England - comes a day before the CNA launches its election manifesto and ahead of the implementation of the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000. The Act comes into force in April and gives local authorities powers to provide services directly to carers. Technology problems and GPs' perceptions that they will not be able to meet carers' needs have been blamed on the poor response in identifying carers, says the report. The report also found that some carers are wary of being tagged by GPs, fearing the information may be used to judge their ability to care. Identifying carers - \"tagging\" - was introduced under the Department of Health's national priorities guidance in 1998, which required GPs to identify carers by April 2000 in a bid to ensure that carers receive adequate support. The deadline was extended due to concerns over the Data Protection Act, information technology and confidentiality. While some health agencies were embracing the new guidance - through carers clinics, staff awareness training and other moves - most were not, says the report. It calls for: \u0095 the Department of Health to issue prompt guidance to health authorities, primary care groups (PCGs) and primary care trusts on how to identify carers to meet the 2002 deadline; \u0095 PCGs to involve carers in decision-making; to set out action plans to address carers needs; and fund initiatives to identify and support carers; \u0095 the NHS Executive regional offices and health authorities to monitor PCG progress on carers; and ensure that postgraduate training and education addresses the needs of carers \u0095 carers' organisations to ensure that PCGs are kept informed of policy developments affecting carers; assisted in involving carers in decision-making; \u0095 carers' organisations to help PCGs find practical ways of identifying and supporting carers and understanding their needs. \"This study demonstrates that positive developments are taking place by primary care staff and primary care groups to improve the identification and support of carers,\" said CNA chief executive Diana Whitworth. \"However the progress is piecemeal with differences within areas as well as between areas.\" Both the British Medical Association (BMA) and the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) admit it is unlikely GPs will meet the government's target. Dr Paul Davies, vice chairperson of the RCGP, said: \"Most GPs are not making this a major priority, there's so many national guidances and imperatives, that meeting all of them, given the workforce situation we have, is an impossibility.\" And Dr Andrew Dearden, chairperson of the BMA's committee on community care, said: \"What is needed is a schools campaign, a publicity campaign and to get social services, the NHS and the Benefits Agency all talking to each other because it doesn't matter who identifies carers but that they are identified.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
