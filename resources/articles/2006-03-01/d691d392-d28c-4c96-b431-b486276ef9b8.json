Harry Redknapp patrolled the touchline he knew so well, looking proud in his whistle and flute, and watched a performance not far off nirvana for Portsmouth. Where better for him to get his first away success since returning to Fratton Park than his old stamping ground? This was a rampant and - unbelievably, considering their position - relaxed display from a team finding self belief just in time this season. Portsmouth's renaissance was helped considerably by West Ham's lack of enthusiasm for this game. With priorities firmly fixed on their FA Cup run, they just about went through the motions. But nothing more. Steve Bruce and Bryan Robson will have cursed through the highlights on Match Of The Day. Odds on Pompey taking a 3-0 lead into the dressing room at half time wouldn't have even tempted a gambler like Harry, but much as his team deserve praise for that, West Ham merit their share of the blame. A mass exodus long before the final whistle spoke volumes on both their performance and fixture-laden predicament. applause and a thumbs-up to all four corners of a ground where he spent so many impassioned years as a player and manager. Tellingly, the generosity afforded him by the crowd was extended to the home dugout, where Alan Pardew had, as expected, selected a semi-reserve side. The back four comprised the usual suspects, but midfield featured only one of the FA Cup team who saw off Bolton after extra-time in midweek - Nigel Reo-Coker. Alongside him, Yanic Katan was making his first start in the claret and blue, Clive Clarke his second. Of course, one man's rest is another's opportunity. But if that was Pardew's grand masterplan, it failed miserably. Quarter of an hour in, Portsmouth stepped up a gear and began to rip into their insipid adversaries. Andres D'Allessandro jinked into the box to test the alertness of Jimmy Walker in goal. It was the first signal that the defence in front of him were worryingly static and they paid the price a couple of minutes later as Matthew Taylor's cross flashed across goal for Lomana LuaLua. The Congolese striker cracked the ball into the roof of the net. Funny thing, confidence. Suddenly Portsmouth's players all wanted the ball. They were capable of scoring at any moment and Gary O'Neil could have done better with a marauding run. Sean Davis delivered Pompey's second goal in a sixminute purple patch, bundling past feeble marking before tapping past Walker with his left foot. 'We are staying up,' hollered visiting fans, who had seen their team lose their previous nine matches on the road. The home contingent grumbled and barked at Pardew. The FA Cup feelgood factor evaporated pretty quickly. Despite Portsmouth's cushion, this season's bitter experience taught them that it was still early to be celebrating and it was still all hands to the pump when West Ham ambled into their half. LuaLua tracked back to clear off the line from Reo- Coker, while Teddy Sheringham tried to breathe life into West Ham. If Portsmouth felt they needed one more to feel safe, well, who else to inspire them with a timely thunderbolt than Pedro Mendes? The Portuguese who assumed cult hero status with two contenders for goal of the month last weekend conjured another here, lashing a 25-yarder past Walker. Pardew, having watched his team surrender the initiative completely in an abominable first half, made two halftime changes. Marlon Harewood, the midweek hero who could not have enjoyed watching the understudies here, released some pent-up frustration with a thunderous drive against the crossbar. With 20 minutes to go, Paul Konchesky emulated that with his right foot from the left flank and Sheringham was in the right place to steer the rebound high into the net. The home cheers were muted. And short lived. Svetoslav Todorov tapped in Portsmouth's fourth after superb approach play from the excellent LuaLua. That rendered Yossi Benayoun's late strike little more than a consolation. Arguably, Portsmouth had the luck of the draw in arriving at a potentially awkward fixture at the perfect time. Handily, next weekend's opponents at Fratton Park have a Champions League game on the horizon. Any chance of Arsenal's reserves, eh Harry? Man of the match - Lomana LuaLua Despite Pedro Mendes' wondergoal, LuaLua's opener was significant in paving the way for this crucial victory. A goal and an assist at one end and a goalline clearance at the other exemplified his work rate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
