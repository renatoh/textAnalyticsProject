The European champions defeated Argentinian side San Lorenzo 2-0 in Marrakesh to add the global crown to their Champions League, Super Cup and Copa Del Rey triumphs. Sergio Ramos headed the opener after 37 minutes and Gareth Bale made it two as Madrid claimed their maiden Club World Cup title. The goal completed a hat-trick of major final goals for Bale, who also netted in the European and domestic cup successes. PA Su\u00e1rez breaks his duck Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s long wait for a goal in the Spanish league finally ended when he added to Lionel Messi\u2019s brace to give Barcelona a 5-0 win over Cordoba. After putting Bar\u00e7a ahead two minutes in at Camp Nou, in the 53rd minute Pedro Rodriguez set up the former Liverpool striker to claim his first goal in eight La Liga matches following his four-month ban for biting. Gerard Piqu\u00e9 headed in Barcelona\u2019s third in the 80th minute before Messi struck his 14th and 15th league goals of the season. \u201cI was able to score and that leaves me at peace,\u201d Su\u00e1rez said. \u201cI am a striker and I have to score goals, but I am helping the team win games. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t obsess about it.\u201d AP Dortmund in freefall Borussia Dortmund continued their spectacular implosion this season, losing 2-1 at struggling Werder Bremen. It was their 10th defeat in 17 Bundesliga games and sends them into the winter break in 17th place, just a point off the bottom. Davie Selke scored Werder\u2019s first goal in the third minute and last season\u2019s runners-up never recovered. Werder hit them on the break with Selke charging down the right wing on the hour, beating two men before delivering a cross for Fin Bartel. The result left Dortmund, champions in 2011 and 2012, on 15 points and they could drop to bottom place if Freiburg beat Hanover today.
