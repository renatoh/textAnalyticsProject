Lying in hospital afterwards, with a broken back, he said the freak experience wasn\u2019t pleasant but he was \u201ctrying to focus on the positives\u201d. That man\u2019s political equivalent in Australia could well be Josh Frydenberg. Only days ago the environment and energy minister had watched on as his signature energy policy, the national energy guarantee, was utterly rejected by his Coalition colleagues, like a parachute ripped apart by wind. It had left him with little except mounting pressure on another front \u2013 the controversy swirling around the government\u2019s $443m grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. For the ambitious Frydenberg, the ignominy was real. He had worked incredibly hard for months to design an energy policy that could provide certainty for the business community while appeasing the anti-Paris crowd in the Coalition. He knew the stakes were Himalayan, given the antipathy some of his colleagues felt for his project. But his conservative colleagues in the Liberal party rejected it anyway. They used it as an excuse to try to topple their leader, Malcolm Turnbull, complaining Turnbull was dragging the party too far to the left. Frydenberg, by implication, was dragging the party to the left too. If the conservatives in the party were now in the ascendancy, surely that didn\u2019t bode well for his ambitions. Well, on Friday, Frydenberg hit soft ground and bounced. From failure to bruised winner in a week. He emerged from a special party-room meeting as the Liberals\u2019 new deputy leader, having won a surprise ballot with Scott Morrison, who was running for leader \u2013 and prime minister \u2013 against Peter Dutton. He is now more senior than his conservative colleagues, and he had the luxury of choosing his own portfolio. He chose treasury. That\u2019s quite a positive to ruminate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
