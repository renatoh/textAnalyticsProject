A few years ago he helped put the roof on one of the gardens\u2019 buildings and turned up to a party earlier in the year. Anna Portch, 45, chair of the gardens\u2019 committee, has campaigned for the Greens but holds Corbyn in high regard. \u201cHe comes here and he\u2019s just great with everyone. He\u2019s helped people in so many ways.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a very friendly guy, talks to everybody,\u201d agrees Jonathan Gilchrist, 53, who has been volunteering at the gardens for six years. Even those constituents who disagree with his politics say he\u2019s likeable. A few hundred yards from Corbyn\u2019s home, David Charie, 72, is picking up litter outside his house. \u201cAs a man he\u2019s extremely nice,\u201d Charie said, sharing an anecdote of how Corbyn had visited a local school soon after becoming Labour leader \u2013 \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t get Boris Johnson doing that.\u201d But Charie said he had concerns about Corbyn\u2019s politics, not least his stance on the IRA. \u201cAnd this antisemitism thing doesn\u2019t seem to be going away.\u201d Indeed, it is the antisemitism thing that is splitting Corbyn into two discrete almost contradictory characters. To those who do not pay it much attention, he remains popular. To those who do, his actions have been unconscionable. Anna (not her real name) \u2013 who describes herself as \u201cJewish, until recently in a semi-detached way\u201d \u2013 has lived in Corbyn\u2019s constituency for decades and is wary of speaking out because of how her Corbyn-supporting neighbours will react. \u201cI follow politics pretty closely and was familiar with his schtick: I was never a fan, but as long as he was an unimportant backbencher I didn\u2019t waste energy on him and voted on national lines. \u201cAbout 10 years ago I noticed that his faction was becoming more toxic and by the time he was leading the leadership race in 2015, I was warning my friends to take care. \u201cThe five years since he won have been painful. I wanted an effective opposition to the government, who could win power, and knew that he wouldn\u2019t provide that. When I received rants about the \u2018mainstream media\u2019 brainwashing us against him, I said: \u2018But I was there, I heard him say all those things in real time, before the national media cared. I didn\u2019t like it then and I don\u2019t like it now.\u2019\u201d Corbyn\u2019s rise to national prominence has led to Anna developing what she describes as a \u201cwariness\u201d when encountering others. \u201cI felt sick walking down the road, seeing Corbyn posters in the windows last December, knowing that some of them were enthusiastic canvassers for the man, not just the party. \u201cThey saw the dangers on one side of politics but not on their own side. They did not see the dangers, not just to Jews but to all of us.\u201d Addressing this failure will be crucial in what Mike Katz, the national chair of the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM), tells the Observer is the \u201clong road\u201d that Labour now faces in rebuilding trust among Jewish voters. \u201cPeople who left will think long and hard about whether they feel able to rejoin. I think some who were active in the party may well come back, but that\u2019s separate from rebuilding trust with the Jewish community. We\u2019re at the beginning of a long road,\u201d he said. In recent months there have been signs of a tentative rapprochement. Three Jewish peers \u2013 including Lord Triesman, a former party general secretary who resigned from Labour over antisemitism \u2013 announced in June they were rejoining in response to Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership on the issue. Last month, Sir David Garrard, a wealthy donor who quit the party in 2018, told the Observer he would \u201calmost happily rejoin\u201d if Starmer effectively tackled antisemitism. And Laura Janner-Klausner, a north London rabbi who has remained in the party throughout the crisis, said she believed former members and supporters would \u201cdefinitely\u201d return. \u201cPeople will be extremely heartened by Starmer\u2019s response to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s comments. The natural place for Jews is always the Labour party, whose key values are the same as Jewish values,\u201d she said. Dena Ryness, a Stockport councillor and chair of the JLM in the northwest of England, warned that the feeling of many Jewish members and supporters \u201cthat they weren\u2019t listened to won\u2019t disappear overnight. People need to have their anxieties allayed and see action taken. \u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go. This is not just about processes, but about culture \u2013 and that won\u2019t change overnight.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
