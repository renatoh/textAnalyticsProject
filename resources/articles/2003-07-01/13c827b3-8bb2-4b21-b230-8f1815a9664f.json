Speaking to a convention of more than 500 centre-left leaders and thinkers in London, the prime minister declared the task for \"progressives\" - the new coinage which replaces \"the third way\" - was to fight both \"the conservatism of the right and the conservatism of the left\". But as the prime minister made his speech, opening the weekend conference intended to feed into Labour's third-term manifesto, he was attacked by a former member of his cabinet. Clare Short, who resigned as international development secretary in the aftermath of the Iraq war, said Mr Blair should pass on the leadership before things got \"even nastier\". And she accused him of manufacturing a \"great big division\" with the chancellor over Britain's decision on the euro. Back at the Dorchester hotel, the Progressive Governance meeting was told by Mr Blair: \"The next election will be a very simple traditional battle. \"They fight on a platform that is: anti-asylum and immigration, anti-Europe, anti the extra levels of spending, in order to give tax cuts to the few.\" It was the most explicit hint yet at how Labour strategists intend to fight Iain Duncan Smith at the next election - although some will feel that, with Oliver Letwin shadowing the Home Office and policies such as the abolition of tuition fees, Mr Duncan Smith's campaign is likely to be less rightwing than that of his predecessor, William Hague. In a speech which dwelled more on \"progressive\" philosophy than practical policy-making, Mr Blair did appear to hint that future health policy, as already floated, may include requirement on patients to improve lifestyle and diet. He said: \"Healthcare is not just the responsibility of the state but that we can affect our own health by what we do or eat.\" He continued: \"The \"one size fits all\" public services must be replaced \"with a far more flexible and adaptable system.\" \"We must never be defenders of the status quo. We are the change-makers.\" \"But unless we want the result to be poorer services, we need to address the balance between what the citizen pays individually or collectively.\" People must also be forced to take more \"personal responsibility\" in areas from crime and employment to health and education, he said. \"We must address the citizen's relations with the state; to tell them honestly that change is their responsibility as well as ours. \"That local schools are their responsibility as well as ours, that to beat local crime they need to help, that healthcare is not just the responsibility of the state but that we can affect our own health by what we do or eat.\" Meanwhile, in an interview for Sunday's GMTV, Ms Short said: \"There's two good years until the next election. We'll see how this plays out. I think the best solution for Tony would be if he planned to move on before it gets ever nastier.\" \"There is lots and lots of muttering going on because the trade unions are very unhappy, that partner of ours, and of course the degree of trust in the country has gone down remarkably. \"Now we'll have to see what happens, but leaders tend to hang on and what we mustn't have in the Labour party is a big nasty split. Ms Short, who has previously suggested that Mr Blair should consider stepping aside, insisted: \"I'm not in any plot for any individuals.\" She said: \"I mean, obviously there's Gordon Brown sitting there - and everybody knows he's sitting there - and he's a big figure and he's one of the potentials, but I'm not talking in those terms.\" Ms Short continued: \"I think it would be in the interests of Tony Blair himself and his legacy of the Labour party, and actually of the country, if he would think of making a voluntary departure and we could have an elegant handover and Labour could renew itself in power. \"And I don't mean it nastily. I mean, that is really what I think is in Tony's interest, the party's interest and the country's interest, that's just my opinion.\" \"It's a kind of hubris, sort of centralisation of power, in No 10 thinking 'Everyone else is stupid, we've got to force these things through'.\" Foundation hospitals were a \"complete mess\" and top-up fees were an \"outrageous\" and \"absolutely crummy\" policy, she said. The lack of planning for the situation in post-war Iraq had been \"disgracefully incompetent\" and the US was to blame, Ms Short said. \"It is the Americans' fault but Tony did not use his leverage, did not listen to the advice from the attorney general about what was legal, did not insist that British people would only comply with the law and he failed to use any leverage to get it right.\" He had indulged in \"half-truths, slight deceptions, exaggeration\" in the run-up to the war, she said. \u00b7 Tony Blair is to embark on a marathon round-the-world diplomatic mission next week, Downing Street said today. Mr Blair's official spokesman said the premier would leave for Washington on Thursday, where he will have talks with the US president George Bush and address a special joint session of Congress. No 10 said Mr Blair wouldl not be presented on this occasion with a special congressional medal, since a proposal for the honour has not yet completed its passage through both the Senate and the House of Representatives. From Washington Mr Blair, accompanied by his wife, Cherie, throughout the visit, will fly on to Tokyo, arriving on Friday evening. He will spend Saturday and some of Sunday in the Japanese capital before flying on to South Korea, arriving in Seoul later that day. Monday and Tuesday will then be spent in Beijing, for Mr Blair's second visit to China since he took office. The prime minister is also due to visit Shanghai, the commercial capital of China. The Blairs will then visit Hong Kong before flying home on Thursday July 24."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
