The complaint, filed on Wednesday, says the stars are targeting those who sell products accompanied by quotes that are \u201cfake and fraudulent, and published without plaintiffs\u2019 consent\u201d. Under legal threat are 100 anonymous individuals and entities who can now be uncovered with subpoenas. Bullock and DeGeneres are targeting those within the affiliate marketing industry who earn money if users click through from online ads to e-commerce sites. The pair used an example of an ad that used a screengrab of Bullock on The Ellen Show accompanied by fake dialogue about an anti-ageing face cream. The same company also reportedly used an ad of DeGeneres saying she does not need makeup because she uses its serum instead \u2013 quotes that were also fabricated. The complaint reads: \u201cThese companies change names frequently, merge in and out of entities formed in states that allow for secrecy, operate websites that pop up and disappear overnight, and generally do everything possible to \u2018stay one step ahead of the sheriff\u2019.\u201d The suit lists 40 beauty products that the pair claim have been sold with their names attached without permission. The affiliate industry will be worth an estimated $6.8bn from next year. Bullock\u2019s and DeGeneres\u2019s lawyers claim this specific part of the industry is \u201cbased on a scheme to trick consumers into disclosing their credit card and/or debit card information in order to enroll them in costly programs with undisclosed, or poorly disclosed, recurring charges\u201d. Lawyers are demanding an injunction and compensatory damages. In 2014, Bullock successfully sued ToyWatch, a company that was using her name to sell watches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
