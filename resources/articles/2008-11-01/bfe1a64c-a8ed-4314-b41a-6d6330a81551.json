The British No1 also revealed that he intends to work on his physical strength during the off-season in a bid to make further improvements to his game in 2009. The Scot won five titles in 2008, including two Masters Series triumphs, and appeared in his first grand slam final, losing to Roger Federer at the US Open, but managed to beat the Swiss World No2 three times over the course of the calender year, and also recorded impressive victories over Rafael Nadal and Serbian World No3 Novak Djokovic. \"The year as a whole has been awesome, Murray said. \"At the end of last year, if someone would have told me I was going to be No4 in the world, won the matches I have done, reach my first slam final and beat Federer three times, I would have taken that. I would have signed up for this year. \"I hope I can build on it next year. I'll take a little bit of time off now, work as hard as possible to get ready for the beginning of next season, try and put on a little bit more weight, try and get physically stronger and see what happens.\" Murray also feels that he now needs to find consistency in his game, and has to reach the latter stages of all the major tournaments in order to test himself against the world's best players on a regular basis. \"I won some really big matches this year against the best players in the world. Next year I'll try and improve on that,\" said Murray. \"But for me to play against them, now I'm going to have to get into the semi-finals and finals of the tournaments because of the rankings and the seedings. I just hope that I can do that and improve on a lot of things at the end of this year. Hopefully that will make a difference next year.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
