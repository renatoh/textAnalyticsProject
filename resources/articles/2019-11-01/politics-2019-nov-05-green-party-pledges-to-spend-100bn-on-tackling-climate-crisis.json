The key campaign pledge allocates \u00a3100bn to be spent on measures from retrofitting homes to new rail networks and green buses in the \u201cbiggest investment in infrastructure ever seen in this country,\u201d according to the party co-leader Jonathan Bartley. \u201cThis is transformative, and that\u2019s what\u2019s needed, as we only have 10 years [to solve the climate crisis],\u201d he said. Under plans to be unveiled at the party\u2019s general election campaign launch in Bristol on Wednesday morning, airport expansion would be stopped and HS2 scrapped and replaced with investment in rail electrification and local bus services. The target for reaching net-zero carbon emissions would be moved forward from 2050 to 2030. Bristol West will be a key battleground for the party, where councillor Carla Denyer will be seeking to unseat Labour\u2019s Thangam Debonnaire. Other target seats are likely to include the Isle of Wight and Newport West, where the party\u2019s deputy leader Amelia Womack is standing. Details of a potential pact among the Greens, Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru \u2013 similar to the one seen in August\u2019s Brecon and Radnorshire byelection when the Lib Dems achieved a 1,400 majority over the Tories after the Greens and Plaid Cymru did not field candidates \u2013 are still to be worked out. One complicating factor is the number of ex-Tory independents likely to stand in some seats. Bartley said between 20 and 100 seats could be subject to such an electoral pact, but experts predict the final number is likely to be closer to 50. Outside any pact, the Greens would field \u201cas many candidates as possible\u201d, he said. The party has only one MP, Caroline Lucas in Brighton, despite receiving more than one million votes nationally. Bartley said voting Green was not a wasted vote even under the current parliamentary system. \u201cEvery single vote for the Green party will shift British politics,\u201d he said. \u201cOther parties have to respond. Where the Green party has led, others have followed. We have shifted the whole argument and changed the agenda, making other politicians and parties change, too.\u201d Labour has come forward with policies for a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d, including a national programme of home insulation that Bartley dismissed as inadequate compared with Green party plans, and the Conservatives announced a moratorium on fracking at the weekend. The Lib Dems, Labour and Scottish National Party have called for a televised election debate on the climate. Bartley, who became co-leader with the London mayoral candidate Si\u00e2n Berry last year, denied that voting Green would split the leftwing and pro-remain votes and allow the Tories into government, pointing to Conservative-held seats such as the Isle of Wight. \u201cPeople are more and more willing to vote with what they believe in,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to hold their nose and vote for the least worst [party] any more.\u201d \u201cWhen you have people being arrested on the street in their thousands, young people leaving school to strike for the climate, you have gone beyond the constraints of this electoral system,\u201d he said. Bartley accused the Conservatives and Labour of putting forward broadly similar policies that would fail to move the economy to a low-carbon footing. \u201cThey are not offering change; this is business as usual,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless you have seismic change, we will not deal with the climate emergency.\u201d The party is hoping that its record showing in this year\u2019s local and European elections \u2013 which returned 362 Green councillors and seven MEPs \u2013 will translate into general election votes across the country and that its 50,000 members and the strength of climate protest movements such as Extinction Rebellion will galvanise voters. However, it faces an uphill climb; at the 2017 general election, the Green vote share fell from its 2015 level. Of the \u00a3100bn the Greens would spend yearly on infrastructure over the next decade, the vast majority \u2013 \u00a391bn \u2013 would come from increased borrowing. Bartley said this was sustainable because borrowing is currently cheap and the beneficial effects of the infrastructure spending would be reaped over decades to come. The Greens would to seek redistribute wealth to people on low incomes, offer a universal basic income to protect the poorest and replace complex benefits. It is also pushing for a four-day week \u2013 a policy that Labour is also considering. Bartley does not believe the current electoral system of first-past-the-post constituencies based on a presumption of two-party politics can survive, as it does not reflect people\u2019s priorities and the way they want to vote. \u201cThe old [two-party] system is dying under populist nationalism. The vote to leave was its death rattle, and the electoral system is on its knees.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
