The France coach Jacques Santini yesterday selected the centre-half in a 31-man squad to play in Fifa's centenary celebration match at the Stade de France. Santini has agreed not to select Fabien Barthez or Steve Marlet from Olympique de Marseille, who play in the Uefa Cup final next Wednesday, and will release a quartet of Monaco players - S\u00e9bastien Squillaci, J\u00e9rome Rothen, Patrice Evra and Ludovic Giuly - from his squad ahead of their league match with Bordeaux next Friday. A Fifa spokesman said: \"Fifa are very aware of the FA Cup final and all the traditions it involves but the centenary celebrations happen only once in 100 years. We would hope there would be no need for a major row over this and that a compromise could be reached in an amicable way.\" Santini has called up the United striker Louis Saha, though he is Cup-tied and is ineligible for the final. The Manchester City manager Kevin Keegan has been told there will be no cash available for transfers this summer but he still expects to confirm two new signings next week in an attempt to freshen up his squad. \"I hope to sign two new players in the next week,\" he told the club's website. \"They will either be very small fees or Bosmans, but they are both players we believe can take the club forward.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
