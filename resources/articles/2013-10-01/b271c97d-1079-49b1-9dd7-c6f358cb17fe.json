A further 81,000 called the telephone hotline when the exchanges opened on Tuesday, just as the federal government ground to a halt amid congressional stalemate over the same legislation. A spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services described the level of traffic to the healthcare.gov website as \"historic\". In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday afternoon, Marilyn Tavenner, the CMS administrator, said that officials had added capacity, improved the system and were hoping to speed up access of the federally-run site, which acts as a portal for 36 states. The CMS reported that the system was now \"ready\" and that people have been able to complete the application process and shop for plans. However, despite repeated requests, Tavenner refused to provide the number of people who had successfully signed up for the exchanges, or the reason for not doing so. She stressed that it was \"day one\" in a six-month period of enrolment. Speaking from the White House on Tuesday, President Obama said his new healthcare law is \"here to stay\" and highlighted the \"irony\" which meant that, because of its funding sources, the healthcare law would not be affected by the government shutdown. Obama said his administration would fix technical problems amid \"this demand that exceeds anything that we had expected.\" In New York state, two million people visited the site within two hours of its opening. The \"overwhelming interest in the NY state of health\" resulted in login issues, a message on the site said on Tuesday. It urged users unable to log in to return to the site \"later, when these issues will be resolved.\" A state-run exchange in Maryland also posted a message saying it was \"experiencing connectivity issues\" and asking visitors to try again later. There were also problems reported with security questions on the federal site. Although no figures were available for the federal site, some states reported numbers of those who created accounts. Richard Sorian, spokesman for the DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority, told the Washington Post that 1,500 residents created accounts in the first 90 minutes in Washington. Organisers stressed that Tuesday represented just the beginning of a six-month enrolment period. A huge public information campaign is under way to inform Americans of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act. For the first time, people will not be denied healthcare or charged more because they suffer from a pre-existing condition. The White House has named 900 different groups, from the American Nurses Association to local pharmacies and advocacy groups, that are helping people get through the sign-up process. Enrolment events have been planned at public libraries, churches, festivals, sports events, and community meetings. Coverage begins as early as January 1 2014 for people enrolling by December 15 2013. The healthcare exchanges include a range of options for patients to compare plans and find out if they are eligible for subsidies. \"We want consumers to know that they can find and compare options, check if they qualify for lower costs, and get covered,\" said Marilyn Tavenner, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. On Monday, Kathleen Sebelius, the health and human services secretary, admitted there would probably be issues with the websites, and asked for patience. She likened the inevitable fixes to software updates on Apple products such as the iPhone or iPad. \"No one is calling on Apple to not sell devices for a year or to get out of the business because the whole thing is a failure,\" she said, according to the Washington Post. \"Everyone just assumes that there's a problem, they'll fix it, let's move on \u2026 Hopefully, they'll give us the same slack as they give Apple.\" Sebelius said she expected \"90%\" of those looking to get insurance on the health exchanges would qualify for financial help."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
