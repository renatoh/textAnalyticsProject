The trio stayed behind to receive further treatment as the Gunners flew out to France today for their match with the high-flying French side. Parlour and Keown both have hamstring problems while Bergkamp is sidelined with an Achilles injury. However, Edu has been recalled to the squad after a groin problem and Freddie Ljungberg, who was rested from last weekend's game at Leeds, is set for a return to the starting line-up. Robert Pires is travelling with the squad but that is only to continue his re-integration programme as he recovers from long-term injury and he will not be involved in the game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
