The DIY ethic of the Jam and the Clash. When I was 18, I sent some poems to Paul Weller's publishing imprint, Riot Stories, and they published them. What was your big breakthrough? Getting my play Remember Me? on at Stratford East theatre in London when I was 19. I'd sent the play to about 20 theatres; Stratford East was the only one that wanted to do it. I realised later this was like winning the lottery. What have you sacrificed for your art? A career in boxing. I thought I'd end up being a heavyweight professional, but I packed it in as soon as I got my first play staged. Getting punched in the face turned out to be very good preparation for being a writer. Stage or screen? Stage, for the kick of having a live audience. If you write something for the telly, you can have 6 million people watching it, but you'll get just one or two phone calls \u2013 and one of those will be from your mum and dad. Do you suffer for your art? The only thing that's painful is the politics of working in television. The writing is the easiest bit. Then you have to deal with the agendas of directors of programmes, who are worrying about their channel's identity, or money, or their own self-aggrandisement. What work of art would you like to own? Hans Holbein's The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb. It's haunting, brutal and compelling. What advice would you give a young writer? You'll get lots of notes from script editors and producers. You need to work out which will help you write a better draft, and which are there to control and muzzle you. Has TV dumbed down? Yes. Commissioning has lost its nerve: everybody's scared of not taking part in this meritocratic craze for I'm a Celebrity and X Factor, and it's percolated into drama. There are only two narratives now: crime, or biopics of dead celebs. Authorship \u2013 being able to hear a writer's voice, the way you used to hear Jimmy McGovern's in Brookside \u2013 has become like fancy chocolate. What's the best advice anyone ever gave you? I used to write stage directions in which I kept misspelling \"discomfited\" as \"discomforted\". The producer David Snodin taught me to spell it correctly \u2013 I wasn't making a very good impression. CV Born: London, 1959 Career: Stage plays include Remember Me? (1978) and Raspberry (1982). TV work includes Holding On and Garrow's Law, now out on DVD. High point: \"Holding On. The last out-and-out British masterpiece on TV.\" Low point: \"Trying to rework the musical Blitz! with Lionel Bart. He'd realised he just couldn't do it, which was depressing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
