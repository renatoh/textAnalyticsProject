Murray wishes it were not so, as do Vallverdu and Berdych \u2013 but circumstance and history have collided. As for Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, whose arrival as Murray\u2019s main coach last summer to replace Ivan Lendl changed the tone and direction of his career, she is staying well out of it. Speaking for the first time about seeming contradictions between his version of why he split with Vallverdu two months ago and that offered recently by the Venezuelan \u2013 who denied there were any differences of opinion \u2013 Murray was keen to set the record straight. \u201cWhen everyone is pulling in the same direction, then things are going to improve. I feel like I made some big improvements to my game and physically in the off-season, and I think that has showed so far in this event. I enjoy working with Am\u00e9lie. I think she\u2019s fantastic. She gets on very well with my team too. She has a good personality to coach and also a lot of experience as well so I\u2019m happy with the way it\u2019s working. \u201cI think a lot of things go into that but, when all of your team members are comfortable and happy, when everyone\u2019s getting on and there\u2019s good dialogue and communication, then you\u2019re going to be able to make improvements. \u201cObviously things off the court as well have been good and positive for me. I\u2019ve got some things to look forward too there later in the year [with his marriage to Kim Sears]. When you\u2019re content with things and happy in the people you\u2019re surrounding yourself with and are in a good place, then that\u2019s a positive.\u201d He admitted holding a good vibe in a small team can be difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy thing to do, but everyone has to contribute towards that, it\u2019s not just up to the player to do that, the whole team is responsible for communicating properly and getting things done correctly. The tennis player\u2019s job is really to show up and give 100% in training sessions on and off the court, to communicate with the team how you\u2019re feeling and things you feel like you want to work on. \u201cThen, after that, it\u2019s really up to the team to put a plan in place and come up with the goods in that respect, to prepare you as best as you can be prepared for these sort of events. It\u2019s certainly not only down to the player. \u201cYou want to know that everything\u2019s taken care of. If one person in a group of four or five isn\u2019t doing part of their job properly then the whole team weakens because of that. So, yeah, you need everyone to be pulling their own weight really. When that\u2019s the case good things happen.\u201d Was this not the case before? He paused and replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly. Everyone might have different opinions on that but clearly the way things ended last year at the O2 [when he folded calamitously in his final match against Roger Federer] wasn\u2019t the best way to end the year. Maybe there were some reasons for that. For me, I think things right now are much, much smoother and calmer and everyone\u2019s a lot less stressed out than was the case at the end of last year.\u201d Greg Rusedski, whose analysis on Eurosport is invariably insightful, thinks Vallverdu\u2019s input will be crucial. \u201cIt will be one of the most important things because Murray plays on patterns,\u201d the former world No4 said. \u201cOn his forehand in his forehand corner he goes cross-court almost all the time, in his backhand corner with his forehand it\u2019s always inside out. His second serves are predominantly on the backhand side and the serve is short. \u201cSo, for all of those little key areas, Dani will tell Berdych: \u2018Be prepared for this at this stage, this is what\u2019s going to happen here.\u2019 When you\u2019ve been a friend of Andy and coached him for so long, you\u2019re going to know those sorts of areas.\u201d Another factor will be the wind, as it was during Murray\u2019s win over Nick Kyrgios. The Scot\u2019s artful manipulation of the elements comes from experience \u2013 most famously at the 2012 US Open when he out-thought Berdych in the semi-finals and went on to beat Novak Djokovic in the final. Thursday night\u2019s forecast is for 18mph winds when the match starts, levelling off a little later in the evening \u2013 so Murray has maybe a two-hour window in which to torment Berdych the way he did at Flushing Meadows three years ago, as the 30mph tail of a tornado swept up the eastern seaboard. Berdych, bamboozled by the breeze that night, said later: \u201cThat was a really, really tough one. It affects me a lot because I have a higher toss. When I\u2019m not able to go for the first serve, not making some points straight from the serve, then, you know, that\u2019s not my game.\u201d His all-court game suffered too. Many of his 62 unforced errors were ground strokes from deep that sailed wide or long on the breeze. Murray said the conditions were \u201cprobably the toughest I\u2019ve played in\u201d \u2013 the wind was so strong it blew his bag on to the court at one point \u2013 but he coped. As did Sir Sean Connery \u2013 just \u2013 when he invaded the press conference that night, well lubricated, and declared: \u201cScotland invented the world. Today we invented the wind!\u201d Rusedski agrees the elements will play a part. \u201cIf it\u2019s windy and blustery that favours Murray because he has a little bit more margin but if the conditions are calm it will suit Berdych as he can make a hole through anybody. This will be a major test for Murray. \u201cBerdych is an excellent player, he\u2019s someone who could hit through Murray and what I\u2019ve noticed this year is that he\u2019s improved his game immensely under Vallverdu. He\u2019s put a little more rotation on his forehand, he\u2019s more patient from the back of the court and tactically he\u2019s become more astute. \u201cDani is adding a little more tactical dimension and also adding more margins into his game and with the power he has, he\u2019s very, very, dangerous. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see both players hungry and we\u2019re going to see an explosive match that will possibly go five sets.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
