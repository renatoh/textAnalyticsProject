The private equity firm that bought the company out of administration for just \u00a35m described its shock at finding broken ovens, unpaid suppliers, and a leak in the roof at a key bakery site. Patisserie Valerie shocked investors last year when it revealed a multimillion-pound black hole in its accounts that soon sank the business. Matt Scaife, a partner at the Dublin-based Causeway Capital Partners \u2013 and the man tasked with turning round the business \u2013 said it was clear the company had been \u201cseriously mismanaged\u201d in the run up to its collapse. \u201cThings had been going wrong for a considerable time and as soon as we arrived the extent of the under-investment became increasingly apparent. There were ovens that had been broken for several months, and there was a leak in the bakery roof. Suppliers were often left unpaid, while new ones were sought. Overall, it was not a good culture,\u201d Scaife said. Scaife admitted that some of the corner-cutting reached extreme levels, including stripping butter out of key products. \u201cWhen someone decides to stop using butter in the puff pastry \u2013 in a patisserie - you know that something serious has happened. At the same time there was no head of health and safety in place, which for a food business is extraordinary. It was symptomatic of what was going on across the business,\u201d he said. Patisserie Valerie, which at one stage was valued at \u00a3450m, plunged into administration in January after it was unable to secure new bank finance. The black hole in its finances that precipitated the crisis has turned out to be at least \u00a394m. Patisserie Valerie\u2019s finance director, Chris Marsh, was arrested and bailed following the accounting scandal. The Serious Fraud Office has opened a criminal investigation but has not commented further. More than 900 staff lost their jobs in the wake of the collapse and the new company now operates 96 outlets with 2,000 staff. At its height, the chain that started life in London\u2019s Soho in 1926, had almost 200 outlets, employing 3,000 staff around the country. Luke Johnson, Patisserie Valerie\u2019s former executive chairman and its largest shareholder when it collapsed, has said he had no knowledge of the alleged fraud prior to October. Last week, he said he had been tricked by a fake picture of its financial health and questioned the rosy bill of health provided by auditor Grant Thornton. The chain\u2019s collapse had shattered his self-belief and left feeling him physically ill, he said. When asked about Scaife\u2019s claims, first made in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Johnson declined to comment further on the basis that a criminal investigation remains ongoing. Six months on from the buyout the \u201cnew\u201d Patisserie Valerie is looking much brighter, Scaife said on Sunday, with plans to replace the outlets\u2019 salmon and brown colour scheme and install a smaller menu. Scaife hosted a meeting of 140 key staff last week to thank them for their hard work in helping turn round the business. \u201cWe are delighted with the progress we have made. We found a lot of problems but we also inherited some great staff who really care about what they do. There\u2019s been a lot of hard work but it\u2019s very much back on track,\u201d said Scaife."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
