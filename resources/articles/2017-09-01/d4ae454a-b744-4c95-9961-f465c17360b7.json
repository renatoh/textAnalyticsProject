Abbott told Sky News on Tuesday evening the government had to address market failure by providing base-load power and building coal-fired power stations. \u201cIf we can have Snowy 2.0, let\u2019s have Hazelwood 2.0, and get on with it,\u201d he said, drawing a comparison between the prime minister\u2019s support for pumped hydro power and calls within the Coalition for a new coal-fired power station. Abbott said there was \u201cno chance\u201d that the Coalition party room would support a significant increase in the amount of renewables in the system, warning that Liberal MPs had \u201cextremely serious reservations\u201d about a clean energy target. Asked whether he would support a CET, he replied: \u201cIt would be unconscionable, I underline that word unconscionable, for a government that was originally elected promising to abolish the carbon tax and end Labor\u2019s climate change obsessions to go further down the renewables path.\u201d Abbott has been ratcheting up pressure on the government not to adopt the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel. His latest comments are the clearest signal that he would cross the floor over the issue, joining the Nationals MP George Christensen in leading a potential backbench revolt \u2013 although the government could still pass the policy if it reached a bipartisan agreement with Labor. The Liberal MP Craig Kelly, who chairs the backbench committee on environment and energy, said his position on a CET would depend on how it was structured but he did not rule out crossing the floor. \u201cThere is a real concern amongst a considerable number of us that if we adopted a CET in a specific format, it would put pressure on electricity prices,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is something we couldn\u2019t accept.\u201d Kelly believes the renewable energy target should be frozen for a number of years and increased more steeply closer to 2030 to meet Paris agreement commitments. Energy analysts and power companies have said that high-efficiency low-emissions coal power stations are not commercially viable and may not be until 2030 and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation has called it a \u201crisky investment\u201d the government should steer clear of. But in an opinion piece on Wednesday Abbott claimed the unviability of coal power stations was not an instance of market failure but \u201cgovernment failure\u201d because coal had to compete against $3bn a year of subsidies that give the renewables sector an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d. On Tuesday Turnbull shot back at Abbott\u2019s earlier comments that policy encouraging renewables risked \u201cde-industrialising\u201d Australia. \u201cI won\u2019t comment on that other than to say we have a renewable energy target that was actually put in place by Tony Abbott in 2015, it is legislated,\u201d Turnbull told 4BC Radio. \u201cAnd that is in place until 2020. What we\u2019re looking at is the future policy after 2020 to 2030.\u201d Abbott said that \u201cgreen religion\u201d had been allowed to trump common sense \u201cfor the best part of a decade and a half\u201d, including his two years as prime minister when the RET was legislated. \u201cKnowing what we know now we should\u2019ve gone a lot further than we did.\u201d He appeared to blame his colleagues for his decision not to scrap the RET, saying that when he was party leader he did not have \u201cthe luxury of a personal view\u201d but he had \u201cnever been a true believer in this stuff\u201d. Asked if he would scrap the RET immediately, Abbott said the government had to respect investments made under the existing system owing to sovereign risk, but there should be \u201cno further subsidies, no additional renewables\u201d. In the opinion piece he explained the government should try to legislate a freeze in the RET, even if it was blocked by the Senate, because it would help the Coalition have a \u201clegislative fight\u201d with Labor, not just a rhetorical one. Abbott said climate change was \u201csignificant\u201d but \u201cby no means the greatest moral challenge of our time\u201d, as it was described by Kevin Rudd. Turnbull wants to keep AGL\u2019s coal power station Liddell open beyond its planned 2022 closure but has shown less enthusiasm for building new coal power stations. On Tuesday he said a HELE coal-power station could be built in north Queensland if the LNP\u2019s Tim Nicholls were elected \u201cand the state decides to build one\u201d. Such a project would qualify for funds from the northern Australia infrastructure facility, he said. AGL has warned that keeping Liddell open for an extra decade could cost $900m. Labor has focused on lowering energy prices through increased intervention in the gas market, calling on the Turnbull government to increase transparency to help manufacturers facing rising prices and tight supply."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
