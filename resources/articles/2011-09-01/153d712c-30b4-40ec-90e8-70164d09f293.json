But one would be tempted to understand if they did. And it may be just a matter of time before they do. The latest challenge to the identity of places like the Lyth, Lune and Eden valleys, and the Orton and Howgill fells, comes in the otherwise innocent plan to extend the Lakes national park eastwards and the Dales park westwards so that they meet in a stretch of land around the Tebay service area on the M6. The problem is not the joining of the two national parks to create a continuous controlled area of magnificent northern countryside stretching from Ennerdale to the outskirts of Ilkley. That's a wonderful prospect. The problem is what to call it. Lancashire residents are unhappy about being placed in the Yorkshire Dales, while Yorkshire fears that its Dales authenticity is being diluted. Local arguments that have simmered ever since local government reorganisation in the 1970s now threaten the park unification plans themselves. What to do? Make everyone unhappy by creating a Cumlanyorland or L2D national park? Tell it like it is and dub it the Tebay Strip? The answer is surely to call it the Westmorland national park. Westmorland should never have been abolished. Here is a way for it to rise again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
