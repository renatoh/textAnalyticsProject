Some wondered whether, like the rapture, it would ever really happen. But they should never have doubted; for cometh the hour, cometh the man. The hour was 10.30pm on the first day of the new Premier League season, and the man was Gary Lineker, who had promised to present Match of the Day in his underpants should his beloved Leicester City win the title. When the pledge was made, it seemed as though Vardy, Mahrez and co couldn\u2019t possibly fend off their far more celebrated challengers; but as one after the other of the big teams choked, the thought of Gary au naturel \u2013 or nearly \u2013 loomed ever larger. It was as though MoTD had been reimagined for the era of Cheeky Nandos, top bantz and the striptease aesthetic of every structured reality show. As the title music parped to its climax, there was Gary, sporting a nicely starched pair of white Leicester City boxers, body impressively tanned with a touch of pink at the d\u00e9colletage, hair sharply quiffed and musketeer beard neatly trimmed. Even those famous ears were behaving themselves. Benches had been pressed, chests expanded. You couldn\u2019t help but think: bloody hell, 55. Behind him, Alan Shearer was buttoned-up, in more ways than one, though Ian Wright seemed happier to play Ernie Wise to Lineker\u2019s Morecambe; it fell to him to deliver the carefully scripted quip about not realising how cold the studio was. But, as we all know, the real entertainment takes place on the second screen. Over on Twitter, the forest fire of debate quickly began to rage: they weren\u2019t pants, they were shorts. It was a swizz, a BBC con, a terrible outrage perpetrated on the innocent and trusting viewers, who had expected nothing less than a royal blue posing pouch. As if we didn\u2019t have enough febrile conspiracy theories to cope with already. And there was more to come. After a couple of matches \u2013 including the collapse of Leicester at the unfancied Hull, with the commentator noting that their performance had been pants \u2013 Lineker re-donned the uniform of media metrosexual man: the fitted blue shirt and chinos. Shearer and Wrighty visibly relaxed. Viewers at home unclenched their buttocks. The British Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s flirtation with letting it all hang out was mercifully over. All of which leads one to the true legacy of Lineker\u2019s dare: what is wrong with this country? How far has it really come since Barbara Windsor\u2019s bra zoomed off mid-aerobic in Carry on Camping? And, perhaps more to the point, would this ever have happened had Gary not been quite so evidently buff and, quite frankly, up for it? Nevertheless, all\u2019s well that ends well \u2013 but let\u2019s simply keep everything crossed that England\u2019s newly appointed manager, \u201cBig\u201d Sam Allardyce doesn\u2019t get any ideas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
