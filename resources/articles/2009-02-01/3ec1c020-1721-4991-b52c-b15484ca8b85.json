Chelsea's accounts, released on the club's website to conclude a week of turmoil at Stamford Bridge, showed that Abramovich's subsidy of Chelsea increased from \u00a3578m in 2007 to \u00a3679.6m by June last year. The extra \u00a3100m absorbed another thumping annual loss the club made last year, of \u00a365.7m, following \u00a374.8m the previous year. Chelsea's wage bill was \u00a3148.5m and the loss also included \u00a323.1m paid in compensation to the departing managers Jose Mourinho and Avram Grant and five members of the coaching staff. Abramovich's sacking of Grant's successor, Luiz Felipe Scolari, on Monday, means a further \u00a37.3m will be paid in compensation this year. That instability, along with rising players' wages, shows that Chelsea accept they are highly unlikely to meet their target of being free by this July from reliance on Abramovich's fortune. Chelsea's chief executive, Peter Kenyon, nevertheless reiterated that aim , pointing to a 96% increase in Chelsea's annual earnings since 2003, to \u00a3213m last year, the fifth highest of any club in the world. Kenyon said this \"aim of self-sufficiency\" means that whoever is Chelsea's manager this summer will be able to fund signings only by selling first. \"Chelsea is building a strong business base in what will be challenging times,\" said Kenyon, who has repeatedly warned that Premier League football is not immune from recession. \"We have consistently reduced our net transfer spend over the last five years and will attempt to continue this trend.\" Chelsea had promised that the accounts would contain proof of Abramovich's commitment to the club, to contradict speculation that his interest has been waning. Those rumours were shattered anyway by Abramovich's brutal personal sacking of Scolari this week but the accounts are notable for a permanence in Abramovich's financial contribution. Previously all the owner's \u00a3578m funding was in the form of an interest-free loan, which attracted questions, and also criticism from the Uefa president, Michel Platini, and the FA chairman, Lord Triesman, who both expressed concern about top Premier League clubs' levels of debt. Last year Abramovich converted half of his \u00a3679.6m contribution into Chelsea shares, leaving a reduced \u00a3339.8m as a loan. Putting the money in as shares is a genuine financial investment in Chelsea, not repayable, as loans are, unless he sells the club. It is by far the largest equity contribution ever made to a football club. \"There should now be no doubt as to the owner's commitment to the club,\" said Bruce Buck, Chelsea's chairman and Abramovich's lawyer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
