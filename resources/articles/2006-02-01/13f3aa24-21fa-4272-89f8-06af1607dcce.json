Impulsive people appear to have lower rates of Parkinson's disease, while those who went to university are less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease, two separate studies in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry fund. But the study of Alzheimer's patients found the disease, a form of dementia, progressed more rapidly in those with higher education. The study of Parkinson's disease, which causes tremors and muscular stiffness, found the disorder was more prevalent among people who avoid taking risks and are withdrawn. Researchers in the UK, Australia and the Netherlands, suggested a person's behaviour could help predict the likelihood of them developing Parkinson's. They found people with the disorder scored lower on sensation seeking and risk taking behaviour and higher on anxiety and depression compared to those who did not have the condition. They were also less likely to have ever smoked, and drank less coffee and alcohol - activities which previous research suggests may protect against Parkinson's. This so-called Parkinsonian personality may be evident decades before symptoms of the disease develop. The Alzheimer's study, by researchers at Columbia University Medical Centre in New York, found that while highly educated people were less likely to develop the disease if they did its progression was more rapid. The study of 312 patients over the age of 65 found that over five years the memory of those who had attended higher education declined more quickly. For each extra year of education the patients received, there was an additional 0.3% deterioration. The researchers theorised highly educated brains were more efficient at processing information, so can stave off the onset of Alzheimer's disease for longer. But they said when the disease does develop the impact is likely to be greater than in less educated brains because there is a higher level of accumulated damage, which was not apparent before."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
