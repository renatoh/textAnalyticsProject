It was not a particularly good advertisement for Premier League football. The first act of West Brom's new Spanish manager was to inspire 45 minutes of old-fashioned, 1980s-style English huff 'n puff. Playing like this, West Brom should replace Zoopla with a picture of a cigarette with a line through it. It's not like the first half had been particularly scintillating, either, but it was certainly acceptable. Everton were quite good, scored a reasonable goal and deserved it. I wouldn't go so far as to say that West Brom clearly deserved to draw, but I certainly think that neither side deserved to win. So a fair result, then. Roberto Mart\u00ednez has been talking to Sky. \"Any point is a good point, but we are disappointed with the second-half performance,\" he says. \"In the first half I thought we were well in control. I felt a couple of times we got good combination play. Second half I must admit the condition of the pitch didn't allow us to get on the ball and control the match the way we wanted.\" A couple of further updates: Seamus Coleman felt his hamstring. \"It's not a good sign when that happens.\" It sounds like Baines will indeed sign a new deal, though Mart\u00ednez clearly can't make any announcements tonight. \"He's not just a player, he's a real icon.\" And that's all from me. I'll sign off with a couple of further beer-related emails. \"The finest lager player is the Crystal Palace goalkeeper, who calls his Julian's Peroni,\" chortles Joseph Chapman. \"Is it too late to point out that stones is/was bitter, not lager?\" pooh-poohs Tom Levesley. Bah. The wait is over. And not a moment too soon. 90+5 mins: And that's the last kick of the match. It's all over! 90+5 mins: Goal disallowed! Baines' cross reaches Barry, whose shot towards the near post was probably going wide before Distin diverts it in. He is standing five yards offside. 90+4 mins: Everton win a last-gasp free-kick right in the left corner. 90+3 mins: Brunt crosses from the left again, another good 'un. Berahino, though, clearly doesn't expect it to reach him, and when it does it just hits him in the face. 90+2 mins: Lukaku tries to dribble through West Brom's defence, then tries to bulldoze through, the ball bobbles up and Foster claims well. \"How many saves, actual saves, has Ben Foster made?\" asks Duncan Smith. It's pretty hard to think of any. 90+1 mins: We're going to have four minutes of second-half stoppage time. Four is the default number of second-half stoppage-time minutes, isn't it? 90 mins: \"Good to see John Stones on,\" writes David Hopkins. \"I like players named after defunct cheap lager, like Kingsley Black Label and Paul Skols.\" Um, Dimitar Berbat-hofmeister? 89 mins: Steven Naismith replaces Osman. 88 mins: McGeady has the ball, Lukaku makes the run, and at that moment the game is there for the taking for Everton. Then McGeady outlandishly overhits his pass, and Foster collects. 87 mins: Brunt crosses from the left, a better ball and just in front of Anichebe. 87 mins: Finally, a clear picture of Romelu Lukaku! He's the guy in the bottom left, I think. 84 mins: Mirallas collapses in the penalty area, but he wasn't fouled. 82 mins: \"I cannot put into words how disappointed I am that Anelka, when being leaving the pitch, did not kiss the Zoopla logo on his shirt,\" writes Joe McGrath. \"Missed opportunity.\" 79 mins: Anichebe plays the ball wide to Brunt on the left, and he thumps it first-time across goal, where it slides between Howard and everyone else. A bit of a Hollywood cross, that \u2013 makes the crosser look good, makes the crowd go \"oooooh\", but given the number and location of West Brom attackers in the penalty area, totally and utterly useless. Aiden McGeady replaces Bryan Oviedo. 79 mins: Coleman is off, and John Stones is on. 78 mins: Seamus Coleman is limping. \"Surely if you are going to overhaul and expand a Camp Nou you wouldn't call it 'Camp Newer' but something like 'Bare bones Youth Hostel Nou' so that people get the point that the existing facilities have been upgraded to something more substantial and permanent,\" writes Richard Hooker. \"Calling it 'Camp Newer' sort of implies that you have just moved your rudimentary shelter to a different location.\" An excellent point. 77 mins: Saido Berahimo replaces Anelka. Now the photographers will have to find something else to do. That was a super header. Not a great cross, but a wonderful header. An effort on goal! Hang on \u2013 it's gone in! A goal! A goal! Gooooooaaaaaaallllll! Morrison crosses from the right, and Lugano, wide of the near post, dives in front of Distin and sends the ball flying into the roof of the net. Lumme! 75 mins: West Brom win a corner. Howard collects. 72 mins: I have created this graphical representation of the second half's key attacking moments: 72 mins: Mirallas takes it, and misses the target. 71 mins: Everton have a free-kick, just about in Baines' shooting zone. 67 mins: In other news, Barcelona have tonight announced plans for the \u20ac600m overhaul and expansion of Camp Nou. So what will they call it now? Camp Newer? 65 mins: A shot! James Morrison shoots from the edge of the area! The ball loops very wide, and nearly as high. 63 mins: I actually quite enjoyed the first half, but this isn't up to much. Stay with me, though. I'll write something interesting any minute now. 60 mins: Another West Brom substitution, as Youssouf Mulumbu replaces Zoltan Gera. 59 mins: Baines passes the ball into the area to Osman, who loses it. That is all. 56 mins: There is not a whole lot of quality football going on. The most interesting thing that has occurred to me of late is the fact that Jagielka is on the same pitch as West Brom's French striker, meaning that we have both Anelka and, um, Anotherelka. 54 mins: Morrison's nice pass finds Anelka racing down the right, and his low centre finds Anichebe at the near post, but his effort deflects off Jagielka and bobbles harmlessly into Howard's arms. Everton break, at least until Ridgewell pulls back Coleman, earning himself a booking. 51 mins: Gareth Barry is booked for taking out Anelka with maximum cynicism as West Brom plotted a breakaway. 50 mins: Anelka's terrible pass to Morrison is rescued by Anichebe, who passes wide to Gera, whose cross finds Morrison, whose shot isn't really up to much, but is a shot all the same, so I thought I should tell you about it. 49 mins: Morrison picks up the ball on the halfway line, in a bit of space. He looks up, assesses his options, doesn't see any and has to pass back to the defence. Not a good sign. 46 mins: The second half is under way, and there's been a substitution for West Brom: Victor Anichebe has replaced Matej Vydra. Right again. Still no decent pictures of Lukaku's new haircut. So here's one of him with a hat. As the nation's sports photographers have clearly decided, his haircut isn't really that interesting. Diego Lugano is \"the slowest thing I've ever seen\", says Jamie Carragher, as we watch replays of Mirallas giving him a five-yard head start in a 20-yard sprint before scoring for Everton. And Jamie Carragher was no Linford Christie, let's face it. Unusual header of the day 45+2 mins: The referee's whistle sounds, and the players trudge back to their staircase. Everton deservedly lead, but there's still potential here for West Brom. 45+1 mins: We will have two minutes of stoppage time, and West Brom get them under way by winning a corner, and then hitting it over the penalty area and straight out of play for a throw-in. 44 mins: James Morrison has been booked, for an incident neither I nor Sky's cameras saw, but is described in commentary as \"a previous tackle\". 43 mins: A decent long ball and a decent finish, but that goal was all about the knock-down. It looks like Lukaku might still be decent, despite the haircut. Distin hoiks the ball forward from the half-way line, Lukaku heads it brilliantly into Mirallas's run from the left wing, and he bursts into the area and prods it past Foster. 40 mins: West Brom have been working up something of a head of steam here, though the final ball has been delayed, imprecise, or both. Vydra was just found rather nicely, but there was nobody waiting for his cross, forcing him to delay it until there were lots of Everton players waiting for it, one of whom cleared it. 39 mins: \"Is Ross Barkley being forced to watch this MBM as a recuperative measure, as a way of showing him how the players are perceived by the liberal press, or is it just that his TV is broken?\" wonders Confused of Massachusetts. \"Would have thought a protective boot might have been better treatment for him, along with some swimming to keep his conditioning up.\" He's probably not following the MBM at all, to be fair, but we live in hope. I can tell you that about an hour ago he was waiting for the game to start: 35 mins: Yakob's second foul of the match earns him the game's first booking. A bit harsh, as he got a toe to the ball before Barry kicked him in the calf and fell over. 34 mins: I've been looking for a decent photograph of Lukaku, just so you can appreciate his emphatic lack of locks. I haven't found one, though, so here's a picture of Anelka. 32 mins: More than a third of the game gone, and while Everton have been the better team, with Anelka and Vydra loitering the Baggies are an on-the-break goal in waiting. 30 mins: West Brom's best chance of the match follows Anelka's pass to Gera, whose shot has plenty of pace but not quite enough precision to beat Howard. 29 mins: Osman crosses from the left, Lukaku leaves it and Coleman arrives to shoot low, hard and into the legs of a defender. 28 mins: Lukaku finds a way past Olsson and hares down on goal. Sadly the way he found of getting past Olsson was to shove him really hard in the back, and play is called back. 25 mins: The last few minutes have mainly been spent waiting for Everton to take free-kicks after one or other of their players has been fouled in midfield. Ridgwell is the lastest transgressor, fouling \u2013 inevitably \u2013 Oviedo. 23 mins: \"I keep looking for Ross Barkley \u2013 how quickly a player can become critical to a team's gameplan,\" writes Gary Naylor. Barkley, of course, has a broken toe and has thus been forced to follow this MBM from home. \"Mind you, if Barkley and Deulofeu come back fresh for the run-in \u2026\" 19 mins: Wild cheers from the stands as the announcer asks someone to make themselves known to the nearest steward, \"who will be wearing an orange jacket\". The announcement goes down so well that it's repeated, in Spanish. 18 mins: I'm not deliberately only mentioning incidents involving Oviedo, honest. 17 mins: Another half-chance for Everton \u2013 Mirallas crosses and Oviedo half-volleys into Foster's hands from 18 yards. 15 mins: Here's a curious stat (though given the profile of Sky's Monday night match, Everton won't often have played the big teams on a Monday (except for bank holiday matches, of course), so perhaps it's not so surprising after all). 13 mins: Oviedo's tasty-looking defence-splitting pass to Mirallas is very well cut out by a diving Olsson. 12 mins: Now Oviedo shoots just wide of the other post! Lukaku picks him out with a ball from the left wing, and he cuts inside and tries to shoot back across himself into the near post. But fails. 11 mins: Baines wins and takes a free-kick on the left, and his cross is headed clear to Oviedo, lurking on the edge of the area, whose left-foot volley flies a yard wide. 9 mins: Brunt wins the long-distance corner-concession of the night award, with a misplaced 50-yard backpass that trundles wide. Nothing much comes of the corner, fortunately. 8 mins: Anelka released Vydra on the left, and he tries an outside-of-the-right-boot cross towards Morrison, which Howard does well to deflect to safety. \"Everton's season is over unless they can get a new striker in, Lukaku is finished,\" suggests Duncan Smith. \"For someone so powerful he has taken a foolish trip to Delilah's beauty salon. I didn't recognise him for a moment. He'll never be the same.\" We shall see. 5 mins: Everton play the ball early and long towards Lukaku, who spots Foster off his line and tries to lift it over him, first time, left-footed, from the edge of the area. He succeeds, but lifts it over the goal as well. 3 mins: The ball is played early to Vydra, who is extremely fleet of foot, reaches it first but crosses into the arms of Howard. I think Vydra is an excellent young player who has been rather underused this season, even taking his injuries into account. Cue 45 minutes of misery and an early substitution, then\u2026 2 mins: Zoltan Gera gets the ball on the left wing, looks up, sizes up his options, and then calmly plays the ball out of play for a goal-kick. 1 min: We have action! Pepe Mel is introduced, and walks out to great applause with the very epitome of a po-face. He forces a grudging smile as he waves to the crowd. What a grump! \"Simon, can you tell me why stories are written about players 'committing their futures' to clubs?\" pleas Peter McMurry, presumably apropos Leighton Baines, whose contract extension at Everton is expected to be confirmed imminently. \"Did Hazard commit his future to Chelsea in the same sense that F\u00e1bregas committed to Arsenal, or Rooney to United? It just seems meaningless, like a weekday match between two clubs that are neither serious candidates for relegation nor for European places.\" Not entirely meaningless: it was anticipated that United might bid for Baines in this transfer window, and a contract extension would make the possibility of a January move remote in the extreme, so it is a commitment of sorts, if only short-term. As for tonight, Everton may well qualify for Europe, and besides I'm optimistic that it will be a match worth watching in and of itself. The players are on the stairs! This is the Hawthorns equivalent of \"in the tunnel\" and indicates imminent football. Huzzah! \"Strange that Everton announce their team's official line up from left to right instead of the more normal right to left,\" notes K Ryan. \"Or is Baines playing at right back tonight and Barry on the right side of midfield? Yes, that is unusual. I think we can assume that Baines is on the left, whatever order anyone puts the team in. Here's the Press Association version, for reference: West Brom: Foster, Reid, Olsson, Lugano, Ridgewell, Brunt, Yacob, Morrison, Gera, Vydra, Anelka. Subs: Myhill, Anichebe, Amalfitano, Mulumbu, Billy Jones, Sessegnon, Berahino. Everton: Howard, Coleman, Jagielka, Distin, Baines, McCarthy, Barry, Mirallas, Osman, Oviedo, Lukaku. Subs: McGeady, Robles, Hibbert, Heitinga, Naismith, Stones, Vellios. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland). \"Pepe Mel is very clear in the way he wants his teams to play. I've followed him for a long time,\" says Mart\u00ednez of his opposite number, as his side apparently perform a kind of leaping hokey-cokey on the Hawthorns pitch. \"I think we know what to expect, and clearly Pepe Mel's going to have a big influence with West Brom. It's probably one of those wrong timings to come and visit a team with a new manager. \"In this league, you always need to be well aware of the opposition. But what's clear is that we need to be perfect with what we want to do, and make sure we can come here and compete. They're going to be full of enthusiasm and we need to be able to match them in that respect.\" Pepe Mel's first major call as manager of West Brom was to let a striker leave a team with a striker shortage. Victor Anichebe and Stephane Sessegnon have both been toiling with injuries \u2013 they're both on the bench tonight \u2013 and Shane Long has nevertheless been released to join direct rivals Hull City, albeit at a price. But in the build-up to the game Mel revealed the top-secret, high-level, audacious plan with which he intends to rescue the Baggies' season. \u201cMy plan is to win,\u201d he said. Excellent plan, Pepe. Perhaps the best, in the circumstances. \u201cIt is my only mentality.\u201d Certainly a very good mentality, although it was perhaps a little rash for Mel to insist it is his \u201conly\u201d one despite the entirely winless eight-match sacking-application that preceded his dismissal by Real Betis in December, however much faith he had probably earned with his previous successes there. Also ongoing at the Hawthorns is a hoopla about Zoopla, who shrewdly decided that failing to renew their sponsorship with West Brom would generate more publicity for the company than actually renewing it, and at a fraction of the cost. That's not to deny the possibility that the move was motivated by genuine moral outrage, of course, although the rest of the football world has apparently decided that antisemitic gestures are not so bad so long as they are performed not in the spirit of overt antisemitism, but rather in a spirit of friendship and support towards a convicted antisemite. A much-delayed decision on the part of the FA over whether to charge Anelka with anything is apparently due tomorrow, and in the meantime he starts tonight. West Brom fans can though with a clear conscience cheer a brilliant francophone striker, in the shape of newly-shorn Romelu Lukaku, who starred here on loan from Chelsea last season and may do so again, in an Everton shirt, tonight. He starts, and here are the teams in full: Simon will be here from 7.30pm with all the team news and build-up before West Brom take on Everton in the Premier League. In the meantime, here's Sid Lowe's profile of the new Baggies manager: The discovery of a collection of ancient manuscripts in a cave near the Dead Sea grabs the attention of an eccentric millionaire by the name of Cail Lograft, provoking a chase for the truth that will rock the very foundations of the Catholic church. Soon, the intrepid archaeologist discovers that he is not alone. As the mystery unfolds, even the Vatican is drawn into a dramatic, unpredictable pursuit that takes Lograft all the way round the globe with the Egyptian mafia on his tail. El Mentiroso (The Liar) is a blockbuster of a book, weighing in at almost 600 pages. At its presentation, the author described it as a thriller with a touch of Dan Brown about it. The following year, he unveiled his second novel: El Camino al m\u00e1s all\u00e1 (The Road to Beyond). Now, the author's bio needs updating. Pepe Mel, it will say, was born in Madrid, Spain, in 1963, and he is the manager of West Bromwich Albion Football Club. Mel certainly has a way with words. When his former club Real Betis lingered near the foot of the table last season, he publicly claimed that he would rather his teenage daughter announced she was pregnant than see his team relegated. Betis recovered brilliantly, while the remark said something about Mel's ability to communicate with the fans, creating a communion between stands and pitch. It also showed how much he cared. Betis, after all, were his club. In fact, for much of the past three years, Mel was Betis. He had played for them, was top scorer in their 1989-90 promotion season, and when he finally departed for the second time in early December 2013, this time as a manager, he had been there for three and a half years \u2013 making him the longest-serving manager in Spain's first division. They had come a long way together: he had led them up from the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n and into Europe, but by the time he was sacked Betis were bottom.
