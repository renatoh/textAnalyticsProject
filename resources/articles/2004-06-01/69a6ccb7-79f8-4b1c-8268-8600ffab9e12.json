The Spaniards appeared to be heading for their second successive win after taking the lead through Morientes on 28 minutes but Greece refused to lie down, gaining a hard-fought draw to build on their shock win over Portugal in the tournament's opening game. Both teams now have four points from their opening two games and retain serious hopes of reaching the quarter-finals. Spain settled first and deservedly led at the break after Morientes's classy strike. His former Real Madrid team mate Raul set up the goal after intercepting a loose ball from Michalis Kapsis on the edge of the box, back-heeling Morientes in for a confident finish past Greek keeper Antonis Nikopolidis. Greece's leveller came out of nothing when a long raking pass from the right by Vassilis Tsartas found Haristeas, who controlled the ball well and fired under Iker Casillas for the equaliser. The match ebbed and flowed between both penalty areas in an exciting second half, with Raul missing a great chance to put Spain 2-0 ahead before Haristeas equalised. Overall, though, Spain controlled the game and with Carlos Puyol and David Albelda outstanding at the back, Greece were largely restricted to speculative long-range efforts. For the Spaniards, winger Joaquin impressed after replacing Joseba Etxeberria at half-time, but Spain failed to capitalise on his dangerous crosses. The first half proved costly in terms of bookings for both teams. A second yellow card of the tournament for Georgios Karagounis means he will miss Greece's next match against Russia on Sunday, while Spanish defender Carlos Marchena was booked for a late tackle on Karagounis and is ruled out of his side's game against Portugal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
