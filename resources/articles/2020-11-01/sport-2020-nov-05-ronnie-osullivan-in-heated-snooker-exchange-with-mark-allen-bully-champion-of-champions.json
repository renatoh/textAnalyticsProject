Allen went on to beat the world champion 6-3 but O\u2019Sullivan appeared to be irked by the Northern Irishman\u2019s movements. O\u2019Sullivan was warned by the referee, Marcel Eckardt, on numerous occasions as he went over to confront Allen, who sat in his chair throughout. \u201cCan you sit still? You\u2019re standing up and walking in my eyeline. You are. Come on,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said. The official tried to step in, saying: \u201cOK guys, please. No need for argument, please guys, just leave it. Can we just play snooker? Mark just leave it, thank you. I know you didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d After the verbals, O\u2019Sullivan missed a straightforward red in the frame and Allen completed a match-winning break of 66. Allen faces the world No 1 Judd Trump on Saturday for a place in the final. O\u2019Sullivan claimed Allen was \u201ccontinuously\u201d in his eyeline. \u201cMaybe I read too much into it,\u201d he told ITV4. \u201cBut it seems like something you do down the snooker club when you\u2019re an amateur and trying to put them off. I\u2019m not going to let it go, so I pulled him up on it. No hard feelings, Mark played better and deserved his victory. \u201cSometimes you just have to say something. I\u2019m 45, I\u2019ve been around the block so many times I know every move in the book.\u201d He added: \u201cIt started around about 3-2 something like that, just little things. I thought I can either leave it, and that\u2019s why I was taking my time on certain shots. I thought I\u2019m not going to play the shot until you sit down in your chair. I could have said something then but I thought hopefully he will get the message. \u201cAnd he kind of did because he sat down. Then obviously when I was playing the shot he started ripping his logo off. I thought I\u2019ve got to have a word with him.\u201d Allen denied being involved in any gamesmanship and said the incident only made him more determined to beat the six-times world champion. \u201cTo be honest, it was uncomfortable for Ronnie, I don\u2019t know what he was on about,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let it go if he\u2019s going to make up rubbish. He was taking forever over shots in that last frame. Ronnie was completely gone and I just took advantage. Ronnie just tries to bully people out there. \u201cI just want to play snooker, that\u2019s what I came here to do. It was the worst thing he could have done, I was never missing after he missed that easy red. Sometimes he needs to be put back in his place.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
