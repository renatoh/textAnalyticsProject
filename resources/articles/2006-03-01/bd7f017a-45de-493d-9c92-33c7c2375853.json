Osgood, who died today at the age of 59, was nicknamed the King of Stamford Bridge. A striker of flair, imagination and superb touch, he was an integral element of Chelsea's reputation as the glamour club of the 60s and 70s. He scored 150 goals in 380 appearances for the Blues, netting two on his debut in a League Cup tie against Workington at the age of 17. Osgood's contribution helped the club to memorable victories on big occasions - he was in the team that won the 1970 FA Cup (he scored in every round) and lifted the European Cup Winners' Cup against Real Madrid the following year. The striker made four appearances for England, being called up to the 1970 World Cup squad, and later played for Southampton, with whom he won another FA Cup in 1976 (read his Small Talk interview on Guardian Unlimited Football here), and - briefly - Norwich City. His Chelsea team-mate Ron Harris said Osgood, who collapsed and died as he attended a family funeral in Slough, was the greatest player the London club had ever had. \"He was such a strong player, a big fellow who scored goals and scared defenders,\" he said. \"There is no modern-day comparison to him - he played at a time where defenders were so ruthless, but still scored fantastic goals.\" A statement on Chelsea's official website said: \"Affection and esteem for the man the fans titled the King of Stamford Bridge could not be higher. Today is a very sad day indeed.\" At a time of debate about the style and methods favoured by the current-day Chelsea - are they ruthless winners or merely an advert for the dull and cynical? - the team that featured Osgood, Harris, Alan Hudson and goalkeeper Peter Bonetti has found itself the subject of some (very) favourable comparisons. Osgood's early death will bring back more memories of the often swashbuckling way in which he and his colleagues approached the game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
