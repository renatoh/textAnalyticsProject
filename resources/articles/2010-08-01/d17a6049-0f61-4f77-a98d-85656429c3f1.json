London Irish's Toby Booth believes the higher budgets of the top French sides gives them a huge advantage and hinted that the domestic league would be the Exiles' priority. \"If you look at the squad sizes in general, the ability for teams to fight consistently on two fronts has changed,\" Booth said. \"It's not just us, it's everyone. We had a chuckle about operation budgets in France compared to England. Bayonne have increased their budget by \u20ac4.3m (\u00a33.52m). They have increased it by the same amount as the wage cap we work under. Sometimes we don't have options to rotate players, sometimes you're struggling to get a team out. That puts pressure on the players, staff, management and the club itself.\" Irish will go into the season with a senior squad of 32 players. Toulon, in contrast, have 49 players on their books and the Exiles' defence coach Dave Ellis, who has worked for years in France, is keenly aware of the gulf in resources. \"If you look at Toulon and Racing M\u00e9tro, with the number of players they have in their squad, they can play one side in the Top 14 and have another team to play in the Heineken Cup.\" Even newly promoted Agen have a playing budget for this season of \u20ac9m (\u00a37.37m). Booth, however, is determined to ensure that Irish punch their weight this season and has installed a new captain in the Kiwi prop Clarke Dermody. \"Freshness in your approach is important,\" Booth said, stressing that Bob Casey would still lead the team on occasion. \"Bob has been fantastic in what he has done for us in a successful period but we have become reliant on one leader. We need as many leaders on the pitch as possible, all of them leading by example.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
