Arsenal's manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who was in Monaco with Campbell for yesterday's grand prix, is a big admirer of the 26-year-old and hopes the combination of Champions League football and the opportunity to stay in London will persuade him to move to Highbury. Campbell is understood to have held talks with Arsenal and must decide whether he is willing to switch to Spurs' greatest rivals. The move would satisfy his desire to play in \"the major European club competitions sooner rather than later\", which he cited as his reason for leaving White Hart Lane. With Tony Adams planning to retire at the end of next season and Martin Keown almost 35, Wenger's need for a top-quality centre-back is plain. However, Manchester United and Liverpool are also interested and Campbell could choose to move abroad, with Barcelona and Internazionale among his options. Tottenham admitted defeat in their attempt to keep him on Saturday night, saying his demands, which included \u00a3128,000 a week, were \"unacceptable\" and inflexible. \"Campbell has demanded a \u00a320m three-year deal including a clause that he can walk away from the club as a free agent if we fail to achieve a Champions League place by the end of next season,\" the club said. Spurs had offered \u00a380,000 a week, the biggest contract in the Premiership. Campbell said that leaving the club he has served whole-heartedly since he joined as a trainee in 1991 was the \"hardest decision\" of his career and was based \"purely on football\" as he sought regular European action at his peak. Spurs, though, suggested finance was the crucial aspect and expressed disappointment that the matter was \"not resolved six months ago when Sol Campbell stated his decision was not about money\". The vice-chairman David Buchler described Campbell's wage demands as \"ridiculous\" and added: \"We need to build a team that is absolutely committed to the future rather than to the monetary side.\" The loss of Campbell overshadowed the arrival of Teddy Sheringham on a free transfer from Manchester United, from whom Tottenham also hope to sign the England under-21 forward Jonathan Greening. At Old Trafford, Sir Alex Ferguson plans to increase his French contingent with the arrival of three high-profile summer signings - Patrick Vieira from Arsenal, Bixente Lizarazu from Bayern Munich and a remarkable return for Eric Cantona. Ferguson expects to conclude the \u00a37m signing of the 31-year-old Lizarazu within the next week - \"he is very keen to join us as soon as possible\" - and has confirmed that he may make a British-record \u00a324m offer for Vieira. He also plans to entice Cantona back with a coaching role. Four years after retiring, Cantona is mulling over an offer to work part-time with the United youth team, and the indications yesterday were that he was close to accepting. Ferguson admitted to making unsuccessful attempts to sign Zinedine Zidane from Juventus and clearly believes that, despite his differences with the board, he has their backing to continue spending. Arsenal will try to prevent Vieira joining United but Ferguson, who said he had not yet made an official offer, is encouraged by reports that the midfielder is unsettled. Talks are under way with Vieira's advisers. The arrival of Lizarazu is likely to precipitate the departure of United's longest-serving player, Denis Irwin. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
