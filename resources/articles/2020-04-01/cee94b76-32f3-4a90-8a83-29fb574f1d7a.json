It\u2019s no time for a pile-on. If that 70-footer on 14 had dropped ... if that chip for eagle on 15 went in ... yeah, yeah, your auntie and uncle. But we\u2019re talking the combined width of a couple of dimples here; it wouldn\u2019t have taken too much to shift the momentum. Sure, you can\u2019t deny the scale and scope of the collapse ... but things are never totally black and white, and it\u2019d be dreadful if history forgets how Norman nearly pulled it back round when his dreams were crumbling. Just as it\u2019d be an outrage if Faldo\u2019s 67 doesn\u2019t go down as one of the great final rounds in the entire history of championship golf, one of the carpe-diem performances. Faldo\u2019s been pretty good at those over the years, you know. -12: Nick Faldo -7: Greg Norman -6: Phil Mickelson -5: Frank Nobilo -4: Scott Hoch, Duffy Waldorf -3: Davis Love III, Jeff Maggert, Corey Pavin -2: David Frost, Scott McCarron Anyway, thanks for reading. Join us tomorrow afternoon, 34 years ago in 1986, for more space/time continuum-bending Masters action! But take nothing away from Nick Faldo, who now joins Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead and Gary Player as a three-time Masters champion. That\u2019s some exalted company; only Arnold Palmer (four) and Jack Nicklaus (six) have won more. Throw in his three Opens, and that\u2019s a total of six majors, putting him up there on the all-time list alongside Lee Trevino, and ahead of the likes of Byron Nelson, Peter Thomson and Seve! Faldo never seems to get the credit he deserves for his brilliance, his talent, his street-fighting moxie. And no doubt today\u2019s 67 will become another example of that trend, eclipsed by the Norman psychodrama. But what a final round! Six birdies today, and a serene swing around Amen Corner, not a single bat of the eyelid as he traversed the most notoriously mind-bending stretch in major-championship golf. What a golfer! What a champion! England\u2019s greatest sporting star of all time? He\u2019s got a claim. How to process all that? The top line will be Norman\u2019s collapse. There\u2019s no option. It just has to be. This morning, it looked like his 15-year quest for that elusive green coat would end. The ghost of Larry Mize, in particular, would be banished forever. But once again, the Great White Shark came so close, yet remains so far, having found yet another spectacular way to come a cropper in a major. The yearning goes on. You\u2019d like to think he\u2019ll come back and win this Tournament another day, but at 41 years old, this may well have been his last chance. Heartbreaking. Greg and the Masters: one of golf\u2019s great unrequited love stories. Speaking of Greg, he\u2019s just come out of the scorers\u2019 tent. Here\u2019s his hot take: \u201cI haven\u2019t had chance to think about it. I didn\u2019t play as well as I\u2019d have liked, I didn\u2019t putt very well today, it\u2019s just one of those things. Things just didn\u2019t go my way. Nick played a great round, he played very solid and steady, and it was all my mistakes.\u201d Back in the Butler Cabin, last year\u2019s champion Ben Crenshaw helps Faldo on with his third green jacket. The new champ quips: \u201cI putted like you for a change!\u201d Gentle Ben smiles back: \u201cYou played fantastic!\u201d When did he begin to realise this could be on? \u201cGreg bogeyed 10 and really that was a bit of momentum. And then after that it was hitting clutch shots. I had the honour on 12, and that was key. The good old match-play strategy, get it on first, and I hit a very good shot there. And I hit a good 2-iron on 13, I was very pleased with that shot. Greg was still in it, and we both hit good chips on 15. And then the last three holes, we all know what happened, so there you go. I swallowed hard, breathed harder, that was the situation, now it was mine to lose. So I had to put my head down and grind. I\u2019m delighted the way I\u2019ve played the back nine today. I was able to enjoy it [walking up 18] but enjoy it in a strange way. I was trying to enjoy it, but I do feel sorry for Greg.\u201d That refrain again. Faldo often gets undue pelters for perceived coldness, but he\u2019s been magnanimous in victory today. A masterclass in sportsmanship and humanity. Here\u2019s Faldo in the Butler Cabin for the third time! No amateur in attendance at the ceremony this year, with none of them making the cut, not even last year\u2019s much-heralded low amateur Tiger Woods. A flash in the pan? Oh Tiger, we hardly knew ye! Anyway, Faldo looks exhausted physically, and sounds exhausted mentally, his sympathy for Norman evident in pretty much every word. \u201cI went out to do what I ended up doing, shoot a 65, 66, 67. But I genuinely feel sorry for Greg. He\u2019s a great man. In a way it\u2019s a credit to the Masters, for what you put us through. It\u2019s the most nerve-wracking golf course in the world. We have to play the most precise golf under the most extreme pressures, and so I\u2019ve come out great, but I do feel sorry for Greg.\u201d Faldo raises both arms in the air triumphantly, spinning around, putter aloft, scarcely able to comprehend the events of this afternoon. He hugs his caddy Fanny Sunesson, then she departs the scene with the 18th flagstick over her shoulder, a souvenir sourced and secured. That leaves the stage for Norman and Faldo to embrace. And it\u2019s a true embrace, bittersweet but warm, both men fully aware of the historic importance and emotional implications of this wild final round. Norman appears genuinely happy for Faldo, offering hearty congratulations and a kind smile; Faldo a strange mixture of ecstasy and wish-I-could-have-won-it-another-way concern for his opponent. The brotherhood of golfers right there. They walk off the green arm in arm, and Norman pats Faldo softly on the tummy, each friendly slap saying well done, old boy. Such a sporting response from Greg, who exits with supreme dignity, even though his eyes betray his heartbreak. The man with the child in his eyes. Poor baby Shark. It\u2019s Faldo\u2019s moment. Without so much as a microgram of pressure weighing on his shoulders, he teases in his right-to-left slider, and he finishes in style! A birdie and a truly wonderful 67! NICK FALDO IS THE 1996 MASTERS CHAMPION! -12: Faldo (F) -7: Norman (F) Two putts from the fringe for par, and at least Norman has avoided the further indignity of giving up sole ownership of second place. He raises one arm in the air to thank the gallery for their love, support and - sorry to say, because no world-class sports star wants this - sympathy. His heart\u2019s broken. He\u2019ll most likely never wear a green jacket now. But he still manages a smile and a tip of the hat. A six-over 78 today, though, goodness. Only three days ago, he tore round here in a course-record-equalling 63. This is why we all love and hate golf, in equal measure, often at the same time. Even the greats struggle to work it out sometimes. Norman wedges in from 120 yards or so. It\u2019s of similar standard to much that\u2019s gone before it. Pushed right and short, stopping on the fringe. And so both players make the walk up 18. The gallery showers the pair with applause. Norman arrives first, letting the champion-elect savour his moment as he walks up last. He\u2019s able to soak it in this time; his first two victories required play-offs, but this one\u2019s all done and dusted. A slight sadness hangs in the air, though, which is a shame for Faldo and no reflection on the 38-year-old Englishman. It\u2019s just that Norman\u2019s collapse has been through-the-fingers distressing, and many turned up today in expectation of seeing one of the most popular players in the world claim the prize he so longs for. It\u2019s just the way it is. Faldo attempts to replicate Lyle\u2019s famous bunker shot from 130 yards. It\u2019s not quite as delightful as one of the greatest shots in Masters history, but that\u2019s a hell of a high bar, and it\u2019s pretty darn good on its own terms, sent into the heart of the green, the ridge across the middle bringing the ball back to 20 feet. He\u2019ll have a good look at birdie. Faldo, full to the brim with adrenaline, booms his drive at 18 into Lyle\u2019s bunker. Norman finds the fairway by the dogleg. He couldn\u2019t have placed his ball any better. It\u2019s not often he\u2019s been able to say that this afternoon. Oh Greg. Meanwhile Faldo and Norman are both on 17 in fuss-free regulation. A genuine sense that, if both men could pick up and walk back to the clubhouse now, they would. Probably best to let Norman spend some time alone. A garden-variety par for Faldo. Norman has a much better chance for birdie, to get within three and keep faint hopes alive. But he fails to hit his ten-foot left-to-right curler. He\u2019s come up short so many times today, though this fiasco can\u2019t solely be blamed on his timidity with the flat stick. Just about every aspect of his game has crumbled to dust today. It\u2019s been a comprehensive, all-encompassing, widescreen, stereophonic, surround-sound, hi-def-and-Dolby debacle. -11: Faldo (17) -7: Norman (17) Up ahead, the penultimate match comes up 18. Waldorf can\u2019t get up and down from the front to save his par, but the 33-year-old from LA signs for a level-par 72, and at -4 will safely top his previous best showings in a major, ties for ninth place at the 1992 PGA and the 1994 US Open. Mickelson meanwhile guides in a slick downhill 20-footer to save his par. A preposterous way to finish, really, given the manner in which he yipped tiddlers at 8, 11 and 12, then three-putted 14. It\u2019s a 72 for Lefty as well, and he finishes the week at -6. Another year, perhaps. He\u2019s certainly got the sort of game - the talent, the showmanship - that suits this place. But then we\u2019ve been saying this about Greg Norman since he finished fourth on debut in 1981, and look where we are right now. -11: Faldo (16) -7: Norman (16) -6: Mickelson (F) -5: Nobilo (F) -4: Hoch (F), Waldorf (F) Faldo very nearly knocks his 40-footer, with huge right-to-left break, into the cup. That would have added insult to injury. But a par is more than fine. Norman simply has to make this bogey putt. But it\u2019s an awful misread, sent way too far to the right, the ball never breaking back and stopping three feet past. A double bogey met with almost total silence. A mixture of sadness, sympathy and respect. The gallery at 16 was bouncing earlier when Ray Floyd aced; now the atmosphere is positvely funereal. These are the sort of blows some people never get over. Will Redbud become Norman\u2019s Rosebud? -11: Faldo (16) -7: Norman (16) -6: Mickelson (17) A few murmurs, little more, from the gallery. They\u2019re so sad to see it end in this grisly manner. Norman drops, his ball falling like a single tear. He clips his third shot from the dropzone to 12 feet. Why couldn\u2019t he do that 60 seconds ago? As Norman hauls himself up to the green, every one of Redbud\u2019s 170 yards will feel a mile. The crowd, sensing his agony, rise as one to greet him with the warmest ovation. He\u2019s always been popular round Georgia way. He\u2019s always been popular the world over. A lot of golf fans will be feeling for him tonight. \u201cNope! It\u2019s water!\u201d Wah! Once again, just like at 12, a seer in the Augusta gallery knows exactly where Norman\u2019s ball is headed, when it\u2019s still in mid air, carrying all of the Great White Shark\u2019s hopes and dreams. Greg goes for the pin - he\u2019s got little choice, really - but sends a big pull-hook deep into the drink. That was nowhere near terra firma. Miles from the flag, the green, dry land. His head falls. Then he allows himself a little wry smile. He realises the jig is up, the horse has bolted, the dream is over. Faldo must know how close he is to a sensational victory, too, but there\u2019s no trace of joy on his face. These two may be long-standing rivals, but while Faldo will be delighted to be in the box seat, he won\u2019t be taking any pleasure from Norman\u2019s ongoing suffering. This is incredibly difficult to watch. That was miles off target. It\u2019s Faldo first up at the iconic par-three 16th. He finds the green safely enough, but that\u2019s in conservative country, in the fat of the green but plenty away from the cup. Birdie is unlikely, but with a two-shot lead he certainly wasn\u2019t going to flirt with the water, the pin tucked back-left in its traditional Sunday position. It\u2019s all down to Greg. He needs to get close here. He takes his usual sweet time, and then ... Faldo is chipping down the green, quite the task on these hysterically fast surfaces. A lovely touch to four feet secures his birdie, then Norman tidies up for his. Still a gap of two, and Norman has come back strongly and impressively since his nightmare around Amen Corner. On another day, in another universe parallel to ours, his 70-foot putt on 14 has dropped, and his eagle chip on 15 went in too. They\u2019re tied with three to play over there. Back here on Planet Earth, GA, Faldo leads by two, and poor Norman must wonder what he has to do to get his hands on a green jacket. -11: Faldo (15) -9: Norman (15) -6: Mickelson (16) -5: Nobilo (F), Waldorf (16) Greg has match-play style advantage, a little bit further from the flag, chipping first up the bank from 60 feet. For the second hole in succession, he\u2019s so close to holing out from distance, landing his wedge softly onto the green, then rolling it out gracefully, right-to-left, towards the cup. It looks like dropping, but shaves the right-hand edge and stays up. As the gallery circling the green gasp theatrically - patrons have been allowed to congregate on the fairway, with nobody left behind - Norman falls to his knees, cocks his head back with an involuntary yelp of despair, then spins around and lands on his back, holding onto his wide-brimmed hat before springing back up in disbelief. So close to an eagle that would have given Faldo some serious pause for thought! Nobilo can\u2019t make his par putt on 18, the ball sliding just to the left of the cup. A closing bogey, but that\u2019s a 69 and he\u2019s the new clubhouse leader at -5. A fine week\u2019s work for the 35-year old from Auckland, who has yet to register a victory on the PGA Tour (four in Europe, though). Faldo\u2019s going for it. He whistles a 4-iron over the water and onto the green, though it falls off the back, from where getting up and down is no certainty. Norman was a little longer from the tee, and he\u2019s hitting 6-iron. This has to get close. His shot of destiny? Well, it nearly decides this Masters, put it that way. The nerves kicking in, just as they did on 18 a decade ago, he pushes his approach to the right. The bank on the other side of the water stuns his ball. For a terrible second, it looks like it\u2019ll roll back into the drink. But it stops safe and dry. Lucky boy, Greg. It wasn\u2019t quite as heart-stoppingly dramatic as Freddie Couples on 12 four years ago, but the old ticker would have been in his mouth for a few seconds there. Hoo boy. Some friendly golf on 15, as both Faldo and Norman send their drives into the shadows down the left. Norman will be desperate for eagle. Up on 18, Nobilo doesn\u2019t try to get too clever, shortsided with the bunker in front of him. He takes the sand out of play, landing his chip onto the ridge running across the green, letting the slope bring his ball back towards the hole. He\u2019ll be left with a downhill 12-footer - think Sandy in \u201888 - for a closing round of 68 and the clubhouse lead at -6. Meanwhile as expected, there\u2019s no birdie for Phil at 16. Nobilo looks like stumbling at the last. He finds Sandy Lyle\u2019s bunker on 18, then hits a fat iron out of it. He\u2019s well short, disappointment washing all across his face. He\u2019s left with a tricky chip over the bunker guarding the front, with not a great deal of green to play with, the pin tucked behind the trap. Back on 16, Mickelson finds the front right of the green with an uncharacteristically conservative play. You\u2019d think he needs to make everything if he\u2019s to apply any significant pressure on the leading pair; unless he curls in a huge right-to-left breaker for birdie, you\u2019d imagine that\u2019s his race run. One of the putts of the week by Norman on 14! It doesn\u2019t drop, but it\u2019s the perfect speed from 70 feet, up and over the ridge running across the green. It stops a couple of inches to the right, and that\u2019s a simple tap-in for par. Sensational, because a three-putt bogey looked a very real prospect there; that\u2019s where Mickelson three-putted from a few minutes earlier. Had Norman\u2019s effort dropped for an outrageous birdie, it might have really turned the tide. It could well have rattled the usually unflappable Faldo. But it wasn\u2019t meant to be. Faldo takes two careful putts for his par, and the lead remains two. -10: Faldo (14) -8: Norman (14) Mickelson drains his eagle putt across 16! There wasn\u2019t a whole lot of movement on the putt, and he\u2019s judged the pace perfectly. Only the second eagle of the day there! Those missed tiddlers at 8, 11 and 12, plus the three-putt at the last hole, suddenly look hella costly. He\u2019d be tying Faldo right now had his flat stick been anywhere near on its best behaviour. -10: Faldo (13) -8: Norman (13) -6: Nobilo (17), Mickelson (15) Norman\u2019s second into 14 is rotten. He finds the dancefloor, but he\u2019s shoved it well right of the target and it topples down the ridge, ending a good 70 feet away. Faldo punches his up into the heart of the green. He\u2019s not close, but he\u2019s avoided Norman\u2019s fate of dribbling away down the slope and into possible three-putt territory. Meanwhile two putts for Nobilo on 17, his birdie effort shaving the right-hand side of the cup. He remains four off Faldo\u2019s lead at -6. Faldo\u2019s drive at 14 topples off the fairway on the right and towards the trees, but he catches a break and he\u2019ll have a route into the green from there. Norman slams a biggie down the left side of the fairway. He looks a little bit more relaxed now, the worst having already happened. Perhaps he\u2019ll enjoy chasing as opposed to being chased. Up on 17, Nobilo finds the green in regulation, pin high to the left, and will have a 20-foot look at birdie. And on 15, Mickelson, from prime position in the middle of the track, whips his second pin high. He\u2019ll have a look at eagle from 30 feet. There have only been two at this hole this weekend, by Jack Nicklaus yesterday, and Davis Love III today. Advertisement break. The gallery, so quiet having witnessed Norman\u2019s collapse, crackles into life as the man himself finally arrests the slide! After careful contemplation, he taps his birdie putt with great care, sending his ball gently oscillating from left to right and back again. You\u2019d swear that was dead straight if you weren\u2019t concentrating hard. Perfectly judged, and in it drops. A desperately needed birdie! Faldo follows him in to remain two ahead, but that might give Norman, the hunted turned hunter, some crucial impetus over the final stretch. God knows he needs it, because right now Faldo doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019ll be giving him anything. Meanwhile the penultimate pairing of Mickelson and Waldorf continue to do-si-do on the leader board, swapping places yet again: the former bogeys 14, three-putting from distance, the latter birdies. Masters Sunday, right here, right now! -10: Faldo (13) -8: Norman (13) -6: Nobilo (16) -5: Waldorf (14) -4: Hoch (15), Mickelson (14) -3: Pavin (F), Love III (F), Maggert (F) Faldo\u2019s long eagle putt on 13 looks like dropping for a while. But turns out it\u2019s always missing on the low side, and slips a tricky three feet past. Norman is up next, and really has to make this birdie putt if he\u2019s to stay in this. He hasn\u2019t made one since the 2nd, a lifetime ago in a different galaxy. Up on 18, Corey Pavin takes three to get down from the front of 18 and that\u2019s a decent but ultimately disappointing final round of 71. He ends the week at -3, the joint clubhouse leader alongside Davis Love III and Jeff Maggert. He looks good for his third top-ten finish in the last five visits. A top-ten finish certainly looks on the cards for Nobilo, who sends his tee shot at 16 to five feet and tidies up for birdie. A conservative punch of the air. On only his second visit here - he missed the cut on debut last year - he moves into third on his own, three off the lead, and will be ruing his failure to pick up a shot at the inviting par-five 15th. -9: Faldo (12) -7: Norman (12) -6: Nobilo (13) -5: Mickelson (13) Those two shots took the best part of seven minutes combined. All the options considered. Golf as chess. Now Norman has no option but to get close. But after his travails at 12, he isn\u2019t in the mood to flirt with Rae\u2019s Creek. From 80 yards, he takes it out of the equation by wedging well over the flag, 15 feet past, spinning it back a little to ten feet or so. He\u2019ll have a decent look at birdie ... but that\u2019s by no means a gimme. That leaves Faldo with a decision of his own. He\u2019s just off the fairway, on the first cut to the right. Does he go for the green, effectively pressing his cleats on Norman\u2019s neck? Off comes the head cover and out comes the 5-wood. He addresses the ball and ... steps back, the breeze having picked up. He addresses it again and ... steps back again! This time he\u2019s changed his mind. The gallery mutter their disapproval, but then Faldo isn\u2019t playing to, or for, them. Eventually, after a Normanesque period of reflection, he pulls out an iron. Is he going to lay up? Nope! It\u2019s a 2-iron, and one fired into the meat of the green. He\u2019ll have a look at eagle from 40 feet. Had that ball landed ten feet to the right, the camber would have taken the ball seriously close. As is, it\u2019ll do. He bounces down the fairway, full of beans. The pressure\u2019s really on Norman now. Two putts from 40 feet for Mickelson up on the green, and that\u2019s a birdie that takes him back to a share of third at -5. Waldorf can\u2019t get up and down and the resulting bogey probably puts an end to his dream; he\u2019s -4. Once they\u2019re done, the stage is set for Norman. \u201cI feel for him,\u201d says Venturi on CBS, channelling all those emotions from 40 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to bring it back.\u201d He\u2019s got a decision to make. He\u2019s 232 yards from the pin. He can make the green, but hitting fairway wood off pine straw, a dip into Rae\u2019s Creek is a fair possibility. In an ideal world he\u2019d roll the dice and try for eagle, but he can\u2019t afford any more slip ups. After a couple of minutes of thought, and a little bit of very careful gardening, removing loose needles with a tee peg, he decides to lay up. The smart play, surely. From pine straw on 13, Mickelson fires his second into the heart of the green. His partner Waldorf pulls into a bunker on the left, and he\u2019ll have a job getting close from there, the green in front of him falling away towards the creek. Back up the hole, Norman trudges up to the tee with his head hung low. Faldo has the honour, and he sends his tee shot down the right, from where he\u2019ll likely lay up. Norman has to go for it, and belts one towards the patrons in the trees on the pine straw down the right. Oh Greg. Birdie here is a must, surely. This is an unprecedented collapse. Ed Sneed gave up a five-shot 54-hole lead in 1979 - and a three-shot lead with three to play - but even then he still managed to squeak into a play-off. However, Norman\u2019s game has fallen completely to pieces, his mind like a cake left out in the rain. Oh no no. It\u2019s extremely difficult to see him getting anything out of this. It\u2019s certainly hard to see him getting back into this proactively, put it that way. He might have to hope Faldo hits a bumpy stretch of his own, though those sort of meltdowns aren\u2019t really in the five-time major winner\u2019s DNA. \u201cSix-over par today. Is it possible to come back from something as great as that?\u201d The thoughts there of Bobby Clampett on CBS. Now there\u2019s someone else who\u2019ll be able to identify with Norman\u2019s plight, having led the 1982 Open at Troon by seven strokes after six holes of the third round, only to take three shots to get out of a pot bunker at 7, going on to card final rounds of 78 and 77. He ended the week tied for tenth. Faldo takes two putts for his par. Softly, softly, catchy Sharky. It\u2019s good enough to establish a two-shot lead, because Norman, freaked out after giving his birdie putt on 11 too much, doesn\u2019t give this bogey attempt enough oomph, and it\u2019s always dying to the right. A double bogey, and the world number one has shipped five shots in the last four holes. The singular pressures of Amen Corner. The gallery, astonished beyond volume, watch as mute. They came for entertainment; they\u2019re witnessing a comprehensive, root-and-branch mental capitulation. Norman had been in the lead for 49 holes, since making birdie at 17 on Thursday. Now look! -9: Faldo (12) -7: Norman (12) -5: Waldorf (12), Nobilo (14) Norman drops 85 yards from the flag. With his head, like his ball, swimming, he does extremely well to wedge to 12 feet. If he knocks that in, and limits the damage to bogey, it could arrest his downward momentum. It\u2019s the only way he can think about this horrific situation he\u2019s in - though trying to put a positive spin on what would be a fourth consecutive bogey takes some mental gymnastics. He trudges over Hogan\u2019s Bridge without a word. The gallery has fallen extremely quiet too. An eerie pall descends on Amen Corner. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. Norman really should aim for the heart of the green. \u201cIf I was Greg, I would not take the pin on,\u201d opines Venturi, who knows a thing or two about what Norman is going through right now, having bogeyed 9, 10, 11 and 12 himself while shipping a lead on Masters Sunday in 1956. \u201cI\u2019d take it over the fat side of the bunker and put it on the green. He\u2019s not going to win it here, but he can lose it here.\u201d Greg takes the flag on. The ball begins its fateful descent over Rae\u2019s Creek. Just before it lands on the bank guarding the front of the green, one wise old Augusta punter, who clearly knows where you can and cannot take liberties, predicts in matter-of-fact style: \u201cIt\u2019s in the water.\u201d The ball slaps the face of the bank, takes one big bounce, then a couple of sweet baby ones, then topples back quietly into the drink. Oh my. Amen Corner on Sunday, huh. Norman and Faldo receive a rousing, standing ovation as they walk up to the 12th tee. On CBS, Ken Venturi deconstructs. \u201cYou know what that ovation says? It says they\u2019re tied: may the best man win!\u201d Most of the colour has drained from Norman\u2019s stunned face. As he waits for Faldo to go about his business, he gnaws on his bottom lip like a clubber who\u2019s been a bit too liberal with the old bag of speed. His heart will be racing in similar style, too. Faldo meanwhile calmly sends a 7-iron into the heart of this most testing of par threes. Can his co-leader - his co-leader! - respond? ... Norman clacks his birdie putt down the green. It flirts with the lip on the right, but it\u2019s not lacking for speed and charges on by. He\u2019s left himself a tricky three-footer coming back. Not the worst putt in the world, but given what\u2019s happened to him recently, it\u2019s not the ideal outcome either. After trying to shake the tension from his shoulders by letting his arms hang loose, he sets himself and ... shoves a meek putt to the right, the ball lipping out. As he taps in, the patrons of Augusta National swoon and chatter in disbelief. What on earth is happening here?! Norman started the day with a six-shot lead, but all of a sudden, it\u2019s all gone! Three consecutive bogeys. No wonder he\u2019s pinching the bridge of his nose as he stumbles off the green, head bowed in bewildered contemplation. -9: Norman (11), Faldo (11) -5: Nobilo (13), Waldorf (12) -4: Mickelson (12) Mickelson bumps his chip up onto the 12th green. Not quite enough juice, he\u2019s left with a four-footer for his par. And once again his flat stick lets him down. Having pushed one left on 11, he now pulls this right. A bogey, and he\u2019s left two shots out there in short order. He slips to -4. Meanwhile Faldo can\u2019t make his 25-footer for birdie at 11. No matter, another par will do. Because ... Faldo\u2019s comparative lack of distance means he\u2019s hitting first into 11. Always an advantage in match play, which, well, y\u2019know. He piles the pressure on Norman by landing his ball 20 feet from the flag. Not sure whether he went straight for the pin or was aiming for the centre of the green and pulled it a tad, but he\u2019ll not care too much about that. Norman responds well: after twitching and tweaking his set-up this way and that for 20 seconds, he eventually drops a 9-iron into the middle of the green, and will have a fairly straight look at birdie from 15 feet or so. Worth the wait. Norman takes out his frustration on his drive at 11, and batters one miles down the middle. He\u2019s a long way past Faldo, who had crashed a big enough one down there himself. Over on 12, Mickelson goes straight at the flag, but he\u2019s long, and the ball topples off the back-right of the green. He doesn\u2019t have too much green to work with there, he\u2019ll be facing a difficult chip back up. Meanwhile here\u2019s Simon McMahon: \u201cAs Seve (+11) rides off into the sunset, my sources tell me there\u2019s a promising young Spanish golfer who may be worth keeping an eye on. Won the European amateur championship aged just 15 last year, and with it entry to this year\u2019s Open. A cool customer by all accounts. Sergio Garcia. Remember the name.\u201d Yes, we\u2019ve heard rumblings that he\u2019s something special. Word is, if he hasn\u2019t landed at least three or four majors by 2010, something will have gone seriously wrong. Up on 11, Mickelson arrows an iron straight at the flag. From 140 yards, he\u2019s now no more than four feet away. That is a sensational shot, and ballsy too, the pin tucked in behind the water, with barely any room for error. A birdie would take him to within four of the lead ... but with the sun glinting off his flat stick, he dribbles a miserable putt wide left. Like Norman up on 10, he only half-committed to the stroke, and paid the price for his timidity. That\u2019s one hell of a yip. I wonder whether he was put off by a roar of disbelief elsewhere, as news of Norman\u2019s latest bogey was posted on the leader boards? And he nearly misses the two-footer he left himself, pulling it, the ball only just toppling in on the right. He remains at -5. And he\u2019s joined there by Nobilo, who finds the heart of 13 with his approach, then rolls a gentle left-to-right slider into the cup from 25 feet. -10: Norman (10) -9: Faldo (10) -5: Nobilo (13), Mickelson (11), Waldorf (11) A lovely boring two-putt par for Faldo. If he\u2019d hit the first one, uphill from 25 feet and fairly straight, it might even have dropped for birdie. But par will do. No sweat. Norman is breaking out into cobs, though. He almost quits on his par putt, and the subsequent lack of velocity means the ball\u2019s always going to turn left before reaching the cup. That\u2019s a wretched effort in the circumstances, and as he taps in disconsolately for a second bogey in a row, one patron emits a sing-song \u201cooooh my\u201d in the style of Blanche Dubois. The tone and timing of this particular song of the south strongly suggests the subtext: \u201cUh-oh, what do we have here, this dude is losing it.\u201d -10: Norman (10) -9: Faldo (10) Norman elects to chip from just off the green at 10. And it\u2019s not the best idea. He\u2019s way too aggressive, the ball landing to the left of the hole before rolling a good ten feet past. That was so clumsy. The crowd gasp in almost theatrical horror; they\u2019re witnessing the world number one clanking the ball around Augusta in the most basic fashion. He hasn\u2019t even got to Amen Corner yet. Goodness, he really needs to knock in the par putt coming back, or the wheels will be in danger of coming off completely. Back on 10, Norman tugs a dismal second to the left of the green from 200 yards. He doesn\u2019t half enjoy visiting that side of this hole; you may recall his running up a double-bogey six from down the bank there on the final day ten years ago. He\u2019s parred the hole three times this week, though he\u2019ll need to get up and down to maintain that consistency. The good news: the ball\u2019s refused to topple down the bank, clinging onto the top by its dimples. He\u2019ll probably elect to putt from there, so par isn\u2019t a pipe dream. Speaking of consistency, the iced-tea-cool Faldo swishes an effortless iron into the heart of the green. No pin chasing. Par chasing. Given the jittery way Norman has been playing today, pars all the way in may well be enough. Some smart play by Nobilo on 13. His first response to that momentum-jiggering bogey on 12 was to whistle his drive into the pine trees down the right of the dogleg par five. There\u2019s a route to the green from where he finds himself, and he considers the New York Or Bust option for quite some time. But instead he decides to lay up, bumping his ball down the left of the fairway, well short of Rae\u2019s Creek and watery disaster. And he\u2019s left with the chance to spin close and make birdie. OK, so the 1996 Masters starts now! In other words, the final group on Sunday has reached the turn. You know how it goes. In the CBS booth, last year\u2019s winner Gentle Ben promises that \u201cwe\u2019re gonna see some stuff on this back nine.\u201d And that\u2019s a cast-iron guarantee, folks! It is Masters Sunday, after all. Faldo steps up and belts a big drive down the middle of 10. Norman passes him with an alpha 3-wood. Faldo nearly drains his birdie putt from 40 feet! He dribbles it down the glassy green, the gentlest of prods. He\u2019s judged it perfectly ... almost. The right-to-left breaker looks like dropping; one dimple\u2019s width to the left, and in it would have gone. But it lips out on the right. He taps in for a par, the crowd catching their breath. What pressure that would have put on Norman! Faldo looks in the mood now. Unlike his partner, he\u2019s in control of his game, and perhaps more importantly his emotions. Norman underscores the point by missing his par putt. A very timid effort, always missing on the left from the nanosecond it left the face of his flat stick. Suddenly there\u2019s just two in it, and Norman walks off - almost in silence, the gallery can\u2019t believe what is unfolding here - with extreme concern scrawled all across his face in capital letters. He\u2019s not quite reached the thousand-yard-stare stage yet, but the eyes are beginning to transmit the first distress signals of extreme inner pain. -11: Norman (9) -9: Faldo (9) -5: Mickelson (10), Waldorf (10) -4: Nobilo (12) Greg is off the front of 9, at the bottom of the steep slope. He\u2019s not got much green to play with, as the flag is only 20 feet over the brow. He chips up bravely, sending his ball screeching to a halt eight feet past the flag. He\u2019ll have a treacherous one coming back to save his par, but that was about as close as he could get without lucking out by hitting the flagstick or bundling the ball into the hole. He landed his chip right on top of the front slope; anything less, and his ball was coming straight back again. Faldo is on the 9th in two. Again he\u2019s played the percentages, sending his second towards the back of the green. He\u2019ll be left with a tricky downhill putt, of course, but at least he took the false front out of the equation. Norman, by contrast, goes straight for the flag near the front. But his sand wedge, from 100 yards, isn\u2019t long enough. It reaches the green, but only just, and inevitably topples back off and down the fairway. Now he\u2019s left with a tricky up and down. Speaking of down: that\u2019s how his head is hanging, as he trudges up towards the scene of the crime. And the volume of the gallery is significantly lower too: they wanted some excitement, but they\u2019re beginning to wonder whether they\u2019re witnessing the start of a slow-motion collapse. He\u2019s not been on it all afternoon, but the red flags have started waving since that backward-stumbling second shot on 8. So much for Nobilo\u2019s charge. Any slim hopes he might have harboured of snatching victory - which to be fair would require an almighty blow-up by both players in the final group - have become pretty much kaput at 12. He sends a safe tee shot into the heart of the green, deciding not to toy with Rae\u2019s Creek by going for the flag. But if you take the conservative route, you\u2019d damn well make sure to get down in two putts. From 40 feet, he races his first effort 12 feet past the flag, and can\u2019t make the one coming back. He slips back to -4. Advertising break. Norman is becoming very jumpy. He spends an absolute age setting himself over his drive at 9, his usual careful style multiplied. Shades of Doug Sanders at the 1970 Open, when he presaged his infamous missed tiddler at the last, by taking 36 seconds at address over a shot at the Road Hole, glancing 16 times up the fairway before dumping his ball in the bunker. This isn\u2019t a good sign, though to be fair he crashes this drive straight down the middle. Hopefully that will settle his nerves, which at the minute are dancing, jiving and cavorting around in plain sight. A proper hootenanny of horror. Meanwhile Frank Nobilo guides a glorious, nerveless iron into 11, and rolls home his fourth consecutive birdie from a couple of feet. He\u2019s almost certainly too far back to seriously contemplate winning, but he could sell that run to either Norman or Faldo for a pretty penny. -12: Norman (8) -9: Faldo (8) -5: Nobilo (11), Mickelson (9), Waldorf (9) -3: Love III (17), Hoch (10) Norman would have felt a whole lot better had his fourth, a delicate chip from 20 yards, dropped into the hole for birdie ... which it nearly did. A lovely touch. More of that, please, Greg. Par, which to be fair he\u2019d have taken when down that leafy swale to the left. But then a huge sucker punch: Faldo takes his time over his uphill 25-footer, pauses as caddie Fanny Sunesson tells the gallery to shut the eff up, then sends a slightly bouncy left-to-right slider scampering up to the hole and in! That\u2019s a game-changer, right there! There\u2019s only three in it! A huge cheer from the gallery, who are now permitted not only to speak, but also holler and roar. They haven\u2019t come to watch a procession, and now this is a proper competition. Faldo struts off with a look of steely determination on his boat, though he\u2019s clearly desperately trying not to give away his inner excitement with any sort of smile. He\u2019s cut Greg\u2019s lead in half! He knows this is on! Norman does extremely well to punch a low shot through a small window to the right of the trees. Under the branches it goes, bumping back into play, just off the front of the green. But that\u2019s just three of the first eight greens found in regulation. He\u2019s not in full control of his game right now. Faldo becomes the latest player to mishit his wedge into 8. From that perfect position, he flops weakly, his ball only just reaching the fringe at the front. He drops his head in despair, then turns his back on the scene in disgust. Meanwhile Greg is deep in the forest, down a bank covered liberally with pine needles. He\u2019ll have to manufacture something special, with the flag behind two trees, some overhanging branches getting in the road as well. Faldo decides to lay up with his second at the par-five 8th. Playing for position. He lands his ball short and right of the green, the perfect spot from which to attack the flag. Norman is going for it, though. Out comes the fairway wood, and he rocks back on his heels, a wild loss of control, as he pulls one into the trees down the left. Not such a good place to be. Meanwhile New Zealand\u2019s Frank Nobilo is launching a late charge. Quietly, away from the spotlight, he\u2019s just made three birdies in a row, 8 through 10, to rise up to fifth spot at -4. And Davis Love III, the hot tip of many a pundit at the start of the week, has followed up his eagle on 15 with birdie at 16. -12: Norman (7) -8: Faldo (7) -5: Mickelson (8), Waldorf (8) -4: Nobilo (10) -3: Love III (16), Hoch (9) Up on 18, the warmest ovation of the day so far. It\u2019s for the beloved Jack Nicklaus, the six-time winner. This is his 38th Masters; he\u2019s made the cut 34 times now. He nearly drains a monster for birdie, but it doesn\u2019t quite get there. It\u2019s not been the old boy\u2019s weekend: 76 and 78, and he ends +9, with only Seve (+11) and Alex Cejka (+14) below him. Still, not bad for a 56-year-old, and how about all those green coats, huh? Mickelson is flitting between the fantastic and the farcical right now. He\u2019s only just off the green, but opens the face of his wedge, takes a full swing, and sends his ball miles into the air, landing it gently four feet from the cup. That\u2019s delicious, and took some nerve too. The gallery break into coos of awed wonder. What touch. But then he prods at the par putt with great uncertainty, and it lips out on the right. \u201cAw come on Phil!\u201d hollers a disappointed-cum-affronted patron, the verbal equivalent of a clip round the lug. Mickelson deserves the brickbat; his last three strokes have been a preposterous nonsense, one way or the other. Meanwhile Waldorf pars, having duffed a chip into the green himself. -12: Norman (7) -8: Faldo (7) -5: Mickelson (8), Waldorf (8) What on earth is Lefty up to here?! He\u2019s chipping into the par-five 8th, looking to set himself up with a nice birdie putt. The young Californian has already established a reputation as a wizard with the wedge, but his Seve-style short game deserts him big-time here. It\u2019s an appalling chunk, squirting off almost straight left, landing apologetically into a bank and rolling back down the fairway. What was he trying to achieve? It almost looked as though he\u2019d set up to lob, but changed his mind mid-shot to bump-and-run. Oh dear. Mickelson reacts by alternating the position of his hands, first on his head, then on his hips. He can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s just done. Turn a decent birdie chance into a likely bogey, is what he\u2019s just done. Norman is attempting to become only the fifth player to win the Masters wire-to-wire. Craig Wood was the first player to lead outright in all four rounds, back in 1941. The other three: Arnold Palmer (1960), Jack Nicklaus (1972) and today\u2019s hole-in-one ace Ray Floyd (1976). Norman should end that particular 20-year wait this afternoon, though he shouldn\u2019t waste too many more chances like this if he\u2019s to make sure. He tugs his straight, very makeable putt left. That was a bit fidgety. I do hope his shoulders aren\u2019t tightening up again, like they did when the nerves suddenly ambushed him going up 18 a decade ago. He remains four ahead of Faldo, whose longer birdie effort was distinctly average, but the cushion should be bigger. -12: Norman (7) -8: Faldo (7) Straight out to the 7th, where Norman and Faldo are sending wedges into the green. Faldo is a little long; he\u2019ll have a snaking 20-footer coming back. Norman is pin high, though, maybe ten feet to the right of the flag. Up on 15, Davis Love III - last year\u2019s runner-up, a shot shy of Crenshaw - curls in a left-to-right swinger from the back edge of the green for eagle. He\u2019s on his way to another impressive finish; he\u2019s suddenly -2, catapulted into the top ten. The CBS telecast begins with some wise words from outgoing champ Ben Crenshaw, who missed the cut this week but served up some delicious Texas barbecue (brisket and ribs) at the Champions Dinner, so it\u2019s been swings and roundabouts. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be exciting,\u201d Gentle Ben promises. \u201cI think everyone went to sleep last night thinking Norman has this tournament, he\u2019s played magnificent golf all the way through. It appears that way. But we\u2019re at a different place where so many things have happened and can happen. One thing is that the wind is not blowing that much today, which is in Greg\u2019s favour. But on the other hand it gives these other people confidence, people are dangerous behind him. You see Nick Faldo doing what he\u2019s doing, Phil Mickelson is ever-dangerous. It\u2019s gonna be interesting!\u201d Sure is! So folks, get your pimento cheese and your iced tea, and settle down. This is happening! Sound on! Vision on! And we\u2019re live! Now it was Faldo\u2019s turn to bounce back immediately from bogey. He sent his tee shot at 6 over the flag, his ball dropping softly four feet from the cup. In went the putt, and the lead was once again cut to four. Mickelson and Waldorf continued to ping-pong up and down the leaderboard too, the former dropping one at 7, the latter making birdie. At this point, CBS will have been rabidly champing at the bit. -12: Norman (6) -8: Faldo (6) -6: Mickelson (7) -5: Waldorf (7) -3: Pavin (9), Huston (8), Hoch (8) -2: Calcavecchia (10), Els (9), Nobilo (8), McCarron (6) This was better from Mickelson. He arrowed his tee shot at the 6th straight at the flag. He made the eight-foot uphill putt he\u2019d left himself, to card only the third birdie of the day on this deceptively tricky par-three. Waldorf bogeyed, that eagle handed back to the field in double-quick time, any slim chance surely gone. Meanwhile behind on 5, Faldo dropped his first stroke of the afternoon, failing in his attempt to escape with a sandy par after missing an eight-footer. So once again the picture had changed, and Norman had five shots\u2019 worth of breathing space again. -12: Norman (5) -7: Mickelson (6), Faldo (5) -4: Waldorf (6) Norman and Faldo both went on to par the 3rd, Flowering Peach, but then on 4, more problems for the leader. Greg came up a club short at the long par-three, Flowering Crab Apple, and couldn\u2019t get up and down from the front. A second bogey in the first four holes, and perhaps the ship hadn\u2019t been totally steadied by that birdie at 2 after all. Suddenly the lead is only four. Incidentally, in the match ahead, both Mickelson and Waldorf had dropped a stroke at the troublesome 4th as well. This was already beginning to look like a slightly more interesting two-way tussle than anyone had expected, and CBS will have been wishing Augusta National had let them go live a good hour or so earlier. Maybe they\u2019ll relent one day. -12: Norman (4) -8: Faldo (4) -6: Mickelson (5) -5: Waldorf (5) But Norman bounced back well at the par-five 2nd. He was over the back in two, but elected to putt, up and over the fringe and down the ludicrously quick green. For a second, you wondered whether he\u2019d given it enough, and if the ball might stop the second it reached the short stuff. But it turned and continued to slowly turn, trickling down to kick-in distance. That was so exquisitely judged. You can\u2019t do that if you\u2019re riddled with nerves. One turn away from eagle. Birdie more than sufficed, though, given his uneasy start. Faldo matched him, getting up and down from a bunker for his own birdie to stay five behind. -13: Norman (2) -8: Faldo (2) -7: Mickelson (3) Norman wouldn\u2019t have been calmed by news of the group ahead. Phil Mickelson birdied 2, while his playing partner Duffy Waldorf nearly became the first man in Masters history to make double-eagle at Pink Dogwood, bumping a long iron into the front of the green, the camber gathering it around to the right, towards its traditional Sunday placement behind the bunker. The 33-year-old Californian, who won his first tour title at the Texas Open last year, and has top-ten finishes at both the US Open and PGA Championship to his name, rolled in his three-footer for eagle. And yes, yes, albatross, but when in Rome and all that. Double-eagle is the phrase in the official Masters literature, and these good folk are our hosts, so there\u2019s no excuse for bad manners. -12: Norman (1) -7: Mickelson (2), Faldo (1) -6: Waldorf (2) The opening ceremonial shot of this year\u2019s Tournament was taken by Gene Sarazen. The Squire won here in 1935 on his first visit, the double-eagle shot heard \u2018round the world, a 235-yard 4-wood at 15 that ultimately defeated Craig Wood, all that. He\u2019s now 94, but still managed to whistle his drive down the middle of Tea Olive. How Greg Norman must wish he could have done that today: his opening tee shot went straight into the trees! He did well to recover, managing to send his second into a greenside bunker, from which he splashed to eight feet. But his putt lipped out on the right, and that was an opening bogey. No way to calm nerves that will surely be jangling. Faldo parred, and the lead was immediately down to just the five strokes. Just the five! -12: Norman (1) -7: Faldo (1) Has there been any early action of note, ahead of CBS\u2019s upcoming live telecast? Oh yes, plenty of it and more. Let\u2019s start with the 1976 champ Ray Floyd, who mined all those years of experience to land his 5-iron at the par-three 16th in the perfect spot, back right of the green, allowing the natural slope to gather his ball down towards the traditional Sunday pin, by the pond, back left. In it serenely dropped, and that\u2019s the first hole-in-one at Augusta since 1992, and only the seventh of all time at the 16th. Greg Norman took a little while to get going this week. He started out on Thursday with six pars in a row, an unremarkable beginning to his latest bid for that elusive green jacket. Having missed the cut in his last two Tour events, was this shaping up to be another forgettable week for the Great White Shark? Nope! No! No sir! See, when Greg finally gets going, he really gets going. You know how he rolls. Those six consecutive garden-variety pars were quickly followed by a three-birdie blitz, and suddenly he was hitting the turn in 33. Then he really started motoring, tearing up the back nine. Six more birdies on his way home, the last courtesy of a spike mark on 18 that deflected a wayward putt into the hole. Hey, when it\u2019s your day, it\u2019s your day, and you\u2019ve got to take your luck while the going\u2019s good. Back in blistering style, 30 strokes, for a course-record-equalling first round of 63. Nick Price set that particular mark ten years ago. Ah, 1986, the year Norman got tight coming up the last, converting prime real estate in the centre of the fairway into an eminently avoidable bogey that cost him the chance of a play-off with Jack Nicklaus. He\u2019s come even closer since, denied a year later by Larry Mize\u2019s outrageous chip-in, then missing a 12-footer on 18 in 1989 for a play-off berth alongside unfortunate rhymer Scott Hoch and eventual winner Nick Faldo. But this year\u2019s opening-day 63 suggests that finally, this could be Greg\u2019s time. Norman followed his scintillating 63 with a swell 69 and a solid 71, and goes into the final day with an almost insurmountable six-shot lead. Surely this is his day of destiny?! No player has ever shipped as big a 54-hole lead at any major, never mind here at Augusta National. In fact, it\u2019s only happened three times on Tour (Bobby Cruickshank in 1928, Gay Brewer in 1969 and Hal Sutton in 1983). It\u2019d take a meltdown of epic proportions for Norman to be denied this time. And even then, it\u2019d probably require something special from one of the chasing pack, too. The only problem with that: Nick Faldo and Phil Mickelson are currently in second and third positions. The 25-year-old Mickelson hits it long and is fearless around the greens, with a riverboat approach to golf that Norman, pin-seeker to the marrow, will surely admire. Augusta will be Lefty\u2019s playground, maybe today, certainly sometime soon, it just has to be. Meanwhile the altogether more steady and sedate Faldo - twice a winner here already, in 1989 and 1990 - is probably the last player Norman would choose to go round with him in the final group this afternoon. Norman may have snatched the 1993 Open from under Faldo\u2019s nose with a final-day 64 at Sandwich, but when the two met in the last group on Open Saturday three years earlier at St Andrews, Faldo shot a sparkling 67 while Norman slumped to a three-putt-strewn 76, overheating under the intense spotlight of the high-profile head-to-head. He\u2019d do well to park that memory for the next few hours. But look, a six-shot lead is a six-shot lead is a six-shot lead, and by rights this should be a procession. CBS will be going live soon. It\u2019s on! Before that, though, let\u2019s remind ourselves of the state of play after 54 holes... -13: Greg Norman -7: Nick Faldo -6: Phil Mickelson -4: David Frost, Scott McCarron, Duffy Waldorf -3: Scott Hoch, John Huston -2: David Duval, Ernie Els, Lee Janzen, Frank Nobilo, Corey Pavin, Vijay Singh, Ian Woosnam"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
