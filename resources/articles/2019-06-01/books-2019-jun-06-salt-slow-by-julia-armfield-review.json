No one sleeps all that well in Salt Slow, her debut collection, either. They all have too much energy. In \u201cThe Collectables\u201d, a group of friends are burning Jenny\u2019s last boyfriend in a pit at the end of the garden. Not the boy himself, of course, only the objects that represent him. Photographs. A note he wrote on a napkin. A \u201cgrisly confetti\u201d of toenail clippings carefully collected from the bin. The fire leaves an awful smell, to explain which Jenny, Miriam and the narrator tell the neighbours they have been purging themselves of evil spirits. By then, Simon the boyfriend is off in St Austell with another girl, and they post him the ashes in a shoebox. Later, they discuss how much more convenient it would be if you could assemble a man from parts of other men. \u201cFormerly Feral\u201d opens with a woman adopting a wolf cub. Later, she marries the central character\u2019s father, and brings the cub with her, clad in \u201ca blue pinafore dress she described as its special occasions outfit\u201d. Inside a few pages, the narrator, destabilised by the marriage \u2013 not to say the lupine stepsister, who is known as Helen \u2013 has begun to let herself go; or, strictly, go wild. Will there be an exchange of personalities? An empathic humanising of the one to parallel the beasting of the other? Or is some creepier, less sentimental Ovidian process under way? A town, the narrator\u2019s father advises her, is \u201conly as interesting as its bad apples and only as safe as its lunatics\u201d, a contorted judgment that perhaps tells us more about Armfield\u2019s preferences than about the events she is preparing to unfold. The first question you ask of all these stories is, what\u2019s happening here? The answer is a kind of tender cruelty, and often a transformation, hardly noticeable to begin with, then helter-skelter. Clues are subtly underplayed, hidden off-topic, allowed to accumulate; by the time they seem less throwaway it\u2019s too late to ignore them. The apotheosis of this principle, perhaps, is \u201cStop your women\u2019s ears with wax\u201d, which follows a popular all-girl band on tour. Against their energy and impatience, everything seems clogged and slowed-down, often by a man, with the refrain: \u201cNothing I can do, sweetheart \u2026 \u201d Then the manager of a previous venue is discovered locked in his own office with a merchandise T-shirt stuffed down his throat. Gig by gig the band elicits a growing wail of frustration and fury from its all-female following, who leave behind a lengthening trail of similar accidents to men. Men aren\u2019t always a blockage, Armfield\u2019s characters will concede, but they are often as you see them in family snaps: \u201cNothing obviously wrong with any of them; they all wear logo T-shirts, like to pose next to barbecues, all seem partially blinded by the sun.\u201d And, whether solid, dependable gardeners or adolescent boys serving in chip shops, they come to grief at the hands of women who are busy making friends with the voodoo in their genes. The narrator of \u201cMantis\u201d prefers to read \u201cGreek myths and ghost stories, tales that come in under fourteen pages and culminate in violent lessons ... stories of swans and spiders, bay trees, narcissi, girls transformed into monsters by rivals playing dirty\u201d. You feel that even if she isn\u2019t speaking directly on behalf of the author, they would have plenty to agree on if they met at a book signing. But if one of the delights of Armfield\u2019s method is the richness of her allusions, her gleeful repurposing of myth and folktale, another is the liveliness of the symbols themselves, which are always evolving with the narrative: they reverse, combine, dance about in the corner of the eye. Is \u201cHelen\u201d really a wolf, or does wolfness only represent the girl? Violence teases you from under the skin, then pours out into the story. Nothing remains as you first thought, and you\u2019re never quite sure of your ground. Armfield, meanwhile, enjoys herself as the sly oracle, pretending to hide your fortune in a riddle but really telling it simply and outright. You\u2019re nodding your head in agreement and not getting the joke. What makes this collection so exciting? It\u2019s the way the salty, unsentimental underpinning of mythology combines itself with clinical contemporary observation: \u201cSomeone had once told Miriam she looked like Princess Anne and this throwaway comment had come, over time, to form the basis of her whole personality.\u201d It\u2019s the way that although Armfield is full of tenderness for her characters, she never apologises on their behalf; she\u2019s fantastical, but never less than realistic. It\u2019s the satisfying lean towards the macabre and the metamorphic, balanced by wickedly clever prose and a sense of humour that seems to loom up like a character in itself, having been lying in wait in a corner all along. It\u2019s the way that every paragraph balances itself perfectly between the visceral and the cool. \u2022 M John Harrison\u2019s You Should Come With Me Now is published by Comma.
