It is a fitting reward for the 24-year-old who has dedicated three years of his career to an often frustrating attempt to dominate the championship. It is also the first time in 20 years that a Honda rider has captured the title. \"Michelin gave us new tyres and the mechanics did a good job,\" said Kiyonari. \"They made it possible for me to win many races.\" But his chief mechanic, Adrian Gorst, put his rider's modesty in context. \"In the end you have to have the rider and Kiyo is the man,\" he said. \"He's ridden brilliantly all year.\" Britain's Leon Haslam won the 24th and final race of the series on his Airwaves Ducati and claimed runner-up position in the points table. This was his 20th podium finish of the season but in the end his fewer victories - three to Kiyonari's 11 - cost him the title. The reigning champion, Gregorio Lavilla, started the day as one of the trio in contention for the championship but the Spaniard had a torrid time. In the first race the front brake lever was knocked off his handlebar by another rider and he crashed after rushing into the subsequent corner without brakes. In the second outing his bike stopped on the first lap with gearbox problems, but his 18 podium finishes over the season helped Ducati to clinch the manufacturers' title. Haslam won a \u00a350,000 Audi car on Saturday when he took pole position and claimed the award for the best qualifying performance over the season. And he continued in confident fashion when he overtook Rizla Suzuki's Shane Byrne to lead the first lap of the opening race. The rain fell after three laps, however, and the riders were called in and allowed to change tyres. Haslam again muscled to the front on the restart, with Kiyonari tucked in behind him. The pair traded places at the front until the Briton, on hearing an unusual noise from his machine, decided to save his effort until the closing laps to avoid stressing his engine. But the plan was wrecked when Byrne crashed and came to rest with half his body on the track and half on the grass. Officials stopped the race and, because riders had by then covered more than two-thirds of the distance, their placings at that point were taken as the result. \"I'll be really disappointed if that costs me the championship,\" Haslam said. \"I was feeling pretty confident behind Kiyonari and I was waiting for the last two laps.\" Kiyonari began the second race knowing that third place would be good enough to win the title even if Haslam won on this turbulent, rain-affected afternoon. He settled for second place behind Haslam, with the cushion of his fellow Honda riders Jonathan Rea and Karl Harris riding shotgun behind him; they were never going to challenge Kiyonari unless they wanted to sever relationships with the world's largest motorcycle manufacturer. The race was eventually red-flagged when Yamaha's Tommy Hill crashed; neither he nor Byrne suffered serious injuries. Australia's Troy Bayliss won the World Superbike Championship for Xerox Ducati when he finished fifth in the first of two races at Imola in Italy. Alex Barros won his first World Superbike race in the first leg and Bayliss took the second. Britain's James Toseland climbed to second place in the championship, with one round remaining, by finishing second and fifth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
