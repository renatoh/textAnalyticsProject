Grimble by Clement Freud. I read it when I was about eight. It was the first book that made me laugh out loud, a lot. For some strange reason it is now out of print - I think it's a sin that it's not readily available. When you were growing up did you have books in your home? It wasn't a particularly bookish household but we were encouraged to read by our parents. The thing I remember is my sister and I trying to get hold of books like A Clockwork Orange that we were told to leave well alone. Was there someone who got you interested in writing? My favourite class at school was English Language, especially when we got to write short stories. When I was about 15 one of my teachers was incredibly encouraging. His name was Alan Black and I still remember his words. What made you want to write when you were starting out? I started as a scriptwriter for films. I had a number of ideas and stories in my head that I had to get out; if only so they would leave me alone. And I think the need for that purging process still exists. Do you find writing easy? No I don't. There are times when it is a real struggle but I don't think those black moments ever dent my enthusiasm. I think writing it is a craft that you get better at with practice. What makes you write now? It's because I knew very early on that I wouldn't be able to work in an office. I remember my mother saying I would grow out of that idea but I haven't. And I still get a buzz when I turn on the computer at the beginning of the day. How do you write (do you have a daily routine?) I kick off as soon as the kids leave for school. I wander out into my little stone hut in the garden and put in a pretty productive morning. I start flagging early afternoon and I pick the kids up from school. Often, I write again late at night. How do you survive being alone in your work so much of the time? It is hard. You spend so much of your life in this parallel universe that you have created. But I play football a couple of times a week and I think team sport is a healthy antidote to being a reclusive and sitting on your own all day. What good advice was given to you when you were starting out? There is an old adage in scriptwriting circles which goes \"character is action\". The plot can only do a certain amount. If the characters don't hold the attention of the reader then you are fighting an uphill battle. What advice would you give to new writers? Don't launch into your story until you are ready to; have a clear idea of the world you intend to create and of the characters who you intend to populate it with. Do the groundwork first and only start writing when you are ready to. Is there a secret to writing? Only that you should write the sort of story you would like to read, and hope there are enough people out there who agree with you. What are you working on at the moment? A murder mystery set on the island of Malta during the second world war. \u00b7 Mark Mills's The Savage Garden was selected for the Richard and Judy Reading Club's Summer Read 2007.
