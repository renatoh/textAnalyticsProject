And she was like fine but we should think ourselves lucky tbh, given no one had spotted the Phil Green internship which was a bargain actually, six months as a non-dom would be a brilliant gap year, and the most expensive one, which was shadowing Tommy Strathclyde and came with an actual peerage and everything you could eat and drink and shag for a month. And Rebekah is right because when you think about the champagne waterfall and all those Neets fired out of cannons, even Bob Diamond was impressed, it could have been much worse, and no one has a clue that we raffled the Forest of Dean, the Candy brothers are thrilled. So the big news was Dave's speech, which was so passionate and he was in his shirt and Tamara was going grrrrr, and even Anya who is quite cold went I'll have what he's having and now literally no one can talk about anything else, which is lovely but also quite worrying. Because although I love the big society probably more than anyone else except Dave obvs, and the Hiltonator, plus I have done woodwork for it with some actual very sad teenagers so nobody can say it is just an act, it is so hard to explain, like trying to tell people why they need a crested pigskin passport cover, they just have to take it on trust. Even Mummy who is brilliantly clever says she has no idea what it means but if volunteers are going to save the libraries she will have a major problem because she has already put out feelers for the one in Headington, total Oka territory, plus they could keep a few books for atmosphere. So it is such bliss to be in fashion week because everyone is so uber-positive and nice, even about chinstraps, and that is what the big society is all about, I think.
