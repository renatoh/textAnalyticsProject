Five years later comes a follow-up that adds live electronics, and three interpretations of pieces by late bebop-piano pioneer Bud Powell. Lehman's octet (again including such virtuosi as trumpeter Jonathan Finlayson, bassist Drew Gress and drummer Tyshawn Sorey) sounds both mathematically measured and as raucous as a New York street on Segregated and Sequential, both adrift and anchored on the spooky 13 Colors, and stately and tail-chasingly animated on Powell's Glass Enclosure. It's lost in space on Parisian Thoroughfare, jazzily horn-hooting on Codes: Brice Wassy, and shiveringly sepulchral and then brightly swinging over Gress's muscular bass on Autumn Interlude. \"A blast of urban futurism\" was how the New York Times described Lehman's earlier work, adding that it was \"hypnotic, kinetic and kaleidoscopic \u2013 and funky\". Remarkably, Mise en Ab\u00eeme raises the bar on all that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
