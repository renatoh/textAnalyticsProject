Don't worry, says Lloyds TSB, just default on your repayments", "bodyText": "When David Counsell was told to default on loan payments to Lloyds TSB by one of the bank's own debt advisers he thought the world had turned upside-down, writes Phillip Inman . Mr Counsell, 31, owed \u00a36,400. He wanted to repay it but his salary as night manager of a Preston hotel failed to cover his rent and travel costs as well as repayments. If he could reduce the payments and stretch his loan over a longer period, he would get himself straight, he told the bank. An adviser told him the branch could not change the terms of his loan. Only the centralised customer credit department could renegotiate with a customer. Before it could negotiate, Mr Counsell would need to be in default. He was told defaulting would appear on his credit records and might harm his chances of getting further credit, though the branch could offer him an overdraft facility to bridge short-term difficulties. Two months ago he stopped making loan payments and this week intends to approach Lloyds TSB with the support of his local citizen's advice bureau. \"The bank just says 'have another overdraft' ... I don't want to do that any more,\" he said. A spokeswoman said it was not bank policy to recommend that customers default on loans. She said the credit department tried to get in touch with Mr Counsell, without success."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
