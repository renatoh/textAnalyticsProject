First, Utah liquor laws can be peculiar. At some places, you must have food in front of you while drinking. At others you don't. Be flexible and you'll be pleased by the great beverage scene here. Bar X Bar X opened its doors in 1933, but its current version put air in the lungs of the downtown scene. Nowadays, the menu is somewhat normal for those who know the prohibition-style cocktails \u2013 Sidecar, French 75, Old-fashioned. But when it opened, the ultra-cool, refreshingly complex style hadn't made it from the coasts to Utah. Modern Family's Ty Burrell, his brother and a few others revived Bar X from its slumber a few years ago. Bar X is well known in the city as the place to get the most masterfully mixed cocktails transcending the prohibition era. \u2022 155 East 200 South, +1 801 355 2287, barxsaltlake.com. Open Mon-Fri 4pm-2am, Sat-Sun 6pm-2am Finca Finca, a spanish tapas bar in Sugar House, lays claim to Scott Gardner, the best mixologist in Salt Lake City according to the local authority, Salt Lake Magazine. Known for his connection with cocktails from a bygone era, Scott serves up a few complex pre-prohibition-era classics like the Clover Club (gin, lemon juice, house grenadine and an egg white) or a simple shot of a Van Winkle 12-year. But don't limit him to what's on the menu. Belly up to his bar on a slow night in Sugar House and ask for Scott's latest creation. \u2022 1291 South 1100 East, +1 801 487 0699, fincaslc.com. Open Mon-Thurs 11am-10pm, Fri-Sat 11am-11pm, Sun 10am-9pm Twilite Lounge Twilite Lounge is a Salt Lake City staple serving the area since 1947. Serving local favourite Uinta Brewing alongside a few others, this dive-bar somehow attracts the well-dressed post-work crowd, hipsters, moms, dads and bikers fully warranting City Weekly's award of \"Best Assorted Clientele\" in 2009. Though it is a dive-bar by category, it's actually quite clean and approachable. Come thirsty but don't bring a credit card. In true shady, dive-bar fashion, Twilite Lounge is cash only. But don't worry, there's an ATM in the back. \u2022 247 East 200 South, +1 801 532 9400, twilitelounge.com. Open Mon-Sat 1pm-1am, Sun 11am-midnight Pallet When the environment matters as much as the beverage, choose Pallet. Drink-master Matt Pfohl curates a beverage list sure to satisfy the most serious cocktail palate in a restaurant with design focused on every square inch. But don't let that intimidate you. At Pallet you'll find the classics like a Negroni, Sidecar, Vieux Carre, as well as Matt's creations \u2013 Phil Collins (Rye Silver whiskey, cynar, rose-cherry) and Jailbait (genever gin, mescal, punt e mes, chartreuse, maraschino, bitters). \u2022 237 South 400 West, +1 801 935 4431, eatpallet.com. Open Tues-Fri 11.30am-3pm (lunch), Tues-Sat 5pm-to close (dinner) Beerhive Before Beerhive opened its doors, the beer-seeker had few options for a bar with a good, exhaustive beer list. Most of the choices were seedy and built in the days before windows were allowed in bars in Salt Lake City. Beerhive brought a classiness to the Salt Lake beer drinker allowing him or her to enjoy a tasty high-point in a classy, wood-toned bar setting where vibe and beverage work together to bring a warm, inviting feel. Sit behind the bar on the sidewalk patio and sift through the menu of hundreds of bottled beers from around the world. \u2022 128 South Main Street, +1 801 364 4268, no website. Open daily midnight-2am Desert Edge Located in the old trolley car hub of Trolley Square, Desert Edge has been serving homemade, hand-crafted brews since 1972. On an average night, you can find businessmen and college students watching a game, drinking a pitcher of whatever the brewmaster Chris Haas has on tap. A few beers stay on the menu year-round, like the Utah Pale Ale or the Latter Day Stout, but he reserves a few for seasonal enjoyment, like the Summertime Kristalweizen. \u2022 273 Trolley Square, +1 801 521 8917, desertedgebrewery.com. Open Mon-Wed 11am-midnight, Thurs-Fri 11am-1am, Sat 11.30am-1am, Sun midday-10pm The Red Door The Red Door has been serving speciality cocktails in Salt Lake City for little more than a decade, but it already feels like a staple. Situated across from the Capitol Theater (home of Ballet West, the longest running ballet company in the United States) and next door to Hotel Monaco, this cocktail spot serves an exhaustive list of martinis from traditional Manhattans to Dirty Girl Scouts (vodka, Irish cream, coffee liqueur and creme de menthe). If you're looking for good vibe, a nice patio and lots of martini options, search for the Red Door in downtown Salt Lake City. \u2022 57 West 200 South, +1 801 363 6030, behindthereddoor.com. Open Mon, Tues, Sat 6pm-to close, Wed, Thurs, Fri 5pm-to close Avenues Proper Avenues Proper is a humble brewing operation with a great pedigree that opened in May in the historic Avenues neighbourhood of downtown Salt Lake City. Brewmaster Rio Connelly always has four house brews on tap, including local favourite Epic Brewing, alongside several others (Uinta Brewing, Squatters, Wasatch). Step in the front door and immediately see the large fermentation vessels and aging tanks. Go to the Avenues Proper for a Real Salt Lake match, the local soccer club, while enjoying carefully crafted beer. \u2022 376 8th Avenue, +1 385 227 8628, avenuesproper.com. Open Tues-Sat 11.30am-3pm (lunch), Tues-Sun 5pm-10pm (dinner), late nights Thurs-Sat till 1am The Garage Venture north of town to the underbelly of Salt Lake City, and you'll find the Garage where you can catch a show and cheap beer. Literally a garage in the 1940s, the current iteration of this place is by far the best attracting locals out of the emerging downtown scene into the shadows of an oil refinery. The Garage's huge patio is packed on summer nights with great local acts such as the Utah County Swillers or Jay Henderson. \u2022 1199 Beck Street, +1 801 521 3904, garageonbeck.com. Open daily 11am-1am The Bayou In the heart of downtown, a Utah favourite plays host to large beer-drinking crowds and jazz enthusiasts. The Bayou has offered a large, diverse beer list since before Utah understood that was valuable. If you want to try something obscure or venture into the unknown fruit of the hops, this is the place. Settle into a booth and ask your server to surprise you with a beer rarely ordered. If you already have a favourite, chances are the Bayou will have it or something comparable from draft beers or bottles. \u2022 645 South State Street, +1 801 961 8400, utahbayou.com.
