Putting had always been a problem for the colourfully attired Faulkner. But then he discovered a putter which he claimed had been hewn from driftwood and it gave him confidence. \"I'll never miss another one of those,\" he said, holding his hands a few feet apart. His unusual putter helped him to victory at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland in 1951. He received a cheque for \u00a3300. The final two rounds of the Open were played in one day and before the last 18 holes he signed an autograph \"Max Faulkner, Open Champion, 1951\". In an era when golfers dressed drably he wore pink plus-fours, salmon socks and pink shoes. In hospital with a perforated eardrum during the war and upset by the dull clothes and army uniforms, he promised from then on he would wear the brightest colours he could find. He did not disappoint. Faulkner loved comedians and Norman Wisdom was a close friend. Max Schmeling aged 99 Germany's world heavyweight boxing champion is perhaps best remembered for suffering one of the most brutal defeats in the sport's history. His fight with America's Joe Louis, the \"Brown Bomber\", at New York's Yankee Stadium in June, 1938, was more than a mere boxing match. Schmeling, reluctantly, was being used as a propaganda tool by the Nazis. As a representative of Hitler's \"master race\" his meeting with a black American was charged. Louis launched a ferocious attack and Schmeling went down three times before the referee stopped the fight after two minutes and four seconds. Two years earlier, just before the Berlin Olympics, Schmeling had caused a sensation by knocking out Louis in a non-title bout; there were riots in Harlem. In America he was dubbed the \"Heil Hitler Hitter\". But Schmeling did not support Hitler and defied orders from the F\u00fchrer to replace Joe Jacobs, his Jewish-American trainer. Sixteen years ago it was revealed that, in 1938, he saved two young Jewish brothers from a Nazi death camp. In later life, as a wealthy businessman, he helped the impoverished Louis. Best Mate and Rooster Booster The death of Best Mate, the most popular racehorse since Desert Orchid and the greatest jumper since Red Rum, left the racing world aching with grief. Comparisons with Arkle may have been a little far-fetched. But Best Mate had equalled the Irish horse's feat, 40 years earlier, of winning three Cheltenham Gold Cups. Cottage Rake and Golden Miller are the only others to have won National Hunt's blue riband more than twice. A fourth victory was being talked about last March before a broken blood vessel finished the horse's famous association with the Cotswolds. He died on the racecourse, making a comeback in the Haldon Gold Cup at Exeter two months ago. The racing community was still recovering from the blow when it heard of the death, in similar circumstances, of Rooster Booster earlier this month. He died on the gallops, also of a suspected heart attack, while being prepared for Boxing Day's Stan James Christmas Hurdle at Sandown. The popular grey, 10 times a winner, won the 2003 Champion Hurdle. George Best aged 59 Undoubtedly the finest footballer produced by the British Isles, Best was also a useful snooker player. When, some years ago, he invited his son, Calum, to take one of his trophies he was upset the chosen item was the gaudy trophy he had won at a London snooker club. \"Everyone knew I could play football a bit,\" he moaned. \"But that was proof I could play snooker too.\" Best was more than a great footballer. He was the biggest sports star the UK has had. As someone said when he died, \"football was in black and white when he started playing but in glorious Technicolor by the time he finished, all too early\". Johnny Haynes aged 71 During a long career Haynes made 594 league appearances for Fulham, scoring 146 goals. He played 56 times for England and was renowned for his long passing. He was only 31 when England won the World Cup in 1966 and should have played a pivotal role in that tournament. But he was never quite the same player following a car accident in 1962 which left him with a badly injured knee. In one sense he was a very modern player. Haynes was the first famous beneficiary of the abolition of the maximum wage rule. His pay jumped to the previously only dreamed of \u00a3100 a week. Noel Cantwell aged 73 A double international, he represented Ireland at football and cricket. Essex offered him terms but he is remembered mainly for football. He was an outstanding full-back at West Ham and Manchester United. He was also thoughtful, humorous and eloquent. He made 121 league appearances for Manchester United and led them when they beat Leicester 3-1 in the 1963 FA Cup final. When he retired, in 1967, he became manager of Coventry City for five seasons and then of Peterborough United for a similar period. He had another managerial spell with Posh in the 1980s, opened a pub in 1991 and, to his joy and amusement, was then given a scouting job by Sven-Goran Eriksson. David Sheppard aged 75 A tall, graceful, right-hand batsman, he was a splendid cricketer. He was the first ordained minister to play Test cricket. Sheppard played 22 times for England, scoring 1,172 runs (37.80), including three centuries. His first-class average of 43.51, from 15,838 runs, revealed a player of high class. He topped the national averages in 1952, when he was still at Cambridge, before, the following year, becoming an inspirational captain of Sussex. He also led England in 1954. He was a less successful fielder and when he put down one catch off Fred Trueman, the bowler replied: \"It's a pity t'Reverend don't put his hands together more often in t'field.\" He was Bishop of Woolwich before becoming Bishop of Liverpool in 1975. Sheppard was made a life peer in 1998. Brian Luckhurst aged 66 A brave opening batsman for Kent and England, he was renowned for his concentration and for the ferocity of his square-cut. He had been a solid county pro for many years when, at 31, he was first picked for England against the Rest of the World in 1970. He scored a very impressive 113 in the second match of the series at Trent Bridge. In Australia in 1970-71 he was a solid performer in Ray Illingworth's Ashes winning team, scoring 455 runs at 56.87, with centuries in Perth and Melbourne. When he returned there four years later, to face Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, he failed. But so did everyone else. Later he became Kent's coach, then marketing manager. Charles Palmer aged 85 and Ken Suttle aged 76 Palmer became better known as an administrator than a cricketer and was president of MCC in 1978-79 and chairman of the old TCCB between 1983 and 1985. Small and bespectacled he hit the ball with improbable power. He was also a bowler of medium pace and occasional \"donkey-drops\". As Leicestershire captain at The Oval in 1955 he brought himself on to allow his main bowlers to change ends and took eight wickets for seven runs. He then peeked round the Surrey dressing room door and said: \"Sorry, gentlemen.\" He toured the West Indies in 1953-54 as player/manager of Len Hutton's side and played his solitary Test in Barbados, where he scored 22 and 0. Ken Suttle always believed he should have played in that match after he had scored 96 and 62 in the warm-up against Barbados. Between 1954 and 1969 the neat, left-handed Suttle played 423 consecutive championship games for Sussex. He was shocked when he turned up for a match in 1971 only to be told he was no longer required. He also played football on the wing for Chelsea and Brighton. Fazal Mahmood aged 78 Pakistan's greatest fast bowler before Imran Khan, Fazal took 139 wickets in 34 Test matches and five in an innings on 13 occasions. He preceded Imran in another way; women adored him for his good looks as well as his cricket heroics. He bowled at fast medium, swung the ball, had a very good leg-cutter and also a dangerous break-back. A key figure in Pakistan's famous Test win at The Oval in 1954, he had figures of 12 for 99. Richard Burns aged 34 At his memorial service earlier this month the only Englishman to win the World Rally Championship was remembered as \"the angel with X-ray eyes\". At the start of his career he had been overshadowed by the daredevil Scot Colin McRae, who also became world champion. The very English Burns was a more controlled and precise driver. He drove very fast but always, it seemed, within himself. He was narrowly beaten to the world title by his Mitsubishi team-mate Tommi Makinen in 1999 and the following year he was pipped by Marcus Gronholm. But in 2001, driving a Subaru, he took the crown before moving to Peugeot to join Gronholm. In 2003 he was diagnosed with a brain tumour and did not compete again as he fought the illness. Collette Besson aged 59 Besson, who died of cancer, was the heroine of France when she pipped Britain's golden girl Lillian Board to win the 400 metres in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico. Few had expected her to get through the heats. Board also died of cancer, in 1970. Trevor Foster aged 90 A rugby league hero of his time, he was a back-row forward of courage, speed and flair. He represented Wales and Great Britain but is best remembered for his long association with Bradford. He turned professional for \u00a3400 when he switched from playing rugby union with Newport in 1938. He made 432 appearances for Bradford Northern and scored 130 tries. He was 40 when he played for them for the last time in 1955. Nine years later he helped re-form the club after they had gone bankrupt. Foster played for Wales 16 times, seven as captain, and died three days after the launch of his autobiography. Jean Prat aged 81 The Frenchman was one of rugby union's greats, a back-row forward with all-round gifts. He scored 139 points from 51 internationals in a low-scoring era and his nine tries and five drop-goals were considered remarkable for a forward. He was an essential presence when France won in Wales for the first time, in Swansea in 1948, and scored the only try in his country's first win over the All Blacks in 1954. Al Hayes 76 Lord Alfred Hayes, or \"Judo\" Al Hayes, was one of Britain's best known wrestlers and enjoyed a 40-year career in the sport. He made his name on the American circuit after moving across the Atlantic in 1972 before becom- ing a manager and a popular announcer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
