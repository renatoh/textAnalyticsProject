She trained when she became underwear editor of Vogue at the age of 20. \"I took the job very seriously,\" she recalls. \"I could bore for Britain about dual buttock control.\" She was, one might say, starting at the bottom. This week Boler retires after 19 years as editor of Brides magazine, a role in which she's had the extraordinary experience of seeing her potential core readership slump by 50% - there are now only half the number of first-time brides that there were in 1982 - but her circulation rise. In 1982 the magazine sold 58,412, today it sells 65,450. Whatever the underlying social trends, there are still, it seems, countless women for whom the wedding day is a pivotal moment in their lives. And Boler is their staunchest champion. \"Every girl who gets married has a secret image of herself, of how she wants to look on that day. And I believe in her right to look beautiful, if only for once in her life, and for everyone to be on her side for that moment. And it is true that brides are radiant; even the plainest, plumpest girl is transformed. I get very angry if I ever hear anyone say anything against a bride. They really get a tongue lashing.\" On that basis, the magazine's essential task is to create that inspirational image: each issue usually features five different looks as well as practical advice and guidance on every aspect of the big day. The hard part, she says, is to appeal both to the reader who buys a single copy and the one who buys steadily for a year. \"So every issue has in some senses to be all things to all women, but at the same time it's got to be different. But I can honestly say that although you're always dealing with the same subject, there's never ever been a day when I've woken up and thought there's nothing more I can say. There are as many images and ideas as there are brides.\" Enthusiastic as Boler has remained about her job - and she can't think of any contemporary with a similar length of tenure - it was certainly never one she sought. She first came to Cond\u00e9 Nast in 1962, having \"skipped\" into Vogue House on impulse while crossing Hanover Square and asked for a job. By a curious coincidence, the post of junior fashion editor in charge of underwear had just become vacant, its occupant having moved to become editor of Brides. \"She was thereafter only spoken of in hushed tones, if at all. It wasn't exactly an infra dig job but it certainly wasn't cool.\" In those days the staff at Vogue still dressed like mannequins - \"they wore gloves to work\" - and Boler was almost the only employee without private means - \"my secretary had a Lamborghini, but then her grandfather was the founder of Shell\". She often lived off peanut butter sandwiches and once pawned a mink jacket. It was not long, though, before the revolution of the 60s blew in, giving Boler the role of the woman who probably introduced tights to Britain. \"I'd got some from America and I went around telling everyone about them. It was like that sketch whereWalter Raleigh's trying to explain tobacco. About the only two who listened were Mary Quant and John Sainsbury. He stocked them in his shops and they sold out within the hour.\" At Vogue she fell in love with Adrian Hamilton, then the magazine's features editor, now the Independent's leader page and comment editor. Their wedding at St Bride's in Fleet Street was, she says, wonderful. \"I was married on the same day as Cilla Black and we both wore John Bates dresses. Hers was a purple pelmet, mine was in white jersey with a long train, a high neck and gauntlet cuffs. It was seriously trendy. We both had our pictures in the papers. I probably got in because Monty was among the guests.\" It was Field Marshal Lord Montgomery, a friend of her father-in-law Dennis Hamilton, editor of the Sunday Times, who gave them their oddest wedding present: a red flannel shirt belonging to Garibaldi, which he had been given by the Italian government at the end of the war. A spell in fashion at the Sunday Times was followed by a return to Vogue to launch their More Dash Than Cash section. Boler then took almost a decade off work to have two sons and a daughter. She nearly died having Laura when she suffered a massive haemorrhage during a dinner party. \"The surgeon came to see me before he scrubbed up and I remember thinking, 'What I say now may well be my last words', but all I could think of was, 'That's a brilliant jacket, is it by Kaffe Fassett?' Once a fashion editor always a fashion editor.\" With her children at school she returned to Cond\u00e9 Nast as a reluctant features editor on Brides. \"I just couldn't imagine myself with all that white tulle stuff but I became absolutely hooked.\" Within two years she was editor. In those days, half the content was to do with setting up home, but that has been scaled down over the years, partly because of the growth of home interest magazines and partly because of a rise in the average age of brides: when women marry later they often have a home already. Other changes have included the expansion of gift lists and the growth of the themed reception: the magazine's most successful coverline is always something on the lines of \"How To Make Your Reception Different\". \"It's partly the cult of personality and self expression, of the 'me generation' perhaps,\" says Boler. \"But it's also about freedom. And couples now want to celebrate with their friends, they're doing it for their peers these days, which I think is a good thing. You need to make those promises in front of your own generation because they're the ones whose support you'll need if you run into trouble.\" She believes celebration is as much about style as money. \"One of the best [weddings] I went to was held in a field. The guests sat on bales of hay covered with red and white gingham and ate fish and chips and drank champagne. It's really not my business if someone wants to spend \u00a3100,000 on a wedding, but personally, I'm uneasy with real excess. The only times I really felt bad about an issue was when all the dresses were too expensive.\" Although a Catholic since converting in her 30s, Boler is not against register offices - \"I've witnessed as much love and sincerity there as in any church\" - or other appropriate venues. She does, however, deplore the trend to marry in completely outlandish places. \"It's done for a lark which is a really bad idea. I want to say to them 'Look, these are your lives you're joining together. Why are you doing something as laddish as getting married on a roller coaster?'\" Her last issue will be the March/April edition, featuring work by her favourite photographers and her choice of some of the best images over the years. After that she will be retained as a consulting editor to her successor, Liz Savage, but has vowed to stay out of the office. At 60, and with circulation at its best for a decade, Boler's retirement was a decision rather than an obligation, but there's a lot she wants to do - \"travel, learn mah jong, go to the cinema in the middle of the day, put together a couple of books perhaps\". None of her children is yet married but she remains optimistic there will be a family wedding to help with one day. For despite the divorce statistics and the fact that in recent years Brides readers wanted fewer and fewer serious articles on subjects such as actually making marriage work, Boler remains sanguine about the institution itself and about the wedding as its launch pad. \"I believe in the hope of happiness and in commitment. Every couple will have unhappy times but I believe you can hang on in better if you have that framework. Perhaps I'm yesterday's woman with anachronistic views but I still give the thumbs-up sign to every wedding car I see.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
