It was well edited.\u201d Would he consider commissioning something similar? \u201cNot a chance.\u201d Southgate\u2019s laughter fills a room dominated by a photograph of his late predecessor. An Impossible Job II remains on hold. Southgate, who turns 48 on Monday, watched all eight episodes of All or Nothing but it is a series set in Russia this summer that has dominated his TV viewing since the World Cup. England\u2019s semi-final defeat by Croatia in particular has been subject to forensic analysis by the manager who, at a safe seven-week distance from the euphoria that accompanied the country\u2019s best run since 1990, concedes there was plenty of scope for improvement. \u201cOur biggest issue was not keeping the ball,\u201d the England manager says. \u201cYou can talk about changing the system slightly to plug the gaps without the ball but fundamentally we have to keep the ball better under pressure. And we stopped doing that. It seemed like it was second half but actually there were moments in the first half where we were the same. It was almost as if, because we were ahead, we went a bit safer. \u201cI understand the discussion around substitutions but very often that is the benefit of hindsight. We make changes against Colombia to try to do what we supposedly should have done against Croatia. We let an equaliser in against Colombia so that\u2019s the wrong thing to do but then it\u2019s the right thing to do against Croatia. Our wing-backs stopped getting out quickly enough so we ended up with a back five rather than a three.\u201d In keeping with the squad selected for next Saturday\u2019s Uefa Nations League game against Spain, and the friendly with Switzerland the following Tuesday, there will be no major tactical upheaval from Southgate this week. The three-man central defence is to be honed, not abandoned. \u201cWe are looking at how we can be better in terms of options in buildup, getting more men in the box and more penetration from the wing-backs in particular,\u201d the manager says. \u201cI think it\u2019s the right thing to start with the system we finished with because we can still get better with that and it definitely allowed us better options in first- and second-phase buildup. But over a period of time we have always got to look at that because maybe some of the players who come through might suit a better system.\u201d The England manager has used his first press conference since the World Cup, and his position of strength, to call repeatedly for Premier League clubs to start more homegrown talent or risk losing them to the game. Only 30% of players who have started Premier League matches this season are English and the decline, from 33% last year, partly explains the approach to Declan Rice. The West Ham defender has three senior caps for the Republic of Ireland but can switch allegiance to England as all three were friendly fixtures. Southgate confirms he has spoken to Rice about his international future. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say I have spoken with him but I have not promised anything because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. I think that would be unethical. It\u2019s a very difficult situation and I can understand the debate on all sides. The landscape is very complicated. The way the world is now, families are quite transient and nearly every player in our under-15s and 16s are dual nationality. \u201cThis is something all countries are aware of. All I would say for Declan is I think the boy is in a really difficult position now and I\u2019m extremely conscious of that. He has to make a decision and it\u2019s important that he is allowed that opportunity.\u201d Southgate wants improvement within his existing core of young talent at Wembley and the King Power Stadium, the latter of which will host the Switzerland fixture. He applies the same demand to himself and the England coaching team. \u201cI am confident we can improve because I have managed only 200 games,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery game you manage and every training session you take and every interaction you have you should learn and improve from. In terms of numbers of matches I am still relatively inexperienced. That said, I know I have lived through as high a pressure environment as you are going to face and come through with the team with as good a performance as we have had in 50 years. Of course you gain confidence going through that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
