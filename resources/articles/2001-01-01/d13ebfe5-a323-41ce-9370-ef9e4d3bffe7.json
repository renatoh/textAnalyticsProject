'Dad,' revealed our 11-year-old brother Theo, 'went paragliding.' We tried to imagine it, and were impressed with the results. There is something about being on holiday that leads people to try out activities that would otherwise fill them with horror. When I was in New Zealand, I blithely agreed to part with a significant sum of money to do a tandem skydive. In no time at all, I was being fitted with an unflattering, brightly coloured jumpsuit. Half an hour later, I was was strapped to a burly young man and allocated a place on the small plane. I knew I was only going to leave it by jumping out at 12,000 feet. I sat on the edge of the doorway, with my feet dangling out. All my instincts were screaming at me not to jump, yet I did it. As we headed towards earth, freefalling for 45 seconds and then floating under the parachute, I was exhilarated. I couldn't stop laughing. When we landed I wanted to go back up and do it again. Despite this, I have never repeated the experience at home. Being away from familiar situations leads us, consciously or not, to reinvent ourselves to some degree. We feel a thrill when the plane takes off, or the white cliffs of Dover recede, or the train plunges into the tunnel. Being away from the everyday routine means that, by definition, you will be doing things you would not normally be doing, whether it's reading a book all day, paragliding, or rock climbing. One hot afternoon last summer, I found myself hanging on to a centimetre-thin ledge, high up on a cliff face in the south of France. My boyfriend James is an expert climber, but it was not until we were safely away from home that I allowed him to teach me the basics. We trekked to the bottom of some cliffs near Venasque in Provence. I was fascinated by the harnesses, the belaying, the fact that James had an ability I'd never seen before, to hang upside down on the underside of a rock, holding on by the tips of his fingers and the edges of his toes. I was astonished, but Tim, who was three, was not impressed. 'O\u00f9 est ta mere?' I asked him, as his mother expertly climbed a high rocky outcrop, apparently fixed to the cliff by magic. He looked around. 'Elle est l\u00e0-bas,' he told me, pointing nonchalantly, and we went back to our game. When my turn came, I knew I was safe in a harness and that if I fell off the worst that could happen was that I would hang in the air and feel silly. I knew the struggle was largely mental. I knew people damaged their tendons by hanging on too tightly, grasping the rock with their fingernails, when all they needed to do was to use the handholds to balance. I couldn't help myself gripping on for dear life. I struggled to the top and surveyed the Proven\u00e7al countryside. I grinned as I abseiled down, and happily resumed a game of toy cars with Tim. The following day, I lost my nerve completely. There is, I discovered, not a lot you can do when you're precariously positioned on a vertical cliff, all confidence drained. I had no limb free, no way of expressing my feelings, apart from tears. I noticed a couple of passers-by stopping to watch me. 'Make those people go away,' I shouted to James. Wisely, he didn't. In the end, I made it to the top, and then to the bottom. That was when the endorphins kicked in. I looked up and told myself, 'I climbed that.' I declared that I would definitely learn to climb once we got home. I haven't. Similarly, I think it's going to be a while before I see my Dad paragliding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
