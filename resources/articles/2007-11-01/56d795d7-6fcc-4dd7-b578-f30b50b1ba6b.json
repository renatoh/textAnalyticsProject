My colleagues are behaving like candidates at an MI5 recruitment open day. People have started glancing over their shoulders as they swipe in; surreptitiously looking to left and right before logging into Hotmail; covering their work with their hands and screaming, \"NO COPYING!\" at passersby (OK, I made that last one up). It's just like an (admittedly not very exciting) episode of Spooks. Although this behaviour sounds bizarre, it seems my office is in good company: most of us believe our bosses are out to get us. Research conducted by Investors in People has found that less than 30% of us trust our manager, 78% say our boss has let us down in the past, and 55% of us reckon the head honcho only has our best interests at heart when it suits her. Unsurprisingly, the longer you stay at a company, the more likely you are to have \"Trust No One\" tattooed on your arm. \u00b7 And it gets worse. Back in the 20th century, people could go out, embarrass themselves, come home and then announce, \"what happens on tour, stays on tour\". Or some other ludicrous phrase. No longer. What with digital technology and blabbermouth friends, it's more like, \"what happens on tour, goes on Facebook, usually before you've managed to piece together exactly what it was that went on in the first place\". Manpower has found that 43% of us would be outraged if an employer used a website to find information on a candidate and 56% think it's unethical. Sadly, nowhere could I find a statistic telling me how many of us have therefore decided to ban digital cameras. Or blabbermouth friends. As it happens, Manpower has no evidence to suggest that employers really are looking on Facebook. But given that the rest of us can't help looking up former flings or passing acquaintances the likelihood is that either they do, would like to or will do as soon as HR leaves the room. \u00b7 Personally, I love a bit of paranoia. I'm happy to believe They are out to get me - what with my desperately important job moving bits of paper around, and my sought-after cubicle in the middle of an open-plan office, it makes sense (and it makes me feel important). In fact, I'd be willing to put all this workplace mistrust down to a heady combination of Newsnight and Heroes - were it not for the fact that our managers really are out to get us. ADP Employer Services has just released data showing that 59% of us have been affected by payroll errors, with 41% of errors resulting in an underpayment (unsurprisingly, the boss overpays a mere 17% of the time). Of course, your boss would argue that it's your own fault, given that 73% of us say we don't understand our payslips anyway. But that's because it's written in secret code. By MI5.
