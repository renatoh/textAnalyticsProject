The list isn't really about quality, but second-guessing what the public are going to buy. It's certainly nice that someone involved in its compilation isn't underestimating the mass market's stomach for left-field electronica. If you were looking to roughly delineate the area in which Blake works, you might consider the two records the DJ plays before he takes the stage tonight: Floating Points' Vacuum Boogie is a club hit from the fertile but unnamed musical region that exists somewhere between dubstep, house and garage, while the late Arthur Russell's This Is How We Walk on the Moon is an abstract, emotionally charged singer-songwriter experiment. But you do wonder at what someone lured in by Blake's Radio One-playlisted cover of Feist's Limit to Your Love \u2013 by some stretch the most commercial thing in his oeuvre \u2013 is going to make of, say, I Never Learnt to Share: an agonised vocal, not a million miles removed from that of Antony of And the Johnsons fame, repeating a single lyric about familial dysfunction over a cloud of abstract synthsesiser noodling. Certainly, stuff like that seems an odd fit in a nightclub. He's accompanied by a guitarist and percussionist, and no one is going to be rooted to the spot by the visual feast that is his live performance, but nor are they going to turn from the stage and dance, not least because his music progresses at two speeds: extremely slow and Theme Tune to Mastermind. That said, Blake's sound is certainly more visceral live than on record, where it has a tendency to float like mist. The bass on Limit to Your Love is so heavy that the air conditioning units rattle, while The Wilhelm Scream bursts unexpectedly into a thrilling crescendo. At its best, Blake's music is so mesmerising that the surroundings don't matter at all. Whether the general public will be willing to let him put them under, however, still seems open to question."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
