But as Holland prepare for the Nations League final against Portugal on Sunday they sense the good times are returning again. \u201cHolland have struggled for the past few years,\u201d says Ryan Babel, one of the team\u2019s elder statesmen at 32. \u201cBut we are slowly coming back to where we belong. And this generation has a lot more potential to grow.\u201d Babel\u2019s eyes light up when he is asked about Matthijs de Ligt, Frenkie de Jong and Donny van de Beek, three dazzling prodigies who have emerged from Ajax. But it is not only their talent that impresses him but their maturity. \u201cWhen I compare them to when I was their age, these players already take so much responsibility,\u201d says Babel. \u201cThey are so mature. For example, De Ligt made a mistake against England but it didn\u2019t affect his confidence. He just carried on doing the same things we asked him to do and made up for his mistake by a goal.\u201d Davy Pr\u00f6pper, who looked a much more progressive player in Holland\u2019s 3-1 win over England than he often does in Brighton\u2019s defensive straitjacket, concurs. \u201cWe have a really young group, with really talented players and at the moment they are making a quick jump in level,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can compete with the best teams in Europe. It\u2019s really brilliant to see.\u201d Both players credit manager Ronald Koeman as another key factor. Babel says: \u201cIf the vision is not right and if the right group of players is not together, it doesn\u2019t come together.\u201d Pr\u00f6pper stresses how much spirit Koeman has added to a team who had failed to qualify for Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup and yet beat France and Germany in the Nations League group stages and England in the semi-final. \u201cWe have a group who have stayed together for most of the games, so you can really build a good spirit,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no magic formula. We lost our opening game against France but there something changed in our heads. After that we played some really good matches.\u201d Portugal will be another step up. The Oranje have won only two of 13 matches against them since 1990, including the Battle of Nuremberg at the 2006 World Cup, which featured four red and 16 yellow cards. Babel, part of the squad that day, is expecting a different game and result. \u201cIt is a big test,\u201d he says. \u201c[Cristiano] Ronaldo is a quality player. But I am confident with our defence that we can make it difficult for him. We will be prepared.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
