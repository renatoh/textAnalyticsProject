A message sent to the recipients of $165m in \"retention payments\" suggested that the attorney general of New York state, Andrew Cuomo, could release a list of names unless employees agreed to hand back their bonuses by last Monday evening. \"Please be aware that we have received assurances from attorney general Cuomo that no names will be released by his office before he completes a security review which is expected to take at least a week,\" said the memo, sent out on Friday by Gary Pasciucco, the head of AIG's financial products arm. The message, revealed by CNBC television tonight, went on to say that returning the money would lift this threat: \"To the extent that we meet certain participation targets, it is not expected that the names would be released, at all.\" By Monday's deadline, 15 of the top 20 bonus recipients in the US had pledged to return their money. The sum recovered amounted to $50m. But a number of holdouts remain, including staff in London where, Cuomo admitted, he has little authority. \"We have a very aggressive theory about our jurisdiction but we don't have a theory that gets us to London.\" AIG's bonuses have sparked a furious public backlash, with anger in political circles that a company could be handing out rewards to senior staff while depending on $150bn of emergency aid from taxpayers to avoid collapse. There was particular outrage that the money went to employees of the company's financial products arm, which pioneered contracts such as credit default swaps that brought AIG to its knees. AIG staff were sensitive about being identified in public, citing security worries. The company's chief executive, Ed Liddy, told Congress last week that AIG had received death threats including an email suggesting that executives and their families should be \"executed with piano wire around their neck\". In Connecticut, where AIG's financial products division is based, a union-backed protest group, Connecticut Working Families, took demonstrators on a bus tour of AIG executives' mansions over the weekend to vent their fury in person. The group's director, Joe Dinkin, yesterday said it was a \"good step\" that half of the money was being repaid but added: \"They're still largely insulated from the economic crisis the rest of us are experiencing. I don't think most of us will ever know what it's like to give back $4m.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
