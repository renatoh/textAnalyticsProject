Megson guided the Baggies to second place in last season's first division, to earn promotion to the Premiership. \"I was asked if I wanted to sign a new contract and I said 'yes,'\" Megson said. \"I am happy with it and the club are happy with it.\" Coventry City's financial problems will become even more acute if they fail to pay Albion the next instalment due for the transfer of Lee Hughes. City, \u00a330m in debt, agreed to pay Albion \u00a35m, payable in three instalments over two years, when they signed Hughes last August. They have already paid \u00a32m but the Coventry chairman Mike McGinnity refused to confirm whether they will be able to meet the payment, which is due on August 8. \"Coventry City's finances will be dealt with behind closed doors,\" he said. Albion refuse to speculate on the situation, including the possibility that they may have to re-sign Hughes to clear the debt. Nwankwo Kanu is keen to hold talks with Arsene Wenger about his future at Arsenal over the next few days after returning to the club for pre-season training. The striker was offered by Wenger to PSV Eindhoven in part exchange for Mark van Bommel this summer and intends to find out whether he will feature prominently next season. \"I hope to discuss my future with the manager,\" he said, \"but at the moment I'm still an Arsenal player.\" Fulham will confirm today that they have signed the defender Martin Djetou on a season's loan from Parma. The 27-year-old Frenchman links up with Jean Tigana for a second time, having been coached by his compatriot at Monaco. Carlisle have been cleared by the Football Association after an investigation into alleged financial irregularities lasting more than two years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
