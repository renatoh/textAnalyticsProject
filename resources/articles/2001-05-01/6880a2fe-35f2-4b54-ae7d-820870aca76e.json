Subs: Dreher, Weisinger, Sforza, Tarnat, Jancker, Zickler, Santa Cruz. Real Madrid: Casillas, Salgado, Carlos, Hierro, Helguera, Raul, McManaman, Figo, Guti, Karanka, Makelele. Subs: Cesar, Morientes, Savio, Campo, Geremi, Conceicao, Munitis. Referee: K Nielsen (Denmark) 1 Bayern go on the attack from the off as Elber powers into the Real half and slides the ball through to Scholl; Scholl gets on top of his shot enabling Casillas to get a hand on the ball. Englishman Hargreaves replaces the suspended Effenberg. 3 Bayern come close again when Hargreaves on the right picks out Elber running clear in the Real half; Casillas spreads himself well to block Elber's shot from the edge of the area. 8 GOAL: Bayern Munich 1 - 0 Real Madrid Corner from the right is missed by Kuffour and bundled into the goalmouth by Jeremies, but it bounces up and comes out off the bar. A scramble, and up it comes again for Elber to nod in from two yards. 11 Booking Helguera, for kicking the ball away in frustration at being called offside. 14 Guti cuts the ball back from the touchline for McManaman to shoot wide. Bayern react to the move in slow motion and McManaman looks surprised to have been given so much space - could explain why he failed to get his shot on target. 18 GOAL: Bayern Munich 1 - 1 Real Madrid Roberto Carlos picks out Raul on the edge of the Bayern area; Raul squares it for Figo to nip in at the near post and put Real back in business. 21 Jeremies lucky to get away with a nasty late and high challenge on Roberto Carlos. 22 Real free-kick over 25 yards out - Figo takes, straight into the wall. 27 Bayern free-kick on the edge of the Real area - Scholl and Jeremies line up, but, after a bit of scrum in the wall, it's Scholl who skys it. 29 Scholl lucky to get away with a deliberate elbow in the face of Salgardo. Interesting to see if he escapes the wrath of Uefa after the game and makes the final should Bayern get through. 33 Scholl's cross just fails to find Elber at the far post after Hargreaves had let rip with 30-yard shot that was blocked. 34 GOAL: Bayern Munich 2 - 1 Real Madrid Lovely goal by Bayern. Karanka the man responsible for a needless foul 25 yards out. Scholl drags his free-kick to Jeremies on his left; Jeremies beats Casillas with a first-time right-foot shot from 20 yards. 38 Real free-kick just over 20 yards out - Roberto Carlos tries to take off a few limbs by slamming it into the wall. 40 Two corners to Real as they step up the pressure; both come to nothing. 45 One minute extra to play as Scholl is chopped down by Hierro - or was he? Hierro would claim Oscars but Bayern get the free-kick 30 yards out - comes to nothing. Half-time. Two goals would seal it for Real, but whichever way you twist it, Bayern are in the driving seat with their collective foot to the floor. 46 Real get the second 45 underway. Bayern the first to make inroads in the opposing penalty area. 48 Bayern having trouble getting the ball out of their own half as Real push up. 49 Makalele goes down bang on the edge of the Bayern area - nothing doing. 50 Real corner - too long, Kahn needlessly puts it behind for another; goes to Roberto Carlos 30 yards out but his lob over the top catches everyone offside. 54 Predictably, Bayern have fallen back but Hierro blows them open with a long ball to Raul 10 yards out; Raul can't control it and puts wide. 55 Bayern break with Salihamidzic as Real find themselves stretched at the back, but he directs his shot straight at Casillas. 58 Real are facing a wall of red as they attempt to claw something back. 59 Substitution Santa Cruz on for Scholl. 61 Substitution Savio on for McManaman. 62 Sloppy defending by Hierro gifts a corner to Bayern... 62 ...Hargreaves takes for Linke to force a save from Casillas with a header from ten yards at the far post. Hargreaves is having a blinder; crucial challenges, probing runs on the right and handy corners. 63 Corner to Real - Bayern clear with ease 66 Morientes on for Karanka. 69 Real corner after Roberto Carlos steams in for a shot from 18 yards only to see it deflected; corner finally cleared by Lizarazu. 70 Substitution Sforza on for Jeremies. 71 Still plenty of traffic in the Bayern half as Real win another corner - short by Savio to Figo, back to Savio as he crosses for Morientes to head over. 78 No change. Ten Bayern players behind the ball as Real come forward again and win a corner - Figo takes and Sforza clears. 81 Bayern still have enough guile to fashion another chance as Elber hits the side-netting. 82 Real corner - Kahn punches clear. Salihamidzic breaks for Bayern and finds Elber on the right, but his cross is poor. 84 Elber gets away from Salgado on the left and spurns the shot from inside the area for pass to Santa Cruz - he gets in a muddle and Bayern clear. 86 Substitution Zickler on for Elber. 87 Salihamidzic and Zickler exchange passes on the edge of the Real area before Hargreaves goes on a run to the left - ends in a Bayern corner as Hargreaves takes the applause again. Hargreaves with the corner - itv goes for another. Zickler gets up for the second, easy for Casillas. 88 Real break and Figo forces a great save from Kahn. 90 Bayern end the game playing for fun... they've got four extra minutes to play for. Bayern win a free-kick 30 yards out - Hargreaves takes and wastes it. It's all over for Real as Lizarazu gets away on the left. Full-time. Bayern have done it, they're in the final, it's victory against Valencia at the San Siro or bust - the Olympic Stadium erupts, foundations in downtown Munich rattle, Beckenbauer smiles. English clubs will be left asking one question after all this - how the hell did we miss this boy Hargreaves?
