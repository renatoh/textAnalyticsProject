Leaving aside the cultural specificity of the word \"shaman\", such people rarely dominate anything. Rather, they can be found living on the edges of societies (even those termed by anthropologists as \"shamanic\") and serving the people rather than dominating them. Cook seems to fall into the trap of condemning all spirituality and religious practice as if it was all of a kind with monotheist religions. The root of this rests with an educational system that fails to give children a vocabulary to express their spirituality, but instead moulds their intrinsic spirit into the straightjacket of monotheistic thought. Breaking away from this can lead one to be overly critical of all religion. She shouldn't confuse a lack of church-going in Britain with a lack of spiritual or religious belief. I suspect that the default human spiritual setting is pantheist; maybe not given much organised ritual expression outside of pagan circles these days, but an enduring spirituality none the less. Ian Iles Taunton, Somerset Margaret Cook is mistaken in equating shamanism with religion as a means of control. Shamans offer a means of making contact with higher levels of consciousness. The problems faced in conventional science stem from its refusal to recognise the existence of realities beyond the abilities of our physical senses to detect.
