The 25-year-old\u2019s career has risen rapidly since graduating from Newcastle University in 2017. That year she won the Woon art prize, then in 2019 had a solo exhibition at the Baltic; she now has works in the current Royal Academy Summer Exhibition and a forthcoming mural commission at Brixton station, south London. At Frieze London last autumn, three of her paintings sold within two hours of the fair\u2019s opening. All of which means she is very busy. Of course she\u2019s spending less time with her peers because of the pandemic, but she is fine with living up to the isolated artist trope. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to focus with fewer social engagements,\u201d she says. My question is partly sisterly concern. I think back to private views, biennales and gallery weekends that I\u2019ve attended without another black person in sight. This is familiar territory for Labinjo. Her work, mostly large-scale, colourful, striking portraits inspired by archival family photographs, initially stemmed from the absence of black people in her academic environment and the teaching material. \u201cWhat I was being taught wasn\u2019t broad enough,\u201d she says. \u201cI first started using family photographs when I was at Newcastle \u2013 it was the easiest way for me to access the black figure.\u201d She initially planned to write her dissertation on the Young British Artists but changed her mind after discovering artists such as Lubaina Himid, Keith Piper, Donald Rodney and Sonia Boyce, who were associated with the British black art movement of the 80s. \u201cWhat interested me about them was their energy and perseverance,\u201d she says. \u201cHow they teamed up, had so many knock-backs, had exhibitions in corridors! When I was writing my dissertation, Brexit was happening, the far right was gaining prominence in the UK, so it felt like the things these artists were making work about in the 1980s were happening again,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were so bold. How Eddie Chambers ripped the flag up in Destruction of the National Front, I was like: \u2018Yes!\u2019 It was what I needed at the time.\u201d Labinjo was born and raised in Dagenham, east London, to Nigerian parents. Her paintings are rooted in her heritage, from vividly capturing traditional west African patterned attire to her depiction of culturally intimate scenes, but her work has recently taken a new direction. \u201cAfter the Baltic exhibition, I knew I wanted to step back from family photos because I didn\u2019t want that to be my whole practice,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to paint my friends. I wanted to paint people of all races.\u201d One of the paintings at the RA is titled Breakfast With Violet and Adam and is thematically and stylistically different from her older works. \u201cI pushed myself to paint things I wouldn\u2019t normally. So the plates, the glass, the salt and pepper shaker. I painted her wispy hair, her freckles. It was a challenge for me, but I really enjoyed it.\u201d But then George Floyd was killed; and a video emerged of a white woman calling the police after a minor altercation with a black man in New York\u2019s Central Park; in London a Metropolitan police officer was filmed apparently kneeling on a black suspect\u2019s neck during an arrest, and the athlete Bianca Williams was stopped, searched and handcuffed. These incidents deeply affected Labinjo and caused a sudden change of heart. \u201cIn the grand scheme of things, I don\u2019t know if that work is important,\u201d she says, reflecting on the paintings featured in the Summer Exhibition. \u201cIt might have been more special to have had portraits of black people taking up space there. Portraits of white people exist in so many institutions.\u201d Labinjo channelled her anger and the energy from photographing scenes at Black Lives Matter protests in London into a new series of paintings, much darker in tone, featuring police officers, protesters and businessmen. \u201cI still wanted to paint white people just to prove that I could, but this time they could be the butt of the joke. I\u2019m using them as characters to talk about racism as a structure. So when white people appear in the paintings, they are quite humorous,\u201d she says. \u201cThe other works speak to the effects of colonialism. In Britain, a lot of people honestly don\u2019t know about the empire and how Britain\u2019s wealth was accumulated. To an extent, it\u2019s not their fault, because we were not taught about it in school. If, as a country, we understood the atrocities that have taken place, it would provide context.\u201d Labinjo is a part of a new wave of artists of African origin who are coming to prominence. While she doesn\u2019t believe that there is a defined \u201cblack\u201d aesthetic, she has noticed similarities between her work and other contemporary figurative painters. \u201cThere are maybe 10 artists, including Amoako Boafo, Toyin Ojih Odutola, Njideka Akunyili Crosby and Kudzanai-Violet Hwami whose work is less photo-realistic, less expressive, but has lots of colour. This whole flatness, the way we see colour \u2013 some people are perhaps doing it to look good digitally.\u201d Labinjo\u2019s paintings are often constructed from collages she creates digitally using images sourced from Instagram, furniture websites, catalogues and personal and local archives. Attention to detail is something she takes pride in, even down to her tools and materials. \u201cThe paint I use is all one brand: Michael Harding. Brushes are really important, too. I always need to buy lots of the smaller brushes as I get through those quickly. Using angled flat brushes is how I get the chiselled look.\u201d When she\u2019s not making art, Labinjo is reading, watching and listening, from Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other to Candice Brathwaite\u2019s I Am Not Your Baby Mother to Michaela Coel\u2019s I May Destroy You. \u201cI was also inspired by Michaela Coel\u2019s MacTaggart lecture, which reinforced that people take in stories easier than hardcore political messages. She didn\u2019t use words like race and class, she just told stories. It made me realise what a powerful medium storytelling is.\u201d Though she has a solo show opening at Tiwani Contemporary in London in December Labinjo, does not take success for granted. She recently enrolled on the MFA programme at Oxford University\u2019s Ruskin School of Art. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I studied in Vienna for a semester that I gained some self-belief. Everyone in the UK was like: \u2018You\u2019re doing a Mickey Mouse degree.\u2019 But in Vienna, it was a really valued subject. It was respected.\u201d What does she make of the government\u2019s skills assessment initiative, which has been encouraging artists to retrain in other professions? \u201cIt\u2019s quite funny \u2013 they\u2019re telling artists to retrain, when most artists do other things anyway. Very few artists get to just do their art.\u201d According to a 2018 survey, 60% of artists have to take second jobs in order to pay the bills. \u201cIn some ways I think it takes more to shut creative people down because by 18, you\u2019re already very invested. But maybe 14, 15-year-olds might think they\u2019re going to pick different GCSEs. My flatmate works for an education charity helping kids after school apply to university. A lot of working-class and BAME people don\u2019t want to go into the arts because their families have been struggling their whole lives and they don\u2019t want to struggle further.\u201d Labinjo says a world without art would be bleak, and it\u2019s hard to disagree. \u201cWe see through the pandemic, life is hard for people, and it is art, TV, online theatre, films, that get people through. From a book cover to a cereal box to TV shows, to the adverts between the TV shows to the music we listen to. I don\u2019t think people realise how important art is. \u201cWhen I\u2019m painting I feel happy and alive,\u201d Labinjo adds fervently. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m not present. If you call my name, I\u2019m not there. That feeling of being transported somewhere else \u2013 that\u2019s when I know I\u2019ve hit the mark.\u201d \u2022 Joy Labinjo\u2019s solo exhibition is at Tiwani Contemporary, London, from 2 December \u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2020 to correct the spelling of artist Amoako Boafo\u2019s name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
