It takes even more to hang on to it in the face of not one but two catastrophic sporting defeats. A week ago today Les Bleus, the French rugby team, suffered collective stage fright in the inaugural match of the World Cup and endured a pounding by the Argentinians in front of a capacity crowd in the Stade de France (helpfully, the collection of useful French phrases given away free to World Cup visitors translates \"we're going to celebrate\" from Spanish to French). Then on Wednesday night Les Bleus, the French soccer team, were beaten by Scotland, France dropping from top to a lowly third in their Euro 2008 qualifier group. This has all come after the gloom of the Tour de France - no French rider in the top 20 - but the French media has responded with extraordinary sympathy, a sympathy all the more remarkable when President Sarkozy has invested so much political capital in his promise to restore La Gloire to every aspect of French life. He has made the national rugby team's manager, Bernard Laporte, a junior sports minister, and even, in a final challenge to destiny, acknowledged that if Les Bleus (rugby) lose, he will be blamed. The expectation of national glory plainly gives a self-confidence robust enough to survive mere sporting troubles. Or perhaps once again the coq sportif will rediscover his flare when, as the saying goes, he is most deeply in the mire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
