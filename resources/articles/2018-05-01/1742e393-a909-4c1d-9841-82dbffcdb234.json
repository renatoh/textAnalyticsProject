And not to write to my mother describing acts of anal sex under any circumstances whatsoever.\u201d Ah, the perils of taking a younger lover. So malleable in some ways (\u201cHop on to all fours, there\u2019s a good chap. That always works best, don\u2019t you think?\u201d) and so thoroughly wayward in others. Most times, both parties manage to extricate themselves and walk away unharmed. Things are trickier, alas, if you are the new Liberal leader, set fair to transform your party from cranky, faddist, po-faced no-mark into legitimate power player, and tear asunder the duopoly enjoyed by the Tories and Labour for half a century by a blessed concatenation of political circumstances and the sheer force of your wickedly clever, devilishly funny, perennially media-ready personality. Such is the problem facing Jeremy Thorpe by the end of the opening episode of Russell T Davies\u2019s frankly brilliant A Very English Scandal \u2013 a three-part dramatisation of events leading up to Thorpe\u2019s infamous 1979 trial for conspiracy to murder his troubled and increasingly troublesome young boyfriend, Norman Scott. Hugh Grant plays Thorpe and \u2013 clearly having the time of his actorly life \u2013 is revelatory. Charming, sly, duplicitous, forthright, manipulative, sometimes by turns, sometimes all at once, he is never less than wholly convincing and compelling. Everything (bar the stutter) that made him a romcom star is still there, but now there is everything else too. He handles the comic scenes and moments, which are sprinkled liberally throughout, with the deftness you\u2019d expect, but never loses sight of the underlying nervousness, fear and venality underlying the politician\u2019s moves. Discussing with best friend Peter Bessell (Alex Jennings, brilliant as a devotee with a shadow on his soul) his need to marry in order to progress in politics (\u201cYou\u2019ll need to find a girl who\u2019s led \u2026 a sheltered life\u201d), he is part shark \u2013 always moving forward lest he founder and die \u2013 and part snake, shedding old skins and growing new ones as the moment dictates, and always so wry and rogueish with it that you find yourself thinking that whoever she turns out to be, she could do worse. You might not have a lot of sex, but you would have an endlessly good time. Poor, unstable, neurotic Norman \u2013 born Josiffe, renamed Scott when he relocates to Dublin and a modelling career seems to be taking off \u2013 is played with his customary delicate depth by Ben Whishaw. (There is no sign of Benedict Cumberbatch, but the smart money says he cameos at some point as Rinka the great dane, killed \u2013 to the public\u2019s horror \u2013 as the conspirators\u2019 net closes around Scott). Scott is, at first, as Thorpe notes, \u201ca very heaven\u201d. Scott idolises Thorpe, who gives him a flat, money and a nickname \u2013 Bunny \u2013 that will one day be known, as nicknames between lovers never should, nationwide. Scott becomes resentful of the time Thorpe spends away from him and fixates on his refusal to get him a new insurance card so he can claim benefits and secure his prescription medications. When their relationship disintegrates past the point of no return, Scott tells the police Thorpe made him \u201ca victim of his lusts\u201d and provides private letters as evidence. \u201cBunnies can and will go to Paris!\u201d says one that encloses tickets to France. \u201cThat\u2019s proof enough, isn\u2019t it?\u201d says Scott, who is quite as astute as Thorpe in his own way. It is passed from the Met to Scotland Yard to Special Branch and finally to MI5, where a wise man places it silently in a safe and waits for its time to come. By the end of the first episode, it nearly has. Thorpe\u2019s political star is rising \u2013 via several pro-European, pro-immigration and other progressive speeches that chime with the likely viewer\u2019s likely sympathies and complicate our reactions as his mood darkens towards his ex-lover, whose proclamations are increasingly insistent, and one hellish solution to the now unheavenly body that torments him presents itself. It is a drama as brutally funny, endlessly clever, justifiably confident as its protagonist; an immaculately-scripted hour that entwines two decades of salient political history with a finely-worked portrait of the English establishment, shaping and being shaped by a certain kind of man protected by certain privileges and labouring under a particular kind of fear. The era\u2019s moves to legalise homosexuality and the European and immigration concerns playing out in the background give the broader moment resonance, but it is the superlative work from Jennings, Whishaw and above all Grant\u2019s tour de force that holds it together, humanises and makes sense of it all. Bravo et encore. Bunnies can and will go to the Baftas, I\u2019m sure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
