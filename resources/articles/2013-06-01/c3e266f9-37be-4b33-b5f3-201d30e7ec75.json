The IPPR thinktank also recommends providing ministers with a larger \"extended office\" that would be made up of mixture of political advisers and non-partisan outside experts, as well as career civil servants. The report ordered by the Cabinet Office minister, Francis Maude, suggests there is cross-party frustration at aspects of civil service accountability. Maude gave the report a strong welcome, and it is likely at the very least to be the basis for the next stage of his reform agenda. In a proposal that would change the Whitehall accountability structure, the prime minister would appoint the senior permanent secretary posts on four-year terms, drawing on a list prepared by the civil service commission and reflecting the views of the relevant secretary of state. At present the appointment is made by the civil service commission, and the prime minister has a veto. The report also suggests the head of the civil service should be made a full-time post, and be responsible for line-managing and holding permanent secretaries accountable for their performance. The current civil service chief, Sir Bob Kerslake, is also a departmental permanent secretary. The report also proposes that senior officials responsible for the delivery of government programmes should be directly accountable to relevant departmental select committees in parliament in their own right, and not just as spokespeople for their ministers. At present many civil servants hide behind the doctrine of ministerial accountability to refuse to answer questions in a straightforward way. In another groundbreaking suggestion it proposes civil servants should second officials to opposition parties ahead of elections in order to help them with policy development. At present civil servants a few months out from an election merely have a conversation with the opposition to familiarise themselves with its thinking, but not to give very specific advice. The recommendations, which are based on a study of leading international civil service systems, including countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada, will be scrutinised to see if they undermine the political independence of the civil service. . The direct prime ministerial appointment of Whitehall permanent secretaries may be seen as liable to undermine the authority of the head of the civil service. The proposals may also prompt claims that civil servants will feel accountable to politicians and not to their internal leadership. But many politicians argue that in practice senior civil servants quit if it is seen their face does not fit with a new political regime, and it is better for both sides to have a more explicit relationship in which civil servants are more directly accountable to their elected political masters. Reforms have been made to the appointment of permanent secretaries in recent months to give the elected secretary of state greater input, but these proposed reforms by handing responsibility to the prime minister go substantially further. The former home office minister, Nick Herbert, said: \"This report itself shows the benefits of reform \u2013 going outside the civil service for policy advice has produced suggestions for more effective government that simply wouldn't have come from within. \"These ideas are a welcome step forward but we need to go further to create proper accountability and bring in external expertise. The risk isn't politicisation \u2013 it's today's suboptimal administration that doesn't answer to anyone.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
