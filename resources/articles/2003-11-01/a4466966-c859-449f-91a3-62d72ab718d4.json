In its first review of initial teacher training for FE, the official watchdog on education standards found that courses rarely do enough to show trainees how to teach their subjects, and are not geared to the wide ability range of trainees. Inspectors found that some trainees - a third of whom lack a GCSE grade C in English and maths - struggle to cope with higher education-level work while others find it \"insufficiently demanding\". The publication of the Ofsted report on the first day of the Association of Colleges' annual conference took the shine off an attempt by Alan Johnson, minister for further and higher education, to sing up perceived improvements since the government launched it FE reforms - Success For All - a year ago, including in the quality of teaching. If the unfortunate coincidence was an indictment on government news management, it did no harm to Ofsted's claim to be independent. In the absence of the cash that some of his recent predecessors have flourished at AoC conferences, Mr Johnson had to rely on warm words about the sector's recent improvements and a reiteration of government's belated recognition of its importance. An audience of the nation's college principals gave a muted response to his announcement that 90% of \"provision in colleges\" is satisfactory or better, and that their success rates - students achieving what they enrol to do - have risen from 59% in 2000/01 to 65% in 2001/02. The minister reminded the conference that this time last year Labour had committed \"record extra funding\" to further education and immediately acknowledged that some of this had been \"partly offset\" by national insurance, pensions and other costs. \"These factors will be less of a problem in 2004/5,\" he said, without explaining why this should be so. \"I acknowledge therefore that as we meet today many colleges still face difficulties with funding,\" he said. \"I will not mislead you by giving you the impression that there are additional resources we can put in centrally.\" Mr Johnson said the public spending priority must be on funding a universal adult entitlement to free tuition for a level two qualification (five GCSEs grade A to C), and he reiterated the increasingly clear aim to get other adult students, and employers, to pay more for further education. \"Within a given budget of public funds, it will require a more robust approach to raising income in fees and employer contributions.\" What the minister could offer his audience was consultations. He announced a \"far reaching consultation on the future training and education of FE teachers\". This will consider their entitlement to training, which is tailor-made for what they will be teaching, and to mentoring which is specific to their subject. And he declared therewill be, later this month, a consultation on value-added measures for further education."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
