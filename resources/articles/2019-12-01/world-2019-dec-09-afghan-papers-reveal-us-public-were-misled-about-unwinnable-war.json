Transcripts of the interviews, published by the Washington Post after a three-year legal battle, were collected for a Lessons Learned project by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar), a federal agency whose main task is eliminating corruption and inefficiency in the US war effort. The 2,000 pages of documents reveal the bleak and unvarnished views of many insiders in a war that has cost $1tn (\u00a3760bn) and killed more than 2,300 US servicemen and women, with more than 20,000 injured. Tens of thousands of Afghan civilians have died in the conflict. The documents have echoes of the Pentagon Papers \u2013 the US military\u2019s secret history of the Vietnam war that were leaked in 1971 and told a similarly troubling story of the cover-up of military failure. Negotiations are taking place between the Trump administration and the Taliban as the US debates whether to withdraw 13,000 troops who remain in Afghanistan. The interviews were collected, beginning in 2014, in addition to Sigar\u2019s regular audits to identify what could be learned from successive policy failures in Afghanistan. While many of the failures of the war in Afghanistan have been exposed by Sigar\u2019s work, often in highly technical reports, the cache of interviews offers an easily accessible fly-on-the-wall account. In his own damning intervention John Sopko, the head of Sigar, told the paper the assessments contained in the project suggested that \u201cthe American people have constantly been lied to\u201d. Two major claims in the documents are that US officials manipulated statistics to suggest to the American public that the war was being won and that successive administrations turned a blind eye to widespread corruption among Afghan officials, allowing the theft of US aid with impunity. The long-term nature of the manipulation of statistics was detailed in an interview with an individual identified only as a senior \u201cNational Security Council official\u201d. \u201cIt was impossible to create good metrics. We tried using troop numbers trained, violence levels, control of territory and none of it painted an accurate picture,\u201d the official told interviewers in 2016. \u201cThe metrics were always manipulated for the duration of the war.\u201d The papers depict the view of many people of a conflict with vague and unachievable war aims, pursued under three US presidents, George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump, whose alleged successes were presented repeatedly in inflated terms. In one scathing assessment Douglas Lute, a lieutenant general who served as the White House Afghan war tsar during the George W Bush and Barack Obama administrations, told interviewers in 2015: \u201cWe were devoid of a fundamental understanding of Afghanistan \u2013 we didn\u2019t know what we were doing.\u201d Speaking frankly, like other interviewees, on the understanding that what he was saying at the time was confidential, he added: \u201cWhat are we trying to do here? We didn\u2019t have the foggiest notion of what we were undertaking. \u201cIf the American people knew the magnitude of this dysfunction \u2026 2,400 lives lost.\u201d In another interview Jeffrey Eggers, a retired Navy Seal and White House staffer for Bush and Obama, said: \u201cWhat did we get for this $1tn effort? Was it worth $1tn? \u201cAfter the killing of Osama bin Laden, I said that Osama was probably laughing in his watery grave considering how much we have spent on Afghanistan.\u201d Some of those interviewed by the Sigar project went even further, suggesting a deliberate effort to alter statistics on the war to suggest to the American public that it was being won. \u201cEvery data point was altered to present the best picture possible,\u201d said Bob Crowley, an army colonel who served as a senior counterinsurgency adviser to US military commanders in 2013 and 2014. \u201cSurveys, for instance, were totally unreliable but reinforced that everything we were doing was right and we became a self-licking ice-cream cone.\u201d The documents, obtained after the Washington Post twice went to federal courts to ask for the interview transcripts, identify only 62 of the people interviewed. A total of 366 other names were redacted after Sigar insisted they should be treated as whistleblowers and informants. Commentators and foreign policy experts were quick to point to the importance of the documents, with many drawing a link with the Pentagon Papers. The veteran US documentary-maker Ken Burns, who recently chronicled the Vietnam War, remarked on Twitter: \u201cMark Twain often said that \u2018history doesn\u2019t repeat itself but it often rhymes.\u2019 \u2018The Afghanistan Papers\u2019 and \u2018The Pentagon Papers\u2019 certainly rhyme in that sense.\u201d The NPR host Lulu Garcia-Navarro tweeted: \u201cStunning. The new Pentagon Papers describe explicit and sustained efforts by the US government to deliberately mislead the public.\u201d. Some were even more succinct. \u201cWars breed lies,\u201d tweeted Katrina vanden Heuvel, the publisher of the progressive magazine the Nation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
