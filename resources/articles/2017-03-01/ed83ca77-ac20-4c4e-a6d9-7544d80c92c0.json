Arsenal eased past Lincoln City at the Emirates with a few gears to spare on Saturday afternoon. But rather than styling victory as a return to form Wenger was adamant his team had simply carried on their fine performance in the midweek thrashing that ended their Champions League campaign. \u201cWe played an outstanding game against Bayern Munich but our game was killed by the referee,\u201d Wenger said, his team having swamped a gallant Lincoln during a second half in which they scored four goals. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this game three times and our game was killed by the referee. \u201d \u201cThe first defeat in Bayern I accept, but the last one against Bayern when you are down to 10 men against a team of that quality and you then concede a penalty, it is not a football game any more. The players didn\u2019t let me down, or themselves or the club. It was an outstanding performance as long as we were 11 versus 11.\u201d There were words of praise too for Arsenal\u2019s National League opponents at the Emirates who produced an excellent, disciplined display in the opening 40 minutes, but were picked apart as Arsenal began to pass and move with more fluency. \u201cIt was difficult, you could see in the first half they had a very direct game but they had clarity about what they wanted to do and they did that very well. Overall it was important for us not to make a mistake. They had a big crowd behind them as well \u2013 they had a chance.\u201d Lincoln\u2019s likable, hugely talkative manager Danny Cowley was left to rue Petr Cech\u2019s fine save from Nathan Arnold in the first half (\u201cthat goes in in the National League\u201d) but was visibly moved by his team\u2019s achievement in playing at this late stage of the competition. \u201cWe tried to press hard from restarts, we knew we couldn\u2019t press them all game, they\u2019re too good at possession,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second half it felt like he\u2019d brought 15 players, it felt like the clock had stopped. That was one hell of a long 45 minutes for us.\u201d There was support also from Cowley for Wenger at the end of a difficult week. He said: \u201cPeople criticise Ars\u00e8ne Wenger but anyone who really knows football, you see the way those players move, how they understand space, and that comes from good coaching. Any manager who has stood the test of time as long as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has deserves complete and utter respect as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
