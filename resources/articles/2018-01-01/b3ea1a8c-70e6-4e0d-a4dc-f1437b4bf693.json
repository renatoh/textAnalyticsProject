Speaking on the day he was presented as Mark Hughes\u2019s successor, Lambert also defended his record as Aston Villa manager and pointed to his time as a player at Borussia Dortmund as evidence that he can prove people wrong. Out of work since leaving Wolves in the summer, Lambert gave the impression that he was determined to make the most of an unexpected opportunity after Stoke missed out on their top three managerial targets. Gary Rowett, Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores and Martin O\u2019Neill were ahead of Lambert on the shortlist but decided that the Stoke job was not for them. Lambert, on the other hand, did not need to think twice. \u201cI see it as a great opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought I would get the chance to get back to this level. Whether I was 50th or first choice, it never really mattered to me. I\u2019m honoured to be here and can\u2019t wait to get started. Everybody knows it\u2019s a real stable club \u2013 only two managers in 12 years.\u201d Although Stoke\u2019s supporters seem uninspired by the decision to appoint Lambert, the club\u2019s directors are not overly concerned by that reaction. They point to the fact that Tony Pulis and Hughes went on to enjoy success despite being unpopular choices and insist that Lambert came across extremely well during his interview. From Lambert\u2019s point of view, any negativity towards him is seen in a wider context. \u201cI\u2019ve never been spoon-fed for my whole career, I have always done it the hard way as a player and a manager. I went to Borussia Dortmund on trial with a bag and some clothes, not knowing what my next move was going to be. I played four trial games and Mr [Ottmar Hitzfeld] said: \u2018You\u2019ve done all right, do you want a contract?\u2019 Then I played against Bayer Leverkusen and the career took off and a year later I was winning the European Cup, so it\u2019s not bad.\u201d As for his managerial record, Lambert highlighted the fact that Norwich finished joint-10th in the Premier League under him and clearly feels that his time at Villa, where he was sacked after the club dropped into the relegation zone during his third season, should be seen in a different light in the context of their struggles since. \u201cIt\u2019s people\u2019s perceptions that maybe I didn\u2019t do a good job at Aston Villa. But I think Aston Villa were only ever once in the bottom three and that was towards the end. The [financial] constraints there were certainly a bit different.\u201d With Stoke in 18th place and games running out, Lambert needs to make an impact quickly. He talked about playing \u201c15 cup finals\u201d between now and the end of the season and was bullish about their prospects. \u201cI\u2019m 100% sure we\u2019ve got more than enough to stay up,\u201d he said. Money is available in the transfer market but work will also need to be done on the training ground to address the defensive weaknesses that have led to 50 goals being conceded. \u201cWe have to stop that,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cWe have to be more resolute in what we\u2019re doing, stronger and more aggressive with it, and if we do that we\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ve got one of the best goalkeepers in Europe at the minute \u2013 looking at him [Jack Butland], he\u2019s been exceptional.\u201d The fight for survival starts with Huddersfield\u2019s visit on Saturday. \u201cYou are where you are for a reason and sometimes you can sleepwalk into things when you think everything is a bed of roses and: \u2018Oh we fell into that trap,\u2019\u201d Lambert said, reflecting on Stoke\u2019s predicament. \u201cMark did a great job here and there are some really talented footballers, but maybe as a group they just fell below the standard they set beforehand. It\u2019s up to me to get them back to that standard.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
