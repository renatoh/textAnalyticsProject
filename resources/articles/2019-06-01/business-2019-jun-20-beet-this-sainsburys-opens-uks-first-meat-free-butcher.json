The store \u2013 kitted out like a traditional butcher with strings of (veggie) sausages hanging in the window \u2013 is a three day-long initiative by the supermarket giant Sainsbury\u2019s to show vegan food has moved on from worthy plates of lentils and brown rice. Despite the soaring popularity of \u201cflexitarian\u201d diets \u2013 where a largely vegetable-based diet is supplemented occasionally with meat \u2013 and the growing trend for consuming meat alternatives and plant-based eating, a poll of 2,000 consumers commissioned by Sainsbury\u2019s found more than half of Britons have never tried a plant-based alternative to meat. The survey also revealed that a fifth of those who considered themselves to be meat eaters regarded plant-based foods as \u201crabbit food\u201d. But what is billed as the UK\u2019s first ever meat-free butchers aims to change that view. The window is filled with slabs of steak (albeit made from soya and wheat protein), jackfruit quarter pounders and chorizo-style \u201cshroomdogs\u201d without the chorizo. Inside, behind the counter, Anthony Maynard, the meat-free butcher, is ready to coax shoppers to try \u201csweet and smoky\u201d BBQ pulled jackfruit as opposed to pork and Moroccan \u201cvegbabs\u201d. Wrong-footed shoppers looking for the real thing will be left disappointed but Maynard is unapologetic: \u201cI have got sausages \u2013 they just haven\u2019t got any meat in them.\u201d On Thursday afternoon \u2013 before it had even opened \u2013 the store had already become a curiosity among passing shoppers. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said John Roberts, out shopping with his wife Helen. \u201cA butcher is a butcher \u2026 you expect it [to] come with meat.\u201d But Roberts had already texted a picture of the store front to his vegetarian son: \u201cIt\u2019s changing times.\u201d A recent YouGov poll showed that for the first time, the majority of the UK population (52%) are reducing their meat consumption, while only 4% are strict vegetarians and 2% vegans. Sainsbury\u2019s says it has seen a 65% increase in sales of plant-based products this year compared with 2018. This shift in attitude has seen manufacturers, supermarkets and restaurants scramble to cash in on the burgeoning vegan market. Consumer goods giant Unilever has bought meat-substitute company The Vegetarian Butcher and the UK\u2019s first 100% vegan hotel has opened in the Highlands. This year also saw Greggs launch a vegan sausage roll that was so popular the high street baker has said its annual profits will now be higher than expected. Earlier this week Tesco, the UK\u2019s biggest retailer, also announced a major push into the market with a new ready meals brand \u2013 Plant Chef - that would result in a tenfold increase in its vegan range to up to 300 different items. James Hamilton, a Sainsbury\u2019s buyer tasked with developing the supermarket\u2019s meat-free product range, said selling plant-based versions of traditional meal time favourites like burgers, sausages and mince helped remove some of the mystique around cooking with exotic ingredients like jackfruit and tofu. \u201cWhilst we\u2019re seeing a huge climb in sales of our plant-based foods, we know from conversations with customers that there is a sense of trepidation about cooking with them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about familiarity. People see tofu and are not sure what to with it but if you see veggie mince it is is simple to communicate what to do with it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
