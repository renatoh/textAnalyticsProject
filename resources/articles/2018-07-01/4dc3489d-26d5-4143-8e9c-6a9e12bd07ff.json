Guardian Australia reported on Friday that Australian consulting firm Sinclair Knight Merz engaged in the \u201csophisticated\u201d bribery of high-ranking Vietnam officials to secure work on World Bank-funded aid projects. The firm is also facing criminal prosecution in Australia for conspiring to bribe officials in Vietnam and the Philippines in a period spanning more than a decade. At the same time, SKM was making significant gains from the Australian government\u2019s foreign aid program, securing 83 contracts worth $489m on projects across the Asia-Pacific. The shadow justice minister, Clare O\u2019Neill, said Labor would introduce the \u201ctoughest anti-bribery laws in Australia\u2019s history\u201d. O\u2019Neill said Labor would bring in a debarment scheme that would prevent companies involved in foreign bribery from being awarded any further work with the Australian government. The scheme, by shutting companies out of lucrative government contracts, creates a more severe financial punishment for foreign bribery. \u201cLabor will crack down on companies doing the wrong thing,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cWe will implement stronger enforcement mechanisms and introduce a debarment scheme to ban crooked companies from government contracts.\u201d \u201cWe take corporate crime seriously. We believe more must be done to ensure companies doing the wrong thing are caught and brought to justice.\u201d The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, did not respond to requests for comment. SKM, a firm that has since been bought out, first self-reported evidence of its corruption to the World Bank in 2012. The World Bank holds an information sharing agreement covering integrity cases with the Australian government, making it likely that information on SKM\u2019s actions would have been shared. Despite this, SKM continued to be awarded contracts with the Australian government, including through the foreign aid program, until the end of 2013. Anti-corruption group Transparency International has long called for a debarment regime in Australia. TI Australia\u2019s chief executive, Serena Lillywhite, told Guardian Australia last week that a debarment scheme was needed to strengthen Australia\u2019s anti-bribery regime. \u201cCurrently, there are no transparent policies or guidelines for the debarment of companies or indeed individuals who engaged in foreign bribery associated with Australian government contracts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the view of Transparency International Australia that we need a transparent debarment regime for all government procurement agencies. This was in fact recommended by the OECD during their assessment of Australia as part of our compliance with the OECD regime.\u201d Lillywhite also called for greater resources for the Australian federal police, to help improve the prospects of successful prosecutions in what are often complex cross-border cases. The criminal case against SKM is still before the courts. The firm no longer exists, but the company that bought it out, US consulting giant Jacobs, has distanced itself from SKM\u2019s past actions. \u201cThe activities reported to authorities by SKM date as far back as 18 years ago, long before Jacobs acquired SKM in December 2013,\u201d a Jacobs spokeswoman said. \u201cIn no way does that conduct reflect the ethical business standards and practices of Jacobs.\u201d \u2022 This reporting is supported by the Susan McKinnon Foundation through the Guardian Civic Journalism Trust"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
