In this recent Vice magazine interview he admits a similarity in the \"scope of society through the classes\" covered by The Wire and Charles Dickens, but says he feels his treatment of the theme has more in common with Tolstoy and Balzac. The thing that made me laugh about it with Dickens was that Dickens is famous for being passionate about showing you the fault lines of industrial England and where money and power route themselves away from the poor. He would make the case for a much better social compact than existed in Victorian England, but then his verdict would always be: \"But thank God a nice old uncle or this heroic lawyer is going to make things better.\" In the end, the guy would punk out. As such, throughout season five the term \"Dickensian\" is used in a mocking manner to pour scorn on the journalistic values of senior Baltimore Sun editor James Whiting. As Simon says in the same Vice interview: \"There was a little bit of tongue-in-cheek satire on the show directed at people who were using Dickens to praise us.\" (Just to be clear: he's using the word to mock not his critics \u2013 but his supporters! Sometimes Simon seems to embody an inversion of a well-known NME cliche: \"I just do what I do, and if nobody else likes it, it's a bonus.\") Certainly there are points where The Wire parts ways with Dickens. Despite the links between the various strands of society shown on the programme \u2013 drug crews, docks, newspapers, police etc \u2013 it largely avoids the sort of outrageous coincidences that Dickens routinely relies on, and sentimentality \u2013 another Dickens staple \u2013 is in the main absent from The Wire, although it does creep in a bit towards the end, the death of Bodie (\"You're a soldier\") being the most glaring example. And Simon's point about the \"nice old uncle\" is a good illustration of the difference between the way Dickens resolves his storylines and the deterministic, cyclical view of life The Wire puts forward, as we have discussed before. There are exceptions, though, for both Dickens and The Wire, Poot at work in Foot Locker in this week's episode being one (although some readers of this blog consider that a pretty tragic fate). Dickens's rather atypical novel A Tale of Two Cities perhaps comes closest to the sensibility of The Wire in its willingness to criticise both the social structure of pre-revolutionary France and the cruelty and brutality of the society that replaces it, an even-handedness and unwillingness to plump for pat solutions that echoes The Wire's treatment of the drugs-tolerance zone Hamsterdam. But there are undeniable similarities between Dickens's writing and that of Simon and his colleague Ed Burns, and the most obvious is surely their shared grand theme: social reform. Dickens is consistently concerned with the working conditions of the poor, especially children (Hard Times, David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, Little Dorrit), the calcification of the class structure (Great Expectations, Hard Times), the complex, bureaucratic and unsatisfactory nature of the legal system (Great Expectations, Bleak House), and a wish to humanise the underclass (Oliver Twist). All find a modern-day, American echo in the Wire. Similar too is the sense that the work is on one level social realism intended to have a genuine impact on public opinion and on policymakers \u2013 Dickens's prison scenes in The Pickwick Papers are said to have inspired the closure of the Fleet Prison, while Oliver Twist is credited with resulting in the clearance of the London slum Jacob's Island. Simon has \u2013 probably rightly \u2013 played down the possibility of The Wire having any such direct impact on drugs policy, its most obvious polemical target, but the programme is clearly structured to raise questions about the real world in the viewer of the fictional one. In order to make these points, both Dickens and Simon/Burns construct an entire culture from the ground up, from the lowest criminals to the highest reaches of the upper class, from Soho in A Tale of Two Cities (\"There were few buildings then, north of the Oxford road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild-flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields\") to \"the great black dome of St Paul's bulging at me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison\" in Great Expectations, and, further afield, \"the dark flat wilderness \u2026 intersected with dykes and mounds and gates\" of the Kent marshes. The Wire's Baltimore has a similar scope: I'm reminded of those strangely beautiful images of industrial decay in series two, the blinking skyscrapers behind Carcetti when he hears he has has won the primary, the rows of desperate, boarded-up houses that appear throughout, D'Angelo's orange sofa at the heart of \"the pit\", and the wildly different homes of McNulty, Daniels, Michael and Stringer Bell. Dickens and Simon also share a delight in language. With Dickens, this finds its best-known expression in his characters' evocative, pungent names \u2013 Bob Cratchit, Uriah Heap, Lady Dedlock \u2013 but more interesting for our purposes is his fidelity to his lower-class characters' speech patterns, which obviously echoes the lovingly transcribed slang of Baltimore's various subcultures in The Wire, most especially and obviously the black street characters. For every \"Feel me?\", \"parlay\" and \"game done changed\" in The Wire, there is Magwitch saying \"What fat cheeks you ha' got \u2026 Darn me if I couldn't eat 'em, and if I hadn't half a mind to't!\" in Great Expectations, or Bill Sikes muttering, \"Come on, you sneaking warmint\" in Oliver Twist. In addition, The Wire shares a formal structure with Dickens's work. The serialised form of 19th century authors such as Dickens and Alexandre Dumas \u2013 according to Time magazine, ships arriving in New York harbour with the latest chapter of The Old Curiosity Shop were greeted with cries of: \"Is Little Nell dead?\" \u2013 finds its modern equivalent in Simon's weekly \"television novel\". But whether The Wire is a successful example of this serialised, episodic form is open for debate; the programme seems to be much more successful as one of a new breed of made-for-box-set programmes whose duration and frequency can be controlled by the viewer than as a last glorious flowering of the now-venerable serial form. To change the subject, I can't let this episode go by without mentioning one major exception to The Wire's attempts at social realism: Omar. In series five, Omar's character seems to take the programme on a strange, unexpected incursion into magical realism, with his death-defying \"Spider-Man\" leap from a balcony and the simple fact that he continues to carry on his street-by-street feud with Marlo \u2013 seemingly living on reputation alone \u2013 despite the critical impediment of a \"gimpy\" leg. But in truth Omar has always stood apart, with his flamboyant dialogue, his homosexuality, and his place outside both the criminal culture and the law. Early on, he assumes an untouchable, almost mythic stature: drugs fall to him without a shot being fired (as they do again this week), children play \"Omar\" instead of cops and robbers. To illustrate how far he moves beyond the grim naturalism of the archetypal Wire character, try to imagine him interacting remotely plausibly with anyone from the dock series. But all of this is undercut by the manner of his death, which seems a deliberate attempt by Simon and Burns to bring him down to earth, so to speak, to bring him back into the realm of the social realism that is the show's default setting. He is killed by a vicious child who has no real motive, and, what's more, the murder comes mid-episode: not for Omar the tense, wild-west stand-off afforded Stringer Bell or the urgent, tragic inevitability of Frank Sobotka's final rendezvous with the Greek. Omar's death is there to prove once and for all the cheapness of life in west Baltimore. It is there to warn of the nihilism and amorality of the next generation \u2013 \"Marlo's children\", we could call them. And most of all it is there to show what a meaningless, tiny event the existence of even such a charismatic, complex character as Omar is outside his own milieu: his murder is ignored by the city's most perceptive journalist and, in a moment of somewhat opaque symbolism, his ID tag is even pegged to the wrong body. No one outside Omar's own realm knows him, cares about him, or considers him to have been of the slightest importance whatsoever.
