Just as the weather rolled in off the Quantocks and Duckworth and Lewis warmed up, Usman Afzaal launched himself into Andy Caddick. Six balls - and 32 runs - later Somerset were heading for another rapid departure from the competition they had won in 2005. Caddick's previous two overs had gone for a respectable 12 runs, but when it mattered - with the first drops beginning to fall at the start of the fifth - the 38-year-old was lofted over the boundary four times and Afzaal added a couple of fours for good measure. It was brutal stuff. Lance Klusener took five boundaries off the following over from Gareth Andrews, Afzaal completed a 19-ball half century before being caught on the boundary, the heavens opened, and with seven overs of the Northants innings completed the complicated arithmetic of one-day cricket gave the visitors victory by 24 runs. All of which rather undermined an innings from Marcus Trescothick which would have pleased the England selectors were he not beyond their reach for the foreseeable future. The 32-year-old, currently enjoying his recuperation from the troubles that saw his departure from Australia in the winter, started quietly, content to watch Justin Langer and Cameron White set the pace,. White had softened up the bowling with a rapid 41 before Trescothick clipped Jason Brown out of the ground. The next ball faced, from Graeme White, bounced off the scorers's lofty perch behind the bowler's arm, followed by a drive into the St James graveyard which brought up the former England opener's 50. His fourth sixth was recovered from the crowd at extra-cover where it had shattered the window of the gents. Trescothick completed the over by driving White back over his head, which made 27 off the over. The first ball of the next was clattered over midwicket, the second rocketed into the crowd in front of the new pavilion, but then Trescothick found David Sales in the covers. His 35 balls were worth 76, but not nearly enough once Afzaal got going. Brown stars for Surrey Surrey secured their second successive Twenty20 Cup win, beating Hampshire by six wickets at The Oval in a game reduced to 10 overs a side following heavy rain. Surrey restricted the visitors to 72 for eight, with the spinners Nayan Doshi (three wickets for six runs) and Chris Schofield (two for 16) doing the damage. Alistair Brown then steered the home side to victory with 31 from 20 balls, despite being involved in two run outs. The first involved James Benning - who was left short of the crease after scoring 11 - and then Mark Ramprakash was beaten by a direct hit without facing a ball. Brown himself was then dismissed by a brilliant catch by Adam Voges and Rikki Clarke was the fourth man to fall, clean bowled for nine. An unbeaten 21 from Azhar Mahmood, though, saw Surrey home with seven balls to spare. The Sussex v Middlesex match was abandoned without a ball being bowled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
