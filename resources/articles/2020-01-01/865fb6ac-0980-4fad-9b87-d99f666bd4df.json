After six seasons and six trophies, including two FA Cup wins at Wembley and a Women\u2019s Super League title in 2016, he leaves for the men\u2019s MLS team New York City. Not, though, as manager but as No 2 to the newly appointed Norwegian Ronny Deila. Cushing\u2019s departure is not necessarily unexpected, but the timing of it is. There has been a feeling for a while that perhaps he is not the manager to help Manchester City prise the elusive Champions League trophy from Lyon. After consecutive semi-final defeats to the French champions in 2016-17 and 2017-18 City have suffered back-to-back losses to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, most recently in their last-16 tie in October. While City have stagnated in Europe, though stayed competitive domestically, Chelsea and Arsenal have leapfrogged them somewhat and look the more likely teams to upset Lyon\u2019s domination of Europe. Some wondered whether he might have departed last summer, on the high of a domestic cup double and solid title challenge after a trophyless year the preceding season. He is a highly respected manager. One that is known for an incredible attention to detail in the technical and tactical side of the game and a knack for nurturing young talent. The 22-year-old defensive midfielder Keira Walsh, whom Cushing described as the \u201cmost intelligent\u201d player he has ever worked with, recently told the Guardian of his impact. \u201cI just listen to what he says and try to do that on the pitch,\u201d she said. \u201cI see him getting criticism off fans and honestly it\u2019s the most baffling thing. I don\u2019t understand how he gets criticised because if you ask any player at this club they\u2019ll tell you what an unbelievable coach he is. \u201cHe\u2019s praised me but I just do what he tells me to do on the pitch and it works, it does for most of the girls. He tells us exactly where we should be in every moment and it\u2019s paid off in trophies. I wish other people would see what an unbelievable coach he is because he deserves more credit. \u201cIf you ask players who\u2019ve left they\u2019ll say that tactically he is head and shoulders above most coaches. He just loves football, he watches so much football and so many different teams that he just adapts us for every game. \u201cHopefully you can see it when we\u2019re playing. Playing back foot, on the floor, speed of pass, ball speed, that\u2019s what he\u2019s shouting on the sideline. He\u2019s just so detailed. \u201cI think he gets the best out of us, especially technical players. He\u2019s focused on the technical and tactical side so much that technical players do thrive under a coach like Nick.\u201d Walsh is one who has thrived, so much so her young age is often overlooked. \u201cI actually love Nick as a coach,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s always had my back throughout everything, since I was 17 years old. He\u2019s always trusted me to play and always put absolute faith in me to do a job for him.\u201d Her, Georgia Stanway and Lauren Hemp are a testament to Cushing\u2019s dedication to developing young English players. That is a legacy, perhaps, of the way in which Manchester City have nurtured him. His move to New York City, one of the many teams in the City Football Group fold, despite interest from National Women\u2019s Soccer League teams, keeps him under the business\u2019s wing. He started as a City schools coach then became part of the Manchester City academy coaching staff with the 12-16 development phase before being handed the reins of their revamped women\u2019s team. But moving mid-season is questionable. Yes, he does not leave until after City\u2019s league fixture against title rivals Arsenal on 2 February and it will enable him to take part in pre-season in New York, but he abandons the women\u2019s team when they are in a three-way fight for the championship with eight WSL games remaining \u2013 including league ties with Chelsea and Manchester United \u2013 and still involved in both domestic cup competitions. It is hard to imagine an almost four-week period with a departing manager in situ, and then a run of eight games with an interim boss in the current assistant, Alan Mahon, will not affect the team. It is seemingly a move driven by Cushing, who tweeted: \u201cI feel the time is now right to take the next step on my footballing journey and the project presented to me at @NYCFC is one that excites me and offers a great environment to progress my career at a great club. It is with a heavy heart I depart Manchester and I\u2019d like to thank the entire @ManCity team for the memories &amp; success we\u2019ve shared.\u201d Though it is hard not to feel that, as he leaves for a team within their circle, the City Football Group could have found a way to do more to limit the impact on the women\u2019s team. It is difficult to begrudge Cushing a move after what he has achieved and it is a loss to women\u2019s football that he departs for the men\u2019s game. But perhaps the apparent willingness to facilitate a move which looks to prioritise the development of the Eastern Conference champions, who reached the MLS play-off semi-finals, over their WSL project hints at where the women\u2019s team fits in the City Football Group empire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
