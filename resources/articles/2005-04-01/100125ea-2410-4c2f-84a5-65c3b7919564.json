Reassuring signs that spring had irrevocably arrived, after a few false starts. In the bottom of the hedgerow we found another, more sinister symbol of the season. After hazel's catkins wither, before its buds burst, sometimes something stirs in the soil around its roots. A hunched white shoot breaks through, uncurls and extends into a row of purple-tinged white flowers, like discoloured teeth. Toothwort is a parasite: no leaves, no green chlorophyll, just total dependence on its hazel host for nourishment. For most of the year it passes unnoticed as scaly, subterranean stems - rhizomes - welded to the hazel roots by suckers plugged into their internal plumbing system, siphoning off water and sugars. Then, in April, its flower spikes erupt through the soil, timed to catch the attention of newly emerging queen bee pollinators. Today there were scores of toothwort blooms among the hedgerow celandines, some already pollinated, with swelling seed capsules. Being leafless presents this plant with a problem. Leaves are more than just photosynthetic food factories. Water evaporates from their surface, pulling more water up from the roots, and out into the atmosphere. So how does leafless toothwort suck water and dissolved nutrients out of its host? Charles Darwin, ever curious, noticed that the soil was always wet for some distance around the flowers, even in dry weather. So he dug up its rhizomes, laid them on glass under a bell jar and watched glands on their scales exude a spreading pool of water."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
