It's often cited as Japan's leading orchestra, and on the basis of this Proms appearance on Monday, that seems a reasonable claim. There is no particularly distinctive character to their playing, but there is all the requisite technical command that a conductor could expect and, when the need arises, plenty of tonal power too - sometimes, where the brass is concerned, to the point of being overbearing. Those qualities, good and bad, were all set out in Shost-akovich's Fifth Symphony. There was no mistaking the scale of Dutoit's reading. It was grand, assertive, big-boned, with muscle in the climaxes and a high profile for the woodwind soloists in both the scherzo and the slow movement. But it was hard to determine what the performance was all about, and what the conductor sensed was at the core of this famously ambiguous work. For all the imposing solidity of the string tone in the opening bars, and the hushed transparency of the slow movement, there was an emotional void, which was merely reinforced by the athletic but basically just noisy finale. The first half had been far more interesting. In Takemitsu's Ceremonial, solos for the reedy harmonies of the Japanese sho (played by the outstanding Mayumi Miyata) frame a series of calls and responses between the orchestra and soloists dispersed around the auditorium. It made a perfectly calculated curtain-raiser for the main event, Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto, with Martha Argerich as soloist. The work has always been a staple of her small repertoire, and she has performed it in London before. But that familiarity in no way undermines the brilliance and volatility of her playing, in which every detail has a meaningful shape, every fistful of notes a perfectly honed purpose. Dutoit (Argerich's ex-husband) accompanied with intense concentration - well aware, perhaps, that anything could happen, but that it was bound to be electrifying. \u0095 This concert will be broadcast on Radio 3 on Monday.
