Gove dismissed as \u201cfoolish\u201d the idea that American authorities could ban a prime minister from entering their country, even though some UK citizens have been stopped from going to the US after admitting to having taken drugs. He acknowledged he was \u201cfortunate\u201d not to have been sent to prison for using the class-A drug while a journalist about 20 years ago but said it was unlikely to lead to a travel ban. Pressed on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show about whether he had ever lied about his drug use to US immigration authorities, Gove said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that I have ever, on any occasion, failed to tell the truth about this when asked directly.\u201d He said he was not asked about drug use when he became a government minister. The environment secretary has had to confront a series of difficult questions after his drug use while in his 30s was revealed in a new book by a journalist, Owen Bennett. Asked if he should have gone to prison, Gove said: \u201cI was fortunate in that I didn\u2019t, but I do think it was a profound mistake and I have seen the damage drugs do. I have seen it close up and I have also seen it in the work that I have done as a politician. That is why I deeply regret the mistake that I made.\u201d In the wake of the revelations, Sajid Javid, one of Gove\u2019s rivals for the leadership, hit out at middle-class users of class-A drugs who failed to think of the \u201ccountless lives destroyed\u201d by the trade. Javid, the home secretary, said he would not comment directly on Gove\u2019s admission but he said his view was that people taking class-A drugs needed to think about the abuse of young children trafficked into the trade. He also highlighted the hypocrisy of those who \u201chave their organic food, they boast about buying fair trade, they talk about climate change, and at the same time come Friday or Saturday night they\u2019re all doing drugs \u2013 and they should think about the impact they\u2019re having, especially on children with the rise in county gangs.\u201d Speaking on Sky\u2019s Ridge on Sunday programme, Javid said: \u201cAnyone that takes class-A drugs needs to think about that supply chain that comes, let\u2019s say, from Colombia to Chelsea, and the number of lives that are destroyed along the way. People should be thinking about the impact they\u2019re having on others.\u201d Gove admitted to the Daily Mail that he had taken cocaine when working as a journalist after he was confronted by revelations from Bennett\u2019s book. It is understood some of his former staff knew about the drug-taking from a meeting during his previous leadership bid. In a further embarrassment, the Observer reported that in 1999 Gove wrote an article in the Times setting out why he opposed what he called \u201cLondon\u2019s liberal consensus\u201d on loosening rules on the use of cocaine and other drugs. In the piece, headlined \u201cWhen it\u2019s right to be a hypocrite\u201d, he set out why he believed drug laws should not be repealed. With the drugs story overshadowing his campaign, Gove said in the Sunday Telegraph that if he became prime minister he would scrap VAT and replace it with \u201ca lower, simpler sales tax\u201d. He said he would also cut business rates. He said he would use \u201cthe money we get back from the EU\u201d to invest in \u201ctowns and communities which have suffered most from de-industrialisation\u201d, and introduce an Australian-style points-based immigration system \u201cto ensure the most innovative and gifted from across the globe can help us prosper\u201d. Gove\u2019s supporters have said they suspect the cocaine story was leaked by the camp of one of the other candidates as part of a \u201cdirty tricks\u201d operation. The episode led to other candidates being asked about whether they had used drugs. Dominic Raab, who has already admitted taking cannabis as a student, told the BBC: \u201cIt was a long time ago and pretty few and far between. I have never taken cocaine or any class-A drugs.\u201d Andrea Leadsom said in a statement: \u201cI have never taken cocaine or class-A drugs. Everyone is entitled to a private life before becoming an MP.\u201d Javid said he had never taken any drugs. Rory Stewart has said he smoked opium while travelling in Iran. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has said he once drank a cannabis lassi in India. Boris Johnson admitted in a GQ interview in 2007 he had tried cocaine and cannabis while at university, saying it \u201cachieved no pharmacological, psychotropic or any other effect on me whatsoever\u201d. He later changed his story, saying he was offered a \u201cwhite substance\u201d at university but none went up his nose because he sneezed. He said he had \u201cno idea whether it was cocaine or not\u201d and it could have been icing sugar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
