The rise has caused marine life changes, increases in microscopic animals and plants. The height of waves on the south-west coast has increased, and warm water fish and swarms of jellyfish have been observed. I have seen the latter on our local beaches. On one occasion, small discs of jellyfish less than 6cm in diameter were in a long line on Bishop's Quarter beach. Indeed, this year has seen strange, wonderful happenings, beginning with 11 breachings of a humpback whale off the Hook peninsula in County Wexford. In our June heatwave, the very rare female red-necked phalarope was sighted in the midlands, bringing crowds of watchers. The bird then disappeared, to the concern of Birdwatch Ireland. The female phalarope is quite a lady. She is more brilliantly coloured than the male, defends her territory, courts the male and, safely delivered of her eggs, disappears, leaving her mate to rear the young \u2013 she often goes on to form another alliance. Today we returned from our walk and began to examine the front garden. There, sitting beside the Cotoneaster horizontalis, was a pygmy shrew, Ireland's smallest mammal. Its eyesight is poor, so we had time to have a good look. I could see its teeth with their red deposit (from iron). They can climb and they fiercely defend their territories (under our cotoneaster!), which extend from 200 to more than 1,000 sq metres. They produce two to three broods each summer, the mothers dying before the winter. Their life span is exceedingly short. They hunt during the night and day, their expeditions lasting about two to three hours. To sustain life, they must eat their body weight daily."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
