At the IoD, where we believe wholeheartedly in the virtues of competition, we welcomed the news. But there is another area of our financial infrastructure that deserves some sunlight. I\u2019m referring to fund managers, and the alarming lack of transparency that surrounds their pay and practices. Just last week the FCA levelled an \u00a318m fine against Aviva for abusive fee practices. Aviva, one of the biggest players in the global fund management market, was found to have manipulated trades to boost its fees at the expense of customers. The practice had been going on for eight years and required Aviva to pay \u00a3132m in compensation to eight funds. There are many reasons to be proud of the fund management industry in the UK. But as New Financial, a European thinktank, pointed out recently, much more clarity is required about how they operate and, most pertinent of all, how their salaries are earned. Average compensation cost per employee at global asset managers rose 22% between 2006 and 2014 to an estimated $263,000 (\u00a3170,000). It was reported last week that two top managers at Standard Life will each receive pay in excess of \u00a35m. If fund manager earnings continue to rise in line with assets, with little or no transparency about how they operate, then their reputations as prudent custodians of other people\u2019s money could start to unravel. The way in which large fund managers operate is understood only by a few. An FCA investigation into their fees, voting record and whether they are good stewards who operate with a long term focus, is desperately needed. While pay at investment banks is taking up a \u201cshrinking portion of a shrinking pot,\u201d to quote New Financial, pay at asset management firms is taking a constant portion of a \u201cgrowing pot.\u201d This has all the ingredients of another scandal, where public attention turns slowly to a shady quarter of our financial landscape, and doesn\u2019t like what it sees. Until we really understand the mechanisms of this industry the risk remains that fund managers will become the new investment bankers. As the general election approaches, we must remember that anti-business sentiment is rife and the financial services industry remains a by-word for greed and impunity. Some of this is warranted, and reflects a regulatory fascination with banks. My concern is that, although we have a more pressing area to focus on in the form of the fund management industry, regulators seem to be behind the curve. Indeed, they seem uninterested in the sector. It is important for the entire UK business community that fund managers are effective overseers of good governance, rather than mere absentee landlords. Unless that happens, policymakers will inevitably lose faith in the ability of shareholders to act as custodians of public companies. They will be drawn to the temptation of legislating and regulating to shape directly corporate governance arrangements in the UK. If the fund management industry doesn\u2019t take steps to address growing public concern about their practices and oversight, then an FCA-driven approach may be the only way forward. The challenge for any regulator is to operate both fairly and impartially across the entire sector. Investment banks and City bonuses have served as the lighting rod that protects fund managers from similar scrutiny and opprobrium. In the interests of understanding more about this industry, and in order to avoid another scandal of epic proportions the FCA should act now. Labour\u2019s recent proposals to compel fund managers to reveal their voting records would be a good place to start. After all, what have they got to hide?
