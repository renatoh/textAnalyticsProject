That may be right. The only trouble is these days it's very hard to tell if football is really dying, or just clutching its throat and making gagging noises in order to disrupt the rhythm of its competitors. Rugby union, meanwhile, has fallen victim to what everybody connected with the sport is calling \"The Bloodgate Scandal\". Frankly I'm disappointed that followers of the oval ball game have chosen to draw on a shabby piece of US political impropriety for their suffix to the Tom Williams business. I would have thought a club of Harlequins' tradition and standing might have adopted something more noble and blue-bloodedly British, christening the whole gory debacle \"The Bloodfumo Affair\", perhaps. Former coach Dick Best tells us that the use of blood capsules in the Premiership is common nowadays. \"I believe they are the sort you'd find on the set of any film with stunt scenes,\" he said last week. If this is indeed the case then we can only hope that in future rugby union will bring in some proper advisers on the use of the stuff, because I'd have to say Dean Richards and his men didn't make the most of what they had, Williams sloping off the field looking like a toddler who'd just had a raspberry slushy when they could have given us something like the final shoot-out in Bonnie and Clyde. I'm sure if that fanatic for detail Sir Clive Woodward had been in charge it would have been a different matter. Sir Clive is a man who has never shied away from assembling a backroom staff so large that often his backroom is bigger than the actual stadium. I'm sure he'd have recognised the importance of getting in a specialist to coach the players in blood capsule usage, somebody like Hollywood movie brute Brian De Palma, perhaps, or King of the Living Dead George A Romero. Then we'd have watched in awe as Williams went down in a series of slow motion, jerking spasms, his jaw flapping loosely as he yelled out \"Mmmmawwwthorrrrfokkkkkkah\" in a weirdly deep voice. As Jim Smith once remarked about Robbie Savage: \"We've all seen players who are clever at getting penalties, but he's not even clever.\" I'm with the Bald Eagle on that. If you're going to cheat at least show us a bit of craft. If rugby players are going to continue faking bloody wounds they should make their own sound effects as well. There's a distinct possibility, of course, that modern sportsmen don't know how to do such a thing. At one time that wouldn't have been a problem. Because during the 1960s and 1970s British youngsters spent almost as much time refighting the second world war as they did playing sport. In the context of gamesmanship, play acting and faking serious wounds one pastime was particularly helpful \u2013 Best Man Dead. For those of you unfamiliar with it I should explain that Best Man Dead was a splendidly simple game that placed emphasis on the absolute importance of dying in as spectacular a manner as possible to entertain your friends. The players lined up along the wall by the boys' toilets and, when called by the final arbiter of all things (The Big Tough Boy Whose Brother Is In Borstal), each shouted out the weapon by which he was about to be cut down and then enacted the appropriate death scene. The most popular choices were: Submachine gun. The player was hit by bursts of automatic fire causing him to leap and twitch across the playground before gripping the litter bin post and sliding down it gradually with his tongue hanging out. Extra marks were awarded for quality of submachine gun noise with special attention given to the ability to suggest some differences between the trusty old Thompson SMG and Gerry's infernal Schmeisser. Hand grenade. The player watched in horror as a hand grenade came bouncing towards him, rushed valiantly towards it in the hope of throwing it back towards the enemy, but alas \u2026 The explosion caused him to jump high in the air and land in a crumpled heap. His last act, pointing towards the enemy and croaking, \"You'll never beat us, Fritz.\" Ambushed in the jungle by millions of Japanese soldiers. Player cut his way through thick foliage using a machete without realising that a cunning enemy surrounded him. Suddenly shots rang out on all sides causing him to stumble, knocking over the dustbins by the science lab and bouncing off Mrs Grimble the dinner lady, before finally coming to rest in the entrance to the temporary classroom. As the lights dimmed he raised his head and called out, \"Leave me here, lads. I'll only hold you up,\" causing several witnesses to sob manfully into their hankies. After all contestants had enacted their death scene The Big Tough Boy Whose Brother Is In Borstal chose the winner. His decision was based on artistic merit, dramatic effect and which player did his maths homework for him last. To be honest, I'm not sure if such activities were entirely healthy, but one thing is for certain \u2013 if Richards had made Best Man Dead part of regular training at The Stoop, Harlequins might well have avoided all this bother."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
