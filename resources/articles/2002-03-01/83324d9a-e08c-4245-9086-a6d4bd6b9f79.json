The game was notable in only one respect: to confirm, as if it were necessary, that the Premier League championship is heading for Parkhead. As the Rangers players trudged off for the sanctuary of the dressing-room, the antics of Celtic's manager and players was ample illustration that they too understood the significance of this draw. It is almost unthinkable that Celtic's 10-point lead, with a game in hand and only seven remaining, will be caught. Even the Rangers manager Alex McLeish appeared resigned and said: \"I don't see Celtic being beaten by too many teams. \"We came back well in the second half and I was pleased with the belief, commitment and bravery we showed, which was epitomised by Barry Ferguson, who went through the pain barrier for us with his rib injury.\" That was not enough, however, and although both McLeish and Ferguson knew the team were drinking in the last chance saloon yesterday, the performance of other players did not suggest they shared that view. Rangers, in the first half especially, lacked the expected urgency and thus handed the initiative to Celtic, who gratefully accepted it with a Stilian Petrov goal after 22 minutes when the Bulgarian pounced on a pass from Henrik Larsson to leave Stefan Klos helpless. Yet Rangers might well have been a goal in arrears before that when John Hartson forced the ball home, again from a Larsson pass, after 13 minutes, and although it was ruled out for offside, television replays suggested it should have counted. The home team were more Glasgow Strangers as they deployed Neil McCann in an unusual role in support of Tore Andre Flo and the frustration proved too much for Ferguson, who was booked for persistent fouling five minutes after his team had gone behind. The Rangers captain did, however, re-establish a measure of calm and dictated play after the interval when, with Shota Arveladze brought on for the ineffective Claudio Caniggia, the home side at last upped the pace. Arthur Numan's ferocious strike that sped past Robert Douglas after 58 minutes signalled something of an onslaught thereafter. Peter Lovenkrands shot over the bar, Douglas twice saved well from Ferguson and Arveladze had a header held by the goalkeeper. Yet Celtic, who had pushed on Jackie McNamara for Steve Guppy after 75 minutes, remained a threat and Klos, with a little help from Lorenzo Amoruso, thwarted Hartson while the goalkeeper relied on his own agility to touch over a fierce effort from Didier Agathe. Given the importance of the fixture it was something of a mystery as to why the game remained so low-key. In the end a draw was about right. \"We are now in a very strong position,\" said O'Neill. \"Now we have to win our game in hand and see it all through. But to say it is already won is one thing I would disagree with, definitely.\" While Celtic set about mopping up the title, Rangers are left with the CIS Insurance Cup final against Ayr United to look forward to next weekend and then, perhaps, one last Old Firm clash in the Scottish Cup final following the remaining, and quite possibly painful, league meeting at Parkhead.
