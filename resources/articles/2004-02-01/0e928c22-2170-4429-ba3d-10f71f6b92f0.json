Jones' place on the tour was confirmed only yesterday, and the Welshman is due to fly back to the UK tomorrow from the England A tour in India before joining the full Test team in the Caribbean. England hope he will be able to link up against the West Indies with the likes of Steve Harmison as part of a formidable if still inexperienced pace attack. But Vaughan, speaking at a Gatwick press conference as his team prepare to fly out tomorrow, is anxious no-one expects too much too soon from either Jones or Harmison. Jones was forced out of first-class cricket for more than a year after rupturing the cruciate ligaments in his right knee in the first Ashes Test in Brisbane in November 2002. He returned to serious action with England A only this month, and Vaughan accepts he does not yet know what shape the Glamorgan bowler will be in when he joins his team-mates. \"We have to be realistic. Steve Harmison missed out in Sri Lanka through injury, and Simon has not played international cricket for a long period and has only ever played one (full) Test match,\" said Vaughan. \"He has come back well and proved his fitness in India. But we need to give him a little bit of time to adjust to international cricket once again and let him settle in.\" Vaughan is nonetheless convinced England have an outstanding opportunity to push for a first series victory on Caribbean soil since 1968. \"We have a fantastic chance of going out there and doing very well,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
