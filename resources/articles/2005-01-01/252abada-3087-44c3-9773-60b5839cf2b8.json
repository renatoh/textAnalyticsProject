As the Indonesian death toll from the tsunami was given as at least 173,000, moves towards solving the longstanding insurgency progressed under the auspices of the former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari's Crisis Management Initiative. Last week the Indonesian foreign minister, Hasan Wirayuda, promised new talks before the month's end, and President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's office said the president had hoped for a new peace initiative even before the tsunami struck on December 26. The response of the Free Aceh Movement (Gam) has been more equivocal. A military spokesman told the Guardian by phone that he assumed that Thursday's meeting would be \"preparatory\". He added: \"The time is always good [for peace talks]. But the question is: what is the intention of the Indonesian government? We don't know why they want talks now. Why not before? Why not stop the military offensive? They only talk peace after we lost nearly 200,000 people in the tsunami.\" About 2,000 bodies are still being recovered every day, almost a month after the tsunami hit. Aid officials say that several hundred thousand people are still without adequate food, shelter and security. The armed forces commander, Endriatono Sutarto, says his forces have stopped making attacks. But the hardline army chief of staff, Ryamizard Ryacudu, insists that his troops have to defend themselves and aid convoys from attacks, and this has resulted in them killing 208 rebels. Gam said it had lost 23 fighters since the tsunami, and the others killed were civilians. \"The government says it is doing no operations, but it doesn't feel like that. The armed forces do business as usual, they have no shame. It is just their normal game,\" the source said. He suggested that peace talks could be fruitful only if there were no pre-conditions. If Jakarta insisted on Gam laying down its weapons or accepting its claim to Aceh, the talks would not progress. The last attempt to end 30 years of fighting fell apart in May 2003 when the army began a brutal new offensive. Aceh was put under martial law and closed to outside observers. Opinion is divided on whether peace prospects are any better than before. Observers say the combatants have shown little sign of moving from their positions, despite both sides declaring a ceasefire after the tsunami. \"There is so much anger still, the old anger about the military is still very much alive,\" the Australian academic Edward Aspinall said in Banda Aceh. Any mismanagement of the relief effort will deepen the Acehnese sense of grievance. Regardless of what is said in Finland, people in Aceh are watching levels of compensation, how refugees are relocated, what rights to land are respected, what housing is offered to whom, and whether Acehnese people are being consulted about any of it. Nevertheless, some analysts feel the tsunami may have offered the best chance of peace. \"Empathy for the Acehnese after the tsunami is real, throughout the country, which helps foster a sense of belonging,\" Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a former foreign policy adviser to government, said. \"It is not in the best interests of this government to pursue civil war for the benefit of the military. We must give this government the benefit of the doubt.\" She added: \"I am cautiously hopeful. Peace won't break out overnight, as confidence building will take time. But I hope peace-building will be part of the reconstruction process.\" \u00b7 The Maldives government promised to speed up democratic reforms yesterday after initial indications from parliamentary elections showed that the opposition Maldives Democratic party had won both seats in the capital, Male."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
