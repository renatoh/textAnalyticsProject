There are so many that it becomes easy to lose track of what they mean. Take for example his record of 36 consecutive grand slam quarter-finals. The only player who had any hope of matching it was Novak Djokovic. He gave it a damn good try, making it to 28, before coming unstuck at Wimbledon last year. That left him only two years short. How absurd is 36 in a row? Were Grigor Dimitrov, who after his run to the semi-finals looks set to make the next step, to start a streak from this tournament, all he would need to do to break the record is to make the quarter-final of every grand slam tournament from this year\u2019s French Open until the Australian Open in 2026. But of course the biggest numbers that hover over Federer are those of age and time. Age and time have been the story of this year\u2019s tournament \u2013 where the past has come back in a manner so unexpected it was akin to tuning into Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100 and hearing U2 and Powderfinger in the top 2. On the women\u2019s side, the Williams sisters reached the final. Serena was not a shock \u2013 for so long now she has been the prohibitive favourite in any event she turns up to. But Venus? She hadn\u2019t made the final of the Australian Open since 2003 \u2013 when Serena won her fifth grand slam title and fourth in a row. How long ago was that? No other women seeded that year were even in the women\u2019s draw this year. The year 2003 was so long ago that it was when a young Sam Stosur was given a wild card and teenagers Maria Sharapova and Jelena Jankovic made it through qualifying to play their first grand slam tournament. So long ago was 2003, that Federer was still yet to win a grand slam title. Let it be said that Federer might be the greatest male player of all time, but for supreme longevity he still has ways to go till he catches Serena and Venus. Federer would win his first Australian Open the following year \u2013 it was the tournament that took him to No 1 in the world for the first time. And he stayed in that spot for four and a half years \u2013 a year and a half longer than the next best consecutive run of 160 weeks by Jimmy Connors. And, much like with the Williamses, he finds himself virtually alone among his generation. Only Feliciano Lopez remains in the game of those seeded in 2004. So long ago was 2004, that Federer would miss out on playing Rafael Nadal for the first time because Lleyton Hewitt beat Nadal in the third round in straight sets, before then losing to Federer in the fourth round. But for me the best number to measure the passing of time, the age, and the utter absurdity of Federer, is to realise the age difference between Federer and those whom we consider his contemporaries. When Nadal met Dimitrov in the semi-final on Friday night, it was a match between the old and young \u2013 a match between players from different eras \u2013 Nadal a man who won his first French Open when Kevin Rudd was still just a shadow foreign minister, and Dimitrov, who played his first in 2011 \u2013 a year after Federer won his last Australian Open, and two years after Nadal did. And yet the age difference between the 30-year-old Nadal and the 25-year-old Dimitrov is only two months greater than the difference between Nadal and the 35-year-old Federer. Federer is like the baby boomer of tennis \u2013 that generation that seems to hang around forever, unwilling to relinquish power. But those of his generation did relinquish their power long ago. His three true peers were Hewitt, Marat Safin and Andy Roddick \u2013 the three men Federer beat in 2004 to win his three grand slam titles. Safin and Hewitt\u2019s last appearance in a grand slam final was the 2005 Australian Open; Roddick\u2019s last was the 2009 Wimbledon, where Federer beat him 16-14 in the fifth set. In their place came Nadal, then Djokovic and Andy Murray. And so long has Federer stuck around, and so young were Nadal and Djokovic when they reached the top, that we now see Federer as more of an era which to be honest, he barely belongs. So long has he been around, that Federer fans are able to point to three years of excitement as the old guy made a run towards an improbable 18th slam title \u2013Wimbledon in 2014 and 2015, the 2015 US Open, and even last year\u2019s Australian Open, where each time Djokovic stepped up to deny him the fairytale ending. But this year was different. After missing six months because of injury, no one gave him much chance. Tomas Berdych in the third round was a big ask. Yet Federer played one of those matches that rendered his opponent a mere spectator. Kei Nishikori in the fourth round should have been too difficult for the old legs to surpass, and yet he beat the player, eight years his junior in five sets. after which he demolished Mischa Zverev, the conqueror of Andy Murray, with little ado. But Stan Wawrinka in the semi was of course going to be too big, too strong. And then Federer with supreme tennis took the first two sets and around the world tennis fans and TV executives began to believe. The bells of the Church of Federer were ringing, and the parishioners were filling into the pews ready to shout hallelujah! Then Wawrinka won seven games in a row, took the third and then at 4-4 in the fourth set, Federer played a horrible service game, was broken and just like that it was all square. As Don Maclean might say, the church bells all were broken. But have faith ye doubters. Federer withstood a break point in the third game of the fifth set and Stan gifted him a break with a double fault in the sixth game. And it was won. Preach to the choir! Testify to the miracle! Meanwhile, over on the other side of the draw, Nadal was performing his own improbable run. Surely he too was past it \u2013 he hadn\u2019t even made a slam semi-final for two and a half years and his body seemed broken by the years on the court. Nadal, whose game bludgeons opponents with relentless spin and power, seemed to be the final victim to that power. Unlike Federer, whose game is so flui that the only way he was able to injure his knee was while giving his young daughters a bath, Nadal\u2019s game is so based around effort that he become the closest a tennis player will be to a boxer \u2013 sweat dripping down his face, anguished grunts with every shot, his biceps flexed ready to punch another forehand. Nadal looked gone in the third round, and yet came back from two sets to one down to beat the best of generation next, Alexander Zverev. In the quarter finals, he dealt with Milos Raonic like a master dealing with an apprentice \u2013 and yet again, Nadal is closer in age to Raonic than he is to Federer. The semi-final against Dimitrov was vintage Nadal. Federer might have caused a generation of tennis fans to lose sleep staying up watching him play in different time zones, but Nadal does it here in Australia, as yet again he played another five-set match that went well past midnight. And so the match everyone wanted is here \u2013 a return to the past \u2013 and yet because it is sport, this is not some band doing a greatest hits tour. This fortnight, Federer and Nadal are the two best men tennis players in the world. They have each released a new album and it sounds as fresh as their earlier stuff. And yet the music is different now. We will no longer gasp as we once did. Gone mostly are the shots that wreck the brain of a tennis fan. Gone is the reflex to wonder \u201cdid I just see that?\u201d Gone is the realisation that the laws of physics that once governed tennis have been re-written. Federer still has that \u201cgreat liquid whip\u201d forehand that led to David Foster Wallace measuring the Swiss legend\u2019s performances against those of a god, but he has been doing it for so long now that players such as Nadal, Djokovic and Murray have not only come along to counter it, they have also been able to pass their secret along to a new generation. It seems barely plausible that when Wallace beatified Federer\u2019s forehand, Grigor Dimitrov was a 15-year-old, still two years away from winning the junior Wimbledon and US Open titles and Nadal was just a great clay court player with only two French Open titles to his name. On Sunday night, the two greats meet for the 35th time \u2013 and in all likelihood for the last time in a grand slam final \u2013 something they haven\u2019t done since 2011, and haven\u2019t done here for seven years. As ever, when the two meet, Nadal should be favourite. Federer might be the god of tennis, but Nadal is the Prometheus, who stole Federer\u2019s fire and lit the way for Djokovic and Murray to follow. In the past when Nadal and Federer played, you saw shots you never expected to see; now we see two players in a position we never expected to see again. As ever, the numbers in the match will be amazing \u2013 31 grand slam titles on both sides of the net. But as ever, context is the key. This is not just seeing two greats battle for the title. This is the last chance to see it. The last chance to see the two greatest being great at the same time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
