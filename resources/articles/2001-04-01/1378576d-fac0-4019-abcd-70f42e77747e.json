Leaving the shell on, butterfly the prawns by slicing them with a sharp knife, cutting from back to legs, so that they lie flat, shell-side down, and the two halves approximate the shape of a heart. Wash and gut them under cold water. Salt and pepper the prawns liberally. In a skillet over medium heat, brown the garlic. Arrange the prawns in the pan, shell-side down, and saut\u00e9 for about four minutes, or until most of the body has become opaque. Turn the heat to high. When the skillet begins to sizzle, add the rum and orange juice mixture and immediately slam a tight cover on the skillet, pressing down firmly so that very little steam can escape. Keep the cover pressed down for about 3 minutes. Remove from heat, and uncover. The prawns should look fat, blackened and engorged. Serve from the pan, shell-side down, covering the prawns with the remaining rum sauce."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
