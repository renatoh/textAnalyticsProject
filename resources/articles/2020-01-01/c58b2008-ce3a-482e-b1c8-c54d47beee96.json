Silva, who is 34, joined in June 2010 and is viewed by many supporters as City\u2019s greatest ever player and Guardiola views the 19-year-old Foden, who has already made more than 50 appearances, as Silva\u2019s natural heir. \u201cPhil is an incredible player but he still has things to improve,\u201d said the City manager, as he prepared for Sunday\u2019s game at Aston Villa. \u201cSometimes it takes time to understand exactly what he has to do. Sometimes you have to be patient. But David is going to leave this season [and] we are not going to buy any player in his position because we have Phil. \u201cMaybe this season Phil will have more minutes, or maybe less, I don\u2019t know. We trust Phil. If we didn\u2019t believe in him we might go to the market to replace David, but we have Phil. He is the guy who is going to take his [Silva\u2019s] minutes or maybe he has to fight with Kevin [De Bruyne], Gundo [Ilkay G\u00fcndogan] and Bernardo [Silva]. It\u2019s the only way to maintain the level as high as possible [this competition]. \u201cThe way Phil has played has been incredible. I think he has played well and [had] enough minutes, but if we have many, many injuries in that position he will play more minutes [this season], we know that.\u201d Guardiola, though, is unsure if Taylor Harwood-Bellis, who is 17, Mike Doyle (18) and Eric Garc\u00eda (19) can join Foden to form a nucleus of home-grown players in a future City team that can be as successful as Manchester United\u2019s class of \u201992. \u201cI would like to answer by saying yes, but I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is hard to say what young players will do in the future. But obviously they are Man City fans. Hopefully they will do it because it is good when the players have a relationship like that with the club. But they are young \u2013 and we have to wait.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
