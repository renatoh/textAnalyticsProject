Stewart is equally vilified and celebrated in the US for his straight-talking commentary on the state of the nation. There's no subject he won't tackle, spreading bare the gaping holes between rhetoric and political reality. Stewart's handling of the congressional hearings into videogame violence set out to lampoon the greyhairs in charge of the nation. In doing so, he exposed the ignorance that saturates elected officialdom. The Republican representative from Michigan admitted to being a gamer, having been an \"expert\" at Pong. Another allied himself with Civilisation IV, but was unable to construct a grammatically correct argument. Offering greatest insight, however, was Nebraska's Republican representative, Lee Terry, who was concerned about the content of the games played by his children, aged six, eight and 11. As far as I could glean, he stands and watches them while they play. The show's point was to make buffoons of the out-of-touch representatives responsible for the games industry. Here's the thing, people: if gaming goes down in the US, we'll feel the waves in the UK. We are as much subject to the whims of those officials as our own when it comes to legislating the sale of media. The reason? It's not just gamers watching the proceedings with bated breath; mega-corporations are also taking note of what content is within and, importantly, in polar opposition to the moral remit of America. Why does this matter to us? UK-based developers and publishers have long been under the thumbs of US capitalist palaces of consumption. America is where the big bucks are, and for a game to be considered a success it needs to chart there. Sony, Microsoft, EA and Nintendo may have nominal control over interactive entertainment trends, but supermarkets sell one-third of the launch sales of videogames. Innovation has already been a casualty of the supermarketisation of gaming, resulting in sequel saturation; legislation in the US will be another excuse to moralise output. I'm extrapolating profoundly here. We don't know what Congress is even arguing for. Politicians are simply looking for answers to a raft of questions. But more serious and depressing is the bandwagon-jumping. As Stewart explained to a crowd of whooping fraternity boys, \"violent videogames [are] the latest target of Washington's election year ire\". The last thing the industry needs is the kneejerking that accompanies the development of political agendas. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
