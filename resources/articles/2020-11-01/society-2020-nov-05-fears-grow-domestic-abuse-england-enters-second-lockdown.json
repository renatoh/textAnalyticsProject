The impact of the pandemic on those facing domestic abuse was evident almost immediately during the national lockdown in March. The Counting Dead Women project told MPs that between 23 March and 12 April, at least 16 domestic abuse killings had taken place \u2013 much higher than the average for the time of year - while calls to the National Domestic Abuse Helpline were running at 49% higher than normal three weeks after lockdown was introduced. A recent survey of survivors and services by the charity SafeLives found that 61% of survivors were unable to reach out for support during lockdowns \u201cpartly because they weren\u2019t able to access phone or online support, or their perpetrator was with them all the time\u201d. In August, the charity released data showing that even with these continuing difficulties, 38% of services reported increases in demand during the previous month. Sarah Davidge, research and evaluation manager at Women\u2019s Aid, says that people were facing extended time with their abusers at home while valuable lifelines are cut off, including to friends and family. And walk-in centres shuttering \u2013 as local services shifted from in-person to telephone or online support \u2013 have created additional barriers. \u201cIf you think about the women who don\u2019t even have access to phones or the internet, speak another language, or they\u2019re being prevented from access by their abuser, then we\u2019re really just scratching the surface.\u201d In Wales, where a 17-day \u201cfirebreak\u201d lockdown came into operation on 23 October, fresh concerns have been raised about the impact on those facing domestic abuse. \u201cOur immediate fear with regards to the firebreak lockdown is that survivors will be isolated from their normal support system and will not be aware of the support that is available for them,\u201d says a Welsh Women\u2019s Aid spokeswoman. Frontline organisations throughout the UK, including smaller specialist services catering for women from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, and refugees and asylum seekers are under greater strain too. The government\u2019s initial response to the pandemic was a funding injection of \u00a32m early on but this was criticised as vastly insufficient. In many way,s Covid-19 has thrown into sharp focus numerous issues surrounding the protection of people facing domestic abuse that long predate the pandemic. During a decade of austerity the sector has suffered drastic funding cuts, including \u00a37m slashed by councils for women\u2019s refuges in England, Wales and Scotland between 2010 and 2018. The 2020 Domestic Abuse Report from Women\u2019s Aid estimated that more than 23,000 referrals to refuges were declined in 2018-19. Meanwhile, domestic violence-related murders reached a five-year high in the UK in 2018, according to data compiled from 43 police forces. In addition, falls in prosecutions of perpetrators have set off alarm bells, with trial delays and other problems with the justice system, including cuts to legal aid, heightening concerns around access to justice for victims. In London alone, reports of rape and sexual offences increased by 25% between 2015 and 2020, but convictions dropped by almost a quarter, and the time it takes to bring charges of rape almost tripled. One glimmer of light is the long-awaited domestic abuse bill, due to become law in early 2021. Framed as a \u201clandmark\u201d piece of legislation by the government, it will usher in significant reforms in England and Wales. Among the new measures is the recognition for the first time of children as victims, a ban on \u201cconsenting\u201d to rough sex being used as a defence in murder cases, and an acknowledgment of economic abuse in the statutory definition. The inclusion of a statutory duty on councils in England to provide support for victims in refuges and \u201cother safe accommodation\u201d has been welcomed, along with the statutory appointment of a domestic abuse commissioner. Nevertheless, many in the sector are warning that as it stands, the law is far from a panacea. Despite the government giving English councils a further \u00a36m to help them prepare for their new legal duties to provide domestic abuse services, concerns remain about funding shortfalls. Ellie Butt, head of policy and public affairs at Refuge, said that \u201cas a matter of urgency, the government needs to commit to providing at least \u00a3174m per year so that councils can commission the refuge accommodation that women and children fleeing domestic abuse so desperately need.\u201d Women\u2019s Aid estimates that to fund the sector in England and meet demand across services requires \u00a3393m annually. There is also widespread frustration that despite concerted efforts the law will not guarantee protection for migrant women who, because of their uncertain immigration status, have no recourse to public funds, leaving them unable to access statutory support. Elizabeth Jim\u00e9nez-Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, coordinator at the Step Up Migrant Women Campaign, says: \u201cEven before the pandemic, four out of five women with no recourse to public funds were turned away by refuge accommodation\u201d. A Home Office spokesman said ministers realised the pandemic had \u201ccreated new challenges for victims of domestic abuse\u201d, pointing to the \u201cpackage of support\u201d made available in response, including \u00a32m for helplines and online services and \u201c\u00a376m for charities supporting survivors of domestic abuse, sexual violence and modern slavery, as well as vulnerable children\u201d, as well as its public awareness campaign, #YouAreNotAlone. On the bill, he said. \u201cThis is a truly game-changing piece of legislation and will transform our response to victims in every region in England and Wales and ensure perpetrators are brought to justice.\u201d But most people working in the sector don\u2019t feel it goes far enough. As Sophie Francis-Cansfield, senior campaigns and policy officer at Women\u2019s Aid, says: \u201cIt would be really tough to argue \u2018job done\u2019 once this bill passes because there is so much more to address. There is so much more to a survivor\u2019s needs than what is currently within this bill.\u201d While the sector awaits confirmation of the domestic violence bill\u2019s second reading in the Lords, the issue of adequate funding for services looms large. In Wales, now into the second week of its firebreak, Welsh Women\u2019s Aid says: \u201cWe know that the abuse survivors face during this lockdown and the wider Covid-19 pandemic will have lasting impacts and we need reassurance that services will be sustainably funded and resourced beyond March 2021.\u201d The Welsh deputy minister and chief whip, Jane Hutt, who was the first national coordinator for Women\u2019s Aid in Wales, says ministers are \u201cworking hard to make sure that victims know what support is available to them\u201d. But she adds: \u201cI fear that victims will think that this firebreak period means they have to stay at home and suffer when abuse is happening. That is not the case at all.\u201d In England, similar fears are being expressed. \u201cWe are concerned that another national lockdown will again make it harder for survivors to escape to safety,\u201d says Francis-Cransfield. \u201cWe continue to urge for a long-term sustainable funding solution for the violence against women and girls\u2019 sector if it is to survive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
