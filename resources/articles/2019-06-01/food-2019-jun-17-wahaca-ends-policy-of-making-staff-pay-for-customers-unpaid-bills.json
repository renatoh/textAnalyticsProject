The former Labour leader of Camden council Sarah Hayward contacted the company on social media on Saturday 15 June after hearing of the policy, saying: \u201cHi @wahaca just eaten in your Kentish Town restaurant for the last time. Ppl next to us left without paying and their server is made to foot the bill from his wages. Apparently company policy. Utterly shameful employment practice.\u201d The post has been retweeted more than 8,000 times, and the waiter has been assured he will not have to cover the costs of the bill. Wahaca said the incident was caused by an \u201cinternal communications issue\u201d and that it had demonstrated the need for \u201cclarity over the policy\u201d. The new policy will ensure that a waiter is not financially responsible for a bill if a customer walks out, but will be investigated if there is reason to suspect the waiter was complicit in the walkout. The company said: \u201cIn light of the recent incident where customers walked out of one of our restaurants without paying, we realise that our policy on how to deal with this has not been clear enough and we apologise to our teams for this. \u201cWe subsequently contacted all of our teams to clarify this and to ensure that waiters will not have to pay in the unfortunate times when this occurs. \u201cIn situations of a walkout, whilst the waiter is responsible for the table they will not have to pay any element of the bill. However, if the manager suspects that the waiter was complicit in the walkout then there should be a full investigation which will be taken to the operations manager to decide the appropriate action.\u201d In a separate statement, Mark Selby, the owner of Wahaca, said: \u201cIn no way would an individual be responsible for covering the bill in a situation they had no control over. As a business, we prioritise our staff and do everything we can to ensure our teams are well looked after at work.\u201d Previously, company policy dictated that individuals should only be responsible for an unpaid bill in cases where \u201creal negligence\u201d had occurred \u2013 for example allowing a customer to leave knowing that they had not paid. A spokesperson from Unite the Union said that while the policy was shocking, it seemed to be standard industry practice. \u201cThis sort of behaviour is wage theft and it is just the tip of the iceberg because companies will say it is just the actions of individual managers, but those managers are given leeway to behave that way. But a manager only thinks they can do that because they think they\u2019re following policy. \u201cIt is wrong, it is bad practice and it has got to stop,\u201d she said. She also warned that in cases where deductions come from low-wage staff members, the policy could also be in breach of the Minimum Wage Act."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
