The law is to be changed so disqualified drivers could face the sentence if they caused a death, and up to four years' imprisonment if they caused serious injuries. These tougher maximum sentences are designed to reflect the impact on victims and their families, Grayling said. The current maximum sentence facing a driver who causes death while driving when disqualified is two years' imprisonment and there is no specific offence of causing serious injury by driving while disqualified. The government plans to change the law shortly to introduce the new sentences. The changes are expected to be implemented early next year. A new review of driving offences is to be carried out over the next few months and published in due course. The change follows a campaign by the families of victims of disqualified drivers, backed by the Tory backbenchers Chris Skidmore and Steve Barclay. They pointed to the example of Graham Godwin, 36, who had been drinking and smoking cannabis, was speeding and had allowed his girlfriend to ride pillion when he crashed and killed pedestrian Paul Stock. He was jailed for 18 months for causing his death because prosecutors said there was not enough evidence for a charge of causing death by dangerous driving. Godwin, who had a long criminal record including 45 previous traffic offences, pleaded guilty to driving while disqualified and without insurance, and growing cannabis in his home. Stock's widow Mandy met with David Cameron and Grayling last year. Barclay uncovered figures which show that in 2011, 153 of the 408 people convicted of causing death or bodily harm while driving dangerously, or under the influence of drink or drugs, avoided jail altogether. Five were given fines, and 63 were given suspended prison sentences. Last year, husband and wife Ross and Clare Simons were on a tandem bicycle when they were hit by a Citroen Picasso in Hanham, near Bristol. Nicky Lovell, 38, who had 11 previous convictions for driving while disqualified, was being pursued by police at the time of the accident. He pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and one of driving while disqualified and was jailed for 10 years and six months \u2013 the maximum sentence possible. Grayling also announced his intention to launch a full review of all driving offences and penalties, to ensure people who endangered lives and public safety were properly punished. This would include reviewing offences committed by uninsured and unlicensed drivers. He said: \"I want to make our roads safer and ensure people who cause harm face tough penalties. Disqualified drivers should not be on our roads for good reason. Those who chose to defy a ban imposed by a court and go on to destroy innocent lives must face serious consequences for the terrible impact of their actions. \"Today, we are sending a clear message that anyone who does will face much tougher punishment.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
