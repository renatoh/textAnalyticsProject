In fact, the two figures on the desk in his office in BT Centre are plastic models of Statler and Waldorf, the moaning hecklers from The Muppets, on a miniature park bench. His chauffeur and secretary gave them to him as a Christmas present. Woe betide any visitor to the Dutchman's lair who displeases him: 'If somebody goes overboard, I point to them and say \"Why don't you join them?\" They are grumpy old commentators.' Sitting in a pristine white leather armchair, he says it's 'just a bit of fun'. So how does it go down? 'What do you think?' he laughs. Presumably it doesn't always bring the house down; maybe it's something to do with different national senses of humour. But, asked if he has pointed out the Muppets to Sir Michael Rake, ex-chairman of KPMG who replaced Sir Christopher Bland in September, he suddenly becomes serious. 'No. Mike has not been a commentator.' The Dutch have a reputation for being direct, which Verwaayen certainly lives up to. Asked a straight question, he throws back a straight answer (and often a retaliatory question of his own). A bundle of nervous energy, he frequently gesticulates to get his point across. That morning, BT had reported interim results. Lower margins and restructuring costs (partly from a voluntary redundancy programme for 4,000 middle managers) helped to push shares down by 5 per cent by the end of the day. Verwaayen explains it's all part of BT redefining itself as a 'service' provider. BT runs most of the UK's trunk network, exchanges and the 'local loop' of wires connecting homes and businesses to the network. The former state monopoly used to operate all fixed phone lines. But the regulator has forced BT to open up its network to let rivals provide their own broadband and fixed-line services - known as 'local loop unbundling'. It still directly provides more than half the UK's fixed lines and wholesales most of the remainder to rivals. But these 'traditional revenues', which make up about 60 per cent of the total, are in decline. Verwaayen has been pushing the growth of 'new wave revenues', from providing communications and IT services to companies and the public sector in the UK and overseas, as well as new broadband and consumer products such as television on demand through BT Vision. Not that the public would realise the range of services the new whizz-bang BT now provides. 'You wouldn't because you have an institutional memory. You think about BT as the black phone in Granny's hallway. \"Can I make a call?\" \"Yes if you make it short.\" At best, people think of the red phone box.' Verwaayen seems to delight in proving people wrong. 'People always thought local loop unbundling would happen and BT would fall off a cliff. But there are compensating things you can do.' Rivals have complained that unbundling has not been happening quickly enough and that BT engineers give preference to their own company. At the beginning of last year, BT was forced to create a ring-fenced division called Openreach to manage and rent out its infrastructure to rivals. Out of 6,000 local exchanges, about 1,000 have been opened to competitors. Yet some rivals - notably Cable &amp; Wireless's chief executive John Pluthero - are still not happy. Verwaayen insists the Openreach service is improving. Asked about Pluthero's criticism, he says: 'I'm not going to quote on emotional comments from colleagues in the market.' He implies that Pluthero is 'emotional' over the issue because of Cable &amp; Wireless executives' controversial, highly incentivised pay package, which could see the chief executive scoop up to \u00a327m if it hits its targets. 'He's got \u00a325m at stake. You get slightly emotional. I understand that.' Ofcom is consulting on proposals to build the next generation of fibre-optic-based superfast broadband with speeds up to 100Mb, able to deliver television via the internet to all who want it. The maximum broadband speed BT delivers to homes via its copper wires is currently 8Mb. In Sweden, about half of homes have access to the new high-speed broadband, and other countries in Europe are pressing ahead with investment. Some analysts worry that the UK will fall behind and be on the wrong end of the 'digital divide'. They want BT to build a national fibre-optic network in the UK, which could cost up to \u00a311bn. Verwaayen is coy about the company's plans. The history of UK telecoms is littered with ruinously expensive whizzy new networks that are hardly used and whose roll-out bankrupted its architects. He says that BT has 'many business plans' on next generation broadband but insists: 'We will not do stupid things.' He argues that companies must first convince consumers of the benefits, such as high-definition television, that high-speed broadband can bring. 'If I knock on your door and say you can get 100Mb most people think you're talking about a disease. If I say here's a service you really want, TV, phone, blah blah, now you're talking.' The answer, he says, is to offer a 'bouquet' of services to the consumer, who doesn't care how he gets them. Any bankers hoping for a juicy mandate from buying a mobile-phone company for BT will be disappointed. Since it was forced to sell mobile arm Cellnet (renamed O2 and bought by Telefonica last year) to help clear massive debts in 2001, the City has speculated that the company could re-enter the market. Verwaayen thinks not. 'I've had to answer the question, \"Are you going to buy O2?\" 714 times. Why would we buy something of the past?' Verwaayen has run the company since 2002. With a new chairman and the company in transition, there are rumours he could step down next year. Asked if he will remain, he is non-committal: 'Time will tell. I'm not going to be pinned down on a \"When you are leaving?\" question with any specific date. I'm fully engaged, energised and passionate about this company. At the same time, it's not for me to say. When I arrived I said I would never overstay my welcome. I don't look in time in terms of beginning and end.' He bizarrely says that a chief executive can usually tell his number is up from the 'smell in the air' as staff gossip. 'I have not yet noticed the smell in the air. The most important thing in an organisation is gossip. But I don't see a change there.' Ian Livingstone, head of BT Retail, is hotly tipped to take over as chief executive. Verwaayen insists he has had no conversations with Rake about his future, but adds: 'The question to ask in a normal relationship - and we have a very good relationship - is how are you going to get continuity in a company? Of course you have a conversation about how senior management is doing, that's part of it. I'm much more relaxed about it than you.' So it's official: when the pong of gossip starts to waft up from the water coolers of BT centre to his office and his two Muppets, Verwaayen will call time on running BT.
