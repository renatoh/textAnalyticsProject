In a remarkable computer analysis which will be made available to every secondary school teacher and parent, the Department for Education will admit that too many schools outside deprived areas are relying on 'reasonable results' to say there is no need for reform. The data, to be published this week and sent to every school by the autumn, will let parents track their child's academic performance and compare it with other pupils in the same school and those at similar schools across the country. Teachers will also be able to see how well their classes are doing against others and show how well groups of pupils - for example, ethnic minority children or 13-year-old boys - are performing. In one of the biggest changes to the analysis of performance since the introduction of league tables in 1993, it is the first time such information will be made available anywhere in the world. Writing in today's Observer, David Miliband, the Schools Standards Minister, says the information will allow teachers to tailor teaching to individual children rather than offer a 'one-size fits all' service. Whitehall sources admitted it sounded the death knell to 'standard' comprehensive education, in which every pupil receives a similar type of teaching. 'From this autumn, under proposals to be unveiled by my colleague, Charles Clarke [the Education Secretary], every school will, at the click of a mouse, be able to compare and contrast the performance of individual pupils against other pupils in the school and against similar pupils in other parts of the country,' Miliband said. 'The new data is based on 'value added', the improvement made by pupils between 11 and 16, taking into account prior attainment, poverty and gender. 'It challenges the combination of poverty of expectations and culture of quiet under-achievement that can all too easily hold back pupil progress. It poses as many challenges for schools in the \"leafy suburbs\" as for those in the inner cities. 'We must raise standards in schools where results are reassuring but potential is still not fulfilled. Academic researchers call them 'coasting' schools. I know teachers in these schools are working hard. We need to give them the tools to help their pupils.' The reform comes as an Oftsed report this week will say that the Government's \u00a3800 million 'Excellence in Cities' programme has had only a 'patchy' effect on academic standards. It will add, however, that behaviour and the ethos of schools in inner-city areas has greatly improved. Ministers believe that sorting out bad behaviour is one of the keys to improving performance. Although the computer databases will be only sent to schools, education ministers will say that parents must be given access to the information. The information will show how well pupils have progressed between the ages of 11 and 16 and how much 'value' has been added to their education. One of the biggest criticisms of the original league tables was that they did not show how much a school was improving its pupils' performance. The data is likely to reveal that many inner-city schools have improved enormously since 1997 but that many schools in more comfortable, suburban areas are not doing enough. The 'most improving' school in England is in Tower Hamlets, a deprived inner-city borough in East London. The project is called Assessment for Learning and, controversially, will allow headteachers to pinpoint teachers whose classes are not performing as well as others. Failing teachers could eventually by be sacked if they are unable to improve. Every parent should be able to demand 'tailor-made teaching' for their own child, Miliband argued. At the moment present only 40 per cent of schools were using Assessment for Learning techniques to improve their schools. 'This is a reform that should animate every secondary school,' he said. 'Ofsted tells us it works, that it raises standards, but they report it is done in just four out of 10 schools. Every child, parent and teacher should expect it in their school.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
