The British number one produced a inspired performance to blunt the power of the big-serving Australian in just over three hours. Henman barely put a foot wrong in the opening set as he secured a double break before sealing it with half volley winner. However, the fifth seed won the second in controversial circumstances after breaking Philippoussis in the 11th game with a lob, which appeared to drop wide. Philippoussis tried his best to make an impact on the Henman serve in the third set but he was left extremely frustrated with the amount of close calls going against him. The Australian lost his cool at 6-5 up in the third set after the umpire failed to declare a Henman serve long and was handed a warning for audible obscenity. A charged up Philippoussis steamed through the tiebreak 7-3 but, having saved two match points on his serve in the eighth game of the fourth set, he eventually surrendered in the breaker after sailing a backhand wide. Henman will next face Croatian Mario Ancic as he bids to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals for the fifth time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
