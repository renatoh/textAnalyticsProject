Most have long recognised the need for a more co-ordinated approach to what have become increasingly sophisticated and technologically advanced criminal cartels that often use quasi-corporate methods to operate on a global basis. But while the new agency should save money, improve intelligence sharing and co-operation, and free up regional forces to tackle other crime, some commentators also warned that government must guard against elitism and trampling on the toes of local officers while failing to eradicate the secrecy and competition prevalent between some law enforcement departments. The 5,000-strong agency will create economies of scale by combining existing police units such as the National Crime Squad and National Criminal Intelligence Service with Customs investigators. I will have new financial and IT experts who, working with a new team of specialist prosecutors, should increase the chances of copper-fastening complex court cases. The government is optimistic that the new umbrella organisation will help iron out long-standing inter-departmental rivalries, and avoid costly and counter-productive duplication, which has sometimes meant separate surveillance operations on the same individuals. \"The old system worked in spite of itself but there is definitely room for improvement,\" said one senior police officer. Customs, in particular, has faced severe criticism over its handling of several recent inquiries. A Guardian investigation revealed several customs officers systematically lied in court - findings that could undermine dozens of fraud trials - and the hope is the new agency could exercise tighter control to avoid such situations arising. But some commentators doubt old problems can be swept away so easily. They say there has to be a massive shift in traditional policing culture, including a commitment to shared intelligence, and willingness to embrace new ideas for the new agency to work. \"If the history of interaction between say, customs investigators and police was hunkydory, then there wouldn't be such a hesitancy about the new force,\" said one analyst. \"Police style and culture has to be tackled before major innovations will really work. But politicians will put structural changes in place and hope the cultural ones will follow.\" \"This can't be PC Plod writ large with occasional flashes of brilliance and little accountability. It has to be a radical organisation open to a very wide range of people,\" another source cautioned. The new agency has already drawn comparison with the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) in the US, although it will concentrate on providing the analysis to undermine criminal networks rather than just solving individual cases. But many UK police chiefs hope it will cultivate an entirely different culture from the FBI, a body that has been criticised for being elitist and divorced from grass roots policing. \"It's not about rushing around with sirens blaring and guns blazing,\" said one source. \"It has to be about expert management and analysis. It also has to be something local police officers aspire to rather than griping about them and us\". \u00b7Rosie Cowan is the Guardian's crime correspondent"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
