Mercedes, which has a shareholding in the McLaren group and also supplies their formula one engines, is already committed to supplying the Force India team in 2009, but Norbert Haug, the Mercedes motorsport vice-president, said it would be possible to offer a similar deal to Honda. \"If there is a feasible solution with an investor for that team, we would be prepared to discuss it,\" Haug told autosport.com. \"But the financial background needs to be there. You cannot give any presents at this time and in this [financial] climate, but we would like to help for the sake of formula one.\" Honda announced that it would close the team last month if a seller could not be found, citing plunging global car sales as the reason."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
