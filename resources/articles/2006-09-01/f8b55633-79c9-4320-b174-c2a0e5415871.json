Fred gave G\u00e9rard Houllier's side the lead after ten minutes and the former Chelsea midfielder Tiago added a second on the half-hour mark. It was a similar story last season when the gal\u00e1cticos lost 3-0 at Lyon in their first game. Serhiy Rebrov was on target for Dynamo Kiev against Steaua Bucharest in the group's other game but the Ukrainians were overrun 4-1 at the Valery Lobanovskiy stadium, Nicolae Dica scoring twice for the visitors. Milan's Yoann Gourcuff - the young French midfielder dubbed \"the new Zinedine Zidane\" - scored the second goal as his side won 3-0 against AEK Athens. Filippo Inzaghi and Kaka, from the penalty spot, were also on target. In Manchester United's group, FC Copenhagen drew their first ever Champions League group stage game at home against Benfica 0-0. The game between Porto and CSKA Moscow in Arsenal's group, also ended goalless."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
