There is a case \u2013 albeit a controversial one \u2013 for relaxing a little and not worrying too much about succumbing to a defeat which would clear the path to second place in the group and the potential avoidance of France or the USA in the semi-final. Neville is having none of it. \u201cI\u2019m going to play my best team. I want to finish top and win the game,\u201d said England\u2019s manager. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a massive surge in momentum in the squad from winning our first two games. If we keep winning we\u2019ll be successful. I haven\u2019t even thought about trying to finish second and avoiding certain teams.\u201d More immediately Japan promise to provide an intriguing litmus test of England\u2019s evolution into a possession-based team. Asako Takakura\u2019s side are not only technically superior to the Lionesses\u2019s two previous World Cup opponents, Scotland and Argentina, but they won the tournament in 2011 and finished runners-up to the USA four years later in Canada, when they narrowly beat England in the semi-finals. At their best Takura\u2019s players turn matches into a kaleidoscopic blur of high-speed passing and even faster movement. Avoid defeat by them and England will head towards a round-of-16 game with one of the best third-placed finishers \u2013 possibly New Zealand, China or Cameroon \u2013 in Valenciennes on Sunday. Although the Lionesses were eliminated by Japan in that semi-final four years ago in Edmonton, Neville believes the class of 2015 have not had sufficient praise. \u201cPeople underestimate the quality of that team,\u201d he said. \u201cMark Sampson and the players deserve unbelievable respect. I don\u2019t like people playing down the quality of that team or the manager\u2019s contribution.\u201d Neville had turned momentarily spiky and his side have already seen two sides of the coach in France. There is the on-pitch perfectionist demanding an ambitious, high-speed possession game and the emotionally intelligent, ever-thoughtful, off-field mentor. \u201cPhil\u2019s man-management skills have been unbelievable,\u201d said the striker Toni Duggan who, having recovered from injury, is expected to start on Wednesday night. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the biggest positives I can ever say about Phil. He\u2019s been amazing.\u201d Following last Friday\u2019s 1-0 win against Argentina Fran Kirby burst into tears at the final whistle. Neville, though, had done his research and knew it would have been her late mother\u2019s birthday. He was also acutely aware that Carly Telford recently lost her own mother to cancer. His response was to draw the entire team into a huddle and talk about how proud those now relocated \u201cupstairs\u201d \u2013 including his own late father \u2013 would have been of England\u2019s progress. \u201cPhil handled Carly and Fran amazingly the other night,\u201d said Duggan. \u201cIt shows how much he cares about the players. He puts an arm round you and it means the world. He helped me through my injury and hopefully now I can repay him out on the pitch. \u201cHe\u2019s really emotional and sentimental. It\u2019s nice to see that side of him because I watched him when I was younger and growing up in Liverpool just thinking, \u2018Oh, I hate Phil Neville and Gary Neville \u2013 they play for Man United.\u2019 But he\u2019s so nice with you. Phil\u2019s really caring, he\u2019s lovely, he\u2019s thoughtful, but he demands high standards as well and you can see why he got to the top, because you don\u2019t always get to the top being really nice. He\u2019s demanded a lot from us as players but we\u2019ve taken it in our stride.\u201d A psychologist is travelling with the squad and Barcelona\u2019s Duggan feels she benefited from a private chat with her after sustaining an injury during their first training session in Nice. Some players lean heavily on the mind guru \u2013 whom the FA prefers not to name \u2013 others barely speak to her but England\u2019s entire environment as they move from hotel to hotel on their journey round France is designed to make them feel immediately at home. Every player has been equipped with a personalised mobile phone case, complete with her name and shirt number. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few gifts actually,\u201d Duggan added. \u201cWe\u2019ve also each had a little necklace off Phil. It says France \u201919. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll still be wearing it in a couple of months.\u201d Meanwhile, continuing a theme which was started two years ago at the team\u2019s Utrecht base during Euro 2017 in the Netherlands, each player\u2019s hotel room is secretly decorated with photographs of family, partners, friends and pets before they check in. On the pitch Neville has looked after his squad with a less-is-more approach to training. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very brave,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve cut it back to 40-minute sessions but, if you train hard now, you pay for it later. The easiest thing is to train, the hardest thing is to give them breaks away.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
