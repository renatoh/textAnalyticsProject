Officers were called to a building near the North Brixton Islamic Cultural Centre on Brixton Road at 11am on Wednesday following reports of spray-painted slogans on a building near the centre. A statement from the Met said: \u201cOfficers were called at around 1100hrs on 1 January to reports of anti-Islamic slogans spray-painted on a building near to the North Brixton Islamic Centre in Brixton Road. Inquiries are ongoing at this time as part of a full investigation. \u201cWe are working alongside Lambeth council to ensure the offensive remarks are removed as soon as possible.\u201d The Met added: \u201cShockingly, hate crime affects people from all walks of life and impacts on communities across London. All members of our communities have the right to go about their daily life without fear of verbal, physical or written abuse. The Met does not tolerate any form of discrimination, and we are committed to tackling offences like this as thoroughly as possible.\u201d The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, tweeted: \u201cDisgusted to hear that Islamophobic slogans have been spray painted near the North Brixton Islamic Centre. @metpoliceuk are working with Lambeth Council to have them removed, but let me be clear: all prejudice is cowardly and criminals will face the full force of the law.\u201d Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary and frontrunner for Labour\u2019s vacant position of deputy leader, echoed Khan\u2019s words, saying: \u201cIslamophobic hate is not acceptable and should not be tolerated, it is disgusting, hate has no place in our society and we should always challenge it whenever it occurs.\u201d Councillor Mohammed Seedat, Lambeth\u2019s cabinet member for community safety, said: \u201cMany of our residents fear they are living in a hostile environment. The intimidating racist graffiti on synagogues and mosques won\u2019t divide Londoners, but will confirm the worst fears of many of our residents. \u201cThe council and police will continue to reassure communities. But we also need politicians, particularly the government, to act responsibly in rhetoric and action to quell the rise of extremism and division in our society \u2013 whether it is Islamist or rightwing.\u201d Florence Eshalomi, the local Labour MP for Vauxhall, tweeted: \u201cDisturbing to hear of a racist incident at the North Brixton Islamic cultural centre \u2013 it was reported that anti-Islamic slogans had been spray-painted on [the] building opposite the cultural centre. Anyone with any information pls contact the police via 101 quoting CAD 4725/01JAN.\u201d The incident comes three days after antisemitic graffiti was sprayed across a synagogue and shops in north London during the Jewish festival of Hanukah. The Star of David, a Jewish holy symbol, and the numbers 911 were spray-painted in red and purple on premises in the Hampstead and Belsize Park area, including South Hampstead synagogue. The numbers may have been intended to refer to an antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews were responsible for the terror attack on 11 September 2001; others fear it is a reference to Kristallnacht, the violent pogrom against Jews on 9 November 1938 in Nazi Germany."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
