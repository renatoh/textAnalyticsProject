Sextet Kvelertak hail from the latter, but owe much of Br\u00e5tebrann\u2019s heavy-riffing seven minutes to the leathery pomp and speed-addled punk of West Bromwich\u2019s very own Judas Priest. Br\u00e5tebrann means \u201clumber fire\u201d in Norwegian and we can\u2019t think of anything more festive than gazing at a burning hunk of wood while a hoarse gentleman screeches in your ear. The Weeknd Heartless If the Weeknd wants you to know anything, it\u2019s that he\u2019s a right shagger. The Weeknd has slept with loads and loads of women. More women than you can ever imagine. More women than you have ever even met. Many of them are models! It\u2019s hard putting it about so much, though, and the Weeknd wants you to know that, too. \u201cRunnin\u2019 through the pussy\u201d \u2013 very much his words and not mine \u2013 can be exhausting and you know what? He only does it because he\u2019s heartbroken. Poor baby. Una Healy Set You Free What fresh hell is this? Love Island hasn\u2019t been on telly for ages now, so we\u2019re all kinds of confused by the Saturdays\u2019 Una Healy and her acoustic take on N-Trance\u2019s 1995 chart-rave hit. Naturally, it would have been the perfect fit for a covert fumble at Casa Amor, but now, with all of Mallorca presumably unoccupied, this makes no sense at all. Come back in six months, Una. Real Lies You Were in Love Back in 2014, Real Lies were pushing out post-Castlemorton bangers to mild acclaim, but now with art bae Jeremy Deller and Saatchi Gallery co-signs, acid house is once again flooding the mainstream. The wonky, dark electronics of You Were in Love is either the sound of what happens when the party\u2019s over as narrated by a postmodern Pet Shop Boys or Goldsmiths: The Musical. Either way, we\u2019re into it. Nicolas Godin ft Cola Boyy The Foundation One half of French sophisticates Air, Godin is more chic than you will ever be. This solo track is sexier than an afternoon wandering around the streets of Paris sharing a pack of filterless Gitanes with Serge Gainsbourg. Air have long been known as creators of the perfect dinner-party playlists, but be wary of sticking The Foundation on next time you have your mates over for a cassoulet, lest they start humping halfway into the burrata course."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
