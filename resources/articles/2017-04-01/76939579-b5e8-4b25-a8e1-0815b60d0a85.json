United led through Mkhitaryan\u2019s 10th goal of the season after he struck on 37 minutes and, until Leander Dendoncker\u2019s equaliser three minutes from time, Mourinho\u2019s men were in charge. However, despite their superiority, they could not capitalise. The manager said: \u201cIf I was a United defender I would be very upset with the attacking players because they have to kill the game and they didn\u2019t. The result should be much better and we can only blame ourselves because we had an easy game to play in the second half and didn\u2019t play in attack with that [killer] instinct. \u201cWe lost the ball easily too many times, we stopped our counter attacks because of sloppy touches, sloppy decisions. And then we gave them the opportunity to have some counter attacks and luckily our defenders were very much in the game and they resolved all these problems. \u201cYou have to play more seriously. We put all together the performance of two or three of our attacking players and you squeeze not much juice out of it and the people behind were not focused.\u201d Mourinho singled out the four front players who started plus Martial, a second-half substitute. \u201cMarcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Anthony I think they were very similar [not doing enough],\u201d the Portuguese said. Michael Carrick echoed his manager. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating. We were so in control but got sloppy. We have to kill teams off. We should have won that game,\u201d said the midfielder. \u201cThey had one chance and scored a header. We need to be more ruthless. It\u2019s as simple as that. \u201cWe were too comfortable. We got sloppy. It\u2019s not the end of the world but we are better than that. It\u2019s that little edge that makes the difference in the end but we\u2019ll look forward to the next game. We\u2019re still in a good position and hopefully we\u2019ll go through.\u201d United do have an away goal before next week\u2019s return leg at Old Trafford. \u201cThe result is positive. To play at home with an advantage, to start the game with an advantage, is a good result in any case,\u201d said Mourinho. Before that , though, they have Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
