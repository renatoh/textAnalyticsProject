The ex-Labor leader behind the campaign, Kevin Rudd, has been supported by a fellow prime minister from the conservative side of politics, the Liberals\u2019 Malcolm Turnbull, who put his name to the petition on the Australian parliament\u2019s website. \u201cMurdoch has become a cancer \u2013 an arrogant cancer on our democracy,\u201d Rudd, the 26th prime minister, said when he launched the petition last month. An inquiry into Murdoch\u2019s dominance in the country would \u201cmaximise media diversity ownership for the future lifeblood of our democratic system\u201d. Rudd\u2019s petition was so popular on the first weekend, it crashed the parliamentary website. The petition has been covered by international media, including the New York Times and the Jakarta Post, and is supported by the stars Hugh Grant, who is another public opponent of the Murdochs, and Bette Midler. But despite its popularity, Australia has no threshold of signatures that requires a petition to be debated in parliament, so a royal commission any time soon is highly unlikely. Without the support of either the Liberal-National Coalition or the Australian Labor Party, the petition has no political force behind it. But Rudd says what he really wants is to start a national conversation about the negative impact the media company has in Australia through its domination of the landscape and its overt support for one side of politics. Minor party the Greens has not come out in support either, and Rudd called them out on social media for going soft on Murdoch. Greens media spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young told the Guardian: \u201cThe Greens support the spirit of the petition. We do think there\u2019s a problem with media concentration in Australia.\u201d \u201cIt will take some time to convince the Labor party that it\u2019s in their interest as well,\u201d Rudd said. \u201cThat will be influenced directly by the volume of public support.\u201d But the success of his petition brought with it an equal measure of negative stories from Murdoch\u2019s newspapers in Australia \u2013 the Australian, the Daily Telegraph, the Courier Mail, the Advertiser \u2013 and his 24-hour TV network, Sky News Australia. The petition\u2019s point that Australia\u2019s print media is overwhelmingly controlled by News Corp appeared to be neatly demonstrated in real-time as the papers fell into line. \u201cWhen I put a public petition to the Australian people to sign, calling for a royal commission into the Murdoch media monopoly, I knew at that time that Murdoch at the first opportunity would take a huge whack at me,\u201d Rudd told the Guardian after the papers linked him to Jeffrey Epstein last week. The Daily Telegraph and its sister tabloids accused Rudd of knowingly accepting a donation from the disgraced financier in what was largely dismissed as a beat-up by the non-Murdoch media. \u201cIt is \u2018not credible\u2019 that former PM Kevin Rudd didn\u2019t know about a \u2018massive\u2019 US$650,000 worth of donations from sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein to his New York think-tank, home affairs minister Peter Dutton says,\u201d the Daily Telegraph reported. This week, the attacks continued when the Murdoch papers ran reports implying Rudd had links to Hunter Biden, a story referred to as a \u201csmear\u201d by the former prime minister. Rudd hit back when he published his answers to questions from the outlet in which he called Daily Telegraph editor Ben English an \u201cunapologetic Murdoch toadie\u201d who engaged in the \u201cpolitics of smear\u201d. Just as the News Corp editors studiously ignored James Murdoch\u2019s condemnation of the company\u2019s attitude towards climate change, they have largely ignored the petition. The only mention found of it was in a couple of letters to the editor. In one, the correspondent links the royal commission push to a claim that Rudd\u2019s \u201cthink tank institution has been the recipient of a large donation from disgraced paedophile, the late Jeffrey Epstein\u201d. Sky News Australia, which has an unabashed line up of rightwing commentators at night, ridiculed Rudd for the petition, saying Murdoch dominated only because \u201cpeople put their hand into their pocket for their hard-earned dollars and actually pay for [Murdoch media]\u201d. When it wasn\u2019t ignoring the petition, News Corp was claiming it was open to fraud because no identity checks are done by the parliamentary website that accepts the signatures. Sky News said there was \u201cnothing to stop people from using multiple email accounts to fraudulently increase the number of signatures\u201d. The petition has surpassed the country\u2019s biggest e-petition to parliament \u2013 the 2019 petition to declare a state of climate emergency, which gained 404,538 signatories and was presented to parliament. News Corp has been approached for comment. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2020. An earlier version incorrectly said that Hugh Grant and Bette Midler had signed the petition calling for a royal commission on Murdoch media."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
