But I am in a pickle and some impartial advice could well help me. I am in a serious relationship. Three years, living together, no kids. It has to go one way: marriage. But if I am truly honest, I do not and have never really fancied my girlfriend. I love her like crazy, but the physical spark is not there. What the hell do I do? Our lives are intertwined, as are our families. I simply don't think I can get out of this relationship without destroying so much and seriously breaking her heart. The alternative is to marry someone under these circumstances. What kind of future, sex-wise, does that offer? I haven't strayed at all yet, but I can't help thinking: what is to happen to my sex life for the rest of my life? I can't help lusting after others from afar. Pathetic, I know, but ... Any advice would be much appreciated. If only I knew the answer. The situation you outline suggests that you're damned if you leave and damned if you don't. I'd love to say that sex isn't important, that it's your emotional and intellectual relationship that counts. But I would be lying to you, and that's not very helpful. There are couples for whom sex is not important or even absent from their marriages. Such unions used to be commonplace - look at Virginia Woolf and her husband Leonard - but nowadays, with sex coming at us from every angle, it's unacceptable to have to survive on less than our perceived ration. Whether sex is an essential ingredient of a successful marriage. I'm not convinced. Or if it is, I don't think it's the swinging-from-the-chandeliers-in-a-babydoll-nightie-with-an-orange-in-your-mouth variety. Or at least not every day! The increase in our sense of sexual entitlement seems to coincide with the increase in our leisure time. Before the responsibilities of middle age, there's plenty of time, energy and appetite for sex. I'm interested in your dilemma because it's unusual. The commonly held perception is that men are led by the groin, with the brain chugging along reluctantly in its testosterone-fuelled wake. Then again, it's sex that's luring you away from what could be considered a happy relationship, so maybe yours was a once-in-a-lifetime mistake when you offered your intellect a say in choosing your mate. So what should you do? There does come a day in most relationships, followed by decades, where sex loses its pole position in our day-to-day affairs. That said, if you've never had the spark, what do you survive on in the lean years? So much of sex is not about the moment but the after-effects. Despite the foreknowledge that most of us possess - that sex in a long-term relationship and certainly post-kids will have to surrender its place at the top of our priorities - it still seems to matter enormously at the outset of any coupling. I can't rationally explain why. I'm tempted to tell you that it probably doesn't matter. Long term, both of you will end up browsing Ikea catalogues in bed instead of writhing in baby oil, just like the rest of us. However, as you are three years into your life together and forced to choose between making that a lifetime or quitting before it's too late, my instincts are, however painful it is for both of you, for you to extricate yourself now. Knowing that sex will eventually take a lesser role and allowing that to happen prematurely are two very different things. Your girlfriend deserves someone who longs for her body and soul. That she's oblivious to your feelings doesn't make that any less her right. All I can hope is that airing this 'guilty secret' will let you scrutinise your feelings from a fresh perspective. Should you decide on the most challenging path - and unravel your current union - can I offer one last, perhaps unusual, bit of advice? Don't be honest about it. Pointing out a person's flaws is one thing, whether it's jealousy or dental hygiene, but telling someone you've shared a bed with that you no longer desire them is downright cruel. It's one of the shortest conduits to despair because it's not down to anything that can be improved upon. It promotes feelings of sub-zero self-esteem and does serious emotional damage. Far better to tell her that you're not quite ready for the big commitment, that you need to get some single living out of your system, and that she's beautiful, clever and sexy but sadly not for you at this time. If you have to be cruel to be kind, it doesn't rule out being kind in the process. It's a shame that so few people practise the art of the break-up as much as they immerse themselves in the art of seduction. To be a real expert you must embrace all aspects of your subject.
