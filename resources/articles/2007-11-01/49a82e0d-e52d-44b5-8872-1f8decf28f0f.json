A day after Yorkshire Water owner Kelda revealed a \u00a33bn bid came news that waste management group Biffa had rejected a \u00a31bn offer. Private equity firms Montagu and Hg Capital said they had approached Biffa - spun off from Severn Trent just over a year ago - on September 4 with a view to making a bid at a premium to the then 247.5p share price. This was rejected, although the duo have bought a 2.4% stake, have funding in place and seem keen to pursue their target. Montagu has experience in this area. This year it sold Cory Environmental for \u00a3588m after buying it for \u00a3200m in 2005. Graham Neale at Killik &amp; Co said a sensible takeout price for Biffa would be 337p to 362p. \"This is a higher multiple than some other deals in the sector, but Biffa owns a large part of its landfill capacity and there is a limited amount of land in the UK which has planning permission for landfill.\" Biffa ended 64.5p higher at 325p, a 25% increase on the day. Overall, the market ended a tricky week on a positive note. Dealers were anxiously awaiting Wall Street's opening after Thanksgiving, and in the event the Dow Jones rose 181 points during a curtailed trading session. Despite the state of the US economy, investors are hoping the key Christmas shopping period which began yesterday will not disappoint. With the positive performance across the Atlantic and a smattering of bid speculation, the FTSE 100 ended up 106.8 points at 6262.1. Apart from utilities, much of the takeover talk surrounded the miners. Vedanta Resources added 136p to \u00a320.36 on suggestions that a Chinese state mining company was keen to make a move at \u00a327 a share. Anglo American added 171p to \u00a329.80 on revived speculation that rival Xstrata, up 149p to \u00a330.18, might bid in the wake of the BHP Billiton offer for Rio Tinto. Anglo also benefited from a positive note from analysts at HSBC. The bank upgraded from neutral to overweight with a \u00a335 price target. It said: \"Share price retracement on growth fears seems overdone. We remain constructive on the commodity price cycle. Anglo's asset restructuring [should] be complete in 2008 with the prospect of further share buybacks.\" To help things along, copper and gold prices also moved higher yesterday. Pubs group Mitchells &amp; Butlers moved up 43p to 641p ahead of full-year results next week, when analysts hope for more news of its property plans. Although a joint venture with entrepreneur Robert Tchenguiz has been delayed, some company followers expect it to announce plans for a real estate investment trust (Reit). Rival Enterprise Inns added 11p to 561p. Citigroup issued a buy note, saying: \"Enterprise has the most resilient pub operating model. Some 45% of its profits come from rents paid one month in advance, representing a visible and secure earnings stream. Historically, this operating model has been resilient to short-term fluctuations in consumer spending.\" But it cut its price target to 650p from 859p, to reflect doubts about its potential for Reit status. Blue Oar Securities maintained its hold rating after the company gave a presentation to the broker on Thursday, saying Christmas is more important than ever given the prospect of slowing consumer spending next year and no English presence at Euro 2008 to boost next year's takings. \"Conversion to a Reit is still a possibility,\" said Blue Oar. \"\u00a31bn of value could accrue but there is no timetable nor guarantee of success.\" Elsewhere, broadcaster ITV added 0.9p to 83.9p on vague talk of stakebuilding, while BT was 8.75p better at 291p after analysts at MF Global moved from neutral to buy with a 360p target. Housebuilders moved higher, partly on the feeling their shares had been oversold, and partly on hopes of a rate cut following weak UK GDP figures for the third quarter. Taylor Wimpey rose 14.2p to 196.2p, while Barratt Developments was 24.75p better at 484.25p. Intermediate Capital, which helps fund leveraged buyouts, jumped 190p to \u00a316.50 after it announced a 33% increase in half-year profits and said the current credit turmoil presented it with the best opportunity it has had for 10 years. On the way down was British Gas owner Centrica, 7.75p lower at 347.75p. Analysts at ABN Amro argued this week that Centrica would benefit from buying British Energy, down 3.5p to 488p. \"Centrica would improve its competitive position and gain cheap access to an economic hedge against rising gas prices by acquiring British Energy,\" said ABN, adding that it believed any competition issues could be overcome. Transport group Stagecoach also went into reverse, down 10.25p to 242.25p. JP Morgan moved its recommendation from neutral to underweight and said: \"We think investors should be moving now to take profits, with a view to revisiting the stock at lower levels.\" A day after warning on profits due to the English football team's dismal dismissal from Euro 2008, Mike Ashley's Sports Direct International fell another 2.75p to 93.25p. Citigroup - one of the banks involved in February's flotation of the company at 300p a share - cut its target price from 160p to 100p. \"We continue to argue that ahead of sustained evidence of materially improved earnings visibility (in the light of another profit warning) and in the absence of bid speculation (its founder owns 67% of the shares), Sports Direct should trade on a discount to its mid-cap sector peers,\" said Citi. Carbon credit specialist AgCert International slipped 0.25p to 5p on talk it had started notifying rivals - initially in the US - that they may be infringing its patents. If it fails to reach agreement, it might seek redress in the courts. Analysts at Dawnay, Day Corporate Broking said: \"We suspect that this going to be a costly pursuit in time and money.\" nick.fletcher@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
