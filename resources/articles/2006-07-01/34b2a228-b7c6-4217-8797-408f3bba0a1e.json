The sombre, restrained pieces for unaccompanied chorus that make up Orpheus Behind the Wire, completed in 1983, are settings of poems by Edward Bond, who was the librettist for two of Henze's operas We Come to the River and The English Cat, but the provenance of the 2004 \"dramma per musica\" Aristaeus, for reciter and orchestra is much more complicated. Its five sections bring together music from a number of Henze's Orpheus-inspired works composed in the late 1970s - the Orpheus dance drama (to a scenario by Bond), the dark-hued orchestral Barcarola, and the Violin Sonata - as well as a few newly composed numbers, linking them with a series of spoken texts written by Henze himself to tell the story of Orpheus and Eurydice from the point of view of Aristaeus, the beekeeper who in some versions of the story was responsible for Eurydice's death. It's curiously successful, for much of Henze's music retains its dramatic power and though sometimes overblown, the text is touching too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
