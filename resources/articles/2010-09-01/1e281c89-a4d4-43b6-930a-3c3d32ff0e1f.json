Drivers of vehicles not registered at residential addresses in Surrey, or motorists attempting to dump trade waste will be turned away. The aim is to stop trade waste being dumped at community recycling centres for free. Traders will be sent to a weigh station, where they will be charged for the disposal of their waste, and residents will be asked to apply for a permit. A spokesperson for Surrey told GC News that the app was created in-house. The council said it hopes the scheme, which is believed to be the first of its kind in England, will help stop residents \"forking out \u00a31m a year\" to dispose of trade waste. \"I believe Surrey is leading the way by being the first local authority to use mobile technology in this way,\" said cabinet member for environment Lynne Hack. \"The scheme has been well received, not least because local taxpayers know they're not footing the bill for waste they don't produce.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
