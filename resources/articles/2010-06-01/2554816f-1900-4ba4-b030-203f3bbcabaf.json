Corporal Taniela Tolevu Rogoiruwai, 32, and Kingsman Ponipate Tagitaginimoce, 29, died during separate security patrols in the Nad-e Ali district of Helmand province on Tuesday. The men, named by the Ministry of Defence, were both members of the 1st Battalion the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment. Rogoiruwai, killed in a firefight with insurgents, was described by the battalion's commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Frazer Lawrence as an outstanding soldier and a very talented NCO who was \"tough and stoic, but with an infectious smile and a mischievous sense of humour\". His family said in a statement that he had been \"a loving husband who dedicated his life to his work and especially his family. He will be sorely missed by his friends, workmates and especially by his wife and three-year-old son, Matthew.\" Tagitaginimoce died while trying to help another soldier during an exchange of fire. He had been in Afghanistan for three months. Lawrence, describing his work in Afghanistan as exemplary, said: \"He epitomised the qualities of a Fijian Kingsman \u2013 strong yet gentle, compassionate, principled and honourable, and with a real sense of right and wrong.\" Tagitaginimoce's wife said he was \"a loving husband and a wonderful father\". Defence secretary Liam Fox, extending his \"deepest sympathies\" to the men's families said: \"They had both excelled on operations in the past in the tough conditions of Afghanistan. They died working to bring stability to the Nad-e Ali district, an area vital to the success of our operation.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
