In that time, the charts have grown, with dedicated countdowns covering singles and albums as well as compilations and even genre- and format-specific charts. It has weathered the hype-heavy multi-formatting wars of the 1980s and 1990s, finally bending to digital with the introduction of downloads in 2004. A decade later, streams were added, marking the first time the UK chart measured anything outside of pure sales. As the market rapidly evolves so too must the chart if it wants to cling to any vestige of relevance: the latest changes will see video streams added for the first time and a new weighting system applied to \u201cpremium\u201d streams (those on paid subscription services) and \u201cfree\u201d streams (those on ad-supported services like YouTube and the free tier of Spotify). When streams were first added to the singles chart in 2014, a conversion metric was arrived at where 100 streams would \u201cequal\u201d one sale \u2013 as sales were the only thing the chart had been built on. As streaming became the new centre of gravity for the record business, that had to be recalibrated and so, at the start of 2017, it was announced that 150 streams would equal one \u201csale\u201d. The latest changes, effective from the chart published on 6 July, will see a new metric of 100 premium streams or 600 ad-supported streams equalling one \u201csale\u201d. Even though markets like France, Germany, Italy and Spain now exclude ad-supported streams from their charts entirely, the Official Charts Company in the UK felt they had to be included to give a fuller picture of the consumption and popularity of music in its charts. \u201cWe think it is important to count the free streams as there are people who cannot afford to pay for a subscription or may not have access to credit cards,\u201d says Martin Talbot, chief executive of the OCC. \u201cThey could be young kids or teenagers who don\u2019t have credit cards \u2013 or it could be low-income families. It could count against certain genres of music if we stripped those out completely.\u201d Is there a concern that by giving greater weight to paid streams and less weight to free streams that young consumers \u2013 the lifeblood of a healthy singles chart and the heaviest users of free streaming platforms \u2013 will see their contribution dramatically diluted and the chart become fusty and middle aged? Talbot argues that this will not be the case, referencing a \u201cshadow\u201d chart the OCC has been quietly running alongside the public chart for the past year to spot and snag anomalies. He claims that the only change is that newer tracks might enter the top 40 a few places higher and older tracks might slip out of the chart a few weeks quicker. \u201cIt\u2019s not like suddenly there will be loads of Led Zeppelin and Rolling Stones in the chart,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is not what will happen. Yes, there are young people who use free streaming services; but there are also young people who use video which we haven\u2019t previously been counting. Free services like YouTube are a significant part of their discovery of music so we are including all of that.\u201d On the video side, this is partly a response to a blurring of the lines between audio and video platforms, with Spotify and Apple Music slowly adding videos, the plays of which had previously not counted towards the chart and which may have been cannibalising the audio streams on those same services. There are, however, some important category caveats here. Free streams of official videos on YouTube will fall into the 600-streams-equals-one-sale bracket, but streams of videos on YouTube\u2019s new subscription service, on Apple Music or on the paid tier of Spotify will fall into the 100-streams bracket. Plays of UGC (user-generated content) videos \u2013 like fan-created lyric videos or lip-sync videos \u2013 will not count. This is in part to avoid a repeat of the embarrassingly unfortunate timing of the addition of video streams to the US chart in early 2013 just as the short-lived and meme-centric Harlem Shake was reaching its peak. While the OCC is not ruling out the inclusion of UGC videos in the future, for now they will have no impact on the chart. It is all a pencil-chewing set of metrics for the average fan to wrap their head around but, for the record industry, it is essentially reverse-engineering the revenue generated by these different types of streams (where a paid stream delivers a higher royalty micropayment than a free stream) and working out the fiscal equivalent of a paid download. What this may result in is a new marketing focus by labels to push users to the more \u201cvaluable\u201d types of streams on paid services. They are unlikely to window key singles on the free and paid tiers of Spotify, for example, but they will be working on ways to push users to take out subscriptions. The long-term impact for YouTube could be more profound. This could see unofficial videos scrubbed from the service or mounting pressure on the video platform to tweak its algorithms to bump up chart-eligible official videos and downrank chart-ineligible UGC ones in its search results and algorithms. For the past few years, the industry has been railing against the \u201cvalue gap\u201d on YouTube where streams there are worth considerably less in monetary terms than those on a service like Spotify. Don\u2019t rule out the new war on YouTube being about the \u201cchart-eligible gap\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
