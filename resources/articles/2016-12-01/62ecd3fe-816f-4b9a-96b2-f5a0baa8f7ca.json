At his longest and probably last press conference at the White House before making way for Donald Trump, Obama became emotional as he spoke of feeling responsible when children in Syria are killed by snipers or atrocities are committed around the world. The president who began his tenure winning the Nobel peace prize ended it in a throwback to the cold war, condemning President Vladimir Putin not only over Russia\u2019s aggression in Aleppo but also regarding cyber-attacks on the US presidential election. Obama had personally told Putin to \u201ccut it out\u201d, he said. The press briefing room at the White House was so crowded for Obama\u2019s final end-of-year summation that one journalist fainted and required medical attention. Although the first African American president reeled off a list of achievements, from reducing unemployment to expanding healthcare to rapprochement with Cuba, as proof that the US is significantly better off than when he succeeded George W Bush in 2009, it has been increasingly evident Syria will cast a shadow on his legacy. \u201cThe world as we speak is united in horror at the savage assaults by the Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian allies on the city of Aleppo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen a deliberate strategy of surrounding, besieging and starving innocent civilians. We\u2019ve seen relentless targeting of humanitarian workers and medical personnel, [neighborhoods] reduced to rubble and dust. There are continuing reports of civilians being executed. These are all horrific violations of international law.\u201d He added forcefully: \u201cResponsibility for this brutality lies in one place alone, with the Assad regime and its allies, Russia and Iran, and this blood and these atrocities are on their hands.\u201d The near six-year civil war in Syria has been an intractable problem for Obama, who was widely criticised for drawing a \u201cred line\u201d over the use of chemical weapons then failing to enforce it. The president called for an impartial international observer force in Aleppo, full access for humanitarian aid and a broad ceasefire. He was asked if he felt any personal moral responsibility at the end of his presidency for the carnage of Aleppo. \u201cI always feel responsible,\u201d the president replied. \u201cI felt responsible when kids were being shot by snipers. I felt responsible when millions of people had been displaced. I feel responsible for murder and slaughter that\u2019s taken place in South Sudan that\u2019s not being reported on, partly because there\u2019s not as much social media being generated from there. \u201cThere are places around the world where horrible things are happening and because of my office, because I\u2019m president of the United States, I feel responsible. I ask myself every single day, is there something I could do that would save lives and make a difference and spare some child who doesn\u2019t deserve to suffer? So that\u2019s a starting point. There\u2019s not a moment during the course of this presidency where I haven\u2019t felt some responsibility.\u201d But weeks\u2019 worth of meetings with military officials, aid agencies, diplomats and outside critics failed to find a solution, he confessed. There was no appetite for sending in large numbers of US troops without an international law mandate or support from Congress when there will still boots on the ground in Iraq after a decade of war that cost trillions of dollars. There would also be confrontation with \u201cmilitary superpower\u201d in Russia and Iran. \u201cAnd in that circumstance, unless we were all in and willing to take over Syria, we were going to have problems. And everything else was tempting because we wanted to do something and it sounded like the right thing to do but it was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap. And in that circumstance, I have to make decision as president of the United States as to what is best. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Contrary to the claims of Russia and the Bashar al-Assad regime, he said, tens of thousands of people were still trapped in Aleppo and prepared to leave under any conditions. The US would continue to put pressure to get them out. Trump, who will be inaugurated on 20 January, has called for the creation of \u201csafe zones\u201d in Syria. Asked for his view, Obama said: \u201cI will help President-elect Trump with any advice, counsel, information that we can provide so that he, once he\u2019s sworn in, can make a decision.\u201d Putin also dominated Obama\u2019s remarks about the US presidential election following reports that US intelligence agencies believe he personally directed the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairperson, John Podesta. He said he spoke with Putin in September and told him to \u201ccut it out\u201d. It seemed to work, he added, but by then Podesta\u2019s emails were already in the possession of WikiLeaks. He criticised Republicans for warming to Putin, suggesting that they were helping Russia undermine American democracy. Although Russia, he said, was a weaker country that did not innovate, he noted frankly: \u201cMr Putin can weaken us just like he\u2019s trying to weaken Europe if we start buying into notions that it\u2019s OK to intimidate the press, or lock up dissidents, or discriminate against people because of their faith or what they look like. \u201cWhat I worry about \u2013 more than anything \u2013 is the degree to which because of the fierceness, because of the partisan battle, you start to see certain folks in the Republican party and Republican voters suddenly finding a government and individuals who stand contrary to everything that we stand for as being OK, because that\u2019s how much we dislike Democrats.\u201d Referring to a president revered by Republicans for winning the cold war, he added: \u201cRonald Reagan would roll over in his grave.\u201d And in one of several digs at the media, he remarked: \u201cIf fake news being released by some foreign government is almost identical to reports that are being issued through partisan news venues, then it\u2019s not surprising that that foreign propaganda will have a greater effect, because it doesn\u2019t seem so far-fetched.\u201d But throughout the press conference, Obama studiously avoided direct criticisms of Trump, describing him as \u201cstill in transition mode\u201d. He said their telephone conversations were \u201ccordial\u201d and not \u201cdefensive in any way\u201d. He said he advised Trump to \u201cthink it through\u201d before making any changes to the \u201cone-China\u201d policy. Trump has said he would not feel bound by the decades-old policy in which the US recognises Taiwan as part of China."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
