The last shot is a peach, and there are tiny payoffs in every scene as the show\u2019s principle of not vocalising its emotions is relaxed by just the right amount. In the middle, though, is one heart-stopping moment of sadness and rage to remind us that all this sunny kookiness is underscored by grief. Exquisite. Jack Seale Summer of Rockets 9pm, BBC Two As Stephen Poliakoff\u2019s spy drama continues, Samuel is whisked away to recuperate from the shooting; but, since his protection is being organised by Field (Mark Bonnar), this is not all that reassuring. Meanwhile, Kathleen (Keeley Hawes) infiltrates a pocket of 1950s society almost as secretive as MI5: the vegetarians. Ellen E Jones Wild Bill 9pm, ITV Now that the introductions have been completed in Dudi Appleton\u2019s comedy-drama, we can get on with some meatier plotlines as American chief constable Bill Hixon\u2019s policing techniques begin to win him some friends in Lincolnshire. Enjoy the Piano Man mystery (a tour de force from actor Craig Parkinson). MB The Restaurant That Makes Mistakes 9pm, Channel 4 Week two of a life-affirming programme following a group of people with different forms of young-onset dementia as they staff an experimental restaurant. Former business owner Peter relishes the chance to contact prospective customers, while ex-driver Roger takes his first order. Hannah J Davies Gomorrah 9pm, Sky Atlantic With Ciro dead and Naples set for an all-out war, clan boss Gennaro, a man given to communicating almost exclusively in Catholic metaphors, turns to the sinister Levante family capo for help. A thrilling double-bill opener to season four of Roberto Saviano\u2019s intoxicating underworld saga. Best drama of the week. MB Massive Engineering Mistakes 9pm, Discovery Channel Even the tiniest mistake can mean disaster for big architectural projects. In this 10-part series it\u2019s fun to hear experts give accounts of why half a Baltimore street disappeared into a railway cutting and the design fault that almost scuppered London\u2019s Millennium Bridge. MB Film choice Lucky (John Carroll Lynch, 2017) 12.10am, Sky Cinema Premiere He had one more film left in him (Frank and Ava), but this was the late actor Harry Dean Stanton\u2019s real swansong: his 90-year-old Lucky, wizened and wise, smokes a pack a day but is in rude enough health to practise yoga, and contemplate his long life and what lies ahead in John Carroll Lynch\u2019s poignant movie. Paul Howlett Sport choice World Cup Cricket: New Zealand v South Africa 10am, Sky Sports Cricket. Early pace-setters New Zealand face faltering South Africa.
