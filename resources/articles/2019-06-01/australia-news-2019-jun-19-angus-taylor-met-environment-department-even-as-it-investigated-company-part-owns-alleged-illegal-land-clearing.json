Taylor, who was minister for cities at the time, had meetings in 2017 to discuss the federal government\u2019s designation of a critically endangered grassland species. At the time of the meeting requests, federal and state investigations were under way into the alleged poisoning of 30 hectares that contained the grass species on a property in New South Wales\u2019s Monaro region owned by Jam Land Pty Ltd. One of the directors of that company is Richard Taylor, the minister\u2019s brother, and the minister himself holds an interest in the firm via his family investment company, Gufee. Angus Taylor has previously denied on the record that he intervened in the investigation of the alleged illegal clearing of the critically endangered grasslands on the property near Delegate. In April, in response to the issue being raised in Senate estimates, a spokesperson for the minister told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe minister has not made any representations to federal or state authorities in relation to this investigation. This is entirely a matter for Jam Land.\u201d The ministerial code of conduct says ministers must \u201cmake arrangements to avoid conflicts of interests arising from their investments\u201d and \u201cit is critical that ministers do not use public office for private purposes\u201d. In response to questions from the Guardian, Taylor today said he asked for meetings in his \u201ccapacity as the local member for Hume.\u201d It can now be revealed that Taylor had detailed talks with senior department officials and the office of Josh Frydenberg \u2013 who was the environment minister at the time \u2013 about the very laws that were at the centre of the investigation involving his brother. Documents obtained under freedom of information by Guardian Australia show Frydenberg\u2019s office in 2017 sought meetings for Taylor with department officials about the decision to upgrade protection of natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands to critically endangered. The grasslands were listed as critically endangered under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act by the former environment minister, Greg Hunt, in 2016. They had previously been listed as \u201cendangered\u201d and have been protected under national law since 2000. But the 2016 changes had infuriated farmers in the Monaro, notably Richard Taylor, who was quoted in the rural press opposing the laws. Emails obtained by Guardian Australia show Frydenberg\u2019s office raised the grasslands protections with the Department of the Environment and Energy on 8 March, just a day after officials from the same department met with Jam Land to discuss potential contraventions of the EPBC Act. An email sent on 9 March on behalf of Geoff Richardson, the department\u2019s assistant secretary for the protected species and communities branch, records that Frydenberg\u2019s office pointed to \u201cthe recent email traffic on the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands EC [ecological community]\u201d. \u201cHe [a person in Frydenberg\u2019s office whose name has been redacted] started quizzing me on the changed definition, and I gave him some basic information on the thresholds that were applied in the new listing in 2016,\u201d the email said. \u201cHe is now keen for [redacted] and I to meet with Angus Taylor to answer questions on the technical aspects of the listing outcome. \u201cHe made the point that for farmers in Monaro this is \u2018the number 1 issue\u2019 of concern for them.\u201d \u201cWhen I tried to draw him on how the \u2018issue\u2019 was manifesting, ie stopping them from doing stuff on their land, or confusion over the definition and therefore what might constitute a significant impact, he couldn\u2019t really explain it.\u201d Richardson told his colleagues that before agreeing to a meeting, he needed a full picture of any \u201cdepartmental sensitivities including any compliance action under way\u201d, noting that departmental officers would \u201cstay out of that [the compliance action] completely\u201d. The email went to senior department staff, including Monica Collins, who at that time was the department\u2019s assistant secretary for compliance and enforcement, the special office that manages investigations and prosecutions into breaches. A day later Richardson sent another email saying they needed to get together to \u201cfully understand the compliance action that is under way\u201d, highlighting that at least in the officials\u2019 minds, these requests for meetings were extremely sensitive. But Frydenberg\u2019s office continued to push for a meeting between the department and Taylor. \u201cI am meeting with Angus Taylor at 11am on Monday at APH [Parliament House] to discuss the listing of the Monaro grasslands. Geoff, I need you there to discuss history, consultation, thresholds, practicalities, etc. Monica, it would be good to have you there also if you can make it,\u201d a person in the minister\u2019s office, whose name was redacted, wrote. The Monaro region is not in Taylor\u2019s electorate although some of the critically endangered species do stretch into Hume. Richardson met with Taylor on 20 March. The department had prepared a briefing document on the grasslands which explained that the species had been protected since 2000 and that, collectively, temperate grasslands are among the most threatened vegetation in Australia, with only about 5% remaining in relatively undisturbed condition. The briefing also stated there was wide consultation before the decision to upgrade the species to critically endangered was made. \u201cThere is a perception of a significant burden, but the regulatory impact due to ecological community listings has historically been minor for individual landholders and agriculture,\u201d the department said. In response to questions from Guardian Australia, Angus Taylor said: \u201cIn early 2017, I received a briefing in my capacity as the local member for Hume, on a revised listing under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. \u201cThe purpose of the briefing was to understand the technical aspects of the revised listing and its impact on those affected, which included many constituents in my electorate. \u201cI did not make any representations to federal or state authorities in relation to any compliance action being undertaken.\u201d An environment and energy department spokesperson said the compliance official, Monica Collins, did not attend and has not attended any meeting with Taylor relating to grasslands or any other matter despite the emails showing she had been asked to. But the department said it was aware of the compliance action involving Taylor\u2019s part-owned company prior to the meeting and the spokesperson said officials \u201cdid not discuss the matter with Taylor\u201d. \u201cThe purpose of the meeting was to outline the technical aspects of the grasslands listing which had been raised as the number one issue of concern to farmers in the Monaro region,\u201d the spokesperson said. On 24 March, Richardson wrote again to colleagues that \u201cfollowing our meeting with Angus Taylor on Monday, we are exploring options to deal with the concerns raised related to the natural temperate grasslands of the south-eastern highlands ecological community\u201d. \u201cSince the meeting, we have had some initial discussions with the regional Local Land Services office,\u201d the email said. \u201cThere appears to be little confusion about interpreting the refined definition, so we are focusing our thinking on clarifying when a particular action may have a significant impact on the listed community, and thus potentially trigger the EPBC Act.\u201d Emails sent in April show Taylor continued to raise his concerns with Frydenberg\u2019s office which then raised it with his department, though it is unclear whether there were more face-to-face meetings. The emails show that by then the secretary of the environment department, Gordon de Brouwer, was being copied into discussions as the department pushed back on altering the laws. By late April the NSW environment department dropped its prosecution of Jam Land, saying the scientific evidence that native grassland had been cleared was inconclusive. Guardian Australia sought additional documents regarding the federal investigation but these have been denied on the grounds that the investigation is ongoing. The natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands is still listed as critically endangered. The department\u2019s spokesperson said \u201cthe compliance action in the Monaro is ongoing\u201d. \u2022 How to contact the Guardian securely"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
