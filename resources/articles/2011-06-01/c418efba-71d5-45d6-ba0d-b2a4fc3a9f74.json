The result was Trout Mask Replica, four sides of wild invention that felt improvised, but was the product of eight months' intense rehearsal by his Magic Band, under often agonising conditions. Lowest-fi Delta blues, beat-poetic scattered logic, broken beautiful pop, squawking, jagged jazz-rock \u2013 these artful shards composed a mosaic whole that has eluded many while profoundly enchanting some. Its redrawing of rock's aesthetic frontiers \u2013 its fearless freedom \u2013 has inspired outsider musicians for more than 40 years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
