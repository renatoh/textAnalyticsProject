So to suggest the region as a great place to go skiing is to invite a fair amount of scepticism. But if you ignore complaints that the Sol y Nieve resort in the Sierra Nevada is not the prettiest, and scuff your heels at the snobs who look down from their lofty Alpine heights, then a good time can be had by all. Any doubts I had as to the potential of the resort vanished as I rode the telecabin to Borreguiles, swaying up the sheeted white to the jagged-toothed peak of Veleta. It's strange to stand amid all that snow gusting around the twin-domed observatory, looking down on the hard rock browns of the Vega of Granada. And when you catch an occasional glimpse of Africa's Rif mountains, or the sunset goes blood red, you breath in the sheer romance of skiing in Spain. Sol y Nieve resort has its drawbacks. Prado Llano, the central town, was built to serve skiing, so it is thoroughly modern and lacks the charm or character of a real mountain village. It's really a collection of shops and apartments, built on top of an underground car park. But it boasts something few Northern resorts can: almost constant sunshine, which in March turns the slopes into a beauty contest of bikinis and T-shirts. Indeed, with a season that can stretch from the end of November until May 3 it's the longest in Europe. The Sierra's gentle slopes and wide runs make it good for beginners and intermediate skiers, not to mention noisy snowboarders in those irritating clown hats. When they are all open, the total length stretches to 62km. If the snow fails, and even if it doesn't, Granada is only half an hour away. In winter, there are few lovelier sights than the Alhambra's delicate red brown walls, etched against a towering backdrop of hard white. Then there is the sea and the prospect of swimming in the morning and skiing in the afternoon. The coastal towns of Motril and Almu\u00f1eca are just over an hour away, while after 1pm you can ride to the top of the mountain for \u00a312. How to get there Packages are not cheap compared with Andorra. Try JMC (0870 6075085, from \u00a3389pp per week half board). Exodus (020-8675 5550, sales@exodustravels.co.uk) is running a brand-new four-day multi-activity holiday for confident skiers, involving ski mountaineering, skiing, mountain biking and canyoning for \u00a3650 plus Pta30,000 for food and lift pass. easyJet (www.easyjet.com) flies London Luton to Malaga from \u00a365 return Equipment A six-day pass costs around \u00a375, and hire of skis, boots and poles from around \u00a335 per week. For the cheapest rentals, head for the outlets situated away from the telecabin. There is a choice of more than 20 ski schools, One of the biggest, the International School (+34 958 48 01 42, www.eie.es - daily classes, \u00a39; individual classes \u00a318), is the oldest in Spain with helpful instructors of several nationalities. At the cheaper end is Granada Aventura (+ 34 630 941 806, five days' tuition \u00a350), which will also arrange private tours of Granada and excursions such as flamenco nights. Facilities The resort is controlled by Cetursa, one of those strange Spanish hybrids - part municipal, part private -which can cause problems. Visitors often wonder why the road up to the hotels and apartments doesn't have better public transport or why the chairlift, at least to the village landing stations, isn't free and open 24 hours. Surprisingly, there is no Independent Tourist Office, though the Cetursa people are helpful, and there is a small information bureau. In addition, Prado Llano now has a new little ice rink and a sports club - the Club Trevenque: day's entry costs \u00a312. Where to stay Outside they may be ugly, but inside most of the hotels and hostels are of a good quality. At the top end are the Melia chain hotels, The Sierra Nevada and the excellent Sol y Nieve (+34 958 480 803/ 872), with its personal ski lockers and Greco-Roman swimming pool - twins start around \u00a395 per night. The most appealing middle range hotel is the chalet-style Kenia Nevada (+ 34 958 48 09 11, kenesa@arrakis.es). Doubles with breakfast cost around \u00a376 per night. For an excellent and exclusive little hotel, there is the Maribel (+34 958 48 10 19, hmaribel@eurociber.es), \u00a390 per night for a double with lovely views. For apartment accommodation, try the Trevenque (+34 958 48 08 62, aptrevenque@cetursa.es). A one-bedroom apartment for four people costs \u00a395 per night. Otherwise contact the main reservations office (+34 958 24 91 11, agencia@cetursa.es). The Spanish are good at catering to family holidays, and hotels such as the Sol y Nieve have their own play groups and entertainers. There is also a brand new Infant Ski School. Where to eat The best restaurant in town is the Ruta de Veleta, though it will set you back \u00a336 a head. The Andulsi is another winner, and for a blow out don't miss the buffet in the Melia Sol y Nieve. For tapas, my favourites are the Copo Patanegra Jamon Serrano and the truly authentic Cartujano, in the shopping mall opposite the Melia Sierra Nevada. Where to drink There are plenty of bars in the area, but for a log fire, cushions, tapestries and a bit of arabesque chic try the relaxed Crescendo. If you are feeling particularly peckish, the bar menu features hamburgers and fajitas. The Tia Maria is hip and La Cu\u00f1a more sophisticated, with its view into the throat of the valley. Jaleo is popular too, but your instructors will know the best haunts. The bars in town tend to close before midnight, which is the cue for the discos up the hill to step into action. Sticky Fingers, El Chicle and Soho are the most fun places to dance away the night.
