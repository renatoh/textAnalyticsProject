Spurs would offer to buy the stadium and lease it back to the FA for England games and FA Cup semi-finals and the final. The plan, which would require Spurs to take on huge debts, is considered a long shot even by club insiders but demonstrates their desire to move to a bigger stadium. A larger ground is a priority for the north London club and their No1 option is to move into the London Olympic Stadium in 2012, with the capacity reduced from 80,000 to around 60,000. However, Tottenham may face opposition from West Ham, who are being circled by investors, led by Kia Joorabchian, who consider a possible move to the Olympic Stadium as a major part of the club's appeal. There will also be opposition from the mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, who says that he will subsidise a permanent athletics facility rather than let the ground go to an anchor tenant. Spurs are well ahead of West Ham in the lobbying game and have already approached Keith Mills, the former deputy chairman of the London 2012 bid, about taking up a non-executive role on the board. Mills declined but others involved in London's bid may yet find themselves approached. Caborn set for Burns blast The FA Council's failure to adopt the Burns Review at Tuesday's meeting is in direct defiance of Richard Caborn. The sports minister had let it be known that if Burns was not in place by the time parliament returns from its summer recess on October 9 he would shame the FA by mentioning the prevarication over Burns in the House of Commons. It just so happens that the first session after the opening is culture, media and sport questions, and a friendly inquiry will be planted to allow the Caborn to let rip. The threat was insufficient to sway councillors opposed to the appointment of an independent chairman, and they will not meet again to make a decision until October 27. The size of the task facing the pro-Burns lobby is demonstrated that just one national game representative, Doug Insole, spoke in favour of adopting Burns in full at the meeting. Agents fall on hard times Evidence that the Football League's new agent regulations are starting to have an effect comes from a club chairman who reports that the ban on clubs paying agents - only players are permitted to pay the middle men under the new rules - has already led one of his players to ditch his representative. The player, who was amicably renegotiating his contract with the chairman, baulked at paying the \u00a330,000 demanded by his agent after the club refused to pay up. The player returned the following day to sign his contract with his father acting as his representative. George's shirt is Best buy George Best never did anything by half, as Northampton Town discovered in 1970. In his first match after a six-week ban, Best scored six goals as Manchester United thrashed the Cobblers 8-2 in the FA Cup. The shirt he wore that day, pictured left, was originally won in a competition in 1996 but it was sold to an anonymous buyer at Christie's auction house in London yesterday for \u00a324,000. Elsewhere in the sale, the shirt worn by Bobby Moore in his last match in England, between Fulham and Blackburn in May 14, 1977, went for \u00a33,600. The 1970 FA Cup winner's medal awarded to the then Chelsea captain Ron Harris fetched \u00a313,200 but Rivelino's shirt from the 1970 Brazil v Italy World Cup final failed to sell after it was expected to fetch \u00a335,000. paul.kelso@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
