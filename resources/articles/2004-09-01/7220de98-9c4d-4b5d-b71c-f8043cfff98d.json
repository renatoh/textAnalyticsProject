Two goals in the first 10 minutes from the Sierra Leone striker Mohammed Kallon and the on-loan Barcelona forward Javier Saviola secured a 2-0 win over Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a which left the Spanish side bottom of Group A. \"You can't compare the two matches as it was two different teams and my feeling is that we suffered a lot physically during the second half tonight,\" said Deschamps. Bayer Leverkusen, Real Madrid's conquerors two weeks ago, were brought down to earth in Ukraine where Dynamo Kiev won a topsy-turvy game 4-2 and moved to the top of Group B. Second-half goals from Andrej Voronin and Jens Nowotny for Leverkusen overhauled Diogo Rinc\u00f3n's 30th-minute opener. A second goal from Rinc\u00f3n and two for Florin Cernat turned the game round again. Leverkusen's Voronin was sent off in the 83rd minute. Bayern Munich thrashed Ajax 4-0 to stay top of Group C. The Dutch striker Roy Makaay completed his hat-trick with a 52nd-minute penalty and the Brazilian Ze Roberto added a fourth. Also in Group C a first-half header from the Argentinian Mauro Camoranesi gave Juventus a 1-0 win over Maccabi Tel Aviv, putting the Italians level with Bayern. Camoranesi powerfully headed home a Pavel Nedved corner in the 37th minute to win a disappointing match played before a poor crowd. A Sylvain Wiltord goal gave Lyon a 2-1 win away to Sparta Prague. Mickael Essien had equalled Tomas Jun's opener before the former Arsenal striker beat the offside trap and dribbled round the keeper in the 58th minute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
