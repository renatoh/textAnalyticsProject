The centre-half earned his 17th cap in Sunday\u2019s goalless draw against the Republic of Ireland, starting alongside Gary Cahill, and will compete with Phil Jagielka for a place in Roy Hodgson\u2019s lineup against Slovenia in Sunday\u2019s Euro 2016 qualifier in Ljubljana. The 25-year-old recognised an opportunity had presented itself at club level following the departures of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand last summer, and his form duly earned him the armband in the absence of Wayne Rooney and, in April, a new four-year contract. Louis van Gaal suggested the defender\u2019s game had developed significantly over the course of the season, with Smalling confident he and his club-mate Phil Jones have made a positive impression. \u201cI think it was make or break considering the outgoings at centre-back last summer,\u201d said the former Fulham player. \u201cIt was a chance where players had to step in and, luckily, I\u2019ve been one of those who has had a good run, especially in the second half of the season. Apart from the start of the season, when I had a few injuries, I\u2019ve been able to have a good run and the manager has shown faith in me at United. \u201cWe take more risks at United than the majority of teams but the manager wants us to play. That is something we have fully taken on board, because that is his style, and I think that has helped me when playing in the games. On the back of that, it was nice to get another England game [in the Republic of Ireland] to carry on the season. Now it is all about building on that next season.\u201d That appearance in Dublin was only Smalling\u2019s fourth in England\u2019s nine games since last summer\u2019s World Cup finals and his second start in succession after the friendly draw in Italy during March. Although Hodgson has often turned back to his most experienced centre-half pairing of Cahill and Jagielka in more awkward contests, there is a recognition that younger combinations must be introduced. Smalling is effectively competing with Jones and the highly regarded John Stones, currently with the Under-21s for the summer\u2019s European Championship, for a regular place. The game in Slovenia represents another timely opportunity for Smalling to stake a long-term claim for a centre-half position. Hodgson will seek a much-improved performance from his team against their nearest challengers in Group E after the anaemic offering in Dublin, but an 11th match without defeat \u2013 the run started with a 0-0 draw against Costa Rica at the World Cup \u2013 is their objective. \u201cWe\u2019re unbeaten since Brazil and in that run we\u2019ve had some very good performances, a lot of them better than in Dublin,\u201d said Smalling. \u201cThe fact we\u2019re still unbeaten has bred confidence. We could have done a lot better against the Republic of Ireland but we kept a clean sheet and we\u2019ll try and take some positives from it. We probably needed that game given the time we\u2019d all had off. \u201cWe have a job to do on Sunday. It is one of those where we know if we do the job it [qualification] is near enough there and we can go into the summer relieved and happy. Whereas if we don\u2019t win this game it is a long break [with the job still to be finished] so I don\u2019t think there will be any problems with people getting up for it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
