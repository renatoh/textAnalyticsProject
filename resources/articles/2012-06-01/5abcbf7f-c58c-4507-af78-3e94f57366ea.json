Masaaki Suzuki has selected cantata arias, organ chorales and sinfonias (all from previous recordings) in a sensitive programme that ranges from the fearful to the ecstatic, all aimed at bringing comfort and strength to the bereaved, culminating in a peerlessly sung performance of the motet Komm, Jesu, Komm - that great universal statement of love and compassion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
