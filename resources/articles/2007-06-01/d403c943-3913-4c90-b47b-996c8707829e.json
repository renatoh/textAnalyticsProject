She also said there would be no point in going ahead with an inter-governmental conference after the EU summit in Brussels tomorrow and on Friday unless there was an agreed, detailed mandate for setting out the framework of what will be discussed. Arguing that failure would not represent a major setback, she said that in recent months the EU had continued to work, pointing to decisions on roaming charges for mobile phones. \"I don't dispute if we could tidy up the rule book if you like, the EU could be able to work more efficiently and effectively, but it has not ground to a halt so far, and I think it is not the case that it automatically would.\" She said some EU states were in denial about the fact that there would be no European constitution to match that rejected by the French in 2005. Her remarks to the foreign affairs select committee ran counter to a warning yesterday by Jose Barroso, the European commission president, that Europe would be seriously damaged unless it reached agreements that made an enlarged Europe work more efficiently. Mr Barroso said it was becoming \"absurd\" that it could take the EU as long as six years to implement a policy agreement, and an \"\u00e0 la carte\" Europe with \"exceptions and exemptions\" for various member states was simply not possible. \"Europe's credibility is at stake. We have to give the EU the capacity to act in the 21st century. If at the end of the negotiations we have a Europe \u00e0 la carte where every member state chooses what it does and does not want we are putting in danger the very idea of a union. We need the capacity to act collectively. This is the limit of what we [the commission] can accept.\" The tone of Mrs Beckett's remarks suggests Britain is addressing problems ahead of the summit, and may be prepared to see a failure to agree rather than accept a series of treaty amendments that will lead to pressure on Gordon Brown to concede the referendum being demanded by the Conservatives. Mr Brown, who takes over as prime minister next Wednesday, will not attend the summit, which will be attended by Mr Blair and Ms Beckett. But Mr Brown and Mr Blair held a telephone conference yesterday with Nicolas Sarkozy, the new French president, to see if they could agree a common negotiating strategy. Germany, currently president of the EU, is due to put a more detailed proposal to the 27 member countries today. Mr Brown, speaking on GMTV, said he was optimistic an agreement could be reached. But he told GMTV that if necessary he would be prepared to hold a referendum on changes to the way the EU was run. Mrs Beckett told the select committee: \"The prime minister has made it very clear what our red lines are, and that we would not agree to breach those red lines, and we believe those red lines would be below the threshold for a referendum.\" She added: \"We are adamant that what is required is an amending treaty...very different from the overall EU constitution.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
