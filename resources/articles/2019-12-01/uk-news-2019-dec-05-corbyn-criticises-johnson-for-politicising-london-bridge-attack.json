The Labour leader, who revealed he spoke to Merritt\u2019s father, Dave, in the days after the student was killed, criticised Johnson for making a glut of statements about strengthening the law in the immediate aftermath of the atrocity. Corbyn told the Guardian: \u201cI deliberately tried not to politicise it. I simply said I think there are questions to answer about the way our prison service operates. The underfunding of the prison service, the role of the parole board and the role of the probation service. \u201cI think it\u2019s right to ask those questions but not to leap to immediate conclusions. I think he did it far too much.\u201d Asked if Johnson politicised the Cambridge graduate\u2019s death, he said: \u201cI think he made too many statements too quickly about it all and I think it\u2019s important to take stock of the situation. \u201cObviously the first priority is to make sure everybody is safe of course.\u201d Corbyn said the killings of Merritt and colleague Saskia Jones by convicted terrorist Usman Khan was the lowest point of the general election campaign. He spoke to the Guardian on the campaign trail before a rally in Birmingham, with the Tories ahead in the polls just a week before the election. At the same time, his interview with ITV\u2019s Julie Etchingham aired, in which Corbyn was pressed on whether he would return convicted terrorists on early release to jail. \u201cI think you have to investigate every case in which people have been given early release and you have to investigate all the circumstances surrounding the release of this particular individual and you have to also abide by the laws as well \u2026 It means looking at each case given early release and if there\u2019s any cause for concern you recall them,\u201d he said. The Labour leader again apologised to those hurt by delays dealing with complaints about antisemitism. \u201cAntisemitism is a vile evil in our society. I am not a racist in any form. I\u2019ve spent my life opposing racism. And I think the treatment of Jewish people that suffer from antisemitism is appalling. And where there\u2019s been delays, by my party, in instituting a process, of course I apologise to those that suffered as a result of it,\u201d he said. In lighter parts of the interview, he was asked \u201cthe most romantic \u2026 wild and reckless\u201d moment of his life, replying that he had enjoyed some \u201cwonderful holidays\u201d with his wife, Laura \u00c1lvarez. Corbyn blamed his trailing personal poll ratings on \u201cattacks in the media\u201d, although he said he did not comment on opinion surveys. On Thursday night, Labour escalated its ongoing complaint about BBC bias to the broadcaster\u2019s director-general, Tony Hall. The party is unhappy about anti-Labour framing and the decision to allow the Conservative leader to \u201cpick and choose\u201d his BBC platform. Andrew Gwynne, Labour\u2019s co-campaign coordinator, raised the case of Boris Johnson\u2019s failure to be interviewed by Andrew Neil despite the BBC giving the Labour party a \u201cclear understanding that Boris Johnson had agreed the same terms\u201d. Johnson also dodged a similar interview with ITV\u2019s Etchingham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
