Talks postponed from last month are expected to start within days and Mercedes want Hamilton, whose three-year deal runs out at the end of next season, to stay well beyond 2016. \u201cWe want Lewis to stay for many more years,\u201d said the team\u2019s motorsport director, Toto Wolff, on Monday, as he appeared at a press conference with Hamilton, who had been ready to discuss his future earlier but was advised to wait until after Sunday\u2019s race. His team-mate, Nico Rosberg, signed a long-term deal in July and Mercedes want Hamilton to do the same. Hamilton, currently paid about \u00a319m a year, will negotiate himself, with help, after letting his contract with the agent XIX Entertainment lapse. He said on Monday: \u201cWe haven\u2019t discussed the nuances but someone mentioned it\u2019s pretty much a formality. I haven\u2019t made any decisions on how you go about it. Ultimately, driving is what I do best. I\u2019m not a businessman, I\u2019m not a contract negotiator. So nothing is really decided on how the meeting will go. \u201cThe contract I currently have is a great contract. I\u2019m going to take some time to try and understand how I can help the team more, and how the team can get more, and how the team can utilise me more. Because I\u2019ve got a lot of followers. Ultimately I think not a huge amount will change.\u201d Jenson Button may still have weeks to wait before being told whether McLaren want him for next season, however. A board meeting in early December is likely to decide whether Button or his team-mate, Kevin Magnussen, will partner the new signing Fernando Alonso next year. McLaren\u2019s executive chairman, Ron Dennis, said on Monday: \u201cThat\u2019s where it will be discussed. I\u2019ve not made up my mind yet, but it\u2019s not mine alone, and anyway, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate. Any decision has to be supported by the shareholders and the board. It\u2019s pretty understandable we\u2019re looking at two people, and there\u2019s a broader choice than Kevin and Jenson, but nevertheless whatever the decision, it won\u2019t be taken until the board meeting.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
