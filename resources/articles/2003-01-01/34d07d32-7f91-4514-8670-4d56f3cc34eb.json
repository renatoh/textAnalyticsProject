In recent years her influence has been so strong the BBC has had to send lists to the food industry warning which products will appear in Smith's shows. The Collins English Dictionary even lists the phenomenon under \"Delia power\". Cranberries Sales rose by 200% after Smith included them in a duck recipe in 1995, awakening the nation to the fact that cranberries were not just for Christmas. Prunes Just one mention by Smith of the word \"prune\" on her television series How to Cook (she was making \"the perfect sticky prune and date cake\") was enough to send shoppers running to the stores to stock up on a product abandoned by the post-war generation. Omelette pans Orders for the Lune Metal pan made by a tiny Lancashire firm leaped from 200 a year to 90,000 in four months after Smith described it as a \"little gem\". Eggs Shops were selling an extra 1.3 million eggs a day thanks to Smith's How to Cook, in which she showed viewers how to beat, scramble, poach and boil them. Sea salt Essex-based Maldon Crystal Salt Flakes was thrown into disarray when Delia included its seasoning in her list of \"must haves\". The company had a workforce of just 10 people, manufacturing 400 tons of the hand-panned salt every year. Stock cubes Smith's insistence on using Marigold Swiss bouillon in her recipes on How to Cook 2 sparked a run on the vegetable stock cubes and supermarket chains rushed to buy the obscure brand. Sunblush tomatoes Middle England dropped sundried tomatoes as soon as Smith recommended Normandy sunblush tomatoes. Carrs bread flour The 170-year-old company experienced a remarkable 500% rise in sales of the mix recommended in Smith's How to Cook: Book Three and featured on the BBC2 series. Skewers Sales of the kitchen implement soared 35% after Smith told viewers they were essential for checking whether a cake is baked. Books Last but not least, the Delia effect helped her books sell in their millions and Smith is rarely out of the bestseller lists. The Complete Cookery Course is one of the best selling books of all time and her latest, Delia's Vegetarian Collection, was in the top five food and drink book list all last year despite having no TV show to promote it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
