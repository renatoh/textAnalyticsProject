Its follow-up, 2009\u2019s Everything Is New, recalibrated the Londoner\u2019s profile to that of a more serious, refined dance-pop artist. Following that record\u2019s acclaim, Pe\u00f1ate took a step back from the limelight, and has spent the past decade learning how to produce music himself. Indeed, his return on After You showcases Pe\u00f1ate\u2019s own high-end production values (with some help from Paul Epworth, Inflo and Alex Epton). This isn\u2019t a release that bows to zeitgeisty sounds, but instead aims, in somewhat hit-and miss-fashion, at timeless songwriting. The sprawling cosmic delicacy of Loaded Gun feels reminiscent of Bowie; the Beatles are referenced at their most spiritual via slightly eye-roll-inducing sitar on the otherwise sweet Cipralex. Amid melancholy introspection are propulsive splashes of gospel, glossy strings and sax, plush,airy keys and intricate percussion nodding to jungle and acid house; and a reading of a poem by Mervyn Peake \u2013 Pe\u00f1ate\u2019s grandfather \u2013 over beautifully ornate piano on Gemini. Broadly speaking, After You succeeds as a rich, expansive set of sophisticated classic pop \u2013 but, unlike Pe\u00f1ate\u2019s early work, it feels somewhat irrelevant to 2019."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
