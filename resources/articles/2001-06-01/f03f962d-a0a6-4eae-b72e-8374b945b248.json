While a rate hold means both savers and homeowners are unlikely to see any change to their savings accounts and mortgages, this in itself will be welcomed by savers who are desperately trying to claw back some kind of a return on their money. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has made three rate cuts this year already, from 6% in January to 5.25% last month. The series of cuts has meant that banks and building societies have slashed the interest being paid on savings accounts - in some case by substantially more than the rate cut. As a result, savings rates are at an all-time low, with top rates barely hitting the 6% mark. While a decision not to cut rates further rate is good news for savers at the moment, it could come as a poisoned chalice. The hold on rates might mean an end to a series of rate movements, with the possibility of the base rate remaining at this level for some time. At the end of last year, after a long period of an unchanged base rate, some banks and building societies took the unusual decision to start cutting rates on their accounts anyway. So, if rates do stay on hold for too long, savers may suffer anyway. Analysts remain less confident as to whether further rate cuts will happen later in the year than they were about today's decision. However, many are expecting there will be a further cut of a quarter per cent later in the year. Such decisions will depend largely on developments in the global economy, and particularly in the US. Naturally, another rate cut will mean more good news for borrowers - and further frustration for savers. According to Moneyfacts, savers with smaller institutions often tend to do better when rate cuts are made. Smaller banks and building societies often make cuts across the board in line with the Bank of England cut, rather than cutting rates on a tiered basis, which is what many of the larger institutions do. Which accounts suffer most when these tiered rates are decided seems to be a bit of a lottery. The only savers who might be disappointed by today's news are the customers of institutions who didn't react to the last cut. Some smaller building societies may have decided to wait until this announcement, to save money on the cost of printing literature advertising new rates twice in a row."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
