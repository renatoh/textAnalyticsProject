John Anthony Cole, 54, resigned from The Grange School, in Shrewsbury, at the end of last April after allegations of misconduct were made the previous year. Today, he appeared before a General Teaching Council conduct panel in Birmingham, the first to sit since responsibility for regulating teachers passed to the new body last year. The panel heard the presenting officer, Margaret Bromley, set out the allegations against Mr Cole. Allegations relating to his activities in the classroom included the use of inappropriate language. It was said he used the words \"bastard\" and \"shit\" in maths and RE lessons, Ms Bromley told the hearing. She said: \"Clearly, pupils on occasion misbehave, perhaps on a frequent basis and there will be some occasions when pupils have to be sent out of the classroom. \"What isn't appropriate in my submission is to accompany that with phrases such as 'get out, we don't want to see your stupid face in the classroom'. \"The use of these words was not an isolated incident but was something that happened on several occasions in both maths and RE lessons.\". The GTC was set up to promote and regulate the teaching profession. Registration is compulsory for state schoolteachers, and they can be struck off for professional misconduct. A GTC conduct committee, which consists of a panel of three - two teachers and one lay-member - can decide to dismiss the allegations, to issue a reprimand or attach \"conditions\" to the registration a teacher needs to work in English state schools. Ultimately, it can remove a teacher from the register altogether if members feel the misconduct is serious enough. If disciplined, the teacher has 28 days to appeal to the High Court. Statements taken from the pupils in question were backed up by a pupil in Year 10 who was considered reliable. Statements had been taken separately to avoid \"collusion\", Ms Bromley told the hearing. Other allegations concerned the application process for the government's \u00a32,000 performance-related pay bonuses, which thousands of teachers were encouraged to apply for during the summer of 2000. The panel heard allegations that Mr Cole told other teachers at the school they had no chance of getting the bonus in a \"deliberate attempt\" to undermine the school's headteacher, John Stokes. Mr Cole was also accused for passing a memo to a member of the team during an Ofsted inspection. In it, he complained about \"badly managed change\" at the school and of being \"persecuted\" by a particular colleague. Mr Cole replied he put correspondence between him and Mr Stokes before Ofsted inspectors so that there could \"be a discussion about stress\". The fourth allegation against Mr Cole concerned a breach of GCSE rules by the maths head in summer 2000. Ms Bromley said Mr Cole had copied a letter he wrote to the headteacher in September to exam board Edexcel about the fact the head of maths had retained their papers for longer than the rules allowed. But the headteacher had himself informed the board of the breach the day after it came to light. The fact that Mr Cole only raised the issue in September \"provides support for the view that his motive was causing trouble for his head of department and headteacher, not concern for pupils,\" said Ms Bromley. Mr Cole said he had a history of \"stress-related illness\" before he joined the school in 1991. The committee agreed to adjourn proceedings to a date in March after Mr Cole told the panel: \"I have had enough. I am going to get to the point where I cannot cope. I cannot deal with it anymore.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
