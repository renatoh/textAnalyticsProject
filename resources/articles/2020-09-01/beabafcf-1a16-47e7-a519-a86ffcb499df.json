Stepping on to the training pitch at England\u2019s training base at St George\u2019s Park on Friday evening, Kirby stole the show in an intra-squad friendly, having made a successful return from debilitating pericarditis, a swelling of the fluid-filled sac around her heart. \u201cSeeing Fran Kirby in an England shirt was unbelievable,\u201d said Neville. \u201cSix to eight months ago I thought that was a long way away, but the work that she has put in herself, the work she has done to get mentally and physically right to play at the level she\u2019s playing this season is an incredible achievement, exciting.\u201d Kirby also starred in Chelsea\u2019s 9-0 thrashing of Bristol City last week, and Emma Hayes has described her form since returning as \u201cunbelievable\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d said a typically modest Kirby of her Chelsea manager\u2019s comments. \u201cI am at a really good level. I think I am probably the fittest I\u2019ve been for a long, long time just purely because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve worked really hard on for the last three or four months. I think there is still another level I can go to. I think I can be more clinical in my finishing, I can improve, but when you hear a manager say something like that it is really special.\u201d Hayes said the 27-year-old is someone she \u201ccares about immensely\u201d. She is not alone in that sentiment. Since the forward\u2019s return, showing the pace and touch that many thought she may lose after such an injury-ridden year, there has been an outpouring of affection towards the player once nicknamed England\u2019s \u201cmini-Messi\u201d by the former national-team manager Mark Sampson. After Kirby was named player of the match in the training game, Neville enthused: \u201cThe best thing is the smile on her face. She\u2019s falling in love with football again, she wants to play football. She\u2019s playing like that kid that used to play in the park.\u201d \u201cYou see it,\u201d said Kirby, who had a love-hate relationship with social media as she privately grappled with her illness, at one stage taking a step back entirely. \u201cNo support has gone unnoticed, reading everyone\u2019s comments about me being back and all the positives I\u2019ve had. But I need to keep working, I need to keep producing the performances. \u201cThat\u2019s the journey I\u2019m on, I want to keep progressing on that, but it\u2019s been incredible to hear people staying so many positive things about you, not just as a player but as a person. I\u2019ve come back energised, I\u2019ve come back smiling. I\u2019m enjoying it. That means more to me, how people see you as a person.\u201d For Chelsea the return of Kirby could be more significant than any signing they have made, including the Danish forward Pernille Harder for a world record fee. Meanwhile, England have their chief creator back. \u201cShe\u2019s a world-class player,\u201d said Neville. \u201cShe\u2019s the difference for us when we want to get to a certain level.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
