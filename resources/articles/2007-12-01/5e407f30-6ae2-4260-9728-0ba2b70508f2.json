The Japanese vessel, en route from Batavia (now Jakarta) to Singapore, was carrying 1,600 troops and was the largest Japanese warship sunk by a Royal Navy vessel. The attack, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Arthur Hezlet, who has died aged 93, is still taught at naval colleges as one of the classic submarine actions of that war. During the course of the engagement, the submarine was twice attacked by a Japanese destroyer, the Kamikaze. Hezlet was born into a Northern Irish army family in Pretoria, South Africa, where his father was serving. He was educated at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, and then served on the battleships Royal Oak and Resolution and the cruiser Devonshire. During the Abyssinian crisis in 1935, he served on the minesweeper HMS Huntley in Malta before being compulsorily transferred to submarines. His first boat was HMS Regulus, engaged on anti-piracy patrols on the China station. He then served on HMS H43 before becoming first lieutenant of the new T-class boat, HMS Trident. He successfully completed his \"perishers\" course in 1940, designed to teach lieutenant commanders how to take sole command of a submarine, and took charge of HMS H44 before being posted to Malta in 1941 with the 10th Flotilla. Skippering HMS Unique, he sank the 11,400-ton Italian troop ship Esperia. After getting in among the escorts, he attacked from 600 yards and escaped by inadvertently entering an Italian minefield of which the escorts were aware and dared not follow. Later that day, Unique was attacked by a flying boat, causing an oil leak that necessitated an immediate return to Malta. He was greeted warmly on his arrival because the two other submarines sent out at the same time as Unique had both been sunk. He was awarded the DSC. Hezlet was then given command of HMS Ursula, in which he attacked an enemy convoy and damaged the 4,858-ton supply ship Beppe. Ursula even managed to get involved in a battle with an armoured car while the submarine's gun crew were engaged in shelling a coastal road bridge on the Italian mainland. Hezlet brought Ursula back to Britain and was given command of his old boat, Trident, engaged in operations around the convoys to northern Russia. He sank the 5,386-ton German ore carrier Hoedur. Trident then escorted Convoy PQ16 to Murmansk, a journey that saw almost constant action, and picked up survivors from sunken merchantmen. Hezlet then became a training officer for midget submarines in preparation for the attack on the German battleship Tirpitz in the Altenfjord, Norway, in 1943. He wrote the training programme and had a major say in who was chosen for the eventual attack, which put the battleship out of action for months. Then, after taking command of HMS Thrasher, he towed the midget submarine X-5 across the North Sea for the attack itself. Hezlet and his crew then transferred to Trenchant and took the vessel to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) for a series of long patrols, during which they sank numerous small craft. He was ordered to patrol off Penang on the morning of September 23 1944. He then sighted the German U-boat 859 on the surface as she prepared to rendezvous with a Japanese escort to take her into harbour. U-859 had sailed from Germany with ballast consisting of mercury, which the Japanese needed urgently for their war industries. Hezlet sank her with a single torpedo amidships. Minutes later, he noticed yellow lifejackets bobbing to the surface as survivors escaped from the wreck some 50 metres below. He surfaced and rescued 11 before the appearance of the Japanese escort necessitated a hasty withdrawal. He was awarded the DSO. After sinking the Ashigara he was awarded the American Legion of Merit and a bar to his DSO. He returned to Britain days before the Japanese surrender as one of only a score of men who had served throughout the war on submarines. At the end of 1946 he was selected to be the second in command of the British observers to the US atom bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. In 1949 he was given command of the destroyer HMS Scorpion before promotion and a return to the admiralty. After staff college in 1955, he became Captain \"D\" of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla, serving on HMS Battleaxe. Hezlet was then appointed director of the Royal Naval Staff College at Greenwich, followed by a posting to Singapore to command the cruiser HMS Newfoundland. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1959 as flag officer submarines at a time when the Royal Navy still had some 40 submarines and its first nuclear-powered boat, HMS Dreadnought was being built. Knighted in 1964, his final posting was as flag officer Scotland and Northern Ireland as vice admiral. Hezlet then returned to Northern Ireland, where he had inherited the family seat, Boveagh House, Aghadowey, County Londonderry. In retirement he led a busy life, serving for 25 years with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the Royal British Legion. He served on the general synod of the Church of Ireland and was an original council member of the University of Ulster. His publications included The Submarine and Sea Power (1967), Aircraft and Sea Power (1970), The \"B\" Specials: a history of the Ulster Special Constabulary (1972), Electron and Seapower (1975), The Trenchant at War (2001) and British and Allied Submarine Operations in World War II, completed in 2002 shortly before strokes prevented further work. He is survived by his wife Patricia and two adopted daughters. \u00b7 Vice Admiral Sir Arthur Richard Hezlet, submariner, born April 7 1914; died November 7 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
