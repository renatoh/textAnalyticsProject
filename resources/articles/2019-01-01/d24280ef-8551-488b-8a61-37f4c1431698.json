Lawyers for the man said his claim was lodged with the Fair Work Commission this week, three weeks after he was sacked. \u201cWe say the decision is unfair for a raft of reasons, not least of which is blaming the worker for the accident when there were significant issues with the systems over which he had no control,\u201d Timothy Kucera said. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic case of blaming the worker, not the system.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The fully laden train was deliberately derailed about 120km out of Port Hedland by BHP\u2019s remote control centre in Perth on 5 November, destroying 1.5km of track and costing the company an estimated $55m a day until the track was repaired. It had travelled for 92km without a driver after the driver stepped off the train to check one of the carriages and, BHP alleges, failed to properly engage the emergency brake for the entire train. BHP\u2019s Western Australian iron ore asset president, Edgar Basto, said in November that the driver had left the train to disconnect a braking system control cable, which had caused the train to stop. \u201cOur initial findings show that the emergency air brake for the entire train was not engaged as required by the relevant operating procedure,\u201d Basto told Australian Mining magazine. \u201cIn addition, the electric braking system that initially stopped the train automatically released after one hour while the driver was still outside. Due to integration failure of the backup braking system, it was not able to deploy successfully.\u201d BHP confirmed the driver no longer worked for the company and said it could not comment on the unfair dismissal case \u201cout of respect for the individual and their privacy\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
