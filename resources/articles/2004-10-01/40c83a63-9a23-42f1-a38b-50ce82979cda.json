They are part of a 16-man field chasing the biggest first prize in golf, \u00a31m. Singh, the 1997 winner of this event, is in the form of his life after winning eight times on the 2004 PGA Tour, whereas Langer has not played since guiding Europe to a record 18-9 win over the United States at Oakland Hills last month. Ernie Els, the holder and top seed, will take on Scott Drummond in the first round with the knowledge that the British player's previous appearance on the West Course ended with the biggest win of his career when he claimed the Volvo PGA Championship in May. In addition to Singh, there are two other major winners from the year with the Open champion Todd Hamilton taking on Lee Westwood and Retief Goosen, winner of the US Open, playing Jeff Maggert. The first-round draw, made yesterday, also pitches Ireland's Padraig Harrington against his US Ryder Cup rival Chris Riley. Meanwhile the Dunhill Links champion Stephen Gallacher has admitted that a huge weight has been lifted from his shoulders after his maiden victory in a European Tour event at St Andrews on Sunday. The 29-year-old from Bathgate said: \"I have been knocking on the door for some time. Everybody kept telling me that that I was good enough but doing it and saying it are two different things.\" First-round draw: Ernie Els (SA) v Scott Drummond (GB), KJ Choi (S Kor) v Angel Cabrera (Arg), Padraig Harrington (Ire) v Chris Riley (US), Mike Weir (Can) v Thomas Levet (Fr), Retief Goosen (SA) v Jeff Maggert (US), Todd Hamilton (US) v Lee Westwood (GB), Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez (Sp) v Steve Flesch (US), Vijay Singh (Fiji) v Bernhard Langer (Ger)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
