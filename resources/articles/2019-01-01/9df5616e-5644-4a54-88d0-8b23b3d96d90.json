A measure backed by the president, including $5.7bn to help build a wall on the US-Mexico border, had a vote count of 50-47 in the Senate \u2013 well short of the 60 required to advance it over a Democratic filibuster. The widely predicted twin failure deepened the sense of dysfunctional government and left Washington with no obvious path out of the longest shutdown in US history. Some 800,000 federal workers are set to miss another pay cheque on Friday. At the White House, Trump sought to put a positive spin on the votes, insisting during some rambling remarks that \u201cwe won 50-47\u201d. He was asked by reporters whether he would support any agreement reached by Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and minority leader Chuck Schumer. \u201cWell, it depends what the agreement is,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, yeah - but if they come to a reasonable agreement, I would support it.\u201d Pressed on whether it has to have money for his border wall, Trump insisted: \u201cI have other alternatives, if I have to. And I\u2019ll use those alternatives if I have to. But we want to go through the system. We have to have a wall in this country. We have criminals pouring into our country. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not talking about the southern border. They don\u2019t stay there. They go through and they permeate all throughout the country, including places like Wisconsin - a lot of different places. And that\u2019s the problem.\u201d Democrats condemned the outcome but noted that six Republicans defied the president on their proposal. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said: \u201cI\u2019m encouraged that some Senate Republicans are beginning to join Democrats to back a sensible resolution to this mess. They understand that the number one priority is ending this hostage crisis. With the government open, we can consider responsible ways to boost border security. It\u2019s time to end this nonsense now.\u201d The $350bn-plus funding bill represented the first attempt by Republicans controlling the Senate to reopen the government since the partial shutdown began a record 34 days ago. It would have provided three years of continued protection against deportation for 700,000 immigrants brought to the US illegally as children. Then Democratic-backed clean funding bill would have reopened the government for two weeks without money for a border wall, but also fell short of the 60-vote threshold. The Senate voted 52-44, more support than for Trump\u2019s proposal. Six Republicans voted for the measure including senators Johnny Isakson, Mitt Romney, Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Cory Gardner. Romney told reporters: \u201cI believe a border security programme should include, as well, a barrier on our souther border. I want to see government get open and government workers get paid. It\u2019s having an effect on our economy and it\u2019s having an effect on the lives of workers.\u201d The Utah senator and former presidential nominee called for further negotiations. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have the leaders of both parties, including the Democratic party, sit down with the president and work out a deal that includes border security and gets the government open.\u201d Earlier, the House of Representative passed the latest in a series of measures aimed at reopening the government with a 231-180 vote to open the Homeland Security Department. It was the 11th attempt to pass a bill ending the shutdown. About 20 House Democrats marched over to the Senate during its vote in an attempt to pressure Republicans. At a press conference, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said she was willing to meet Trump \u201cany time\u201d to discuss ending the partial shutdown. She said House Democrats are putting together a new border security package that will include money for fencing, technology, personnel and other measures, but not Trump\u2019s long-promised wall. Apparently watching on TV, the president quickly responded on Twitter: \u201cNancy just said she \u2018just doesn\u2019t understand why?\u2019 Very simply, without a Wall it all doesn\u2019t work. Our Country has a chance to greatly reduce Crime, Human Trafficking, Gangs and Drugs. Should have been done for decades. We will not Cave!\u201d Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, scheduled for Tuesday, has been postponed until the end of the shutdown following an acrimonious tit-for-tat with Pelosi. Trump and his allies have been accused of a callous disregard for federal workers\u2019 plight. Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, told CNBC that he did not understand why some are using food banks when they could take out loans. \u201cThe obligations that they would undertake \u2013 say borrowing from a bank or credit union \u2013 are in effect federally guaranteed,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the 30 days of pay that people will be out \u2014 there\u2019s no real reason why they shouldn\u2019t be able to get a loan against it, and we\u2019ve seen a number of ads from the financial institutions doing that.\u201d Pelosi told reporters: \u201cIs this a \u2018let them eat cake\u2019 kind of attitude, or call your father for money?\u201d Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, added on Twitter: \u201cWilbur Ross is @realDonaldTrump\u2019s Secretary of Commerce. Wilbur Ross is a billionaire. And this is billionaire Wilbur Ross saying he doesn\u2019t understand why federal workers not getting paid during the #TrumpShutdown don\u2019t just take out loans *to feed their families*. Unreal.\u201d In an eye-catching move, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, John Kelly, joined the four other former homeland security secretaries in signing a letter urging the president and his Democratic rivals to end the shutdown. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association has warned of a growing threat to aviation safety. On Wednesday a poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that just 34% of Americans like Trump\u2019s performance as president and six in 10 assign a great deal of responsibility to him for the shutdown, about double the share blaming Democrats."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
