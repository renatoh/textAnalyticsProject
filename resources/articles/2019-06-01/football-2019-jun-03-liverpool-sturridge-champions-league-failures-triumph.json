The Liverpool striker, who will leave as a free agent this summer, has witnessed several cup final defeats and Premier League title near-misses during six and a half years at Anfield. He admits the experiences have left a lasting pain but also helped Liverpool to prepare for Saturday\u2019s final and maintain composure when put under pressure by Tottenham. The 2016 Europa League final, when Liverpool led Sevilla 1-0 at half-time thanks to Sturridge but lost 3-1, was mentioned during the interval on Saturday before J\u00fcrgen Klopp secured the first trophy of his Anfield reign. Sturridge said: \u201cThe heartache never goes away \u2013 you always think about it. People were saying: \u2018If we win we won\u2019t think about it,\u2019 but you do. You always think: \u2018What if?\u2019 All the things when you lost, you take them into a game because you\u2019ve learnt from them: all the pain, all the heartache you had prior to that. \u201cAnd when you come into a game like this final, you go: \u2018OK, cool.\u2019 You come in at half-time and you talk different. You\u2019re like: \u2018OK, remember what happened last time guys. Let\u2019s do this.\u2019 When we got in at half-time everyone started speaking about how they felt we needed to improve for the second half. In the Europa League we were 1-0 up and we lost 3-1. \u201cWe had a long talk as a group of players on Wednesday. We said: \u2018If we go one up how do we play? If we go one down how do we play?\u2019 It\u2019s about being prepared for everything. That was important, just the players hashing it out. We haven\u2019t had those conversations before. I feel like maybe before the Europa League final we didn\u2019t prepare as well. We\u2019d had two [European finals] before this year so we have learned much more. \u201cWhen you lose you think about anything and everything you could have done right and what you did wrong. You learn from that and that\u2019s what we did on Saturday.\u201d Sturridge has two Champions League winner\u2019s medals despite being an unused substitute against Spurs and in the 2012 final for Chelsea against Bayern Munich. He explained why they are deserved. \u201cI contributed and even the players who haven\u2019t played a minute,\u201d said the striker, who made seven Champions League appearances this season and scored in the group win against Paris Saint-Germain. \u201cThere are guys who have been on the bench and haven\u2019t played a single minute but have been a part of it: from training, to acting like the opposition that we have been playing against, to doing a job, to sacrificing themselves and the way they play just to do a job on the training field.\u201d The 29-year-old declined to discuss his future because he did not want to take attention from Liverpool\u2019s sixth European Cup triumph. He said: \u201cWhat\u2019s important now is celebrating something so momentous and something we were striving and working for for a long time.\u201d The victory means Liverpool will play in the Club World Cup in Qatar in December. Joe Gomez, meanwhile, believes the possibilities for Liverpool are unlimited because victory in the Champions League demonstrates to every big-name player that Anfield under Klopp is the place to be. He said: \u201cThat\u2019s what we all know. We are here together to stay and I think the boundaries are limitless. We have a foundation which will stay and only get stronger so all our belief in what we can do is at an all-time high.\u201d Gomez\u2019s substitute appearance in the final marked a fitting end to a season in which the 22-year-old excelled before breaking a leg at Burnley in December. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve had some tough times and it\u2019s a battle to come back from it but I\u2019ve never doubted myself and I never will.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
