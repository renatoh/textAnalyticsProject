As managers of lesser teams often moan, the Premiership has now sub-divided into a series of mini-leagues; Graeme Souness recently admitted that teams like Blackburn may never win the Premiership again. So for the top tier, anything below fourth place and failure to qualify for the Champions League is akin to relegation. With the knock-on effects of a \u00a320m-plus windfall at stake, Liverpool and Chelsea meet on Sunday in what will potentially be the most lucrative 90 minutes of league football ever played. Year after year, a club's entire season can rest on the final day's performance, but for either Liverpool or Chelsea, the effects of losing on Sunday will be felt for a long time to come. The costs of keeping up with the Joneses, the Joses and the Guilios of European football rise with every season, and the gulf only widens if you have to make do with the lean pickings the Uefa Cup affords. Yes, it's an easier Cup to win, as Liverpool know. But, with its knock-out format, it's also easy to crash out embarrassingly early, as Chelsea have come to realise. What's more, the Uefa Cup is a less-attractive, lower-profile competition. The opening six-game phase of the Champions League this year was worth \u00a35.5m to each team involved, with further earnings of \u00a3250,000 for a win and \u00a3125,000 for a draw, plus gate receipts. That's not including a share of the \u00a3249m TV money pool. Teams involved in the Uefa Cup receive comparatively little - around \u00a340,000 each until the third round, after which there is no prize money until the final where the winners will pick up around \u00a32.4m and the losers \u00a31.7m. And they have to negotiate their own TV deals. \"Being in the Champions League is worth about \u00a315m a year - and that's a substantial amount by anyone's reckoning,\" said Liverpool's chief executive Rick Parry this week. \"I accept that a good run in the Uefa Cup can be valuable, but there is a gap between the two. The Champions League is our aim and is where we need to be.\" It's also where the top stars need to be. World-class players are only interested in signing for, or staying at, clubs who can promise them Champions League football. Who wants to be playing in Siberia when the San Siro beckons instead? Even wise and frugal operators like Arsenal can easily over-stretch themselves trying to match the monetary might of Manchester United. Investing \u00a3400m in their future, Arsenal have mortgaged their present, recording losses of \u00a343m this season, thus hamstringing their ability to bring in new players over the summer in order to compete with United on the pitch. Arsenal had budgeted on reaching the quarter-finals this year. After the defeat against Valencia which knocked them out, Highbury chairman Peter Hill-Wood admitted: \"It hurt us financially and affected our cash flow. I believe that failing to reach the quarter-finals cost Arsenal \u00a310m this year.\" That's \u00a310m that Wenger has not got to spend on reinforcements. Alex Ferguson's consistent success over the past - and by far the richest - decade the game has ever known means he can afford to spend \u00a330m on maintaining his club's apparent monopoly. \"If you don't spend to improve then you can be sure that Manchester United will,\" said Bobby Robson this week, whose Newcastle side secured their Champions League place last Saturday. \"That is why they forge ahead. They keep one step ahead by reinvesting each year.\" In flexing the commercial muscle in such demonstrable fashion, United also up the ante for any pretenders, encouraging them to spend beyond their means in these fragile financial times. Who will be the next Leeds United? Of the two clubs in question, defeat on Sunday would surely have more catastrophic consequences for Chelsea, with widely reported company debts of \u00a380m-90m. However, ironically, since their spending has been curbed, Chelsea have become a more settled and consistent side who have made a steady improvement this season. While most Premiership clubs announced hefty losses this year, Liverpool, a private company with no intentions to become a plc, reported a \u00a39m profit. However, that figure was principally due to a recent injection of \u00a342m from Granada and, having benefited from Champions League cash in the last two years, going without this time would be more of a shock to their system and might lead to a scaling back of any future stadium and transfer plans. \"If we do not make the Champions League it is going to have an impact,\" said Parry this week. \"We all appreciate how important it is and there is no point pretending otherwise. \"We said when we put our plans together about three years ago that it was about getting into the Champions League and staying there. It has to be continuous. It is not about being there once or twice and then dropping out. It is vital that we are regular participants.\" And if things don't go to plan? \"You have got to try and achieve a balance whereby you are not mortgaging your future to the point where, if it does go wrong, you have got an enormous problem.\" Parry's former colleague at Leeds United, Peter Ridsdale, used to trot out very similar lines before it all went wrong there. The fact remains that Liverpool have spent \u00a364m more than they have earned in transfers in the past four years so Gerard Houllier can no longer afford to squander big money on players who under-perform like Bruno Cheyrou, Salif Diao and El-Hadji Diouf who collectively cost \u00a320m last summer. The irony is, of course, that one player they could have bought for \u00a313m last year may end up costing them far more than that this summer. Nicolas Anelka's goals at Anfield last weekend gave Chelsea the upper hand going into Sunday's match, leaving Houllier ashen-faced and tetchy in post-match interviews. When asked by Jon Champion to comment on Anelka's performance, Houllier lost his cool and told the ITV commentator that his perfectly reasonable question was \"out of order\". Such irritation is understandable when so much rests on so little. Champions League qualification means a great deal to both managers. Houllier described this match as being like a final, and for once he was not overstating the situation. With the better goal difference Claudio Ranieri's side need only a draw. \"We deserve to achieve a result against Liverpool, and I hope, along with the fans, that we can do it,\" the Italian said. Houllier naturally disagrees. \"I think we deserve it more than any other team,\" he responded. \"No team in the Premiership can have earned a place in the Champions League more than us.\" Apart from the ones that finished above his side, presumably. \"I mean it, we have shown our mental strength.\" Liverpool will need to summon all the mental fortitude they can muster to overturn a historical trend which is very much in Chelsea's favour. Liverpool have recorded just two victories at Stamford Bridge in the last 24 years, the last coming in 1989-90 - when they last won the title. Chelsea have beaten Liverpool nine times at home since then, including the last six matches on the trot. However, although Liverpool's home form this season is the worst for 49 years, they have won nine away games this season. Sunday is D-day. Relegation to the Nationwide costs clubs an estimated \u00a315m, and in eight of the last nine cases - Sheffield Wednesday, Watford, Wimbledon, Bradford City, Coventry City, Derby County, Ipswich Town and Leicester City - threatens their very existence. But, domestic demotion from the Champions League of gentlemen can be almost as costly - especially if you have gambled everything on qualifying. Just ask Leeds United.
