On a flat pitch he excelled at the old virtues of line and length, at venomous speed; there was no mystery to the success of this most honest, refreshing and aggressive bowler. So aggressive, indeed, that his captain Matthew Wood and both umpires, had a quiet word at times. But there is a pantomime element in Kirby's glares and finger-wagging which can only bring the game into repute; he is a character, and the game needs its Kirbys. His second-innings return was the best for Yorkshire since Craig White's eight for 55 against Gloucestershire in 1998, and his match figures the best since Ray Illingworth's 14 for 64 against the same opposition in 1967. When he was told of this statistic he was taken aback, as if in awe of walking with giants. \"We perform as a unit,\" he insisted. \"Today was my day, tomorrow Chris Silverwood's or Ryan Sidebottom's. I've been criticised in the past for taking wickets on helpful pitches, but I'm learning how to adapt to flat ones.\" Of his antics he said: \"I'm not going out there to be a complete chop all the time. You can look a complete clown. But there's a time and a place for aggression. As long as I don't offend anybody I'll stay like this.\" The man who once told Mike Atherton, \"I've seen better batters in my fridge,\" then evoked the name of the Lancastrian as an example of a batsman who'd always win a mind game. \"Look at the battles he's won.\" He paid similar tribute to Somerset's Peter Bowler and Aaron Laraman, whose stubbornness in a losing cause provoked some ripe exchanges. \"I'll do whatever I can to get them out. It's just a bit of fun.\" He did not know that one of his deliveries had ruptured Bowler's windpipe; the batsman will miss Somerset's next game. In the morning Somerset needed 24 to make Yorkshire bat again. Nixon McLean took them past the mark in a thrilling five-ball cameo at Silverwood's expense. Kirby returned to mop up, and either side of lunch the target of 70 produced no alarms for Wood and Stephen Fleming, to give Yorkshire maximum points."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
