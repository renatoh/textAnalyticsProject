Voting booths will open in the coming hours in the US presidential election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. There\u2019s a lot to take in, with the poll and its aftermath bound to sprawl across the news all week, so get started with this step-by-step guide. Keen UK readers might want to sneak in a nap today \u2013 because we expect the really serious action to commence after midnight GMT. Our US election live blog will be there at all times to shake you awake, should you find your endurance flagging. The first major indicator is going to be Florida, where polls fully close at 8pm Miami time (1am Wednesday in Britain). If Biden notches an early victory, Democrats will sense a win across the nation. If it is close in that state, things may be more drawn out; and if Trump wins Florida then the whole contest remains up for grabs. In terms of an overall national result: a landslide to Biden could mean a chance of a fairly quick declaration on Tuesday evening, US time. But would anyone be game enough to call it so early? If the vote is close a result may not be clear until Wednesday; or there could be a real cliffhanger, with the counting of mail-in ballots and possible lawsuits stretching it into days, or even weeks. And the outlook is excruciating: final polling shows Biden with a significant overall lead nationally \u2013 the majority in America want Trump out, Biden in \u2013 but the incumbent remains a threat in battleground states that could bring the electoral college votes he needs to win. Published polling may show Biden headed for a win \u2013 but as our US data editor, Mona Chalabi, writes, that kind of polling was wrong in 2016. Chalabi points to the participation of millions of new voters as a powerful potential deciding factor. As coronavirus continues to kill Americans \u2013 with more than 80,000 new cases reported on Sunday \u2013 Trump has held the last of his super-spreader events in the form of campaign rallies. He has told his supporters that Joe Biden wants to lock down America, which is not true. Barack Obama has called Trump out for \u201clying every day\u201d. As he continued to drag US democracy towards a tailspin, Trump threatened \u201cviolence on the streets\u201d if the vote count is not wrapped up quickly \u2013 his tweet was promptly slapped with a warning label by Twitter, as was another carrying false claims of voter fraud. David Smith writes that the president\u2019s profligate campaign could neither escape the pandemic nor find a way to define Biden, but he has whipped up his base into a frenzy \u2013 will it be enough to keep him in office? Delivering his closing message on the last day of the campaign, Biden repeated his campaign message that the election was a \u201cbattle for the soul of the nation \u2026 The character of America is literally on the ballot,\u201d he said at a drive-in rally in Cleveland, Ohio. \u201cIt\u2019s time to take back our democracy.\u201d * * * Vienna: three victims and gunman dead \u2013 Austrian police have continued overnight to hunt other gunmen still possibly at large after a string of shootings described by the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, as a \u201crepulsive terror attack\u201d left three victims dead, while one assailant was killed by armed officers in the city centre. Fifteen people were receiving hospital treatment, with seven in a critical condition. Authorities have been saying that more than one perpetrator may remain at large. The attacker they killed was described as an Islamic State sympathiser who wore a fake bomb belt. Shooters sprayed bullets at people outside bars that were open for the last night before a coronavirus lockdown. The initial shootings took place at six different locations in the city centre and authorities warned of a group of \u201cheavily armed and dangerous\u201d gunmen. Events unfolded near the Stadttempel synagogue, which was closed at the time. Emmanuel Macron has led the reaction by international leaders: \u201cAfter France, it is a friendly country that is attacked,\u201d said the French president, clearly referencing events including the church attack in Nice and the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty by an Islamist extremist. \u201cThis is our Europe. Our enemies must know who they are dealing with. We will not give up anything.\u201d * * * Depraved \u2013 Domestic violence charities have hailed the verdict from the high court trial in which Amber Heard gave accounts of an enraged Johnny Depp perpetrating drug and alcohol-fuelled abuse. The star has promised to appeal after a judge ruled he was not libelled by the Sun newspaper calling him a \u201cwife beater\u201d. Depp\u2019s lawyers said the decision was \u201cas perverse as it is bewildering\u201d and the judge had disregarded evidence from police, doctors and other unchallenged witnesses that \u201ccompletely undermined the allegations\u201d. Depp is also suing Heard, his former wife, for defamation in the US where Heard\u2019s lawyers said they would present \u201ceven more voluminous evidence \u2026 We are committed to obtaining justice for Amber Heard in the US court and defending Ms Heard\u2019s right to free speech.\u201d Ben Quinn notes how Heard stood essentially alone for much of a proceeding from which she had little or nothing to gain. * * * Coronavirus latest \u2013 The number of furloughed workers in the UK is expected to more than double this month to as many as 5.5 million as England heads into lockdown and emergency Covid-19 wage support is expanded. Businesses are expected to claim for billions of pounds of extra state support. Many employers have scrambled to put people back on furlough after the scheme\u2019s closure was reversed but for those already made redundant this has come too late. Retailers, hairdressers and restaurants in England have been extending their opening hours to accommodate a last wave of customers before lockdown hits. In Liverpool, up to half a million people are set to be tested under the UK government\u2019s first attempt to embark on city-wide mass testing and track down every positive case. Covid coverage continues at our global live blog. * * * \u2018He didn\u2019t propose\u2019 \u2013 It was one of the greatest cinematic love stories of the 20th century, but Sophia Loren has revealed that Cary Grant never proposed to her on set. The 86-year-old Italian actor has previously detailed a love affair with Grant while filming the 1957 film The Pride and the Passion. In an interview with the Radio Times she said: \u201cCary Grant was a very handsome man and a wonderful actor, but he didn\u2019t propose.\u201d Loren was 23 at the time, 30 years younger than Grant. She said she was too young to have any clear ideas about love and relationships at the time. Loren ended up marrying the film producer Carlo Ponti and they remained married until his death in 2007.

Journalist and biographer Evan Osnos examines what his past can tell us about the kind of president that the former vice-president could become. Lunchtime read: The fall of Johnny Depp In the 1990s, he was a different kind of film star \u2013 eloquent, artistic and cool. But this week, with the loss of his court case against the Sun, the dream has decisively soured, writes Hadley Freeman. Sport Fresh from winning the Giro d\u2019Italia, Britain\u2019s latest Grand Tour winner, Tao Geoghegan Hart, has spoken exclusively to the Guardian about leadership, why the team comes first and how he doesn\u2019t want his recent success to be a one-off.
