Booker has just four days left to meet stringent criteria set by the party for the next televised primary debate, in Los Angeles on 19 December. Should he fail to make the cut, the participants will be exclusively white, with more billionaires on stage than black people. In an interview with the Guardian, Booker said he was \u201cworried, very worried\u201d that the party was heading towards a repeat of the 2016 election in which Trump snatched an unexpected victory partly because of the softness of the African American vote. About 4.4 million voters who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 stayed home in 2016. More than a third were black. \u201cThere would be a President Hillary Clinton right now if the African American turnout had been close to what it had been in 2012,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThat\u2019s how real is the power and influence of the Democratic party\u2019s most loyal voting base.\u201d He added: \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to make sure there\u2019s a candidate on that stage that black and brown people in this country can trust, in whom they see their lived experience.\u201d The issue of the fading diversity in the Democratic race has become a major talking point in the wake of the California senator Kamala Harris dropping out for lack of funds. With Harris out, the spotlight is increasingly falling to Booker. He has been quick to sound the alarm over the consequences of black voters feeling undervalued as election year approaches. Asked what message an all-white stage would send African Americans, he told the Guardian: \u201cThe message is already being sent. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to civil rights leaders, Congressional Black Caucus members, you hear this being talked about now in the black community. People are saying there, \u2018This can\u2019t be,\u2019 especially when there is a candidate out there who is fully qualified under any objective criteria other than the arbitrary polling system.\u201d Booker has met the bar of 200,000 unique donors set by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) but is falling short of attaining 4% in four national or early state polls. Unless he can do that by Thursday he will not have a place at the debate. To rub salt into the wound, Tom Steyer, a billionaire hedge fund manager, has secured a position. Booker said the presence of billionaire candidates in the Democratic race \u2013 Michael Bloomberg is the other \u2013 was an insult to \u201cvoters who wonder how you can have talented, qualified, experienced, proven diverse candidates that aren\u2019t on the stage. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen how you gin your poll numbers up by running nonstop ads \u2013 that shouldn\u2019t be the decider of who\u2019s on stage at the debate, it sends a very bad signal.\u201d The Guardian asked Steyer what he thought of the argument that the race was being distorted with billionaires buying prominence while diverse candidates languished. He said: \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the diversity in the debates, too, and I have asked the DNC to change the criteria of the debates to get more diversity.\u201d Steyer has been able to use his personal wealth \u2013 he is worth $1.6bn according to Forbes \u2013 to vastly outspend Booker so far, buying $55m of TV and online ads to Booker\u2019s $3m. The disparity is paradoxical given that one of Steyer\u2019s main political platforms is combatting growing inequality. \u201cA lot of people have complained to the DNC about how this is going,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we have a diverse group of people competing for the nomination of the Democratic party and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair, but I don\u2019t run the process.\u201d The thorny question of billionaires using their financial muscle to wrestle themselves into the Democratic race has welled up again with the late entry of Bloomberg. The former New York mayor is outspending all the top-tier candidates combined, according to the Washington Post. It did not soothe the increasingly fractious mood when Bloomberg commented that Booker was \u201cwell spoken\u201d. He later apologised. Booker carved out his political reputation as mayor of Newark, New Jersey. He has a distinguished resume that includes having been a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, though he has complained that the media rarely point that out, unlike his Democratic rival Pete Buttigieg, also a Rhodes scholar. Booker said he was still confident he would make the debate later this month, joining those who have already been guaranteed a place: Buttigieg, Steyer, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar. The decision of more than a million African American voters to stay home rather than vote in 2016 is widely considered an important factor behind Trump\u2019s shock victory. Trump won the presidency comfortably in the electoral college yet in the key states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin he beat Clinton by only 77,000 votes. In the Wisconsin city of Milwaukee alone, Clinton attracted 70,000 fewer black votes than Obama in 2012. Booker said his anxieties about a potential repeat next November did not stop at the White House. He said low African American turnout could also have an effect on senatorial races in North and South Carolina, Georgia and Arizona that would prevent the Democrats taking back the Senate. \u201cI\u2019m very worried about consequences for the US Senate \u2013 it\u2019s not just Donald Trump,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWe cannot win in these very diverse states without not just good turnouts of African Americans \u2013 we need Obama\u2019s record turnouts again.\u201d Booker was speaking at a Democratic presidential forum in Cedar Rapids, Iowa organized by the Teamsters and focusing on workers\u2019 rights. The Guardian and The Storm Lake Times were media partners of the event."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
