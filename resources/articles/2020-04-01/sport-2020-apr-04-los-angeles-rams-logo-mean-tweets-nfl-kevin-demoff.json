The team\u2019s chief operating officer, Kevin Demoff, said he would read \u201cmean tweets\u201d about the new logo if a charity drive for Los Angeles United Way and Los Angeles Food Bank raised $2m. Demoff said the total had reached $2.3m when he posted the video of him reading criticism on his Twitter account. Comments included \u201cThere\u2019s a Rams logo debate? What is it between? Trash and hot garbage?\u201d and \u201cIf you\u2019re low on toilet paper, don\u2019t worry. You can get it now on NFL shop. #ramslogo\u201d. The new logo was met with near universal disgust when it launched last month, with many fans saying it looked cheap and tacky. However, fans hoping the team will change the logo, or revert back to the original may be disappointed. In a second Twitter post, Demoff did not say the logo would be dropped. \u201cWhile it isn\u2019t always the easiest to hear, we value the commentary you have provided on the logo &amp; colors,\u201d wrote Demoff, whose Twitter avatar is the new logo. \u201cWe are excited about the future of our team, our brand &amp; our stadium, but recognize we can always get better through feedback and engagement and appreciate your passion.\u201d The Rams are due to move into a new $5bn stadium at the start of the NFL season, which is scheduled to kick-off in September. The Rams will share the stadium with LA\u2019s other NFL team, the Chargers. The Rams and Chargers have struggled to build fanbases in LA since relocating to the city from St Louis and San Diego respectively."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
