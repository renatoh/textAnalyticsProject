Responding to news that the world's biggest economy shed 1.1m jobs in the last two months of 2008 alone, the president-elect said it was \"a stark reminder\" of the need for Capitol Hill to pass measures to boost growth. \"Clearly the situation is dire. It is deteriorating and it demands urgent and immediate action,\" Obama said, following a report from the labour department showing employers cut non-farm payrolls by 524,000 in December. With November's job shedding revised up to 584,000, economists said there was a risk that the US could be facing its toughest challenge since the 1930s. Obama said he was making good progress in talks with Congress on the stimulus package, which is expected to total $800bn (\u00a3500bn) or more, about 5% of GDP. The labour department said the jobless rate jumped to 7.2%, the highest level since 1993, from 6.8% in November. Economists said, however, that the official data underestimated the job crisis in the US. Professor Peter Morici, of the University of Maryland, said: \"The economy is in the jaws of a depression. Factoring in discouraged workers, unemployment is closer to 9.4%. Add workers in part-time positions that cannot find full-time employment and the hidden unemployment rate is 14.5%.\" Battered by the worst housing market collapse in the country's history and by an ever-deeper credit crunch, the US economy shed 2.6m jobs in 2008, the largest decline since a 2.75m drop in 1945, when the dole queues were briefly swelled by servicemen being demobilised. Paul Ashworth, of Capital Economics, said payrolls fell by an average of 500,000 a month in the final quarter of 2008. He said conditions were \"the weakest since the end of the second world war\". Job cuts were spread across the economy, with manufacturing, construction, retail and temporary work all severely hit. Ashworth said he expected the pace of decline in the job market to moderate but the underlying position would stay weak. \"It is a matter of perception. If the monthly declines now fall to less than 300,000, we would call that progress \u2026 Two months ago we would have described a drop of that magnitude as a catastrophe.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
