They are third in the country\u2019s Liga Primera and a home match against fourth-placed Walter Ferretti offers a chance to put the heat on those ahead while widening the six-point gap between the sides. It is tight at the top but Diriang\u00e9n have little appetite to compete and will do so from obligation alone. Nicaragua\u2019s league is one of only three competitions in the world \u2013 with Belarus and Burundi \u2013 continuing to operate during the coronavirus crisis and the decision to press on has sparked fear and disbelief. \u201cOur players do not want to continue playing,\u201d the Diriang\u00e9n general manager, Sergio Salazar, says. \u201cThey are very afraid and we understand them. We want to suspend the tournament but all the clubs have voted and the majority want to continue.\u201d Although circumstances are being reviewed weekly in a country that has publicly confirmed five cases of Covid-19, Diriang\u00e9n were the only club to oppose the league\u2019s continuation at its 10 clubs\u2019 latest meeting on Tuesday. The line from most of their rivals, including Wednesday\u2019s opponents, is that they will play until the ministry of health says it is unsafe to do so. It is virtually impossible to find anyone elsewhere in the division who will go on record to deviate from that view. Unpicking the situation requires a journey into the complex and murky world of Nicaraguan football. A condensed explanation is that almost all roads lead to the country\u2019s president, Daniel Ortega, a strongman for whom football represents a potent arm of internal power and a vision of stability to the outside world. Diriang\u00e9n are understood to be the only top-flight club with little or no funding from an arm of the state, although four would describe themselves as privately owned. It makes them outliers in a deeply repressive environment in which most of those competing are entirely dependent on direction from above. Ortega\u2019s regime wobbled in April 2018 when a protest movement took to the streets; it was neutralised bloodily but a series of general strikes followed and the country\u2019s economy has nosedived. Halting the football season \u2013 and indeed the more popular baseball league \u2013 would present the impression things are spiralling beyond control again. \u201cNot stopping the league is a result of the government\u2019s urgency to prove a normality that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d the journalist Camilo Vel\u00e1squez says. \u201cSince 2018 they\u2019ve been desperate to show things are back to normal and part of that includes functioning sports. Coronavirus became a big threat because they are scared of a general strike and shutting everything down would pretty much allow that.\u201d So football carries on. The Guardian interviewed two players from other teams and neither expressed doubts about persisting. \u201cThere is no concern on my part,\u201d says the Walter Ferretti forward Dshon Forbes. \u201cMy job is to play and while the institution in charge of health does not suspend these activities everything continues as normal.\u201d Pablo G\u00e1llego, a Spanish winger playing for Managua, adopted a near-identical tone and described himself as \u201csuper-happy\u201d with the club\u2019s care. \u201cIf I felt my physical integrity was at risk I\u2019m sure I could talk to them but we feel safe and feel appropriate measures are being taken,\u201d he says. Walter Ferretti are owned by the Nicaraguan police force, and Managua\u2019s players are paid by the capital city\u2019s mayoral office. That is not to reject the footballers\u2019 opinions out of hand but the incentives to opt against dissent are significant in a country believed to have 73 political prisoners. \u201cPlayers are very, very scared,\u201d explains Vel\u00e1squez, who says a number have messaged him privately to say they feel helpless and forced to play. \u201cWhen their income is football and the state is paying their salary, you can understand why they\u2019ll remain quiet.\u201d There have been a few flickers of support for Diriang\u00e9n\u2019s stance. Real Madriz, who are seventh in the league, appeared to have stuck their head above the parapet when they announced on social media they would not fulfil their match at Real Estel\u00ed on 22 March. But that message was mysteriously taken down; Madriz turned up and lost the game, traditionally a home banker, 4-0. Public opinion, already low after a perceived lack of support from the nation\u2019s players during the uprising of 2018, appears firmly in favour of a pause. But, while club Twitter accounts remind their fans \u201cQu\u00e9date a casa\u201d (\u201cStay at home\u201d), their teams continue to compete, albeit behind closed doors since the most recent round of games. \u201cIt is uncomfortable for the players but they prefer to use masks,\u201d Salazar says. It is an arresting, uneasy image and one that brings the situation\u2019s absurdity home. One of Diriang\u00e9n\u2019s stars, the Costa Rican forward Sebasti\u00e1n Barquero, has been allowed to return home and players have been told there will be no recriminations if they decide to down tools. In the meantime everyone else awaits evidence that Ortega\u2019s version of normality bears some resemblance to the reality inside the country\u2019s hospitals and on the streets. \u201cThe first thing we have to take care of is the health of our people,\u201d Salazar says. \u201cWe continue to think we should not play.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
