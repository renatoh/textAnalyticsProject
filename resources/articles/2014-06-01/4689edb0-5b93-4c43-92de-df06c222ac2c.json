On a night expected to be dominated by talk of the absent Luis Su\u00e1rez, it was the 22-year-old Monaco player who demanded attention. Tab\u00e1rez bracketed him with Lionel Messi, Diego Maradona and Su\u00e1rez in terms of talent. Tab\u00e1rez said: \u201cThey do things because they have certain gifts that make them special. I believe from what I\u2019ve seen he\u2019s the best player in the World Cup. I\u2019m not exaggerating. We tried to limit him a lot today but he kept coming and made his presence felt. Hopefully he will continue to move on because he\u2019s very young and football needs players with these characteristics.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez, after taking his tally to five goals in four games, the first a stunning volley that is a contender for the goal of the tournament, said their quarter-final against the hosts Brazil would be a \u201cbeautiful match\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy because we\u2019re making history. As a younger man I always wanted to be here. It is a dream. We want to do even more because this is a team that wants to win a lot.\u201d The triumphant Colombia coach, Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman, said Rodr\u00edguez was an \u201cextraordinary talent\u201d but also paid tribute to his team-mates. \u201cWhat is amazing is that he has no problem in taking responsibility. Football forces you to deal with a lot of situations and we are faced with a player who has the technical ability to be a top player at a world level.\u201d Tab\u00e1rez admitted that Uruguay had missed Su\u00e1rez, banned for four months and nine international matches after biting Italy\u2019s Giorgio Chiellini, but denied the saga had been a distraction. \u201cAmong the things we discussed before the match, we all knew about what happened but we had to stop thinking about it,\u201d said Tab\u00e1rez, who confirmed he was in talks over a new contract. \u201cWe said we should only bring out the positive things that could come out of this situation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
