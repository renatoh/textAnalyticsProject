Its Ireland on Sunday has been totally relaunched as a Mail on Sunday lookalike complete with a cover price of just 50 cent (32p) and a free copy of Hello! magazine - a move it claims has helped treble circulation. The cover price was first slashed on 19 May and the paper's circulation manager, Oliver Keenaghan, claims sales more than doubled to 110,000 from 50,000 the previous week. And the paper claims that last week, following an extensive TV and radio advertising campaign and giveaways including an 80-page TV listings magazine, sales rose dramatically to 180,000. Mr Keenaghan told the Sunday Business Post while increased sales of the tabloid are taking some readers away from midmarket rivals the Sunday Independent and Sunday World, the majority of new sales come from people buying the Ireland on Sunday as a secondary paper, especially considering its current low price. The Irish Daily Mirror and the Irish Sun both followed the lead of their UK counterparts in slashing their cover prices to 50 cent, respective cuts of 37.5% and 20%, although the Mirror announced last week it would resume its former cover price. Associated Newspapers bought Ireland on Sunday in September 2001 in a \u00a37m-plus deal. Its editor, Martin Clarke, a former editor of the Scotsman nicknamed \"the rottweiler\", has been accused by critics of anglicising the paper, dubbing it England on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
