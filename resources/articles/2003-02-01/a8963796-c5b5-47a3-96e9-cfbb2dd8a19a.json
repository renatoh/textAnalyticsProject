With the Windies needing 242 to win on a slowing pitch, I reckon this match could have more nips and tucks in it than a Beverley Hills plastic surgery clinic. A decent first over from Bond, by the way. Tight, and without a hint of width. Just to let you know, I'll be here for the first 15 overs before going off to the gym, and then my colleague, Lawrence Booth, will take over. Before I forget, apologies to Peter Allen (and countless others) who point out that I said Harris hit a six in the 48th over. \"Harris must be a noted big hitter if he's still laying into the Windies attack from the pavilion, where he's been since being bowled by Gayle,\" Peter says, before insisting he's not a professional pedant. Hmm. Whatever you say, Peter. 2nd over: West Indies 1-0 (Gayle 0, Hinds 1) Another steady over, this time from Andre Adams - who, so my colleague Lawrence Booth tells me, has a habit of wickets with atrocious deliveries. Can he do it again? 3rd over: West Indies 2-0 (Gayle 0, Hinds 1) Bond is quickly into his stride: he's already banging them in at 90mph-plus and tests Gayle with a sharpish delivery which swings late. Mark my words: this one has all the makings of a classic. 4th over: West Indies 3-0 (Gayle 1, Hinds 1) Just like on Sunday, West Indies are making a slow, slow start. The run rate is already up to 5.20. Another good over from Adams, which is quietish apart from a muted lbw appeal. 5th over: West Indies 7-0 (Gayle 5, Hinds 1) That's more like it - Bond's delivery is fast and on the stumps, but Gayle adjusts well and bullies a fullish drive to the boundary. This from Andrea Lowe. \"I just wanted to pass on my thanks to all the bored geeks who looked up those Astle stats for me,\" she says, in a not-entirely-complimentary way. \"I now have the proof to back up my favourite pub argument that he isn't a world class player because he's only good against England, which is about as impressive as being good against Bangladesh. \"He's got a really small face as well, which isn't his fault and is a rather unkind thing to point out, but I haven't liked him ever since that 222 in Christchurch.\" Harsh, Andrea, harsh. We can't all be as good-looking as Stephen Fleming, can we? 6th over: West Indies 13-0 (Gayle 5, Hinds 7) Another expensive over - as Hinds pulls Adams for a boundary and picks up another couple along the way. Incidentally, Andrew Finnegan has just asked me for betting advice (always a dangerous thing to do). \"The Paddy Power odds for the next wicket are: C Gayle, evens; W Hinds, 8-11,\" he says. \"Who looks likely?\" I'd say Gayle looks in slightly better nick at the moment, but even so, I'd advise a no bet here. Sorry. 7th over: West Indies 21-0 (Gayle 10, Hinds 9) Doesn't Gayle love that cover drive! Big things were expected of him in this World Cup and, after failing against South Africa, he's making up for it here. 8th over: West Indies 33-0 (Gayle 22, Hinds 9) The West Indies are on fire and Adams is taking a pasting. Gayle smashes three boundaries in a row before nearly edging one to the wicketkeeper. On to your emails, where Andrea Lowe has upset Rob Marsh, one of the \"geeks\" who helped her out with Nathan Astle's statistics. \"I refute the geek comment,\" says Rob, probably whilst adjusting his anorak. \"Bored at work maybe - but I didn't look anything up, just used my common sense as each time I watch a cricket match, everyone's best is always against England. And I was proved right - albeit by a geek!\" 9th over: West Indies 34-0 (Gayle 22, Hinds 9) A raucous appeal from New Zealand after Fleming takes a catch off Hinds! Sadly for the Black Caps, Bonds' s swerving, speeding delivery caught shoulder, not bat. Not out. \"Andrea's cricket tastes strike me as odd,\" says Robert Wright. \"Why wouldn't you like Astle for hitting one of the most brilliant, flamboyant innings ever? Even from a jingoistic point of view, it doesn't make much sense, since he failed to prevent one of England's occasional overseas victories.\" Agree completely, Rob. WICKET! Gayle goes for 22, bowled by a wide-ish delivery from Adams, caught Fleming. West Indies are now 34-1 10th over: West Indies 36-2 (Lara 2, Hinds 9) UNBELIEVABLE! LARA IS RUN OUT FOR TWO FROM A DIRECT HIT! He goes for what looks like a safe three and finds himself back in the pavilion! How did it happen? Well, Lou Vincent chucked it to Chris Cairns, who then smashed the stumps from wide mid-on. Just one over ago, the Windies were coasting. Now they're rocking more than a funktastic Little Richard and Chuck Berry double bill. To your emails... \"I'm beginning to feel envious of you guys, not only do you get to watch and talk sport, you also get to go to the gym whilst at work. Bliss,\" says Abu Berat. \"Any tips on recovery techniques, I'm still suffering from Sunday's workout.\" No probs, Abu - stagger your work-outs (different body parts on different days), don't work out when you're still sore and rest, rest, rest. Sorry, that's too much information, isn't it? 11th over: West Indies 38-2 (Chanderpaul 1, Hinds 10) A steady over, with the Windies remaining watchful. After what happened in the previous over, you can't blame them. Incidentally can anyone out there help Rob Trubey, who writes: \"Having failed to book a place at a restaurant, I've foolishly agreed to cook my girlfriend dinner, tomorrow, for Valentine's Day. As someone who finds boil-in-a-bag a potential nightmare, I was hoping someone might be able to suggest something easy (and preferably edible) for me to serve up.\" Over to you. WICKET! Another one goes! Hinds tries blitzing Adams but smashes it straight down Styris's throat. He goes for 10 and the Windies are 42-3 12th over: West Indies 43-3 (Chanderpaul 1, Hooper 1) Carl Hooper is a lucky, lucky man - he gets an inside edge but the ball drops just shot of the wicketkeeper. The West Indies are now rocking more than an AC/DC, Aerosmith, Deep Purple and Saxon poodle-perm heavy quadruple bill. \"Isn't it interesting that NZ players always seem to play well against countries that they could technically qualify to play for,\" says Tan Copsey. \"Adams today, Vincent and Bond against Australia.\" Good point, Tan, good point. 13th over: West Indies 43-3 (Chanderpaul 1, Hooper 1) A maiden from Bond as the Windies decide to dig in. Despite their strong batting line up, that's wise. Consolidation, not Calypso cricket is needed here. \"Enjoying the banter,\" says the sensible sounding Kate Carter. \"Oh, and the cricket too. Tell Rob that M&amp;S appear to be doing a special Valentine's range. Failing that, Nigel Slater is always a good bet.\" 14th over: West Indies 43-3 (Chanderpaul 2, Sarwan 0) Your first Valentine recipe is in. Take it away, Mike Cooper. \"Get two tuna steaks and marinade (leave in) lime juice and coriander over night, he says. \"On the day, grill the tuna steaks for about seven minutes each side til nice and pink inside, boil some noodles, heat up the juice left over from the marinade with butter. Noodles around the plate, tuna in middle, sauce on top. I thank you.\" The office consensus is that that's a mighty fine dish, Mike. Being veggie, however, it's not for me... WICKET!!!! Andre Adams strikes again!!!! I mentioned early that he had a habit of getting wickets with poor deliveries and this one is handed to him on a plate: Hooper slashing it straight to Bond, who doesn't have to move. The Windies are now 46-4 - and the 196 they need to win seems a long, long way away. ANOTHER WICKET!!!! Now Chanderpaul goes, lbw Oram, for two. There is some doubt, however whether the ball pitched in line. Windies now 46-5. 15th over: West Indies 50-5 (Powell 4, Sarwan 0) After a torrid start, West Indies finally bring up the 50. Surely it's all over though, isn't it? Meanwhile David Voss writes: \"An interesting aside on Saxon (and their weighty singer Biff Byford) - they have now reformed under their original name of Son of A Bitch. \"They still rock, though,\" he adds, as if there was any doubt. Speaking of rockers, it's time to pass the commentary onto my colleague, Lawrence Booth. Thanks for all your emails. 16th over: West Indies 71-5 (Powell 10, Sarwan 13) Hello, Lawrence here again. Well, Sean hasn't left me with much action to describe, but I can report that Cairns has just bowled his first over in international cricket since March 2002 and it cost him 21! Sarwan hammers a no-ball through point for four, pulls him for four more, then cuts him for another boundary. Not wanting to feel left out, Powell hooks him high into the seats at midwicket for six. Maybe this game isn't dead after all. 17th over: West Indies 71-5 (Powell 10, Sarwan 13) The calm after the storm as Oram bowls a maiden to Sarwan. \"Why doesn't Rob Trubey check out a Nigel Slater book (good suggestion, Kate Carter) in Borders or somewhere where he can jot the recipe down without actually buying the book, get the ingredients in, and then feign a migraine tomorrow night?\" asks Gordon Gibbs. \"What should then happen, is that his girlfriend will cook the meal for the pair of them. He's shown willing, they both get to enjoy the meal (although he may need to look pained every now and then) and everybody's happy.\" Genius, Gordon. 18th over: West Indies 75-5 (Powell 12, Sarwan 15) Vettori gets his first over, which means Cairns could well finish the match with figures of 1-0-21-0. West Indies are calming down after that brief purple patch, and manage just four singles there. \"Just to introduce a bit of a political conscience to the days events,\" says Andi Thomas. \"How many readers are planning on attending the march this Saturday? And (spot the tenuous link) does anyone have any cricket-related slogans to shout at the evil warlords Tony and George?\" 19th over: West Indies 77-5 (Powell 12, Sarwan 17) Oram, known to his team-mates as Shrek because of his ears, is a huge man and stands 1.99m in his cotton socks. he's using his height to good advantage here and is banging the ball in just short of a length. West Indies scrape just two to third man. \"Of course anyone who supports cricket should be backing the Windies to win the entire World Cup, so that the kids can be weaned off all that God-awful basketball rubbish they are leaving cricket for and become a great cricketing force again. Go Windies, I say.\" That' in case you were wondering, is the view of Angus Savory, who mysteriously describes himself as a Very Bored English Language Learning writer. 20th over: West Indies 80-5 (Powell 14, Sarwan 18) Vettori looks more like Harry Potter, because of his glasses. And he can sure weave a spell outside off - three more runs there. It's all gone quiet. Some culinary advice from Chris Miller for Rob Trubey. \"This is easy and requires little actual cooking but is quite impressive. It's called Tagliatelle Brie bake. First cook your tagliatelle, about 250g or whatever you think is enough for two. Chop an onion and (if liked) a couple of garlic cloves. Fry until golden. Take a large handful of button mushrooms, quarter them and add to the onion. Fry a bit. Drain the juice from a can of tomatoes. Mix the juice with 100ml creme fraiche. Add the tomatoes to the onion mix but don't heat. MIx everything (pasta, onion/mush/tom mix, tomatoey creme) together with salt, pepper and chopped fresh basil. Put in a baking dish. Cover the top of the pasta mix with chopped Brie, a bit of grated Parmesan and some more basil. Stick in the oven at GM 4 or 5 for 40-50 minutes or until the cheese melts nicely. \"Bosh,\" as some fool might say.\" WICKET! Powell b Oram 14 (14), West Indies 80-6 (20.1) That, surely, is that. Oram gets one to cut back off the seam and fly through a large gate obligingly left open by Powell's loose drive. West Indies are in disarray, and New Zealand are finally going to win their first one-day international on South African soil. 21st over: West Indies 81-6 (Sarwan 18, Jacobs 1) Great stuff from Oram, who now has 2 for 7 off five overs. 22nd over: West Indies 83-6 (Sarwan 19, Jacobs 2) Vettori keeps West Indies quiet. Their aim at the moment has to be prevent a defeat that will do irreparable damage to their net run-rate. This looks like being quite a tight group now, so these things could be important. Just ask England, who went out on run-rate in 1999. 23rd over: West Indies 86-6 (Sarwan 22, Jacobs 2) Oram on the money again. \"Some geeks certainly have their uses,\" says Peter Lovell. \"The geek sitting next to me has installed something onto my PC which lets me view your commentary in Outlook without colours etc. My team leader will no longer be able to complain at me not doing any work and looking at the Guardian website all day. Unless she monitors my e-mails, that is.\" Or reads this, Peter... 24th over: West Indies 89-6 (Sarwan 23, Jacobs 4) Fleming was right when he said at the toss that this pitch would get slower as the day wore on. Oram and Vettori are the perfect pair to exploit the lack of pace, and West Indies, who love the ball coming onto the bat, are probably the perfect team to bowl at. Vettori concedes just three runs there as West Indies inch towards three figures. Caroline Walford is feeling ruthlessly practical. \"Or even less bother (following the search for recipes) go on the Delia web site; lovely lady, lovely recipes.\" There you go. 25th over: West Indies 93-6 (Sarwan 26, Jacobs 5) Back comes Bond. Sarwan drives his first ball through extra cover for three, but Jacobs can make nothing of his toe-crunching exocets. Meanwhile, the ladies are getting their revenge on Rob Trubey. \"If he feigns a migraine to get out of cooking, he won't get any fun later on, will he?\" points out Louise Wright, with the sharpness of a woman who knows what she's talking about. \"And she'll probably leave the washing up in the sink for him anyway (if she's got any sense) so he's saddled with at least one tedious task either way.\" Fair point, Louise. 26th over: West Indies 97-6 (Sarwan 29, Jacobs 6) Sarwan is refusing to go down without a tussle, and strokes Vettori for two into the covers. But one more wicket and we're into the tail. This game could be over very soon. \"In response to Andi Thomas [who asked whether anyone would be going on the anti-war march] this is the Guardian's website,\" says Owen Evans. \"Almost all of us I would have thought?\" 27th over: West Indies 103-6 (Sarwan 30, Jacobs 11) I had money on Bond to be leading wicket-taker in the World Cup, but he's really letting me down. Come on Shane! The left-handed Jacobs rubs my nose in it by whacking Bond down the ground as if he were a medium-pacer. A good shot but a bit late to change the course of this game. Bernard Keane in Canberra is the latest to respond to Rob Trubey's email. \"Mr Trubey should tell his girlfriend that Valentine's Day is a \"Hallmark Holiday\" that symbolises American cultural imperialism and accordingly he's not celebrating it. If he MUST cook, let it be something French, since they're one of the few to tell the Americans where to get off. And their food is better than the Germans'.\" I've just come back from Berlin, Bernard, where I can tell you the sausages are excellent. 28th over: West Indies 109-6 (Sarwan 33, Jacobs 14) Six runs to West Indies off that Vettori over, but they'll need more than that. Jon Gerrard has clearly cooked for his loved one before. \"Get a few smoked haddock fillets, some lasagne sheets and a couple of tubs of creme fraiche. build up in alternate layers, some cheese on top and into the oven at about 230 for 40 mins, allowing you time to create a fake mess in the kittchen to make it look like you've been slaving away while in fact you're just getting a head start on the champagne.\" Brilliant, Jon. 29th over: West Indies 113-6 (Sarwan 36, Jacobs 15) New Zealand are keen to finish this one off, so back comes the outstanding Oram. But Sarwan is playing with real composure and West Indies hang on in there. The ball isn't doing much now. \"Anyone who really loves cricket should in fact be supporting New Zealand,\" writes Tan Copsey. \"Mainly because nothing would irritate the Australians more than us winning!\" Tan might have used a phrase other than irritate, but the details escape me. 30th over: West Indies 115-6 (Sarwan 37, Jacobs 16) On comes Astle to try to tempt the big-hitting Jacobs into some kind of murderous indiscretion. The ploy fails miserably and West Indies are almost saying ya boo and sucks as they restrain themselves to the tune of two singles. Well, the cheapskates are crawling out of the woodwork now. Here's Kieran Faulkner. \"Cook some chicken breasts in a pan. Add one tube of tomato puree, one onion, some mushrooms, a sprinkle of any of the herbs that you may have in your cupboard. Note: be sure to be seen grinding some pepper of the top of as it's cooking. Serve with pasta. No one ever complains.\" No, Keith, but if you're planning to try that one tomorrow night, your lady might. 31st over: West Indies 118-6 (Sarwan 39, Jacobs 17) As the shadows lengthen in Port Elizabeth, Oram's figures now read 8-2-17-2. He's forcing the batsmen onto the back foot, which limits their range of strokes. Or something like that. Anyway, he's not going for many runs. Spencer Jones poses an interesting metaphysical question. \"How do you deal with an email from someone who seems to know who you are, but you don't have a clue who they are, or how they know you? Obviously, this is the problem of 'a friend'.\" Of course, Spencer, of course. Play it cool. That's what Sean Ingle taught me. 32nd over: West Indies 121-6 (Sarwan 41, Jacobs 18) Astle's dibbly-dobblies suit this wicket down to the ground. He trots in off eight paces and lands it outside off. Tedious but effective, and just three more singles to the total. Back to Rob and his recipes. Andrea Lowe has joined the cheapskates' bandwagon. \"I've got the number of a nice pizza delivery company in Wandsworth if Rob Trubey is interested,\" she offers, helpfully. \"Not sure how interested his girlfriend would remain if he provided a Valentine's meal of takeaway though.\" How would you feel, Andrea? Eh? 33rd over: West Indies 126-6 (Sarwan 46, Jacobs 18) A little known and quite startling fact is that Sarwan came into this game with a one-day career average of 52. Ok, so he bats at No. 6 and picks up a lot of not-outs, but even so. The way he's playing here, it's no surprise. He times the hitherto unhittable Oram through extra cover for four, but Oram fights back and concedes just a single for the rest of the over. West Indies need 116 to win from 17 overs. 34th over: West Indies 129-6 (Sarwan 48, Jacobs 19) West Indies are living mainly off singles at the moment as Astle hurries through another over. Still, these two have added 49 so far, so at least I'm getting some work to do. Terry Bentham has some thoughts on the Chanderpaul dismissal. \"You say there is some doubt the ball pitched in line,\" he writes. \"As a qualified umpire I can tell you it does not have to pitch in line. It does have to hit him in line if he plays a shot though.\" The question, Terry, was whether it pitched outside leg. If it does, a batsman cannot be out. 35th over: West Indies 133-6 (Sarwan 51, Jacobs 20) Sarwan brings up the 50 stand with a pull for one off Oram, then reaches his own half-century with a tuck for two off his hip. It took him 71 balls. The Windies need 109 off 15. It's not impossible, but it's a very long shot. \"What's the latest on England?\" asks Yalvi. \"Has ICC made a decision about whether the game will be held at a later date somewhere else?\" Not yet, Yalvi, but Jagmohan Dalmiya, the president of the Indian Cricket Board, has said that England should not only forfeit their points for failing to go to Harare, but they should be docked a further four as well. Hmm. 36th over: West Indies 139-6 (Sarwan 52, Jacobs 25) Jacobs comes to life with an uppish one-handed cover-drive after Astle did him in the air with a slower one. That was a clever piece of adjustment from Jacobs. Six off the over. At the same stage, New Zealand were 153 for 6. Suddenly, this game is looking a little closer than it once appeared. Here's Sarah Wilson. \"I'm not very funny so I won't try to be. But on the subject of THE march, could you please tell the bloke who wrote in that's there's also one in Glasgow (where Tony Blair will be this Saturday). We could try giving him a 'you're out' finger but few would get it up here, and we might just appear slightly deranged. Cheers for the coverage.\" No problems, Sarah. 37th over: West Indies 140-6 (Sarwan 53, Jacobs 25) Styris comes on to bowl, and keeps West Indies quiet with his waddling medium-pace. I've just chickened out of offering Sean Ingle 12-1 against West Indies winning this. I stood to lose \u00a360 and win \u00a35. I hope Sean understands. Dave Holme has a good point. \"While this is the Guardian website, it is also the Guardian Sport website and therefore some readers may choose Man U vs Arsenal and England vs France ahead of the march.\" 38th over: West Indies 142-6 (Sarwan 54, Jacobs 26) Back comes Vettori, who goes round the wicket to the left-handed Jacobs. The batsmen can only scamper two singles, and I'm beginning to wish I'd taken on Sean's bet. Peter Lovell is trying to make up for calling his colleague a geek earlier. \"Geek next to me is upset that I didn't refer to him by his name,\" he apologises. \"Can you say thanks to Jules Fothergill for me. Although if it was me I'd rather be known as 'Geek' anyway.\" You just can't help yourself, can you Peter... 39th over: West Indies 150-6 (Sarwan 54, Jacobs 34) Jacobs goes down on one knee to mow Styris to cow corner for a couple, and then gets a flukey outside edge as he aims to sweep and gets away with four over the keeper's head. Ninety-two needed off 11. I'm beginning to worry about the people who read this site. Here's Gordon Gibbs. \"Louise Wright clearly hasn't thought this through,\" he says. \"All Rob has to do, post dinner, is say \"That was a wonderful meal, but I still have the migraine; why don't we go an lie down in a dark room?\". Well, I've never met Rob, but it would probably work for me if I was his bird. He gets dinner and he gets some action. This is the way forward, I'm telling you!\" If you have a lady friend, Gordon, I do hope she's not reading this. 40th over: West Indies 157-6 (Sarwan 60, Jacobs 35) There are one or two signs here that New Zealand are getting annoyed. Sarwan creams Vettori to the cover fence for four, and three more singles make it an easy seven off the over. \"I concur, the sausages in Berlin are most outstanding, as is the city,\" says Spencer Jones. \"However, did you encounter the strange cultural competition in Germany of serving the largest possible sausage with the smallest possible piece of bread?\" I did, Spencer. And I came third. 41st over: West Indies 162-6 (Sarwan 64, Jacobs 36) Adams brilliantly cuts off a boundary on the midwicket fence as Sarwan tucks Styris for two. West Indies need 80 off nine, which is about nine an over. Lucy Sweetman returns to our Valentine's theme. \"Clearly Valentine's Day should be celebrated with either: rare steak with chips and salad, or Sainsbury's fresh mussels in a bag thing with chips and salad. Tasty and guaranteed to get your engines revving. Obvious really.\" Thanks Lucy. Rob will be pleased. 42nd over: West Indies 168-6 (Sarwan 69, Jacobs 37) Adams, who knocked the top off this West Indian innings with three quick wickets, returns to the attack, and bowls a great over until the final ball when Sarwan flicks him past short fine leg for four. Adams is furious: he had gone for just two singles until then. They need 74 off eight. \"WHO ARE YOU CALLING KEITH?!\" thunders Kieran Faulkner. Sorry Keith. My brain's going soft. 43rd over: West Indies 176-6 (Sarwan 74, Jacobs 39) Sarwan spots Styris's slower ball and deposits him straight down the ground for four. My word, this could go down to the wire. What a comeback from the Windies, who now need 66 off 42 balls. Robert Jackson again. \"I reject the accusation from Owen Evans that if you are on the Guardian website you must be one of these Tony Benn-worshipping marcher people who have nothing better to do on a Saturday than stomp around London and achieve precisely nothing. The point being that it's the top-notch Sports coverage that brings many of us here rather than any left-leaning tendencies.\" I like Robert Jackson. WICKET! Sarwan b Vettori 75 (99), West Indies 178-7 (43.3) Sarwan advances down the track and tries to work Vettori through midwicket. But the ball passes through the gate and Sarwan is bowled. Vettori punches the air in delight - that's a very big wicket. However, the game isn't over yet, because Nixon McLean can hit the ball a very long way indeed. First, though, it's Vasbert Drakes. 44th over: West Indies 180-7 (Jacobs 41, Drakes 1) Just four runs off the over and a wicket for Vettori. Exactly what Fleming ordered. West Indies need 62 off 36 balls. \"I'm not sure why everyone's banging on about main courses,\" moans David Nagel. \"Just tell Rob to end the meal with some sort of chocolate based dessert and all will be hunky-dory. It doesn't have to be posh - an unwrapped mars bar will do if any of the girls I've been out with are typical. Actually, make that either of the girls.\" Good grief. WICKET! Jacobs c Oram b Styris 50 (73), West Indies 191-8 (44.6) What a catch! Moments after heaving Styris for six to move to fifty, Jacobs gets an almighty edge to third man where Oram dives forward and holds on with both hands inches above the ground. Brilliant! West Indies now need 51 off five overs. It's amazing what you learn doing this job. Here's Joe Hemmant. \"What Rob needs to realise is that it's not what he cooks tomorrow night that matters but it's that he is there on Saturday morning able to make that \"commitment\" (the 'c' word men hate) and preferably to do the washing up as well. I am learning this as I go along - presently I am doing a degree in disaster avoidance.\" 46th over: West Indies 194-8 (Drakes 2, McLean 2) Good stuff from Vettori who keeps the ball up to the bat and prevents the tail-enders from freeing their arms. Forty-eight off 24 balls is surely beyond West Indies now. \"Is Terry a qualified umpire in the Fullers Middlesex Championship by any chance?\" asks Peter Lovell. \"I get a lot of decisions like that.\" 47th over: West Indies 200-8 (Drakes 3, McLean 5) Bond returns to the attack, which is not a move designed to cheer up Drakes and McLean. Just six off the over when the Windies needed twice as many. Still, it's been a lot of fun. Just 42 needed off 18 balls. \"Can Sarah Wilson tell me where and when the Glasgow anti-war march is?\" begs Paul Headon. \"If it isn't raining and doesn't clash with the England-France rugby match, then I may well attend - never let it be said that I am a fair-weather protester!\" You said it, Paul. We didn't. WICKET! McLean run out (Adams) 5 (7), West Indies 200-9 (47.1) Oh dear. Drakes's attempted swing to leg off Adams hits him in the midriff and dribbles back down the pitch. The only problem is that McLean has set off like a madman, and by the time he realises what's going on, Adams has calmly picked the ball up and trotted to the non-striker's end to dislodge the bails. New Zealand live to fight another day. 48th over: West Indies 205-9 (Drakes 7, Dillon 1) Lots of heaving and not much connecting. Group B is turning into a cracker. Ben Hendy writes in rather sadly. \"I was wondering if anyone out there has any advice for us singletons on Valentine's Day? Anyone got any cast-iron lines to use when out looking for ladies? Or does anyone know of any hotspots down in Southampton?\" Stay at home, Ben. That's my advice. 49th over: West Indies 205-9 (Drakes 14, Dillon 7) Well, West Indies take 13 off that Bond over with a mixture of slices and slashes. It leaves them needing 24 off the last over. Steve O'Connor writes. \"My Dutch boss, about whom I wrote yesterday, has requested that I now keep him fully informed of his country's progress in the World Cup, so perhaps we have another convert to the great game. In Prague the sausages are just as good as those found in Berlin (perhaps a little less spicy), although here you get two decent slices of fresh bread with your piece of meat as opposed to the measly one the Germans give you. I must say though that their mustard is better than ours - sharper, and usually more than the one sweet variety the Czechs offer.\" Good stuff. THAT'S IT! WICKET! Dillon b Adams 8 (6), West Indies 221 all out (49.4) Dillon tries to smash Adams into kingdom come, misses, and is bowled. New Zealand have won by 20 runs, and Adams has four wickets. New Zealand win their first ever one-day international in South Africa and their World Cup hopes live on. For West Indies, it's back down to earth after that euphoric win over South Africa on Sunday. For me, it's goodbye. And thanks for your emails and excellent company."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
