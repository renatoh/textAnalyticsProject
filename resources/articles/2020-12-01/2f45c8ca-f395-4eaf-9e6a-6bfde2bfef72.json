Bill Sweeney, the RFU\u2019s chief executive, does say, however, that the union are wary of the potential impact on the game\u2019s image and that making rugby entirely risk-free is \u201ca journey with no conclusion\u201d. Like everyone else the RFU has been \u201cvery sad and distressed\u201d to learn that the 2003 World Cup-winning hooker Steve Thompson is among a number of players showing signs of early onset dementia in their early 40s. As yet, however, Twickenham is still awaiting precise details of the proposed legal proceedings and Sweeney believes his organisation would be insured in the event of any huge future payout. \u201cI\u2019ve got no reason to believe we wouldn\u2019t be covered for this, but we\u2019re not going into that detailed discussion until we see the nature of what is being submitted,\u201d said Sweeney. \u201cIt\u2019s hypothetical at this stage because we don\u2019t know what \u2018this\u2019 is yet.\u201d Given that the diagnosed individuals so far include Thompson and Michael Lipman, both former England internationals who spent much of their club careers in the Premiership, the RFU is well aware of the potentially calamitous repercussions if rugby starts being perceived as too dangerous. \u201cIt would be disingenuous to say we\u2019re not worried about reputational risk, but we certainly believe it is manageable,\u201d said Sweeney. \u201cWe believe everything is being done \u2013 and will continue to be \u2013 to make sure rugby is a safe sport for kids to take up. We\u2019re dealing with the white heat emotion of what is a really difficult human story \u2026 but most people understand the benefits you get from playing rugby. They still feel it\u2019s a sport they get more out of than it takes out of them.\u201d Sweeney also argues that American football \u2013 a $765 million compensation settlement to affected former players was made by the NFL in 2013 \u2013 and rugby union are two different sports which cannot be casually lumped together in the context of brain injuries. \u201cIt is very hypothetical, the science is not black and white,\u201d said Sweeney. \u201cThere is no scientific proof of the causal link between concussion and CTE [chronic traumatic encephalopathy], that is not a proven thing. There are differences between American football and rugby union. \u201cBut we do need to allay people\u2019s fears and I think you do that by having a really balanced, fact-based conversation around what the issues are. We need the debate to be really factual and lay out all the detail. Then, as with so many things in life, there is a risk-reward balance that you make a decision on. \u201cOur evidence shows that rugby is no more dangerous than other sports. But this is a journey with no conclusion to it. This is not a project with a start and finish date. As players get fitter and stronger we have to find ways to adapt.\u201d To date, Sweeney has yet to speak personally to Thompson \u2013 the RFU says it had an out-of-date mobile number for him \u2013 but rugby director, Conor O\u2019Shea, has been understandably moved by the former Northampton hooker\u2019s diagnosis. \u201cI find it really upsetting what is happening \u2026 but the game you see between England and France is not the same game your kid arrives down to play at under-8 level. The whole way through is graduated.\u201d The financial effects of Covid-19, meanwhile, are set to cost the RFU \u00a3135m in revenue in the 2020\u201121 financial year but Sweeney is predicting an overall loss of \u201conly\u201d \u00a330m, partly as a result of the RFU cutting 165 roles and making savings of \u00a330m. \u201cThe RFU business model is inherently still sound, but it will take a few more years to get back to being debt free,\u201d he said.Sweeney also confirmed that discussions about the establishment of a new-look global fixture calendar are \u201cstill ongoing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
