They scoured the runes and scanned the heavens for intimations of a hard winter. Before Christmas, they saw the media stirring up a crisis, with body-on-trolley stories spreading like the pox. Watching the BBC's complicity, as they regarded it, in the mongering of health scares, they knew which act of God was likely to derail their plans: 20 degrees below and not a bed to spare anywhere in the NHS. It didn't happen. Instead they got the plague of foot and mouth, which is far worse. Their mind-set, on the other hand, is unaltered. Just as they would have to manage the politics of beds to keep their electoral plans on track, so they look on foot and mouth as a disaster they must find ways of working round, in the interests of democracy. The election must have its day. I think, on the contrary, that this terrible visitation puts politics in perspective. If ministers fail to see this, they will enrich their reputation for being concerned only with their self-created world. There shouldn't be any doubt about it. Unless the plague is quelled in the next 10 days, it should be not merely possible but axiomatic that the May date is abandoned. What, after all, are elections for? What are they meant to be about? Who are they supposed to engage? There's already a tendency to envisage this one as some thing like the blitz. In a land semi-paralysed by restrictions, gallant country folk will stagger to the polls, or fill in the exciting new postal ballots that everyone can now claim, to perform their democratic duty. Before election day, they may have to do without the usual round of meetings, which hardly anyone attends anyway. Campaigning could not reach them. But, immured on their farms, they can keep in touch with the candidates on the telly. In this way, the emergency need not stop the vote. The enemy shall not pass. Actually, this is a phoney war. Only politicians call May 3 unalterable. We do not need an election until May next year. Usually we put up with the manipulations that have become legendary, by which prime ministers foreshorten their mandate. Mostly we just sigh with stoic scepticism at their reading of the national interest. But suddenly, here we have a competing national crisis, which may well make a normal election impossible to hold. Only by transmuting scepticism into cynicism can one find the slightest explanation as to why anyone would pretend that such an election, gratuitously called, must inexorably unfold. Naked self-interest is all that could allow that to happen. For a lot of plans have been made around it. Ever since the autumn, Downing Street has thought of little else. Next week's Budget is the centrepiece, nicely calibrated for instant political effect. Mr Blair has a reshuffle he wants to make, a reorgani sation of Whitehall that is far advanced on paper, a whole new tranche of progressive optimism that awaits release once the dreaded hurdle to the second term has been successfully negotiated. There's also the little matter of the euro. An election that had to be delayed until the autumn would postpone further the most time-sensitive battle of the next parliament. All this has been schemed rigorously into place. So has the imminent slaughter of William Hague.Who knows what might happen in the uncharted territory between spring and autumn? Perhaps Hague could find an issue. Maybe the petrol blockaders would strike again. With all summer to debate it, the hunting bill could no longer be kicked into the post-electoral grass. The Countryside Alliance would hold its dreaded march. Such are the interventions of chance, time and fortune that May 3 is perfectly calculated to minimise. Reckonings like this are always a bit of an insult to the electorate. They show how heavily biased the British system is against elections called for the benefit of the people, rather than for the benefit of the prime minister and his party. We live with this. But now we won't do so with indifference. Foot and mouth has blown the gaff. The prime intention of ministers is still to call an election which nobody except them needs, even if, as would in certain circumstances be possible, the consequence was to disconnect from the campaign just about as many rural voters as the number of blacks the governor of Florida disenfranchised in Dade County last November. For life to return to a semblance of normality after the foot-and-mouth disaster, the country needs to be free of any more cases anywhere for a fortnight after the last case is discovered. For an election to be called before that fortnight is up would risk the campaign being held while further outbreaks were flaring. For a May 3 election, the best-guess date on which Mr Blair needs to announce it is March 26. Knock a fortnight off that, and you get a date adjacent to 10 days from now. The government hasn't got long to kill foot and mouth - nor, also, to make up its mind about what its democratic priorities really are. There are utilitarian reasons why it should already be preparing to reverse them. Insisting on the date would put turnout further at risk than it already is, albeit mainly in seats that Labour may not expect to win. A campaign fought when half the country has barely recovered from paralysis would not be much fun. It would also seem like another Labour insult to the rural population: blundering on with a premature once-in-five-year democratic opportunity, without regard to the voters all over Devon and Somerset and Cumbria and Northumberland and Hereford and wherever else the pyres are burning. But there's a bigger reason for riding with the punches from on high. Democracy should be about more than cynical calculation. Forcing the country to go through an exercise it's in no condition to enjoy would be one more way of feeding the apathy and distaste for politics Mr Blair spends quite a lot of time railing against. Barring a miracle, he should already be looking at June. More likely, autumn would seem to be the ticket. There'd be no harm in legislating to change the fixed-term elections we do have, the locals, to get away from May 3 as well. The same reasons apply. I don't believe the result will be much different from what it would have been if there'd been no plague, and the six-month blueprint had been kept to. Recent evidence continues to suggest that the more the Tories talk, the deeper they plunge into incoherence and contradiction. But the voters would not have been so presumed on, so coldly manipulated as accessories to their masters' schemes. If there's any silver lining in foot and mouth, it should be the recognition by politicians that they can't always control democracy, any more than natural catastrophe. hugoyoung@compuserve.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
