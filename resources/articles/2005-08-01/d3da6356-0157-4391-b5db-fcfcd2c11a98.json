Should they spend their summers within the British Isles, and gamble on being eaten by mako sharks off the Cornish coast, or risk an interminable wait for a flight lying prostrate outside WH Smith at London Heathrow? Global warming looks like tipping the balance in favour of staying home. Latest reports predict that heatwaves in Britain will soon be biennial events, so that holidaymakers, with a few changes in their habits, could enjoy Mediterranean breaks right here. But is Britain ready to make the transition to cafe society that our High Court judges, more concerned with binge drinking, would like to see? Writing in this section today, French journalist Agnes Poirier attempts to tutor us in her countrymen's approach to alcohol consumption which involves, among other tricks such as sitting down, much philosophising between sips of sancerre.
