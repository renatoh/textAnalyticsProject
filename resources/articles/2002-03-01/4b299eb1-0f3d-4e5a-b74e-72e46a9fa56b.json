A number of union officials complained yesterday that Mr Monks was in danger of taking their support for granted by having made it clear he wanted to be succeeded by his lieutenant. Although none would criticise Mr Monks in public, the private concern underlined uneasiness over his decision to swap Congress House, the TUC HQ, for Brussels by putting his name forward next year to be elected general secretary of the European TUC. One official suggested the TUC should use the opportunity to jump a generation and pick its first woman leader, and identified Frances O'Grady, the TUC's head of organisation, as a possible candidate. Others predicted that Mr Barber, 51, would easily secure the votes of the bigger unions and win any ballot in 2003. Mr Barber is an accomplished operator and has similar politics to Mr Monks, favouring partnership with employers and the government over confrontation. \"The fix is on for the fixer,\" said one leftwinger. \"It'll be back into the smoke-filled rooms.\" The departure of Mr Monks next summer after 10 years at the top of the TUC would deprive Tony Blair of his most influential union ally at a point when government-union relations are likely to be severely strained. A proponent of Mr Barber said he offered the best prospect of continuity, having played an important role in securing the minimum wage and employment rights. Mr Monks, a leading light in the pro-euro lobby, recently denounced Mr Blair as \"bloody stupid\" after the prime minister allied himself with Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian premier, to oppose further European employment initiatives. Mr Monks insisted, however, that a Labour government remained the best option for the trade unions. \"We have got points of tension and difference with the government, but I am clear that in my time as general secretary of the TUC the best thing that has happened for workers and trade unions was the election of Tony Blair's government in 1997,\" Mr Monks told BBC radio yesterday. He said he had been canvassed by international colleagues to put his name to replace Emilio Gabaglio at the ETUC when he retires next year. By making his plans public Mr Monks must be confident of success, and recently he moved his family home out of London to south Wales. 10 years at the top DoB \u00b7 5.8.45, Manchester Education \u00b7 Ducie technical high school, Manchester \u00b7 BA in economics at Nottingham University Career \u00b7 Management trainee with electronics group Plessey, 1967-69 \u00b7 Joined TUC 1969 \u00b7 Head of department 1977-87 \u00b7 Deputy general secretary 1987-93 \u00b7 General secretary since 1993 \u00b7 Member of the council of government's Acas mediation service 1979-95, and of the economic and social research council1988-91 Highs \u00b7 Forecasting a new era of industrial relations after recognition agreements for unions tripled to 470 last year \u00b7 Obtaining the minimum wage, though failed to get \u00a34.10 adult rate for 21-year-olds \u00b7 In 2000, coming in at a respectable 256 in Observer's list of 300 people who hold the reins of power in Britain Lows \u00b7 Being unable to change what he refers to as Tony Blair's half hearted support for the euro, and complaining that ministers often treat unions like \"an embarassing elderly relative\" \u00b7 Being unable to halt decline in manufacturing, with total union membership falling to 6.7m due to loss of such jobs Recreations \u00b7 Squash, gardening, music"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
