The implication of his argument is that Scotland should have a new British mission - to sacrifice forever our right of self-determination simply to stop the English getting the government they vote for. Freedland believes that \"English votes for English laws could see a Conservative grip on the English public realm that will be near-impossible to loosen\". I can understand the concern; after all Scotland suffered at the hands of a Tory government for 18 long years. But we didn't vote for it! There is nothing new in his remarks - they crop up from time to time on the English left as they try to justify self-determination for every nation except the one on England's northern border. If I were to give progressive England some advice, it would not be to cling on to the union at Scotland's expense, but instead campaign for proportional representation and fair votes for the English. Freedland's musings say more about the state of Labour than the state of the union. If the Labour party is losing the argument in England - as it is to the SNP in Scotland - then that is something it, not Scotland, needs to sort out. Progressive England expects too much if they want us to save the political skin of Mr Blair or Mr Brown. And progressive England would do well not to give the impression, as Freedland does, that England has no right to self-determination just because it might come up with an answer he finds unwelcome. The task is not to deny England self-government, but to seek to change the minds of the people. A rallying cry for the British state is all well and good, but the weakness of Freedland's argument is exposed by the very words he uses. Britain is \"pulled apart\", we are heading towards the \"abolition of the UK\", and hapless David Cameron is accused of trying to \"tear our country apart\". He has adopted the same tired language of the old Tory unionists. How about equal nations, working in partnership and making the right decisions about their future? And when he claims \"we are stronger as one decent-sized country, standing together, than we would be as four smaller countries\": tell that to Norway, Ireland, Finland or Denmark, just a few of the European nations sitting at the top of world league tables for wealth and quality of life and playing their full part in the UN and EU. Indeed, having a population of less than 10 million is the ideal size, with the richest seven European nations coming in below this mark. Anyone who suggested Ireland would be better served being represented once again by big Britain would be laughed out the room - in Dublin or Brussels. Yes, there are difficult questions for England raised by the creation of a Scottish parliament; and, yes, the Tories \"have come up with the wrong answer\". But the only fair way ahead is independence, for both Scotland and England, so we can work together in a new partnership of equals. Gone will be England's surly lodger, and in its place a new and very friendly neighbour. \u00b7 Alex Salmond MP is leader of the Scottish National party alex.salmond@snp.org The Response column offers those who have been written about in the Guardian an opportunity to reply.
