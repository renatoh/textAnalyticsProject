This is where not supersizing is a bonus. Never be lured by special offers and buy only the smallest you can find to satisfy the yearn, and preferably just one small bar at a time. Because once you\u2019ve breached the protocol of ripping open one small bar after another, there will be no stopping you. I like Willie\u2019s Cacao (from \u00a31.99) small bars for this, although at 50g they\u2019re about as big as you should go and the milkiest low they hit is 44%, which may not be treat enough for you. Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose both have teeny bars that can sate at 30-35g, and they come in all manner of worthiness. Pump Street excels here at 20g minis (\u00a39.60 for four), but stockists are highly selective. Pounce when you see them. My new favourites, however, are more selective still (only via mail at the moment so pre-planning is necessary): Tosier\u2019s 10g micro-batch tinies (\u00a38 for four). I mean what is 10g of chocolate? Thus far only in 70% or 90% cocoa content (more coming though), the bars are exquisite Sylvanian Family-sized: two, sealed and dosage-controlled in a foil packet. But so flavoursome (the Monmouth Coffee Company version is the best coffee-chocolate I\u2019ve ever tasted), even if you don\u2019t usually like 70% chocolate I implore you to try them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
