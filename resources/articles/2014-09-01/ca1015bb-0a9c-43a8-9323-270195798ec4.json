The lineup includes brass, fiddle, accordion, harmonica, standup bass and guitar, and their influences range from New Orleans Mardi Gras styles to gospel, folk-blues and rockabilly, with Balkan gypsy brass added in. They are furiously energetic and versatile, switching from the witty honky-tonk story of a reformed low-life, Pipe &amp; Slippers Man, to a bleak narrative ballad, Loretta\u2019s Revenge, featuring Mexican-influenced brass, through to the bluesy Latin pop of Jimmy Cuba, or a stomping gospel piece, Help Me Jesus, on which Wilko Johnson adds guitar and vocals. Their main problem, as well as main asset, is singer-songwriter Paul-Romney Angel, who tackles his intriguing songs in an over-theatrical style. If he calmed down he would sound more exciting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
