Canada will not have one professional player in their line-up and their budget of \u00a3150,000 to prepare for the World Cup is the equivalent of what a single experienced All Black player earns in a year. The gap between the haves and have-nots is increasing at a worrying rate. With most of the income generated each year by the sport being shared among the leading eight nations, the professional era is squeezing out the lesser nations. The giants are getting bigger, faster, fitter - and richer. Samoa, who announced their arrival in the 1991 World Cup by defeating Wales at Cardiff Arms Park, are talking of stopping playing internationals after the World Cup because they have no money and because most of their promising young players are lured to Australia or New Zealand, picked to play sevens or an A international, and denied to their homeland for life. \"The Australian and New Zealand unions have raped and pillaged the South Sea Islands for many years,\" said the Tonga coach Jim Love, who played for the New Zealand Maori. \"Scouts sit on the sidelines at schoolboy matches and offer the best players scholarships to prestigious schools. There is nothing we can do about it.\" The New Zealand wing Joe Rokocoko, who has scored eight tries in eight internationals, was born in Fiji. \"Our players leave for Australia and New Zealand as soon as they can,\" said Charlie Chartres, a member of the Fijian Rugby Union. \"They can earn at least \u00a315,000 a season playing provincial rugby, a sum we cannot match. The big unions do well out of television, but we do not get a cent from that source. We make more money selling programmes.\" The International Rugby Board hopes to make a profit of more than \u00a350m from this World Cup, money it will disperse in the next four years between its 95 members. It made \u00a345m in 1999 and has this year provided grants of more than \u00a39m but the Canada coach David Clark does not believe it is anywhere near enough. \"The eight second-tier countries should be given $1m a year to be spent on player development,\" he said. \"It was the way we started in Australia in the 1980s and that sort of money would make a huge difference to a country like Canada. We were competitive in World Cups in 1991 and 1995 when the game was amateur but we are now living hand to mouth.We need regular competition. I would like to see the IRB create an annual competition for the likes of Canada, the USA, Uruguay and the island unions.\" The IRB's development officer Geoff Evans said: \"We recognise something has to be done otherwise the doomsday scenario is that our World Cup will become like the rugby league one, with only a couple of sides capable of winning it. What the leading unions have to realise is that the normal competition rules of business, where you look to drive your rivals into the ground, does not apply in sport. \"The more countries capable of winning a World Cup the more profitable it is for the game as a whole, but it is a balancing act. The top nations need more money to pay their players while the second- and third-tier countries need finance for their development; it is a case of keeping both happy.\" \"We have no chance against New Zealand,\" said Clark. \"Like is not playing like. In 1991, we lost 29-13 to the All Blacks in the quarter-final. I know there will not be a repeat of that, but I would be delighted if we scored 13 points again.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
