I saw a statistic the other day which showed that I'm averaging more than 40 in one-day internationals in England, which was quite heartening, but everybody knows that I need to kick on more often when I get a decent start to the innings. That comes down to how well we play the middle overs and it is something that most people agree England have not excelled at for a while. I've been trying to tap into Andy Flower's knowledge since he joined our coaching staff. There were few better manipulators of the ball in mid-innings than Andy and, although he is left-handed, I'm sure there is a lot I can learn from him. One-day cricket in the middle overs is about working the ball into areas that disturb the opposition's plans. It is about moving the field where you want it to be so that you can then score in the areas you feel more comfortable in. It can require an element of risk, but most of all it involves assessing the situation of the game and playing the right shot at the right time. Keeping a calculating mind, either when the pressure is on, or even when the game is drifting along a little, is essential. I'm sure that knowledge comes with experience, but Andy talks a lot of sense and I'm sure he can help to quicken the learning process. Three of us - myself, Ravi Bopara and Owais Shah - took the chance to take a look at India's one-day attack when I played for England Lions at Northampton. I suppose it will look to some as if we were playing for our place, but it didn't really feel like that. I didn't have any cricket for Warwickshire and it was an opportunity to look at their two spinners, Ramesh Powar and Piyush Chawla, who I didn't know too much about. I'm sure they will both figure quite prominently as the series progresses, but the Lions played them well, with both going for more than 50. Three of the seven ODIs are day-nighters and attitudes have changed slightly towards floodlit cricket in England. At the outset, it was commonly agreed that you had to bat first if you won the toss and avoid batting under lights. There was a suspicion around at the time that batting under floodlights was only slightly preferable to playing blindfold. Now teams fancy the challenge more of batting under lights. Instead of fearing the twilight, an increasing number of people argue that the ball skids on a little more when the dew comes down and so makes scoring easier on slow pitches. Add that to the fact that batsmen are more attuned to batting under floodlights and these days it is a less straightforward decision. I didn't make the cut for the Twenty20 World Cup which was disappointing. Peter Moores told me that England want me to concentrate on Test and 50-overs cricket, but I want to push myself in all forms of the game. I've improved as a Test player in the past two years so it's fair to suppose that my 20-overs game will also have improved. I see myself as someone who likes to play more orthodox shots than inventive ones, so perhaps people view that as more suitable to the longer formats. This country sees more Twenty20 cricket than anywhere in the world, but that advantage does not filter through to England players because the international calendar makes it impossible for us to take part. I was injured when we played two Twenty20s against West Indies so I haven't played this form of cricket since I managed a game for Warwickshire two years ago. That makes it difficult to press my case for selection. It used to be argued that one-day cricket could ruin a Test player's technique. These days, we have all had to adapt. Twenty20 might not teach you much about how to bat in Test cricket, but it can enhance your 50-overs game. It puts you under pressure from the outset, and narrows things down to the crunch part of the game. I want to be playing it. Even without a Twenty20 World Cup, there should still be plenty to keep me occupied this winter. The Sri Lanka one-day series follows at the end of September, and there is only one warm-up game, so it will be important to join this tour with some batting form behind me. I'll be available for Warwickshire, and hoping they pick me this time. There is a possibility I might walk straight into a relegation struggle in the championship so I hope I can do my bit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
