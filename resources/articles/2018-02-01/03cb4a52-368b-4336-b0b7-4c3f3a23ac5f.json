Farrell has not participated in the squad\u2019s more physical sessions since the hard-fought win over Wales but is expected to prove his fitness on Thursday before the team fly north. The England management are insisting all will be fine even though the Lions midfielder once again played a reduced part in Tuesday\u2019s training watched by the visiting football coaches Stuart Pearce, Hope Powell and Mark Warburton. \u201cOwen is good,\u201d said Neal Hatley, England\u2019s scrum coach. \u201cHe\u2019s been doing an extra bit of reconditioning but he\u2019s good to go. \u201cHe\u2019ll train with us on Thursday and has been involved with the group outdoors this week. It\u2019s about doing what we need to do to get the individual specifically right for the weekend. If that means we tailor what we do in the training then we do it to make sure we hit the ground running. We have a clean bill of health so everyone is available for selection.\u201d The West Ham manager David Moyes had been due to watch Tuesday\u2019s session but the Scot ultimately could not attend. Eddie Jones will instead visit West Ham at a later date to continue his search for potentially valuable training tips from other sports. England\u2019s matchday squad is set to include Nathan Hughes and Joe Marler for the first time in the tournament, both of whom will be expected to challenge Scotland physically. \u201cIn that last 25 minutes against France, Scotland were anything but flaky or fragile,\u201d said Hatley. \u201cPhysicality will be important for us. We\u2019ll look to make sure we do well in the collisions and go from there.\u201d England have also named two extra forwards, Wasps\u2019 James Haskell and Bath\u2019s Charlie Ewels, in a 25-man travelling squad, with the starting XV to be confirmed on Thursday. They will not, however, request that Welsh referee Nigel Owens keeps a specific eye out for Scottish prop Simon Berghan scrummaging on his knees. \u201cIf he\u2019s got a tendency to drop you\u2019ve got to force him on to his knees to make it clear for the ref,\u201d said Hatley. \u201cIf he picks it up he picks it up.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
