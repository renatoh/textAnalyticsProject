Regular exercise and an active life are thought to help prevent or delay dementia, and some small studies have been done in dementia patients with positive results. But a trial found that gym exercise did nothing to slow down the progress of the disease. \u201cI was disappointed by the results, although I probably wasn\u2019t completely surprised,\u201d said Prof Sarah Lamb, lead author of a paper in the British Medical Journal. \u201cI think it would be fair to say that dementia is a difficult problem to fix,\u201d said Lamb, who works at the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences at Oxford University. Nearly 500 people with dementia volunteered to join the trial, and of those 329 were assigned to a serious physical fitness regime, while 165 had usual care. Those allocated to four months of physical exercise, which was personalised according to their fitness, did two gym sessions a week lasting 60 to 90 minutes, involving exercise such as cycling on static bikes and using dumb bells and weight belts. They were also asked to do a further hour a week at home. The study was approved and funded by the National Institute for Health Research, which tests interventions that might be of use to the NHS. But the researchers found that \u201cthis level of specialist exercise doesn\u2019t work\u201d, Lamb said. The results showed, in fact, that those who carried out the exercise programme had worse cognitive scores \u2013 a measurement of their thinking and rationalising abilities \u2013 than those who did not. It made them physically fitter, which was helpful in their daily life, but it did not slow down the progress of the disease. That should not stop people with dementia going for walks, swimming or doing other sorts of gentle activities, said Lamb. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to alarm members of the public with dementia and their families. We used a very specialised exercise programme. We know that gentle exercise is good for you. We don\u2019t want people to stop what they are doing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you think of exercise as a drug, it is certainly not worth the NHS investing in that type of treatment for people.\u201d Dr Brendon Stubbs, research physiotherapist at King\u2019s College London, said the results are enormously important for people with dementia and the NHS. \u201cThe search for effective lifestyle interventions that can delay cognitive decline in dementia must continue,\u201d he said. Rob Howard, professor of old age psychiatry at UCL, said the negative results were also important. \u201cAlthough this was only a tiny worsening in cognitive functioning that wouldn\u2019t have been noticeable in an individual patient, it was statistically significantly different from the outcome seen in those who didn\u2019t exercise. \u201cDespite its small size, I am sure that \u2013 had this been instead an improvement in cognitive functioning with exercise \u2013 we would all have been excited about finding something positive in the, so far, depressing fight against dementia. On this basis, I don\u2019t think we should ignore the possibility that exercise might actually be slightly harmful to people with dementia.\u201d A second study, published in the JAMA Psychiatry journal, showed that people with lower incomes have a higher risk of dementia than those who are well off. Researchers from University College London looked at data on 6,000 adults born between 1902 and 1943 and found that the 20% most deprived adults were 50% more likely to develop dementia than the 20% least deprived adults. \u201cOur study confirms that the risk of dementia is reduced among well-off older people compared with those who have fewer economic resources,\u201d said Professor Andrew Steptoe, senior author of the study. \u201cMany factors could be involved. Differences in healthy lifestyle and medical risk factors are relevant. It may also be that better off people have greater social and cultural opportunities that allow them to remain actively engaged with the world.\u201d Neither education nor physical health accounted for the results, said Dr Sara Imarisio, Head of Research at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK. \u201cSocioeconomic status is closely intertwined with many different aspects of lifestyle, so unpicking the underlying cause of the relationship highlighted by this research is extremely difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cThe findings suggest that people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds may benefit most from advice about how to reduce dementia risk, and this is something that the health service, charities, and government agencies should consider in future public health campaigns.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
