On Wednesday night Henry was seen by millions of TV viewers \u2013 but not, alas, by the match referee \u2013 creating the winning goal for his country against Ireland with the help of a deliberate handball, in the process ensuring that the French and not the Irish would compete at next summer's World Cup. \u2022 Richard Williams: Henry let himself and game down \u2022 In video: Barry Glendenning on Henry's handball \u2022 David Hytner: Trapattoni gives Irish hope for the future \u2022 In pictures: the best of the World Cup play-off action Rarely can one man's act of sporting misconduct have brought such a concerted and diversely qualified chorus of disapproval upon his head. So much so that the incident already known as La Main de Dieu (in homage to Diego Maradona's Hand of God goal against England in 1986) or, increasingly, Henrygate, had by this afternoon mutated into the most fevered sporting brouhaha in recent memory and something close to an international incident. Today Henry stands accused by figures as diverse as the Irish justice minister, Dermot Ahern, who has made an apparently futile request to have the match replayed, and the French teachers' union, which issued a statement intoning: \"The France team will go to South Africa courtesy of unquestionable cheating which highlights the downward spiral affecting football today.\" Even allowing for the inflammatory nature of his crime, the level of vitriol directed at Henry over an incident of handball is unprecedented. The state-of-the-art nature of its dissemination might have something to do with it. Initial reactions arrived on Wednesday night via the standard platforms: accusatory post-match interviews and baleful newspaper comment. Waking up this morning Henry might, just about, have fancied he'd got away with it. By lunchtime it was clear that larger forces were at work; and that by a perfect storm of new technology, a highly visible injustice, and perhaps also Henry's own irresistible status as France's charismatic captain and leader, something much broader, and initially internet-driven, was in train. By lunchtime today a Facebook page entitled \"We Irish hate Thierry Henry (the cheat)\" had 34,000 registered followers. Comments on the page ranged from the unrepeatably abusive to the merely abusive and the \u2013 very occasionally \u2013 conciliatory. Twitter was swamped by a violent unspooling of anti-Henry bile, ranging from \"just had lunch in a cafe with a picture of Thierry Henry on the wall - almost spat my gnocchi out\" to \"Thierry henry est wack\" and its endless variations. Topics raised included the feasibility of a boycott of Gillette razors (one of Henry's personal endorsements) and an incitement to lodge formal protests to the French embassy in Dublin. Henry's Wikipedia entry was repeatedly defaced, and eventually locked. Even within the hermetically sealed world of professional football, where Henry is revered for his talent and personal magnetism, there were mutterings. His former team-mate Lee Dixon described the handball as an act of dishonesty and something that would \"taint his reputation\". Henry admitted his guilt almost immediately, even while attempting to transfer blame to the referee. \"I will be honest, it was a handball,\" he said after the match. \"But I'm not the ref. I played it, the ref allowed it. That's a question you should ask him.\" This morning a post on Henry's own Twitter page seemed to offer something closer to an apology. \"I'm not the referee,\" he tweeted as the net raged around him. \"But if I hurt someone im sorry.\" The hitherto very popular Henry would hardly have counted himself among the stand-out candidates for the role of international hate figure and the first great sporting fall-guy of the social networking website nexus. Between 1999 and 2007 he played with great distinction for Arsenal in the Premier League. He became known for his humour and charm and was the star of a series of popular car adverts that required no more of him than to slouch around looking handsome and occasionally saying the words \"va va voom\". He also has a reputation as a champion of good causes, a Unicef ambassador and anti-racism campaigner. The Henry persona is also something of a commercial concern. In 2006 the consultancy firm BBDO Germany listed him as the ninth most marketable footballer in the word and his fortune of over \u00a321m has been inflated by sponsorship deals with Renault, Nike, Reebok, Gillette and Pepsi. It seems too early to suggest his brand value might be permanently dimmed, but then nothing quite like this has ever happened before. Gillette said today it had no plans to sack him. \"Gillette are not placed to comment on any refereeing decisions made in the match \u2026 This is not going to affect our relationship with Thierry Henry,\" the company said. The Football Association of Ireland and the manager, Giovanni Trappatoni, are calling for Wednesday's match to be replayed, although there is little prospect of this happening. And while the player himself will be hoping the storm passes quickly he might not be through the worst yet. By lunchtime today a Facebook page called \"Let's get over the Henry thing and move on with our lives!!!\" had already appeared. By tea-time it had six subscribers. Over at \"We Irish hate Thierry Henry (the cheat)\" they were approaching 50,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
