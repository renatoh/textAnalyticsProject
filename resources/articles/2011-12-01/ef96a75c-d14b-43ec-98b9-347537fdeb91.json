The price of sentencing one person to death could instead be spent on: \u2022 A year's salary for 52 police officers in New Orleans - the city with the highest murder rate in the US. \u2022 Two new fire trucks in Texas, where Rick Perry cut the budget used to fight wild fires and asked for federal money instead. \u2022 A refund for 6,333 City University of New York students of their $300 fee hike imposed after cuts in state and city funding. \u2022 Paying to rehire 46 teachers laid off in Detroit during the latest budget crisis and mass redundancies. \u2022 Buying health insurance for 1,400 uninsured American families. California has the most expensive death penalty system of any state in the US. With 721 people on death row but only 13 executions since 1978, the state has spent $4bn more than it would have if the punishment were not available there. In cash-strapped Caliornia that would pay for: \u2022 The $3.6bn education cuts in the 2011-12 state budget, with millions to spare. \u2022 More than 1,700 extra crime investigators, over a 30-year career, in a state where 46% of homicides go unsolved. \u2022 The cost of community mental health services cut from the state budget - for the next 4.7 years. \u2022 Half the cost of a new high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and San Francisco."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
