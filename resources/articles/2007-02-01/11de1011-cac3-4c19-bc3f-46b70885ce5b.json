Who would have thought ITV would do a Swingers-meets-Beetlejuice comedy/drama thingummy? Bring more of it on, I say! badlydubbedboy \u00b7 Great TV. Bonkers ... well is Bonkers, stop over analysing it and enjoy it. As for Benidorm, it was laugh-out-loud comedy which has gone down a storm in the office. Well done ITV! jrjr \u00b7 I'm afraid I found Bonkers as appealing as an anal probe administered by Mark Addy. I'm a fan of Sally Wainwright's writing, but the woman needs some new ideas. Every character and every scene was a steal from At Home With The Braithwaites. And as for her treatment of the subject matter ... it was all so old-fashioned, low farce and infantile. Yuk! oniongravy \u00b7 My name is Pretty Boy Actor. I had an accident and I woke up in Liza Tarbucks's house. Am I mad? In a coma? Or trapped in an ITV comedy drama? Whatever the reason, it's like I'm on a different planet. Now maybe if I can find the reason, I can get home. minke \u00b7 Of the two, I favour Bonkers. Benidorm was firmly stuck in the 80s, with deliberately unlikeable working-class caricatures. Bonkers at least has an interesting premise that could, if it is handled correctly, provide food for thought on the subject of mental illness, along with the farce that Wainwright is famed for. Pagey \u00b7 I wanted to like these two new programmes, I really did. Of the four pistons that drive my terrestrial Ford Escort of a TV, I wanted some reassurance that they'd sorted out the dodgy one, and that by today I'd be motoring. I'm not sure what genres these were supposed to fit into. Comedy, drama or comedy-drama. Bonkers (fnarr fnarr), however, mixed a sledge-hammer approach to comedy with a tired construct of poorly recycled relationship-drama, and ended up with dreadful farce. So far, the inclusion of the manifest unconscious of a \"dream-guy actor\" has been a pointless irrelevancy, but hopefully the device may become pertinent in subsequent episodes. Benidorm, I was convinced, was going to be brilliant. I arrived at that conclusion because, from the moment I heard the title, I was thinking Eldorado, and assumed it was going to be a deliberate spoof of the failed soap. In the end, I just didn't get it. I feel sad for my faulty channel and I feel sad for Michael, but I don't think either of these will make the grade. yeractual"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
