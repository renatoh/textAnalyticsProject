The set of files from the Margaret Thatcher Foundation reveal that Sir Bernard Ingham, nominally a civil servant rather than a Conservative party employee, gave her advice despite neutrality rules that banned him from doing so. In a note to the prime minister on \u201chow to play the media over the next couple of weeks\u201d before the campaign, he wrote: \u201cYou need to look after the Daily Mail (David English wants to interview you \u2013 and would like to be first to do so after you have declared an election).\u201d English was the paper\u2019s editor at the time. Ingham also offered a view of two rivals to the Mail. \u201cThe Daily Telegraph is to interview all the party leaders and publish their Q and A during the course of the campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cGeorge Jones and Simon Heffer have specifically asked to come and interview you. Whatever your views about Max Hastings you should not pass this up.\u201d Jones and Heffer were members of the Telegraph\u2019s political staff, while Hastings was the newspaper\u2019s editor for 10 years. The only other paper to feature in his plans is the Sun, which wanted her to answer readers\u2019 questions, he told her: \u201cThey recently did a similar interview with [Neil] Kinnock who came out of it very badly. They will treat you very well and you should do this.\u201d The files also show that Thatcher\u2019s most trusted adviser, her political secretary, Charles Powell, also a civil servant, told her the day after she won a historic third term in June 1987 not \u201cto put yourself through it again\u201d. \u201cThe level of personal abuse thrown at you during the campaign was unbelievable and must take some toll, however stoic you are outwardly,\u201d Powell wrote on Downing Street-headed paper in a \u201cstrictly personal\u201d note. He added: \u201cIt is not right you should be subjected to a further round like this time.\u201d Powell, speaking this week about the release of his 1987 letter for the first time in full, admitted it was an unusual one for a civil servant to send but said he had been distressed to observe at close quarters the stress of a third election campaign \u201cand the backbiting it involved on Margaret Thatcher\u2019s health and performance and wanted to discourage her, in her own interests, from any inclination to go \u2018on and on\u2019.\u201d He recalled discussing the letter with Thatcher, who had felt there was \u201cas yet no suitable successor to her, though several thought they were\u201d. Thatcher faced what she regarded as a bruising time from broadcasters, particularly Sir Robin Day and David Dimbleby, who both focused on her \u201cuncaring\u201d reputation, as she privately told the journalist Sir John Junor: \u201cAll the interviews I had seemed to me to be more belligerent, more discourteous, more insulting than any I ever remember \u2013 and I have been through a lot.\u201d But her private papers, held at Churchill College in Cambridge, also show how vulnerable Thatcher became during the campaign after losing the services of her two most trusted advisers, Powell and Ingham \u2013 owing to civil service impartiality rules \u2013 even if they continued to give her advice. They also underline how far she had to rely on the Conservative central office party machine that was so riven by fractious disputes between the party chairman at the time, Norman Tebbit, whom she no longer trusted, and her placeman, Lord Young. Tebbit\u2019s then chief of staff, Michael Dobbs, has said the situation inspired him to write his political thriller House of Cards. Thatcher biographer Charles Moore reveals that she repeatedly lashed out and exploded in anger during the campaign, even at one point, according to Dobbs, \u201cscreaming and foaming at the mouth\u201d. On \u201cwobbly Thursday\u201d \u2013 4 June 1987, when the Tories were spooked by a poll showing Labour closing the gap one week before the election \u2013 Moore even reports that Young grabbed Tebbit by the shoulders and said: \u201cNorman listen to me, we\u2019re about to lose this fucking election, you\u2019re going to go, I\u2019m going to go, the whole thing is going to go.\u201d The files contain one unsigned note from \u201c\u2018wobbly Thursday\u201d, which traced a general slide in the Conservatives\u2019 polling position over the whole campaign and reported that \u201cthe trend is now dangerous\u201d. The private papers confirm that the main dispute between Tebbit and Young was how to play the campaign. Young, backed by ad agency research, wanted an all-out attack on Labour\u2019s \u201cextremism\u201d, while Tebbit argued that the Tories had to give voters a positive reason to keep the party in power. The wobble was brought to an end by a Guardian/Marplan poll showing a 10-point lead which Tebbit gleefully reported to Thatcher: \u201cI believe this confirms our positive strategy is right. I believe the negative material which we asked Saatchi\u2019s to produce is not the best line. We need less about what life would be like under Labour and more about life under this government.\u201d As well as the note on managing the media, the files include two notes, entitled Election Analysis, written during the course of the campaign which are unsigned but bear Ingham\u2019s unmistakeable tone \u2013 \u201cwe should be having all the fun of the Eatanswill fair\u201d, one reads. The author notes that the aim of the Tory campaign \u201cshould be to destroy Labour\u2019s claim to be the caring party which its \u2018Chariots of Fire\u2019 commercials are designed to achieve\u201d. Kinnock\u2019s campaign had featured a party election broadcast directed by Hugh Hudson, the director of Chariots of Fire. The highly personalised broadcast was dubbed \u201cKinnock: The Movie\u201d. In the event Labour\u2019s campaign was to prove a \u201cmagnificent defeat\u201d, and Thatcher overcame her party\u2019s fractious campaign to win a historic third term with a reduced majority of 102."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
