This time he's up against reigning champion Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver): cue the traditional training montage before a brutal confrontation in the ring. Babel 7.35pm &amp; 12.10am, Sky Movies Indie (Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, 2006) A rifle is fired in Morocco, and the shockwaves reverberate through several families: Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are the middle-class American tourists at the centre of the storm, when the latter is badly wounded by the random bullet. The contrived plotting is hard to swallow, but it's a powerful drama that evokes a sense of the human condition. Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n 11.25pm, Film4 (Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, 2001) Julio and Tenoch are 17 and amazed when beautiful, unhappy young wife Luisa (Maribel Verd\u00fa) accepts their invitation to head out of Mexico City in search of a legendary beach. As the buddies (beautifully played by Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Diego Luna) become rivals in machismo for Luisa, their rite-of-passage slides into melancholy shadows."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
