Put the fire out. Put the fire out\u2019,\u201d says the Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes. \u201cI got to the end of the game and thought: \u2018I put the fire out.\u2019\u201d She is talking about Chelsea\u2019s Champions League quarter-final second leg at Paris Saint-Germain. After a 2-0 home win Chelsea conceded twice in Paris but they scored in the added time to secure their passage to Sunday\u2019s semi-final against Lyon, whose triumph in last season\u2019s competition was their fifth. \u201cAnything can happen, but you must remain in it. It could have been easy to capitulate when Ann\u2011Katrin Berger dropped that ball in against Paris. \u201cHostile atmosphere, you\u2019ve given a goal away straight after half-time, the second goal the goalkeeper\u2019s dropped the ball in her own net, or however it went in.\u201d They were heading for extra time until Maren Mjelde struck. \u201cYou ask her and she\u2019ll tell you,\u201d says Hayes, grinning. \u201cI asked her: \u2018Where did you get that from?\u2019 She said: \u2018I just knew I couldn\u2019t do extra time.\u2019\u201d Hayes\u2019s firefighting efforts only strengthened her mid-game mantra of no regrets. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to change things. I\u2019m not stubborn about tactics. Formations are merely numbers, it\u2019s all about space and who is hurting us where. That\u2019s how I view the game. \u201cParis was a performance I was prepared for because I\u2019ve been in that situation enough times to go: \u2018I\u2019m not going to let us lose the game. We can\u2019t keep the ball. We\u2019re horrendous in possession. I can\u2019t do anything about that but I can certainly slow them down somehow.\u2019\u201d That is what Hayes has to do against Lyon. Chelsea are \u201cnot delusional\u201d about the task in front of them. She leaps to her feet and gives an animated 15-minute Bielsa-esque rundown of how you try to handle the threat from front to back. It is a look inside the mind of a self-confessed \u201cmaniac\u201d: every proposition is considered, every movement agonised over. She is living this game every minute of every day. \u201cThey\u2019ve got full-backs that will hug the touchline. You\u2019ve got two centre-halves who will take risks. You\u2019ve got Kumagai, Henry and Fishlock, Marozsan who will play on the toes of the back four, and then two strikers.\u201d Those two strikers being the Ballon d\u2019Or winner, Ada Hegerberg, and the French forward Eug\u00e9nie Le Sommer, who have nine goals between them in six Champions League games this season. There are no weaknesses. \u201cWe have to acknowledge that they\u2019re the best and we have to acknowledge that we\u2019re not going to get a lot. But what I will say about my team is we always get an away goal. We have in Europe. We don\u2019t need a lot of chances in the Champions League \u2013 the league\u2019s a different conversation.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point where there\u2019s a lot of curiosity about Sunday. Everybody knows Lyon are the favourites, everybody expects Lyon to win, everybody expects Lyon to dominate, including Lyon, but as we saw last night [a reference to Manchester City v Tottenham in the men\u2019s Champions League] football isn\u2019t that simple.\u201d Hayes has been at Chelsea for almost seven years and a lot has changed. \u201cNot one chair in this building belonged to anyone in women\u2019s football when I first came here, let alone an office. Not a chair, not a desk, not a filing cabinet \u2013 and seven years on we now have the whole building.\u201d This is the game Hayes has been working towards for a long time, a lot longer than her seven years in south London. \u201cI still have a very strong relationship with Vic Akers,\u201d she says of the former Arsenal Women manager to whom Hayes was assistant during their historic quadruple-winning season. \u201cHe has always said to me that all you can do is put yourselves in the right position. For me I feel like this preparation began in 2006. \u201cWere Ume\u00e5 [whom Arsenal beat in the 2007 Champions League final] significantly better than Arsenal? Hell yeah. It\u2019s probably like the difference between Lyon and Chelsea now. A team with Marta, with young Ramona Bachmann, Hanna Ljungberg \u2013 unbelievable player she was. They had experience galore in their team and they were nailed-on favourites. \u201cBut as you saw with Tottenham [the men at Manchester City] you need some unbelievable moments to go your way, but it does happen. You need belief to do it, you certainly have to take your chances when they come round, as Tottenham did. \u201cWe\u2019re brave. I\u2019m brave. I\u2019ll do what I can to get my team to a position. I don\u2019t want to be changing my formation three times in a game [as she did against PSG], but I certainly won\u2019t get to the end of it and say: \u2018I wish I could have, should have done that. It will be the same on Sunday.\u201d United secure Championship with 7-0 pummelling of Palace Lauren James fired four goals as Manchester United clinched the Women\u2019s Championship title by thumping Crystal Palace 7-0. United had sealed promotion by thrashing Aston Villa 5-0 on Wednesday, but still needed one more win to claim the trophy. Casey Stoney\u2019s rampant side wasted little time securing the silverware, adding another runaway victory to a storming campaign. United have scored 88 goals in their 18 league games, conceding seven. James, Lizzie Arnot and Leah Galton struck as United took a 3-0 lead into the break. Jessica Sigsworth continued the scoring, before James pounced three times in succession."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
