The weather, for the last few days, has tasted more like spring than winter: grey curtains of cloud fling open to reveal windows of dazzling sunshine; big coat-flapping winds are chased by dogs of rain. There have been some frosts but nothing convincingly winterish. A north-eastern wind that brought snow to many parts of the country ran out of it before it reached here and raged emptily. The birds are picking up on all this energy in the air. A gang of jackdaws mobs a buzzard with renewed gusto. Raven pairs shout incomprehensible phrases as they crash around the sky above nesting sites. Tits, finches and wrens strike a sharp common note. Blackbirds and thrushes blurt out tiny fragments of song as if slowly recovering from amnesia. But nothing is settled. This is the flux of transition that has replaced the deep midwinter of old. A record crop of wild and garden berries have been stripped by flocks of fieldfares and redwings which arrived in autumn. Many of the blackbirds too come from northern Scandinavia, and they need to bulk up before the return journey in the coming months. A kind of agitation without shape is forming throughout the landscape as if some existential force is shaking each living thing from a short-lived torpor and freeing it to be itself. This waking-into-being has a kind of pain and a violence which rebels against the traditional patterning of the seasons. I wonder if, for many creatures, the absence of a longer period of activity-suspending winter might plunge them into a life accelerating towards death, a burnout. A flash of sunlight clears the air; the hills are etched blue and green against the sky. Dark clouds gather along the horizon, where rains will soon slip their leash again. The living are being chased by life and nothing is settled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
