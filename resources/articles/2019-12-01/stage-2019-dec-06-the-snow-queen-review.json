You\u2019ve got a strong team of actor-musicians, expertly led by Jeremy Bradfield with Dr G Hannabiell Sanders, and a rousing story about overcoming adversity. Why shouldn\u2019t you make all the noise you can? One reason is a tale that\u2019s magnificent in its quiet simplicity. The Snow Queen is the elemental story of childhood friends, Gerda and Kai, torn apart by dark adolescent temptation and reunited by the force of Gerda\u2019s love. Add noise and plot twists and you lose sight of what Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s story is about. \u201cIn the cold, you can hear every whisper,\u201d says Elizabeth Carter\u2019s Snow Queen in Mark Calvert\u2019s rowdy production. If only you could! With so much pulsing percussion and busy banjo, you long for silence. The noisiest song is called Hush Now \u2013 and it\u2019s not even ironic. Similarly reluctant to trust the source material, playwright Laura Lindow introduces a story of small-town repression. Now it\u2019s about the snow-averse citizens of Stifle reining in their emotions, Gilead-style (\u201cWishing and wanting are against the rules\u201d). It\u2019s a digression that delays the establishment of the central relationship (Lauren Waine and Gregor MacKay, both tremendous in the leads) and when finally Gerda\u2019s quest begins, her encounters with snow bees and a talking rose seem to come out of nowhere. Yes, it is colourful and, in the case of a War Horse-like reindeer, spectacular, but there is too much distraction. Instead of one girl\u2019s attempt to prevent the corruption of her soulmate, it becomes the fuzzily defined mission of a community to restore balance. Topical, in these divided times, but not what the story is about. At Northern Stage, Newcastle, until 4 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
