As a child she suffered physical and emotional abuse and severe neglect. The neglect had significant consequences, including a fractured skull from falling \u2013 which was only picked up when, after she vomited at school the next day, a member of her extended family intervened and took her to hospital. The emotional abuse included both parents telling her at different times that the other was dead, or that they weren\u2019t her real parents; the physical abuse \u2013 the hitting, the kicking \u2013 depended on their drug use and moods. \u201cIt was,\u201d the 36-year-old Sydneysider says now, \u201ca challenging journey through life. I never felt safe and I never felt grounded. You grow up hating yourself and thinking you caused it and you deserve it.\u201d Wondering if she\u2019d lose all her friends once they \u201cknew the truth\u201d, the usually articulate and witty writer withdrew. \u201cI knew it would impact how people thought about me and I was terrified,\u201d she admits. \u201cI began to doubt myself and believe no one would be interested, that someone might use it against me somehow.\u201d Delaney had always felt like she had two different selves: her secret, real self and a superficial, public persona cultivated to blend in. \u201cI want to hear my real voice because it\u2019s been silenced for 36 years.\u201d Her decision to post her story was inspired by a Guardian article about the widespread misdiagnosis of trauma survivors and her desire to educate people about trauma. She attributes internalised self-blame, hurtful reactions and dehumanising labels from professionals for why she kept silent so long. She first told her story to the daughter of a Christian family she was staying with as a teen and was reprimanded. At 18, she attempted suicide. The psychiatric registrar told her to do it properly next time. \u201cThat pushed me back into my shell for years,\u201d she says. Delaney, who suffers from complex post-traumatic stress disorder, says society treats different medical conditions unequally. \u201cOne of my old school friends had cancer a few years ago and everyone offered to help, while my emotional injuries are a source of shame and isolation.\u201d Many people have since shared their own secrets of abuse with Delaney. \u201cWhat broke my heart was it was all in private messages,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were too scared to share it openly. I want to take the power away from my abusers and the only power they have over me is my silence and shame. To adult survivors, don\u2019t let the fuckers who stole your joy keep stealing it even one more day.\u201d Kelly Humphries, a 37-year-old Queensland senior police constable, went to the police about her uncle\u2019s sexual abuse when she was 19, but she didn\u2019t speak publicly about it till her 30s. She has written a memoir, Unscathed Beauty, about her recovery. \u201cI want people to know they\u2019re not on their own,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much happens behind closed doors [that] nobody ever talks about. I\u2019ve always known since I was a child I didn\u2019t want it to happen to anyone else.\u201d Humphries, who worked in child protection for six years, first spoke out about her abuse at Toastmasters in 2015. \u201cIt was a bit controversial for them but I think they recognised the courage it took. It\u2019s hard to know how people are going to respond when you\u2019ve had an experience like that but I\u2019ve grown in the process of sharing and writing, reaching out to others and others reaching out to me.\u201d She recommends having a support system and good self-care practices when sharing traumatic information. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell everyone but it\u2019s important for the people who matter most in your life. People can\u2019t support you if they don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong.\u201d Disclosing has enabled others to share their stories, including her mother. \u201cShe revealed to me that it\u2019s happened to her as well. She hadn\u2019t spoken about it ever. All of a sudden, people start making disclosures and it doesn\u2019t become shameful any more.\u201d Dr Cathy Kezelman, president of the Blue Knot foundation, a national organisation helping adults recover from childhood trauma, says Australia\u2019s royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse had found it takes an average of 24 years for people to speak about their abuse. \u201cSome never do,\u201d she says. The Blue Knot helpline has received calls from people disclosing for the first time in their 70s, 80s and 90s. \u201cWe have a society that hasn\u2019t wanted to hear about it,\u201d she explains. \u201cAs we saw in the royal commission, a lot of people giving testimony spoke about trying to speak out as a child. Many were punished, they weren\u2019t believed and their concerns were dismissed or minimised. \u201cThinking about abuse or neglect of a child is inherently discomforting for us all. Often people hearing the disclosure don\u2019t know what to say. Counsellors with insufficient training, despite the best of intentions, can retraumatise victims.\u201d It takes a long time for victims to process and recognise what happened to them was abuse, Kezelman adds. \u201cThey are often abused by people supposed to care for them. Some people don\u2019t remember their abuse, or only parts of it. And often they haven\u2019t made connection between the struggles they\u2019re having in their life and what happened to them as a child.\u201d Mellita Bate, a manager and counsellor with Interrelate, provided support to victims coming forward to the royal commission. She says the insidious nature of the grooming process is behind why most people keep sexual abuse bottled up inside. The egocentric nature of children feeds into self-blame. \u201cMost perpetrators start touching just a little bit inappropriately to see if they can get away with it and to work out if that child has the capacity to tell an adult,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen they start to perpetrate the abuse they use threats and emotional blackmail.\u201d Another disincentive for disclosing abuse is the pain of reliving it. \u201cWe have in our human nature a way of dealing with trauma by just holding it locked away somewhere,\u201d Bate says. When people do disclose, it\u2019s for various reasons in different environments. Triggers, such as the #MeToo movement and royal commission, and the desire to obtain justice, are common motives for finally speaking out, she says. It\u2019s especially hard to disclose sex abuse if you\u2019re male. A 2014 paper by Sydney Law School found males are much less likely than females to disclose child sexual abuse at the time it occurs, take longer to disclose, and make fewer and more selective disclosures. Craig Hughes-Cashmore, chief executive of Survivors and Mates Survivors Network, a not-for-profit assisting male survivors of sex abuse, frames the discussion around gender stereotypes: \u201cWomen are victims and men are perpetrators; men don\u2019t cry; men don\u2019t seek help,\u201d he says. The added fear and confusion about sexual preference adds to their silence. \u201cThe bulk of perpetrators are male, so if you\u2019re a boy and are sexually abused by a same-sex person and you have a physical response, you\u2019re left very confused about your sexuality,\u201d he says. Hughes-Cashmore was himself abused as a child. It began in his early teens when his parents were going through a separation and a friend of his father\u2019s moved into the family home. \u201cHe was a friend and a work colleague of my father\u2019s,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it was nice to get that attention. My dad had met a new woman and my mum was freaking out. It kind of suited them for this guy to take an interest as well because they were trying to piece their lives together.\u201d Of his experience, he says \u201cyour own sexual development is taken from you and that\u2019s a really horrible legacy to be left with. We [survivors] didn\u2019t have that exploration thing kids talk about, the first kiss and that sort of stuff is denied, and I don\u2019t think we talk about that much but I think it really, really sucks if your first experience, like mine, is being raped.\u201d Apart from the destruction of natural sexual development there is the damage done to mental and emotional development. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about interrupting the development of the brain of a child and their education. It\u2019s a major rewiring of the brain that can often leave people in a perpetual state of alarm, a heightened sense of who\u2019s around me, what\u2019s happening and constant vigilance. I was like that for years and depressed and suicidal because the world wasn\u2019t safe, and everyone had an ulterior motive and who do you trust? \u201cTrust is a massive issue for people who\u2019ve been abused. Because often these people were people we looked up to and admired.\u201d More damaging than sexual confusion and a potent reason for long-held silence, says Hughes-Cashmore, is the abiding belief that victims are more likely to become sexual predators themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of demonising victims.\u201d Regardless of gender, associations with mental health instability and the view the victim didn\u2019t do enough to stop the abuse is another obstacle to potential sharing of the subject. \u201cThis shows a lack of understanding on the behalf of the public about the grooming process and the power imbalance between children and adults,\u201d Hughes-Cashmore says. Owing to their own sense of shame, many survivors expect judgment from society, he says. One man who found the strength to speak out is Adam Savage. The 40-year-old Newcastle resident was sexually abused by two older teenagers and a Catholic priest. It took him until he was 37 to reveal it. In 2016 Savage drove past his abuser\u2019s house with a friend. \u201cI said, \u2018That was the house where the two brothers abused me,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was really impulsive. I\u2019d completed enough healing where I found the inner strength to speak my truth.\u201d After that, Savage reported the abuse to police, then told family and friends. In 2017, as part of his healing and to get the perpetrators to confess their crime, he met them to ask why they had abused him. This resulted in them pleading guilty in court. Savage kept the abuse to himself for years owing to denial, guilt, shame, fear and trust issues. \u201cI didn\u2019t love myself and I didn\u2019t want to burden anybody else. I self-medicated with drugs, alcohol, sex and rugby.\u201d For Savage, speaking out has been about healing, justice, forgiveness and helping. \u201cI believe communication is key with all forms of trauma. The three individuals stole my power and it was time for me to get my power back. That will form my legacy \u2013 communicating and speaking my truth to empower others. This has been a long journey, a lot of hard work, many tears and a lot of inner reflection. I can honestly sit here right now and say I love myself from the heart for who I am.\u201d Hughes-Cashmore says: \u201cWe\u2019re just coming out of an age where this was incredibly taboo as a subject. People\u2019s response to disclosure is often key to people\u2019s recovery.\u201d A 2018 study found social support buffers the negative risks associated with child abuse including suicide, health problems in later life and a reduced lifespan. On the downside, Hughes-Cashmore reveals discrimination can be real for child abuse survivors. \u201cI\u2019ve helped men who have absolutely been discriminated against when their employer find out they\u2019re a survivor.\u201d Ultimately, the need to share oneself often prevails. As Blue Knot\u2019s Kezelman sums up: \u201cWe all want to be heard for who we are, survivors particularly, because it is so traumatic and has affected the trajectory of their life so incredibly.\u201d Helpful numbers and links in Australia Lifeline: 13 11 14 or chat online lifeline.org.au Blue Knot Foundation: 1300 657 380, Monday to Sunday, 9am-5pm AEST; blueknot.org.au Survivors &amp; Mates Support Network: 1800 4 SAMSN (72676), Monday to Friday, 9am-5pm; samsn.org.au Beyond Blue: 1300 224 636; beyondblue.org.au/forums Mensline Australia: 1300 789 978; mensline.org.au Interrelate: 1300 473 528, Monday to Friday, 9am-5pm; interrelate.org.au Other helpful numbers In the UK, the NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.
