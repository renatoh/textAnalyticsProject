Officials blamed a \"terrorist group\" for the massive explosion that ripped through the Shia Ali Ebne-Abitaleb mosque in Zahedan, capital of the volatile Sistan-Baluchestan province in eastern Iran. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Sistan-Baluchestan, bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, has been the site of repeated attacks linked to Jundallah, a Sunni insurgency group which Iran claims is backed by Washington, although the US denies this. The blast happened when the mosque was filled with worshippers. Some local media reports put the death toll at up to 30, with between 60 and 80 injured. The semi-official Fars news agency reported that security forces found and defused a second bomb in Zahedan. Sistan-Baluchestan's governor, Ali Mohammad Azad, said the attack was carried out by one person, but was organised by a \"terrorist group\" operating from Pakistan and Afghanistan. \"This group intended to use the insecure conditions in Afghanistan and Pakistan as the country prepares to hold its presidential election. They planned to carry out other terrorist activities in other provinces,\" he told Iran's state broadcaster IRIB. The attack came as Iran is gearing up for an election on 12 June in which Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the president, faces three challengers. The country's last presidential election campaign in 2005 was also marred by explosions that left several people dead. The latest incident came just days after Iran hosted a summit with leaders from Pakistan and Afghanistan aimed at combating terrorism and drug trafficking. Sistan-Baluchestan, on a drug transit route from Afghanistan, has seen many clashes between smugglers and Iranian security forces in which nearly 4,000 soldiers and police officers have died since 1979. This year Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, cited alleged US backing for Jundallah in his sceptical response to a televised message sent by Barack Obama calling for a new relationship between Tehran and Washington."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
