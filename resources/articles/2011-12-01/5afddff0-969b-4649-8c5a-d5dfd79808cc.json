She is a funny and articulate woman in her early 30s who volunteered for an interview, writing: \"I am a female financial journalist working in London. I have worked my way up to the position of head of bond coverage over the last decade in a company dominated by men.\" She orders a glass of white wine, then another one. \"I went to a shit comprehensive school, I am not white, I got a first-class degree and now I earn decent money and help run a successful business. That's the world of finance for you, it doesn't matter how you look or where you come from. It's about what you can do. \"Our work sits somewhere between journalism and an industry publication. We follow the bond market, announcing deals and auctions, then publish analyses of them. We write about the business done by people who pay us for that service. So there's a different dynamic than in mainstream journalism. At the same time we do work like journalists; checking facts, teasing out information. \"There's a great level of trust between players in the bond market and us, the industry press. If we hear about an upcoming deal, we call the banker in charge for confirmation. Occasionally he'll tell us: look it's true but don't publish it yet. And we don't. We may get asked by other bankers about this same deal and we tell them, yes it's happening but we're not putting it out yet. There's a lot of banter back and forth. We get fed rumours all the time. These days it's brutal out there, and we get calls from brokers sticking the boot in about certain deals: 'We hear they are struggling.' \"Everybody knows everybody in the bond market, it's a community. The coverage about the bond market in the mainstream press \u2026 basically we ignore them as they have very little inside knowledge. The only time they impact our work is when they fuck up and create misunderstandings or worse. This happens. \"That would be the number one taboo in my work: putting out information that is wrong. If we did that, within five minutes we'd get a million phone calls. When clients see something published by us, they must be sure it's correct. That's the business model. \"How the bond market works. Companies, countries, banks, development agencies, football clubs \u2026 they all need money. Either to do something new, or because an earlier loan or bond has 'matured' \u2013 when you borrow money it's usually for a definite period, often five or 10 years. After that you need to pay back the loan. So what you do when your loan 'matures', you take out a new one. This is what's called refinancing or 'rolling over' debt. \"So a company, country etc needs to borrow money, or as we call it, 'issue debt'. First they let investment banks pitch which one gets to do it. Usually the borrower (company, country etc) will chose a consortium of banks, as each brings its own network of relationships with investors to the table. If you're a European company issuing dollar debt in the US, you'd pick American banks for the American network, and then UK and continental banks for the European share. A UK company issuing debt in pound sterling would generally choose British banks for their domestic investor network. \"So this consortium of banks gets the so-called 'mandate'. Now there are two possibilities. If the company, country etc is well established, the bank will field investor calls to gauge interest in the bond, how much demand they can garner on what terms. On the basis of that they will determine an initial 'price' or 'spread' for the bond; basically what the interest or yield is going to have to be to interest enough investors \u2013 mind you I am simplifying, there are more intermediate steps. \"The other possibility is that the country, company etc is a relative newcomer to the bond market. In that case the mandated banks may do a 'roadshow', meaning they do a kind of a tour to introduce the country, company etc to investors, proving its creditworthiness. That's right, countries do roadshows, at least emerging market countries. South Africa did one recently, and Namibia. \"Either way the mandated bankers will come up with a broad sense of the terms for the bond, how to 'price' it. Then they pinpoint a day when they announce the deal. There's an initial price range, also called 'guidance', and investors will put orders into a 'book' run by the banks of how many bonds they want to buy and at what point in the price range. This process often takes all day, especially if a bond is being sold into several different markets (Europe, the US, Asia etc). Once investor interest (both in terms of price and size) has been tallied up, the mandated banks will converse with the borrower to decide at what level the bond will be priced and what amount will be issued. Once this has been done, investors' orders will be confirmed (ie that they want to buy the amount of bonds they've 'put in for' at the relevant price) and the debt issue will be officially priced before being free to be traded on the market. This is, of course, a very crude explanation of the process but it gives you an idea. \"We follow this process step by step, and publish the details as they become known. For instance, who's buying the bonds. We are not told who exactly these are but we receive a breakdown of investor types \u2013 pensions funds, insurance companies, central banks as well as a broad indication of the region they are from. We also have a team that does post-analysis of a deal. We talk to the market and ask what people there think of the final price for the bond. Then we talk to the lead-manager, the banker in charge of the issuance. \"What we try to avoid is post-analysis pieces that are just verbatim quotes from the press releases of the borrowers and the lead managers at the bank. Publications like ours should offer a balanced view, even though that is not scintillating and wildly interesting. It is what our clients are interested in. \"We need the people we write about, but they need us too, as we market their deals and put out analysis afterward. When the bond market press does a really glowing review, bankers are known to take that into their bonus review, or show it to borrowers when pitching. As I said, it's a community, and deals impact each other. If a bond issue for company X is priced too 'wide', meaning X offered too much and could have paid less, this affects the market for debt issuance by companies with characteristics similar to X. If you are a managing bank for that issuance, and you feel that the X deal was priced wrongly, you will be annoyed as it sets a benchmark \u2013 a precedent \u2013 for your deal and where that can then be priced. \"All sorts of players in the information market keep 'league tables' and these are keenly followed in the bond market. A league table keeps a tally of which bank and which bankers have most business, most mandates. Some leagues look at business and volume by sector, or by country, they may have different cut-off numbers \u2013 only including deals larger than, say, 500 million. If there are four banks in a consortium doing a particular deal, they get 25% of credit each. \"A typical day at work. I start at 7am, and get out by 5.30pm, which is a long day but not crazy. Around 9pm the American bond market in New York closes, so I'll check what happened there over with my US colleagues. All my girlfriends meet for lunch and go shopping. Lunch for me is a sandwich by my computer screen, unless we're taking clients out. Christmas and August time are brilliant because they are really boozy and a chance for a break from the office. \"I am now senior so I manage people. That is the hardest part of my job. You will have noticed that men are not always good at communicating, generally speaking. They grunt. Also, quite often I need to separate the stags, send one to the blue and the other to the red corner, so to speak. Then there's the thing that some men don't like being managed by a woman younger than they are. How I know? Very occasionally there are hints. Sometimes someone comes up to me and tells me that someone else said I could fuck off. It's a good thing I am told these things, I suppose. \"You can't get too sensitive about it, can't be in tears every day because somebody said something. I like to think that I'm fair to the men I manage \u2013 they're all men. I know their wives, know the names of their children. It might sound a bit hippy but I am convinced you get the best out of people not by being an asshole to them. Yes, I might grill people at interviews to see who they really are. But no grilling just to make them nervous. \"I realise this is a big generalisation and feminists will slap me round the head with their bras but \u2026 I prefer to work with men. In conflicts with men you only need to say 'sorry', and it's forgotten. Actually, half the time men don't even register you offended them. \"For years I was the only woman in the bond department of the firm. I probably swear more than men. And I'm very good at drinking. Generally speaking I'd say it was harder being young in the industry, than being a woman. My sense is that the reasons for female under-representation in finance are quite innocent. First, there are simply fewer women who want to do this \u2013 as there are fewer male midwives. \"Then it's just easier for a man to be rubbish and get away with it, because it's easier for men to develop relationships with men in senior positions. That's a matter of camaraderie, the golfing and strip-clubbing come into it. I don't mind the strip-clubbing. Went there a couple of times, just to see what it's like. But I would never propose to my colleagues to go to a male strip club. \"You have to have a thick skin, and be able to give some witty comment back. I agree that male chauvinism, while quite rare, is tolerated. But I have never been made to feel stupid or excluded because I am a woman. It used to be pretty bad in the industry but these days seem over. You get sued now. I'd argue that for journalists being a vaguely attractive woman can be an advantage. I mean, you need to get information out of people, right? \"What this bond pricer is saying about only men being interested in her work, that is totally true. My female friends are simply not interested in what I do. They're not stupid, they're uninterested. Friends ask me, what do you talk about at work? Well, we talk about the bond market! \"This Venture Capital fundraiser you spoke to about the difficulty of going in and out of the industry because it's constantly changing \u2026 same thing in the bond market. I know teachers; once you have your qualifications and a certain level of experience, you can take a few years out and have kids. In this industry you would almost need to be retrained after that. \"Nor can you do this job part time. You need to be in the market, monitor it every day, feel how things are going. I don't like to be away from the office, from the bond market. It's like my baby. \"I really enjoy my job and I don't take that for granted. I have friends who don't like their jobs, I'm fortunate and I don't want to give that up. At the same time I really want kids, and I don't want to be back in the office when my baby is two weeks' old. This is something hanging over every woman's head in finance in her early 30s: will they let me do that? I am hoping my employer will.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
