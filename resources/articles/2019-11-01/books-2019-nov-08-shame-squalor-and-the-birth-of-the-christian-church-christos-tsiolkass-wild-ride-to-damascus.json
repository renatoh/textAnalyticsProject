Was this man king of kings? Was he preaching mercy or revolution? Did he really survive his shabby death on a cross? Did he come to Earth to save mankind or punish sinners? Was the sect to be open to all, or only to Jews? Factions splinter, enmities deepen and their leaders grow desperate. Even those who had been on the road with Jesus cannot agree on the purpose of the faith. When would he be back to set them straight? All through the pages of Damascus comes the cry: \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Jesus the Saviour returned?\u201d Can this be the world of Christos Tsiolkas? He makes it so. He was always a master of squalor and cruelty. Jerusalem and Antioch reek in these pages. The lives of slaves are horrifying. So are the pagan cults of the time. In a lifetime\u2019s reading I\u2019ve never come across a precise account of what lions do to Christians in the arena. Hint: first the neck. But whatever Tsiolkas\u2019s world \u2013 a gay nightclub towards dawn, vengeful families after a backyard barbecue gone wrong, the East after Christ \u2013 he is on the same trajectory. Beyond the cruelty and squalor he evokes so vividly, beyond hate and ignorance, there is the prospect of kindness and goodness. The path of his writing is always towards those possibilities. They make sense of his work. What sets Damascus apart is the scale of those hopes. This is a novel that mourns what the world might have been, had bickering Christians back then agreed on a kinder version of Christ\u2019s message. At first this little sect feeds and clothes the poor, shelters the desperate, accepts slaves at their table. They have no mission to change the world. Their motto is to deal with life as passers-by. Then the zealots get to work. Tsiolkas talks of grappling with Paul first at high school in Melbourne and being repelled at the time by his attacks on homosexuals. But Tsiolkas could never shake off his fascination with this huge figure in history. Damascus is a lifetime\u2019s reckoning with this man and the faith he took into Europe. I had imagined that when it came \u2013 and Damascus was a long time coming \u2013 I would find myself reading an epic of sex in the ancient world. Not at all. To my surprise, I was completely absorbed by a novel exploring the lost possibilities of a faith I abandoned a long time ago. Can there be a harder era to put into fiction? How does a novelist in these secular days pitch such a story? Problems of attitude and tone arise at every turn. Hollywood has done such damage here. How does a writer avoid the cadence of the King James Bible without falling for the banalities of Ben-Hur? Tsiolkas\u2019s blunt prose is a large part of the answer. But what saves the enterprise is how absolutely seriously he takes the bizarre preoccupations of this time. But not as a believer. Tsiolkas writes about living men and women who are never more human than when they\u2019re being dragged this way and that by charismatic leaders like Paul. Damascus is the story of a stuttering zealot with a high-pitched voice, careful Greek and a bung eye who masters himself, his rivals and his last doubts to remake the world. Better than any of the better men around him, Paul understands the power that might be harnessed here. His cock is always stirring. But instead of sex Paul doubles down on faith. To the end he is tormented by \u201clusts and desires and shames that cannot be spoken\u201d. This man is unambiguously, miserably homosexual. His conversion on the road to the Syrian capital is rather pathetic. When he falls in with the Christians he had been persecuting he finds a childish, sexless joy. \u201cHe \u2026 feels closest to a happiness he hasn\u2019t felt since he was still a student. Before that first flush of beard; the deepening of voice and sprouting of hair and the more sinister unwanted and dangerous stirrings of youth.\u201d It might be imagined that Tsiolkas, an acclaimed gay writer of contemporary gay life, would make Paul\u2019s sexuality the focus of his novel, weigh into the man\u2019s hypocrisy and nail his grim version of the church to thwarted homosexuality. Certainly, the gay gene of Christianity is given its due. So many of its leaders failed to fulfill the absolute obligation of men to marry and father sons. On the list are Christ, his twin brother Thomas \u2013 Doubting Thomas \u2013 St Paul and his beloved pupil Timothy, plus the wretched head of the church in Colossae, Father Able. But shame is the real subject here, shame available to us all, shame and the steps by which shame overtook mercy as the power driving this sect. \u201cWhy has Jesus the Saviour not returned? Why is the promise unfulfilled,\u201d asks Able and points to the fornicators in the crowd. \u201cHe has not come because we are not deserving. He has not come because we are not righteous. He has not come because we are not worthy!\u201d It works. The worshippers rise to their feet in an ecstasy of remorse, calling on the Lord to pardon them. It\u2019s a scene as old as time and as modern as today. Two thousand years of history are in that moment. By this time Paul had disappeared to Rome, still powered by the pursuit of purity, his last doubts packed away, convinced it\u2019s all been worth the sacrifices, certain that faith alone will sustain his mission in the world. He leaves Thomas behind in Jerusalem. Thomas is Tsiolkas\u2019s man: a disciple full of doubts, not ashamed of his humanity, trusting only his eyes and ears. How could he not be a novelist\u2019s hero? \u201cMy twin is dead,\u201d Thomas says in a last confrontation with Paul. \u201cI buried him. I was the one who washed the hands and feet that had been pierced by nails. I was the one who wrapped him in his shroud and who placed him in his pariah\u2019s tomb. My brother is dead. But his words live.\u201d \u2022 Damascus by Christos Tsiolkas is out now through Allen &amp; Unwin"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
