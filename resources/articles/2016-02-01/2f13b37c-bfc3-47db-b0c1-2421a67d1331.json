It is on occasions such as this, a collision with one of the recently established elite, when Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s progress is properly gauged and when credence is given to their bid to become one of European football\u2019s powerhouses. At times this felt as if it could descend into a night of frustration. Instead, it ended as one of jubilation. This was not the thrashing the French had hoped to impose on a side 12th in the Premier League, a marker laid down as they progress further in the competition, but Laurent Blanc\u2019s team still have a lead with which to travel to London for next month\u2019s return. They will consider the reality that Chelsea must retrieve a deficit as cause for optimism, confident they will be able to wound on the counter where Lucas Moura and \u00c1ngel D\u00ed Mar\u00eda will be ever eager to spring upfield at pace. Perhaps the fact this was never the walkover some had envisaged may actually work in their favour. PSG were dominant but they were also exposed at times. Their advantage is only slender. Reminders they will not sleepwalk into another quarter-final may be timely. Yet there was also evidence that a team who sweep all before them virtually every week in Ligue 1 can raise their standards further when confronted by Europe\u2019s established elite. At home, PSG find life utterly uncompetitive to the tune of 35 unbeaten league matches and a fourth successive title sure to be secured before March is out. Their goal difference is already 51, the gap to second place extending to 24 points. The monopoly of domestic silverware is taken for granted in a championship chase warped by Qatari money but, aside from building a brand, the owners\u2019 target has always been a first European Cup. Victories like this reinforce the belief that heightened level of ambition is far from folly. The manner in which Blanc\u2019s team tore into Chelsea reflected an underlying expectation to progress that has never really carried this club before. Two years ago they were squeezed out by Chelsea on away goals, succumbing naively in the second leg in London. Retreat 12 months and they were already more streetwise, returning the compliment with a blend of resilience and brilliance at Stamford Bridge but progress still felt like a watershed. This time around they had hoped to stampede their opponents, PSG\u2019s intent demonstrated by Lucas\u2019 dispossession of Cesc F\u00e0bregas within 40 seconds. It is the class of their attacking ranks that marks them out. Lucas was a live wire, all swerving skill and searing pace from flank to centre, and the Brazilian would eventually eke out the free-kick from which Zlatan Ibrahimovic opened the scoring. The Swede is their talisman, a player of proper presence, even if that deflected reward was only his eighth goal in 37 Champions League knockout ties. He will travel to London with a point to prove given that last year\u2019s sending off in that arena, with his post-match complaints about \u201ccrying\u201d home players, still smarts. In midfield there is snarl and energy with Blaise Matuidi and Marco Verratti, the 23-year-old Italian now secured to terms until 2020, a busy combination buzzing around Thiago Motta\u2019s steadying influence. Then there is Di Mar\u00eda. The recruitment of the Argentinean, despite that rather incongruous season feeling unloved at Manchester United, was a key step in the Qatari strategy: a player whose willingness to come to Paris with his best years still potentially ahead of him changed a mindset. \u201cWith Di Mar\u00eda\u2019s arrival we moved from \u2018PSG can\u2019t win the Champions League\u2019 to \u2018With him PSG can win it\u2019,\u201d Blanc said. The 28-year-old, true to recent resurgent form, was more recognisable as the creator-in-chief voted man of the match as Real Madrid secured La Decima in 2014, his feet a blur as he eked out space and spread panic. There had been one exquisite pass slid for Lucas to collect beyond Gary Cahill and bear down on goal. When he drifted infield, the overworked Thibaut Courtois was forced to tip over swerving shots from distance. It would be Di Mar\u00eda\u2019s assist for Edinson Cavani that edged his side back in front. Di Mar\u00eda will be as potent a threat in the return as he seeks to remind English football of his capabilities. Yet, for all that Courtois\u2019 heroics kept Chelsea afloat, there were also reminders this competition can drive to distraction those who consider themselves contenders. If PSG were the more imposing team, Chelsea retained the capability to knock them from their perch. Kevin Trapp had already saved astoundingly from Diego Costa by the time Mikel John Obi forced Chelsea level. There were flashes of indecision across a backline not used to being tested and, where Oscar could not capitalise, those mouthwatering attacking talents at Real Madrid, Bayern Munich or Barcelona might have made hay. \u201cOur target had been not to concede, and we failed in that much,\u201d Blanc said. Therein lay the warning. Regardless, PSG will still travel with confidence. That is all they know these days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
