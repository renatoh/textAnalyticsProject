The Treasury signalled that ministers are hesitating when it admitted after the first meeting of the cabinet\u2019s public expenditure committee (PEX) that some departments had yet to produce final bids. Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary who attended the meeting, is digging in along with the home secretary Theresa May \u2013 who sent her junior minister Richard Harrington to the meeing. George Osborne chaired the meeting after he called on cabinet ministers in July to provide detailed costings for departmental savings at two levels \u2013 25% and 40% \u2013 in areas that are unprotected. The two key protected areas are health, where spending increases at least in line with inflation, and overseas aid, whose budget must account for 0.7% of gross national income (GNI). The departmental cuts are on top of the \u00a312bn of welfare cuts announced by the chancellor in the budget. A Treasury source struck an upbeat note after the meeting, saying that all government departments are now engaged though they have yet to present their final bids. The Treasury said that the chancellor and his deputy, chief secretary Greg Hands, are keen to avoid what areknown in Whitehall as \u201csalami slicing\u201d cuts, in which public services are arbitrarily cut back. Osborne and Hands instead want to focus on how services can be delivered more efficiently in what the Treasury is dubbing as a \u201cmore for less\u201d approach. The chancellor is focusing on two key areas: Redirecting Britain\u2019s aid budget, which is increasing by hundreds of millions of pounds a year in line with the UK\u2019s commitments to the UN as the UK economy grows, towards humanitarian emergencies. Osborne wants to increase the size of the reserve that is set aside for emergencies. The chancellor has already announced that the uplift in spending on overseas aid, the extra money triggered under the UK\u2019s commitment to spend 0.7% of its GNI on international development, should be spent on emergencies such as the refugee crisis in Syria. Speeding up the devolution of powers, as part of Osborne\u2019s northern powerhouse plan, following the chancellor\u2019s announcement in his conference speech that he would devolve business rates. A series of devolution deals will be negotiated with regions. A Treasury source said: \u201cThe government has already directed the aid budget towards supporting those caught up in the Syrian refugee crisis, and plans to use it to support the 20,000 of them we have agreed should settle in Britain over the next five years. \u201cThe government is discussing holding more money in reserve so we can respond even better to humanitarian crises, and how we can target money at the global challenges that threaten Britain. \u201cFollowing the plans set out at the Conservative conference for a devolution revolution involving councils retaining all \u00a326bn in business rate revenue, including new freedoms to alter rates, ministers also discussed devolving powers, responsibilities and funding to local areas. We are determined to refashion the relationship between local and central government and give cities and regions the right to stand on their own and make their own decisions.\u201d Osborne and Hands were joined at the meeting by eight spending cabinet ministers \u2013 Iain Duncan Smith, Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, John Whittingdale, Greg Clark, Justine Greening, Patrick McLoughlin and Philip Hammond. The Treasury source added: \u201cThe spending review next month isn\u2019t just about saving money so that Britain lives within its means and starts running the strongest budget in half a century, but how we can get more for the taxpayers\u2019 money we do spend. \u201cSo the chancellor has today chaired the first cabinet-level committee to discuss how Whitehall departments will deliver on the government\u2019s commitment to fix the public finances while delivering a smarter state.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
