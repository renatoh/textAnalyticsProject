Developed by independent credit card company Accucard, it enables people to tailor the annual fee, interest rate and cash-back option to suit their own lifestyle. To apply for the card, customers need to fill in an online application form. They will then be given a range of interest rates, annual charges and cash-back options to choose from to suit their own needs. A high spending consumer who settles their bill in full each month may not be concerned what interest rate they are charged, but may want a higher percentage of cash-back on the purchases they make. Alternatively, someone who does not pay off their bill each month may choose a higher annual charge but receive a much lower interest rate. Cardholders can change the terms of their personalised card as often as they want, so if they decide they cannot clear their card at the end of the month they can opt for a lower interest rate, but a higher annual fee. Ed Harycki, chief executive of Accucard, said: \"Accucard intends to make the card widely available, both through our own marketing and through a number of high street names that are keen to enter the card market. \"Through our dynamic personalisation concept and card builder technology, everyone will have a card that is right for them.\" The card is due to be available from September this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
