Some Democrats were conciliatory. Connecticut representative John Larson, who was scheduled to meet with House speaker Paul Ryan later in the day to talk about the gun control standoff, hailed Ryan as a \u201chonest and forthright man\u201d who is \u201cnot just speaker for the Republican conference\u201d but \u201cspeaker of the entire house\u201d. He said the Democrats \u201cprevail on the good nature of the speaker\u201d and the \u201cdecency\u201d of Republicans to allow a vote on two Democrat-supported gun control bills. Larson said that the House has not made any substantive votes on gun control legislation for more than three and a half years, since after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in 2012. Others Democrats were less forgiving. Rhode Island congressman David Cicilline slammed the \u201ctyranny of the majority\u201d and Republicans\u2019 \u201cdeliberate inaction in the face of 33,000 deaths caused by gun violence each year\u201d. \u201cWe just celebrated Independence Day,\u201d Texas Democrat Lloyd Doggett said. \u201cHow about the Republicans declaring independence from the gun lobby, just once, in a very small, modest way?\u201d Since their rebellious 26-hour sit-in before the Independence Day recess, House Democrats have pledged to keep fighting for votes on gun control legislation. On Tuesday, the first day the House was back in session, Democrats did not initially stage freewheeling acts of civil disobedience. Instead, they filled the day with a long series of statements on gun violence. Their speeches were short, many just a minute long. But they hammered the same themes over and over: polls showed the majority of Americans supported gun control measures. Their constituents wanted to see action on gun violence, and had welcomed the Democrats\u2019 sit-in for gun control with gratitude and enthusiasm. Republicans should not be afraid to put their votes on gun control measures on the record. Some of the Democrats, including Chicago representative Robin Kelly, read aloud the names of constituents lost to shootings, in an attempt to broaden the conversation from the toll of mass shootings, like the one last month at an Orlando LGBT nightclub, to gun violence that claims lives every day. Kelly read the names of 79 people lost to gun violence in Chicago in the past month, a total larger than even the 50 killed in Orlando, the largest mass shooting in US history. Maryland representative Donna Edwards noted that one analysis of mass shootings found that the majority were sparked by domestic or family violence. She argued that gun violence took a unique toll on American women and that domestic violence and background check laws should be tightened. Democrats mentioned a number of different potential gun control measures, including a new federal ban on assault weapons. Kellyinvoked Martin Luther King Jr and said: \u201cCertainly, there is no place for assault rifles in the beloved community.\u201d House Democrats are currently pushing just two bills: one that would bar suspected terrorists from buying guns, and one that would expand background checks to private sales at gun shows and over the internet, according to leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office. Ryan has agreed to a vote on only one gun-related measure, as part of a broader anti-terrorism package. That proposal, similar to a Senate measure backed by the National Rifle Association, would let the attorney general delay a gun purchase by a suspected terrorist for three days, and let law enforcement officials ask a judge to block the purchase altogether. The law would also give the suspected terrorist a chance to respond in court. Republican Kevin McCarthy, who introduced the legislation, said in a statement that the measure balanced the need to keep weapons out of the hands of the terrorists with protections for Americans\u2019 rights. Both liberals and conservatives have raised concerns about simply denying the right to purchase a gun to anyone listed on a secret government watch list . Democrats criticized this Republican measure as a \u201ccynical\u201d NRA-approved bill that will not give law enforcement enough authority to block terrorists. The measure\u2019s standard of proof was unreasonable, they argued, saying that if law enforcement had probable cause they would already have moved to arrest. The same measure has already failed in the Senate. Countering Ryan\u2019s arguments that the Democratic sit-in was a \u201cpublicity stunt\u201d, Democrats accused Republicans of political theater by scheduling a vote on a measure that had already been rejected by the Senate. Doggett suggested Republicans should schedule a vote instead on bipartisan legislation crafted by Republican senator Susan Collins. \u201cEveryone who owns a gun knows that sometimes you need to keep the safety on that gun. I think it\u2019s time to put the safety back in gun safety legislation,\u201d Doggett said. Earlier on Tuesday, McCarthy told reporters that the House was investigating reports that Democrats participating in the sit-in had been inappropriately rough to GOP House staffers, including knocking things out of their hands. \u201cAs the speaker has said, we are in the process of reviewing what transpired during the demonstration,\u201d Molly Edwards, the speaker\u2019s deputy press secretary, said in an email. Pelosi\u2019s spokeswoman responded to comments with more criticism of the NRA. \u201cThe lengths the House Republican leadership will go to follow the NRA\u2019s marching orders know no bounds,\u201d spokesman Drew Hammill said in a statement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
