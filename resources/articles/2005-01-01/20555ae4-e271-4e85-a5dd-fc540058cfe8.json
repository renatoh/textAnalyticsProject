The match flared into a mass brawl following a 79th-minute challenge by Duncan Ferguson on the Boro goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. The referee Dermot Gallagher, who issued no cards but warned the captains Gareth Southgate and Alan Stubbs to keep their players under control, made no mention of the incident in his report, filed to Soho Square on Monday. He said he had not seen any punches thrown and considered the action of most of the players to be \"protective\". Both clubs now face heavy fines for failing to control their players and have until February 2 to respond to the charge. \"We are considering our options,\" said an Everton spokesman. Middlesbrough were \"disappointed and surprised\", particularly as the referee is understood to have told them that no action would be taken. \"The circumstances were unusual,\" said an FA source. \"Once the [TV] pictures were seen the compliance unit decided to investigate.\" Middlesbrough have been dealt another blow with confirmation that the defender Ugo Ehiogu sustained knee ligament damage in an unrelated incident in the same game. The defender was making a comeback after playing only two previous games this season, after recovering from a persistent calf problem. He began limping early in the game after an accidental clash with Schwarzer and was replaced by Colin Cooper in the 17th minute. The injury leaves Boro short of players in the centre of defence. Chris Riggott is already ruled out of Saturday's trip to Norwich with a hamstring problem, leaving Southgate and Cooper as the only fit centre-halves with experience. Michael Reiziger has injured a little toe, moreover, although it has not been confirmed whether or not it is fractured."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
