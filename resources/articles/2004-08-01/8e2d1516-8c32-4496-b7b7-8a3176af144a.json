When Gray's blustering soul, belligerent wit and defiantly old-school socialism are at their sharpest or most poignant, he sounds an unfashionably truthful knell. Take the peculiar love between an ageing brother and sister in \"Miss Kinkaid's Autumn\" (containing my favourite sentence: \"I've seen much worse weather but for sheer dull depressing misery a damp Scottish November cannot be surpassed\"); or Job, emerging from the chrysalis of his own flayed skin after his fortune's been sunk in a dotcom pension scheme, whose sons' misfortune was to work in the Twin Towers. But too often he relies on his trademark charm and eccentricity to see us through whimsy. SA Dead Girls, by Nancy Lee (Faber, \u00a37.99) These cool, pathologically disturbing stories are thematically linked by the trial of a dentist charged with the serial murders of prostitutes and addicts. His presence stalks Lee's parade of the victim-prone. As a surgical writer, deft at conjuring human tics in the slenderest language, her irony comes chillingly detached: in \"Associated Press\", where shocking images from around the world recorded by a photographer are offset by the token sado-masochism indulged in by his ex-girlfriend; in a teenager \"selling\" his girl on Valentine's night; in an addicted nurse on hand at a school dance-a-thon to raise funds for a drugs awareness programme. There are moments of surprising tenderness, as in \"Sally, In Parts\", where Lee dissects her character's body from her vagina to her hands in search of a lost father-daughter relationship. But there's an uneasy prurience throughout, as the narrator remains superior and elusive, morphing victimhood on to her subjects. SA Somersault, by Kenzaburo Oe (Atlantic, \u00a39.99) In his '94 Nobel lecture, Oe praised the American translator of Kawabata, Japan's other Nobel laureate, as \"an expert traduttore... or in the least a traditore (betrayer)\". I've a hunch Philip Gabriel's dry rendering of Oe's latest (and, you have been warned, enormous) philosophical tome hasn't helped matters. Fascinated by Japan's \"ambiguity\", Oe describes himself as scarred by the conflict between Tokyo's western consumer culture and his country's traditional outlook. It's a scar that runs here like a \"gouged-out pomegranate-shaped wound\" on the side of Patron, trance-prone leader of a cult that disbanded 10 years ago, when the pair renounced their movement in a televised \"somersault\" to prevent their radical faction turning nuclear plants into bombs. Now, the apocalypse still on track, Patron wishes to reveal all through his \"Church of the New Man\". Referencing Aum Shinrikyo, Oe offers a sympathetic exploration of the roots of religious extremism. SA The Voices, by Susan Elderkin (Harper Perennial, \u00a37.99) Susan Elderkin's imagination is one of the few things that seems to flourish in the desert. Her debut, Sunset Over Chocolate Mountains, was set in the wastes of Arizona; the follow-up takes us to the parched red earth of the Australian outback. Billy Saint is an awkward child who spends his time communing with kangaroos and playing with a mysterious Aboriginal spirit child. Thirty years later he turns up in a psychiatric hospital covered in strange ritual lacerations. In the interim, Elderkin spins out endless tracts of descriptive prose: \"All day the heat built and built as if pumped by a vast, ancient heart, recycling an age-old sadness with its dull, leaden templed beat.\" There are flashes of brilliance, but Billy is a curiously opaque hero and the narrative never really sloughs off the weight of its research. And the manner in which Elderkin makes the reader complicit is annoying: \"Having nothing better to do we amble along behind.\" AH China, by Alan Wall (Vintage, \u00a37.99) Theo plays trumpet like Miles Davis; Reg plays drums like Buddy Rich; Paul thrums his bass in imitation of Mingus, and Breezer blows his horn like Coltrane. Zeno, in other words, are a jazz band with an originality problem. Alan Wall's novel is a smoky evocation of a jobbing combo in the doldrums, but like most jazz aficionados he has difficulty putting the invention of the music into words. Still, the one thing more cumbersome than Wall's jazz criticism is his rock criticism: \"Alex wielded his axe as though it were a prosthetic extension to his penis, swivelling out from his hips and seeding the air around him with the speedy blur of rock's ectoplasm\"; and the one thing less digestible than his rock criticism is his opinion of opera: \"opera singers still sang as if they were simultaneously addressing Queen Victoria, trying to remember the words of their mantra and holding a peacock's feather in position up their anus without benefit of manual assistance.\" AH The Monkey Wrench Gang, by Edward Abbey (Penguin, \u00a37.99) With the invention of Vietnam vet-turned-industrial saboteur and dam breaker George Hayduke, Edward Abbey virtually wrote the handbook for environmental activism. Some protest groups even took to daubing the slogan \"Hayduke Lives!\" to advertise their presence. Hayduke not only lives, he has been elevated to the status of a Penguin Modern Classic, though this virile celebration of dynamic manhood, \"Potent as a pistol, dangerous as dynamite, tough and mean and hard and full of love for his fellow man\", draws heavily on the archetypes of the potboiler westerns Abbey also produced. Far more engaging are his unlikely trio of fellow ecowarriors: Sarvis, a mild-mannered, billboard-burning physician; Abbzug, a feisty feminist revolutionary; and Seldom Seen Smith, a polygamist Mormon preacher and riverboat guide, who provides high comedy when he wakes from a nightmare and takes three attempts to get his wife's name right.
