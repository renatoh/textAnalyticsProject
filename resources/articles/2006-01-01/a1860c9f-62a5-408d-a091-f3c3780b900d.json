The Northern Ireland (offences) bill had initially been opposed by all parties in Northern Ireland bar Sinn F\u00e9in, as well as the Tories and Liberal Democrats - and would have seen suspected paramilitaries not covered by the Good Friday agreement being allowed to own up to their crimes in return for being charged but released on licence. Announcing the surprise move in the Commons, the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Hain, held out the prospect of returning full devolved government to Ulster by the end of 2006, and announced full summit talks of all the Northern Ireland parties for next month aimed at restoring Stormont. Mr Hain told MPs that Sinn F\u00e9in's decision late last month to reverse its original position and oppose the bill because security forces personnel would also have qualified for the scheme had rendered the legislation meaningless. \"Sinn F\u00e9in has now said that any republican potentially covered by the legislation should have nothing to do with it,\" the minister said. \"But if nobody goes through the process, victims, who would have suffered the pain of having to come to terms with this legislation, would have had done so for nothing. \"That is unacceptable and I am therefore withdrawing the bill.\" The bill - which caused outrage among unionists - would have enabled people who had been living abroad, or people suspected of murders before the Good Friday agreement, to avoid ever having to go to jail in Northern Ireland for offences. To qualify, they would have been asked to apply to a certification commissioner to ensure they would not be sent to prison. The commissioner would have asked the police if the person was suspected of crimes. If the applicant was, he or she would have been issued with a certificate guaranteeing they would not be arrested. The certificate would have set in train a special tribunal, with its own judge and prosecutors, to examine the offence the person is alleged to have committed. If the person was found guilty, he or she would have received a special licence similar to that given to 400 paramilitary prisoners released under the Good Friday agreement guaranteeing they remain free unless they offend again. Victims and human rights groups, the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, unionists, nationalist SDLP and the cross-community Alliance party condemned the legislation for failing to compel those accused of offences to face their victims during the tribunal hearings. The SDLP and Sinn F\u00e9in also criticised the inclusion of security force personnel involved in murders carried out by loyalist paramilitary groups in the scheme. Sweetening the pill of the surprise announcement, Mr Hain acknowledged continuing anger in Northern Ireland at the multimillion pound cost of maintaining the Northern Ireland assembly - mothballed since an allegation of an IRA spy ring in 2002 - at a cost of \u00a378m. Mr Hain said it was essential to get the assembly up and running again before the next set of elections, in March 2007. He told MPs 2006 was a \"make or break\" year for the province's politicians and added: \"We cannot let things drift. \"I am therefore asking each of the political parties to agree dates for substantial discussions in early February with the British and Irish governments to give their views on the way forward to restore the political institutions. \"The prime minister, together with the taoiseach, will be closely involved with developments during the year.\" He added: \"\"If there is no restoration of the assembly in prospect, then two stark realities have to be faced. \"First, public resentment within Northern Ireland continues to build at the continued payment of assembly members of salaries and allowances totalling on average \u00a385,000 per member while Stormont stands idle. Since it was suspended in October 2002, the assembly has cost \u00a378m to maintain. \"Countless times voters in Northern Ireland have asked me: how long this can go on? I want to tell the house today: not many months more. \"Second, no Northern Ireland political leader has disagreed with me that it would be traducing democracy to have elections - for a second time - to an assembly that does not exist. \"Elections are due in May 2007. For those to be meaningful we must have an assembly exercising its full responsibilities. We therefore need to make progress urgently. We cannot let things drift.\" He added; \"But 2006 can and must be a year of historic progress in Northern Ireland. It must be a year in which we will see a devolved, power-sharing executive of local politicians taking the decisions that affect the everyday lives of the people of Northern Ireland. \" The scrapping of bill was warmly welcomed by a leading victims' group. William Frazer, of Families Acting for Innocent Relatives [FAIR], said: \"I am glad he has done this - it's about the only sensible thing he has done since he came to Northern Ireland.\" \"This legislation should never have been introduced in the first place.\" Tonight the prime minister's official spokesman said there was \"no point\" in going through with legislation that would not be used. But he added that the issue would have to be \"dealt with because the issue is there, and the anomaly will therefore have to be dealt with in some way\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
