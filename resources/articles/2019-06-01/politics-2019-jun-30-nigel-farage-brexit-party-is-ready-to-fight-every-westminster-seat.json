Speaking at a noisy rally in Birmingham, which saw the first 100 candidates paraded before the crowd but not named, Farage said it was impossible to trust either Johnson or Jeremy Hunt over their Brexit plans. Farage was also scathing about Johnson\u2019s boast during a Conservative leadership hustings that he was best placed to \u201cput Nigel Farage back in his box\u201d. \u201cBy the end of next week we will have 650 approved prospective parliamentary candidates,\u201d Farage told the crowd of more than 5,000 activists. \u201cThere is a big message that Westminster needs to hear. We are not a protest movement. Oh, and by the way, Mr Johnson, you can try if you want to, but I will not be put back in my box by you or anybody else.\u201d Farage said his party had now replaced the Conservatives in some areas. \u201cThere are many seats in the country, especially many Labour-held seats in the country, where we are now the challenger \u2013 where only we can beat the Labour party,\u201d he said. He said an institutional bias against Brexit meant the Conservatives could not be trusted. \u201cI believe, without us there will be no proper Brexit, because we have a remain parliament, because we have remain broadcast media.\u201d He added, to boos from the crowd: \u201cAndrew Marr anybody?\u201d Farage\u2019s new party won the biggest share of the vote in May\u2019s European elections, gaining 29 MEPs, and has been polling at more than 20% in surveys of Westminster voting intentions. However, the Brexit party lost to Labour in the recent Peterborough byelection, and is seeking to have the result challenged in court over what Farage told the rally were \u201chighly dubious electoral practices\u201d, which he did not fully explain. In a long speech that included elements reminiscent of other populist politicians such as Donald Trump, Farage led boos against Labour frontbenchers such as Diane Abbott, and called Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement \u201cthe worst deal in history\u201d. He also complained about Labour MPs pursuing a \u201cglobalist agenda\u201d, a term associated with conspiracy theories, some with antisemitic overtones. Farage has previously been criticised by Jewish groups for using such language. Saying his new party now had 115,000 paying supporters, Farage urged those at the rally to help with campaigning. \u201cI have to tell you, aside from the 650 candidates, there are many things that I want you to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI am asking for your help because beyond the general election, maybe even before the general election, we will have to find thousands of people to stand up and fight local elections for us, right across the country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
