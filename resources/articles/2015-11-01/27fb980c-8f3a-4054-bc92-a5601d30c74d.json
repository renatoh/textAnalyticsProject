If Arsenal do not conjure the required victory against Olympiakos in Athens on 9 December \u2013 most likely by two goals \u2013 they will be able to reflect that this Dinamo Zagreb team have in effect knocked them out of the Champions League. And they will kick themselves all the way to the Europa League knockout stages. The Croatian champions were little more than chicken feed here, offering next to nothing, and to say that Arsenal won at a canter is the understatement of the campaign. For long spells, it felt like a training ground match and the result was never in doubt, even before Mesut \u00d6zil\u2019s goal. It only made the 2-1 loss that Arsenal suffered at the Maksimir Stadium back in September all the more galling and inexplicable. 2) Bayern Munich keep their end of the bargain There are few certainties in life, apart from death, taxes and Bayern Munich home wins over Olympiakos, which was a good thing for Arsenal, as it was what they needed to give them the chance to remain in the Champions League. \u201cI\u2019m confident Bayern will give everything to try and win that game and the group,\u201d Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had written in the programme beforehand and, happily and predictably, he had nothing to worry about. Bayern were 3-0 up after 20 minutes, with Douglas Costa opening the scoring, and there would be no need for radios pressed to ears at the Emirates or, more accurately, fingers tapping smart phones. Bayern had racked up 28 goals in their previous six home games \u2013 all thumping wins. Olympiakos were the latest victims. 3) Concerns over Giroud leave S\u00e1nchez holding the fort Wenger responded with a typical piece of Wengerese when he was asked the inevitable question about why he did not give Alexis S\u00e1nchez a breather in the second-half, when the game was utterly safe. \u201cBecause a break makes him tired,\u201d Wenger replied. It was a light-hearted way of saying that the forward wants to play and has to play. He was remorseless here, making the difference with two goals and one assist but Wenger did make the point that when he moved him up front in the 68th minute, after the substitution of Olivier Giroud, S\u00e1nchez was relieved of tracking back responsibilities. Wenger said that his hands were tied as Giroud, his only fit striker, had to come off because of a slight ankle niggle from the weekend. 4) The Emirates sleepwalks to Athens decider The evening had started with the lights going out at the stadium, before the teams came out, in what was a snazzy attempt to crank up a bit of expectation and atmosphere. When they came back on, it was apparent that there were thousands of empty seats, and it was also clear that lethargy hung in the air. The official record showed that 58,978 tickets had been sold \u2013 which was short of capacity \u2013 but loads of season-ticket holders had not bothered to turn up, too. You could see little bits of the lettering on the seats across part of the lower tier and, despite it being a must-win Champions League game, it was just one of those nights when it all felt flat. Thoughts are now on Athens in December. It felt as though they were from the first whistle. 5) Flamini gets the juices flowing to offer midfield solution Mathieu Flamini took time out from his mission to save the world to answer a more mundane \u2013 and rather familiar \u2013 issue at his primary place of employment. The environmentally conscious Frenchman has poured millions into an energy company that has trialled and is mass producing levulinic acid, which is said to be able to replace oil in all its forms. Here, he was called upon to replace the injured Francis Coquelin and Mikel Arteta in defensive midfield. Coquelin is out for at least three months \u2013 and there is relief at the club that it is not for even longer \u2013 while Arteta will be a month or so. Flamini was Flamini, crunching, barging and snapping, which was a feat in itself in such a procession. He also had a hand in \u00d6zil\u2019s opening goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
