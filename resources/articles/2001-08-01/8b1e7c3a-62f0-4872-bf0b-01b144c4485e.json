According to retail analysts, there won't be many arms in the air, and those that are will belong to the Rolex-wearing classes immune to all but the most severe downturns. Consumers may still be spending - there are no signs of a slowdown in tomorrow's British Retail Consortium sales figures for July - but what on? Tony Shiret, retail analyst at CSFB, said: 'Food is strong because of inflation, clothing is another area of strength, partly because sales have been weak for some years. DIY was running poorly until Easter but then the weather improved.' But, he said: 'The underlying consumer feeling is nervous and the Bank [of England] will have asked how sustainable retail spending is.' The British Retail Consortium's economist, Pamela Webber, said: 'Consumer spending, particularly on the high street, is holding up because, although you are hearing a lot about recession it doesn't effect people until they start seeing large-scale redundancies on the news.' But consumer confidence can change very quickly, she said. Talk of global meltdown at the end of 1998 'was like a tap being turned off'. Barclays Bank's chief executive Matt Barrett, unveiling a 16 per cent pre-tax profit rise on Thursday, said there was 'an excess of doom and gloom about the economy from some commentators'. Halifax economist Martin Ellis said on Friday that sustained consumer optimism is due to 'the continuing fall in unemployment and the record level of unfilled job vacancies'. But Barrett revealed that Barclay's had increased its provision for bad and doubtful debts from \u00a3397m to \u00a3498m and spoke of the need for 'caution' if not 'alarm'. Ellis warned that the UK economy was not an island in a sea of deteriorating world economic conditions. He said: 'Slower economic growth - apparent in the decline in gross domestic product growth in the second quarter - is likely to cause house price inflation to ease over the coming months.' Signs are that although retail spending - a third of all consumer spending - is strong, people are buying out of necessity rather than frivolity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
