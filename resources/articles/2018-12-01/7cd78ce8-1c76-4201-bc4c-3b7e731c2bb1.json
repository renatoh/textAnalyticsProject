The police released footage last month showing officers \u201ctipping\u201d thieves on to the ground by driving their patrol cars into the mopeds. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, tweeted: \u201cKnocking people off bikes is potentially very dangerous. It shouldn\u2019t be legal for anyone. Police are not above the law.\u201d The Police Federation also said that although it broadly supported the Met\u2019s tough tactics, the measures \u201cbreach current legislation\u201d. The prime minister, speaking to reporters at the G20 summit in Argentina, said the problem of moped gangs was growing and the police had her backing. \u201cThese people on these mopeds, they are acting unlawfully. They are committing crimes,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s right that we see a robust police response.\u201d Among those who tweeted back after Abbott\u2019s criticism was a verified account for Camden police in north London. \u201cSomeone who\u2019s responsible for law-making (or at least debating and ratifying new legislation) should probably realise that using tactical contact to terminate dangerous pursuits is entirely within our lawful power. And our responsibility.\u201d Cressida Dick, the Met police commissioner, said in an interview on Channel 5: \u201cThey\u2019ve been risk-assessing it. These are people who have been repeatedly left in no doubt whatsoever that there\u2019s a police car right behind them. If you look over your shoulder and drive on as fast as possible, putting the public in danger, you should expect we will come after you, and we have had a very small number of injuries.\u201d The Met said there had been a 36% reduction in thefts that involved mopeds or scooters since the tactics were adopted last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
