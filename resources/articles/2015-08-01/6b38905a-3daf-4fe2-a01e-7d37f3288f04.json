Why, though, would a film reviving debates between upper-class intellectuals half a century ago make for a hit film in 2015? \u201cIt took a long time to make, because no one wanted to fund it,\u201d explains vindicated co-director Robert Gordon. \u201cPeople thought: \u2018Who\u2019ll want to watch a movie about a couple of public intellectuals arguing on TV?\u2019 Well, we made the movie, and they were wrong.\u201d The success is partly due to the unimaginability, nowadays, of such cerebral prizefighting before a mass audience. The setting is America in the mire of Vietnam: Buckley and the right digging in to fight a patriotic just war on communism and what they saw as decay at home; Vidal and the radical counterculture in ferment against both the war and the society waging it. Vidal and Buckley argue with visceral sincerity across that fault line, in a way that the routine polemic of today lacks or plasters over. \u201cNowadays,\u201d says Gordon, \u201cyou could watch the shouting matches with the TV switched to mute. You know what they\u2019re going to say; it\u2019s all noise between the commercial breaks.\u201d The debates were staged as a high-risk strategy, as ABC fell behind rivals. Buckley founded and edited National Review, credited with having inspired Ronald Reagan; Vidal was a homosexual historian and novelist from a Democrat family. Their intellectual dispute was one of informed, passionate loathing. As the late Christopher Hitchens, a close friend of Vidal\u2019s, says in the film: \u201cthere is nothing feigned about their mutual antagonism. They really did despise each other, it comes from a deep well.\u201d Their rivalry fell within a deep well of historical tradition: Plato versus Aristotle pitting idealism against methodology; Jung versus Freud over the unconscious; Vavilov versus Lysenko over genetics and the environment. Or Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre, existentialist friends who fell out over French Algeria and the politics of the individual against those of the masses. All of which, notes Gordon, stands in marked contrast to the chumminess between Bill Clinton and George W Bush, after decades of professed disagreement, \u201cunless of course that is just appearance too. When the cameras went off Buckley and Vidal, these guys didn\u2019t go for a drink\u201d. Memphis-based Gordon speaks as both a producer-director of this film and author of a wonderful biography of blues master Muddy Waters, Can\u2019t Be Satisfied, and thus addresses his theme as lying \u2013 like Muddy\u2019s blues \u2013 at the kernel of American culture. And this at a time when there were \u201cbad lines being drawn\u201d \u2013 as the musician Stephen Stills put it \u2013 which cogently inform the present and across which there could be no compromise. At one level the argument is universal, as Richard Wald, then vice-president of ABC News puts it: \u201cWhat kind of people we should be, who is the better person?\u201d On another, the soul of America is at issue: \u201cThe stakes were the republic itself,\u201d says Gordon. \u201cThey both believed that were the other\u2019s view to prevail, it would take down the republic. This was not just dislike or even hatred, it was also fear \u2013 fear for America.\u201d Among Vidal\u2019s themes in the film, and his books, is that of America as empire, and his warnings \u2013 \u201cas Pericles pointed out\u201d \u2013 of empire\u2019s overstretch and decadence; \u201cprescient by 45 years\u201d, says Gordon. Buckley meanwhile likened the hoisting of a Vietcong flag by protesters outside the Democrat convention of 1968 in Chicago as akin to flying a swastika. As part of ABC\u2019s coverage of the police \u201cblue riot\u201d that ensued in Chicago \u2013 batons cracking student skulls \u2013 Vidal calls Buckley a \u201ccrypto-Nazi\u201d for justifying the brutality, to which Buckley snaps: \u201cListen to me you queer, stop calling me a crypto-Nazi or I\u2019ll sock you in the goddamn face and you\u2019ll stay plastered.\u201d The jagged clarity of the antagonism that leads to this moment when the banks burst, and the intellectual rip-tide beneath it, contrasts, says Gordon, with both present-day obfuscation \u2013 whereby politicians, columnists and TV presenters slither around, or just ignore, the themes of imperialism and American power \u2013 and also the banal, \u201critual shouting matches\u201d to which viewers of CNN, Fox, BBC and others are now subjected. \u201cIt has to do with the corruption of debate,\u201d says Gordon. \u201cThe conflagration between Buckley and Vidal was like a forest fire in the redwoods: huge old wood burning with depth. What you see now in supposedly antagonistic discourse is flash paper, it leaves no ash. Now people can be bought; now, the discussion ain\u2019t really for the sake of the nation, it\u2019s about personal gain.\u201d In one chilling line, writer and commentator Eric Alterman says the discourse between Vidal and Buckey is \u201charbinger of an unhappy future\u201d for America \u2013 which of course it is. But Gordon rejects any notion that his project is nostalgic, insisting that his film\u2019s appeal shows \u201ca hunger out there for quality debate of ideas, and the word I\u2019ve most heard used to describe the film is \u2018delicious\u2019. \u201cIn a way, Hitchens was the last of his kind,\u201d he says, \u201cbut there\u2019s Andrew Sullivan, with whom I don\u2019t always agree but find compelling; David Rieff \u2013 what would happen if he aired his views against his adversaries? And Sam Tanenhaus, Buckley\u2019s biographer; when he and Hitchens said they were interested in our project, we knew we not only had a film, but a great film. We interviewed Hitch two weeks before his diagnosis [with terminal leukemia].\u201d Gordon continues: \u201cIt\u2019s a wishful fantasy I have for the effect of the film. Nowadays, the issues at stake are the future of the planet, and it would be a brave move by a TV network to do what ABC did back then, perhaps in desperation. Get the thinkers out into the open like Vidal and Buckley, a really radical idea, against the grain.\u201d MIND GAMES: GREAT INTELLECTUAL CLASHES Plato v Aristotle A clash between two ways of how to approach understanding of the world: mystical idealist and methodological, which would become scientific method. Leibniz v Newton Bitter dispute over who \u2013 and whose country \u2013 could claim the invention of calculus; Gottfried Wilhem von Leibniz had written first, in 1684, before Isaac Newton\u2019s Opticks, of 1704. Freud v Jung A row between erstwhile mentor Sigmund Freud and pupil Carl Jung, during a series of lectures in 1912, regarding the human unconscious, the origins of neuroses, dreams and sexuality. Vavilov v Lysenko An argument that took on vicious political connotations in Stalin\u2019s USSR over the nature of genetic and environmental matters, focusing on Nikolai Vavilov\u2019s work with plants. Stalin backed the anti-genetic Trofim Lysenko, and Vavilov died of starvation in jail. Camus v Sartre A rift at the heart of French existentialism and leftwing politics, between friends who split bitterly over France\u2019s role in Algeria and the independence movement, and the nature of the individual and mass politics \u2013 between Albert Camus\u2019s humanism and Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s Marxism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
