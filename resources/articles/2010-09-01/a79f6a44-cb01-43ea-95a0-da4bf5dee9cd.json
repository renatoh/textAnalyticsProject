Having lost at each stage in the lower courts, the Foreign Office had appealed to the Lords on grounds of defence, feasibility and cost of resettlement. While all five law lords agreed that the royal prerogative was subject to judicial review, three decided that the order in council of June 2004 banning the Chagossians from returning to their homeland was lawful. Lord Bingham's opinion was a model of brevity, succinctness and clarity. The prerogative had never been exercised to exile an indigenous people from its homeland. This could not be done without debate in parliament and democratic decision. Lord Bingham dismissed the defence argument, characterising the letters written by US officials as \"highly imaginative\". In 30 years the US had not exercised its treaty right to extend its base to the outer islands, 140 miles from its base on Diego Garcia. In 1968 US officials had expressly said that they had no objection to resettlement and in 2000 resettlement was not perceived to threaten security. It could not be doubted that this right was of intangible value and the smaller its practical value, the less reason to take it away. It is to be hoped that when it hears the case later this year, the European court of human rights will uphold the principles of human rights and parliamentary democracy enunciated by Lord Bingham. He will long be remembered as a champion of the Chagossian cause. David Snoxell British high commissioner to Mauritius, 2000-04"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
