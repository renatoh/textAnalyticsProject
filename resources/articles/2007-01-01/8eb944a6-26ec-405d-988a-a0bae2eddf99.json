It is permanently cutting prices on 600 key items by a total of \u00a380m. The move will be viewed by critics as another example of how the increasingly dominant retailer is flexing its muscles against smaller competitors. A report published yesterday appeared to underline its strength, suggesting that the grocer took up half of all the new shopping space in Britain last year. The data, collected by Verdict Research, said Tesco opened 2m sq ft, more than the entire Bluewater shopping centre in Kent. It currently has around 21.6% of the grocery market in Britain, according to research firm Planet Retail, followed by Sainsbury with 11.8% and Asda at 10.1%. Tesco is cutting up to 30% off the price of a range of everyday items including ketchup, tea bags and fruit juices, as well as more than 100 health and beauty products. In addition to the more long-term cuts, it will be pushing more than 100 half-price promotions within its stores. It is a move that is likely to refocus the minds of rivals on price, after a year in which the chains were battling it out on green credentials and quality. However, few retail analysts expect any slowing in the trend towards sales of organic and higher-quality food products among Britain's middle classes. Sainsbury is in the midst of a programme of cutting \u00a3400m from prices to make it more competitive - regular surveys in The Grocer magazine showed Tesco was significantly cheaper on a basket of items. It appeared to be paying off with profits heading back up. In November, it reported like-for-like sales were ahead by 6.2%. The Tesco cuts come ahead of publication of the anxiously awaited initial findings from a Competition Commission inquiry into the grocery sector. The Office of Fair Trading referred the inquiry to the commission in the summer, and the early findings are due to be published this month. In its submission, Sainsbury warned that Tesco could have up to 43% of the grocery market within four years if the watchdog failed to take action to curtail its growth. At the time, Sainsbury said that Tesco had more than half of all the sites that were being developed into grocery outlets. Sainsbury, Waitrose, Morrisons and Asda want changes to the planning regime to allow them to compete more effectively. In October, Tesco chalked up half-year profits of more than \u00a31bn - only four years after first breaching the \u00a31bn level for a full year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
