According to the News Media Alliance, between 16% and 40% of Google search results are news content. Google\u2019s revenue from its distribution of news content is only $400m less than the $5.1bn brought in by the United States news industry as a whole from digital advertising last year. The industry body warned that the figures may in fact be conservative, since the report does not seek to include the value of users\u2019 personal data each time they use the search service to click on a story. But the study\u2019s methodology has been met with skepticism in some quarters. Bill Grueskin, professor of practice at Columbia University\u2019s prestigious journalism school described the News Alliance\u2019s $4.7bn revenue claim as \u201cfuzzy, at best\u201d. \u201cThe researchers appear to take a random, 2008 comment made at a conference, about Google News\u2019 value, and extrapolate that to come up with a number that\u2019s supposed to represent how much revenue that Google has made off the news business,\u201d Grueskin told the Guardian. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that big tech companies deserve scrutiny for their oversized role in the advertising business,\u201d Grueskin added. \u201cBut a trade group that represents the news business ought to have standards that match those of the reporters and editors they\u2019re trying to support.\u201d Google also criticized the study, arguing that it ignored the value Google provides and describing the calculations as \u201cinaccurate\u201d. \u201cEvery month Google News and Google Search drive over 10 billion clicks to publishers\u2019 websites, which drive subscriptions and significant ad revenue. We\u2019ve worked very hard to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to news publishers worldwide,\u201d a Google spokesperson said. Still, the report serves to underscore the news media\u2019s increasingly uncomfortable reliance on big tech for distribution, and exacerbate its long-held gripe that companies like Google, Facebook and Apple are disproportionately profiting from the arrangement. \u201cNews publishers need to continue to invest in quality journalism, and they can\u2019t do that if the platforms take what they want without paying for it,\u201d said David Chavern, the alliance\u2019s president, in an accompanying statement. \u201cInformation wants to be free, but reporters need to get paid.\u201d Big tech\u2019s distorting dominance of the news media, effectively controlling both the pricing and distribution of news production over all but a handful of publications behind a paywall, has long vexed the news industry. In 2009, Google News had approximately 24 million monthly unique visitors in the US, compared with 50 million for both CNN and the New York Times. By May 2018, Google had approximately 150 million unique monthly visitors in the US, close to double the numbers for CNN and the New York Times. Chavern will present the news media\u2019s case for a more equitable distribution of revenue before a congressional anti-trust subcommittee tomorrow, which is looking at the relationship between big tech companies and the media. The alliance hopes the outcome will be the passage of the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, a bill that would give news publishers a four-year antitrust exemption, allowing them to collectively bargain with the owners of online platforms over revenue splitting. The alliance argues that the new study first and foremost establishes the public\u2019s demand for news. \u201cNews content certainly drives a lot of user behavior,\u201d Chavern told the Guardian. \u201cIf anything, the value to Google we\u2019ve put on it is conservative, and I\u2019m sure if you were at Google looking out, the number would strike you as conservative.\u201d Chavern argues that both Google and Facebook could be good partners to the news business \u2013 if they chose to be. According to the report, since January 2017, traffic from Google Search to news publisher sites has risen by more than 25% to approximately 1.6bn visits per week in January 2018. Chavern describes Google and Facebook as \u201cwonderful distribution systems\u201d that are failing to honor their side of the content creation\u2013content distribution deal. Indeed, the report argues, with consumers\u2019 shift toward Google for news consumption, news is becoming increasingly important to Google to keep consumers within its digital domain. However, that growing dependence does not translate to greater revenue for publishers. Chavern said: \u201cThey just need to work with us to build a sustainable digital future for news and they haven\u2019t been willing to do that yet.\u201d The Alliance points out that the digital platforms are accustomed to paying for content \u2013 music, for instance \u2013 and argues that news should be no different. But when the digital platforms have been approached, Chavern said: \u201cThey say a lot of nice things but steadfastly refuse to pay for or improve the economic deal for news.\u201d It\u2019s possible that may change. Building political and regulatory pressure on big tech, including calls for Facebook to be broken up and widespread alarm over the role of the proliferation of fake news and its role in distorting the democratic process, has forced big tech on to the defensive. In recent weeks, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, has mounted what amounts to a media apology tour for not doing enough to combat election meddling, hate speech and the spread of misinformation \u2013 and to argue that Facebook should not be broken up by regulators."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
