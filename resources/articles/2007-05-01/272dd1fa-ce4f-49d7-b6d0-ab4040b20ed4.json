One of the most prolific session musicians in history and two times Grammy winner, he performed with a who's who of popular music, from Frank Sinatra to Frank Zappa, from John Lennon to Elton John, and from Paul Simon to Carly Simon. Add names like James Brown, Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen, Parliament/Funkadelic, Lou Reed, Dire Straits and Aerosmith and you get an idea of his range. And oh yes, he played a bit of jazz. Pilgrimage was his valedictory statement after a two-year battle with leukaemia, which ended on 13 January this year. He was working on the album until days before his death, but you'd never guess it from the energy and exuberance of his solos. Take 'Wing and a Prayer', for example. It tells you a lot about how he influenced generations of fellow musicians. Quite apart from all the technical guff so beloved of the saxophone community, it's his tone and rhythmic vitality that draw you into his music. Like a modern day snake-charmer his solos are both seductive and hypnotic, transfixing you with unexpected melodic twists and musical turns. Brecker based his style on one of the greats of contemporary jazz, John Coltrane, who died in 1967. Coltrane wrote the manifesto for saxophone playing which is now part of standard jazz pedagogy (and one reason why all saxophonists seem to sound so similar these days), but Brecker came along and actually built and expanded on that legacy. It was no mean achievement - rather like going up the north face of the Eiger on roller skates. Although he was only 57 when he died, he didn't make an album under his own name until he was 38. But Michael Brecker was so good it was like a successful first novel - almost impossible to follow. Once he'd got it out of his system, subsequent albums - and there were seven of them - were frustratingly so-so in comparison. Yet Pilgrimage is a powerful epitaph because it's up there with Michael Brecker. Is that why he was so driven to get it completed when drained by chemotherapy and clinging on to life? You only have to listen to '5/4', 'Anagram' or 'Loose Threads' to realise he's saying 'I'm still the boss'. And he is.
