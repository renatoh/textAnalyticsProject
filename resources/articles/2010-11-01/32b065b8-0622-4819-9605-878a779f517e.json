It is both ponderous and ridiculous. The ghost of Sophocles, author of Oedipus the King, from which this takes its cue, chides himself for not having written plays like Pasolini. Lucky for us he didn't: the Italian may have been a distinctive film-maker but he had little grasp of the theatre. Even in Italy, his plays are largely ignored. In her first production for this new venue, Lucy Bailey tries to treat the whole thing as if it's a movie, placing the audience on three sides of the gravel-pit filled stage and having us peer through a wide peep-hole style slit. At times, the lighting creates an almost hallucinatory quality as Jasper Britton's wealthy factory owner wakes from a terrible dream and spends the next 100 minutes going noisily insane, fuelled by religious mania, sexual jealousy and paternal confusions while his stylish wife looks on and smokes. It is clearly going to end badly, and it does. There is much strangely dated talk of the bourgeoisie in the florid translation, but also one rather intriguing scene when the father visits a fortune teller, which has both dramatic tension and an interestingly unknowable quality. But the rest of the evening feels like falling into a diseased and overwrought phallic fantasy. It would be unbearable were it not for the quality of the performances from the heroic actors, particularly Jasper Britton as the crazed father and Max Bennett as his bewildered son."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
