The government wanted 90% of referrals by GPs to run through the system by March, but usage is well below that. However the figures hide a more complex picture, with some GPs enthusiastic about the system and others critical. \"Clearly, the target isn't going to be met everywhere,\" says Dr Mark Davies, medical director for Choose &amp; Book at Connecting for Health (CfH) - the government agency responsible for the NHS IT programme - which runs the service. Usage is currently at 37% and he now expects the 90% target to be met nationally later this year. Choose &amp; Book has form in lateness, although the system itself was delivered on time by contractor Atos Origin for a start-up cost of \u00a3196m, making it a relatively small part of the \u00a36.2bn national programme. In January 2005, a National Audit Office report said it should have processed 205,000 patients by the end of 2004 but had managed just 63, while in September 2005 none of England's primary care trusts met an initial target of using the system for half their referrals. Dr Davies says Choose &amp; Book has now been used for more than 2 million patients' initial appointments, and the national average hides a wide range of local usage. Twenty-six of England's 152 primary care trusts are processing more than 50% of referrals through Choose &amp; Book, with \"several\" above 70%, according to CfH figures. The system is available to all PCTs, and 87% of GP practices made a referral through it during January and February. \"There is a mistake that people view Choose &amp; Book as an IT system,\" says Dr Davies. \"Of course the boxes and wires are important, but they are not the limiting factors. Choose &amp; Book represents a radical change in the way we do business in the NHS.\" Somerset has used Choose &amp; Book since September 2005, and put 95.2% of non-cancer referrals through it in December. It believes that exceeding 90% in that month made it eligible for a cash award from the Department of Health - although CfH says that no trust qualified for this, and that the county's usage was 83% in February. Quibbles about numbers aside, Somerset has got much further than most PCTs, something Kevin Hudson, programme manager for Choose &amp; Book in Somerset and West Dorset, puts down to two reasons. The first is local flexibility, based on consultation with the county's GPs. This includes a call centre in Bridgwater which helps patients choose where to have treatment based on a shortlist provided by their doctor, and choices on how the system works in each GP surgery, allowing doctors to pass work to medical secretaries if they prefer - 65% do so. \"We found by putting in flexibility of how GPs use the system, and saying use it in the way you see fit, GPs work very well with it,\" says Hudson. The other reason is that Somerset patients are used to travelling to a variety of locations for treatment, as the county does not have a dominant hospital. There are two district hospitals, an independent treatment centre in Shepton Mallet and several major hospitals just outside the county. The Bridgwater call centre helps patients with their choices. Hudson says most choose on the basis of how long it will take them to get to a hospital - the call centre also runs the area's patient transport advice line - and its waiting times, rather than clinical record or infection rates. \"When patients have information, many choose the shortest wait,\" he says, with 70% selecting the independent centre when it is an option, with a relatively short four-week wait. Dr Mayur Lakhani, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners and a Leicestershire GP, says Choose &amp; Book is sometimes let down by hospitals failing to list appointment slots - some areas have attempted to use the system to manage demand and save money - or by technical problems. \"When it works, it is really very good, but it's inconsistent,\" he says. \"The system can be down, and we're not quite sure why. The IT stuff needs to be there every day, and it's got to work. You've only got a few minutes.\" Dr Davies says CfH is tackling the first problem by telling patients to call NHS Direct's Choose &amp; Book advice line if there are no appointments available, so its staff can liaise with that hospital. \"Now we've introduced that, trusts can't hide behind Choose &amp; Book,\" he says. As for technical problems, CfH says the system was available for more than 99.2% of the last 12 months. He says that local problems with networks and computers cause some of the difficulties blamed on Choose &amp; Book. Dr Davies adds that some doctors \"are not particularly bought into\" patient choice, and transfer that distaste to the system which handles it. A poll by medical pollsters Medix in November found that half of GPs use the system for more than 40% of referrals. But among these regular users, 90% say it increases the time taken to refer a patient to hospital and 70% think it is detrimental to patient care or makes no difference. Dr Lakhani says controversy over choice may have contributed to the wide range of usage across England, as lack of enthusiasm from GPs, PCTs or secondary care can undermine Choose &amp; Book in an area. He adds that he is often surprised by his own patients' choices, but that this is part of a move from passive patients to active ones. \"It's not a chattering class debate with GPs and IT people,\" he says of the system's future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
