What better day for a 73-year-old consumer advocate Ralph Nader to launch the latest chapter in his increasingly bizarre Sunset Boulevard-type coda to an honourable career? \"All right, Mr de Mille, I'm ready for my close up,\" Norma Desmond, the geriatric has-been movie star with delusions of grandeur, says, in one of the most famous lines in cinema history, as she fades into a fantasy world within which she remains the diva. Nader seems to have entered a similarly deluded, and cloistered, world. He went onto an NBC morning show, Meet the Press, on Sunday to tell the audience he was entering the race for the presidency \"to shift the power from the few to the many.\" Let's parse this statement a little. Here's a man widely seen as performing a sabotage role in the 2000 presidential election that helped propel George Bush to power; in 2004, he attempted a redux, and his vote sank from 2.7% to a dismal 0.3%. Now, in 2008, Nader is arguing that the most energizing primary season in modern American history, one that has brought tens of millions of voters out across the country - especially the young voters whom Nader has always most appealed to - is all about \"the few.\" Meanwhile, he, Nader, who hasn't criss-crossed the country for months addressing crowds, debating policy choices or bringing out voters, is somehow about \"the many.\" As they say in New York: \"Who ya kidding?\" Nader's argument is that the two parties are two sides of the same corrupt coin, and that their policies somehow represent a conspiracy of consensus designed to exclude the multitudes from political participation. I'm sorry, but anyone who thinks there's no difference between Obama or Clinton and Bush or McCain has more than a couple of screws loose. Anyone who listens to Obama on Iraq and concludes he represents the same vision Bush has for the Middle East has been smoking something pretty strong. Anyone who can't see that this election actually might result in a president being elected who will fight for a massive overhaul of the healthcare system, for increased wages for low-income Americans, for an end to legalized torture and cowboy diplomacy, is a person with myopia to the point of blindness. Does that mean the Democratic candidates are perfect? Of course not. But if Nader didn't like the positions they were pushing, he could have jumped into the fray months ago. Here's the second part of his absurd reasoning. Somehow, the primary system is designed, according to Nader, to close down political options. But, wait a minute - the Democratic contests are now almost all open primaries. What that means is independents as well as registered Democrats can, and in huge numbers do, vote in them. That's part of the reason Obama's been performing so well, because independents have flocked to his campaign. Now, if Nader really wanted to expand the voice of independents, he could have put his name down as a Democratic party candidate, and aggressively courted the tens of millions he believes to be currently voiceless. That, however, wouldn't have been at all to his taste. He would have been one among many candidates, would have received one or two per cent of the vote, and would have then had to gracefully cede the spotlight. This way's so much better. He can enter the race with the messianic rhetoric of being a saviour; he can serve as, at best, a spoiler, come November; and he can guarantee himself another few months of headlines before he fades into permanent obscurity. Rage, rage, against the dying of the light, Dylan Thomas memorably wrote. A good maxim to live, and die by. I only wish Nader, who once upon a time actually was a champion of the underdog and a positive force in American politics, could find a more productive, less obnoxious, way to rage his way through the winter years of his life. Once upon a time the name Ralph Nader was synonymous with the best reform impulses in American politics. These days, he's just another Lyndon LaRouche, the perennial ego maniac with fascist tendencies, who, since the 1960s, has built up a small cult of followers on campuses around the country.
