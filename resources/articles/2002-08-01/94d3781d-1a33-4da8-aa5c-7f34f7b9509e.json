I was told to call a special number the next day, but it was permanently on answerphone: \"All agents are busy... for an attendant press zero.\" Zero routes you to a voice saying you haven't specified your log-in. Hours of hassle later, I got an Alitalia official on a line somewhere at Heathrow who said give her half an hour. Hours passed, I rang again. \"If I look for your bag,\" she said exasperatedly, \"people who have been waiting for five days will have to wait. We have hundreds of bags here, we have missing bag files coming out of our ears.\" It seemed best to go to Heathrow. Getting into Terminal 2's baggage hall entailed thorough security screening. But once in the hall, the absence of security was mind boggling. Alitalia's lost bags operation is run by three harassed people in a stifling office by a carousel. Another passenger, Jocelyn Stevenson, executive vice-president of HIT Entertainment, was also there, having failed to get through on the phone for two days. Somewhat surprisingly, the Alitalia people suggested we look for our bags ourselves in the baggage hall. As we walked around, we were mesmerised by the hundreds of bags piled around the walls. Some were open - we stumbled on one destined for Newark, the contents of which were spilling out. Two officials whom we alerted said it had been like that all day, and rushed on. We asked another airline representative whether this bag situation was normal. \"It's summer, what do you expect?\" she snapped, as we frowned at a horrible smell emanating from a bag nearby. The Guardian asked the British Airports Authority (BAA) for an explanation and a spokeswoman said: \"Alitalia and Air France may have experienced problems due to baggage handler strikes... \" Interestingly, this explanation was not used by anybody in the hall that day. Returning bagless to the Alitalia office, it transpired that our luggage wasn't on the bagtracking computer programme. The tags must have come off, they explained. Stevenson had checked her bag on to a flight from Catania direct to London, although she changed planes in Milan. Surely the barcoded computerised tag would show which flight the bag had been put on to? No, they said, barcodes are just for sorting bags on to the right planes. This means bags can get on to planes minus owners, something Stevenson and I thought couldn't happen post Lockerbie and September 11. \"Bags quite often go on planes without passengers if they have been X-rayed,\" says James Fremantle of the Air Transport Users Council (AUC), which this week reported the latest results of the most common complaint - baggage mishandling. But Stevenson and I surely aren't the only people who have sat in planes on runways while passengerless bags are removed for security reasons. \"Doesn't this chaotic state of affairs raise security issues?\" Stevenson asked. Not according to BAA: \"We do not consider bags in the baggage reclaim hall a security risk as they will have already been screened and searched before they arrive at Heathrow.\" It doesn't take a conspiracy theorist to work out how these bags could be tampered with. Airlines are responsible for lost bags, but the BAA is responsible for overall security in the baggage hall and for co-ordinating security. \"BAA invests over \u00a3140m on security annually,\" says its website. \"Since September 11, [we] have invested an additional \u00a310m... \" So why aren't lost bags stored safely? \"BAA may provide a secure area for airlines to store bags that arrive at Heathrow... this is a sterile area where bags cannot be tampered with.\" How a bag qualifies for the sterile area isn't clear. There is a caged section in Terminal 2 baggage hall, but nobody challenged me when I strolled in and scrutinised luggage with date tags going back five weeks. We could have helped ourselves to any bag we fancied, as we pointed out to a passing official. \"You couldn't,\" he said. \"Customs would get you.\" Another said it had not happened yet, but how would they know? Nobody checked us when we left. I got my bag back after several maddening hours in the Alitalia bunker. I had been there five hours, during which time the person handling the case said she hadn't been able to get through to Rome's Fiumicino airport all day and she couldn't find a bag like mine. But then I looked at their computer records and realised that they were looking for the wrong kind of holdall. When they finally found a likely suspect - in Fiumicino airport - it couldn't be opened and identified for security reasons. Eventually, someone in Rome asked if I had green sandals, and the bag winged its way home. The bag mountains aren't unusual. The AUC says it gets \"plenty of complaints about bags stacked up and left all over the place in airports all over the world. Virtually anything you can think of happens because of a lack of regulation covering baggage handling.\" How reassuring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
