Believe me, I have been there and done that. I was in a four-by-four, but on a camel, you are close to insanity (closer than you think)! The Sahara is massive; it took us weeks to get across - weeks of sand and rock and salt and sand. We could carry only so much water, and it was not long before the restrictions on personal hygiene had us yearning for clean clothes, sand-free skin and clean, cold flowing water. If you are so bold as to cross with camels, please be aware that women might not be welcome as single travellers in some regions. A far more comfortable solution would be to visit Morocco and arrange a trip 'into' the Sahara rather than 'across' it. These trips last from one day to four days and involve guides with invaluable local knowledge (the length of time it took us to cross had more than a little to do with getting lost). I suggest you go to a library and order some guide books on Morocco or Egypt and take things from there. Andrew Black"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
