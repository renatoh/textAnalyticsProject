A market share of 25% is usually enough to trigger an investigation, yet Tesco now controls over 30% of the grocery market. The OFT didn't want to take this route, but had its hand forced by a legal challenge from a wide coalition of pressure groups that included the WI, farmers, small shopkeepers and environmentalists. The depth of public unease at the dominance of the big four is perhaps reflected by the fact that both the Tories and the Lib Dems now want an urgent review of the whole sector. Labour, whose voter-friendly Rip Off Britain campaign back in 1998 backfired when the commission cleared supermarkets of price fixing in 2000, has been noticeably quiet this time, however. The revolving door between Tesco and Downing Street may in part explain this, but the bigger reason is that supermarket abuse of power is the only thing keeping inflation down. With fuel prices rising dramatically and council taxes going up, deflation in retailing has played a vital role in maintaining Labour's image as prudent managers of the economy. So will the commission do anything to rein in the big four? It will depend on the scope it is allowed for its investigation. There will be intense pressure from the big retailers to keep the terms of reference narrow, while all those other sectors under threat - clothing, electrical goods, pharmacies, bookshops, CD and DVD sellers, newsagents - try to make sure a larger review is conducted. The latter group will be rowing against the tide. So much damage has already been done to our high streets and our food and farming system. Our competition law now defines the consumer interest so narrowly that most ordinary people's concerns are unlikely to be addressed. Food miles, labour conditions, environmental damage, farmers going out of business, poor people losing access to shops, none of these fit into a definition of a competitive market that assumes consumers are fine so long as everything is cheap. (Not that good fresh food is cheaper in supermarkets; the New Economics Foundation and Friends of the Earth have shown it's not, and that markets do better on price.) And here's another fine example of the imbalance of power between supermarkets and the rest of the world. The big retailers are estimated to have spent \u00a320m defending themselves during the last Competition Commission inquiry. The total annual budget for the CC, to include all its other work, is just over \u00a320m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
