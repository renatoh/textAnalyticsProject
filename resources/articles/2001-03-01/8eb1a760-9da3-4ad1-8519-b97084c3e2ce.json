Apparently England's coach Sven-Goran Eriksson was so impressed by the atmosphere at Newcastle's 52,000-seat stadium that the club will now host their fifth ever England game, but the first since a 4-0 win over Norway 63 years ago. The Albania game comes only five days after the fixture with Germany in Munich, and England's qualification hopes may well be in the balance. Newcastle's chairman Freddy Shepherd said: \"If we're fighting for points in the last games they'll certainly get the Newcastle folk behind them, I'll tell you that. The Geordies aren't slow coming forward and they'll get right behind the England team.\" It was this which registered with Eriksson. \"He's been here a couple of times and I think he was just amazed by the stadium and by the strength of the support and noise that's generated,\" said the Football Association's director of marketing Paul Barber It was also the ground's capacity which attracted the FA. Newcastle have spent around \u00a370m to develop the stadium into the second biggest in the Premiership, after Old Trafford. Around 5,000 tickets will be specifically reserved for local schoolchildren and priced at \u00a311 - half the lowest adult admission price. Adam Crozier is keen to revive the Scotland-England fixture and discussed the idea with his Scottish FA counterpart David Taylor at last weekend's meeting of Fifa's International Board in Edinburgh. Crozier, a Scot and also the Football Association's chief executive, admits that the chances of resurrecting a tournament involving the four home countries are slim but remains optimistic about the chances of reviving the world's oldest international fixture, with the teams facing each other every two years. \"Both sides are looking at it positively, but the congested fixture calendar is a problem,\" Crozier said. \"There is a will to revive the fixture but it's a question of logistics.\" Scotland and England first met in 1872, a 0-0 draw in Glasgow, and the match became an annual event until 1989 when persistent crowd trouble led to the respective FAs deciding to call time on it. The Wales manager Mark Hughes has named Cardiff's Andy Legg, 34, who last played for his country three years ago, and Nottingham Forest's Christian Edwards, who has one cap but has not figured since moving from Swansea two years ago, in his squad for this month's World Cup qualifiers with Armenia and Ukraine four days later. Huddersfield's full-back Steve Jenkins joins them along with Robbie Savage. Although the Leicester midfielder is banned for the match in Yerevan on March 24 he can play when Ukraine visit Cardiff four days later. Wales squad: Jones (Soton), Freestone (Swansea), Crossley (N Forest), Ward (N County), Delaney (A Villa), Jenkins (Huddersfield), Barnard (Barnsley), Roberts (Tranmere), Edwards (N Forest), Legg (Cardiff), Melville, Symons (both Fulham), Page (Watford), Robinson (Charlton), Johnson (N Forest), Jones, Savage (both Leicester), Pembridge (Everton), Robinson (Wolves), Speed (Newcastle), Saunders (Bradford), Roberts (Norwich), Bellamy, Hartson (both Coventry), Blake (Blackburn), Giggs (Man Utd)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
