Most places had some early-week snow but warm temperatures create avalanche dangers. Not so in North America where, thanks to greater resort heights and smaller vertical drops, there is usually far less difference in snow depth readings between the upper and lower slopes. Andorra: Warm temperatures early last week meant slushy pistes at Arinsal (75cm on lower slopes, 115cm higher up). Similar at Pas de la Casa (80/110cm), while pistes were hard at Pal (70/110cm) and tired at Soldeu (50/110cm) despite some small falls. More snow needed. Austria: My source in Mayrhofen (0/145cm) said the pistes were good, (there is often no snow at village level) while off-piste midweek had spring snow. Conditions were expected to stay good despite the resort being full. The snowboard park on Penken is described as 'wicked'. Ischgl, (30/200cm) always innovative, is boasting of being the first resort to organise a 'beach' volley ball tournament on the snow. It starts on Saturday for eight days. The world's best players are due to battle it out in a stadium fashioned of ice with sand spread over the snow. At the home of serious skiing, St Anton (65/310cm) the pistes were packed powder, lower runs were slushy, while off-piste was varied with a moderate avalanche risk. Obergurgl (20/220cm) had excellent piste but slushy resort runs. Bulgaria: Borovets and Pamporovo (5/20cm) are struggling. Poiana Brasov in Romania had better depths (40/135cm) but only fair pistes. Canada: Lake Louise (70/90cm) and Whistler (120/1800cm) reported pleasantly packed pistes. France: There were difficulties for many resorts after a Poma gondola cabin came off its cable in Serre Chevalier (80/410cm after yet more snow) injuring four passengers. The authorities, fearing a repeat, responded by closing 28 similar gondolas in various ski areas, installed between 1960 and 1980. This is playing havoc with uphill lift capacity and links. In the Three Valleys, Courchevel (15/105cm) closed four gondolas and Les Menuires (30/140cm) two. In Haute Savoie, Les Contamines (5/120cm), Flaine (20/320cm), Les Gets (30/120cm), Les Houches (15/150cm), Meg\u00e9ve (30/105cm), Samoens (20/315cm), and Thollon (40/90cm) each closed a gondola, while further south Les Deux Alpes (20/170cm), Isola (190/410cm) and two less well-known resorts have shut gondolas as have Bar\u00e9ges and La Mongie (each 35/90cm) and Les Cauterets (100/200) in the Pyrenees. It is not yet clear if they will be allowed to reopen before the ski season finishes soon after Easter. The locals in M\u00e9ribel (40/120cm) are hoping for heavy falls as, by their reckoning, it should be a late snow year. Tignes (90/270cm) is 'heavy' off-piste and only fair on. Italy: There was still a lot of snow, some of it dangerous. In Sestriere (100/200cm) an off-piste avalanche killed one skier, and injured three. Elsewhere, Madonna di Campiglio (80/240cm) had good higher pistes, wet lower ones (too sunny) and considerable off-piste avalanche risks. Cervinia (130/320cm) had glorious sunny skiing but high avalanche risk. Cortina (30/200cm) was also doing well in warm weather with considerable off-piste risks. The lower runs had been closed Norway: Voss (100/110cm) had better depths and was expecting more snow. Despite some snowfall, depths at Hemsedal (120/190cm) and Geilo (115/130cm) had not changed, perhaps because it was warmer than of late. In Sweden, heavy snow and strong winds delayed the season's last World Cup downhill at Are (70/90cm). Switzerland: St Moritz (170/340cm) after early-week snow was enjoying excellent conditions tempered by avalanche risks. At Wengen (5/90cm) pistes were heavy. Verbier (55/200cm) had excellent pistes and 'pure powder' off-piste but with high risks attached. US: Even more snow in California at Mammoth (305/335cm) though it was expected to be mostly clear later with great crowds driving up from Los Angeles for the weekend. Heavenly (120/220cm) was completely open and looking forward to some sunny spells. Throughout the Rockies mid-mountain snow depths were still respectable: Jackson Hole reported 145cm, Aspen 99cm, Winter Park 165cm, Copper Mountain 132cm, Crested Butte 119cm, Keystone 114cm, Telluride 149cm and Vail 114cm. All resorts were fully open with packed powder pistes. On the slopes: Keifer Sutherland has been taking a ski holiday in Whistler. Best skiing: Courmayeur (80/350cm), departing Sunday 18 March, seven nights at Chalet Hotel Christallo, \u00a3450pp sharing, including flights and transfers.
