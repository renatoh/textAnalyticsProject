Ars\u00e8ne Wenger hopes the gap left by Emmanuel Petit's departure last summer will finally be plugged. The Arsenal manager has told Van Bronckhorst that he plans to use him as Vieira's sidekick, and the left-footed Holland international should provide the balance which has been lacking since Petit's move to Barcelona. Gilles Grimandi and Ray Parlour, both right-footed players, were unable to complement Vieira, and the arrival of Edu from Brazil was reduced to farce by passport problems and injury. Van Bronckhorst is confident his partnership with Vieira will flourish. \"I'm looking forward to playing with him,\" said the 21-cap 26-year-old, who scored 22 goals in 119 games for Rangers. \"Vieira is a great player who has won almost everything. He's a World Cup winner and a European Championship winner. Of course we have to get used to each other, but I think we can be a good couple.\" Van Bronckhorst signed a five-year contract after a tough medical which stretched over two days. Groin injuries had restricted him to only 45 minutes for Rangers since October, and he faced a nervous wait before learning he had satisfied Arsenal's requirements. \"At the beginning I wasn't worried because I felt really good, but if it takes so long you think maybe it won't go through,\" he said. \"It was a long wait in the hotel with my wife and father but [yesterday] I got the final call to say everything was fine.\" He blames his initial injury on too much football - \"I was empty; my body said 'no more'\" - and saw his comeback against Hearts in March cut short by another groin problem. Van Bronckhorst, who began his career at Feyenoord and left for Rangers for \u00a35m in 1998, was also wanted by Chelsea among others. After talking with his compatriot Dennis Bergkamp and meeting Wenger on Friday, he opted for Arsenal. The Dutchman's arrival follows the signing of Francis Jeffers and takes Arsenal's spending to \u00a316.5m this summer. Wenger is waiting to learn whether he will land Sol Campbell and also wants a goalkeeper, with Feyenoord's Jerzy Dudek his prime target. Rangers responded to the departure of Van Bronckhorst by agreeing terms with Borussia Dortmund for the midfielder Christian Nerlinger. Rangers will pay around \u00a32.5m for the German, who will fly to Glasgow for negotiations this week. Blackburn, meanwhile, remain confident that their attempt to sign Rangers' Tugay Kerimoglu will prove successful despite the Home Office yesterday refusing to grant him a work permit. The Rovers manager Graeme Souness, who coached Tugay at Galatasaray, had agreed a fee of \u00a31.3m for the 27-year-old defensive midfielder, who has 59 caps for Turkey. But Tugay has fallen foul of red tape, having dropped out of the national side through injury. \"Tugay played in 71% of international matches over the last two seasons, falling short of the 75% requirement,\" said Blackburn's secretary Tom Finn. \"We remain confident of signing him in due course.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
