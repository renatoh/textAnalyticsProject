It centres on high-flying, hard-ass LA business executive Amy (Laura Dern), who has a nervous breakdown in front of her equally high-flying, hard-ass colleagues and then returns to work after a three-month retreat in Hawaii and a spiritual awakening that causes her to twirl round the place saying things like: \"You can change and be an agent of change.\" I have a pathological aversion to hippie shit under any circumstances, but even allowing for the fact that I could immediately start slapping Amy from here to Sunday and back, the show has many problems. Tonally, it's all over the place. One minute it's gentle whimsy, the next weak corporate drama, the next even weaker corporate satire, interspersed with scenes that alternately parody and praise the self-help movement. Amy swings wildly from pseudo-Zen calm (\"By visualising the change you summon it to you\") to original, corporate-issue Amy (getting her old job back by threatening a lawsuit, albeit with a calm, pseudo-Zen smile). This could and should be a source of dramatic conflict and comedy tension as she tries to reconcile her new aspirations with her old way of life, but as she never seems to notice what she's doing, simply jumping from mood to mood without reflection, the changes leave the viewer disorientated and disengaged. The only constant is her dislikability. And her relentless armwaving, though that's really a subset of the other. Everyone, from mother to co-worker, hates her in either guise, and it's hard not to suspect the same goes for viewers too. The non-central characters, by contrast, are wonderful, pitch-perfect creations \u2013 particularly the multitude of oddballs with whom Amy is sent to work in the dataprocessing basement, from the nameless man with an assortment of rutting comicbook figurines on his desk to Dougie and his tales of dating women with nosebleeds who eventually have to have the exsanguinating organ removed \"because of tumours. The tumours were causing the nosebleeds.\" You could lift out Amy and let them close seamlessly and ungesticulatingly over the hole and have a blindingly brilliant show. Let's hope someone sees the light."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
