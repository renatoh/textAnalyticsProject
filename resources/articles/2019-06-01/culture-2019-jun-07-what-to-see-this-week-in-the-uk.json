Mindy Kaling \u2013 who also scripted \u2013 co-stars as an aspiring standup whose \u201cdiversity hire\u201d causes much panic in the all-white, all-male writers\u2019 room. Gloria Bell (15) (Sebasti\u00e1n Lelio, 2018, Chi/US) 102 mins Following the acclaimed lesbian drama Disobedience last year, Lelio\u2019s remake of his own 2013 arthouse hit Gloria moves the action from Santiago, Chile, to LA. Julianne Moore stars as the title character, a divorcee with two grownup children who stumbles upon a potential new partner at a singles bar, in this brilliantly acted, adult character study. Halston (12A) (Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Tcheng, 2019, US) 105 mins Halston was once the biggest deal in women\u2019s fashion, rising from milliner to the First Lady \u2013 he created Jackie O\u2019s pillbox hat \u2013 to Saks Fifth Avenue superstar and Studio 54 hellraiser. This doc traces his rise and self-inflicted fall, with testimony from those who were there and \u2013 in the case of former party animals Liza Minnelli and Joel Schumacher \u2013 possibly not all there. Kind Hearts and Coronets (U) (Robert Hamer, 1949, UK) 102 mins As a clash of class divisions continues to drive wedges in modern British society, there has never been a better time to revisit this jet-black comedy, restored for its 70th birthday. Dennis Price stars as the son of a disgraced aristocrat who takes revenge for his dead mother by murdering her bloodline, all played \u2013 even the women \u2013 by Alec Guinness. Booksmart (15) (Olivia Wilde, 2019, US) 102 mins Following the likes of Eighth Grade and Support the Girls, Booksmart arrives at a good time for female-fronted indie cinema, with the added bonus of a woman behind the camera. Olivia Wilde\u2019s debut is its own sweet thing: a funny and touching comedy about a pair of graduating high-school girls who realise that studying hard and partying harder aren\u2019t as mutually exclusive as they thought. DW Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop Parklife Kickstarting the official beginning of the festival season is Manchester\u2019s Parklife, which offers up a properly amazing selection of music\u2019s finest, from Solange to Yaeji to Cardi B via Kaytranada and Christine and the Queens. Or, if none of that floats your boat, you could cry at Mark Ronson\u2019s sad bangers, croon along with Khalid, or go and get a drink while Chase &amp; Status are on. Heaton Park, Manchester, Saturday 8 &amp; Sunday 9 June Tame Impala Four long years have passed since Australian psych rockers Tame Impala released third album Currents. Earlier this year, two new songs \u2013 the typically widescreen double whammy of Patience and Borderline \u2013 suggested they were about to unleash a follow-up but it\u2019s all gone quiet again. Still, there will be enough here to keep your mind frazzled while we wait. The O2, SE10, Saturday 8; touring to 26 June Erykah Badu, Jhen\u00e9 Aiko After previously playing the return of the hugely influential Long Beach-based R&amp;B festival Smokin\u2019 Grooves in 2018, two of the genre\u2019s more experimental exponents arrive in UK for a co-headline show. It\u2019s not clear who will be doing what and when, or if Aiko and Badu will collaborate, so best just to sit back and let it all wash over you. The O2, SE10, Sunday 9 June Backstreet Boys Proving that you shouldn\u2019t underestimate nostalgia and precision-tooled choreography, ageing boyband the Backstreet Boys scored their first US No 1 album in 19 years in January with DNA. It went Top 10 in the UK too, hence another arena tour. Expect a smattering from that collection but obviously only stand up when it comes to those classic early 00s bops and bangers. Manchester Arena, Monday 10; The SSE Hydro, Glasgow, Friday 14; touring to 18 June MC Tori Freestone Trio Tori Freestone\u2019s favourite resources \u2013 unplugged sax, bass and drums \u2013 might be unassuming, but the stories she and her trio tell are vividly eloquent. An alert, uncliched improviser but also a subtle song-cherisher (she\u2019s also a folk violinist), Freestone here tours her new trio album, El Mar de Nubes. Bristol, Saturday 8; Southampton, Sunday 9; Sheffield, Wednesday 12; Newcastle upon Tyne, Thursday 13; touring to 18 June JF Three of the best ... classical concerts Weimar Berlin: The Sounds of Change One of the features of Esa-Pekka Salonen\u2019s decade as the principal conductor of the Philharmonia has been themed series. The latest focuses on Germany between the two world wars, particularly Berlin during the Weimar republic. All the usual suspects are represented in the two concerts this week. Salonen conducts the first, with music by Berg, Hindemith, Weill and Shostakovich, while Thursday\u2019s is devoted to a screening of Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis, with the Philharmonia playing Gottfried Huppertz\u2019s original score. Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Sunday 9 &amp; Thursday 13 June Fantasio Garsington Opera\u2019s third new show celebrates the bicentenary of the birth of Jacques Offenbach with the first UK staging of his 1872 op\u00e9ra comique. Fantasio is a typical melange of disguise and thwarted love, with the title role of the dreamer in love with an unattainable princess played by a mezzo-soprano. Here, that\u2019s Hanna Hipp, with Jennifer France as the princess. It is directed by Martin Duncan; Justin Doyle conducts. Wormsley Estate, nr High Wycombe, Friday 14 June to 20 July Il Paria Opera Rara\u2019s raison d\u2019etre is to revive forgotten 19th-century operas and its latest project is a work by Donizetti. Despite some dramatic flaws, 1829\u2019s Il Paria (The Outcast) was regarded as the composer\u2019s finest achievement up to that point, but it was never really successful and Donizetti recycled some of its music in other operas. Albina Shagimuratova and Celso Albelo lead the cast as Mark Elder conducts the Britten Sinfonia in a concert performance. Barbican Hall, EC2, Saturday 8 June AC Five of the best ... exhibitions Keith Haring New York City in the 1980s was a huge canvas for Keith Haring, who created his own graphic language of simplified human figures bopping in a nightclub that never closed and used it in everything from street art to canvases and posters. His pop cartoons have influenced animation from The Simpsons to Rick and Morty. His optimism lifts you up. Tate Liverpool, Friday 14 June to 10 November Kiss My Genders Art that challenges fixed and binary identities and explores new ways of seeing our carnality comes to the Hayward in a summer of sexual subversion. Artists in this gender-fluid blockbuster include Joan Jett Blakk, Catherine Opie, Planningtorock, Athi-Patra Ruga and Del LaGrace Volcano. Hayward Gallery, SE1, Wednesday 12 June to 8 September Bartolom\u00e9 Bermejo A red-eyed devil cowers at the feet of a Christian warrior in Bermejo\u2019s powerful painting St Michael Triumphs Over the Devil. This vision of holy war was painted in Spain in 1468 during a century of Christian \u201creconquest\u201d. Jews came under increasing pressure to convert while the Muslim Spanish kingdom Al-Andalus was defeated. Bermejo\u2019s art shows the making of this new imperial, Christian Spain. The National Gallery, WC2, Wednesday 12 June to 29 September Summer Exhibition 2019 The RA\u2019s annual exhibition of the good, the bad and, who knows, perhaps even the beautiful, got a lift last year when Grayson Perry turned it into a psychological carnival. The latest instalment continues that contemporary edge with Mat Collishaw, Polly Morgan and more creating a \u201cmenagerie\u201d of perverted nature, and such stalwarts as Anselm Kiefer and Tracey Emin showing among less famous names. Royal Academy of Arts, W1, Monday 10 June to 12 August NOW: Anya Gallaccio Gallaccio uses the stuff of nature to make sculptures, bringing flowers, trees, wax and ice into the gallery. She is a very 21st-century exponent of an organic and ecological style of art-making that started with Italy\u2019s arte povera movement in the 1960s. This survey of the current art scene also points to images of natural processes in the works of Roger Hiorns and Charles Avery. Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, to 22 September JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows Sweat Book your tickets pronto: Lynn Nottage\u2019s Pulitzer prize-winning play, directed by Lynette Linton, transfers to the West End for 50 performances only. Set in Pennsylvania between 2000 and 2008, Sweat explores the impact of deindustrialisation on factory worker friends, with a cast that includes Martha Plimpton. The play is based on two years of interviews and rings loud and true. Gielgud Theatre, W1, to 20 July Bitter Wheat Who\u2019s up for the world premiere of a David Mamet play about a depraved, Harvey Weinstein-esque Hollywood mogul? It doesn\u2019t sound hugely appealing, I\u2019ll admit, but Mamet\u2019s scabrous wit could work really well in this context. The big draw, of course, is John Malkovich, returning to the West End after a 30-year break. Mamet himself directs. Garrick Theatre, WC2, to 21 September Plenty David Hare\u2019s play is a bit like Hedda Gabler: the Second World War Years. The action revolves around Susan Traherne, a former secret agent who can\u2019t find her place in a peaceful England; a world without danger, purpose or, for most of the women in Britain, meaningful employment. Rachael Stirling plays the title role. It\u2019s a gargantuan part, previously taken by the likes of Cate Blanchett, Rachel Weisz and Meryl Streep. Chichester Festival Theatre, to 29 June The Pope In 2013, Pope Benedict XVI resigned \u2013 an unprecedented move that shocked the world. The surprise replacement for the arch-conservative? Cardinal Bergoglio, a tango-dancing, football-loving reformer. What drove this changing of the guard and what might it mean for the future of the church? James Dacre directs Anton Lesser and Nicholas Woodeson in a new play from Anthony McCarten, writer of the film Bohemian Rhapsody. Royal &amp; Derngate: The Royal, Northampton, Saturday 8 to 22 June Hobson\u2019s Choice Harold Brighouse\u2019s popular comedy has been brightly adapted by Tanika Gupta. The action has been shifted to 1980s Manchester and its Ugandan-Asian community. Henry Hobson the shoemaker is now Hari the tailor (Tony Jayawardena) but the nuts and bolts of the story stay the same. Hari is behind the times. Hari doesn\u2019t understand this new generation. Is Hari about to push his daughters one step too far? Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, to 6 July MG Three of the best ... dance shows Birmingham Royal Ballet: [Un]leashed The ballet world has stepped up in the last decade, as the outcry about its lack of female choreographers has gathered momentum. Here, Birmingham Royal Ballet does its bit for gender balance with a triple bill that includes homegrown talent Ruth Brill, alongside Didy Veldman and Jessica Lang. Birmingham Hippodrome, Wednesday 12 to 15; Sadler\u2019s Wells, EC1 25 &amp; 26 June No Woman\u2019s Land Spanish choreographer Avat\u00e2ra Ayuso creates an unusual duet, performing with Inuk elder Naulaq LeDrew. The pair explore stories of their lives, homelands \u2013 the sunny Mediterranean and the frozen Canadian Arctic \u2013 and their experiences of migration. Part of Border Crossings\u2019 Origins festival. The Place, WC1, Friday 14 to 15 June Margot Fonteyn: A Celebration Britain\u2019s most adored ballerina, the artist formerly known as Peggy Hookham, would have celebrated her 100th birthday last month. The Royal Ballet pays tribute to its prima ballerina assoluta with extracts from some of the roles Fonteyn made famous.
