Bennett has repeatedly come under fire for the way he works with the media since arriving to take charge of England, with the situation escalating further last Saturday when he was labelled a \u201cdisgrace\u201d by the former Salford and Wales coach, Iestyn Harris, for his post-match interview with the BBC following England\u2019s victory against Scotland. But the 66-year-old insisted the best way to promote rugby league in this country is by winning, not by being media savvy. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you about promoting rugby league,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can talk to any marketing department and they don\u2019t want you to be goofing off and talking it up when your team\u2019s getting beat every week. My players and my teams are my priority and always will be. I\u2019m not interested in talk; talk is cheap and I\u2019m not interested in thinking I can promote the game by something I say. I started coaching in 1977 and they were bagging me then, and nothing\u2019s changed in 2016.\u201d Most of the focus leading into the game at the London Stadium has been on Bennett and Mal Meninga, after the Kangaroos coach said Bennett attempted to undermine his position and that he wanted Meninga\u2019s job before accepting the offer from the RFL at the start of this year. Bennett attempted to defuse the situation on Wednesday and put the spotlight back on his players. \u201cI haven\u2019t read anything so it doesn\u2019t worry me,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw him yesterday and spent some time with him. I didn\u2019t undermine him but if that\u2019s what he believes, that\u2019s his prerogative.\u201d England have not beaten Australia for more than 20 years and Bennett remained coy when asked whether his players possess the belief to get one over the world champions. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but we\u2019re going to find out. There\u2019s lots of fallacies in what we do and that\u2019s a fallacy \u2013 how do you tell if someone has self-belief? They could talk tough and look tough but not play tough.\u201d Bennett also confirmed the vice-captain, James Graham, will be fit having missed the game against Scotland with a knee problem. \u201cHe\u2019ll be playing,\u201d he said. \u201cHe trained this morning and he\u2019s good. It\u2019s important to have him back: he brings a lot.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
