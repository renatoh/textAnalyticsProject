In an unusually strong endorsement for the deal that contrasted with the block put on Lloyds TSB's hostile bid for Abbey National, the trade and industry secretary, Patricia Hewitt, said: \"The merger will not raise competition concerns in the banking sector that would warrant a reference to the competition commission. Unlike the proposed Lloyds TSB-Abbey National merger, this does not involve one of the big four banks and the removal of a competitor. In fact, it may strengthen competitive pressures on the big four.\" The head office for the combined bank, named HBOS, will be at the Bank of Scotland building in Edinburgh, but separate brands will remain on the high street. About 2,000 job cuts are planned from a staff of 60,000 to save \u00a3305m a year in costs. These are expected to be achieved through natural wastage. The block on the Lloyds TSB-Abbey bid has shifted City takeover speculation to the middle-sized mortgage banks, such as Northern Rock and Alliance &amp; Leicester. But yesterday Northern Rock, which posted record six-month profits of \u00a3139.6m, moved to deflate expectations of a bid when its takeover protection expires next year. Shares in Northern Rock have nearly doubled in recent months from a low of 325p to a peak of 609p. But yesterday the bank insisted that it has received no bid approaches and is adamant that it can maintain its independence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
