The Arsenal manager knows that his club will need a favour from either Middlesbrough, who visit Liverpool on Sunday\u2013 the final day of the Premier League season \u2013 or Watford, who host Manchester City. But, as he demanded that those teams put in the same effort as Sunderland did here, he retained hope. Arsenal return to the Emirates Stadium on Sunday to face Everton. They sit one point behind fourth-placed Liverpool and three behind City, who are third. \u201cI don\u2019t think about the percentages,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cI just think: \u2018Let\u2019s make sure we win against Everton.\u2019 Even if you have only a 1% chance, you would have to play totally at 100% but I think we have a good chance. If we won, it would be the first time you make 75 points and you are not in the top four. \u201cI answer for 20 years the question: \u2018Is the top four nothing special?\u2019 I don\u2019t know why, suddenly, it could become such a big problem [not to finish in the top four]. I am quite surprised. I want to make sure, absolutely, that we are in there but let\u2019s get to 75 points and see what happens. You want all the teams to fight like Sunderland did tonight and, after, you have to accept the result.\u201d S\u00e1nchez scored both of the goals towards the end of the game, having shaken off the thigh problem that had threatened his participation. \u201cI made the decision to start him at 4pm,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cI felt he had something still left. Once he is on the pitch and has the ball, he becomes the devil and forgets his pain.\u201d Wenger claimed not to have noticed the massive number of empty seats inside the stadium or to care about them. It had felt like the latest protest against him and his desire to continue into next season. \u201cIt\u2019s a Tuesday night against Sunderland, who everyone expects us to beat,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWhen you play football, you do not count how many people are sitting in the stand. We do our job and we have done that tonight. Will it be full against Everton? We are sold out.\u201d The Sunderland manager, David Moyes, took issue with Wenger\u2019s pre-match comments about how teams with nothing left to play for were sometimes \u201con holiday.\u201d Moyes said: \u201cThat\u2019s an insult to footballers. When you are brought up in this country, you are brought up to show that every game matters.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
