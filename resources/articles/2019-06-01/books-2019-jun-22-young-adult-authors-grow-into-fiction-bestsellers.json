Collins, who had begun her career in young adult fiction, was between contracts. She wrote her first adult novel because it was \u201cthe book I wanted to read\u201d. It has already sold more than 35,000 hardback copies \u2013 and 100,000 when eBooks are included \u2013 making it the biggest-selling fiction hardback of the year so far, an achievement driven largely by the support of booksellers and word-of-mouth recommendations. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about whether a teenager or an adult would read it or what market I was writing it for,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I also really wanted the story to be immersive, almost overwhelming and escapist in the way that the best young adult fiction is while at the same time hopefully doing interesting literary things.\u201d Collins is not alone in thinking this way. While there has always been movement between YA and adult fiction with bestsellers such as Angie Thomas read by both adults and teens, writers from Sarra Manning to Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older carving out successful careers in both genres and everyone from Carl Hiaasen to Nick Hornby giving YA a whirl, the boundaries between the two markets are collapsing and a number of big-hitting YA writers will bring out their first adult novels this year. \u201cI think there\u2019s always been a blurring of YA and adult fiction but people weren\u2019t as aware of it,\u201d says Irish author Louise O\u2019Neill, whose first two novels, Only Ever Yours and Asking For It, were sold in both YA and adult fiction. \u201cBooks like The Outsiders, Catcher in the Rye or Curtis Sittenfeld\u2019s Prep could just as easily be placed on the YA shelves in bookshops today. When I was writing Only Ever Yours I didn\u2019t set out to write a book for young adults. I just told the story the way that I felt it needed to be told \u2013 that did cause some difficulties because many publishers struggled to see how they would market it. Was it YA? Was it adult fiction?\u201d That blurring is particularly pronounced where fantasy is concerned, says Rachel Winterbottom, senior editor at Gollancz who this year will bring out YA juggernaut Leigh Bardugo\u2019s first adult novel Ninth House. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a move going on which you can see with Leigh, Victoria Schwab \u2013 who is Victoria for the YA books and VE Schwab for the adult ones \u2013 and also Sarah J Maas, who is writing her first adult fantasy series,\u201d she says. \u201cPart of it is that the adult genre does allow them to go a bit darker and explore other themes. YA itself does cover a lot of dark themes but branding it as an adult book is a way of announcing very early to the audience that this is something different. I think also it allows writers to keep their readership even as they perhaps age out of young adult books. With Leigh\u2019s book, even though it\u2019s very different from her YA fantasy because it\u2019s set in our world, albeit with supernatural elements, it\u2019s still recognisably her voice and her addictive way of telling a story. That\u2019s a big part of the appeal.\u201d And, while some of this change is driven by market forces \u2013 YA fiction recently suffered its lowest sales in over a decade \u2013 many authors find their focus and interests shifting over time. \u201cWith my last couple of YA books, Hidden Among Us and The Hidden Princess, I realised that my focus was increasingly with the older characters,\u201d says the Carnegie-medal nominated Katy Moran., whose new novel Wicked By Design is the second in a series of adult historical fantasies set in a world where Napoleon won the battle of Waterloo. \u201cI also think that while there\u2019s no theme you can\u2019t cover in YA or children\u2019s fiction you do have a responsibility to your reader when writing for teenagers which you don\u2019t have when writing for adults. So for example in False Lights [her first adult novel] Crow, the book\u2019s hero, would have had to be the villain because of how he behaves towards his younger brother Kitto. That\u2019s not to say that you can\u2019t be complex or nuanced when writing for teens because the very best YA is exactly that, more that you just need to keep your audience in mind.\u201d There are signs that that YA audience, which is largely progressive, outward looking and interested in issues of representation, may have a long-lasting impact on adult fiction. \u201cI\u2019m always struck when I do school visits by how progressive the students are,\u201d says O\u2019Neill. \u201cThey\u2019re incredibly eloquent, able to articulate issues of race, gender and sexuality in a clear and concise way and they expect the books they read to match their progressive outlook. YA authors are expected to be well-versed in these issues, which is not a bad thing despite what some would have you believe and I\u2019m interested to see if that will begin to seep into adult fiction because I\u2019d love to see authors for any age category feel encouraged to take risks with their work.\u201d For Collins, whose next book due out in 2020 follows a group of students in an alternate Europe in the 1930s, that shift is already occurring. \u201cI definitely think that The Binding would never have been published ten years ago,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a snobbery about what constituted serious fiction and what kind of story we had to be telling. The success of the YA market over the past decade has challenged those expectations and The Binding definitely benefited from that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
