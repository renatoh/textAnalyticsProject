Aswan", "bodyText": "Why? One of the reasons I travel is to relax, and Aswan seems like the most mellow of places, partly because the heat slows the tempo down. The best thing? The light at dusk: in Aswan it is remarkable because of the red desert sandstone that lines the banks of the Nile. The whole place takes on a pink hue which is both beautiful and calming. My ideal day: The key thing would be to not do that much! So the day would start very early because of the heat, with a breakfast overlooking the Nile, followed by a felucca ride to get a sense of life on the water. I'd read a book under the shade of a palm tree - a Russian novel set somewhere really cold would be ideal. After lunch, I'd have a sleep and be up again in time for sunset and tea on the terrace of the Old Cataract Hotel. My advice: Cover yourself up well and do not stray into parts of the town where you will be badgered by locals and sold stuff you don't need. Getting there: Cheapflights (cheapflights.co.uk) has return flights between Manchester and Aswan from \u00a3547pp. Where was your best holiday? A week in Venice one February, for my honeymoon. What is the best hotel you have ever stayed in? Hotel Greulich, Zurich. It's modern, plain and simple - it has everything you could need but no frills. Where do you want to go next? Somewhere that is good for children since I've just become a dad. I'd want a hotel where a young child can't injure himself and there are people who can help look after him - but I haven't a clue where this could be! What do you never travel without? Notebooks and pens. I find travelling a good spur to thought. Alain de Botton's book Status Anxiety (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a38.99) is published in paperback on January 13.
