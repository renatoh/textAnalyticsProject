Radcliffe\u2019s time of 2hr 15min 25sec, set with the aid of male pacemakers, has stood unchallenged since 2003. But having run 2:17:01 in a women\u2019s-only race last year \u2013 the second fastest time ever \u2013 Keitany believes that having male pacemakers this time will enable her to chase down Radcliffe\u2019s record. Dibaba is also said to be in fantastic form, leaving Radcliffe wondering whether her longstanding record might finally go. \u201cThe way Mary ran last year I thought for a long time it was under threat,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I think she is capable. But first and foremost she needs to concentrate on winning, because Tirunesh is highly capable too. But the record is very much down to how things are like on the day. You need good conditions, to have done the training and a bit of luck.\u201d Radcliffe admitted that a part of her would be \u201csad\u201d if it was finally to go. \u201cThe longer it has gone on, the more I have become attached to it,\u201d she added. \u201cIt has almost become part of the family. Did I think it would stand this long? Probably not. Do I want it to be beaten? No, but I can\u2019t do anything about it. I can\u2019t go out and reclaim it now.\u201d She also predicted a race for the ages \u2013 with Keitany establishing an early lead and Dibaba trying to reel her in. \u201cMary is going to go out and take the race by the scruff of the neck, while Tirunesh is far more likely to hold back until the second half of the race and see what she can do. Maybe that is the smarter tactic.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
