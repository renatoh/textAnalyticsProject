There, he ran into the retired Bill Shankly, who growled: \"So you're down to have a look at our great team?\" Aberdeen lost 1-0 and 4-0 to Paisley's reds in the ensuing European Cup tie and Ferguson learned a lesson in power. Almost two decades later, the Manchester United ruler speeds west knowing that a victory today could erase Liverpool's hopes of staying level with United on 18 league titles. Chelsea, Arsenal and perhaps Manchester City would still stand between Ferguson's men and win number 19, but a fifth Premier League defeat for Liverpool would complete a quintet of consecutive losses for Rafa Ben\u00edtez and light a fire under his five-year reign. For once hyperbole is absent from the declaration that today's derby could be an epochal contest. It could sour the love between Ben\u00edtez and the Kop, hasten the team's descent towards the Europa League and spark a full rebellion against the Stadler and Waldorf pair who borrowed to buy a community treasure without understanding its role as extended family. Xabi Alonso, sold to Real Madrid, said this month of his time on Merseyside: \"They are a special institution. I jumped into the pool of their history and philosophy.\" The insurrection starts here, with as many as 10,000 expected to join a protest march to demand that Tom Hicks and George Gillett leave town by sundown. Stanley Park, the site of the proposed new stadium, remains undisturbed by diggers. As Ben\u00edtez prepares for his 200th Premier League test, and Liverpool risk falling 10 points behind after 10 league matches, Koppites wonder whether Jos\u00e9 Mourinho might fancy the role of Portuguese Shankly should he ever tire of Serie A. Deep experience of derby day unpredictability will tell United that Liverpool are never more dangerous than when swamped by adversity (ask Milan, 3-0 half-time leaders in the 2005 Champions League final). But today's hosts have lost to Fiorentina, Sunderland, Chelsea and Lyon in 22 hellish days \u2013 their worst sequence since April 1987. Their Champions League ambitions dangle in the wind and five league defeats before Bonfire Night would render it unthinkable that they can end a 20-year wait to reclaim the domestic summit. In a rotten October, even their own beach balls are against them. Anfield is a place of fragile peace between the owners and the owned, between performers and profiteers. Last season's rousing league campaign (86 points, second place, two defeats and the double over Chelsea and United) encouraged the Kop's belief that good management and the brilliance of Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres would outweigh the instability brought by feuding owners. Against that backdrop, injuries to Torres and Gerrard and the mediocrity of many of Ben\u00edtez's lesser signings have set loose a maelstrom. After the Lyon game on Tuesday, anger seeped from the stands. The prime targets were the bit-part players the fans accuse of dragging down the stars. Andriy Voronin, Lucas Leiva, David Ngog and Emiliano Ins\u00faa were among those dismissed as impostors. \"I can't change the minds of a lot of people but 100% I can say that the 86 points we got last year were not because we are a bad team or a bad squad,\" Ben\u00edtez says. \"It's because we have something that is right. In three months we can talk and I'm sure you won't ask me this because we'll be really high in the table.\" Ben\u00edtez is the most enigmatic of the top Premier League bosses. As Alonso says: \"His style is what has made him what he is. I suppose every now and again a player would appreciate more closeness, a pat on the back, but Rafa is not that kind of guy.\" Much of the fire is directed at his record in the transfer market, and his habit of turning cold on acquisitions who disappoint him, such as Robbie Keane and Ryan Babel. Last week he rejected the charge that he has packed Anfield with nowhere men, saying: \"I have seen a lot of names in the press and I didn't even know the player. They are counting all the players of the under-eights, under-nines, under-10s, under-11s, who we have signed. \"If you talk about the players and spend some time with this, with players worth more than \u00a37m we have 80% success, and below this figure we have to take some gambles. When you don't have too much money you have to take some gambles and some players were really good. If you sign a player and he's not doing well and you sell him you bring money in, big money in. \"You were asking me about Keane. He was a very good signing and everyone was saying he was a fantastic signing. For different reasons he didn't play at the level we know he can play. Because he's a good player, we brought in a massive amount of money. If we make a mistake, we try to find solutions as quickly as possible because we can't sign four wingers and spend \u00a315m on each winger and still they don't play. Other teams can do this, but we can't.\" Spain is where Ben\u00edtez built his reputation as a giant-slayer, toppling the Real Madrid of Zidane, Figo, Beckham and Ronaldo to bring Valencia their first La Liga title for 31 years, and then another, with strong defending and a swift counterattack. These are serious credentials. At Liverpool he has reached two Champions League finals, winning one, and won an FA Cup, while finishing fifth, third, third, fourth and second in the Premier League. \"I still have a lot of confidence,\" he says. \"If you lose your confidence, you cannot keep your players working and believing. The main thing for a manager is to have strong ideas and keep working.\" To dismiss Ben\u00edtez would cost the Anfield board a theoretical \u00a320m: the price of paying-up his new five-year contract. And though occasional brutality is within the club's capabilities (G\u00e9rard Houllier's league sequence, when he was sacked in 2004, was third, second, fifth and fourth), the supporters would be unlikely to support such bloodletting, given that it would originate with Hicks and Gillett, and so find themselves snared between growing scepticism towards the manager and a loathing of the owners. Ben\u00edtez, meanwhile, emerged from his melancholia on Tuesday to enter self-defensive mode. Alonso's replacement, the Italian Alberto Aquilani, has missed the first two months of the season, and Ben\u00edtez says: \"To replace a player like Alonso, a player with quality, with another player of quality, we needed to do it in this way. The price and the quality of the player were right. The problem we've had is that Gerrard was injured, Mascherano [was linked] in the pre-season with Barcelona, and then had to play with Argentina trying to qualify for the World Cup. Then we couldn't manage too well because we had many problems all together.\" At the other end of the M62, Ferguson sees his chance to avenge last season's 4-1 home defeat: \"That is not the sort of scoreline you can forget about easily, but it is in the past now. The important thing is that we didn't let it affect us. We recovered from it and went on to win the title.\" With Wayne Rooney a doubt through injury, Ferguson says: \"I've been pleased with [Dimitar] Berbatov's form this season, he's responded well to playing all the time. He reminds me of Eric Cantona, the way he takes his time when other players would hurry. And like Eric, although he can do the flicks and first time passes very well, he knows when a short, simple pass is the best option. I always used to say Eric was the best ever passer of the simple pass. \"The other player I have been impressed with in the last few weeks is Antonio Valencia. He scored in Russia [against CSKA] and his confidence is improving all the time. I think that's important, because he is quite a shy boy who perhaps needed a while to settle in. He's done very well, and there's no reason why he cannot do even better in the years to come because he has a lot of assets. He's powerful, brave, quick and has good balance.\" Given their recent feuds, Ben\u00edtez can expect even less empathy than usual from his great north-west foe. \"I visited United training before I took over at Tenerife,\" he says. \"In my first games with Liverpool v United we had some chats, talking about football. Everything was OK, no problem. Now I think something is different.\" A glass of post-match wine, perhaps? \"I think we have some wine. I don't know if it's from Rioja or from Castilla. I don't know, but we have some good wine, yeah.\" Which is not the same as saying he will drink some with his nemesis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
