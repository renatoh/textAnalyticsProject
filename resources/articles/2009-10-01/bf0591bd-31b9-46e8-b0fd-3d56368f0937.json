In 1928, when the Fifa congress in Amsterdam announced its plans to host a World Cup tournament in Uruguay, the FA member Charles Sutcliffe gave them the shortest of shrift: \"I don't care a brass farthing about the improvement of the game in France, Belgium, Austria or Germany. The Fifa does not appeal to me. An organisation where such football associations as those of Uruguay and Paraguay, Brazil and Egypt, Bohemia and Pan Russia are co-equal with England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland seems to me to be a case of magnifying the midgets.\" Anti-Europe, Fifa-phobic and believing that pretty much anyone who is not indigenous to these islands is a midget \u2013 these are the kind of views that one thankfully only hears these days on Question Time. Similarly blinkered thinking was on display at the creation of the European Cup. In 1954, Wolves beat Honved 3-2 in a televised friendly and manager Stan Cullis promptly announced that this result, obviously, made them \"champions of the world\". The French disagreed and, to prove their point, set up the European Cup. Chelsea, as English champions, were invited to take part, but declined having consulted Alan Hardaker, a man who explained to Brian Glanville that he didn't like dealing with football in Europe on account of there being \"too many wogs and dagoes\". And, of course, magnified midgets. It might, therefore, be considered a step forward that Somerset and Sussex showed up for the Twenty20 Champions League. And, if either of them had progressed to the final, the latter stages of a tournament that, in conception, is half Indian, a third Australian and a sixth South African might have received coverage. But, no, the parochialism continues \u2013 and, in the process, a heart-warming story has slid by. At the start, Trinidad &amp; Tobago were among the outsiders. But they played outstandingly, being the only unbeaten team going into the final. The spin bowler of the tournament was Dave Mohammed. The Bravo brothers were top of the bill. The hitting and fielding of Kieron Pollard was astonishing (his non-catch, when he kept the ball in play with a hammer-thrower's spin and, then, launched a long-distance belly flop to nearly catch it, was astounding). And in charge of the controlled mayhem was the cool and urbane Daren Ganga. On Friday evening, they faced arch Aussies New South Wales. It was, as Sunil Gavaskar is fond of saying, one side's Gods against the other side's Gods. And, for a good while, it seemed as if the Caribbean Gods would prevail over their Australian counterparts, as NSW struggled to 83 for six. But, not for the first time, the Gods had overlooked Brett Lee. He chipped in with a five-six 48 and two for 10, and that was pretty much that. On the upside, the T&amp;T team received a prize equivalent to a dollar for every inhabitant of the island and, for many, their scintillating performances make them the stars of the first global club-cricket format, a mix of World Cup and Champions League that football has yet to invent. It was innovative and it will be huge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
