Last week, Abbey's shareholders approved the takeover of Abbey by Santander, despite criticism from small investors, who accused chairman Lord Burns of selling the former lender on the cheap. Burns is expected to be invited on to Santander's main board after the deal is completed in November. MIT-educated Powers-Freeling, 46, joined M&amp;S in November 2001 from Lloyds TSB, where she was a managing director. Highly regarded in the City, she would be viewed as 'quite a catch for Santander', according to a leading banking analyst. She began her career with management consultancy McKinsey &amp; Co before moving to Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank,then on to UK insurer Prudential, where she was head of strategy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
