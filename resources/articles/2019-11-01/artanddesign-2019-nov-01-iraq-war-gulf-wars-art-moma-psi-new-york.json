It\u2019s great for a selfie op, but there\u2019s a deeper meaning to the artwork, created in 2002 by Thomas Hirschhorn. CNN played a pivotal role in accelerating the 24-hour news coverage of the Gulf war, setting the pace for war news. This artwork is being shown as part of Theater of Operations: the Gulf Wars, 1991\u20132011, featuring over 250 artworks by 75 artists. It details the tragic, gruesome effects of war, as told by western and Middle Eastern artists. \u201cWe realized there hasn\u2019t been a major survey of Iraqi art in the US,\u201d said Peter Eleey, who co-curated the exhibition with Ruba Katrib. \u201cEveryone wants to talk about the current conflict, but this conflict has been going on for 30 years. We\u2019re looking at what an artist on one side of an issue makes, versus another, sometimes on the same event.\u201d With the recent killing of the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and with US troops leaving northern Syria and being deployed in eastern Syria, America\u2019s military presence is as topical as ever. But for the artists who lived in Kuwait and Iraq in the 1990s, what was it like to live through such horror? \u201cIt\u2019s timely but also belated, because this has not been addressed culturally,\u201d said Katrib. \u201cIraqi art has not been addressed; Iraqi cultural production hasn\u2019t been addressed either. But the US has been entangled in Iraq for three decades, so why has there been such a lack of representation, interest, or time and space given to Iraqi cultural production?\u201d Good question. While America is slowly warming up to Middle Eastern art and culture (a new not-for-profit in Washington dedicated to Middle Eastern art opened in September, while an exhibition of female Iranian artists is opening next week at the High Line Nine in New York), the 1991 Gulf war\u2019s devastating impact has yet to be fully explored within art \u2013 at least that which has been shared with a wider western audience. The exhibition moves chronologically throughout three floors, beginning with paintings by Khalifa Qattan, the first ever Kuwaiti artist to have a solo exhibition. On view are paintings from his Prophecy series, made between the 1960s and 1980s, which were premonitions of war. One self-portrait from 1984 shows the artist behind bars, a metaphor for the occupation of Kuwait. \u201cOnce Iraq invaded Kuwait, he redefined his older work and claimed they were prophecies of the coming invasion,\u201d said Katrib. Some artists in the exhibition were exiled, while some created their work from studios in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s about the proximity artists have to conflict,\u201d said Eleey. \u201cNot all the artists are making art from inside of Iraq during the war. One of the key things that art does is that it\u2019s testimony to personal experience, the life of a single person. Throughout the show, we\u2019ve tried to give examples of that.\u201d The Kuwaiti artist Thuraya Al-Baqsami is showing a print that reads \u2018No to the Invasion\u2019 in Arabic from 1990. It was distributed ahead of the American intervention, but after activists were arrested \u2013 and two were executed \u2013 Al-Baqsami stopped making the poster. Also on view is Iraqi-British artist Dia al-Azzawi\u2019s 1991 painting Victim\u2019s Portrait, which is based on the face of a dead Iraqi soldier who was burned alive by US airstrikes, while retreating from Kuwait. A photo of the soldier was taken by the American photojournalist Kenneth Jarecke and while American news outlets refused to publish the gruesome image, it was published in the Observer under the headline: \u201cThe Real Face Of War.\u201d \u201cIt was a problematic PR moment for the US, because people were shocked the military would strike when soldiers were on retreat, counter to the image of the US at the time,\u201d said Katrib. On the same note, Michel Auder\u2019s Gulf War TV War from 1991 was re-edited in 2017, combining news clips with entertainment. \u201cThis work is looking back in the era of fake news,\u201d said Eleey. \u201cIt\u2019s not just news coverage, its commercials and other TV shows, how it fit into a larger cultural moment in 1991.\u201d Richard Serra\u2019s Stop Bush drawing from 2004 details some of the chilling human rights violations against prisoners in Abu Ghraib in Iraq. And Judith Joy Ross\u2019s photos from Gulf war rallies in Pennsylvania in 1990 were taken at a farewell dinner for troops in Allentown. \u201cPeople forget this war was celebratory, [that] people were excited about it,\u201d said Katrib. \u201cMilitary technology promised a clean-cut, video game-like war. It was going to be a new model for war; get a smart bomb, search out your target and you\u2019re done, but that\u2019s not what happened.\u201d Martha Rosler\u2019s collages from the early 2000s detail battle photos alongside upscale interior design magazine cutouts, creating a chilling comparison between the east and west. \u201cThere was a way to criticize a larger system of American militarization,\u201d said Eleey. Unforgettable, too, are the Guerrilla Girls\u2019 advertisement for their Estrogen Bomb, where they write: \u201cSend estrogen pills to presidents, prime ministers, generals, oligarchs and CEOs everywhere,\u201d adding that \u201cthe world needs a new weapon.\u201d The exhibition features the voices of Arab artists, such as Iraqi writer and artist Nuha al-Radi, author of a book called Baghdad Diaries, which chronicles her experience living through the first Gulf war, who wrote: \u201cThe west seems to have only three images of Arabs \u2013 terrorists, oil sheiks and women covered in black from head to toe. I\u2019m not sure they know if there are ordinary human beings who live here.\u201d A series from al-Radi\u2019s scrap wood and metal sculptures from her Embargo Series are also on view. The figures are shown alongside an excerpt from a diary entry she wrote in 2003. She was disappointed Iraqi Cultural Week was canceled with the impending US invasion of Iraq. Everyone fled. \u201cSo only the art remains,\u201d al-Radi wrote. Referring to her wooden sculptures, she added: \u201cThey look as if they are demonstrating, they represent the Iraqi people and I am calling them \u2018We the people.\u2019\u201d There is a room devoted to Jamal Penjweny\u2019s 2010 photo series Saddam is Here, where Iraqi people cover their faces with an image of Saddam Hussein. \u201cHe traveled across Iraq finding strangers to put this paper face of Saddam over their face,\u201d said Katrib. \u201cIt was made after Saddam was killed, as the artist felt subsequent leaders were replicating the same policies.\u201d Also on show are illustrations by the Guardian writer Ghaith Abdul-Ahad, who made drawings of Iraqi men detained in south Baghdad during a US army raid in the early 2000s. There\u2019s also a mural by Dia al-Azzawi called Mission of Destruction, which was painted in response to the American invasion, which draws a parallel to Pablo Picasso\u2019s Guernica. \u201cWe knew it would be timely. It has been 30 years since various conflicts have centered around Iraq, in one way or another, but they\u2019re mostly western perspectives on the conflict,\u201d said Eleey. Katrib added: \u201cThere are different perspective in this show. There isn\u2019t just one here.\u201d Theater of Operations: The Gulf Wars, 1991\u20132011 is showing at MoMA PS1 in Queens from 3 November until March 2020"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
