Goals from Dario Srna, Oleksandr Gladkiy and Alex Teixeira gave Shakhtar a 3-0 aggregate victory. The Turkish side were missing Van Persie but Nani, their other summer signing from Manchester United, was left frustrated on a night characterised by impressive comebacks across Europe. Partizan Belgrade, Astana, Malmo and CSKA Moscow reached the play-off round of the Champions League qualifiers after looking likely to go out. CSKA hit back from two goals behind at Sparta Prague to win 3-2 and qualify 5-4 on aggregate against the demoralised Czechs, who had only needed a goalless draw to progress. The Russian international Alan Dzagoev scored the winner in the 76th minute after two goals from Ahmed Musa had hauled the Russians back into the match. Astana, having drawn 0-0 in the first leg away to HJK Helsinki, also fell two goals behind at home but hit back to lead 3-2 before Patrick Twumasi, one of their goalscorers, was sent off in the 70th minute. Erfan Zeneli converted an 86th-minute penalty to level at 3-3 and put the Finns ahead on away goals, only for Evgeniy Postnikov to score a stoppage-time winner for the Kazakh champions. The Serbian champions Partizan went through after a roller-coaster 4-2 home win over 10-man Steaua Bucharest gave them a 5-3 aggregate win against the 1986 European Cup winners. Trailing 2-1 at half-time, Partizan missed a penalty when Valeri Bojinov hit the post. But Steaua fell apart after their captain Fernando Varela was sent off and Partizan hit back with three goals in the final half-hour through Marko Jevtovic, Andrija Zivkovic and the substitute Nikola Trujic. Malmo needed only 14 minutes to cancel out a two-goal first-leg deficit at home to Red Bull Salzburg as goals from Nikola Djurdjic and Markus Rosenberg had the Austrians reeling. Although the visitors took control, Vladimir Rodic pounced on a defensive blunder to score the third three minutes before halftime to give the Swedish champions a 3-0 win which sent them through 3-2 on aggregate. It was the eighth time in a row that Salzburg have gone out in the qualifying rounds since Red Bull took over the club in 2005. Skenderbeu also qualified, putting themselves within two matches of becoming the first Albanian side to reach the group stage, after beating Milsami in another of the third round, second-leg ties. Skenderbeu\u2019s 2-0 win over the Moldovan champions gave them a 4-0 aggregate win."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
