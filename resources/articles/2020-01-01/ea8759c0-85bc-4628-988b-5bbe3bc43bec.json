The prime minister spoke to the US president, Donald Trump, on Sunday after the US drone strike on Iran\u2019s top military leader on Friday. Johnson said he would be speaking to Iraq \u201cto support peace and stability\u201d after its parliament called for the expulsion of foreign troops, including British soldiers working against Islamic State (Isis). \u201cGeneral Qassem Suleimani posed a threat to all our interests and was responsible for a pattern of disruptive, destabilising behaviour in the region,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cGiven the leading role he has played in actions that have led to the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians and western personnel, we will not lament his death. \u201cIt is clear however that all calls for retaliation or reprisals will simply lead to more violence in the region and they are in no one\u2019s interest.\u201d Johnson, who was facing criticism for his silence while on holiday in the Caribbean during the escalating crisis, also said he had spoken to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Downing Street said the PM arrived back in the UK on Sunday, but did not immediately say whether he was in No 10. Ministers are due to meet on Monday to discuss the crisis, which has raised fears of war, and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, will update parliament on Tuesday. Earlier on Sunday, Raab said Britain was \u201con the same page\u201d as the US in relation to Suleimani\u2019s death. Speaking on Sky News amid continuing questions about the legal justification for US actions, Raab said of Suleimani: \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear: he was a regional menace, and we understand the position that the Americans found themselves in, and they have a right to exercise self-defence. They have explained the basis on which that was done, and we are sympathetic to the situation they found themselves in.\u201d The foreign secretary said he had spoken to the Iraqi president and prime minister as well as his French and German counterparts since the assassination, and Britain\u2019s focus had been on restoring calm, and protecting its troops and citizens in the region. \u201cWe are looking to de-escalate and stabilise the situation and that is something we have talked about with our European and our American friends,\u201d he said. But asked whether he would be taking a \u201ctough message\u201d to the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and Trump, Raab said: \u201cWe\u2019re on the same page with our American partners; we\u2019ll continue to talk to them.\u201d Raab also defended the prime minister\u2019s decision not to curtail his holiday on Mustique when news of Suleimani\u2019s death emerged, saying Johnson had been in charge throughout. Raab\u2019s stance was criticised by the shadow foreign secretary and Labour leadership contender, Emily Thornberry. She said Washington\u2019s decision to kill Suleimani in a drone strike in Iraq risked sparking a war in the Middle East \u2013 and the government should make clear that it would play no part in such a conflict. \u201cI don\u2019t shed any tears for Suleimani; I fully understand his pattern of behaviour. He was essentially in charge of the defence forces for Iran. Their behaviour across the region has been destabilising. He has the blood of many people on his hands,\u201d she said, speaking on Sky News. \u201cHowever, to \u2018take him out\u2019, at this stage, when there has been escalating tensions, seems to me to not be making the world safer; actually, we are taking a lurch towards war.\u201d The former Labour foreign secretary Jack Straw said he had \u201creal concern\u201d about the implications of the killing of Suleimani. Speaking to BBC News on Sunday, Straw said: \u201cEven if you accept, which I don\u2019t, President Trump\u2019s assertions that Qassem Suleimani was, quote, \u2018the world\u2019s worst terrorist leader\u2019, this was not a sensible action to take and it will have really serious implications for the west, for America and for the region as a whole.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
