Alongside the screamed vocals of George Clarke and double bass drumming of Daniel Tracy, came swatches of post-rock and shoegaze\u2019s atmospheric chords from songwriter/guitarist Kerry McCoy. New Bermuda sees them follow that up by pushing things even further. Brought to the Water starts with industrial drones and church bells, Luna mixes thrash with cinematic breakdowns and Gifts for the Earth is more motorik than metal. That hybrid quality is what makes the band anathema to some metal fans \u2013 a position that hasn\u2019t been helped by claims guitarist Kerry McCoy used homophobic language on Twitter \u2013 but this is a band moving beyond one simple characterisation. While claims they\u2019ve got a \u201cpop-like accessibility\u201d feel overstated, those who like the loud bits of Mogwai and the more melodic moments of Dillinger Escape Plan will have found the metal band for them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
