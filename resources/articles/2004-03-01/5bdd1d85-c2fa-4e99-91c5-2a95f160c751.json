The 30-year-old Italian, who has been outstanding in goal for Roman Abramovich's club this season, badly bruised a finger and cracked a bone in his hand during a training session. Chelsea's website said Cudicini was definitely out of Saturday's trip to Bolton Wanderers but was hopeful of resuming training once the bruising went down. Cudicini kept a clean sheet in Chelsea's 0-0 home draw with German side VfB Stuttgart on Tuesday to help secure his team a place in the Champions League quarter-finals. It remains to be seen how long Cudicini will be ruled out for and any absence could prove to be a major problem for boss Claudio Ranieri. After all, while Ranieri has strengthened his goalkeeping options by signing Petr Cech, the Czech international does not arrive until this summer. In the meantime, he would be likely to turn to former Spurs keeper Neil Sullivan, who has not looked exactly convincing in several of his displays this season. The 34-year-old former Scotland international has so far started four Premiership games, one FA Cup tie and two Carling Cup ties since arriving at Stamford Bridge on a free transfer last summer. However, he was found wanting during his last appearance against Arsenal last month - when Cudicini was out injured - as he flapped at a corner and Edu was allowed to convert the Gunners' winner. On a more positive note, Ranieri is at least hoping Juan Sebastian Veron, who has had an operation on a back injury, could return to action in a month's time. The Chelsea boss revealed: \"Seba is good. He could come back early next week and, in a month, he could be ready to play again. \"Everything has gone right so far, with him starting to swim, run and play a little with the ball. If everything continues in this way, he could be ready in a month.\" Ranieri is nevertheless without not only Veron and Emmanuel Petit for Saturday's game at Bolton, but also has an injury doubt over Glen Johnson due to a sprained ankle, while Eidur Gudjohnsen and Adrian Mutu are both suspended. That means Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is poised to start up front alongside Hernan Crespo and the Dutch striker has moved to deny reports that he is threatening to leave Chelsea this summer. Hasselbaink admitted during an interview with Dutch television earlier this week that he had been left frustrated by the rotation policy at Chelsea. However, the club's in-house TV station reported: \"Jimmy has asked us to tell you that he has not said he wants to leave Chelsea. He doesn't feel that way, he just wants to play.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
