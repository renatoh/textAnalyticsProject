The setter\u2019s name often links to an interview with him or her, in case you feel like getting to know these people better. The news in clues As usual, if you come to crosswords to escape what\u2019s in the rest of the paper, please scroll or swipe down to Latter Patter. That goes double this time, as Vlad \u2013 who we interviewed in August, so that\u2019s approximately 400 years ago \u2013 has produced a puzzle with clue after clue on a certain theme. Its pugnaciousness is hinted at by this one \u2026 5/9ac Current protection scheme in tatters \u2014 need extremely qualified expert (4,3,5) [ wordplay: anagram of (\u2018qualified\u2019) TATTERS &amp; first &amp; last letters of (\u2018extremely\u2019) NEED, then synonym for \u2018expert\u2019 ] [ anagram of TATTERSND, then ACE ] [ definition: current protection scheme ] \u2026 for TEST AND TRACE, and by the time the relevant non-expert makes her appearance, the puzzle becomes one for the history books. Meanwhile, Knut takes a what seems to be a Swiftian approach to another theme. This starts at one across \u2026 1ac Cameron, perhaps fated to spill daughter\u2019s secret (11) [ wordplay: what \u2018Cameron\u2019 is an example of + synonym for \u2018fated\u2019 without (\u2018to spill\u2019) abbrev. for \u2018daughter\u2019 ] [ CLAN + DESTINED \u2013 D ] [ definition: secret ] \u2026 though the theme is much more topical than the surface reading of the clue for CLANDESTINE might suggest. Puzzles elsewhere For the shorter days, let\u2019s have a fortnightly recommendation of something puzzle-related: Zoom / PDF / something else. Your thoughts are tremendously welcome. My first is a Thursday evening quiz from Frank Paul, author of The Cryptic Pub Quiz. It is ingenious, wide-ranging and very cryptic and will need all your attention and brainpower. Entry via Twitter DM in advance: Latter patter Here\u2019s a clue by Hectence from the quiptic, the Guardian\u2019s \u201ccryptic puzzle for beginners and those in a hurry\u201d. 1ac Fibre for rope mats is a leaf extract (5) [ wordplay: some of the letters of (\u2018extract\u2019) MATSISALEAF ] [ definition: fibre for rope ] The solver in a hurry is still required to take the time to break up the natural phrase \u201crope mats\u201d, taking the first word as the end of the definition and the second as the start of the wordplay, before getting some lovely SISAL. This is a word I first encountered on a Berkshire campsite in the mid 1980s. In fact, it was 15 April 1984, as I Want to Break Free had just been announced on a little radio as a new entry on the Top 40, which I mention only to convey how vividly I recall being baffled by the word. Or at least its spelling: sizal? syzol? I settled on \u201csisle\u201d; there was no time to ask, as the sisal in question needed to be put away. Had I asked, the answer might have been: \u201cWell, just the same as the Yucat\u00e1n port from which it is often exported\u201d, meaning that we can tie it to a Mexican town in a way that we completely failed to with JALOPY, which might or might not come from Xalapa, Veracruz \u2013 which does at least give us the jalape\u00f1o. Staying with food named after Mexican places, we have tequila (a town near Guadalajara) and of course Tabasco (a state in the south-east); staying with states, we have the word that regular entrants will have been suspecting might be the subject of our next challenge. Reader, how would you clue CHIHUAHUA? Cluing competition Many thanks for your clues for NINCOMPOOP. I enjoyed the surprisingly contemporary surfaces, most of all Lizard\u2019s pointed \u201cNo. 1 Con. performing with pomp?\u201d The audacity award has to go to Rakali for the preposterous \u2026 Divvy noun 1. income that is not declared 2. pinhead (10) \u2026 and the inside-baseball award goes to Albery\u2019s \u201cAbsorbed in clue-writin\u2019 in comp, oops \u2013 I\u2019m a bampot?\u201d The runners-up are Flatrod\u2019s smart \u201cNo recipe for popcorn?

Clue of the fortnight Nominated by reader Ousgg as \u201ctypically outrageous\u201d \u2026 6d Entertainer turning up at party, initially with tower of presents (3,6) [ wordplay: AT backwards (\u2018turning up\u2019) + first letter of (\u2018initially\u2019) PARTY + someone pulling Father Christmas\u2019s sleigh (\u2018tower of presents\u2019) ] [ TA + P + DANCER ] [ definition: entertainer ] \u2026 we can even forgive Tramp for reminding us of that festival in December. Stay safe. \u2022 My first puzzle collection, The Shipping Forecast Puzzle Book, is published on Thursday, can be ordered from the Guardian Bookshop, and is partially but not predominantly cryptic \u2022 Here is a collection of all our explainers, interviews and other helpful bits and bobs"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
