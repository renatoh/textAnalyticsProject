Labour\u2019s Ruth Smeeth called the decision \u201cdisgusting\u201d and said colleagues did not want Williamson in the party. \u201cI am horrified,\u201d she said on Wednesday. \u201cIt says a great deal about how seriously we\u2019re taking anti-Jewish hate.\u201d She added that she was \u201cnot comfortable being in the same room\u201d as the Derby North MP. The Guardian understands party investigators recommended the Derby North MP face a sterner sanction, but were overruled by a panel from the party\u2019s national executive committee, made up of the MPs Keith Vaz and George Howarth and constituency rep Huda Elmi. Sources close to the NEC said Vaz and Elmi had argued for Williamson\u2019s re-admission, with a formal warning, on the basis a snap general election was highly likely. Williamson is now likely to face a deselection battle in his constituency, but will be eligible to stand again for the party in any election. A Labour source said that a party panel, advised by an independent barrister, had found Williamson breached party rules and issued a formal sanction, though chose not to refer him to Labour\u2019s highest disciplinary body, the national constitutional committee, which considers possible expulsions. \u201cHe could face further, more severe, action if he repeats any similar comments or behaviour,\u201d a party source said. Labour MPs including Stella Creasy, Jess Phillips and Wes Streeting, all expressed disgust at the decision. Phillips said she was \u201cdisgusted but not surprised anymore\u201d and suggested she would have been expelled had she said similar things to Williamson. Creasy said it was \u201cthe best example yet of why we need an independent process for antisemitism and sexual harassment complaints. The Jewish Labour Movement also criticised the decision and said it showed the \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d the party was currently in. Chair Mike Katz said: \u201cHow dare the Labour party deny it is institutionally racist against Jews when it decides to take no action against Chris Williamson? \u201cIt seems the decision to let him off is because he represents a marginal seat and there might be a snap election. It\u2019s good to know that a party of anti-racists, led by an avowed anti-racist decides it\u2019s OK to ignore anti-Jewish racism if there\u2019s a vote to be won.\u201d A NEC source said it was a \u201cred herring\u201d to blame the decision on the party leadership. \u201cParty staff recommended that he be referred to the NCC, Keith Vaz who is a longtime operator on the Labour right opposed it,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe silver lining is that while suspended from the party Chris Williamson couldn\u2019t face a trigger ballot. Now he can be and I strongly hope he is deselected.\u201d In footage first revealed by the Yorkshire Post, Williamson was cheered by activists in Sheffield as he said: \u201cI\u2019ve got to say, I think our party\u2019s response has been partly responsible \u2026 Because, in my opinion, we\u2019ve backed off far too much, we\u2019ve given too much ground, we\u2019ve been too apologetic.\u201d The MP, who is a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, later issued an apology saying: \u201cI deeply regret, and apologise for, my recent choice of words when speaking about how the Labour party has responded to the ongoing fight against antisemitism inside of our party. I was trying to stress how much the party has done to tackle antisemitism.\u201d A party spokesman said: \u201cThe Labour party takes all complaints extremely seriously, which are investigated in line with our rules and procedures. We can\u2019t comment on individual cases.\u201d Williamson is likely to face a selection battle in his own constituency after a bitter row with the trade union Unite after he backed plans to reduce trade union influence in MP selections. He has vowed to fight any attempt to remove him as a candidate but said he welcomed open selection."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
