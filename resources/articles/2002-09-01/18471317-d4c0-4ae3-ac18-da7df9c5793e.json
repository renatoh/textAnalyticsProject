City break operators are cutting the cost of making an accommodation-only booking as they look to cater for the growing number of holidaymakers making independent travel arrangements. Traditionally city break operators have made their money from selling flights, hotels and transfers as part of a package, but the growth of no-frills airlines has meant more travellers want to put together their own itineraries and tour operators have had to adapt accordingly. Bridge City Breaks has halved its booking fee to \u00a37.50 per person for telephone bookings. Alternatively travellers can book hotels via its website, and not pay a booking fee. Sovereign Cities has made it cheaper for multiple bookings by cutting administration fees from \u00a320 per person to \u00a330 per booking, regardless of how many are in the party, from 8 October when its new brochure goes on sale. Cresta Holidays and Travelscene are considering reducing their administration fees. Both charge \u00a330 per booking. Cresta cities brand manager Ian Ackland claimed it wasn't always cheaper for holidaymakers to book direct with the hotel. 'Because we're such a big operator we have huge buying power with hotels. Travellers who book direct with the hotel also won't be able to take advantage of special offers such as Sunday night free deals.' Nick Bamford, marketing director of Travelscene, warned that holidaymakers would not be protected if they booked their flights and hotels separately. 'Accommodation only bookings are growing fast, but we think that selling a city break package still represents the best value for money and the best financial protection for customers.' Earlier this year Cresta launched its first accommodation-only brochure to capitalise on growing demand. This month Superbreak is more than doubling its existing programme featuring key European cities such as Paris and Rome from 340 to 800 hotels. It doesn't charge a booking fee. What is the best deal? So is it cheaper to book a hotel through a city break operator, the internet or with the hotel? Escape put it to the test. The request: a two-night stay in a double room at the Hotel Rivoli Ramblas, Barcelona, on 19 and 20 October. The results Using a tour operator: Bridge Travel (0870 191 7270).
