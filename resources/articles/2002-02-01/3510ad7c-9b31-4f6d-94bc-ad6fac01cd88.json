The 27-year-old was shortlisted for her series of images called Goftare Nik (Good Words), in which she sought to dispel the exotic view of Iran usually presented in contemporary film and photography from her native country. Her subjects were scenes of everyday life in Tehran - an office block being built, a woman in a chador doing up her son's shoelaces, a bride, a young soldier in uniform, a man in a comfortable living room pointing the remote at a TV out of frame - images remarkable for their banality. The images were then presented in mosaic formations using whole gallery walls. The photographs were sometimes interspersed with paintings by commercial painters more used to painting cinema or political subjects, using Shahbazi's own photos for inspiration. The four other shortlisted artists - Roger Ballen, Elina Brotherus, Philip Lorca diCorcia and Thomas Ruff - each received a cheque for \u00a31,500. The winner was announced by the fashion designer and arts patron Agn\u00e8s b at a champagne reception at the Photographers' Gallery in London. The prize, founded by the Citigroup Private Bank in 1996, aims to reward the individual who has made the most significant contribution to the medium of photography over the past year, through exhibition or publication in Britain. Previous winners of the Citigroup prize include Boris Mikhailov (Ukraine, 2001), Anna Gaskell (USA, 2000), Rineke Dijkstra (Netherlands, 1999), Andreas Gursky (Germany, 1998) and Richard Billingham (UK, 1997). An exhibition of pictures by the finalists, which has been running at the Photographers' Gallery since February 1, has been attracting over 15,000 visitors a week. It continues until March 31."}, "isHosted": false}}}
