I am very happy at the club, with my teammates,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea of leaving does not cross my mind. We need to talk. we have a very good relationship, I am very happy at Paris Saint-Germain.\u201d The 28-year-old also said after PSG\u2019s win over Manchester United last week that he would relish the opportunity to play for the same team as Lionel Messi again, with the Barcelona forward\u2019s contract expiring at the end of this season. \u201cWhat I want most of all is to play with Messi again, to be able to enjoy him once again on the pitch,\u201d said Neymar. \u201cHe can play in my place, I have no problem with that. But I want to play with him next year, for sure.
