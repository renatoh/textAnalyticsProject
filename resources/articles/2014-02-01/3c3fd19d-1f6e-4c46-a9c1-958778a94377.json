In the latest blow to the universal credit scheme, which has fallen behind schedule and will not be fully implemented until halfway through the next parliament, the figures show that \u00a3612m has been spent on introducing the new system since 2010. Just 2,720 people claimed universal credit in October 2013, giving the figure of \u00a3225,000 per claimant. The department is way behind its original target of ensuring that 1m claimants would be moved to universal credit by April this year. If 1m were claiming universal credit the start up costs would be \u00a3612 per person. Duncan Smith was forced to admit last year that he would miss his original deadline of placing all existing and new benefit claimants on universal credit by 2017. It is being introduced in stages and is now \"live\" in seven areas. It will be introduced in Bath and Harrogate this month and in Shotton later this spring. Esther McVey, the work and pensions minister, disclosed how much had so far been spent on UC in a parliamentary reply to Rachel Reeves, the shadow work and pensions secretary. McVey said that the government had spent \u00a3612m of the \u00a32bn earmarked in 2010 for implementing universal credit. The government spent \u00a3100m in 2011-12, \u00a3320m in 2012-13 and \u00a3192m in 2013-14. Chris Bryant MP, the shadow welfare reform minister, said: \"Iain Duncan Smith's flagship policy has been plagued with delay after delay from the outset and millions of pounds have been wasted. We were once told universal credit would be on time and on budget and that a million people would be on the system by April this year, but this has come to nothing. It is staggering that the government has spent \u00a3225,000 per person on this project. \"With poor initial decisions by ministers and endless indecision from Downing Street putting the whole scheme in jeopardy, it is increasingly difficult to have any confidence in the government's handling of welfare.\" A spokesperson for Duncan Smith said: \"If Labour think universal credit can be brought in without spending any money up front it's no wonder they cost taxpayers so much by botching the introduction of tax credits so badly. Over 6m people will be claiming universal credit by 2017, which will bring a \u00a335bn benefit to society, and our safe rollout continues with more people claiming every day.\" Duncan Smith was heavily criticised by MPs over universal credit, which brings together six existing benefits, when he appeared before the commons work and pensions select committee earlier this week. MPs accused the work and pensions secretary of hiding failings in the IT system after he disclosed in his department's annual report \u2013 the day after he gave evidence to the committee \u2013 that \u00a341m had been written off. The National Audit Office (NAO) challenged Duncan Smith's claim that the IT failings had only cost \u00a341m. It said that the DWP had been forced to write down \u00a391m of software assets three times more quickly than had been planned. The department said it had written down, rather than written off, the \u00a391m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
