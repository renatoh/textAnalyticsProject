But it is typical of the heavyweight that when he woke up and discovered his brother Dean had intervened to stop the dramatic incident he wished he had got involved. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what Dean had done,\u201d he said. \u201cI was asleep. I\u2019d trained and jumped on the plane so I was a bit tired. When I woke up I heard all about it. I was disappointed he didn\u2019t hit the guy, I would have just knocked him out, to be honest, because that\u2019s no joking matter. My brother gave him a chance but I would have knocked him out clean. I probably would have hit him on the floor as well.\u201d For someone who relishes a tear-up Whyte has barely laced up his gloves in anger since beating \u00d3scar Rivas in July, due to an adverse finding in a UK Anti-Doping sample. The case is still unresolved, although he has been cleared to fight. He laughs when it is suggested his brother is getting more fights than him at the moment \u2013 but the frustration is evident too. \u201cIt\u2019s been stressful and a few times I\u2019ve thought about walking away from boxing and jacking it in,\u201d admitted Whyte. \u201cI\u2019m not someone to talk about my emotions, but I have been stressed and down and depressed. But my team kept pushing me, urging me to go to the gym and taking the mickey out of me, saying my belly was getting bigger. \u201cI\u2019m a very strong person mentally and physically, but without my team I would have walked away from boxing without a doubt.\u201d But at least one cloud is lifting. On Saturday he returns to the ring to face Mariusz Wach on the undercard of the Andy Ruiz Jnr v Anthony Joshua rematch. \u201cWach is gonna get whacked,\u201d said Whyte. \u201cHe\u2019s very experienced and he knows how to survive. He\u2019s got a very good jab. So it\u2019s up to me to go in there and bring maximum pain, as I do. I will be trying to knock him out. \u201cThe last few months have been tough. But you know me, it doesn\u2019t take much to get me in a fight. And I will come to the ring with maximum violent intentions.\u201d Whyte\u2019s only defeat in 27 fights has come at the hands of Joshua and, as he points out, he has also spent more than 600 days as the No 1 contender with the WBC. \u201cNever in the history of heavyweight boxing has someone been mandatory contender for so long,\u201d Whyte laments. \u201cExcept maybe Jack Johnson and Sonny Liston.\u201d He hopes he will cross paths again with Joshua, who he beat in the amateurs, for a decider. \u201cWe both respect each other but it\u2019s a weird thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like we hate each other, but respect each other. It\u2019s just a job.\u201d He also expects Joshua to regain his WBA, IBF and WBO titles against Ruiz. \u201cHopefully his head is in the right space and he doesn\u2019t listen to all this negativity because as a country we like bringing each other down too much,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone loses, \u2018ah he was rubbish, he was no good\u2019. You weren\u2019t saying that a few months ago when he was heavyweight champion of the world. None of his critics are going to be hall of fame. He will.\u201d As for Whyte himself, he is quietly hopeful of getting his career back on track. \u201cBoxing is a very dark, muddy, murky waters,\u201d he says. \u201cOne day you\u2019re floating and the next day you\u2019re sinking. I\u2019ve learnt a lot of lessons from boxing. It\u2019s made me stronger as a person and given me a better life.\u201d He smiles again. \u201cLife is hard, man. But two things I know are to be brave and to fight. Those are the two things I\u2019m good at.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
