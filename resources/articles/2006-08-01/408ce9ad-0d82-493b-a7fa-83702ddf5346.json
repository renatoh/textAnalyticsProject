The call came from the party's shadow Immigration Minister, Damian Green, who said ministers must 'learn the lessons' of having enormously underestimated the impact of the arrival of tens of thousands of Poles since their country joined in 2004. It was the Tories' first major policy initiative on immigration since David Cameron took over as leader last year with a mandate to change the party's hard-line image. Immigration was a key focus of the campaign for last year's general election, which handed the party its third consecutive defeat. Since taking over, Cameron has given higher priority to issues such as the environment and other 'quality of life' concerns. Conservative sources suggested that the recent media focus on the impact of Polish immigration to Britain, and the reported prospect of 'undesirables' arriving from the new EU states, had prompted the party to re-enter the immigration debate. Last week, the CBI suggested a 'pause before opening up to workers from further new member states, while we learn the lessons from experience to date'. A party spokesman said Green's call should be seen against the background of a 'staggering complacency' in the government's approach to the EU expansion next year. Ministers had predicted that only between 5,000 and 13,000 new immigrants would arrive each year. In fact, some 600,000 newcomers - mostly from Poland - had moved to Britain. Green said the government should 'impose conditions similar to those which other European countries adopted when Poland and other Eastern European countries became members of the EU'. 'By controlling the numbers we can make life much better for everyone,' he said. 'Not only will we ensure the public service and housing infrastructure can cope, but also we will avoid people coming here only to fall into a life of squalor. Controlled immigration also helps to promote much better cohesion between existing and new people in this country.' His comments came ahead of an expected move tomorrow by Cameron to breathe new life into one of his most high-profile reforms, by announcing new measures to promote more women as Tory candidates for Parliament. He is expected to challenge suggestions that his 'A-list' of preferred candidates has failed to dent the party's 'middle-aged white male' image. Cameron will highlight the fact that among candidates chosen to fight seats since he took over as leader, one-third have been women and 10 per cent came from black or other ethnic minority communities - up from a mere 10 per cent in total previously. But his message, according a source close to the Tory leader, will be: 'We can and must do better.' The source told The Observer that while he will stop short of imposing centrally chosen candidates on the party's famously independent local associations, he is expected to announce further changes in the candidate selection procedure to 'ensure that more women get through to the final shortlist' in the selection process."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
