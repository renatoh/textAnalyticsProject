Those who do might well wonder why they bothered: centenarians tend to live a life devoid of much in the way of independence - or dignity. But there are always exceptions, and one of them is Thomas Fletcher Soulby. Soulby turned 100 last month, but he still commands a lifestyle that many 90-year-olds might covet. He has help with his cleaning, gardening and shopping, but he lives alone in the neat little bungalow that he and his late wife retired to in 1971. His lunch is delivered to him, but he prepares his own breakfast (cereal, followed by bacon and tomatoes on toast), and prepares a light tea for himself in the evening. He has plenty to do about the house, and is a devoted sports fan, but if he wants to take some flowers to the crematorium where his wife May was cremated, or perhaps drop by the pensioner's club - well, all he has to do is climb into the 1981 Austin Metro that's parked out in the driveway (with only 24,000 miles on the clock). And off he goes, beholden to no one. Shortly before Soulby's birthday last month, however, this life of liberty was thrown into jeopardy. Soulby had a heart attack, and on the advice of hospital staff, temporarily stopped driving. He duly let the DVLA know what was happening. Then, on his 100th birthday, his GP popped round with a card, and told him that he was going to have to cancel his licence for good. Soulby was devastated, and the story of his driving ban - after 82 years of blame-free driving - became a matter of national media concern. Soulby has became a mini cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, and trying to get an appointment to see him is no easy thing - he has the Gazette and ITV there, and is waiting for the Echo, he says. But he can do the day after tomorrow, as long as it's at 3pm. By the time I arrive outside Soulby's bungalow in the pretty Dorset town of Wimborne Minster, the story has moved on: he has won a reprieve. A positive medical check-up (and, perhaps incidentally, several interventions by the Guardian to the DVLA), and the authority says he can now drive. It's not entirely clear whether his GP (who does have the power to ban him) has relented, or whether there has been a misunderstanding somewhere along the line. Either way, the old man is delighted. Soulby shows me through to his sitting room: there are about 20 birthday cards clogging up the surfaces (one card is from the Queen; another is from David Blunkett, in his work and pensions capacity). Soulby looks about 80, but good for 80, and although he's a bit hard of hearing, and has a few health problems (arthritis being the worst of it), it's clear he's still very much in the world. His parents were both long-lived, he says - his mother was born in 78 and died in 60; his father was born in 69, and died in 57 (one must fill in the 18s and 19s for oneself). He was brought up in Hereford, but later moved to Yorkshire. He has been round cars and engines all his life: after school he went into the motor trade as an apprentice (\"I wasn't clever like my brother\"); later he moved on to aeroplane engines, and during the war worked on the Whitley bomber (\"It was too slow\") and then Lancasters. After that, he went back to cars. \"I could do anything to a car at one time,\" he says. But cars weren't just work to him: he and May loved motoring, and it was after many motoring trips down to Dorset that they decided to retire there. Thomas and May had an unusual history - she was married when they met, and although they lived together as man and wife, it was only after her first husband's death that they married. \"She never lived with him,\" says Soulby. They did not have children, but May had a daughter from her first marriage, and Soulby describes Kathleen, who is 84 this year, as \"my daughter\". May died in 1990, his older brother in 1991, and Kathleen, a widow, lives in Spain. But he has friends, he says, and his neighbours are \"lovely\" - many of the cards are from them. It was awful not being able to drive though, he says. \"My car is everything to me.\" During his month of no driving, taxis twice failed to show - once he had to walk to his club. \"I can't stand for long,\" he says. \"I had to keep sitting down.\" But for a while now at least, it seems there will be no need for taxis. If his health holds up, then he can legally drive until 2007 (the very ancient amongst us must pass a driving test every three years, and Soulby last did one in 2004). Now here comes the awkward bit: will he take me for a drive? He seems remarkably game, despite the horrible presumption of it - me, who did a 15-point-turn while trying to find his bungalow, sitting in judgment on a man who knows how to build a car engine. But he seems impervious to the cheek of it. He leads me out to the car through the kitchen - boxes of medication are set out on the table where he eats all his meals. The car is parked slightly askew, with one back wheel lodged against the kerb: a mortifying minute creeps past as Soulby attempts to reverse out, but is unable to escape. Finally we pull forward, engine revving, and make it out on the second attempt. A minute or two later we're heading off towards the centre of town, which is about half a mile away; he points out his solicitors' offices, and the hotel where he had his 100th birthday party. He keeps within a four-mile radius of home, he says - May's crematorium in Poole is at the outer edge of that. There's a bit of random gear action - second, fourth, second, then third - and a bit of corner cutting, but nothing criminally bad. A few unexpected obstacles leap out at us - a car turning across our path without indicating, some roadworks - and he copes with aplomb. When Soulby is behind the wheel, one gets a glimpse of the man in his prime. He doesn't slow right down for the roundabouts - far from it. He looks ahead, makes a judgment, and then forges round them. When we've done the little tour of the town centre we agreed upon, he decides on a whim to take me on a longer drive, a circuit around the edge of town. We bucket along. \"May loved it here,\" he says, as we pass fields and woods. Did she ever drive? \"No!\" he says. \"I always drove.\""}, "isHosted": false}}}
