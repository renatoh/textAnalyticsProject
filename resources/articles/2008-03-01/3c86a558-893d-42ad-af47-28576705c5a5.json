A visit to Valencia last week meant disappearance into a great football crowd minus the match, a biblical multitude doing the whole Mardi Gras thing and producing quite wonderful immobility and incoherence. Our mistake was to think that you can go to Valencia on a day of Fallas week and just look at the architecture. You can't. Or rather you can look only at the avant garde part of the city, the arched backs of white steel pterodactyls and the long metal arches across which opulent greenery was being trailed, fascinating to see in a year's time. (Southern Spain does wonderful things with trees. At the Alhambra in Granada, Islamic arches are made from trained-together cypresses. Even the roads of fruit and veg. Murcia are lined with hedges of, nor hawthorn, but oranges!) But the important thing about innovative art in New Town Valencia at Easter is that you can walk at leisure and find in one of the challenging structures a boring and essential loo. Nothing like that would be possible in the Old Town. Here, just enough of the Renaissance and Augustan city was apparent over the sea of heads. And they were not quiet crowds. Orwell said amiably that \"Italians can do nothing without making a tremedous noise.\" You can say that again about the Spanish, certainly in Fallas week. The Fallas, particular to Valencia, are great towering dummies, 20-foot-high papier mach\u00e9 politicians and celebrities, waiting to be burned with maximum noise at the end of the week's fiesta. The count-down to the fire is marked daily by early afternoon fireworks, mostly the sort of bangers we warn children against. The official fireworks are then followed by unauthorised ones from a public which likes that sort of thing. Spanish/Valencian noise is of a kind to make this observer spit and cower. Trapped among a minimum of 30,000 people, jamming a pretty wide street, one could have taken it in the religious context, as a foretaste of the Hell which Jean-Paul Sartre so perceptively defined as \"other people\". And so many other people! It is all very alien to the reticent English. A group of ladies in the lovely small town of Olney, home of a great religious poet, William Cowper, come together on Shrove Tuesday to run giggling down the main street, throwing in the air and trying to catch, pancakes. Daft maybe, but a restrained and not very noisy daftness, gentle restraint, very old-style English, with the handsomeness of Olney still easily visible from a modest crowd. Yet all modern pressures run counter to such moderation. They are for excitement and hysteria, the orgiastic BBC continuity girl selling some witless programme later in the day, is unhealthy in a way that traditional Mediterranean-style noise and blow-out are not. The Mediterranean countries, having a tradition of godly commotion and doing their gargantuan thing, do it at fixed and official times. The long scream of American/British commerce and entertainment is something which alas no combustion of celebrities will end. With us today, the hysteria of a religious calendar date is made low-level, perpetual and continuous. Perhaps after all, they order these things better in Spain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
