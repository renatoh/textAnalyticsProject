Instead of waiting for their director of rugby, Mark McCall, to choose his preferred scrum-half, the two rival No9s, Neil de Kock and Richard Wigglesworth, have opted to determine who will start at Twickenham themselves. Coaches will suspect McCall of bottling a key decision but Saracens say the players came up with the idea. The club's rotation policy has meant that De Kock and Wigglesworth have alternated in the starting XV all season. \"Neil and I came up with the idea of tossing a coin because we have played in strict rotation all season,\" said Wigglesworth. \"It seemed the simplest way and Mark agreed.\" De Kock is also happy with the arrangement. \"It might seem unusual but we're both on the same team and we get along really well,\" he said. The outcome of the toss will not be revealed until Friday, when both sides are due to announce their starting XVs. Rumours that the title will now be decided by a game of rock, paper, scissors have yet to be confirmed. The Saracens management reckon there is method to the apparent madness. Whoever starts will be removed after 50 minutes. The theory is that De Kock and Wigglesworth are similar players \u2013 the latter was signed from Sale for that reason \u2013 and disruption will, therefore, be minimal. \"We are very fortunate to have two world-class scrum-halves,\" said Andy Farrell, the coach whose son, Owen, will start at No10 and assume the goalkicking duties. \"We have given them both equal opportunities and the best thing about them is that they don't compete against each other. They talk about what they are going to do and the team flows from that.\" Saracens have also confirmed that the former director of rugby Brendan Venter, who is now the club's technical director, will be at Twickenham. The South African was banned from last year's final, following an altercation in the stands at Leicester. The club's chief executive, Ed Griffiths, said he had asked Leicester to write a letter of support to the Rugby Football Union backing Venter's presence at the 2010 final but that the request was declined. \"I just feel these finals should take place with both coaches present,\" said Griffiths. \"If the roles had been reversed we would certainly have written a letter because we are very happy Richard Cockerill will be at Twickenham.\" The Tigers' director of rugby and his head coach, Matt O'Connor, escaped sanction after an RFU hearing found insufficient evidence to support allegations the pair abused officials in the semi-final against Northampton. Ten Saracens players, meanwhile, have signed new contracts, including lock Mouritz Botha who is set to be included next week in the England Saxons squad for this summer's Churchill Cup. Matt Stevens, who has not played representative rugby since completing a two-year drugs ban, will also be joining the Saxons squad on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
