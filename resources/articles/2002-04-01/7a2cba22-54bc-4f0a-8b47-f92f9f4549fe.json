The band's singer Michael Stipe and Buck's wife Stephanie burst into tears as the jury cleared him of a charge of being drunk on an aircraft last April, two counts of common assault, and one charge of damaging BA crockery. After the verdict, Buck shook hands with junior prosecuting counsel Edward Lewis and told him: \"I'm sorry about this whole situation.\" Buck did not deny his behaviour but claimed a Zolpiden sleeping pill reacted violently with alcohol, turning him into a \"non-insane automaton\". He told the trial at Isleworth crown court that he remembered nothing between shutting his eyes in his first class seat and waking up at Heathrow police station believing he must have suffered a heart attack. David Bate, QC, prosecuting, told the court the sleeping pill story was a \"desperate lie\" told to protect Buck's multimillion pound career. But the jury - who had been sitting opposite Stipe, Mrs Buck and REM bassist Mike Mills for the final week of the trial - evidently disagreed. Leaving court grinning broadly, with an arm around Stipe, Buck thanked the court and jury. \"I'm obviously relieved to be finished here and I am looking forward to returning my attention to my family, to my band, and our music,\" he said. A string of celebrity character witnesses told the court that Buck was not noted for his wild-man tendencies. He was \"famously peaceful\", said Bono, while Michael Stipe described him as a \"southern gentleman\" and likened him to the elder brother he never had. The rampage itself was more Homer Simpson than Liam Gallagher as cabin services director Mario Agius described how Buck brandished a tub of yoghurt in one hand and a spoon in the other. \"I thought he was going to throw it at me so I grabbed hold of his wrist ... at that point the container of yoghurt seemed to explode and cover me from head to foot. [The Stewardess] Holly Ward was also splattered,\" Mr Agius told the court. But it was undoubtedly terrifying for crew and passengers when Buck wrestled with another flight attendant, Nara Incecchi, as he tried to grab the control panel of an exit door and announced that he was \"going home\". Buck was warned by captain Tom Payne, and given the \"yellow card\" BA introduced in 1998 as a final warning for disruptive passengers. He swore and tore the card up in the captain's face. He allegedly told him: \"You are just a fucking captain and I am REM.\" Buck's behaviour deteriorated further with the yoghurt incident, over which the two spattered crew members are now suing him for \u00a35,000 damages. Prosecutor David Bate QC said Buck had also tried to sit next to another female passenger claiming she was his wife, before turning his attention to a hostess trolley, upending it and sending crockery flying. Then, said one witness, he tried to slip a knife up his sleeve as he helped clear up the mess. The mayhem was triggered when Mr Agius refused to serve Buck more alcohol, after topping up his glass 15 times in the course of the 10-hour flight from Seattle to London, where REM were due to play a \"Freedom Day\" concert in Trafalgar Square in honour of Nelson Mandela. A BA spokesman said yesterday: \"Naturally we accept the court's decision but we will continue to treat allegations of assault on our staff and drunkenness on an aircraft extremely seriously and support any prosecutions.\" Buck faced a maximum of two years in prison and a \u00a35,000 fine for being drunk on an aircraft. Other rock stars to have fallen foul of the law include former Stone Roses singer Ian Brown, who spent two months in prison after threatening to chop off an air stewardess's hands during a flight. He also hammered on a flight deck door as the plane came in to land. In 1998 Cathay Pacific banned Liam Gallagher and Oasis for life over their drunken antics and abusive behaviour on a flight from Hong Kong to Australia. Passengers complained that the pop stars bombarded them with food and missiles. The union representing pilots said the jury decision had sent out \"all the wrong signals\". Christopher Darke, general secretary of Balpa, added: \"Pilots, cabin crew and passengers will be upset if not outraged at today's outcome of the Peter Buck case. \"Members of the public, courts and police have to take air rage much more seriously if we are to deter potential offenders.\" REM, the most successful US pop group of all time, were formed in Athens, Georgia, in 1980. Between 1991 and 1995 they released their three most successful albums, which together sold 30 million copies worldwide. Yesterday was the 22nd anniversary of their first concert. In a 1994 interview Tony Blair named them as his favourite band."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
