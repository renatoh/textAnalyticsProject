Such regular movement of ministers means that Whitehall does not work effectively and results in a form of paralysis both before and after each change, the MPs said. As a result, the committee calls for secretaries of state to be left in their posts for five years unless they are changed for a specific reason, rather than habit. The findings come amid reports David Cameron is to reshuffle junior and middle ranking ministers in July. The report praises the prime minister for previously resisting regular cabinet reshuffles, having had only one major change in lineup since the general election in May 2010. Graham Allen, the chair of the committee, said that constant ministerial changes hinder parliament's ability to hold government to account. \"In the UK, we've got used to having reshuffles every couple of years, but other countries manage very well without them. \"Every time there is a reshuffle, it is proceeded by months of speculation about who will move where, which in itself causes a kind of paralysis within government. \"I hope our report will encourage future prime ministers to follow [Cameron's] example. We call for secretaries of state to be left in post for the length of a parliament. Taken together with the advent of fixed-term parliaments, this should enable them to make a real difference.\" Some reshuffling of ministers is inevitable because of resignations and illness but they have become a habit, the report says. There will be times when a fresh perspective is useful, but most major government policies will benefit from having continuity of ministers in the responsible department, it claims. A majority of the committee concluded that there should be a specific minister in the Cabinet Office who is responsible for ministerial development. He or she should oversee ministerial training and appraisal and there should be compulsory training for all new ministers, continuous professional development for those with experience and basic training for shadow ministers in the 12 months before the expected date of a general election, the report states. Outgoing ministers should hand over directly to their successors, rather than relying exclusively on the civil service to conduct handovers, it concludes. Cameron is expected to announce a series of mini reshuffles in the coming months in an effort to strengthen his frontbench and quell disquiet among backbenchers, senior MPs said. A rearrangement of the junior ministerial ranks is expected in July, followed by a cabinet reshuffle in September."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
