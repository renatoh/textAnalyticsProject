It is where we live right now and, increasingly, it no longer seems enough. Having spent a hellish few hours amid the cheap sensationalism of the Saatchi Gallery recently, Modern Art's extraordinary exhibition renewed my faith in the power of art - yes, even conceptual art - as a provocation rather than as an entertainment. Under the intriguing title, Wherever I Am , the show brings together the work of two contemporary conceptual artists, Yael Bartana, an Israeli, and Emily Jacir, a Palestinian, both of whom challenge the received notions of identity and belonging that their respective nationalities insist on. And in the middle of their interwoven artistic journeys, it relocates the work of Lee Miller, the only female war photographer present at the liberation of Dachau. This is a brave, and uncomfortable, juxtaposition, and I am still not entirely sure the inclusion of Miller's work in this context entirely works formally or thematically. Nevertheless, it does ask questions not normally asked by most curators of art these days, and it may leave you reeling from a kind of political, as well as an emotional, sensory overload. Literally within minutes, for instance, you can move from a video of Israeli anti-Sharon demonstrators being treated harshly by their own army to a photograph of freed Jewish prisoners awaiting the arrival of bread in a newly liberated camp to a jumpy film of Palestinians crossing the Surda military checkpoint on foot on their way to and from work every day. The most moving piece of conceptual work here is also the most simple, Jacir's beautifully executed Where We Come From, which consists of two rooms full of photographs, texts and one flickering video image all dealing with the theme of exile. Jacir, who possesses an American passport, and thus has a freedom of movement denied most Palestinians, simply asked a number of acquaintances, some exiles, some displaced in the Occupied Territories, 'If I could do something for you anywhere in Palestine, what would it be?' She then carried out, and recorded, their requests. 'Go to Jaffa, find my family home, and take a picture,' asks Ibrahim, born in Tripoli, living in New York; 'Go to my mother's grave, and put flowers, and pray,' says Munir, born in Jerusalem, living in nearby Bethlehem but denied the right of travel. 'Go to the Israeli post office in Jerusalem and pay my phone bill,' requests another displaced Palestinian, who lives in Area C, where the phone service is controlled by the Israelis, but who is forbidden to set foot in Jerusalem. The Kafkaesque nightmare that attends displacement and forced resettlement is driven home time and time again. Yael Bartana's video installations do not possess the emotive power of Jacir's work but they are quietly provocative in a way that stays with the viewer long afterwards. The first room is given over to a work entitled Trembling Time , in which Bartana filmed traffic from a flyover in Tel Aviv. Cars and lorries roll by underneath, occasionally slowed down, then stopped altogether. Suddenly, a siren sounds and, one by one, people stop their cars and get out to stand to attention beside them. It is the annual Soldier Memorial Day ritual, when life comes to a halt in memory of the Israeli war dead, but, here, it possesses an eerier resonance, as if denoting a society controlled by an all-powerful and unseen power. Like Jacir, Bartana's work also comprises secretly filmed footage: Orthodox Jewish children dressed up for the annual festival of Purim, which celebrates the rescue of the Jews from their enemies; a glimpse of an all-male celebration later the same evening. Here, the enclosed world of the Orthodox Jewish faith seems another level of protection in a society under siege from contemporary enemies from within and without. While Jacir's work attests to the fact that there is no such thing as 'normality' for Palestinians estranged from their land, Bartana's tells us over and over that the enforced normalisation of Israeli life is destructive in an altogether more insidious way. Amid all these multilayered and thought-provoking images, Lee Miller's vintage war photographs seem relatively straightforward. She was that rare thing, a fashion photographer who made the leap into reportage, and imbued all her work with an eye for the unexpected, perhaps a gift encouraged by the great surrealist photographer Man Ray, one of her mentors. The glamorous and the ominous converge in images such as Fire Masks, Hampstead London, 1941, in which two models pose in metal face visors that could have been made by Duchamp or Dal\u00ed. For a postwar Vogue shoot she posed a beauty wearing a 'quilted windbreak' in Place Vend\u00f4me before a window pockmarked with bullet holes. It is her war photography that startles though, not least the famous photograph of Hitler's house ablaze, or the almost sacred imagery of The Burgermeister's Daughter. Leipzig, Germany 1945, a portrait of a young Nazi woman who had just committed suicide, and who had, as Miller noted, 'extraordinarily pretty teeth'. Her images from the liberation of Dachau remain among the most disturbing examples of the the artist as witness, albeit from a time when the lines were drawn more clearly, and the moral high ground much easier to distinguish. Had she been alive now, though, her path would undoubtedly have crossed, if not physically, at least thematically, with the two young artists featured here. As their complex web of images show, we need artists as witnesses now as much as ever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
