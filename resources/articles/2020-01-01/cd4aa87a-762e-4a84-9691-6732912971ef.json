The March for Life demonstration has been organized since 1973 and Roe v Wade, the landmark supreme court decision that legalized abortion nationally. In the decades since, the march has become a tradition for many with a conservative or religious objection to abortion, a ritual they hope will return America to a time when abortion was clandestine, even as many countries around the world liberalize abortion laws. \u201cI\u2019m very passionately Catholic, and so it goes against everything I\u2019ve ever been taught in my life,\u201d said Shawna Queen, a mother from Portsmouth, Ohio, who brought three generations of her family with her. She started to cry while describing abortion. \u201cI just think it\u2019s a travesty that we kill the unborn,\u201d she said. Attendance hit a high-water mark in 2009, just after Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration. But this year will hold special significance for many. Where once there was doubt about Donald Trump\u2019s anti-abortion bona fides \u2013 he once called himself \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d \u2013 that has long been forgotten, at least publicly. Red Make America Great Again hats were omnipresent at Friday\u2019s demonstration. Trump this year became the first president ever to address the march in person. In previous years, Mike Pence, the vice-president, attended, and Trump relayed video messages to attendees. The president\u2019s administration is responsible for putting abortion rights on exceptionally shaky ground. A conservative-leaning supreme court, with two justices of Trump\u2019s choosing, is set to hear its first abortion case in March. Some signs at the protest read \u201cMost Pro-life President Ever\u201d with an image of Trump in red. A majority of Americans still support abortion rights, and oppose efforts to overturn Roe v Wade: those opinions have shifted little in the decades since abortion was legalized. However, where supporters of reproductive rights considered the issue a settled matter, opponents saw Roe as a target to aim at. Emboldened by Trump\u2019s anti-abortion rhetoric, states have worked to overturn Roe v Wade and undermined states\u2019 rights and services along the way. A wave of the strictest anti-abortion laws in decades swept across the south and midwest last year. Many laws banned abortion at the sixth week, before most women know they are pregnant. The laws are all unconstitutional, as long as Roe stands, and none have gone into effect. \u201cMy hope is there will be a law that will not allow abortion to continue happening,\u201d said Gladys Kohr, who came to the march in a full-sized bus wrapped in pro-Trump images. Abortion \u201cshould be illegal\u201d, she said. Behind Kohr, the bus sported pro-Trump memes. One image showed Trump\u2019s head superimposed on the body of a boxer, and said \u201cReady for Round Two\u201d. In another, Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth wore a Maga hat and gave a thumbs-up. Kohr said she would support punishment for women who have abortions, and doctors who perform them \u2013 \u201csomething very severe\u201d. But she said women should be given information about abortion before being allowed to undergo the procedure. Even so, the crowd was not monolithic. Pat O\u2019Kane from California, who attended with a group called Feminists for Life, was wary of the movement\u2019s adulation of Trump. \u201cI sort of take the biblical position \u2013 we should not put our faith in princes,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any one president, or even a succession of presidents, is necessarily the answer.\u201d One surprise was the common ground between the anti-abortion and pro-choice movements on other women\u2019s issues. Many attendees said they supported paid maternity leave, usually considered a progressive cause. The US is the only developed country that does not mandate maternity leave. Many also supported better workers\u2019 protections for pregnant women. But it is the primacy of abortion has turned the issue into a gaping political wound. For many protesters, abortion represented their No 1 voting issue, eclipsing policies that might otherwise support pregnant women and mothers. Anti-abortion leaders have sought to blur this image. This year\u2019s theme is \u201cLife empowers: pro-life is pro-woman\u201d. It is meant to commemorate the centennial of women\u2019s right to vote in the US, ratified in 1920. Queen, from Ohio, said: \u201cI absolutely think that maternity leave should be an everyday practice in our country. I always vote. [But] I don\u2019t even have a party any more. I vote on how I can sleep at night,\u201d she said, referring to abortion. Most often, that means voting Republican. Republicans have attempted to capitalize on this apparent soft spot, but have only introduced plans to allow workers to borrow against their future retirement benefits. Such proposals have not received any broad-based support. Kaleb Pandorf, 20, from Smyrna, Tennessee, said he supported same-sex marriage and, unlike much of the crowd here, does not consider himself a Christian. But if a candidate were to promise to end abortion and same-sex marriage, he would value abortion above all, he said. \u201cAs much as I hate to say it, I\u2019d have to, I\u2019d have to support him,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause he sees the wrong in killing a child.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
