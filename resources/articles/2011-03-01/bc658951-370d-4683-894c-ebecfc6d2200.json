The Chauvet cave was closed to the public by the French government immediately after it was discovered in 1994 and has never been opened for public viewing since. Only a small number of researchers have seen the art in person (Deep impact, 25 March, page 13, Film&amp; Music). \u2022\u2008The physicist Brian Cox is not an elected fellow of the Royal Society, as we described him (Better than rock'n'roll, 24 March, page 5, G2). He has a university research fellowship. The same article described Cox as standing \"legs akimbo\". Arms can be akimbo, legs can't. It means hands on hips, with the elbows outwards. \u2022\u2008A photograph with an article about university fees was captioned: \"Graduates at St Andrews in their robes.\" The people shown were wearing red undergraduate gowns (Free education for young Scots? 26 March, page 35). \u2022\u2008Homophone corner: \"Everything here in Highgate is buzzing with life: the magnolia by my window is out, the blackbirds are singing, the sweet peas I've sewn in a pot on my balcony are coming up.\" (The secret of happiness, 26 March, page 34.)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
