In the spring of 2010, for instance, when Sky launched its sports/comedy panel show A League Of Their Own, and I suggested it was not funny, and that its host, James Corden, was way too pleased with himself, I worried I might be responsible for snuffing the show out at birth, putting dozens of people out of work. I cannot find the original piece, but I bet I even put \"comedy\" in quotes as my particularly hilarious satirical boot to the solar plexus. I visualised the commissioning people at Sky reading the piece, being forced to look back at the show, and exclaiming: \"By jove!\" (To be honest, I doubt anyone at Sky talks like Wilfrid Hyde-White, but the sentiments will have been similar.) \"By jove! That chap at the Guardian has us bang to rights. It's not funny.\" I imagined them maybe bringing in comedy specialists to examine the show for traces of humour, the upshot being a neat little pile of P45s for Corden, Jamie Redknapp et al to come in and collect on Tuesday morning. This was not a scenario I relished, but a necessary public service, I thought. Well, so much for the power of the press. A League Of Their Own is now into its triumphant fourth series, one of Sky's most successful \"original\" formats (ooh, there he goes again with the quotes), Corden's self-delight continues to make Piers Morgan look like a poster boy for low self-esteem, and genuine laughs remain in shorter supply than Sepp Blatter's black friends. Nonetheless, all the other Question Of Sport/They Think It's All Over clones have been seen off to the TV format scrapyard, and it is this writer, rather than Sky, who has to take a long, hard look at himself, and wonder if he has missed something. I think it was the great philosopher Dolly Parton who once said: \"You'd be surprised how much money it costs to look this cheap,\" and it is a lesson Sky has heeded, lavishing money on a slick production, while also taking on board the lesson of the BBC's Teletubbies, which I was told appeals to toddlers mainly because of the noise, the colour and the constant repetition. Without striving to be the intellectual equal of the Teletubbies, A League of Their Own is certainly colourful and, if the latest edition is anything to go by, is still repeating the joke about how drunk Freddie Flintoff was after England's Ashes triumph. As to noise, a fanatically enthusiastic studio audience \u2013 to whom, judging by the paroxysms of mirth, the producers have taken the sensible precaution of screening an entirely different programme \u2013 takes care of that. The most noise, though, as another philosopher, not Dolly Parton, once said, is made by empty vessels, and if you are looking for emptiness, in every sense of the word, look no further than guest Jimmy Carr's contribution this week. In a round about pets owned by sports people, it emerged that Wayne Rooney owns a French mastiff. \"Did he buy it on the internet?\" asked Carr. \"Did he think he was getting something else? To help him with the nannas?\" It is difficult to say for certain, but I am assuming the joke (I am keeping the inverted commas in reserve, in case I need them later) stems from the presence of the syllable \"stiff\" in the word \"mastiff\", and relies on the audience's memory of an ancient tabloid newspaper story about Rooney's love life, on which Carr feels it necessary to add a prompt. Nor was that the low point. In another round, Flintoff was dressed as a tennis umpire, and panellist John Bishop asked him: \"Would you go out in that?\" \"Would I fuck!\" answered the Oscar Wilde of cricket. And that was it. No explanation, no punchline, just gales of laughter from the studio audience. Think of that, comedy writers, spending hours agonising over whether mackerel is funnier than haddock; no punchline. This could be the labour-saving device you have been looking for. Finally, one hesitates to return to the subject of Match of the Day as it settles into its new home in Salford, but would it be possible for someone to have a word with Alan Shearer about his grammar? It must have become apparent at an early stage in the Norwich City-Arsenal match that Theo Walcott was repeatedly speeding past the opposing full\u2011back, that Shearer's analysis would draw attention to this and that he would say, as he invariably does: \"He done it all afternoon.\" \"No Alan,\" someone could have said, politely and respectfully, \"he did it all afternoon, not 'he done it all afternoon'.\" I am not asking former professional footballers to be Dr David Starkey, but Shearer gives us \"He done it\" nearly every week, and it is quite a simple matter to correct. Think of the children."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
