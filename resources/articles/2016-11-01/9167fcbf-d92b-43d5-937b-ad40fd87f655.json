This morning, just after 6am, I took four guys who came in from Gatwick just for the weekend. The weather is good for business.\u201d Yesterday pockets of northern Britain were hit by heavy snow showers, while the south awaited the wrath of Angus, the first named storm of the season. But in European ski resorts, the falling white powder was being greeted with joy, as the continent anticipated some of the best pre-Christmas skiing for years. Verbier, one of Switzerland\u2019s premier ski resorts, is not alone in being blessed with snow. Across the Alps, the white stuff is falling in rare abundance. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible, the best start to a season I can remember,\u201d said Veronica Hamilton, site manager for the Evolution2 ski school in the upmarket French resort of Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re. In neighbouring Tignes, its glacier opened on 1 October and the slopes below it are now groomed with real snow, rather than the artificial stuff they might expect to be using so low down at this time of year. Elsewhere in France, Val Thorens, Montgen\u00e8vre and Chamonix are among the resorts that kicked off their seasons this weekend, considerably earlier than normal. And even these resorts are comparatively late to the party. Last week skiing could be had, albeit for a limited time and on a limited number of runs, in places as diverse as Feldburg in Germany, Zermatt in Switzerland, Senales in Italy and Austria\u2019s Obergurgl region. There was even early season skiing in Scotland. The Lecht in the Cairngorms managed to open three lifts last Sunday. Skiers will remember that two years ago the snow also fell early. But a long, warm, dry spell dented their hopes of it turning into a memorable season. Several major French resorts were even closed on Christmas Day. Last season was even worse. Many resorts struggled for snow \u2013 real or artificial \u2013 until mid-January. A dry summer had depleted reservoirs, so the snow cannon had no ammunition. \u201cThe start of last season was probably the worst one in my memory,\u201d said Dan Fox, managing director of skiweekends.com who has been in the business for more than a quarter of a century. By contrast, this year\u2019s summer has been wetter and temperatures in November have stayed lower. The forecast for much of Europe is for more snow in the coming fortnight. There have been huge dumps this weekend over much of the Alps. On Saturday morning, Olaf Adamec, who runs the Evolution2 ski school in Morzine in France\u2019s Portes Du Soleil ski region, was sitting inside a coffee shop in the town centre looking up at the sky. The heavy overnight rain was turning to snow and the nursery slopes were being bleached white before his eyes. Adamec said the high-altitude resort of Avoriaz above the town already has more than a metre of snow on its slopes. \u201cI went up there last weekend with my kids and it was mad. Everyone was up there ski-touring.\u201d At only 1,000 metres, Morzine is rated a low-altitude resort. \u201cWe never have snow at this time of year,\u201d said Andy Green, who runs airport taxi-shuttle service skitransfers.com. \u201cBy the end of the day, you can guarantee there will be a delivery truck in a ditch somewhere.\u201d Traffic problems aside, locals are convinced this is shaping up to be a promising season. \u201cYou talk to the old guys and they say there are a lot of berries on the trees,\u201d Adamec said. \u201cThey say this is so the birds can feed themselves because it\u2019s going to be a long, cold winter.\u201d Rarely has a strong season been needed more. This year, Christmas Day and New Year\u2019s Day fall on a Sunday. For an industry that operates mainly Saturday to Saturday, this is a real problem. Few people want to travel on Christmas Eve or New\u2019s Year Eve. But the promise of exceptional conditions might just change their minds. \u201cThe last two years have been appalling in terms of early snow,\u201d said Frank McCusker, chief executive of the Ski Club of Great Britain. \u201cIf you were looking to go skiing in December or the early part of January, it was not a great experience. If it happens one year, people think it\u2019s not going to happen again, but two years in a row and they get very concerned. This is going to give a tremendous boost to confidence.\u201d Another concern is sterling\u2019s abject slide against the euro. Almost 1.2 million Britons enjoy a ski holiday each year. If they take fright at the high cost, an already fragile industry will be left reeling. True, currency fluctuations are nothing new. \u201cBut it\u2019s the speed of change this time,\u201d Fox said. \u201cThe pound has gone from \u20ac1.40 last winter to starting this winter at \u20ac1.15, if we are lucky. It\u2019s that change that makes people uncomfortable.\u201d Surveys conducted by the Ski Club suggest avid skiers will not be deterred by more expensive holidays. But around a fifth believe they will rein in their spending. \u201cThey will spend less on apr\u00e8s-ski or, rather than stay in a four-star hotel, go for a three-star,\u201d McCusker said. This is a gloomy prediction for an industry operating on the margins, having slashed prices as a result of intense competition and the emerging threat of Airbnb. \u201cThere\u2019s a real nervousness around booking ski holidays now,\u201d Fox said. \u201cThe big operators were discounting very early this year.\u201d A glance at some of the chalet deals currently on offer confirms this view. A pre-Christmas week in Verbier can be had for under \u00a3500 all in, including flights and meals. Chalet operators that sold holidays aggressively over the summer are now ruing their success. Having priced their holidays in sterling, they face a crippling spike in costs. \u201cThey sold a lot of holidays against an exchange rate they are now not going to achieve, so they\u2019re not going to make any money,\u201d Fox said. \u201cHopefully, no operator will crash this season, but a lot of the smaller operators may decide to call it a day, with the result that the chalet market will become increasingly expensive.\u201d And this is all before the UK leaves the EU. Currently, most ski holiday operators effectively employ their staff in the UK and, under European law, second them to the country where they are working. They pay them a minimum wage that complies with UK law and pay tax in the UK. But, in 2014, Switzerland insisted all chalet staff had to be paid the Swiss minimum wage. This took the minimum wage of the average chalet worker to \u00a324,000 a year. \u201cAll the chalet operators dropped Switzerland apart from the high-end guys,\u201d Fox said. Austria has followed suit with similar consequences. Fox said: \u201cAt the point we say we are leaving the EU, the French can quite rightly turn round and say: \u2018Stuff you, EU law doesn\u2019t apply to the UK any more, you\u2019re in France so you stick to French law.\u2019 The consequence of this is that chalet operators are going to have a very, very substantial increase in costs. There is really a fear that the chalet model is severely at risk over the next few years.\u201d And yet in Morzine yesterday, as the snow fell and the town was transformed into a picture perfect postcard, the focus was on the season ahead. Ski hire shops, bars and restaurants were scrambling to be ready for the unexpected early start. The town, normally somnolent in November, was starting to come alive.Global warming, currency crashes and Brexit may be threatening havoc on the industry but, for now at least, the future can wait. There is a lot of powder to be found."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
