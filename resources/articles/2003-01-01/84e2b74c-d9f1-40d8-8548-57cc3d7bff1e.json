The charity is also halving its funding to scores of local societies for the blind and is planning to increase its charges on the work it does for councils and the health service. In addition to the redundancies, it is doing away with 50 currently vacant positions including three at assistant director level. In total the charity will cut 5% of its workforce of 3,000. The measures are being introduced in response to the charity's financial crisis, revealed in the Guardian last November. A drop in money left in wills, which represent an unusually large part of its income, is the main reason for the cash problem. Last year it received \u00a332m in legacies, which was 36% of its income; this year legacies are projected to fall to just \u00a325m. The downturn in the stock market has also taken its toll. The value of RNIB's investments has fallen by almost a quarter in the current financial year and it has been forced to top up its employer's contribution by \u00a3500,000 to its pension funds. An RNIB spokeswoman explained that the charity was trying to avoid making cuts to frontline services. Jon Barrick, RNIB community services director, appealed to the public for more donations: \"With better support from health and social care authorities, and public generosity, we hope to improve and develop our services for the growing numbers of blind and partially sighted people in the future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
