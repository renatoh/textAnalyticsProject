More than 20 industry representatives, health advocates and politicians spoke on Tuesday afternoon at the hearing to discuss mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposal. Under the mayor's plan, food outlets that require a health inspection, including restaurants, mobile food carts, movie theaters, sports arenas and delis must limit the cup and container size for soda to a maximum of 16 fluid ounces. The hearing was intended to be an opportunity for the public weigh in on the ban but there is no guarantee that their voices will be heard, because the measure only needs approval from the board of health to be adopted. The commissioner of the board of health supports the ban. Those opposed to the ban argued that outlawing large sodas was an arbitrary move and a misuse of resources in the effort to fight citywide obesity. \"I am not overweight because of Big Gulp sodas, frankly I am overweight because I eat too much pasta, pastrami sandwiches, pizza, bagels and cream cheese, red velvet cake, cheesecake,\" said Brooklyn borough president Marty Markowitz. Markowitz said the city would be better off putting its money towards programs that encouraged physical activity in low-income neighborhood residents and adolescents. Both sides argued that the opposition was a threat to low-income community members, adolescents and small-business owners. But two hours into the event, only politicians and advocacy groups from those communities had spoken, not unaffiliated individuals. David Jones of the Community Service Society of New York, a group that fights poverty in the city, said that junk food culture is a direct attack on poor communities and equated the soda market with the drug market. Jones said: \"It's not quite as good as selling drugs, but it's pretty close\" He voiced his disgust with the beverage companies for helping co-ordinate a 'Million Big Gulp March' against the ban. \"To suddenly make a sham of that, to equate civil rights and the struggle that is occurring in poor neighborhoods, particularly for the young, to this right to sell non-nutritional substances to young people is an outrage, and it has to be fought,\" said Jones. City council member Dan Halloran spoke at the Million Big Gulp March and further dramatized the soda battle during the hearing by employing some familiar rhetoric: When they came for the cigarettes, I didn't say anything, I didn't smoke. When they came for the MSG, I really didn't care because I didn't order it very often. I am not a big salt eater, so I didn't mind when you guys regulated salt. But what will the government be telling me next? What time to go to bed? How big my steak should be? How many potato chips I can have? I mean its all in the name of health, and clearly the government knows what's best The proposal was made public 12 June and the final vote on the proposal is set for 13 September. If the department of health adopts the rule, it will take effect six months later. The restriction applies to drinks that contain more than 25 calories per 8 fluid ounces, but does not include diet sodas or milk-based drinks such as coffee. Customers can also purchase multiple drinks under the size limit and refills are allowed. New Yorkers for Beverage Choices organized a rally at City Hall on Monday ahead of Tuesday's public hearing. The coalition said it delivered more than 90,000 protest petitions from New Yorkers who oppose the ban. The coalition is funded by soda companies and is comprised of business owners, city council members and a variety of unions and food industry associations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
