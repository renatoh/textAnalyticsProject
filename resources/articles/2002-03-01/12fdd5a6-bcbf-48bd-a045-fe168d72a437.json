But, more important, it is a brilliant love story that resonates to bittersweet effect. George Remus was a notorious Cincinnati bootlegger with a touch of the Gatsbys who, in 1927, killed his wife Imogene, a jazz-age beauty with a subtle dark side. To everyone's surprise, he chose to defend himself in court even though he did not deny the crime. As Holden traces the story of George and Imogene through the eyes of lawyers and witnesses, a dazzling tale of amour fou against the fascinating background of the prohibition years unfolds. Holden's previous novel, Four Corners of Night, raised the police procedural to new heights of poignancy; here he switches genre with deft assurance to unforgettable effect. James Crumley is the grizzly old bear of American hardboiled fiction; The Final Country (HarperCollins, \u00a312.99) sees the return of Milo Milodragovitch, one of his bruised and violent alter egos. Stuck in the hellhole of Texas, Milo collides with a tall black man who has just killed a drug dealer, bringing him out of retirement and smack into the worst trouble he could have imagined. No one writes about the forlorn American landscape and the sorrow of ageing men like Crumley, a poet who wields his pen like an automatic. The sad ending is inevitable but the ride is exhilarating, as Milo yearns for Montana and innocence past. A treat. New books from George P Pelecanos and Joe R Lansdale confirm their status as masters of American noir. Hell to Pay (Orion, \u00a312.99) is the second in Pelecanos's Washington DC-set series featuring black private investigator Derek Strange and his ambiguous sidekick Terry Quinn. The nightmare of DC's squalor in the shadow of the White House and the senseless deaths of drug wars and racism are an indictment of the US today. Pelecanos has never been so angry, and Strange's ghetto-style revenge on the manipulators who pull the strings of the haves and the have-nots proves dark and powerful. Lansdale's Captains Outrageous (Weidenfeld, \u00a39.99) sees the return of his larger-than-life antiheroes, Hap Collins and Leonard Pine. Colourful, profane and with an injection of black humour that borders on bad taste, this is another high-octane race through the Texas badlands, with a rising body count and thrills galore. A rewarding romp. Never Count Out the Dead (Macmillan, \u00a310), Boston Teran's follow-up to his prizewinning blacker-than-black debut, God is a Bullet , is a sad disappointment. The brooding atmosphere and sharp violence are still present, but the elements never quite gel. The revenge of a small-town sheriff left for dead by an evil mother and daughter duo makes for compulsive reading, and the intensity of the characters touches many a raw nerve, but one gets the feeling that Teran is going through the motions. More down-to-earth is David Lawrence's The Dead Sit Round in a Ring (Michael Joseph, \u00a39.99), a British debut set in London's Notting Hill. DS Stella Mooney proves an interesting new protagonist as she investigates a curious murder which soon spills into her personal life, against a background of eastern European vice rings and internet misdeeds. An author and a character to watch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
