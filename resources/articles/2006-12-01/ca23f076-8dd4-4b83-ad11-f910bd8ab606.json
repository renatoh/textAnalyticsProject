Ledley King and Paul Robinson both made mistakes as Newcastle scored three times to leave Chelsea the only team with a record superior to theirs in the past 11 games. Less than two months after their supporters demonstrated angrily in the wake of a 1-0 defeat by Sheffield United, Newcastle are eyeing European qualification again. Manager Glenn Roeder said: 'I can't give the whole squad enough credit because we weren't in a good position 10 weeks ago. 'I was demanding a win to get us to 25 points at the halfway stage; to get there is an outstanding achievement because we had every excuse to buckle under the amount of games and the amount of injuries. Footballers have been known to take any excuse, but you can't accuse this lot of doing that.' Newcastle's confidence was reflected in an exhilarating start that earned them two goals in the opening seven minutes, with Kieron Dyer making the breakthrough after only 139 seconds. Tottenham had almost scored seconds earlier when Steed Malbranque's header was blocked, but two clearances from Nolberto Solano and Obafemi Martins left Dyer one-on-one with King. The defender, twisting and turning as he backtracked, still allowed Dyer too much space, on which he capitalised by stylishly curling his shot inside a post. Martins added Newcastle's second goal when he headed in a cross from Scott Parker, who appeared to be offside as he collected a pass from James Milner inside the penalty area. Tottenham had to respond swiftly and they did: in the 15th minute Danny Murphy - drafted in when Jermain Defoe was injured in the warm-up - located space for a shot that struck Steven Taylor and was diverted past Shay Given. The goal sparked Tottenham's best spell of the match, but Newcastle took advantage of another defensive error in the 34th minute to regain control. Milner's free-kick should have been collected by goalkeeper Paul Robinson, but Newcastle seized on his fumble, with Taylor and Martins having shots blocked before Parker forced it over the line. Tottenham had still contributed enough to the first half to suggest that Newcastle's two-goal cushion was far from secure and that point was emphasised by the way they started after the interval. Dimitar Berbatov was inches away from scoring in the second minute of the half after edging clear of Peter Ramage - the only mistake of the game by the impressive 23-year-old defender. Newcastle regained control and almost scored a fourth in the 80th minute, but Robinson saved from Martins. By the end, Newcastle were relaxed enough to allow Pavel Srnicek a farewell five minutes in goal in place of Shay Given, who has a slight groin strain. It was a gesture appreciated by 38-year-old Srnicek, whose three-month stay at the club he served for seven years in the 1990s is nearing its end. Martin Jol, the Tottenham manager, said: 'All credit to Newcastle. They played in an aggressive and clinical manner, particularly in the centre of the park. The score was horrendous, but we could have had a far better result. We just weren't clinical enough.' Man of the match: Kieron Dyer The striker's superbly taken goal after 139 seconds was the highlight of the game and though he rarely threatened to in\ufb02ict similar damage, his energy and pace were a constant worry to Tottenham's defence and generated most of the game's exciting moments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
