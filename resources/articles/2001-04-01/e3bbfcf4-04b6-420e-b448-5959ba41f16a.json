Jack Greenberg, chairman and chief executive, said the group was \"optimistic that lingering concerns about beef will continue to lessen as the year progresses\". European consumers started to shun beef last year once BSE spread across the continent. Shares in McDonald's rose 1% yesterday to $27.78 in spite of a 16% drop in first-quarter earnings. The company has also blamed waning European sales for a rare profits decline three months ago. Sales in Europe, which ac count for a quarter of the total, fell 6% in the first quarter to $2.18bn. Sales in the US market rose 4% to $4.68bn in spite of the weakening economy. The 16% fall in profits to $378m, or 29 cents a share, met analysts' expectations, which were lowered last month because of fears about infected beef and the economic outlook. Mr Greenberg said he was pleased with the company's performance given the \"challenges\" of the beef crisis as well as comparisons with a strong year last year. Results should continue to improve by 6 -10% in constant currencies this year after a better second half. \"We continue to proactively educate our European cus tomers about McDonald's high food safety and quality standards, which lead the industry and provide the benchmark for safe food around the world,\" he said in a statement. \"We are also promoting menu variety and value, and the results have been encouraging.\" Comparable sales improved in several main European markets in March. Beef sales have fallen in much of continental Europe as well as Britain since late last year when BSE was found in herds in several countries. McDonald's, which operates more than 28,000 restaurants in about 120 countries, said little about the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in parts of Europe, where farmers have been forced to destroy beef herds. That disease is also understood to have had a detrimental impact on beef sales. Non-US restaurants account for more than 60% of the Illinois-based company's sales and more than 50% of profits. \u0095 The McDonald's branch in the main street of Quebec city's old quarter adopted a policy of anonymity yesterday in anticipation of being a prime target for protesters during this weekend's Summit of the Americas. McDonald's, frequently a target of the anti-globalisation movement, has removed its familiar red and yellow signboard. French farmer Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, who won fame damaging a McDonald's branch in France, has flown in to join the protesters' ranks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
