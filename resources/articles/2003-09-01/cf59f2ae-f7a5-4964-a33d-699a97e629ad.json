The result is plain in both senses of the word - in employment profile, many UK firms are still about as diverse as a row of filing cabinets. Over the UK as a whole, women make up half the workforce but just 9 per cent of management grades and 2 per cent of senior management. Ethnic minorities represent just 1.5 per cent of all managers and are practically non-existent at senior or partnership level. After many false dawns, however, the institutionalised whiteness (some give it a pithier name) of business seems at last to be blistering. Progress is uneven and slow, and in some areas has barely started. Yet there are grounds for cautious optimism that the movement, once started, will become unstoppable, says Professor Amin Rajan, co-author of a report on Harnessing Workforce Diversity to Raise the Bottom Line released this week (www.create-research.co.uk). Why should this time be different? Well, for the first time, companies are beginning to see that it pays. The business case has long been put forward as an article of faith, but recently there has been a subtle change, says Rajan: 'Instead of thinking of diversity as about equality, that is, in terms of the law or compliance, companies are now seeing it as an issue of merit and merit alone.' Put crudely, 'pale, male and stale' is no longer a winning business formula. There are two parts to the case. The first is the market argument, which says that customers want to be served by a company and workforce they can identify with - so a company with a predominantly white male sales force, for example, is automatically limiting its scope. The force of this argument is underlined by US estimates of the colossal buying power of different demographic groups: $1 trillion in the case of women, $550bn for African Americans, $360bn for Hispanic Americans and $460m for the disabled, according to a 2001 Conference Board study. At the same time, 80 per cent of new entrants to the US labour market are other than white males. Similar considerations apply in the UK. As one company sums it up: 'The market is driving the diversity agenda.' The second part of the business case is the innovation argument, which suggests that teams made up of mixed ethnicities, backgrounds and gender are likely to be more creative than homogenised ones. The latter, especially, raises plenty of management questions - there's no point in recruiting for difference then forcing it into the same old conformist hierarchy, or in simply using it on the margins, as frequently happens. But among the 500 companies in the report's sample, 40 per cent said that productivity had increased as a result of diversity initiatives, while nearly the same proportion reported improved customer satisfaction and retention, a wider spread of customers in different markets and higher sales or market penetration. Even higher percentages claimed they were better able to attract talent and improve corporate image as an employer of choice. Forty-five per cent confirmed the most contentious claim - that diversity increases innovation. There are other important benefits. Many companies have made HR-related gains such as reduced recruitment costs (by addressing a larger talent pool), higher motivation and better staff retention. These, the report surmises, feed through into business-related gains as a knock-on effect and 'over time this sequence is expected to produce a number of benefits as a chain reaction', including a widening range of process and product improvements. The market carrot has undoubtedly been complemented by the compliance stick. Some companies admit they have been pushed into diversity initiatives because large customers, such as BT, or the public sector demanded it. An additional spur has been the rash of multimillion-dollar discrimination lawsuits brought against pillars of the US corporate establishment such as Texaco, Coca-Cola and even Wal-Mart. The Government's influence is particularly important, Rajan believes. One of the goals of the Civil Service reform programme is to improve delivery performance by making it more reflective of the overall community. But while it has made reasonable progress in promoting women - 25 per cent in the senior civil service - ethnic minorities last year formed just 3 per cent of senior ranks. Part of the obstacle is a lack of role models. To counter this, the service has instituted a leadership programme for minority ethnic staff with the potential to make it to the top, called 'Pathways'. This well illustrates why managing diversity isn't just a matter of promoting differ ent people into higher positions - and why progress is so patchy. Making diversity pay involves real and difficult choices. For instance, to attract more women, City and consultancy organisations are having to tone down testosterone- and long-hours'- dominated cultures and pay attention to unfamiliar concepts such as mentoring and work-life balance. The London Central Skills Council, which supported the report, is setting up a good practice network to help firms explore these issues. At the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development, which has long championed diversity initiatives, adviser Dianah Worman endorses many of the report's findings. 'Diversity's a no-brainer,' she says, 'but many companies still don't get it.' Those that do have understood that it has nothing to do with box-ticking or following formulas. 'The big business case is that the way an organisation behaves in future has to be different from the way it has behaved in the past,' she says. 'The exciting bit is when line managers get hold of it and realise that that's the issue, not something called \"diversity\" at all.' As with driving, you know you're doing diversity right when you've stopped thinking about the action and are concentrating on where you want to go. \u00b7 simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
