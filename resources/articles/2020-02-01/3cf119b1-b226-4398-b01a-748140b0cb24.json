Robert Peston concluded the event by asking people in the room to put their hands up if they were Labour supporters and then put their hands up if they actually voted Labour in the last election. Several hands went down. They were then asked if they would vote Labour in the next election following tonight\u2019s hustings and most of the hands shot back up. It was clear from the cheers and applause in the audience following each of Lisa Nandy\u2019s answers that she was the most popular candidate in the room. She has also received a lot of praise on Twitter. A member of the audience has asked whether the candidates would consider themselves to be Zionists. \u201cI believe in the state of Israel so therefore I am a Zionist,\u201d Emily Thornberry says. Keir Starmer says he believes in a two-state solution and says he supports and sympathises with zionists but wouldn\u2019t describe himself as one. Lisa Nandy says: \u201cI believe Jewish people have a right to national self-determination. That makes me a Zionist.\u201d She says she \u201chates the way the word has been weaponised\u201d and goes on to say she also believes in a two-state solution. Rebecca Long-Bailey is last to answer. \u201cI also agree with a secure Israel and I also agree with a two-state solution.\u201d She says she guesses it does make her a Zionist because she believes Israel should have self-determination. The candidates are talking about how they will stand up to Boris Johnson. Emily Thornberry says: \u201cThe idea that the Tory party is the party of the working man is nonsense\u201d. She says she is the one who can stand up to Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201ctosh\u201d because of all her experience at the despatch box. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have out myself forward for what is frankly the worst job in the world which is the Labour party leader in opposition,\u201d she says to laughs. The candidates have been asked about how to deal with the rise of populism. Lisa Nandy says the questioning of the Panorama whistleblowers was a typical populist tactic and there is populism at \u201cevery level of the Labour Party\u201d. \u201cThis is not something that infects the right alone. This is something that infects the left as well,\u201d she says. Rebecca Long-Bailey says Labour should apologise for how it reacted to the BBC\u2019s Panorama documentary about bullying and antisemitism. Asked whether Luciana Berger would be welcomed back into the Labour party, she says what happened to Berger was \u201cabsolutely shocking\u201d. \u201cWe need to recognise that and start to build bridges and rebuild trust,\u201d she says. Pressed as to whether Berger would be welcomed back, Nandy says she would. On the \u201cculture of bullying\u201d, Emily Thornberry says there needs to be a \u201croot and branch\u201d change at Labour headquarters. Lisa Nandy says she considered her position in the Labour party over antisemitism. She says you can stay in the cabinet and try privately to change things but if nothing changes still, you have to make a stand. Nandy, who seems to have the support of most in the room and has received several loud applauses, talks about being accused of disloyalty for speaking out about antisemitism. She says: \u201cWhat is more disloyal than not standing up for our Labour values?\u201d I\u2019m now watching the Jewish Labour Movement hustings. The candidates in the Labour leadership race are now answering questions from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. To recap, the ministers who lost their seats around the cabinet table today include: Sajid Javid resigned as chancellor. Julian Smith was sacked as Northern Ireland secretary. Andrea Leadsom was sacked as business secretary. Theresa Villiers lost her job as environment secretary. Geoffrey Cox was sacked as attorney general. Esther McVey lost her job as a housing minister attending cabinet. Here\u2019s a a visual representation of who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down: A few more positions have been filled. Zac Goldsmith will stay on as a minister for the environment and international development, but he will also be minister for the Foreign Office as well. Nigel Adams has also become a joint minister for the Foreign Office and international development, while Liz Sugg will continue in her role as a joint parliamentary under secretary at international development while also taking up the same position in the Foreign Office. Kit Malthouse will stay as a Home Office minister, and Conor Burns will remain an international trade minister. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, has responded to analysis by the Sutton Trusts which has found that 62% of the new cabinet attended independent schools. She said: \u201cIt is now clear that Boris Johnson is running a government of the few, by the few, for the few. It\u2019s no surprise that the Tories have failed to honour their pledge to rethink the tax loopholes that benefit private schools, and Johnson instead plans yet another giveaway for the super-rich instead. The next Labour government will invest in all schools, and provide a free healthy meal for all primary school pupils by ending the VAT tax break for private schools.\u201d Here\u2019s a breakdown of who makes up the cabinet. The Sutton Trust has analysed the education background of Boris Johnson\u2019s new cabinet. It has found that 62% attended independent schools, a very small decrease from Johnson\u2019s previous cabinet (64%) while 31% of the new cabinet went through a \u201cpipeline\u201d from fee-paying schools to Oxbridge. There has been a very slight increase in the proportion educated at comprehensives, from 27% in 2019, to 31% today. This proportion of alumni of independent schools is more than twice that of Theresa May\u2019s 2016 cabinet (30%), slightly more than Cameron\u2019s 2015 cabinet (50%) and the same as the 2010 coalition cabinet (62%). Sir Peter Lampl, the founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: December\u2019s election led to a seismic shift in the political landscape. The falling of the red wall means Conservative MPs now represent a much more diverse range of constituencies than before, with constituents from many different socio-economic backgrounds. \u201cYet in terms of educational background, the make-up of Johnson\u2019s cabinet is still over 60% from independent schools. Today\u2019s findings underline how unevenly spread the opportunities are to enter the elites and this is something Boris Johnson must address.\u201d Housing may have had 10 ministers in 10 years but higher education is doing even worse: Chris Skidmore\u2019s sacking means the sector will have had eight universities ministers in the six years since David Willetts left in 2014. Four of those appointments are two of the same people \u2013 Jo Johnson was replaced by Sam Gyimah in January 2018, with Skidmore replacing Gyimah that November. But Johnson was back as minister in July 2019 before resigning in September, to be replaced by Skidmore. For those keeping score, the sequence is: Willetts, Greg Clarke, Johnson, Gyimah, Skidmore, Johnson, Skidmore, and \u2026 a person not yet known. The last woman in the role was Margaret Hodge in 2003, and David Lammy was the last non-Oxbridge-educated holder in 2010 (although he did go to Soas and Harvard). James Brokenshire will return to government as a minister of state in the Home Office. Jeremy Quin has been made a minister of state in the Ministry of Defence, and Helen Whately has been made minister of state in the Department of Health and Social Care. Chloe Smith is promoted to minister of state in the Cabinet Office, and Robin Walker has been made a minister of state in the Northern Ireland office. The Liberal Democrats have described Suella Braverman as \u201cunfit to serve as attorney general\u201d, after Johnson appointed her to the post. Pointing to Braverman\u2019s past comments about the role of the courts and human rights, Daisy Cooper, the justice spokesperson for the Lib Dems described her appointment as \u201cthe latest shocking step in Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings\u2019 assault on the rule of law\u201d. Braverman recently argued that \u201cthe concept of \u2018fundamental\u2019 human rights has been stretched beyond recognition\u201d and that \u201cthe explosion of judicial review and judicial activism has led to a censoriousness and litigiousness in our society\u201d. Cooper said: \u201cLiberal Democrats will not allow this dangerous, authoritarian Conservative government to undermine the rule of law and erode individual rights and freedoms.\u201d Suella Braverman, who was appointed attorney general earlier in the day, has released a statement about her new role. She said: \u201cI am honoured to be appointed as attorney general for England and Wales and look forward to working with the many excellent government lawyers and officials. \u201cI want to thank my predecessor Geoffrey Cox QC MP for leaving me with such a strong record to build upon. \u201cOne of my first priorities is to continue the government\u2019s work in rebuilding confidence in our justice system, particularly with victims.\u201d Ten in ten years: that\u2019s the churn rate for housing ministers after Boris Johnson fired Esther McVey on Thursday. Starting with Grant Shapps in 2010, ministers to have solemnly promised to tackle the housing crisis before being promoted or sacked have included Mark Prisk, Kris Hopkins, Brandon Lewis, Gavin Barwell, Alok Sharma, Dominc Raab and Kit Malthouse. McVey lasted little more than six months. It wasn\u2019t much better under Labour, with Tony Blair and Gordon Brown appointing eight ministers in the noughties. And yet the state of housing in Britain is acknowledged across the political spectrum as one of the biggest social and economic challenges facing the country. \u201cA revolving door of housing ministers have not taken the time to get to grips with the long-term problems fuelling the housing emergency,\u201d said Polly Neate, the chief executive of the housing charity Shelter, which reckons it takes any minister months to even start to grasp the lattice of issues behind the crisis. How the planning system interacts with land values is dizzyingly complicated, rising homelessness and rough sleeping is politically explosive, and attempts to reform renting or home ownership quickly run into powerful vested interests. Successive governments have also missed house building targets. Theresa May\u2019s government pledged to built 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s, but the public accounts committee warned last summer that this was likely to be missed. On average, only 177,000 homes have been built annually in England in the period 2005-06 to 2017-18. \u201cThe ministerial merry-go-round isn\u2019t the root cause of the Tories\u2019 failure on housing, but it certainly doesn\u2019t help,\u201d said John Healey, the shadow housing secretary. The former chancellor Sajid Javid has used his resignation letter to urge the prime minister not to lose the \u201ccharacter and integrity\u201d of the Treasury. In the letter, which he released in full on Twitter, he urges Johnson to \u201censure the Treasury as an institution retains as much credibility as possible\u201d. Javid told the prime minister he believed it was \u201cimportant as leaders to have trusted teams that reflect the character and integrity that you would wish to be associated with\u201d. Downing Street has announced four more appointments, at a more junior level. Penny Mordaunt returns to government as paymaster general in the Cabinet Office. In the past the paymaster general has sometimes been a Treasury minister, but sometimes the post goes to someone based in the Cabinet Office, like the last one, Oliver Dowden. Mordaunt was defence secretary until last summer, but having back Jeremy Hunt for the leadership, she was sacked when Boris Johnson became PM. Christopher Pincher has been made minister of state at the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government. If this means he is the housing minister, he will be the 10th since 2010 - see 10.34am. He was a Foreign Office minister. Andrew Stephenson has been made a minister of state at transport. He was a Foreign Office minister. James Cleverly has been made a joint minister of state for the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development. He was Conservative chairman. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Nicola Slawson is taking over now. Amanda Milling has been made Conservative party chairman. She is also a member of the cabinet, as minister without portfolio. Previously deputy chief whip, she is a long-standing supporter of Boris Johnson\u2019s, helping in his leadership campaign in 2016. (In 2019 she was a whip, and so obliged to remain neutral.) Mark Spencer remains chief whip. And we\u2019ve just published a comment piece from Polly Toynbee on the reshuffle in which her take on Boris Johnson\u2019s job offer is, word for word, the same as Sajid Javid\u2019s. (See 5.11pm.) It\u2019s not often she and Javid agree, but she starts her column saying: No self-respecting chancellor would accept such terms: that was Sajid Javid\u2019s reason for resigning. So in Rishi Sunak we have an alarmingly obedient new chancellor ready to take the job on any terms. His advisers will be fused with those of No 10, his power base diminished, and his office under the control of Dominic Cummings, intimidator-in-chief. Sunak will struggle to shake off shadow chancellor John McDonnell\u2019s charge that he is nothing but \u201ca stooge\u201d. Here is another extract. The message of this reshuffle is a nasty and dangerous one: absolute power resides in just one place, No 10. The Treasury, which strove to protect the nation\u2019s finances against the worst damages of Brexit, is a diminished force \u2013 for now. Attempts to thwart Johnson\u2019s reckless plans \u2013 whether branded super-bridges or Brexit vanity projects \u2013 will be overridden. If Whitehall joked that Javid was \u201cchino\u201d \u2013 chancellor in name only \u2013 his successor can expect even less respect. And here is the full article. This is what Sajid Javid said about his resignation in a short clip for the BBC, broadcast just now. The questions are from the interviewer, Chris Mason. It\u2019s been a huge honour to serve as chancellor of the exchequer. Whilst I was very pleased that the prime minister wanted to reappoint me, I was unable to accept the conditions that he had attached, so I felt that I was left with no option other than to resign. Now, my successor has my full support and the prime minister continues to enjoy my full support, as does the government. Q: Did you regard yourself as chancellor in name only [Chino - a nicknamed coined by his detractors. See 12.56pm]? If so, was that because of the influence of Dominic Cummings? The conditions that were attached was a requirement that I replace all my political advisers. These are people who have worked incredibly hard on behalf of, not just the government, but the whole country, [and] done a fantastic job. I was unable to accept those conditions. I don\u2019t believe any self-respecting minister would accept such conditions. And so therefore I felt the best thing to do was to go. Q: Were those conditions imposed by Mr Cummings? Those were the conditions requested by the prime minister. That was, of course, his prerogative. And, as I say, my successor has my full support, as does the prime minister, and I will continue to support this government in every way I can from the backbenches. Sajid Javid has spoken to the BBC. He said he could not accept the conditions attached to the offer for him to stay in post. But he said Rishi Sunak had his full support. I\u2019ll post the full quotes in a moment. The Downing Street lobby briefing is over. Here are some of the key points. No 10 was unable to confirm that the budget would go ahead as planned on 11 March. If the budget is delayed, it will be the second time this has happened. During the general election campaign the Conservative party put out a press release saying that during the 100 days of a new government Boris Johnson would be \u201cdelivering a post-Brexit budget in February which will cut taxes for hardworking families\u201d. That plan was shelved, and the budget was scheduled for March. The Telegraph\u2019s Anna Mikhailova says the budget cannot be delayed much longer. Downing Street has confirmed that special advisers working for No 10 and the Treasury will be pooled. No 10 refused to confirm that Sajid Javid\u2019s fiscal rules would be maintained. Downing Street refused to give any more details about who paid for the PM\u2019s winter holiday. As my colleague Rajeev Syal reports, Labour is demanding an inquiry because Johnson is not saying clearly who did pay for the holiday. Andrew Murrison, who has been a joint Foreign Office/Department for International Development minister, has announced that he is leaving the government. His tweet suggests he has been sacked, although he does not say so explicitly. And Jacob Rees-Mogg is staying as leader of the Commons, No 10 has confirmed. As explained earlier (see 11.48am), his fate had been in the balance. Stephen Barclay, who was Brexit secretary until his job was abolished at 11pm on 31 January, has returned to the cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury. And Simon Hart remains as Welsh secretary. Brandon Lewis, the security minister, has become Northern Ireland secretary. Technically that is a promotion \u2013 as security minister, Lewis attended cabinet, but was not a full member \u2013 but, as reported earlier (see 11.28am), Lewis is not a No 10 favourite and this move might be seen as a means of sidelining him. Alister Jack is staying as Scottish secretary. Ben Wallace remains as defence secretary. He is a longstanding Boris Johnson supporter. He started backing Johnson as a future PM when Johnson was still mayor of London, but recently there have been reports claiming that he could be sacked for being too outspoken. In an interview in the Sunday Times last month (paywall) he said he was worried about the US abandoning its allies. Tim Shipman wrote: In an interview with the Sunday Times, Ben Wallace admitted that the prospect of America withdrawing from the world \u201ckeeps me awake at night\u201d. He said the government needed to rethink military assumptions, in place since 2010, that the UK would always be fighting alongside the Americans \u2013 and should use the upcoming defence review to buy new kit to ensure that the armed forces do not have to rely on US air cover and spy planes in future conflicts. \u201cI worry if the United States withdraws from its leadership around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be bad for the world and bad for us. We plan for the worst and hope for the best.\u201d Wallace\u2019s analysis of the potential threat posed by Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy may have been accurate, but No 10 took the view that it was not helpful for him to say this in public. Here is Tom Kibasi\u2019s take on the reshuffle for the Guardian. And here is an extract. The reality, however, is that [Rishi] Sunak is now merely [Dominic] Cummings\u2019 deputy. With the most powerful economic policymaker now an unelected adviser, this could be the turning point for both economic strategy and for the long-fabled power of the Treasury. Unlike many in the Tory party, Cummings has no fetish for eliminating the deficit. He is not bound by the ideological straitjacket of Treasury thinking. And he cannot be criticised for lacking vision. The government now talks of nationalisation, significant increases in public investment in research and development and infrastructure, and the introduction of wealth taxes. Margaret Thatcher famously described Tony Blair as her greatest legacy. If this new \u201cnational conservative\u201d agenda succeeds, perhaps in time John McDonnell will say the same of Cummings. Grant Shapps is staying as transport secretary, No 10 has announced. In the House of Commons, the government whip Stuart Andrew is winding up the general debate taking place before the half-term adjournment. As the Press Association\u2019s Richard Wheeler reports, he used a prop to make a reshuffle joke. Here are two snippets about the new environment secretary, George Eustice. The answer is almost certainly yes. Eustice was a Ukip candidate in the 1999 European elections. These are from the journalist Ian Birrell, who has a profoundly disabled daughter. The Labour MP Yvette Cooper has paid this tribute to Sajid Javid. George Eustice, the farming minister, has been promoted to the post of environment secretary. Robert Jenrick is staying as housing secretary. Sky\u2019s Ed Conway and Prospect\u2019s Tom Clark have both posted very good Twitter threads about Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation. Conway\u2019s starts here. And here is one of his conclusions. Clark\u2019s start here. And here is one of his conclusions. This is from Nick Macpherson, a former head of the Treasury. Gavin Williamson is staying as education secretary. Suella Braverman may have been auditioning for her new role as attorney general when she asked this question at PMQs last week. The terrorist incident last week reminds us that the rule of law remains a fundamental foundation of our democratic constitution, but the explosion of judicial review and judicial activism has led to a censoriousness and litigiousness in our society and has distorted questions that ought to remain exclusively political. How will my right honourable friend ensure that parliament remains the sovereign and legitimate source of law as we take back control? The Daily Mail\u2019s John Stevens has been looking at some past tweets from Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the new international development secretary. Here is John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, on Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation. And Suella Braverman has been promoted to attorney general. A prominent Brexiter, Braverman served as a Brexit minister in 2018 before she resigned over Theresa May\u2019s deal. She is also a former chair of the European Research Group, which represents the most hardline Tory Brexiters. Braverman was a barrister before she became an MP but, unlike most people who have been appointed to this office in the past, she was a relatively junior one, not a QC. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey is staying as work and pensions secretary, and Lady Evans is staying as leader of the Lords. Evans was not expected to move, but there was some doubt about whether Coffey would be retained. David Gauke, the former justice secretary and former Treasury minister, told Radio 5 live\u2019s Emma Barnett that he thought Rishi Sunak would turn out to have more authority as chancellor than some people are predicting. Gauke explained: Having lost one chancellor, to lose another chancellor would be incredibly difficult, so Rishi Sunak is actually in quite a strong position now, and although there will be a lot of talk about him being Boris Johnson\u2019s placeman, if he wants to assert himself you could argue that he is pretty well unsackable. If I was Rishi I would be pretty determined to show that I was not a stooge, and demonstrate some independence pretty early on especially in his budget. Partly just for the credibility and economic policy for this country, in terms of the international markets, a chancellor who is seen as a stooge will face real difficulties. You go back to the history of Margaret Thatcher after Nigel Lawson resigned and John Major came in, John Major who at the time was seen as being a bit of a stooge, but was in a much more powerful position because Margaret Thatcher realised she couldn\u2019t afford to lose a second chancellor of the exchequer. In a snap take on the reshuffle for the Financial Times (paywall), Robert Shrimsley says the loss of Sajid Javid will be damaging for the government. Here\u2019s an extract. There was simply no need for Boris Johnson to lose his chancellor of the exchequer. The fact that he has done so shows that the prime minister intends to brook no dissent and that No 10 is determined to keep control of financial policy. Sajid Javid quit rather than be told he had to sack his aides and submit to Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson\u2019s chief strategist, taking control of financial policy via a joint team of advisers. At that point most prime ministers would have concluded that this was not a big enough issue over which to lose an already compliant chancellor. Mr Johnson decided otherwise. It is an astonishing decision; a chaotic, unnecessary and damaging outcome for the government ... No sensible premier loses his chancellor by accident and while a politically weak neighbour seems attractive to a prime minister, there will be a cost. Good government often depends on senior ministers \u2013 and the chancellor in particular \u2013 being able to fight bad ideas. Mr Johnson\u2019s cabinet has just seen the price of defiance. Oliver Dowden has been promoted from a minister in the Cabinet Office to culture secretary. Liz Truss remains as international trade secretary. Truss is now the longest continuing serving member of the cabinet (judged by attendees, not full members). She joined in 2014 as environment secretary, and has also been justice secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury (where she just had attendee status). Michael Gove first joined the cabinet in 2010, but he had a career break when Theresa May sacked him. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg These are from the Independent\u2019s Ben Chu. And Anne-Marie Trevelyan has been promoted from defence minister to international development secretary. Matt Hancock is staying as health secretary. The New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush has written a very interesting blogpost on the possible long-term consequences of Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation. \u201cIt is, in terms of the governance of the United Kingdom, probably the most significant development since the creation of the devolved parliaments in 1999,\u201d he says. Do read the whole thing, but here\u2019s an extract. Rishi Sunak, Javid\u2019s replacement, is reported to have accepted the merger of staff across numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street. It\u2019s an illustration of British politics\u2019 \u201cunipolar moment\u201d: as I wrote last week, Boris Johnson is more powerful now than any British prime minister. He is using his position to concentrate power within Downing Street in a way we have not seen before ... How will it work out? From a political perspective, the Conservatives will surely benefit from what will be an unprecedented degree of alignment and coherence between the head of government and the government\u2019s finance chief. But from a policy perspective, the consequences are unknowable. This is a structure that, had it been in Tony Blair\u2019s hands in 1997, might have seen the United Kingdom join the euro. Sam McBride, the political editor of the News Letter in Belfast, has a good take on the achievements of Julian Smith as Northern Ireland secretary. He has posted a link to it here. From the Independent\u2019s Tom Peck Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation as chancellor of the exchequer leaves his successor, Rishi Sunak, with little more than three weeks to pull together a budget that Boris Johnson has promised will bring a new dawn of spending to \u201clevel up\u201d the regions and nations of the UK. The budget was also expected to fortify the economy before the start of new trading arrangements with the EU next year. Sunak, who was part of the 2015 intake to the Commons, joined the Treasury ministerial team last summer after 18 months as a housing minister. Despite his short tenure in Whitehall\u2019s most powerful ministry, the privately educated, Cambridge graduate will be familiar with the issues Javid was dealing with in his negotiations with Dominic Cummings and No 10. Cummings wants a spending spree to be directed by No 10, with large sums for the science budget and a wide array of infrastructure projects, not just the HS2 rail one. Last week No 10 let it be known that the PM\u2019s top aide was working \u201cpretty much full time\u201d on what should be included in the budget and what should be targeted in the government spending review. Taxes on the \u201cidle rich\u201d, a particular target of Cummings, will also need to be modelled by the Treasury to test its possible impact. A mansion tax has been floated by No 10. Cummings is also an enthusiastic supporter of raising national insurance towards the income tax threshold of \u00a312,500 to put more money in the pockets of poor and middle-income families. A more radical policy to limit tax relief on pension saving, which previous chancellors have considered and always resisted after it became clear it would provoke huge resistance, not least from better-off Tory voters, could also get the green light. Javid resisted moving quickly to increase spending and cut taxes after it became clear that taxes on the higher paid would only offset some of the cost and force him to blow out his borrowing limits. From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the Independent\u2019s Ashley Cowburn Matt Hancock worked for the Bank of England before he became an MP and, being unusually ambitious even by Westminster standards, he would have loved to have been appointed chancellor. If you have got a spare half an hour and you\u2019re interested in Rishi Sunak, this is well worth listening to \u2013 his recent interview with the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson for the Political Thinking podcast. Among other attributes, Sunak is an obsessive Star Wars fan, and he performed very well in Robinson\u2019s Star Wars quiz. From the Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner Over recent weeks there have been several stories about how Sajid Javid has been at loggerheads with Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser. One of the most thorough accounts of their feuding was this one, from Alex Wickham at BuzzFeed. Here is an extract. Javid\u2019s allies have complained that Johnson\u2019s advisers were responsible for \u201cpoison pen\u201d briefings to the newspapers criticising the chancellor, as No 10 aides blasted Treasury officials for unauthorised briefings against them. A longtime friend said Javid\u2019s relationship with Cummings had broken down \u201cirrevocably\u201d. Ministers worried about losing their jobs during the reshuffle have been holding \u201cnew pizza club\u201d meetings to discuss how to combat the \u201ccontrol freakery\u201d of Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff. Even some of Cummings\u2019 closest allies have started to question his decisions, in the first sign of dissent among the Vote Leave faction of advisers. No 10 aides have lost internal arguments on a range of decisions from High Speed 2 to knocking down walls inside Downing Street. The Financial Times (paywall) also published a lengthy account of Javid/Cummings relations. In their story George Parker and Sebastian Payne revealed that Javid\u2019s No 10 enemies had a nickname for him. Boris Johnson\u2019s allies have a nickname for Sajid Javid: \u201cChino\u201d, or \u201cchancellor in name only\u201d. As tensions rise ahead of Mr Javid\u2019s budget on March 11, the emphasis is now placed on the last syllable: \u201cHe\u2019s always saying no,\u201d said one Tory official ... Some Tory MPs say some members of the No 10 political team are \u201creally horrible about Sajid \u2013 they see him as a block\u201d. The chancellor, for his part, sees his role as balancing the books on day-to-day spending as well as \u201clevelling up\u201d the country. On Monday, the Financial Times reported how Britain\u2019s public finances face a \u00a312bn deficit by 2022-23 because of lower Bank of England growth forecasts ... Last week it was reported that Mr Javid had decided to support Mr Johnson in backing the HS2 rail line, a project described by Mr Cummings as \u201ca disaster zone\u201d, in effect guaranteeing it would go ahead. Unnamed sources deplored the briefing, which they claimed came from the Treasury. \u201cThis sort of thing became commonplace under Theresa May,\u201d said one. \u201cWe have the authority and the majority to ensure this sort of thing does not go on any longer.\u201d Some Tories think the hostile No 10 briefings \u2013 notably the ones suggesting Mr Johnson prefers the advice of Rishi Sunak, Treasury chief secretary, to the advice of the chancellor \u2013 are intended to cow Mr Javid into submission. And in the Evening Standard, Jim Armitage said the decision to appoint Andrew Bailey as the next governor of the Bank of England was a victory for Javid over Cummings, who wanted Andrew Haldane to get the job. Alok Sharma has been promoted from international development secretary to business secretary. He will also be in charge of the Cop26 climate change conference. Robert Buckland is staying as justice secretary, as we expected. From the Times\u2019 political editor, Francis Elliott No 10 has confirmed Rishi Sunak\u2019s appointment as chancellor. Sunak\u2019s rise up the ranks has been extraordinary. He has been chief secretary to the Treasury since last summer, but technically he was not even a member of the cabinet; he was just a minister with the right to attend. Being chancellor is his first full cabinet job. Downing Street has now started tweeting about the reshuffle, starting with confirmation that Dominic Raab, Michael Gove and Priti Patel are all staying in post. It is not clear yet whether Gove will get any additional responsibilities as part of Cabinet Office portfolio. Westminster has not seen such an unexpected resignation from the Treasury since Nigel Lawson walked out of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s cabinet in 1989. Here is the Guardian report of that resignation (which includes a byline from a certain Chris Huhne, who was working here at the time). In some ways the Javid resignation is similar. Both chancellors quit because of rows about advisers. Nigel Lawson quit because Thatcher refused to get rid of Sir Alan Walters as her personal economic adviser. Javid has walked out because Johnson was refusing to let him keep is own team of advisers. But at the heart of the Lawson/Walters row was a bitter disagreement about monetary policy (Lawson favoured the exchange rate mechanism, Walters didn\u2019t). None of Javid\u2019s advisers have the policy stature of Walters, and if there are disagreements about policy, it is not clear what they were. There will be suspicions that the Javid/Johnson row is more about pique, with Javid refusing to cede influence to Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser. The Lawson resignation also came after Thatcher had been in office for more than 10 years, and it seen as one of the events that contributed to her downfall. Javid\u2019s resignation comes at a very different point in the arc of Johnson\u2019s premiership, and its long-term impact is likely to be much less significant. A source close to Sajid Javid has confirmed that he has resigned. The source told the Press Association. [Javid] has turned down the job of chancellor of the exchequer. The prime minister said he had to fire all his special advisers and replace them with Number 10 special advisers to make it one team. The chancellor said no self-respecting minister would accept those terms. Sajid Javid now joins the long list of people who have been let down by Boris Johnson. During the general election, in a Q&amp;A after a speech to the CBI, Johnson committed to keeping Javid as his chancellor after the election. Javid was doing an excellent job, he said. No other cabinet minister received a job security guarantee of this kind during the campaign. According to Sky News, Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is expected to be appointed chancellor. And there will be a joint pool of advisers serving No 10 and No 11, Sky reports. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, reportedly resigned because the PM insisted that he sack his advisers, and replace them with officials chosen by Number 10. Such a move would amount to a repeat of what happened last year, when one of Javid\u2019s advisers was sacked without his approval by Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser. Here is our story from the time. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, is taking questions on next week\u2019s Commons business. After he gave an interview at the start of the general election campaign saying the Grenfell Tower victims lacked the common sense to evacuate the building, it looked as though his career in cabinet might be over just as it was getting started. (Boris Johnson promoted him from the backbenches straight into the cabinet in the summer, when he became PM.) During the campaign Rees-Mogg was effectively banned from the airwaves by CCHQ, and there was speculation he would go in the reshuffle. But, as the Observer\u2019s Michael Savage suggests, Johnson may have decided that sacking Rees-Mogg could cause more trouble than it was worth. From the journalist Michael Crick, commenting on the departure of Chris Skidmore (see 9.37am) Here is Alok Sharma, the international development secretary, arriving at No 10 a few minutes ago. Government sources were briefing last night that he is getting a promotion. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM), has paid lavish tribute to Julian Smith, who was sacked this morning as Northern Ireland secretary, describing him as \u201cone of Britain\u2019s finest politicians of our time\u201d. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg Brandon Lewis is currently security minister. But Tory sources were hinting earlier this week that he would be penalised because of his decision, when he was Conservative chairman, to hold an investigation into Johnson\u2019s comment about women in Islamic dress looking like \u201cletterboxes\u201d (an inquiry that saw him subsequently cleared of being Islamophobic). It has also been claimed that he fell out with Carrie Symonds, the PM\u2019s partner, when he was chairman and she was head of the press office at CCHQ. It is not unusual for prime minister\u2019s to treat the Northern Ireland Office as a ministerial version of the doghouse - somewhere to send people deemed out of favour. But, for obvious reasons, treating the post in this manner infuriates politicians from all parties at Stormont. George Freeman has confirmed that he has been sacked as transport minister. Sky\u2019s Tamara Cohen claims that Julian Smith was sacked partly for saying last year that a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cvery, very bad\u201d for Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland at the time Smith\u2019s comment was not seen as a gaffe, but as a statement of the obvious. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has just gone into No 10. Here is Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, on the sacking of Julian Smith. And here is an extract from an article by Gerry Moriary, the Irish Times\u2019 northern editor, on Smith\u2019s departure. Not only was he viewed as pivotal in achieving the deal to restore the northern executive and assembly but he was seen as the first secretary of state in several years who adopted a proactive and muscular attitude in getting things done. This included ensuring that the victims of historical institutional abuse would get the compensation that they had been left waiting for because of the previous political paralysis. And here is the Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner on the reshuffle. Here is the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn on a theme of the reshuffle. Newton Dunn has also been applying some textual analysis to the Geoffrey Cox resignation letter. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has just gone into No 10. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, went in earlier. Both are expected to keep their jobs, and so it is not entirely clear why they are being called in. Maybe No 10 has just choreographed the meetings to provide some footage for the broadcasters. Here is Raab arriving at the Foreign Office earlier - without a tie. He smartened up later for his visit to No 10. Geoffrey Cox has posted his resignation letter on Twitter. \u201cLeaving the government at the PM\u2019s request\u201d is a polite way of confirming that he has been sacked. As Gavin Freeguard points out at the Institute for Government\u2019s reshuffle live blog (a bit like this, but with fewer jokes, and more graphs), Esther McVey\u2019s sacking means that we will now be onto our 10th housing minister since 2010. As the Institute for Government explained in a recent report, rapid ministerial turnover is a problem for British government. The average cabinet minster gets moved every two years, almost as often as the average football manager. Other countries leave ministers in post for longer, which increases the chances that they a) might actually learn something about the problems they are addressing and b) stay long enough to see through any changes. Nusrat Ghani is leaving her post as transport minister. Her tweet implies she has been sacked, although she does not say that explicitly and sometimes ministers do leave government voluntarily. She had been tipped as the new minister for HS2, the post that Boris Johnson pledged to create on Tuesday. Theresa Villiers has used a post on Facebook to confirm that she has been sacked as environment secretary. It is quite lengthy, focusing on what she sees as her achievements in that post. Here is an excerpt. What the prime minister giveth, the prime minister taketh away: just over six months ago, I was delighted to be invited by the prime minister to return to government after three years on the backbenches. This morning he told me that I need to make way for someone new. I am deeply grateful for having been given the opportunity to serve twice at the highest level of government, first as Northern Ireland secretary and then as secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs. I tackled both roles with passion, commitment, and huge amounts of hard work ... Whether it is in the cabinet, in parliament, or in any other walk of life, if there is one thing we should all strive for, it is to safeguard our natural environment for future generations. From the backbenches, I shall continue to campaign to protect nature and address disastrous climate change, as well as fighting hard on all the other crucial issues which matter to my constituents in Chipping Barnet ... I wish the prime minister and his new cabinet well in the tasks ahead of them. I am sad to no longer be part of that team, but they will have my full support as they take forward Boris\u2019 bold agenda to unite and level up every part of this great country. Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s foreign minister and deputy PM, has paid tribute to Julian Smith. Attorney general\u2019s questions has just started in the Commons. Michael Ellis, the solicitor general, is taking questions. There is no sign of Geoffrey Cox. The Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn says Geoffrey Cox definitely was sacked as attorney general this morning. Even without an attorney general, attorney general question\u2019s can still go ahead. Michael Ellis, the solicitor general, may just take all the questions. From the Telegraph\u2019s Camilla Tominey Here is the full statement that Colum Eastwood, the SDLP leader, has released about the sacking of Julian Smith. Eastwood said: It defies belief that after the successful restoration of power sharing following a three-year collapse, Julian Smith\u2019s reward is a cabinet office P45. It tells you all you need to know about Boris Johnson\u2019s attitude to the north that he would sack the most successful secretary of state in a decade. He is at best indifferent. I want to place on record my sincere thanks to Julian for the work he\u2019s done over the last few months. His change in approach was central to breaking the logjam at Stormont. I found him to be a secretary of state genuinely committed to acting in the interests of devolution rather than imposing a cabinet agenda on this place. And I remain grateful for the work he undertook with me to secure additional resource for university expansion in Derry. The next secretary of state must be committed to the substance of Julian Smith\u2019s commitments to the north and should learn a lot from his style of engagement. One staffer at the Northern Ireland Office in Belfast said colleagues had been crossing fingers - literally - for Smith to be kept on as secretary of state, saying he was the most engaged, competent boss they had had in a long time, I\u2019m told. And Andrea Leadsom has confirmed that she has lost her post as business secretary. Leadsom had also served as environment secretary and leader of the Commons under Theresa May. Like Esther McVey, she also resigned from May\u2019s cabinet over Brexit. Leadsom and McVey were both high-profile Brexiters, alarmed by the compromises May was making. Esther McVey has confirmed that she has been sacked as housing minister. She was not a full cabinet minister in that role, but she did attend cabinet. Previously, before she resigned over Brexit in November 2018, she was work and pensions secretary. It looks as though Boris Johnson may have finished the cabinet sackings phase of this reshuffle. If he is heading back to No 10 from his office in the Commons, that means he has finished the face-to-face meetings with ministers who are getting the chop. As explained earlier (see 8.50am), the venue for the \u2018good news\u2019 job interviews is Downing Street. And here are two alternative views on the Julian Smith sacking. From Christopher Montgomery, a former DUP chief of staff From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the BBC\u2019s political editor Laura Kuenssberg Here is some reaction to Julian Smith\u2019s sacking from Northern Ireland politicians. From Colum Eastwood MP, the SDLP leader From Christopher Stalford, a DUP member of the Northern Ireland assembly Here is some comment on Julian Smith\u2019s sacking as Northern Ireland secretary from Ireland specialists. From the BBC\u2019s Jayne McCormack From Sky\u2019s David Blevins From Sky\u2019s Stephen Murphy From OpenDemocracy\u2019s Peter Geoghegan And this is from Peter Foster, the Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor. He posted it before Smith\u2019s sacking was confirmed, but it still applies. Chris Skidmore, the universities minister, is leaving his post, he has announced. He has just posted this on Twitter, which implies he will be out of government. But it is not clear from this whether he has been sacked, or whether he has decided to quit voluntarily. From my colleague Kate Proctor Esther McVey, the housing minister, is going in to see the PM, the Sun\u2019s Matt Dathan reports. Julian Smith has confirmed that he has been sacked as Northern Ireland secretary. Only this morning Smith made it clear that leaving was not his choice. (See 9am.) Geoffrey Cox has refused to comment on what happened when he met the PM, reports the Telegraph\u2019s Camilla Tominey. That sounds like confirmation he has been sacked. If Cox is sounding chipper, that may be because he is looking forward to resuming work as a QC. He was the best-paid MP in parliament before he entered government, because of all the legal work he managed to combine with his Commons duties, and although he enjoyed being a minister, it does not seem to have been a lifelong ambition. He was a backbencher for 13 years before Theresa May\u2019s surprise decision to make him attorney general in 2018, partly because she needed a Brexiter in that role. UPDATE: I\u2019ve amended the post above because it said Cox was made attorney general after he made the speech introducing May at the Tory conference in 2018. But he had already been appointed at that point. Geoffrey Cox seems to have just finished a meeting with the PM, the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford reports. We assume Cox is no longer attorney general. Theresa Villiers, the environment secretary, has just gone in to see the PM, Sky\u2019s Joe Pike reports. From the BBC\u2019s Ross Hawkins Yesterday, speaking at an Institute for Government event, Geoffrey Cox said he would like to stay as attorney general. But he adopted the tone of someone who was not assuming that he would remain in his job, and managed what might have been a valedictory swipe at Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser. Cox may assume that Cummings has been briefing against him. A government source told the Daily Mail recently that Cox was \u201cnot a team player\u201d. The source went on: It\u2019s all very well being able to recite Keats but the government needs to come together if we\u2019re going to deliver on this election. Cox is a serious lover of poetry, and can recite large chunks of verse from memory. From the BBC\u2019s Gareth Gordon And this is from a bit earlier. Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, was not in a mood to talk when she arrived at the Commons, it seems. From Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti This is from the BBC\u2019s Jayne McCormack, quoting the Ulster Unionist Northern Ireland assembly member Doug Beattie on Julian Smith. (See 8.35am.) This chart, from the blogger Peter Donaghy, probably won\u2019t be much consolation to Smith if he does get sacked. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has also been seen arriving at the Commons \u2013 but he has to be here anyway, because he has business questions. It is unusual to hold a reshuffle on a Thursday, when the Commons starts sitting at 9.30am and government ministers are scheduled to take questions. That means this morning MPs are expecting to hear from culture ministers at 9.30am (although not the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, who sits in the House of Lords, and is standing down at this reshuffle), the attorney general at 10.10am (Geoffrey Cox, as of now, although he is expected to be sacked) and Rees-Mogg at 10.30am, when he takes questions on the Commons business statement. Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, has arrived at the Commons, the Telegraph\u2019s Camilla Tominey reports. There is speculation that she will be replaced by the international development secretary Alok Sharma, who will definitely get a promotion, government sources were saying last night. In the Times (paywall) this morning Francis Elliott and Steven Swinford have more on why Julian Smith may be sacked as Northern Ireland secretary. They report: The Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith was fighting for his future last night as he looked poised to be one of the biggest casualties of Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet reshuffle. He had been considered safe after securing a power-sharing deal at Stormont. However, Mr Johnson was said to have felt \u201cblindsided\u201d by the deal, which includes an investigation into alleged crimes by British soldiers in the Troubles. \u201cThere is concern about the way he\u2019s been operating,\u201d a senior government source said. The Times understands that the cabinet was fully briefed on the deal before it was agreed, including on aspects concerning historic investigations. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. We were told that Boris Johnson was going to start the reshuffle at 8am, with cabinet sackings. Prime ministers often like to hold these meetings in their office in the House of Commons because it means ministers can come and go (as ex-ministers) without having to suffer the Downing Street \u201cwalk of shame\u201d. The public cannot access the area of the Commons where cabinet ministers have their offices, and even lobby journalists based in the building are not meant to lurk in the corridor outside. The promotions will come later, with ministers invited to meet Johnson in No 10. Downing Street often announces appointments as they happen. But it does not announce sackings as they happen. We learn about those either when the ministers involved tell someone, or when the final cabinet list gets published at the end of the day. And it looks as if Johnson is now in his Commons office. The Times\u2019 sketchwriter Quentin Letts saw his convoy arrive at parliament a few minutes ago. Meanwhile, Johnson is being urged to \u201cfess up\u201d over who paid for his \u00a315,000 luxury Caribbean holiday after a scoop in the Daily Mail that a Tory donor denied funding the trip. Here\u2019s PA Media\u2019s follow-up: Labour has warned the prime minister that he must announce who stumped up the money for the getaway or else face a parliamentary investigation. The PM and girlfriend Carrie Symonds accepted accommodation for a private holiday in St Vincent and the Grenadines as a post-election victory escape. Johnson\u2019s entry in the Commons\u2019 register of members\u2019 interests recorded that the trip was paid for by Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross. But multi-millionaire businessman Ross told the Daily Mail he helped put the Conservative party leader in touch with companies providing accommodation, but denied fronting up the money or the villa. Labour has called for the PM to provide answers over the trip or else face a parliamentary inquiry. \u201cBoris Johnson must come clean about who has paid for his luxury trip,\u201d said Jon Trickett, the party\u2019s shadow cabinet office minister. In a declaration published on Wednesday, Johnson announced in the MPs\u2019 register that he had accepted \u201caccommodation for a private holiday for my partner and me, value 15,000\u201d. The private holiday lasted from 26 December to 5 January, according to the entry in the register, and names Mr Ross as the financial provider. But Ross told the Mail the former London mayor had asked him for help finding accommodation on the island Mustique, where he and his girlfriend reportedly stayed, but that he had not provided the villa. A spokesman for the Grimsby-born businessman, reportedly worth more than \u00a3650m, told the newspaper: \u201cBoris Johnson did not stay in David Ross\u2019s house. \u201cBoris wanted some help to find somewhere in Mustique, David called the company who run all the villas and somebody had dropped out. \u201cSo Boris got the use of a villa that was worth \u00a315,000, but David Ross did not pay any monies whatsoever for this.\u201d The Guardian report is here: Politico\u2019s Jack Blanchard provides a handy a reshuffle timetable: A succession of brutal ministerial sackings will begin in the PM\u2019s parliamentary office at 8am as Johnson looks to clear out the \u201cdead wood\u201d (h/t a No. 10 official) and refresh his top team. Once the messy part is out of the way, Johnson will turn his attention to the jollier business of handing out jobs to his favourite MPs. Expect to see a succession of rising stars proceeding down Downing Street with beaming smiles from about 10am. The new cabinet should be in place soon after lunchtime, at which point Johnson will turn his attention to reshuffling the junior ranks. It\u2019s going to be a hell of a day. And an even more helpful summary of what he is expecting (note the use of the words \u2018likely\u2019, \u2018probably\u2019 and \u2018in the balance\u2019): Nicky Morgan is definitely out at DCMS, with Oliver Dowden tipped to replace her. Alok Sharma is definitely promoted from DfID, with Anne-Marie Trevelyan tipped to replace him. Geoffrey Cox is almost definitely out as attorney general, with Lucy Frazer tipped to replace him. Theresa Villiers is very likely out at DEFRA, with Steve Barclay, George Eustice and Mark Spencer among those tipped to replace her. Andrea Leadsom is very likely out at BEIS, with Alok Sharma tipped to replace her. Julian Smith is seemingly in the balance at the Northern Ireland Office following this morning\u2019s reports in the Times. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey is also in the balance, but probably staying at DWP. Ben Wallace is probably staying at the MoD, despite heavy briefing against him. Jacob Rees-Mogg is probably staying as leader of the Commons, after going into hiding since November. Mark Spencer is very likely staying as chief whip, though has been angling for the environment job of late. Liz Truss is almost definitely staying in the Cabinet, although it\u2019s unclear if she remains at DIT. The high-profile Eurosceptic MP Steve Baker, who last year rejected a job on Johnson\u2019s frontbench but has since signalled that he would like to be trade secretary, has posted a cryptic tweet featuring a video of a squirrel slipping on a greasy pole. When Benjamin Disraeli became prime minister in 1868 he said: \u201cI have climbed to the top of the greasy pole.\u201d The BBC\u2019s Chris Mason reminds us of the diversity makeup of Johnson\u2019s current cabinet compared with Theresa May\u2019s last cabinet. Welcome to a slightly earlier politics live blog to cover the buildup to the reshuffle. Boris Johnson has shied away from a major overall of his top team and a rationalisation of Whitehall as championed by his key adviser Dominic Cummings. Instead the reshuffle will be \u201cpromote a generation of talent\u201d aimed at preparing the Tories for the future. Those whose jobs are widely believed to be under threat include the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, the environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, and the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox. But Sajid Javid, who has clashed with Cummings, appears safe, with Rishi Sunak also left in place as chief secretary of the Treasury. It is in the lower ranks of the government where the biggest changes are expected as the prime minister seeks to bring in more female MPs to ministerial roles. Johnson wants to give experience to a range of women who could be promoted to the cabinet in future reshuffles. Female MPs in line for promotion include defence minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan, former Brexit minister Suella Braverman and Gillian Keegan. Alok Sharma is expected to be promoted from his current cabinet post at international development, while the paymaster general Oliver Dowden \u2013 who attends cabinet \u2013 is also in line for a bigger job. A No 10 source said: The prime minister wants this reshuffle to set the foundations for government now and in the future. \u201cHe wants to promote a generation of talent that will be promoted further in the coming years. \u201cHe will reward those MPs who have worked hard to deliver on this government\u2019s priorities to level up the whole country and deliver the change people voted for last year. Senior ministers including the chancellor, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, Priti Patel, and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, are expected to remain in place while Downing Street has confirmed that Grant Shapps will stay on as transport secretary. The reshuffle is expect to begin at around 8am, by which time Andrew Sparrow will be here with all the details."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
