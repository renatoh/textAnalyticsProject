They are set to launch the first national register of nannies - who would undergo police checks and vetting similar to those for supply teachers. Although the register would be voluntary, Ministers argue parents would quickly learn to be suspicious of any unregistered nanny. The Department for Education and Skills is also expected to tighten the rules on people working with children through after-school clubs, one of the fastest-growing forms of childcare. Currently there are no obliga tions on carers working with children over eight to be registered or vetted, a loophole now likely to be closed. The move to register nannies follows talks between the Early Years Minister, Baroness Ashton, and Libby and Ken Osborne, whose baby son Joshua was shaken to death by his childminder, Linda Bayfield, last year. Although - unlike nannies - childminders are registered, the Osbornes have since campaigned to close loopholes in the system. It could also pave the way for working mothers to get tax breaks on their nannies, although families with full-time nannies are unlikely to benefit. However, it would open the door to new 'nanny circles', where a group of neighbourhood mothers share a nanny."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
