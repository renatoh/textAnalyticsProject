A tradition stretching from Fanny Hill to The World of Suzie Wong to the more recent Belle de Jour, Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl and the forthcoming Girl With a One Track Mind, the sexually explicit diary or hooker's-blog-turned-publishing-sensation no longer possesses the power to shock. In its packaging, its title, subject matter and timing, In My Skin is thus thoroughly tainted by association. The book itself, however, is quite simply in a class of its own. In My Skin is the work of a stunningly talented writer who both graces and surpasses her material, subverting popular assumptions about addiction and prostitution while making the extraordinary seem commonplace and the ordinary deeply alluring. The subject matter, fascinating though it is, is secondary. Such are her powers to tap into the universal while telling a cracking good tale, Kate Holden could make the story of a tongue-tied troglodyte thrilling. A middle-class girl from a loving Melbourne family, Holden experienced the standard outsider complex of the quiet bookworm, but spent a happy childhood in suburbia with consistently supportive parents and one younger sister. Her depiction of her comforting, gently bohemian upbringing \"full of cracked treasures, odd objects in boxes, the smell of casserole\", offers few glaringly Freudian clues to the origins of her later season in hell, and this contributes to the memoir's disturbing pull: if this much-loved virginal bluestocking could become a drug-raddled hooker, then - presumably, potentially - so could anyone else. Holden went on to study archaeology, classics and literature at Melbourne University (\"I was going to be an archaeologist who read Virginia Woolf in a tent\"), graduated, and continued to navel-gaze and pub-crawl with a group of friends. Eventually the gang began to exclude her as they experimented with heroin. \"I had dallied in the ragged life of the pot-smoking student, but I was still at heart a sensible prude ...\" she writes. \"No one made me try heroin. My friends told me to keep away.\" Nevertheless, she succumbed: \"Just once, to know.\" Within two weeks she was addicted. \"Heroin is like wading into the sea. The first fizz of water at your ankles is delicious, shocking. You're aware of every cold pulse of water against your skin ... The water is still shallow, though the bottom slopes. You're delighted as you relax into the sway, the buckle of the waves. You grin with pleasure, and you think, Why didn't I come in sooner? How gorgeous, how thrilling! Then abruptly the sand drops beneath your next step, and you plunge into deeper water, and you can't feel the bottom anymore.\" In two months, \"sleek and luminous\" with smack, she felt ill if she didn't inject. Failing at rehab, sacked from her bookshop job, her addiction plunged her into a spiral of hunger, homelessness and ultimately prostitution. The link between the need to score, subsequent poverty, and walking the streets is shown here with a clarity that makes it easy to understand that age-old cycle of destitution and prostitution. \"The drugs were slow syrup in my mind ... Heroin interferes with the chemical transmitters of the brain; it substitutes its own balms ... The drug had its own psyche, embedded in my mind.\" Holden doesn't dramatise. She neither asks for pity nor lays blame, paying apt tribute to her phenomenally courageous and understanding parents. She simply conjures up a world that most of us blithely and mistakenly imagine we know something about: a world of food vouchers, theft among friends, hairy backs, semen spat out of car windows, fights over condoms, haggles over pitifully low prices, \"the bite of the needle and its luxurious savagery\". For Holden, all cash earned paid her dealer: she went hungry, yet worked every night. Once she substituted Melbourne's streets for its brothels, she gained an element of control, living in a series of boarding houses, supporting a smack-head boyfriend, and servicing clients nightly. The suspicion-laced camaraderie among the wives, mothers and junkies working in the sex industry is movingly described. Educated, artistic, articulate, there is never a sense of the author slumming it. Addiction is a leveller, and Holden was a junkie attempting to survive. In the relative safety of the more upmarket licensed brothels with their health checks, panic buttons and hygiene policies, she even felt a growing sense of professional accomplishment and vanity. Her feminist objections tangled with a classic late 20th-century inversion of oppression as she flirted with notions of \"empowerment\". The horrors are coolly described: \"The shift had started at seven and I'd done nine bookings. My body was feeble, my skin clammy, my eyes burning dry. Allowing someone to touch me was a test of nerves already shrieking ... These were the testing times, when I felt my soul clench; when it was a matter of pride that I didn't protest or throw the man off me.\" Strangely, the unexpected pleasures of prostitution make for more uncomfortable reading, simply because they defy our expectations or challenge our political objections. Holden spent her time \"dreaming the hour away while they ploughed at me. Men who flushed me full of anger and offence. Men who made me warm with the joy of real human contact, an unexpected kindness, a sincere compliment ... I began to love the tenderness of their skin, the anxieties they confessed, the humility of their needs ... If the connections were right, I might feel something extraordinary ... The good ones were my secret.\" After using for almost five years, Holden experienced a significant mental shift. With the help of methadone and her family, she finally junked the habit and left her brothel. Poor self-esteem and its counterpart, fully confessed hubris, wind through this book, providing the only tangible cause of her descent into addiction. \"I had never felt so competent, so adored,\" she writes of her time in a brothel. There's now a big market in the kind of grief porn that provides the reader with a sensation of shock and pleasant superiority; but again, for all its degradations, In My Skin challenges such a response. It makes for discomfiting, illuminating reading. \u00b7 Joanna Briscoe's novel Sleep with Me is published by Bloomsbury in paperback on June 5.
