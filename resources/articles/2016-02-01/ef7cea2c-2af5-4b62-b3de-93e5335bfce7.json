Referencing his social media outburst in September when he was denied a late move to Tottenham, Berahino wrote: \u201cEveryone waiting once again for the silly little spoilt boy to make same mistake so here you go. Goodnight all and thanks for the support.\u201d Earlier, the Baggies had rejected a \u00a321m bid from Newcastle and stressed there was no chance of Berahino being allowed to move before the end of the transfer window. In September, Berahino revealed his frustration after the West Brom chairman, Jeremy Peace, rejected two deadline day bids for him from Tottenham. \u201cSad how i cant say exactly how the club has treated me but i can officially say i will never play Jeremy Peace,\u201d Berahino wrote at the time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
