Wah! Girls \u2013 review", "bodyText": "Not only despots and murderous conspiracy but prophecy and magical portents. In setting Julius Caesar in a riven African state, Gregory Doran has gone to the heart of Shakespeare's play and set up a glow around his own future as artistic director \u2013 dictator? first among equals? sovereign head? \u2013 of the RSC. There is no straining for \"relevance\". This is not a relocation that tries to startle its audience with modern parallels: rather, it finds out a place where supernatural warnings might carry weight, where bloodthirsty chaos threatens and where people might be stirred in a public space, and sinuously unwinds the play's arguments. A powerful design by Michael Vale puts a giant statue of a leader towering above the stage, his fat back to the people he's supposed to be championing. Heat blazes off copper-coloured plaques in the opening moments, and heat is one of the keynotes of Doran's production. It prises open the pliable crowd, who sway to the beat of drums (in a welcome development music has also spread into the normally staid RSC foyer). Paterson Joseph's fervent, blundering Brutus seems to produce a new drop of sweat for each new anguish. Cyril Nri's energetically troubled Cassius, who has to be restrained from giving Mark Antony a stab, goes bare-breasted through the storm. The closeness and estrangement of the two men is put across with unusual force, as if their conspiracy were the shadow of their friendship. In the course of the evening the backdrop's copper tones turn to cindery grey so that \u2013 it's a subtle touch \u2013 they come to match the ashen rags of the Soothsayer, who sways in tattered and chalky-faced in the opening scene, and hovers above the action patrolling crucial moments. It's extraordinary how many different notes Doran manages to touch in a production that moves on one uninterrupted gust. Jeffery Kissoon is a haughty and strained Caesar. As Mark Antony, Ray Fearon ripples with eloquence and is quite comically persuasive: he makes you aware of his manipulation even as he cajoles \u2013 and in doing so makes you the more manipulated. Meanwhile, a tiny role has been shaken and perhaps redefined for ever. In a Rosencrantz and Guildenstern moment, Brutus's servant Lucius becomes in Simon Manyonda's hands a character who maps the arc of the play: first, a small and acquiescent companion, then a humorous turn; and finally the agent of tragedy. It's the combination of polemic and facetiousness that sinks The Physicists, the second production Josie Rourke has directed since taking over the Donmar. Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt wrote his debate about the social responsibility of scientists in 1961, at the height of nuclear war anxiety, and set it in a pre-One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest sanatorium where the nurses are boxing champs or weight-lifters and the patients are genius scientists pretending to be mad and doing a bit of nurse-killing on the side. Rourke, helped by Rob Jones's glarey white design, speeds the action along as much as she can but she can't disguise the fact that though this play has a good heart and mind it moves on leaden feet: the absurd humour is not so much a further layer of physical uncertainty as an attempt to distract from thesis-waving. A fine cast does not flag. Sophie Thompson, with the brief of \"hunchbacked old maid\", does tour-de-force grotesquerie while Miranda Raison supplies preternatural bloom. John Heffernan, who created such a memorable high-volatility Richard II last year at Bristol's Tobacco Factory, shows what a big future he can have as he reins in his natural hyper-expressiveness in a controlled performance that bubbles with peculiarity. Wah! Wah! Girls is the latest bland and messy fusion from World Stages, the project which recently gave us the beautifully designed but verbally null Wild Swans and the sprawl called Babel. This attempt to bring Bollywood to E15 has a terrific pedigree: Kneehigh's Emma Rice as director, new music from Niraj Chag, a book and lyrics by Tanika Gupta. But despite sumptuously coloured dance sequences it only occasionally lifts off. A sequence at the centre of the show suggests what might have been. A traditional dancer, as curving and precise as a signature in Sanskrit, is affectionately mocked by pupils who mimic her practices \u2013 the wheedling, the teasing with eyes, the pretence of timidity and restraint. She takes to the stage with a 21st-century angry girl who flings herself vividly around. As the two women dance together, mimicking a celebrated Bollywood sequence, they suggest reconciliation. The show should have had confidence in this eloquent language: as it is, with its checklist of London life (pigeons and Polish builders feature largely), it's an exercise in box tikka-ing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
