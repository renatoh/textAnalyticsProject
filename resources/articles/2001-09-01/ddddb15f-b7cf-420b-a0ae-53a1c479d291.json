The home secretary also revealed that he intended to include reserve powers in his forthcoming police bill to ensure that remedial action could be taken against chief constables who failed to provide levels of service as laid down by a new Whitehall police standards unit.Mr Blunkett made clear in his speech to the Police Superintendents' Association he intended to press on with his assault on outmoded work practices in the police - such as planning their shift rotas a year in advance - and would tackle the problem of early retirements. It was his proposals to extend police powers to non-police personnel that raised immediate anxieties. \"We don't want any suggestion that these people will reduce police officers. There are dangers that this will be seen as a cheap way of policing,\" warned Kevin Morris, the superintendents' president. Mr Blunkett said the power to detain suspects would stop short of the constables' traditional power of arrest, but would include holding suspects until the police arrived, taking name and addresses, and collecting surveillance video evidence. \"We are looking to extend some further limited powers to non-police personnel. This is not policing on the cheap but a realistic, hard headed approach to deploying and coordinating the people such as traffic wardens and streets wardens, who are already working in the area,\" said Mr Blunkett. In a reference to last week's high court ruling over Oakington immigration detention centre, the home secretary added: \"I have just seen how the courts work under the Human Rights Act. I know perfectly well what the difficulties and dangers are in these areas. That is not going to stop me.\" The police bill envisages giving private security guards and wardens the power to be deployed under police supervision on occasions such as outside nightclubs at weekends, as well as raising the \"official presence\" in streets and neighbourhoods. The home secretary said he was determined to increase the visible presence of authority figures on the streets and would also ensure that the status of patrolling would be restored. \"Disciplining somebody by putting them back in uniform is tantamount to degrading the beat bobby to second class status,\" he said. In his speech in Kenilworth, Mr Blunkett also gave further details on how the proposed police standards unit would work, saying it was not about creating school style league tables or \"naming and shaming\". But it was vital that, when it came to improving detection and clear up rates, wherever anybody lived they could expect the same standards of service. The public did not have a choice when it came to policing. \"Even the rich have to leave their enclaves or protected apartments\", he said. While Mr Blunkett fully expected the police to cooperate with the drive to raise standards, he would as a last resort take reserve powers in the forthcoming bill to require remedial action to be taken if a particular force failed to provide a satisfactory service. The powers, which would override the traditional local discretion of the police authority, would mean that management consultants or staff from the standards unit would go into the affected force and ensure that the particular problem was tackled. Mr Morris welcomed Mr Blunkett's \"robust\" approach but said he had to tread carefully on constitutional issues. \"I cannot imagine a failing basic command unit not having its commander being removed by a chief constable before the intervention of the standards unit.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
