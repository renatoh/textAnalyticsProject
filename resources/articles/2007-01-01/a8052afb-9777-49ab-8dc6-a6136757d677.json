In a nationally televised address denouncing the \"poisonous, horrible lies\", an increasingly angry Mr Katsav blamed the media for his troubles and said he would \"fight to my last breath, even if it means a world war, to clear my name\". \"Don't believe the libel, the defamation, the lies. There is only one truth ... I am the target of one of the worst attacks in the history of the state of Israel,\" he said. \"If the attorney general decides on an indictment ... I promise to resign immediately.\" At one point, he screamed at a reporter, saying he should be ashamed of himself for his coverage of the scandal. \"I did not commit any of the acts that are attributed to me,\" Mr Katsav said. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, tonight became the highest-ranking politican to call on him to resign. \"Under these circumstances,\" Mr Olmert said, \"there is no doubt in my mind that the president cannot continue to fulfill his position, and he must leave the president's residence.\" Mr Katsav has faced growing calls to resign since the attorney general, Meni Mazuz, announced yesterday that he planned to charge the president with a series of crimes stemming from accusations by former female members of his staff that he forced them to have sex with him. He is alleged to have raped one woman and assaulted another. Mr Katsav, who was born in Iran, implied that the charges against him were motivated by racism against Israelis of Middle Eastern origin, whom he said Jews of European heritage had traditionally marginalised. \"I saw myself as a symbol for all those who are not part of the elite clique born with silver spoons in their mouths ... who believe that only they can represent the people of Israel,\" he said. Mr Katsav, who as president has largely ceremonial powers, will have the chance to make his case in one final hearing before a decision is made about whether to hand down a formal indictment. A suggestion yesterday by Mr Katsav's lawyers that he would resign if charged was later dismissed by other staff. If he is charged, it will be the first time a serving Israeli president has been indicted with a crime. The president has always maintained his innocence The issue first arose in July last year when the president complained to the attorney general that he was being blackmailed by the woman he is now alleged to have raped. Once the investigation began, the focus turned on the president himself and the Israeli media were filled with lurid accounts of the case. Last night, Mr Katsav's lawyer said the president was innocent and that some of the evidence had come from employees who were angry at losing their jobs. \"The president believes that everyone will see that he is the victim of false charges,\" David Libai said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
