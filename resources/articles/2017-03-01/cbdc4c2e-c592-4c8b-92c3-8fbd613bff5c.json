As exclusively revealed in the Guardian in December, the ECB is understood to be hopeful of staging two separate matches at the former Olympic Stadium during the next ICC World Cup, taking place in England and Wales in 2019. One of the fixtures will feature England and could be watched by a crowd of 66,000, more than double the capacity of Lord\u2019s. Negotiations are yet to be completed, but when asked about the possibility, the chief executive of the ECB, Tom Harrison, said: \u201cIt would be an amazing statement \u2013 60,000 people in a ground in the UK watching World Cup cricket. It\u2019s making a statement about what cricket means in this country.\u201d Harrison was speaking at the launch of the ECB\u2019s All Stars Cricket initiative, a scheme to attract children into the sport. It also comes as plans for a T20 tournament, with teams featuring, in Harrison\u2019s words, \u201cthe best players in the world\u201d, look set to be ratified. The initiatives will be seen by some as an attempt to redress a decade of lost opportunities as live cricket disappeared from free-to-air television and the Twenty20 format, invented in England, flourished to a greater extent overseas in the form of the Indian Premier League and Australia\u2019s Big Bash. All Stars Cricket hopes to attract upwards of 50,000 children between the ages of five and eight each summer through an eight-week scheme run by local cricket clubs and funded by the ECB. The money comes as part of a \u00a34m uplift in funding to increase participation in the sport. \u201cIt\u2019s the right time to put cricket at the forefront of a child\u2019s experience\u201d said Harrison of the scheme. \u201cIt\u2019s about winning the battle of the playground. We know that this age is crucial in a child deciding what they want to do in their spare time and in the past [learning cricket] has been a frustrating experience. It has been very much a case of \u2018turn up in your whites and sit at third man for an hour\u2019.\u201d Harrison places an emphasis on persuading mothers to enrol their children in the scheme. He also sees mothers bringing children to watch live cricket as integral to the success of the T20 tournament expected to launch in the summer of 2020. Running alongside the successful T20 Blast tournament, the competition is expected to mimic the structure of Australia\u2019s Big Bash League and will feature eight, new city-based teams. \u201cI think it will be incredibly different,\u201d said Harrison of the tournament. \u201cIt will feature the best players in the world, delivering \u2018appointment to view\u2019 [must-see TV] on a regular basis, and crucially you\u2019re targeting a new audience, delivered through new brands that connect with them in a different way. We\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happened elsewhere in the world and we\u2019ve got our own take on how we get that done. \u201cBlast has been very successful for local audiences in grounds on Thursday and Friday evenings,\u201d he added. \u201cWe will be creating a very different experience built around family entertainment and built around mum and dad feeling comfortable bringing the children down. It will run during weekends in the school holidays and we\u2019ve positioned it deliberately because of that.\u201d The tournament would begin at the same time as the ECB\u2019s TV rights deal with Sky comes to an end, with some speculation suggesting it could be broadcast on free-to-air TV.Harrison stressed that if cricket is to find a new audience it must also develop its digital strategy. The ECB, he said, had visited California to meet social media companies and it \u201cwouldn\u2019t be long\u201d before such a business made a \u201cbig bet\u201d on sports rights. \u201cThe young positioning is right for cricket and it\u2019s right for media partners\u201d, Harrison said. \u201cIf you can get young people involved it\u2019s a different conversation. We don\u2019t want to have a question mark about being relevant.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
