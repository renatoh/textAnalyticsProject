In the highest-scoring Puppy Bowl of all time, 19 touchdowns were made. Cara, the Fluff\u2019s high-scorer, wins MVP over Henry and Falcor (who both scored 4 touchdowns apiece). That\u2019ll be a controversial call! Most of the puppies featured have already been adopted ... but there are always more animals to adopt. Falcor makes another drive, but Aaron blocks him. Meanwhile, Jamison is looking for revenge and tries to block Falcor \u2013 but fails, and Falcor scores again! It\u2019s now 49-87, in favor of the Ruffs. That\u2019s the game! Smudge\u2019s mother died shortly after he was born, we discover in his \u201cPup Close and Person\u201d, and he and his littermates had no prospects for adoption. One of his adopted siblings, Pong, was in the Puppy Bowl last year. Falcor\u2019s clearly keyed up, though, and bites Jamison\u2019s tail, earning the Ruffs another penalty. Smudge taked advantage of the ref\u2019s split attention, and bites a tail of his own without penalty ... the refereeing here is really spotty today. Team Ruff\u2019s Falcor makes another run for a touchdown, but his drive dies under Dougie\u2019s defense. On his second try, USS Maloy stops his drive \u2013 but Henry makes another touchdown while the Fluff defense is distracted. It\u2019s 49-80 (and a tie for the Puppy Bowl touchdown record, set at Puppy Bowl VIII)! Last up in the fourth quarter forTeam Fluff: Smudge, a Havanese from Orlando; Roscoe, a labrador retriever mix from North Carolina; and Donnie, a shepherd mix from South Carolina. Team Ruff sends out Coveia, a husky mix from Tennessee; Boomer, a shepherd mix from New Jersey; and Zane, a Corgi mix from New Hampshire. It\u2019s not only humans who are watching: Ali (Ruff) and Fritz (Fluff) struggle over toy control and Fritz breaks away but stalls! Meanwhile, Keno breaks away again for a second touchdown, bringing the score to 49-73 in the fourth quarter! While Aria and Ali for Team Ruff fight amongst themselves, Keno of Team Fluff breaks away for a touchdown! It\u2019s still 42-73, though... Starlight\u2019s \u201cPup Close and Personal\u201d story is that she and family were nearly euthanized at a shelter before they were adopted. Lewis tries to tackle Pepper but fails and so goes in for a tailbite! WHERE ARE THE REFS? Fourth Quarter! Team Ruff sends out: Starlight, a chihuahua mix from Florida; Lance, a terrier mix from New Hampshire; and Luigi, a Pekinese/pug from Virginia. Team Fluff\u2019s chance for victory rests on the furry backs of: Keno, a terrier mix from Las Vegas; Fritz, a miniature schnauzer from Florida; and Cheyenne, a chihuahua mix from outside of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Two dogs are already training for 2016: At the end of the third quarter, the score is Team Fluff 35, Team Ruff 73. Team Fluff hasn\u2019t scored at all in the second half year, despite a commanding lead after the first quarter. It\u2019s the last moment of the third quarter, and Falcor makes another touchdown! It\u2019s now 35-73 in favor of Team Ruff! Henry fakes out Team Fluff and scores! It\u2019s 35-66! Falcor of Team Ruff scores again, opening up their lead to 35-59 over Team Fluff! It\u2019s going to be hard to recover. Hemingway\u2019s \u201cPup Close and Personal\u201d reveals that he was the product of a teenage mother, and his whole family was brought into a shelter. They\u2019re being fostered on a farm, where he\u2019s learning to interact with goats. Jamison tackles Aaron \u2013 his own Fluff teammate! And Falcor\u2019s drive to goal is stymied. Team Fluff\u2019s having a hard couple of quarters. Henry of the Ruffs breaks away from Lee for a touchdown \u2013 Henry\u2019s second \u2013 bringing the score to 35-52! Halfway through the third quarter, Team Fluff fields: Maxwell, a labrador mix from Pennsylvania; Jamison, a pit bull terrier mix from Philadelphia; and Hemingway, a Great Pyrenees mix from western Virginia. Team Ruff counters with: Scarlet, a doberman pinscher from Iowa; USS Dash, a golden mix from Virginia; and Faulkner, another Great Pyrenees mix. Are you in it to win it? Lewis earns a penalty for \u201cpaws to the face\u201d on Pepper, and the camera pans to Liil Bub, who declares herself a Lewis fan. Miss Martian finally breaks away for a touchdown, bringing the score to 35-45 in favor of Team Ruff. Drew Carey tries to drive for the endzone, but is stopped at the 10, after which it\u2019s time for her \u201cPup Close and Personal\u201d. She started off in a shelter in LA, after which she hit the big time with an appearance on the Price is Right, where she won her trip to the Puppy Bowl \u2013 and a new family. Miss Martian isn\u2019t giving up, challenging Aria for the rope toy. Drew Carey breaks it up. But it\u2019s still a scoreless second half so far. Miss Martian fumbles her first drive into the waterbowl, after which Lorelai starts shadowing her to keep her out of the endzone. Drew Carey and Kojak get a penalty for excessive kisses, leading to a time-out. And in quarter 3, Team Fluff sends out: Miss Martian, a coonhound mix from Tennessee; Drew Carey, a cocker spaniel from California; Kojak, a beagle mix from Iowa; Sniffles, a Shih Tzu mix; and Pepper, a Boston terrier mix from Virginia. Team Ruff fields: Lewis, a Shar Pei from Iowa, Aria, a labrador mix from Illinois; and Lorelai, a Maltese poodle mix from Iowa. The puppies have banded together to evict the kittens from the control room, and end the cat video takeover (with the ref\u2019s help.) Kittens have taken over the control room! And turned on Henri le Chat Noir (and various other cat videos). If you\u2019re not familiar with his oeuvre, his last original video is below. I guess I could\u2019ve guessed they were going to play \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d. Karry Furry looks ... less than happy about being here with us. At the end of the first half, Team Ruff is leading Team Fluff 28-45 It\u2019s time for the Kitty Halftime Show, where Katty Furry will be performing. Marley gets yet another touchdown for Team Ruff, and it\u2019s 28-45 at the end of the first half. USS Maloy gets his \u201cPup Close and Personal\u201d, where it\u2019s revealed that his mother was homeless in Alabama. A rescue organization brought her to Virginia where he was born (with eight brothers and sisters). They\u2019re all training to be therapy dogs. Falcor\u2019s second drive, but is blocked by Team Fluff in every direction. He passes to Henry, who goes straight for the endzone and gets another touchdown! Team Ruff has taken a commanding lead. Downfield, Marley and Scooby create a distraction, while Falcor makes a drive for the endzone and touchdown! Team Ruff takes a 4-point lead! The goats use the referee\u2019s absence to snack on the coaches\u2019 playbooks, but the referee saves the day by retrieving all the toys from the locker room. But it\u2019s a twist! All the toys are now missing from the field! Halfway through the second quarter, Team Ruff brings out: Lee, a boxer mix from Kentucky; Falcor, a clumber spaniel from Iowa; Marley, a labrador retriever mix from South Carolina; and Henry, a labrador mix from Pennsylvania. Team Fluff calls in: USS Maloy, an Australian shepherd mix; Aaron, a boxer mix from Kentucky; Dougie, a labrador mix from South Carolina; and Izzie, an Australian shepherd mix from Louisiana. During the commercial breaks, check out these goat cheerleaders: The is a rough game, folks, don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise: Bryan Adams kicks the second-ever field goal in Puppy Bowl history, bringing the score up to 28-24! Don\u2019t count Team Ruff out... Titan then tackles Maggie, and drives into the endzone for Team Ruff! 28-21! Crimson and Team Fluff earn a penalty for roughing against Lola on Team Ruff, but Freckles takes it in stride and runs for another touchdown! It\u2019s Team Fluff in the lead 28-14! Blue gets a turnoverfor Team Ruff, then loses it in a turnover to Team Fluff\u2019s Maggie, who stalls on the 20 yard line. Papi challenges Team Ruff\u2019s Lola, who pulls the pink toy and Papi almost into the endzone but loses in another turnover. Meanwhile, Chicklet dashes from the 30 to the goal for another Team Fluff touchdown, bringing the score to 21-14. Crimson\u2019s \u201cPup Close and Personal\u201d reveals that his mom, Juno, was rescued and fostered shortly before birth on a farm outside of Atlanta. He\u2019s got six brothers and sisters still back on the farm. In the second quarter, Team Fluff sends out: Chicklet, an Australian Shepherd mix from Idaho; Freckles, a hound mix from North Carolina; Maggie, a beagle mix from Georgia; Bailey, a labrador retriever mix from the Cayman Islands; Crimson, a Jack Russell terrier from Atlanta; and Papi, a Corgi mix from New Hampshire. Team Ruff brings out: Bryan Adams, a labrador retriever mix from Puerto Rico; Blue, a schnauzer poodle from Iowa; and Titan, an American bulldog from North Carolina. Rumors abound about special guests at the Kitty Half Time Show: At the end of the first quarter, the score is tied between Team Ruff and Team Fluff, 14 to 14. The goat cheerleaders aren\u2019t winning over the crowd. Team Ruff\u2019s infighting is costing them time and touchdowns. Sport Illustrated has a look behind the scenes at the Puppy Bowl: Bowser\u2019s whiffing as well, and even the cats in the skybox are bored! But Sassy and Kiaria start a battle over the purple toy, but even an assist by Bowser can\u2019t get it into the endzone for Team Ruff. But in the confusion, Bubba takes the green toy into the endzone for the second touchdown for Team Ruff, tying things up! Quarter one is over! Kiaria and Sassy are battling mid-field for the pink noodle, and Sassy gives up ... so Kiaria does as well. The goats are having trouble keeping viewers interested. Cara tries for another touchdown, but is stymied at the 35 yard line. The score remains 14-7 in favor of Team Fluff. Bowser\u2019s had a tough life, as we learn in \u201cPup Close and Personal\u201d segment: his mother took ill 10 days after he was born, and his foster mom, Jessica Busch, found a surrogate to nurse him. After he got better, he was chosen for a spot on the Ruff team and got his first bath. Uh-oh! Bowser and Bubba started fighting amongst themselves on Team Ruff! And then Bowser starts squabbling with Kiaria, too! He\u2019s clearly not a team player. Post commercial break, it\u2019s a new line-up! For Team Ruff we\u2019ve got: Penelope, a pug from Orlando; Kiaria, a Japanese Chin from North Carolina; and Bowser, a Pekingese mix from Virginia. Team Fluff\u2019s fielding: Rosie, a Havanese from Florida; Oscar Marcus, a Shih Tzu mix from Virginia; and Savannah, a Shih Tzu from Georgia. If you\u2019re wondering what this is all about, ABC News has a primer. This year, the puppies are joined by miniature goat cheerleaders. There\u2019s already talk of making Cara the MVP, but Animal Planet\u2019s sideline reporter, Meep the Bird. Cara, though, was having none of that, and takes it back for another Team Fluff touchdown! Steve took the blue birdie and made a run for his own endzone, but his drive was spoiled by Cara. But Graham and Fiona tussle over a rope toy mid-field, allowing Bubba to drive the blue birdie into the endzone for Team Ruff. Ah, they left the girl puppy, Fiona, off the starter announcement! Panda\u2019s already trash-talking Team Ruff. With Team Ruff distracted, Cara makes a play for the blue birdie, and carries it down the sideline for a touchdown (despite an effort at a tackle by Bubba). Team Fluff (in yellow) took the field first: Cara, a Shih Tzu from Orlando, Florida; Sassy, a miniature poodle mix from Asheville, North Carolina; and Panda, a Pomeranian. Team Ruff\u2019s starters (in green) included: Bubba, a chihuahua mix from Florida; his brother Steve; Enzo, a Yorkie from St Louis, Missouri; and Pudge, another Chihuahua mix from Florida. Already, the odds seem weighted in Team Ruff\u2019s favor. And, if you missed the pre-game show, you\u2019ll have to view it on their site \u2013 their embed isn\u2019t working. They\u2019re showing video of them loading the puppies on the bus, but one poor puppy got left behind, for the referee to pick up in his new car (in an advertisement for their automotive sponsor). Good afternoon (or evening, for our UK readers) and welcome to The Guardian\u2019s extremely serious liveblog of one of the sporting events of the year: Animal Planet\u2019s original Super Bowl counterprogramming, the Puppy Bowl. We\u2019re starting a little early this year, as it\u2019s not technically counter-programming anymore."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
