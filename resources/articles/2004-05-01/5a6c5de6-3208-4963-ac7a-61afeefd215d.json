In extreme circumstances Big Game Golf can be dangerous. At the Hans Merensky Estate course bordering the Kruger National Park at Phalaborwa, South Africa, a German woman dropped her club and grabbed her camera as a large male elephant emerged from the bush. Her husband and son were watching as she tried one angle and then another. The elephant pawed the ground and offered warning roars. The woman dodged around, trying for better angles. The elephant became more and more angry. It had broken through the Kruger Park fence and wanted to return. The woman kept getting in its way, persisting to get one more shot. It was her last. Leon Pappas, Hans Merensky's resident professional for many years, his golf and wild animal photography renowned, recalls with profound concern the only fatality he has known. \"That was it. The wild belongs to the animals, and you have to respect it in every way.\" In the South African bush, walking and cycling safaris have never been more popular. But golfing safaris? Are they not a contradiction in terms? As Tony Jacklin once remarked, \"Concentrate too hard on a tree in your path and all you'll see is a jungle.\" Can't the same apply to a lion? See one and there's a pride for you? Not according to Leon. \"Animals pick up on fear and animosity. When you are in to your game of golf they understand you are not an enemy. Don't do anything in a hurry with them, that's all. And don't think because you are in a buggy you are safe from anything. It's not a tank. You must still respect their rights,\" he says. His domain, the Hans Merensky, is named after a German geologist whose discovery of copper led to the mining which still goes on close by, in places over a mile deep. A Dubliner, Xavier McAuliffe, bought the failing estate from the mining company in the knowledge that this was Ernie Els's favourite course, and set about gaining the planning permission for up to 74 fairway developments which would save it. Bob Grimsdell's 5,044m, par 72 course is carved from a vast area of low veldt with holes such as Leopard Kill (15th) and Buffalo Bend (16th) suggesting the many animals that can be observed on the course, especially at dawn or dusk. \"We have to be careful. This has to remain golf in the wild,\" says Leon, \"and though the animals have retreated a bit while the building is going on, it is their territory.\" \"It's why you take nothing for granted,\" says Leon's son, Sean. \"It's why after dark you call a buggy for the restaurant. Not long ago, on the 15th fairway, we saw these porcupine quills in the semi-rough. We were taking a look when suddenly there was a growl. A lion had just killed the porcupine. We backed off slowly.\" After touching down on the Johannesburg flight, we dump our bags in the thatched chalets around the kraal-like hotel complex and are out on the first tee for nine holes before dark. It is drizzling slightly and we wear fleeces. On the low veldt there are significant temperature fluctuations. My six-iron off an above average drive lands in a bunker left side of the green. Fifteen inches away is the spoor of a lion. Next day we bask in warm sunlight by the pool (game drives in the adjacent Kruger Park and boat cruises on the nearby Olifants River are also available) planning a late round on Leon's advice that on such a day the animals will be best observed towards dusk. He's right. As I pull a five-iron close to trees half a dozen baboons scatter. Colours deepen, and shadows take on extra meaning as the sun sinks behind fairway screens of fig, wild syringa, marula and knobthorn. Three short holes demand concentration over wide stretches of water, with warning signs reading \"Danger, hippo and crocodile.\" I concentrate hard and hit a 3-wood across 140 yards of water to the 185-yard 17th. There's an almighty splash, not of my ball, but a hippo surfacing for a vast yawn. Impala can also be seen gracefully stalking the distant green before fading into the darkening forest. \"A priceless experience,\" says Ernie Els. I cannot win an Open, but this comes a good second best. Rounds in the Rainbow Nation Bobby Locke, Gary Player, Ernie Els...South Africa has produced many great golfers, but only with the Rainbow Nation reaching maturity has it begun to exploit its climate, geography and value-for-money to welcome holidaymaking British golfers in its prime summer season - our winter, making February-May and September-October favoured times. In less than two years, the rand has strengthened from around 16 to just over 11 to the pound, but green fees at more than 400 courses remain good value at R100 to R300 (\u00a38.66-\u00a326). Caddies cost R60-100. Top hotels and restaurants offer meals and services at notably lower prices than their European equivalents; hiring a car is approximately \u00a320-\u00a330 a day with the advantage of driving on the left; and cheap internal flights make safari add-ons a serious option. Johannesburg South Africa's commercial capital is an eleven-hour overnight flight from London, but jet lag is minimal, being only two hours ahead, and golfers can be on the tee at any one of 14 courses soon after checking in to their accommodation. Game lodges are five hours by car or a 40-minute flight to Phalaborwa.
