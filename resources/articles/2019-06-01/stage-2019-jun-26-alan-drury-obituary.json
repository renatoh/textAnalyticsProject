His first big success came in 1975 with The Man Himself, a powerful monologue about the pressures that cause a British white collar worker to join the National Front. Commissioned by the National Theatre and first performed by Michael Feast, the play toured widely in both the UK and continental Europe. Subsequently Alan spent several happy years as the resident dramatist at York Theatre Royal, where he produced a play about the Catholic martyr Margaret Clitheroe and a translation of Moli\u00e8re\u2019s The Miser. In 1976 his play Sparrowfall, starring Michael Kitchen, ran at the Hampstead theatre in London. In the late 70s Alan became resident writer at the Royal Court theatre in London and his play An Empty Desk, a wry study of office life, based on experience, was performed at the Theatre Upstairs in London in 1979. Two years later his version of Moli\u00e8re\u2019s The Hypochondriac played in the Olivier theatre, directed by Michael Bogdanov with Daniel Massey in the lead. Alan\u2019s two Moli\u00e8re translations were published in the Methuen Master Playwrights series and remain in print. Born in Hull, east Yorkshire, he was the son of Harold, an insurance inspector, and his wife, Patricia (nee Tait), a teacher. After King Edward\u2019s school, Birmingham, he went to study English at Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge, where he and I met. His first full-length play, Shoreline, was presented at the Edinburgh festival in 1971, with Simon Jones and Sarah Dunant in the cast. Alan\u2019s last major stage work, Mr Hyde (1984), a dark and disturbing study of the sexual underbelly of late Victorian England, toured with the Paines Plough company, but failed to achieve the critical acclaim it deserved. By that point, like many freelances, he was feeling the financial and creative strain of living from commission to commission and so became a script editor in BBC TV drama, then literary manager at Hampstead theatre, and later filled the same post at BBC Radio drama. He was generous and supportive to other writers, giving them clear-sighted and helpful advice. However, although he continued to write for radio, theatre and television, there was a sense he was losing his creative drive. He finally moved to Barrow upon Soar in Leicestershire to look after his widowed mother and stayed on there after her death. Quite recently he told me that he had written nothing for more than 10 years; nonetheless, he liked to point out, lightheartedly, he had written more plays than William Shakespeare. He is survived by his brother, Stephen, and sister, Helen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
