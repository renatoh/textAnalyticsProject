After lengthy negotiations yesterday with the financial services authority, the insurance group was believed to be facing up to the prospect last night of having the regulator step in to conduct an orderly winding-up of its business. The management of Independent Insurance was understood to be still holding out hope that it could avoid being closed down. Led by chairman Garth Ramsay, discussions about a sale of all or part of the busi ness were thought to be continuing last night. But, the one-time stock market darling was understood to be finding it difficult to convince potential buyers of the merits of a deal. The prospect of the regulator stepping in comes after the company's shares were suspended at 81.5p on Monday. The share price fell dramatically from 350p at the start of the year, following a surprise profits warning and the sudden resignation of founder Michael Bright as chief executive in April. While the company had originally appeared optimistic that it could raise \u00a3200m from investors in a share placing at as much as \u00a31 a share, it is be lieved to have all but given up any prospect of putting together a solid prospectus to support the sale. Earlier this week the company had still thought it could complete the share sale by next Tuesday, but this seems increasingly unlikely. The uncertainties surrounding complex contracts designed to lay off its potential losses to Ireco, an arm of US insurance company General Electric, are thought to be causing some of the difficulties. Some members of the board are understood not to have been aware of all the details of the financing of these reinsurance policies, which are thought to have been un earthed since Mr Bright's resignation as chief executive. He is currently a non-executive deputy chairman. The alarm bells began to sound last week when the company admitted it had found \"alleged reinsurance contracts\". In a research note to clients, analysts at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney indicated that they believed the company was trying to unwind these contracts. They admitted they were surprised by the terms of the reinsurance first announced in March when Independent said it was paying a \u00a3110m premium for cover of \u00a3278m of losses. The company refused to comment, as did the FSA."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
