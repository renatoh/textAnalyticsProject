In conjunction with Mr Brown's launch of the government's consultation on the priorities for science over the next 10 years, two companies, GlaxoSmithkline and AstraZeneca, announced over \u00a3100m of investment in individual research, science and technology projects. The chancellor, who had earlier held a breakfast meeting with the heads of leading pharmaceutical companies and members of the research and scientific communities, stressed that the country had to invest in science to \"equip Britain for the new economy\". His announcement was warmly welcomed by scientists. He said: \"Faced with the challenge from America, Japan and the euro area, and witnessing the rise of India and China, we, in Britain, cannot afford not to invest. Indeed, a government that fails to invest in science is a government failing to equip Britain for the new economy.\" The government's priorities for science and innovation over the next 10 years included greater collaboration between universities and business to provide a sharper focus for research; better application of leading-edge technologies in business and the public sector; and a dynamic research base that met the needs of both public and private funders, Mr Brown said. The chancellor, who was joined at the launch by Charles Clarke, the education secretary, and the science and innovation minister, Lord Sainsbury, stressed that the delivery of these objectives would depend on collaboration between the government and business, research foundations and the investment community. A number of major companies, including GlaxoSmithkline, AstraZeneca, Shell, Vodafone, Amersham and Rolls Royce, are already in discussions with the government on how their commercial investment in research and development and innovation can partner public investment in the UK science base. Today GlaxoSmithkline announced a \u00a344m investment in Imperial College, London, to build and equip a clinical imaging centre. Mr Brown said there had been significant boosts for science from the last two spending reviews and pledged to raise science funding as a share of national income from 2005-2006. \"This is a collaborative effort. I am delighted that a whole range of leading research and development businesses have indicated that they wish to work with us on our science strategy and to make their own commitments to the future of British science and innovation over the next decade. Our final funding decisions will reflect the extent of the parallel commitments made by all the key players on research and development in the UK,\" Mr Brown said. \"So this is the challenge I am putting to all our partners, leading businesses and charities, today - with one ambition and purpose: to make Britain the best and most attractive location in the world for science and innovation.\" The consultation will set out the aims and ambitions of the 10-year framework, which include: \u00b7 world class excellence from the best centres of science and technology, driven by competition for funding and talent; \u00b7 a dynamic research base that meets the needs of both public and private funders and is managed effectively to achieve financial sustainability; \u00b7 greater collaboration between universities and business to provide a sharper focus for research and an impetus to innovation and productivity growth; \u00b7 better commercial translation of leading edge technologies into applications in business and the public sector; \u00b7 the science and technology skills that the nation's businesses and public services will need over the next decade, underpinned by excellent teaching in schools to engage the next generation of workers in the knowledge economy; and \u00b7 a society that is confident about the regulation and use of science and technology. The 10-year investment framework for science and innovation will be published as part of the spending review this summer. Save British Science today expressed delight but the director, Peter Cotgreave, said Mr Brown had not attached numbers to these promises. \"Since the chancellor has repeated his belief that investment in science is a necessity, we are now expecting him to put his money where his mouth is. We need to see real, cash-terms increases in the summer spending review if these measures and initiatives are going to make any difference.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
