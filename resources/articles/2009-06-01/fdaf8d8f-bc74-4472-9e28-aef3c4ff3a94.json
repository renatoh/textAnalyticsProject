I fell in love: with Claire Taylor and her namesake Sarah, with Beth Morgan, Charlotte Edwards, and, well, all the England women's cricket team. I heart women's cricket. On a busman's Friday afternoon, sitting in the stand at The Oval, away from the hermetic press box which has less atmosphere than the moon, I watched one of the most exhilarating of cricket matches, played to a standard that astounded, and at the end of it, when Claire Taylor's bottom hand kicked in for the last time and sent the ball scudding away backward of point for the winning boundary, England had beaten Australia. What could be better? I cannot say that I was a women's cricket agnostic, but perhaps a reluctance born from uninformed scepticism kept me away. I was familiar with many of the players, mixed with them at functions and so forth, but never had I seen them play. So to watch them perform with such vivacity and skill was an absolute revelation. It seems unfair to single out individuals, but by the end of the tournament, I can say truthfully that in my opinion, Claire Taylor is not only a very fine pugnacious batter but has incredible drive, a cricket brain to die for, and a rounded view of life. Further, I saw no wicketkeeper in either men's or women's tournament to better Sarah Taylor, a wonderfully gifted youngster. The World Twenty 20 has been a terrific advertisement for the women's game in this country, something, to his great credit, championed by the board chairman Giles Clarke, whose beam on Sunday was one of real delight rather than told-you-so smugness. Scheduling the two competitions to run simultaneously was a masterstroke by the ICC, and I never thought I would write that. It gave women's cricket the sort of promotional opportunity that would cost millions and they grasped it. Personally I hope it is one in the eye for the naysayers who belittle women's cricket. They don't bowl as fast as men, don't hit it as hard. It is a puerile argument. Of course they don't. Neither does Becky Adlington swim as fast as Michael Phelps, nor Lorena Ochoa hit the ball like Tiger Woods. Venus Williams would not take a game from Roger Federer. Would Victoria Pendleton outsprint Chris Hoy? We do not deride or patronise any of these brilliant females yet women cricketers have been patronised and sneered at. It is all about context. It is not all roses though. I don't think I have the attention span to watch a women's Test match, which even those involved admit can be excruciating. But one-day matches are actually the sort of sport that those who wish to learn \u2013 children particularly \u2013 should watch because the way that the top women play is an achievable aspiration for good male cricketers. Kathy Brunt and Holly Colvin rather than Umer Gul or Ajantha Mendis should be bowling role models for 99 per cent of the cricket playing population. I shall go again this season if time permits. Yet the England team did not reach the level they have without help. Between them the ECB, the Chance to Shine initiative and Sport England have given the top women the paid opportunity to coach and act as ambassadors in schools and clubs to offset the unpaid commitment to playing which next year will amount to between 100 and 120 days exclusive of coaching. They are the lucky ones in the women's game, the envy of other countries who lose players quite simply because they cannot afford to carry on. Central contracts cannot be far away. In a way though, their singular dominance, the standard soaring above others, will be its own worst enemy. At present the global standard is generally pitiful, serious competition coming only from Australia, New Zealand and India. So while England look after their own, ICC has to seize on the impetus lent by these past few weeks and pour resources into developing healthy competition. The worry is that the gap will widen, not close, and there will be no viable opposition. For England, expansion is the game now. Clare Connor, the former captain now in charge of women's cricket in this country, is adamant that the nettle has to be grasped on the back of the current achievements, the game promoted aggressively, the players too. These women should be English sporting icons as much as any of our celebrated female athletes. Already, women's cricket is said to be the fastest growing women's team sport in the country. There are now more than 450 clubs with women's and girls' sections. Participation has increased by 49 per cent in the last 18 months. Think what hammering home the current success will do. So there we have it. They have a fan in me. Today they will play Australia again in a T20 at Derby followed by five one-day internationals and then a one-off Test match in Worcester to try to retain the Ashes. Go and watch, please. Especially you sceptics, and admire for what they can do rather than scorn what they cannot. And be prepared for conversion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
