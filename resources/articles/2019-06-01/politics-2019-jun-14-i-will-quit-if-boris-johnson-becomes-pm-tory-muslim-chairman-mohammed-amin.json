Mohammed Amin, a longtime party member, called the Tory leadership frontrunner a \u201cbuffoon\u201d and criticised how he \u201cmocked Muslim women who wear niqab and burka for his own purposes\u201d. \u201cI am not prepared to be a member of a party that chooses him as its leader,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cI would resign after 36 years.\u201d Asked about Johnson\u2019s popularity with party members, Amin said: \u201cThere are many horrible people who have been popular. Popularity is not the test. The test is: is this person sufficiently moral to be prime minister, and I believe he fails that test.\u201d Comparing Johnson\u2019s popularity to that of the Nazi dictator, he added: \u201cA lot of Germans thought that Hitler was the right man for them.\u201d Told that that was a shocking comparison, Amin replied: \u201cYes. I am not saying Boris Johnson wants to send people to the gas chamber, clearly he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s a buffoon. But he, as far as I\u2019m concerned, has insufficient concern about the nature of truth for me to ever be a member of a party that he leads.\u201d Amin continued: \u201cWe don\u2019t expect our politicians, our prime ministers, to be saints. But we do require a basic level of morality and integrity. And of all the candidates in the Conservative party leadership election, Boris Johnson is the only one that I believe fails that test.\u201d The two-term mayor of London put Muslim women at risk last August when he compared women who wore burkas to \u201cletterboxes and bank robbers\u201d, Amin claimed. \u201cHe knew exactly what effect it would have \u2013 it would lead to Muslim women who wear niqab and burka being verbally abused on the streets; in certain cases being physically assaulted, with people trying to tear it off. \u201cHe chose to mock Muslim women who wear niqab and burka for his own purposes.\u201d The former international development secretary, Priti Patel, a supporter of Johnson, said she took issue with some of Amin\u2019s comments, arguing Johnson \u201cwas not mocking women in the way that\u2019s been asserted\u201d, and accusing Amin of \u201cpersonal angst\u201d against him. \u201cI disagree and I\u2019m sorry to hear a member of our party feels that way,\u201d she said. \u201c[Johnson] believes in equality of the sexes and believes in and will defend women\u2019s rights.\u201d Last month, with the Conservatives under pressure to suspend councillors who made anti-Islam comments, Amin said he had \u201clost confidence in the party\u2019s disciplinary processes when the promotion of anti-Muslim hatred is the subject\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
