Addressing the Commons about his plans for a four-week shutdown starting on Thursday, the prime minister also rejected the idea he had been too slow to act, saying it had been right to first try a regional system of different tiers of restrictions. But in response, Keir Starmer accused Johnson of consistently being \u201ctoo slow and behind the curve\u201d in his decisions on Covid, which amounted to a significant failure of leadership. While Labour has pledged to back the new measures in the Commons, all but guaranteeing they will pass, a number of Conservatives have expressed opposition to the planned closure of hospitality businesses and most retail, among other temporary rules. But Johnson said scientific predictions about the \u201cremorseless advance of this second wave\u201d meant the lockdown was inevitable. \u201cFaced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action, at a national level,\u201d he told MPs. \u201cI believe it was right to try every possible option to get this virus under control at a local level, with strong local action and strong local leadership. \u201cAnd I reject any suggestion that we are somehow slower in taking measures than our European friends and partners.\u201d Directly addressing the Tory malcontents, Johnson said: \u201cTo those in this house who believe we should resist further national measures, let me spell out the medical and moral disaster we face.\u201d This would he said, lead the the \u201cdisaster\u201d of the NHS being overwhelmed, affecting not just coronavirus patients, but those with other ailments and needs. He said: \u201cThe sick would be turned away because there was no room in hospitals. That sacred principle of care for anyone who needs it, whoever they are, and wherever, whenever they need it, could be broken for the first time in our lives. \u201cDoctors and nurses could be forced to choose which patients to treat, who would live and who would die.\u201d In response, some MPs said they would vote against the measures on Wednesday. Charles Walker, the senior backbencher who represents Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, said a negative vote was his only way of dissenting \u201cas we drift further in to an authoritarian, coercive state\u201d. Another senior backbencher, Bernard Jenkin, said he would back \u201cthe bitter medicine\u201d from the prime minister, saying: \u201cNobody has put forward a viable, immediate alternative that would avoid the overwhelming of the NHS.\u201d Jenkin asked Johnson to commission a white paper to set out a \u201cplan for living with coronavirus\u201d, and called for a revamp of the test-and-trace system, including a new boss to replace Dido Harding. Johnson also sought to reassure his critics, saying support for self-employed people would be doubled from 40% to 80% of trading profits. This was, he said, not \u201cthe full-scale lockdown of March and April\u201d, and he guaranteed parliament a vote on what happens next when the regulations expire on 2 December. But Starmer \u2013 who had advocated a two-week \u201ccircuit-breaker\u201d lockdown coinciding with the just-ended half term \u2013 said the delay meant the measures would need to be longer and tougher. \u201cAt every stage the prime minister has been too slow and behind the curve,\u201d the Labour leader said. \u201cAt every stage, he has pushed away challenge, ignored advice and put what he hoped would happen ahead of what is happening. At every stage he has over-promised and under-delivered.\u201d Starmer said Johnson\u2019s decision to reject the advice from his scientific advisers in September that a circuit breaker was needed amounted to \u201ca catastrophic failure of leadership and of judgment\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
