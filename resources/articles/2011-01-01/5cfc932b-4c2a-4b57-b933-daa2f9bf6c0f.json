The difficulty beyond that is not that King George had to conquer a terrible stammer \u2013 but that even when he had (rather earlier than the plot of The King's Speech suggests) his speechwriters gave him nothing very interesting to say. George (known privately as Bertie) wasn't just an unexpected monarch. He was the House of Windsor's most obvious dice with destruction, the king whose addresses (however accurately delivered) passed in a somnolent tide of endurance and apathy. I am just old enough to remember the old king's Christmas broadcasts, their conventional messages delivered in parched, precise tones. He didn't do \"human\". He was remote and chill, an unnatural communicator with very little to communicate \u2013 except, in the wheezing of his tubes, the peril of smoking too many packs a day to calm your nerves. But none of this was central either to George VI, or his role, or his place in history. When his stupid, heedless brother fouled the royal nest, somebody had to take his place. Duty summoned Bertie. We're only a year away from celebrating his daughter Elizabeth's 60 years as queen: long, long, long to reign over us. And, as the decades have gone by, an odd sense of permanency has taken hold. She has always been there while everything else has changed; perhaps she will always be there. But if she isn't, if immortality isn't on the menu, then please can we skip a generation and go on to William and Kate? It's a frequently asked opinion poll question that draws an overwhelmingly positive response. Goodbye Ma'am, take an early bath; goodbye Charles and Camilla. Let's bound on to something a little more glamorous, to Diana's elder son: lone keeper of her celebrity sheen. It isn't a scenario that George VI could ever have come to terms with. He didn't want the crown; indeed, he shrank from it as his brother threw his inheritance away. He was frail and stilted. Shyness enfolded him like a cloak of neutral colours. He knew he was deeply unsuitable for the job. He relied on his wife \u2013 a steel butterfly beneath all the fluff \u2013 to drive him on. But there wasn't any choice about what to do. The House of Windsor needed him and his racking cough. The point about hereditary monarchy is that there are no short cuts: if you're the next in line, then argument fades away. This queen will go on and on, to the end. King Charlie and Queen Camilla won't stand aside. Ruling is a relentless plod. And there, for those who would like to see this costly show slew off the road, is the key to how it will happen. Bertie wasn't just a private person; he depended on privacy for survival. The rituals and formalities of court life were allies, not enemies. He wasn't expected to be more than a symbol \u2013 staying in London through most of the war, bidding farewell to empire as the least likely emperor imaginable. But precious little of that symbolism survives today. The Queen gave her privacy away when she first allowed BBC cameras to see her playing happy families, and it has been downhill against disclosure ever since. Here's a door that swings both ways, to be sure. Just as Edward VIII couldn't marry a divorced woman, so King Charles will take a divorcee to Westminster Abbey. But the spirit of the times that made George VI possible \u2013 watch Fleet Street fall silent about Mrs Simpson when Baldwin raises a finger \u2013 has disappeared. Diana almost brought the house down. There are no second chances left. I remember pretty vividly the pall that descended in 1952 when Bertie died in his sleep. I was revising for exams and suddenly all there was as background noise was chamber music. The world, in any sense of normality, had ended. Something momentous had happened. Except that it hadn't. Except that life went on as usual. Except that the portentousness of the passing soon seemed ridiculous. Except that half a century or so later, you could guess the way this kind of world ended: not with a bang, but a stutter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
