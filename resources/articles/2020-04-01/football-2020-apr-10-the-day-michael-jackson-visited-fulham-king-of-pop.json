Still, Keegan apart they were short of superstars. Their record transfer and most famous player was Chris Coleman \u2013 at \u00a32.1m his was the highest fee paid by a third division club, a record beaten only when Sunderland signed Will Grigg 21 years later. The Welsh centre-back was a fine defender but not exactly box office, though they also had the Belgium international Philippe Albert, another centre-back, on loan from Newcastle. Hugh Grant, whose most successful film, Notting Hill, would be premiered in Leicester Square later that month, stood alone as their most famous fan. And then Michael Jackson turned up. The home fixture against Wigan, then seventh in the division, attracted 12,140 to the banks of the Thames and one of them was the King of Pop, whom Fayed coaxed to Craven Cottage after spending the morning showing him around the toy department of Harrods, which the Fulham chairman also owned. \u201cI remember warming up, and then Fayed was leading him around the pitch,\u201d the goalkeeper Maik Taylor recalls. \u201cIt was a glorious day, very hot, and he had an umbrella up, waving and clapping the fans. Obviously we paused our warm-up. He did have an aura about him and we were blown away by it all.\u201d Not every Fulham player was quite so overwhelmed. Indeed, some didn\u2019t even notice. Speaking to the media after the match, the striker Barry Hayles admitted that \u201cI didn\u2019t find out he was here until we were warming down after the game. I shook his hand and posed for photos with him. He just said: \u2018Good game lads.\u2019\u201d More seasoned football-watchers agreed that it most certainly was not a good game, but Fulham had done well enough to beat a defensive Wigan 2-0. \u201cIt was not a classic and I thought they\u2019d come here with more ambition,\u201d said Keegan. Afterwards Fayed brought his special guest to meet the players. \u201cI was about to start my team talk when Mr Fayed marched into the dressing room with a big grin on his face, followed by a tall, rake-thin guy who looked a bit like Michael Jackson,\u201d Keegan \u2013 who seems to remember the visit taking place pre-match \u2013 wrote in his autobiography, My Life in Football. \u201cHe smiled shyly, then I heard him say \u2018Hey\u2019 and it dawned on me that, crikey, this was the real Michael Jackson. It was pointless trying to continue with my team-talk \u2013 the players weren\u2019t listening to a word \u2013 so I walked the King of Pop through the corridors of the old Stevenage Road stand to make him a cup of tea in the players\u2019 lounge.\u201d \u201cMost of us were half-naked, having showers, in good spirits because we\u2019d won,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cAl Fayed was a great character and great among the lads in the dressing room. He came in leading Michael Jackson, and his quote, which made us all howl hysterically, as he came in was: \u2018Hide your willies boys.\u2019 He came in and met the guys briefly, then we all agreed to get our clothes on and go back out on to the pitch to have our photos with him. \u201cWe all got a signed photo of him with the team \u2013 I don\u2019t have it on the wall or anything, but I\u2019ve still got it. At that point he\u2019s one of most famous guys on the planet. I\u2019m still a fan now of his music \u2013 I\u2019ve been to watch the musical Thriller in London; incredible talent.\u201d After the game Jackson gave an interview to the Mirror, in which he described Fayed as \u201cvery wise and creative, talented and kind-hearted, very giving\u201d. Though the game, and particularly the scoreless first half, was by no means a thriller the singer seemed impressed. \u201cI knew nothing about soccer and I\u2019ve never been to any sporting event, so it was a great experience for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a soccer fan now, definitely. I\u2019m addicted. It was so exciting and passionate \u2013 the fans were like the people who come to my concerts. They were screaming and shouting and cheering their players on. I wanted to jump up and start dancing because I\u2019m used to performing on stage when I hear all that noise. Fulham seemed a really good team with a great spirit. I met all the players and they were so kind to me.\u201d Fulham were promoted three days later, when they beat Gillingham 3-0, and made it to the top flight in 2001. Jackson never returned to the club (though there was an even more unexpected visit to Exeter City in 2002), but after the singer\u2019s death his visit was commemorated with a controversial statue, which stood outside Craven Cottage for a little under three years before being returned to Fayed in 2013 by Fulham\u2019s new owner, Shahid Khan. \u201cI was long gone when the statue arrived,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cBut I still tell people the story of the day I met Jacko. It\u2019s something people aren\u2019t aware of. It was short and sweet, but it was amazing to meet him and that was it, really.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
