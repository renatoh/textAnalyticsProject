Muddled government policies over how to provide for these million and more children, along with a shortage of specialist schools and a postcode lottery over availability of facilities, consign parents to bureaucratic purgatory. The problems are exacerbated by unresolved disputes over how best to educate SEN children: whether within mainstream or specialist schools. Parents lurch from crisis to crisis trying to ensure that their children receive an education appropriate to their needs in a safe environment. Many children with statements of special needs may, in addition, be seriously socially vulnerable, so that transfer from a relatively protective primary school to a large secondary one can trigger a major crisis. Too often, hapless parents will spend thousands of pounds and months of precious time arguing their child's case before appeals tribunals. Even Dame Mary Warnock, the architect of inclusion, last year recanted from her position, saying she had heard too many horror stories of special needs children not receiving a proper education. Inclusion is a noble aim for many children, but it requires major investment in schools to help them adjust; many schools have not even started. There must also be sufficient special schools for children who would benefit from that safer environment. Pressure groups and parents have long warned that provision for SEN children is underfunded and chaotic. The mere fact that two-thirds of children excluded from school have special needs shows that all is not well. Next month, the education select committee is expected to publish a highly critical report into provision for these children. It is now up to government to instil order into this deplorably neglected sector. Above all, every education authority must be obliged to provide a basic level of facilities for SEN children and their parents. Successive Education Secretaries have failed hundreds of thousands of children. That has to change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
