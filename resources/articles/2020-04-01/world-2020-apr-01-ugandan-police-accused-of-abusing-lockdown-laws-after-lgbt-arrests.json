Fourteen gay men, two bisexual men and four transgender women were taken into custody on Sunday when police raided a shelter on the outskirts of Uganda\u2019s capital, Kampala. A police spokesperson, Patrick Onyango, said the detainees had been disobeying distancing rules by \u201ccongesting in a school-like dormitory setting within a small house\u201d despite a ban at the time on gatherings of more than 10 people, since reduced to five. Onyango denied allegations made by LGBT campaigners that they were targeted because of their sexual orientation. \u201cWe still have offences of unnatural sex in our law books,\u201d Onyango told Reuters. \u201cWe would charge them with that law, but we are charging them with those counts, as you can see.\u201d Frank Mugisha, the executive director of Sexual Minorities Uganda, said the arrests were \u201ca clear case of discrimination\u201d against the LGBT community. He said the raid followed complaints to police about the shelter from neighbours, and the lockdown-related charges were brought only when it was clear that there was no other justification for holding the detainees . \u201cThe arrests were initially around homophobia and transphobia because neighbours reported them and so the security forces came and raided them. These people were at home and they all know each other,\u201d Mugisha said. \u201cNow they are putting them in prison where they will be more at risk.\u201d Activists in Uganda said the pandemic had contributed to a rise in homophobic rhetoric in Uganda, with the LGBT community being blamed by some for the disease. Homosexuality is illegal in most countries on the African continent. In a handful of states, gay people can face life imprisonment or the death penalty. In Uganda, a largely conservative Christian country, homosexual sex is punishable by life imprisonment. The Refugee Coalition of East Africa, which represents a number of LGBT refugee organisations in the region, said in a statement last month: \u201cWe are in the midst of a public health emergency causing panic, death and fear on an international and widespread level. It merits the attention of the world and its leaders. [But] at the same time, we implore humankind to not let us slip from your consciousness.\u201d The two charges against the group in Uganda \u2013 disobeying a lawful order and committing neglectful acts likely to spread infection of disease \u2013 carry a maximum of two and seven years imprisonment respectively. Uganda announced its first coronavirus case on 21 March and now has 33 confirmed cases."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
