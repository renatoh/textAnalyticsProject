The feature will initially only be accessible for users in the US who have the Facebook iPhone app and will extend the feature to the rest of its 1.6 billion users over the next few weeks. An Android version is also being developed. The live video option has been through two months of testing for selected users in the US. In a blogpost, Facebook said the new feature is accessed by opening a new status update and selecting the \u201clive video\u201d icon. The user can choose who to share the live broadcast with, as well as see the number of real-time viewers and a stream of comments from friends. At the end of a broadcast, videos are saved to the timeline and can be played back or deleted. \u201cYou can discover live videos from your friends and public figures you follow right in News Feed,\u201d the post said. \u201cWhile watching a live video, you can tap the Subscribe button to get notified the next time the broadcaster goes live. Live is also available to public figures and verified Pages.\u201d The new feature will present significant competition to Periscope, the video livestreaming app owned by Twitter that launched in 2015. CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized video during the company\u2019s most recent financial results. He said lighter, less data-intensive versions have been introduced for users in developing countries, as well as more video advertising tools for brands. \u201cWe want to develop even better and engaging experiences, and better tools,\u201d he said. \u201cVideo is an important part of the Facebook experience, and continuing to invest here is important.\u201d Zuckerberg said more than 100m hours of video are watched on Facebook every day and said the site would soon be introducing a dedicated area for watching video. Facebook also announced on 28 January five new reaction buttons to expand the \u201cLike\u201d feature. Love, haha, sad, angry and wow are being tested in several countries, Zuckerberg said during a call with investors. Each response has a corresponding emoji. Facebook also decided not to introduce a yay response with a smiling face and rosy cheeks, he said, because users did not understand it during testing. \u201cWhen you only have a Like button, if you share a sad piece of content or something that makes you angry, people may not have the tool to react to it.\u201d Mark Middlemas, spokesman at online advertising firm RadiumOne, said introducing the new emojis \u201cmakes complete sense\u201d. \u201cEmojis are the world\u2019s fastest-growing digital language, brands including McDonald\u2019s, Ikea and Domino\u2019s are increasingly using them, particularly to target millennials. In the cluttered digital age, and as we become more lazy, they\u2019re a perfect vehicle to share an opinion in one character so users will like them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
