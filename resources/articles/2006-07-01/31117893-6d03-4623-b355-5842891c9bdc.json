The Commons committee on standards and privileges will meet in private this morning to study a confidential report from Sir Philip Mawer, the parliamentary commissioner for standards. The Guardian has learned that Sir Philip has decided the deputy prime minister should receive what amounts to a slap on the wrist - because he swiftly declared the visit (made in July 2005) after its existence became public late last month. Mr Prescott is expected to be told that he should have made such a declaration in the first place. A source with knowledge of the report said: \"It is not up to the committee to question Sir Philip's findings - only to decide what to do as a result.\" Asked how seriously the committee was likely to regard Mr Prescott's failure, the source said: \"My guess would be that their judgment will be along the lines of 'small earthquake, not many dead'.\" Last night Mr Prescott's spokeswoman said he would not comment until the committee had published its report. But, she said: \"[He] is very clear he has done nothing wrong. He is very relaxed about it.\" The verdict comes days before Mr Prescott is due to take over running the country while the prime minister goes on holiday during August. He has claimed Labour's poll ratings rose every time he had been in charge over the past nine years. Mr Prescott has been under intense pressure to resign since his affair with his diary secretary, Tracey Temple, was exposed in April. He has faced speculation over allegations of other affairs. The prime minister stripped him of much of his departmental responsibilities, and his grace and favour home at Dorneywood, and is accused of keeping Mr Prescott in his job only because his departure would increase the pressure for his own departure from office. Last night, Tory sources accepted that, while Sir Philip has found Mr Prescott broke the rules, the report was unlikely to force him to resign. But they believe Mr Blair must order an investigation into Mr Prescott's dealings with Mr Anschutz to see if he has broken the ministerial code, the set of rules governing his conduct as a minister. They want such an inquiry to establish whether Mr Prescott gave special favours to Mr Anschutz, who is seeking to open a casino on the Millennium Dome site. Mr Blair has rejected calls for such an investigation. Sir Philip's report looked solely at Mr Prescott's conduct as an MP, not as a minister. Two weeks ago, Hugo Swire, the Conservatives' culture spokesman, complained to Sir Philip that Mr Prescott should have declared the two-day stay on the Colorado ranch in July last year. Under the rules, MPs are required to make public any hospitality which may reasonably be thought to influence their actions. Sir Philip has also been investigating whether the deputy prime minister should have declared a pair of cowboy boots, a hat and a belt buckle which Mr Anschutz gave him during the visit. In parliament yesterday, the Tories stepped up their calls for Mr Prescott to resign, but these were dismissed by him. William Hague, the Tory foreign affairs spokesman, said: \"Sometimes we all have to judge whether we are doing any favours for our party, our country, or our own reputation. And isn't it time for him to exercise that judgment?\" Mr Prescott said: \"I do not believe there is any act of corruption being committed. And if you have got any evidence, you should provide it - instead of just making the allegations ...\" FAQ Thumbs up or down? Is Mr Prescott now in the clear? It appears likely he will weather the storm over Sir Philip's findings, but is vulnerable if further, damaging allegations emerge. What happens now? The opposition parties have a whole month to take pot shots at Mr Prescott while he deputises for a holidaying Mr Blair; the deputy prime minister claims Labour's ratings have risen every summer that he has been in charge over the past nine years - but in a poll this month, 70% of those questioned, including 59% of Labour voters, think he should resign immediately or be sacked. Why did he go to the ranch ? He says Mr Anschutz invited him while in the US, and they discussed running a ranch and the abolition of slavery; he was with his civil servants."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
