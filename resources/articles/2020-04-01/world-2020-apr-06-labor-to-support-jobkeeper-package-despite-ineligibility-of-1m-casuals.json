On Monday Porter said the Australian Council of Trade Unions proposal \u2013 that any casual who \u201creasonably expected\u201d to remain employed but for the Covid-19 crisis should receive the $1,500 fortnightly payment \u2013 was \u201ctoo broad and ill-defined\u201d. The government\u2019s refusal means that one million casual employees with less than 12 months\u2019 service would be ineligible for the payment, and instead must claim the $1,100 jobseeker payment and coronavirus supplement. The government has, however, softened the rules for registered charities, which will now only need to show a 15% reduction in turnover to qualify. The changes ease eligibility for not-for-profit services including childcare centres, and raised the hopes of the university sector they would also benefit. But on Monday the assistant charities minister, Zed Seselja, clarified that non-government schools and universities will have to meet the higher threshold of a 30% downturn. Porter told reporters in Canberra the changes showed the government had \u201ctried to be as inclusive as possible\u201d but when it came to shorter term casuals missing out \u201cthere have to be some definitions and some lines drawn\u201d. Asked to confirm the government will not extend eligibility, Porter replied that the definition of \u201csystemic and regular employment with the same employer for a 12-month period\u201d is in the Fair Work Act. \u201cThat\u2019s the definition.\u201d Porter suggested casuals who miss out may not be much worse off because there is \u201cgoing to be an equivalence between a casual worker who would receive jobkeeper \u2026 and someone who would have to go on to the jobseeker payment but also has the capacity to pick up work as well\u201d. Porter said that some businesses \u201con the edge of viability can only afford to pay a worker the $1,500 jobkeeper amount\u201d. \u201cSo the structural problem that the legislation needs to deal with \u2026 [is that] unless we change the Fair Work Act, we cannot guarantee that a worker can lawfully work the right amount of hours for the $1,500 payment.\u201d The government\u2019s bill, seen by the ACTU and soon to be sent to Labor ahead of debate and a vote on Wednesday, rectifies the situation by allowing employers to vary their employees\u2019 hours up or down to the number covered by the $1,500 at the regular rate of pay. Porter argued the alternative, changing 120 modern awards, would take \u201cweeks if not months\u201d to complete \u2013 although unions dispute this, citing the fact employers have nominated just 15 awards that must urgently change in their negotiations. \u201cI\u2019ve described it as $130bn worth of lifeboats going out,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThis is parliament\u2019s Dunkirk moment. We get the lifeboats out, and we save jobs, and we do it in the simplest, clearest guaranteed formula that parliament can devise.\u201d Dominique Lamb, the National Retail Association chief executive officer, told Guardian Australia she supports unions\u2019 push to expand eligibility because \u201cif you\u2019re in employment you should be eligible for jobkeeper\u201d. Lamb said the retail industry is diverse, with many entering the workforce without English as a first language, and her members had concerns that there was no safety net for temporary visa holders, many of whom had families that were not eligible for any type of welfare. In addition to expanding eligibility to shorter term casuals and temporary visa-holders, Labor would prefer changes be implemented to awards rather than the Fair Work Act, to accommodate union concerns that employers not experiencing financial distress would seek to benefit by forcing workers to run down their leave and cutting their hours. But on Monday the manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, conceded he could not imagine any circumstances under which Labor would oppose the bill. Burke told reporters in Sydney that the Fair Work Commission could move at \u201clightning speed\u201d and the changes to hours would be \u201csimple and fast\u201d in most awards, while avoiding the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of legislative change. For example, Burke suggested the system could be open to \u201cabuses\u201d such as an employer directing an employee whose regular hours did not amount to $1,500 in pay to then cook and clean at the employer\u2019s home. Burke \u2013 who has identified that millions of workers could be left without leave due to a loophole in jobkeeper \u2013 warned the payment was \u201cmeant to be a wage subsidy\u201d but on current drafting employers could \u201ctake it for themselves\u201d by using it to pay down accrued leave entitlements. Earlier, Porter sought to allay concern about the legislation, insisting the changes will only last for six months. He also pointed to a \u201csecondary requirement about the viability of the business, and the necessity to give a direction around hours worked to save the job of the employee in question\u201d. Porter said the Fair Work Commission would be able to review an employer direction \u201cso that there will be safeguards in the process of trying to make the hours match the $1,500 payments\u201d. Childcare centres, non-government schools and private educational providers have emerged as potential winners from eligibility changes for charities. Goodstart Early Learning said it was \u201cvery relieved\u201d to learn that it was now eligible to apply for the $1,500 per fortnight subsidy for its staff. \u201cAccess to the jobkeeper payments is vital as it will ensure that we can trade through this very difficult time,\u201d the chief executive, Julia Davison, said in a statement. Seselja said the \u201c15% decline in the turnover threshold is aimed at charities like the Salvation Army and Catholic Social Services Australia\u201d. \u201cNon-government schools and universities are eligible for the jobkeeper payment. \u201cHowever, they will need to meet the turnover threshold of 30% for those with an annual turnover of less than $1 billion.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
