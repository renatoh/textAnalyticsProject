The UK luxury goods group yesterday announced a better than expected 21% increase to \u00a367m in first half profits, powered by a 17% increase in sales. \"Burberry's encouraging performance... reflects the diversity of our business across product categories, channels and regions,\" said chief executive Rose-Marie Bravo. The company said it was \"comfortable\" with market forecasts for a full year profit of \u00a3131m-\u00a3137m. Ms Bravo took the opportunity to deny as \"totally without foundation\" rumours that she may be about to leave to take over from Domenico de Sole as chief executive of Gucci. Menswear, which accounts for 29% of sales, was the strongest category with a 223% increase in revenue. Wholesale sales were up 14% while retail sales were ahead 20%, driven by new stores in cities including Milan. Retail space was up only 12%. A new 5,000sq ft store will open early next year in Moscow. Licensing sales climbed 15%. Burberry shares, which have gained 73% this year, closed down 15.25p at 382p. Analysts said the figures were good, but the shares were up with events."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
