The best known is Goyescas, the suite of piano pieces he composed between 1909 and 1912 and subtitled Los Majos Enamorados \u2013 \"the majos in love\" \u2013 inspired by the paintings of Goya. Granados later used the works as the basis of his opera of the same name. It's a substantial cycle. The six pieces last over 50 minutes, and though all of them are descriptive, programmatic almost, incorporating Spanish inflections such as popular songs and verse and dance forms, the style of the piano writing can be traced back to Chopin and Liszt. It's that side of Granados's music that is brought out in Garrick Ohlsson's technically immaculate performances. Other pianists might play up the music's nationalism, but it's the connection with the 19th-century mainstream Ohlsson emphasises. As an appendix, he also includes El Pelele, the \"Goyescan scene\" Granados composed in 1913, and a much earlier Concert Allegro in which the Lisztian connection is obvious."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
