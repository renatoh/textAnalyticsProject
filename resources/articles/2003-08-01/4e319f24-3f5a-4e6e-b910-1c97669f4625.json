The Wiltshire trainer runs the three-year-old in Saturday's Dubai Duty Free Sprint at Ascot and the following day he makes a three-pronged attack in Ireland and France. Three Valleys (Phoenix Stakes) and Deportivo (Listed race) go to the Curragh, while Avonbridge takes in the Prix Maurice de Gheest at Deauville. Move It, poorly drawn when well behind Deportivo at Royal Ascot, bounced back to form next time out at Newmarket where he beat Baltic King by one length in the six-furlong Tote Exacta Rated Handicap. Everything is going right for Charlton and Three Valleys will harden in next year's 2,000 Guineas betting if he continues his brilliant run in the Phoenix Stakes. Rated \"the best I have trained\" by Charlton, the two-year-old looks a very exciting prospect, zooming home by eight lengths in the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot. \"I believe Three Valleys to be a very exceptional horse,\" said the trainer. \"He is very exciting; there is no doubt he has improved since Royal Ascot. He has done well in every respect. \"I doubt there'll be many runners and it will be interesting to see what Aidan [O'Brien] runs. Three Valleys has the most wonderful action and fast ground suits him.\" One horse unlikely to be in opposition, though, is fellow Royal Ascot winner Russian Valour, who landed the Norfolk Stakes. \"I'm not absolutely sure at this stage, but the Irish race will probably come too soon and he's more likely to go for the Gimcrack (at York on August 20), which gives us that bit more time,\" Mark Johnston said. The Middleham trainer can do very little wrong at present and those who follow the horses for courses theory will no doubt be backing his Mana d'Argent at Ascot on Saturday. The six-year-old has gained all his five successes at the Berkshire track and goes for the six-timer in the Sodexho Shergar Stayers Cup Handicap. Today's racing is a far cry from the weekend fare, but La Vie Est Belle (4.15) can build on a promising run last time to land the Sky Bet Maiden Auction Fillies' Stakes at Bath. Rod Millman's filly ran much better than her place of seventh suggests in the Weatherbys Super Sprint at Newbury. She was badly drawn but ran on well and was only four lengths behind the winner, If Paradise, and this afternoon's opposition is far less formidable. She looks the best bet of the day. Barry Hills's horses are in tremendous form and the Lambourn trainer's Zeuss (3.15) can continue the run in the Skybet Vegas Rated Stakes. The three-year-old was disappointing when only eighth at Goodwood, but he was up against older horses and may have found the company a little too hot, especially as he was coming off a long lay-off. He started the season with a three-length victory over Coffee Time on the all-weather track at Lingfield and, now back in his own age group, can return to winning ways. David Loder's Anglo Saxon, who was reported to have breathing problems when disappointing at Sandown, could prove the biggest threat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
