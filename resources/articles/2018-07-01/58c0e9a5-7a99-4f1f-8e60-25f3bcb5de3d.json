What a day. After 10 hours we\u2019ve had only one completed match on Centre Court. We\u2019re hearing Djokovic and Nadal will most likely resume at 1pm tomorrow. Which would be harsh on Serena Williams and Angelique Kerber, given their final is due to start at 2pm. It would almost certainly be delayed. That\u2019s it for me, though. I\u2019m off to recover before tomorrow. I suggest you do the same. Bye! Nadal is absolutely furious. He plays a half-volley drop shot but Djokovic is wise to it and dispatches the winner from a tight angle. 10-9 Djokovic. This set point is on his serve. A war of attrition follows, and Nadal surrenders by netting! \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we have reached the 11 o\u2019clock deadline,\u201d announces the umpire. \u201cPlay is suspended.\u201d The spectators boo but are soon cheering the players off court, who both acknowledge the crowd. Djokovic even signs a few autographs before taking his leave. Third-set tie-break: Djokovic 9-9 Nadal* ... Djokovic gets over-excited and misses the return by a mile! It\u2019s 11pm. And they\u2019re carrying on ... Third-set tie-break: Djokovic 9-8 Nadal* Three minutes to 11pm, I wonder what happens if the tie-break is going on then. Will they pull them off or is there any leeway with the council? Another drop shot and Nadal has a third set point at 8-7 on Djokovic\u2019s serve. Nadal can\u2019t land the return. 8-8. 9-8 Djokovic, his first set point of the breaker ... Third-set tie-break: Djokovic 7-7 Nadal* A bullet of a forehand from Nadal and here\u2019s another set point, this time on his serve at 7-6. He fiddles with his hair, shirt, nose and ears before serving. Djokovic\u2019s drop shot saves the second set point! 7-7. Third-set tie-break: *Djokovic 6-6 Nadal Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce. Unreturned serve. They\u2019re level at the second change of ends ... Third-set tie-break: *Djokovic 5-6 Nadal ... Djokovic snatches at a second-serve return but still leads 4-3. Nadal ups the intensity, frowning and growling, but Djokovic quietly dispatches the overhead for 5-3. Djokovic is flying around like Superman on the next point, jumping into his backhand, but a reverse drop shot from Nadal \u2013 who\u2019s right back on the baseline \u2013 and it\u2019s 5-4. They\u2019re back on serve! 5-5. 6-5 Nadal, after one of the points of the match so far. And that\u2019s saying something. It\u2019s set point .. Third-set tie-break: Djokovic 4-2 Nadal* Nadal secures the first point of the breaker on Djokovic\u2019s serve, but an error from the world No 1 and it\u2019s 1-all. Nadal\u2019s getting louder and louder on the next point, which he settles with a second overhead. 2-1 Nadal. Djokovic claims the next two points on his serve for 3-2. The next point reaches its climax with both players at the net; Nadal\u2019s forehand volley doesn\u2019t clear it. So it\u2019s 4-2 Djokovic at the changeover ... Third set: *Djokovic 6-4, 3-6, 6-6 Nadal (*denotes next server) Expletives in the press centre on the third point. Not because of anything bad; simply because of how good this is. Nadal knifes away a volley to end a breathtaking exchange. 30-15. 40-15. Two game points to take this to a tie-break. 40-30. Nadal takes the game when he has Djokovic on a piece of string, dragging his opponent backwards and forwards. Djokovic ends up on the grass. Third set: Djokovic 6-4, 3-6, 6-5 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Nadal somehow stays in the rally on the backhand side, and as soon as Djokovic switches to Nadal\u2019s forehand, Nadal does what Nadal does. Bam. At 30-all, Djokovic comes up with an ace. 40-30. Game, as Nadal balloons his backhand long. An impressive hold of serve from 0-30 down. That fanatic will to win, missing for much of the last two years, looks to be reappearing. Third set: *Djokovic 6-4, 3-6, 5-5 Nadal (*denotes next server) Tim Henman believes this set deserves to go to a tie-break. He may have a point, but given how many we saw earlier, those words may send a shudder down your spine. Nadal holds comfortably. Third set: Djokovic 6-4, 3-6, 5-4 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Djokovic double faults. It\u2019s the first of the evening from either player, such are the standards these two set. But that\u2019s the only blip in an otherwise solid service game. Nadal reaches for the forehand, which never looks like it\u2019s going to land in court, and Djokovic holds to 15. Third set: *Djokovic 6-4, 3-6, 4-4 Nadal (*denotes next server) Quite how Djokovic manages to slide like he does on the grass, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like he\u2019s playing on clay. The pair both show tremendous agility on the opening point, which goes Nadal\u2019s way. 15-0. 30-0. 30-15. 40-15. Game, when Djokovic\u2019s return clatters into the net. Nadal, looking so intense, immediately strides purposefully to the baseline to receive. Third set: Djokovic 6-4, 3-6, 4-3 Nadal* (*denotes next server) We\u2019re hearing the match will resume tomorrow (if it doesn\u2019t finish within the next 40 minutes) under the roof, because that\u2019s how the match started. But if both players agree for the roof to be opened, it will be. I\u2019m sure Nadal would like them to raise the roof (the players are already doing that figuratively right now) but Djokovic may not given the indoor conditions favour him. Djokovic holds. Third set: *Djokovic 6-4, 3-6, 3-3 Nadal (*denotes next server) Two unforced errors from Nadal and it\u2019s 0-30. He gets one point back and then restores parity with a serve out wide, which Djokovic gets the smallest of touches on. Nadal then moves to 40-30. And he finishes with a thunderbolt of a forehand down the line. Third set: Djokovic 6-4, 3-6, 3-2 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Djokovic sprints through on serve to love. And good to see Trump\u2019s been bumped off BBC1 for the tennis. Third set: *Djokovic 6-4, 3-6, 2-2 Nadal (*denotes next server) Despite the clock ticking past 10pm, the spectators are still out in force. I can\u2019t see whether the patrons in the Royal Box are still there. Bear Grylls was there earlier, perhaps he could teach the crowd some survival lessons about watching 10 consecutive hours of tennis. But I digress. Nadal pounds a forehand deep to Djokovic\u2019s right for the hold. Third set: Djokovic 6-4, 3-6, 2-1 Nadal* (*denotes next server) A game of cat and mouse on the second point. Djokovic prevails. This is their first meeting at Wimbledon since the 2011 final and it\u2019s been worth the wait. 30-0. 40-0. 40-15. Game. Third set: *Djokovic 6-4, 3-6, 1-1 Nadal (*denotes next server) What a ridiculous improvised overhead from Nadal on the spin and the rally isn\u2019t over there, they continue before Nadal eventually wins through. He deserved that point. 15-0. 30-0. 40-0, when Nadal biffs down the line and Djokovic nets. Game. Third set: Djokovic 6-4, 3-6, 1-0 Nadal* (*denotes next server) I think it\u2019s most likely this will be finished before the women\u2019s final tomorrow rather than after. I remember that happening several years ago, when MaliVai Washington defeated Todd Martin in their delayed semi-final before Steffi Graf beat Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the women\u2019s final. Nadal, meanwhile, briefly leaves the court between sets, before coming back to receive. Djokovic holds to 30. So Nadal is serving to level the match. Gasps on the opening point when Nadal\u2019s drop shot slumps into the net. The pair are moving each other left and right and left and right and left and right and left and right and left on the right on the second point - this is like 2012 all over again. The rally totals 17 shots, ending with a Nadal volley. 15-all. 30-15. 30-all. 30-40, break point, after another long exchange. These are the best moments of the match so far, quality-wise. Unreturned serve, deuce. Djokovic has some words for his box. Nadal misses with a forehand down the line. Advantage Djokovic, another break point. Deuce. Finally it\u2019s Nadal\u2019s advantage for his first set point. Djokovic\u2019s backhand skids into the tramlines and Nadal takes the set! Second set: Djokovic 6-4, 3-5 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Djokovic gets to 40-15 with a fine stop volley. A 91mph forehand from Nadal rocks him back to 40-30. But another touch volley and that\u2019s the game. Second set: *Djokovic 6-4, 2-5 Nadal (*denotes next server) A strong, strong hold from Nadal. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game. This is an enthralling match, it\u2019s such a shame they\u2019re unlikely to finish this evening. The 11pm curfew can\u2019t be broken, it\u2019s set by the local council. Second set: Djokovic 6-4, 2-4 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Neither player seems to fancy holding serve at the moment. Djokovic drops to 0-30. He just makes a forehand, which clips the outside of the sideline, but he\u2019s living dangerously. 15-30. 30-all. 40-30. Deuce, when he nets Nadal\u2019s return. Come the big moment, comes the ball bounce. Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce. \u201cIt drives me crazy how many times he bounces the ball,\u201d says Becker. And perhaps Djokovic has driven himself crazy, because it\u2019s Nadal\u2019s advantage, break point. Deuce. Nadal\u2019s advantage, a second break point. He lassos a forehand and Djokovic is caught in the noose. Nadal breaks! Second set: *Djokovic 6-4, 2-3 Nadal (*denotes next server) A quite fantastic third point, Nadal is stretching and sliding and spinning before Djokovic puts him out of his misery with a lob. 15-40, two break-back points. Djokovic chops a forehand, Nadal cracks it back, but Djokovic crunches it past Nadal with interest. Djokovic breaks straight back! \u201cIn a moment of crisis he attacks,\u201d says Becker. Second set: *Djokovic 6-4, 1-3 Nadal (*denotes next server) At 15-30, Djokovic drags an errant forehand well wide! He didn\u2019t need to go for the shot that much. So Nadal has his first break points of the match. And he strikes on the first! Nadal breaks, very much against the run of play. Djokovic will be disgusted with himself. Second set: *Djokovic 6-4, 1-2 Nadal (*denotes next server) Djokovic has been missing in action for much of the last two years. He hasn\u2019t won a grand slam since the French Open in 2016, when he completed a career slam and held all four titles at the same time. But it\u2019s fair to say the real Novak Djokovic is standing up here. The wall is back. Nadal just can\u2019t hit through him. Djokovic has a break point at 30-40 and another at his advantage. He screams at himself after missing the second, the first sign of frustration from him. Given the way he\u2019s been raging at everything and everyone this fortnight, he\u2019s been fairly calm this evening. Nadal gets a spade out of his bag and digs himself out of a hole to hold. Wonder what the Wimbledon ground staff will say about that. Second set: Djokovic 6-4, 1-1 Nadal* (*denotes next server) A good omen for Djokovic: apparently 44 of the 51 matches between these two have been won by the player who took the first set. A ridiculous point at deuce, when Djokovic has to smash the ball again and again and again and again before settling matters. Advantage Djokovic. Boris Becker, Djokovic\u2019s former coach, is on the BBC commentary and admits the overhead is not the Serb\u2019s finest shot. \u201cNothing worked, we tried everything [to improve it],\u201d Becker laughs. Second set: *Djokovic 6-4, 0-1 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal, having needed nearly five hours to see off Del Potro in the quarter-finals, perhaps isn\u2019t as physically fresh as Djokovic but there\u2019s no doubt the conditions are also favouring Djokovic this evening. The ball isn\u2019t bouncing as high as it was earlier when it was warmer. That not only means Nadal\u2019s top-spin is less vicious, it also means he\u2019s having to bend down a little lower on the grass with his creaking knees. Nadal stumbles at the start of the second set, going 30-40 down on serve. But he\u2019s fist pumping and vamosing after saving the break point. Deuce. Advantage Nadal. A second deuce. A second advantage Nadal. Game Nadal. An attritional first point, they\u2019re both hitting so deep and true, and Djokovic takes it. 15-0. 30-0. A fifth ace, 40-0. Three set points. Just the one will do. Djokovic secures the set under the Friday night lights with a fizzing forehand winner! Having been made to wait \u2013 and wait \u2013 and wait \u2013 to get on court, he doesn\u2019t seem to want to hang around here. First set: *Djokovic 5-4 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal picks a good time for his first love hold. But he\u2019s now going to have to find a way to break Djokovic for the first time to keep this set going for more than one more game. First set: Djokovic 5-3 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Djokovic backs up the break with very little fuss. 15-0. 30-0. 40-0. 40-15. Game. It\u2019s over to Nadal to hold serve to stay in the opening set ... First set: *Djokovic 4-3 Nadal (*denotes next server) Ooohs and aaahs on the opening point, followed by rapturous applause. No disrespect to Anderson and Isner, they both left everything on the court earlier, but the crowd are loving these early exchanges. At 0-30 on Nadal\u2019s serve, Djokovic thinks he\u2019s won the point for three break points, but his effort is called out. Hawk-Eye reveals it was a blade or two of grass in! 0-40. 15-40. Djokovic\u2019s return is too hot to handle and Djokovic claims the first break! First set: Djokovic 3-3 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Djokovic has been pushing in Nadal\u2019s service games and now it\u2019s Nadal\u2019s turn to apply a bit of pressure. Deuce. But an unreturned serve and winner later, and it\u2019s Djokovic\u2019s game. Tomorrow\u2019s intended order of play, but it depends on whether this match gets finished tonight. Which seems unlikely unless it\u2019s straight sets. Which seems unlikely given these two. First set: *Djokovic 2-3 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal is under pressure at 15-30. Pah, what pressure. He pulls off a delicate drop shot. But then flaps at the smash! 30-40. Break point. Djokovic rams his return into the net off Nadal\u2019s second serve. The Serb will be angry he didn\u2019t get that back into play. Deuce. The longest rally of the match, 14 shots, and Djokovic is the victor. Advantage Djokovic, a second break point. Deuce. Advantage Nadal. And it\u2019s Nadal\u2019s game when he gets a drop shot back with the help of a lucky net cord. First set: Djokovic 2-2 Nadal* (*denotes next server) A measure of how well Nadal is playing this tournament: Andy Murray said the world No 1\u2019s fifth set against Juan Martin del Potro was one of the best sets of tennis he\u2019d ever seen. And a measure of how well Djokovic is playing: Murray said a few days ago he wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if Djokovic won the title. Murray\u2019s BBC commentary was excellent during the quarter-finals. Fingers crossed he\u2019ll do it again sometime, but Murray probably hopes it\u2019ll be later rather than sooner as he\u2019d rather be back on court. Meanwhile on this court, Djokovic holds to 15 when Nadal\u2019s return goes a foot or so long. First set: *Djokovic 1-2 Nadal (*denotes next server) Credit to both players for the way they\u2019ve come out after being locked up in the locker room for so long. Nadal looks comfortable at 30-0 but Djokovic drags himself to 30-all. 40-30 then becomes deuce; Nadal just can\u2019t shake Djokovic off. Nadal looks vulnerable to a cross-court pass but Djokovic opts to go down the line and Nadal pings away a winning volley. Advantage Nadal. Deuce. Advantage Nadal. Game Nadal. First set: Djokovic 1-1 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Nadal will no doubt be pleased that this semi-final has made it on to court today but the roof does not favour him. He\u2019s not beaten Djokovic indoors in eight years. Djokovic gets his side of the scoreboard moving with a straightforward hold. First set: *Djokovic 0-1 Nadal (*denotes next server) So seven hours after the first semi-final started, the second semi-final is finally under way. And this one could go on for a while too. Exhibit A: the 2011 US Open final. Four hours and 10 minutes. Exhibit B: the 2013 French Open semi-final. Four hours and 37 minutes. Exhibit C: the 2012 Australian Open final. Five hours and 53 minutes. The pair share the opening two points, before Djokovic edges ahead for 30-15. Nadal charges back for 30-all, 40-30. Djokovic is on the attack on game point, and the approach pays off. Deuce. After a 50-game final set between Anderson and Isner, let\u2019s just hope this match doesn\u2019t start with 50 deuces. Nadal hears the plea, and wins the next two points for an opening hold. Anderson v Isner wasn\u2019t the only marathon this evening. Just before Anderson\u2019s victory, in the boys\u2019 singles semi-final, Britain\u2019s 16-year-old Jack Draper defeated Colombia\u2019s Nicolas Mejia 19-17 in the final set on his 10th match point after four hours and 24 minutes. Draper is trying to become Britain\u2019s first champion in the boys\u2019 event since 1962. Jamie Murray and Victoria Azarenka, meanwhile, are through to the mixed doubles final. It would be understandable if Nadal had been thrown a little by these unusual circumstances. But not at all. He sticks to his usual routine. Jumping up and down at the net during the coin toss? Check. The bull-like charge to the baseline? Check. The lining up of the water bottles? Check. So he\u2019s ready for the warm-up. So after the longest semi-final in Wimbledon history, the longest match on Centre Court and the second longest grand slam match of all time, are you ready for more tennis? Sure you are. The roof is on, so Nadal and Djokovic can play until 11pm under the lights. That\u2019s the curfew. They\u2019re wasting no time; they\u2019re both already on court. What a lesson in perseverance from Anderson. Not only today over six hours and 35 minutes but also in his career. It took him nine years to reach his first grand slam final; he\u2019s now made two in 10 months. But what shape will he be in for the final? He played a 13-11 fifth set against Federer in the quarter-finals too. They\u2019ll probably have to bring him on to court on a stretcher on Sunday. Katy here, Bryan has gone for a deserved lie-down. Anderson didn\u2019t even smile after completing the win, he was too exhausted. He looks like the walking dead for the off-court interview but speaks fairly eloquently given the circumstances: I don\u2019t really know what to say right now. It\u2019s really tough on both of us. At the end, I feel like it\u2019s a draw between the two of us but someone has to win. John\u2019s such a great guy. I apologise if I\u2019m not more excited right now but I\u2019ve got so many mixed emotions. All I can say is congratulations to John on such a great tournament. Hopefully he can come back stronger. I really hope this a sign for grand slams to change this format. For us to be out there for that amount of time, I really hope we can address this. But at the same time I\u2019m through to the final. I\u2019m definitely going to have to recover as much as I can. It\u2019ll take a long time to process what\u2019s happened today but I\u2019m into the final and that\u2019s a dream come true. Here\u2019s a snap report on today\u2019s marathon. Now I\u2019ll tag out to the inestimable Katy Murrells, who will take you through the aftermath and run-up to Nadal v Djokovic. Naturally, Anderson falls behind love-15. An extended rally on the next point but Anderson cuts it short by coming to net and a wilting Isner misfires badly on the passing shot. Anderson hits a 130mph ace, his 49th of the match, for 30-15. Then an unreturnable serve and Anderson has a pair of match points. And he needs only one! Isner mishits early in the rally and the match is over after 6hr 35min! Kevin Anderson becomes the first South African to reach a Wimbledon final in 97 years! Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 25-24 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner falls behind love-30 for a fourth straight service game. This must be it. And it just may be: Anderson rips a forehand winner for triple break point! Isner saves the first with a serve-and-volley winner, but he\u2019s sent scrambling along the baseline on the next point and dumps a backhand into the net for the long-awaited break of serve! Can Anderson land the plane? Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 24-24 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson holds at love. Cool. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 23-24 Isner (*denotes next server) The weary Isner finds himself down love-30 for a third straight service game. Predictably, the American answers with four quick points in succession to hold for 23-all. What was hope? Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 23-23 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson keeps step with Isner, capping the love hold with a pair of aces for 23-all. The South African has hit 114 winners against 22 unforced errors compared to 128 and 56 for the American. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 22-23 Isner (*denotes next server) For the second straight service game Isner falls behind love-30. Surely this must be it. Isner pulls back one on a successful challenge, then another when Anderson can\u2019t adjust to a bad bounce and sprays a backhand wide. We\u2019re at 30-all. Another Anderson mishit sets up an elementary forehand winner for Isner from the middle of the court and he\u2019s out with the hold moments later. Oh. Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 22-22 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson wins the opening point but Isner comes to net and wins a marvelous point showing deft touch for 15-all. But from there Anderson rattles off three quick points for the hold. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 21-22 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner misfires on a groundstroke then double-faults for love-30 and the crowd leans forward. Could this be it? Er, no. He levels with a pair of aces. Moments later they\u2019re at deuce, only for Isner to dig out another two points behind that formidable serve. A great escape and the pressure is back on Anderson. Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 21-21 Isner* (*denotes next server) Isner gets it to 40-30 on Anderson\u2019s serve and the crowd buzzes, but he\u2019s just off on a forehand from the baseline and the South African holds once more. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 20-21 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner holds. Time is a flat circle. Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 20-20 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson holds at love and we\u2019re officially into the seventh hour. This is certainly something. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 19-20 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner breezes through another service game. Still a long way off from Isner-Mahut, but the record for the longest bare-knuckle prizefight was the 1855 bout between James Kelly and Jonathan Smith fought near Fiery Creek, Victoria, Australia. That took 6hrs 15mins and we\u2019re only a quarter-hour from there ... Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 19-19 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson wins the opening point, his 100th winner of the match compared to 20 unforced errors, then proceeds to hold once again, easily. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 18-19 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner holds. Maybe someone should let these guys know they\u2019re not being paid by the hour. Meanwhile, the rain clouds are looking more and more ominous ... Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 18-18 Isner* (*denotes next server) A stress-free hold for Anderson and we\u2019re on to the 37th game of this fifth and deciding set, though there hasn\u2019t been much of the latter to speak of. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 17-18 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner falls behind 15-30, then misfires on a forehand and suddenly Anderson has a pair of break-point chances which, decidedly, feel like match points. Isner brushes aside the first with a 118mph ace, then another with a 125mph missile. Oh wow. Moments later he\u2019s escaped with the hold, capping the game with a nifty cross-court backhand winner from a tight angle. Just when I thought I was out ... Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 17-17 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson holds at love. Seventeen-all. The players have been on court for 5hr 42min, which is enough time to watch all three Back to the Future movies. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 16-17 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner holds. Quite easily. We are beyond good and evil. Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 16-16 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson holds at love, capping it with his 36th and 37th aces of the match. Sixteen-all. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 15-16 Isner (*denotes next server) A comfortable, drama-free hold for Isner and we\u2019re moving on. At 5hr 33min, this is officially the second-longest match in the history of the championships and the longest single-day match. Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 15-15 Isner* (*denotes next server) As rain clouds loom ominously in the vicinity of the All England Club, Anderson races out to 40-love before flubbing a forehand from the baseline for a rare unforced error, only his 18th of the match (compared to an eye-popping 94 winners). Now Isner hits another winner and there\u2019s a glimmer of hope at 40-30. It\u2019s quickly snuffed out, though, when Isner misses on a passing shot down the line. Fifteen-all. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 14-15 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner wins the first point of the game but Anderson disguises a beautiful inside-out forehand winner that drops into the corner for 15-all. Isner answers with a 131mph ace, then another blazing first serve that Anderson can\u2019t return into the court. Another ace and Isner noses ahead, putting the pressure squarely back on the South African. Reader CB Page chimes in, via email: Never mind Isner v Anderson - Gordon Reid and Alfie Hewett just beat Gustavo Fernandez and Shingo Kunieda in a titanic 2hr 48min battle for the Men\u2019s Wheelchair Doubles! Can they win their third consecutive Wimbledon? I think so! Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 14-14 Isner* (*denotes next server) Stress-free hold for Anderson, who levels at 14-all. Another record tumbles as the match reaches the 5hr 19min mark, making it the longest match in the history of Centre Court. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 13-14 Isner (*denotes next server) \u201cGet a shift on, we want to see Rafa!\u201d shouts a spectator, prompting a stern warning from the chair umpire. Anderson gets it to 40-30 and the crowd swells, but Isner is bailed out by his serve again and holds for 14-13. Meanwhile, reader Greg Phillips emails to say this match is about to break another record, specifically for most games in a Wimbledon semi (Ivanisevic v Krajicek, 1998: 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-7 (5-7), 15-13). Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 13-13 Isner* (*denotes next server) Two quick points for Anderson. Isner pulls back a point with a volley winner, but Anderson answers with aces of 125mph and 108mph for the hold. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 12-13 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner races out to 40-15 before Anderson pulls another return winner from his pocket to make him think about it at 40-30. But he doesn\u2019t think long, sealing the hold on with another successful serve-and-volley. Can Anderson keep pace? Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 12-12 Isner* (*denotes next server) They\u2019ve played 5hr 6min when Anderson steps to the line for the 24th game of this fifth set, which means they only need to play another five hours to surpass that match. Three quick points for the South African before he misfires on a backhand from the baseline for 40-15. No matter. He pounds a forehand winner on the next point for the hold. Predictably, the calls for a fifth-set tiebreaker at Wimbledon are rising. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 11-12 Isner (*denotes next server) A serve-and-volley by Isner and he wins the point with a feathery volley into a wide-open court. He follows it with an ace and Anderson accomodates with an error for 40-love. Then he dials in an unreturnable serve and Isner has the straightforward hold. We\u2019re officially into the sixth hour ... Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 11-11 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson falls behind love-15 but rattles off three quick points before pounding a forehand winner from behind the baseline for the hold. Eleven-all. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 10-11 Isner (*denotes next server) Squeaky bum time for Isner as Anderson rips a pair of winners for love-30, but he hits back with an 118mph ace and a forehand winner on the approach for 30-all. Now Isner dumps a backhand into the net and Anderson will have a break point that has the feel of a match point, but he badly frames a shot from the baseline for deuce. From there Isner thuds a 112mph ace and a marvelous winner on the run for the hold in stride en route to the chair for the changeover. Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 10-10 Isner* (*denotes next server) Isner passes Anderson on the opening point, a shot the South African could have returned but he must have thought it was going to go long. Love-15. He rallies for three quick points then he mixes in a double fault, his fourth of the match, for 40-30. But he crushes an ace for the hold. Both men are looking slightly more vulnerable in their service games, by today\u2019s standards anyway, so another 70-68 match feels unlikely. We think. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 9-10 Isner (*denotes next server) We\u2019ve reached the 4hr 45min mark, making it the longest Wimbledon semi-final ever played (surpassing the 2013 match between Novak Djokovic and Juan Martin del Potro). And more than a glimmer of hope for Anderson here as Isner falls behind love-30, but he wins the next two points then crushes a 129mph for game point. A volley winner at the net gives him the hold and Anderson will serve to stay in the tournament after the chanegover. Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 9-9 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson, now faltering a bit on his first serve, is pushed to 40-30. He then blinks first in an extended baseline rally for deuce and the crowd swells. But the South African responds with a 129mph ace followed by an unreturnable serve to escape with the hold and we\u2019re level at nine-all. No word on whether this will be settled by the fair-play tie-breaker. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 8-9 Isner (*denotes next server) \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to be 70-68, John!\u201d yells a spectator between points and Isner flashes a brief smile. He then races through another service game, capping it with a powerful forehand winner on the approach, and the pressure shifts back to Anderson. Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 8-8 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson closes out a love hold with a thudding ace. Lots of reader emails asking whether the second semi-final between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic will be played under the roof due to the length of this match. We\u2019re told the BBC have just confirmed it will be. Fifth set: Anderson* 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 7-8 Isner (*denotes next server) A rally in the first point ratchets up excitement as Anderson takes it for 0-15. Isner then gets done by a superb return that he cannot keep in. 0-30 and on his second serve he gets to the net to begin his salvage job. A fine serve makes it 30-30 to dampen the fervour. And suddenly, a break point for Anderson with a clattered forehand that Isner cannot stop. Isner makes it deuce, the first of the set, with his own dangerous weapon. Isner serves to claim an advantage. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he shouts, as he claims the hold! This is fraying, but no end in sight yet. Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 7-7 Isner* (*denotes next server) The way this is going, the World Cup final will not be clashing with the men\u2019s final. Anderson smashing the serves down like Glenn McGrath bowling medium-fast at his precision best. He surges to 40-0 and then game point. The treadmill rolls on and on and here come new balls/ Fifth set: Anderson *7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 6-7 Isner (*denotes next server) The serves not quite as dead-eyed, and the odd point being won, but not enough to stop the treadmill of service holds. Isner looks tired but he got to 40-15, and then served it out. Back we go again... Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 6-6* Isner (*denotes next server) An error from Isner at the net for the first point but his next serve, hit slower, foxes Isner into netting. Isner punches one into the back of the court to take it to 15-30. A chance? 30-30 comes after Isner cannot keep Anderson\u2019s volley in. Similar happens to make it 40-30 and then a booming serve to the corner is unstoppable. Fifth set: Anderson* 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 5-6 Isner (*denotes next server) A great service return for 15-15 from Anderson but serve and volley makes it 30-15 to Isner. Anderson looks tired on his next return but an error takes it to 40-30. The first deuce of the set is yet to happen, though, as a guided missile wins the game. Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 5-5* Isner (*denotes next server) Anderson requires a second serve on the first point but Isner cannot get it in. Isner next whacks the ball out for 30-0. A wild shot from Anderson brings it to 30-15 but a slip by Isner makes it 40-15. Next up, the merest whiff of a rally and Isner is sent the wrong way to win the game. Fifth set: Anderson* 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 4-5 Isner (*denotes next server) And, yes, Isner serves that one out to 15. Now, can he break Anderson? Seems unlikely at this stage. Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 4-4 Isner* (*denotes next server) Rather troublingly, John McEnroe has pointed out that breaking serves is harder the longer a game goes on. Some talk of moving Nadal and Djokovic to another court. We are past the four-hour mark. 40-0 comes along quickly and game to Anderson wins the game. Fifth set: Anderson* 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 3-4 Isner (*denotes next server) There was actually a rally there, but at 40-15 but the next point was another bludgeoned service winner. Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 3-3 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson sidles into a 30-0 lead. Then makes it a 40-0 lead, and, yes, you know the rest. Isner actually got a bit of string on the final one, but no avail. If these two are finished by then, Centre Court beckons tomorrow for Serena Williams. Fifth set: Anderson* 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 2-3 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner wins the first then Anderson flukes the next point. The second serve and winner are brutal for 30-15. The next serve is the same, and so is the next. This one feels like an unbreakable pattern of serving destruction. Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 2-2 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson launches a bomb to win the first, then Isner drills a forehand return to make it 15-15. It goes to 30-15 when Isner overhits a lobbed backhand, and he does the same on the next point to make it 40-15. The next serve offers no chance. Fifth set: Anderson* 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 1-2 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner made short work of that service game to go back into the lead. Blink, and you missed it. Fifth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 1-1 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson hits a 133mph ace down the middle, then double-faults for 15-all. But he responds with three quick points for the hold. I\u2019ll be stepping away for a quick spell, but you\u2019ll be in good hands with John Brewin. Fifth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 0-1 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner opens the fifth with three straight aces followed by a thunderous serve out wide that Anderson can\u2019t return into the court. Love hold. Fourth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4 Isner Anderson races to 40-love for triple set point, but Isner saves the first, then the second, then the third for deuce. Oh boy. Anderson comes to net on his next serve and puts away an easy volley winner for a fourth set point and this time he makes the most of it, crushing a serve down the middle that a flailing Isner can only return into the net. Set to Anderson and we\u2019re headed to a fifth and deciding set! Fourth set: Anderson *7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 5-4 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner plays a few loose points on his serve and quickly finds himself break point down at 30-40. He faults and then serves-and-volleys on his second serve, but Anderson rips a backhand cross-court winner for the break! The South African will serve to force a decider after the changeover! Isner became the first man to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals without dropping serve since records began in 1992, but he\u2019s been broken three times today by Anderson and the third could prove vital. Fourth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 4-4 Isner* (*denotes next server) Stress-free hold for Anderson. Four-all in the fourth. Fourth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 3-4 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner double-faults twice and suddenly it\u2019s 30-all, but he crushes an ace out wide and Anderson can\u2019t capitalize on a passing opportunity and Isner\u2019s held again. Fourth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 3-3 Isner* (*denotes next server) Isner pounces on a second serve and hits a forehand winner down the line, but Anderson responds with a winner of his own for 15-all. Then the American hits a forehand winner set up by a marvelous backhand for 15-30, but Anderson thuds a 132mph ace out wide for 30-all. Now Anderson sprays a forehand wide (challenged unsuccessfully) to give Isner a break point ... and he capitalizes! Isner hits a backhand winner to pass the fast-approaching Anderson with pinpoint accuracy to break back and deny Anderson the consolidation. We\u2019re back on serve in the fourth. Fourth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 3-2 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner mixes in a few errors, Anderson hits a blistering return winner and suddenly they\u2019re at deuce. Another ripping winner off the return and the South African will have a precious look at a break point. And he\u2019s done it with another return winner down the line for a break of serve! Fourth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 2-2 Isner* (*denotes next server) Another game, another easy hold, this time for Anderson. We seem bound for another tie-break ... Fourth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 1-2 Isner (*denotes next server) Another hold at love for Isner, who\u2019s dialed in on his serve (as has been the case for much of the fortnight). He\u2019s eight-for-eight on his serve this set. Fourth set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 0-1 Isner* (*denotes next server) Isner gets a sniff when Anderson falls behind love-15, but the South African rattles off three quick, short points off big serves. Isner pulls one back when Anderson tries and fails to lob him and the American puts it away with an overhand smash winner, but Anderson earns the hold with an ace. Fourth set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-7, 0-1 Isner (*denotes next server) After a seven-and-a-half-minute spell between sets, Isner opens the fourth with a breezy love hold. John Isner is one set from a Wimbledon final. What is life. Right now Anderson has taken a medical timeout and is being treated by a trainer and a doctor while Isner, who saved a pair of set points in that last tie-breaker, has left the court for a bathroom break. Right, I\u2019m going to take a break. Bryan\u2019s here to take over. See you later ... ... but no, Isner only needs another couple of points. He serves his way to 10-9, now he\u2019s receiving ... and Anderson blinks! Isner has come from one tie-break down to lead by two two-breaks to one! He\u2019s only one tie-break from a place in the Wimbledon final! Third set tie-break: Anderson 9-9 Isner* Anderson goes long and Isner has set point at 7-6 on his own serve! Isner opts to serve and volley, and a few shots later Anderson comes up with the passing winner! 7-7. And this time it\u2019s Anderson\u2019s turn to have a set point on serve at 8-7. Anderson nets his first serve ... and his second is called long! Hawk-Eye confirms the double fault. 8-8. 9-8 Anderson, a second set point for the South African. Isner serves ... and Anderson isn\u2019t getting that back. 9-9. Maybe after his 70-68 final set against Mahut, Isner\u2019s going for another record with a 70-68 tie-break? Third set tie-break: *Anderson 6-6 Isner And from 2-0 down, Anderson goes 4-3 up, courtesy of a brilliant backhand, only his second winner on that side today. But Isner cancels out the mini-break with a winner of his own. 4-4. 5-4 Anderson, 5-5 after a tremendous half-volley from Isner. Some rat-a-tat at the net and Isner has his arms raised, he\u2019s got a set point on Anderson\u2019s serve at 6-5. Anderson dismissess the danger and they switch ends again ... Third set tie-break: Anderson 3-3 Isner* Anderson frames a forehand so high on the first point that it probably lands on Wimbledon Common. 1-0. 2-0 Isner. \u201cI\u2019ve got a feeling Isner thinks this is his destiny, he\u2019s going to win the tournament,\u201d says John McEnroe. Steady, John. Remember who\u2019s playing next. And Anderson, stretching every sinew of his 6ft 8in frame, comes up with a winning return to put it back on serve. 2-1, 2-2, 3-2 Anderson, 3-3 as they change ends ... Third set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-6 Isner (*denotes next server) A double fault from Isner, his third of the match, and it\u2019s 30-all. A crunch moment. So Isner comes up with a crunching serve. 142mph, his fastest of the match. His next is a meagre 125mph. Game. Third set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 6-5 Isner* (*denotes next server) Both players appear to have had their fun for this set, so decide to revert to type as they both hold. And an email from Derrick Cameron entitled Deferred Gratification: \u201cImagine having tickets for the men\u2019s semi-final and having to watch this before Rafa v Novak. It\u2019s like having to eat a mountain of greens before any pudding.\u201d Third set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 5-4 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson advances to 30-15. Isner pegs him back to 30-all with a backhand passing winner down the line. Anderson was the first man to break Federer during the tournament, now he\u2019s the first man to break Isner. But he\u2019s in danger of being broken himself after the forehand error makes it 30-40. Isner is so aggressive on the break point, and strides forward to the net where he\u2019s victorious! After waiting nearly two and a half hours for a break, we\u2019ve had two in succession. Third set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 5-3 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner loses the opening point on his serve. And the third when a squash shot goes wrong. 15-30. 15-40, when Isner blazes wide! Anderson\u2019s box are on their feet. And everyone\u2019s on their feet after the next point, because Anderson improvises on the return, swerving out the way of the body serve to pull off the winner! After 110 consecutive service holds, Isner is broken! Anderson will serve for the set! Third set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 4-3 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson holds. Why don\u2019t they just cut to the chase, chalk off the next few games, and go straight to the tie-break? I\u2019m sure Nadal and Djokovic would approve. Third set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 3-3 Isner (*denotes next server) Confirmation that John Isner is a gentle giant: apparently he helped a ladybird off court during the second set. Sir David Attenborough, who\u2019s watching in the Royal Box, must have been pleased. Though I\u2019m not sure what the ladybird was thinking flying on to Centre Court with cannon fire all around. Another simple service game for Isner, who finishes things off with a volley. Third set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 3-2 Isner* (*denotes next server) \u201cCome on John,\u201d Big John says to himself as he slides 40-15 down on Anderson\u2019s serve. The talking about himself in the third person doesn\u2019t really help. Anderson rattles off the next point for the hold. Third set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 2-2 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner appears completely unaffected by his run-in with the umpire as he holds to love. Third set: Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 2-1 Isner* (*denotes next server) Isner has a chance at 30-all on Anderson\u2019s serve but he can\u2019t make the return. 40-30 Anderson. Game Anderson, when the giant hurtles forward and gobbles up the short ball. Isner exchanges a few words with the umpire at the changeover. \u201cThey\u2019ve done nothing,\u201d the American says. I think there was a suggestion he was receiving coaching from his box. Justin Gimelstob, one of Isner\u2019s coaches, is certainly being vocal, but I\u2019m not sure whether he\u2019s been simply offering encouragement or something more. Third set: *Anderson 7-6, 6-7, 1-1 Isner (*denotes next server) Anderson holds. Isner holds. Anyone wanting a few more rallies may wish to turn their attentions to Court 3, where Jack Draper is attempting to become the first British junior to reach a Wimbledon singles final since 2011. He\u2019s playing the Colombian Nicolas Mejia and it\u2019s going with serve, 2-all in the opening set. They\u2019ve already been playing for two hours and there are only two sets on the board. At this rate Nadal and Djokovic will have to come back tomorrow and provide the appetiser for the women\u2019s final. \u201cAt least Isner knows this is unlikely to be the longest game he\u2019s ever played in\u2026.\u201d points out Greg Phillips. Yes we\u2019ve still got around 160 games to go before the 70-68 encounter of 2010. 5-2, which turns into 6-2. But wait ... a Hawk-Eye challenge follows, incredibly the first of the match. And Isner\u2019s first serve was out! So it\u2019s a second serve and we\u2019re back to 5-2. Anderson\u2019s darting backhand down the line makes it 5-3. But it\u2019s too late. Isner brings up three set points at 6-3. Anderson rescues the first two on his own serve for 6-5 but Isner seals things \u2013 of course \u2013 with an ace! Second-set tie-break: *Anderson 1-5 Isner A strong return from Isner takes a bad bounce and Anderson is flummoxed. 2-0. And he takes the next point on Anderson\u2019s serve too, when he steps into the court with a rasping forehand winner. 3-0. Two successive points against serve, crazy scenes. Isner backs that up with two successive points on his own serve. 4-0. 5-0. 5-1 at the changeover ... Second set: Anderson 7-6, 6-6 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson holds to 30. So it\u2019s tie-break time. Again ... Second set: *Anderson 7-6, 5-6 Isner (*denotes next server) Peter Leybourne emails: \u201cIf Isner loses this match without being broken \u2013 has anyone in the history of tennis ever gone this deep into a tourney and, having never had their serve broken, NOT won the whole shebang?\u201d Well in 1991, Stefan Edberg, the defending champion and top seed, lost to Michael Stich in the semi-finals without being broken. The score was 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-2). Though I\u2019m not sure whether Edberg had dropped serve before the semi-final. Meanwhile, Isner holds for 6-5, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019d already guessed that. Second set: Anderson 7-6, 5-5 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson holds to 15. Anyone fancy another tie-break? Though I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m asking. It looks like we\u2019re getting one, even if you don\u2019t. Second set: *Anderson 7-6, 4-5 Isner (*denotes next server) Ho hum. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game Anderson. Neither player is able to tame their opponent\u2019s serve at the moment. But then, look, Isner narrowly misses the sideline with a volley! 30-all. Could Anderson be about to carve out a break point? Yes, as Anderson manages to dig Isner\u2019s slice out of the grass and produce the winner. 30-40, break point. Which is effectively a set point given how dominant the serve is in this encounter. Isner is in total control of the de facto set point and settles it by punching away the volley. Deuce. Advantage Isner. Game Isner. Come on guys, all we really want is a break ... Second set: *Anderson 7-6, 3-4 Isner (*denotes next server) Anderson isn\u2019t just a serving behemoth, you know. He lines up one of his huge forehands, unleashing a cross-court winner, on his way to a love hold. Isner\u2019s response? A love hold of his own, of course. Second set: *Anderson 7-6, 2-3 Isner (*denotes next server) Anderson takes the first point on Isner\u2019s serve. Which is about as much drama as we\u2019ve seen in this second set. Isner comes back at the South African and gets himself a 30-15 lead. An ace down the T makes it 40-15. Anderson, all 6ft 8in of him, shows some great agility to sprint to the net. 40-30. Deuce. Isner is muttering to himself. He looks a lot more content when Anderson nets the return. Advantage Isner. Another unreturned serve later and Isner holds for the 678th sorry 104th consecutive time. Second set: Anderson 7-6, 2-2 Isner* (*denotes next server) This second set has very much been the calm after the storm of the first-set tie-break. Both are holding serve with such ease. Anderson takes his ace count to 11 en route to holding to 15. Second set: *Anderson 7-6, 1-2 Isner (*denotes next server) Nothing to see here as Isner holds to love. The treatment the American receives for a blister on his racket-playing hand at the changeover takes longer than the game did. Second set: Anderson 7-6, 1-1 Isner* (*denotes next server) Isner holds. Anderson holds. And fancy some first-set stats? Sure you do: ... Isner\u2019s backhand flops into the net. So Anderson has a set point, to add to the one he had a few games ago. A brief delay as one of the ballboys falls over and has to go off court for treatment. A long rally plays out on Isner\u2019s serve, and the American eventually nets a forehand! After one hour and three minutes, Anderson takes the first set of a semi-final that is exceeding expectations. First set tie-break: *Anderson 6-6 Isner ... Isner levels at 5-all, then scorches the grass with a 139mph ace to bring up his first set point. It\u2019s on Anderson\u2019s serve though. Anderson\u2019s first serve flies off the tape and goes wide. He lands his second serve to Isner\u2019s backhand, and then comes back at Isner on that side, before prevailing. Set point saved ... First set tie-break: Anderson 5-4 Isner* ... but Anderson gets the major-break back with a passing winner! A simple smash and a nerveless volley later and it\u2019s Anderson with the advantage ... First set tie-break: Anderson 2-4 Isner* The first three points go to the server, before Isner unleashes a ferocious forehand winner for 3-1. Normally we\u2019d call it a mini-break but with these two servers, it\u2019s more of a major-break. An unreturned Anderson serve and it\u2019s 3-2. 4-2 at the changeover when Anderson\u2019s return sails wide ... First set: *Anderson 6-6 Isner (*denotes next server) A 132mph serve bomb secures the game for Isner and takes us into the tie-break. The first set was always going to end this way. As will, most likely the second, third and fourth. Remember no tie-breaks in the fifth. We could. Be here. A while. First set: Anderson 6-5 Isner* (*denotes next server) Anderson and Isner do their best impersonations of Nadal and Djokovic with a 23-shot rally on the opening point. Anderson is victorious. And goes on to hold with ease. They\u2019re now only a game away from that inevitable tie-break. First set: *Anderson 5-5 Isner (*denotes next server) A strong, low return from Anderson flies right into the 6ft 10in Isner\u2019s shins. 0-15. Wow, a second-serve ace of 126mph. 15-all. 15-30, when Isner timidly nets. A glimmer for Anderson, perhaps. Which turns into a set point when Isner double faults for 30-40. Suddenly Isner, having had the upper hand for much of the set, is on the ropes. Remember, he\u2019s not been broken this fortnight. But he strikes back at Anderson with a 129mph second serve into the body which nearly breaks the South African into a million pieces. Deuce. Advantage Isner. Game Isner! First set: Anderson 5-4 Isner* (*denotes next server) 15-0. 30-0. 40-0. Game. Anderson sticks to the serving script and Isner must hold to stay in the set. Which I think we can comfortably say he will, given he\u2019s won 99 consecutive service games here. First set: *Anderson 4-4 Isner (*denotes next server) Anderson\u2019s fellow South African Gary Player is among those in the Royal Box this afternoon. Other names include Sir David Attenborough, Bjorn Borg, Mark Carney, Bear Grylls, Rod Laver, Timothy Peake and Anna Wintour. No sign of Donald Trump. Isner said the other day that he\u2019d \u201clove\u201d the US president to come and watch during his UK visit. Luckily for the rest of the Wimbledon patrons \u2013 and unluckily for the Queen \u2013 Trump is at Windsor Castle this afternoon. Anderson and Isner both hold with the minimum of fuss. First set: *Anderson 3-3 Isner (*denotes next server) Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow. Isner sends down his fastest serve of the day, 135mph, before holding to 15. They\u2019re tied at three games and four aces apiece; there\u2019s nothing to pick between them right now. First set: Anderson 3-2 Isner* (*denotes next server) There are a few empty seats at the moment. Perhaps the spectators are pacing themselves before Nadal v Djokovic. Arguably a smart tactic, given how long play could go on for today. Anderson avoids the marathon of his last service game by holding to 15. But he then calls for the trainer, who gives him some pills and a banana before scurrying off. First set: *Anderson 2-2 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner responds to the disappointment of that missed opportunity well, holding to 30, the highlight a delicate volley on the second point. First set: Anderson 2-1 Isner* (*denotes next server) ... Advantage Anderson. Isner clobbers a forehand winner for deuce. John McEnroe on the BBC commentary says he thinks this is the best receiving game he\u2019s ever seen from Isner. But the ninth seed still hasn\u2019t won the game. Another game point for Anderson, another great return from Isner. An eighth deuce. Advantage Anderson. And Anderson finally secures the game after 13 minutes when Isner\u2019s return loops long! Anderson puffs his cheeks out in relief; Isner will wonder what on earth he has to do to break the South African. First set: *Anderson 1-1 Isner Apparently the bookies were offering odds on the longest rally being 10 during this match. Which seems a little optimistic given the opening two games. But the players get close to that at 30-15, before Anderson nets. 30-all. 40-30, when Anderson pings a forehand winner down the line. Isner sees Anderson\u2019s forehand and raises it with an inside-out cross-court winner. Deuce. Advantage Isner, an early break point. Another intriguing rally plays out - don\u2019t they know who they are? - Isner pulls the trigger but goes long. Deuce. Advantage Isner, a second break point. Deuce. Advantage Anderson. Isner rifles a backhand winner down the line. Deuce. The American\u2019s striking the ball so well and a probing return gets him a third break point. Isner has a makeable volley to take the game but skews wide! Deuce. Advantage Anderson. Deuce, as the game clock hits 10 minutes ... First set: *Anderson 1-1 Isner (*denotes next server) Isner leads the tournament ace charts with 161 and sends down his first of the day before holding to 15. First set: Anderson 1-0 Isner* (*denotes next server) Ladies and gentlemen, Anderson will hold to love sorry serve first. But his first serve whistles wide and his second goes long! He then makes amends for the double fault with his first ace. 15-all. 30-15. Ace, 40-15. Game. No long rallies there. The pattern is already set. Isner says: \u201cIt\u2019s by far the best grand slam I\u2019ve ever played in my career, and I\u2019ve been playing for 11 years. From my very first practice \u2026 I knew I was in a good spot. Physically I\u2019ve felt awesome.\u201d Anderson says: \u201cI said at the beginning of the tournament, getting through to the quarters was a big goal of mine. But also putting myself in these positions where hopefully I\u2019m able to get another step forward and be playing on Sunday.\u201d Isner leads their head-to-head 8-3 but this is their first meeting at a grand slam. Anderson, last year\u2019s US Open finalist, has not beaten Isner in more than six years and is on a five-match losing streak against the American. These two go back a long way, to when they were playing college tennis in the US: So who holds the aces today? Well both of them, given the number they\u2019ve been serving this championships. Both play a similar game, there won\u2019t be too many surprises on that front. Slicing is a tactic that would work well for both of them, given the beanpoles struggle to bend down to the low bounce. The players step on court to a great reception. Anderson might not have expected that after taking out their hero in the quarter-finals. The weather could play a part in today\u2019s proceedings. There\u2019s a 40% risk of showers between 4pm and 8pm. That would favour Djokovic; he\u2019s a better indoor player than Nadal is. Boris Becker\u2019s on BBC2. He\u2019s asked what the key is in the match between Djokovic and Nadal. And he should know, being Djokovic\u2019s former coach: One of the most remarkable statistics about today\u2019s semi-finals: for the first time in the Open era at a grand slam, all four semi-finalists are aged over 30. Djokovic is 31, Nadal 32, Anderson 32 and Isner 33. Rafa\u2019s tent isn\u2019t quite as impressive: I wonder if the RF tent is still in The Queue. Perhaps the Federer superfan has packed up and gone home. Away from the men\u2019s semi-finals, there\u2019s an all-British clash of sorts in the mixed doubles today, as Jay Clarke and Harriet Dart play Jamie Murray and Victoria Azarenka for a place the final. Meanwhile Jack Draper plays in the boys\u2019 singles, he\u2019s the first Brit to reach the last four since Kyle Edmund five years ago. And Alfie Hewett is out of the men\u2019s wheelchair event, losing in straight sets to the defending champion, Stefan Olsson. And some possible post-match viewing: Strokes of Genius: Federer v Nadal. This documentary of the 2008 final is well worth watching if you have access to BBC iPlayer, even more so now we know there won\u2019t be a repeat this year. Some pre-match viewing: Some pre-match reading: The script had already been written before the tournament started. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal would meet in the Wimbledon final, 10 years after their extraordinary encounter of 2008. Dusan Lajovic, Lukas Lacko, Jan-Lennard Struff and Adrian Mannarino dutifully read their lines word for word, allowing Federer to reach the last eight without dropping a set. Dudi Sela, Mikhail Kukushkin, Alex de Minaur and Jiri Vesely did the same against Nadal. In the quarter-finals, Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro tore a few pages out of the script, pushing Nadal to five sets before losing in a stunning decider, but Kevin Anderson ripped it to shreds against Federer, coming from two sets and match point down to dethrone the defending champion. Oh Kevin, this isn\u2019t how it was meant to be! So instead of 2008 we\u2019ll have to make do with a repeat of the 2011 final between Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Well it\u2019s not an exact repeat because they play each other in the semi-finals today. But let\u2019s call it the de facto final, because whoever wins will be the overwhelming favourite against Anderson or John Isner on Sunday. Nadal has been getting his mojo back on grass this fortnight, while Djokovic has been getting his mojo back, full stop. This is the furthest Nadal has advanced at Wimbledon since 2011, while for Djokovic it\u2019s a first grand slam semi-final in nearly two years. The conditions this year, with the sun hardening the courts, have been kind on Nadal\u2019s knees; for Djokovic, it\u2019s his confidence and elbow that have been healed. Their rivalry is the most contested in the Open era \u2013 today will be their 52nd meeting but first at a major since 2015 \u2013 and the way they\u2019ve been playing, this could rival their great matches of grand slams past. As for Isner and Anderson, we know exactly what to expect from these two big friendly giants: aces, aces and more aces. The 6ft 10in Isner leads the charts with 161 this tournament, while the 6ft 8in Anderson has 123 to his name. Both are appearing in their first Wimbledon semi-final at the age of 33 and 32 respectively. And that brings us on to the great irony about Isner. Wimbledon is the tournament people most closely associate him with, after that 70-68 match against Nicolas Mahut in 2010, yet he\u2019d never enjoyed much success here previously, failing to get beyond the third round. Finally the American\u2019s getting the chance to be recognised for something other than being the marathon man. Isner\u2019s also tearing up the script. Play begins at: just after 1pm BST. Play will end: probably some time tomorrow, given Isner and Anderson\u2019s propensity for tie-breaks and Nadal and Djokovic\u2019s propensity for attritional tennis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
