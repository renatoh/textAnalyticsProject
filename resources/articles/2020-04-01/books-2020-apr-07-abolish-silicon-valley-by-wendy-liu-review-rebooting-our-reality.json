Liu grew up as a computing whiz-kid in Montreal and moved to San Francisco to develop software that aspired, a little tackily, to be \u201cTinder for advertisers\u201d. When her entrepreneurial scheme fizzled out she transferred to the London School of Economics to study inequality, which turned her into an evangelising radical. In her book, she attacks the depressing doctrine of \u201ccapitalist realism\u201d and its assumption that our current social and economic arrangements are unchangeable; with born-again zeal, she chastises her own \u201cpetty and narcissistic\u201d nature and even laments \u201cthe tragedy of the human condition\u201d. A bit excessive, surely, as a response to the failure of a startup? But as I read on, everything changed. We now have good reason to question the pursuits of the vaunted innovators with whom Liu consorted in California \u2013 the blissed-out cultists at Google, whose only worry is over \u201cthe wrong kind of sparkling water in the microkitchens\u201d, or the manic experts who specialise in \u201cenvisioning hyperplanes in n-dimensional space\u201d. As Liu came to see, techies like these were already living extraterrestrially, having opted out of the earthly, bodily necessities that currently weigh us down. A colleague of hers said he would happily volunteer to join Elon Musk\u2019s projected colony on Mars, the \u201cbackup\u201d planet for menaced humanity. \u201cYou know you can never come back,\u201d warned another of Liu\u2019s friends. \u201cI\u2019d work remotely,\u201d grinned the would-be Martian. Anecdotes like this made me understand Liu\u2019s disenchantment with her fellow programmers, and by the time I finished the book, my irritation about her own West Coast fads \u2013 her partiality for rides on Lyft scooters, her meals of quinoa washed down with kombucha \u2013 seemed trivial, or perhaps petty and narcissistic. I ended up admiring her idealism, sharing her outrage, and wondering whether her prescription for a revolutionary upheaval might not go far enough. Her agenda is not only political. She thought of her work in Silicon Valley as \u201ca stepladder to a higher plane of existence\u201d \u2013 a cosmological undertaking, even a religious quest. In Einstein\u2019s day, the pioneers of the new physics thought they were engaged in \u201cworld-building\u201d; Liu similarly remarks that designing a website opens a hole in the universe through which we can study its inner mechanics. Her experiments in coding would, she believed, confer on her \u201ca kind of immortality\u201d. What prompted her self-reappraisal was the need to step over homeless sleepers on the streets outside San Francisco\u2019s glassy, gleaming corporate palaces. Soon afterwards it dawned on her that all those abstract trips on hyperplanes were only of value to investors if they served as market research: the purpose of algorithms is to track and to reinforce our performance as consumers. Then came the election of Trump, Liu\u2019s realisation that her collaborators regarded data as just \u201csomething to trade\u201d, and her penitent retreat to LSE. Now she calls for \u201copen protocols and decentralised services\u201d, and wants secretive competition between developers to be replaced by \u201cdemocratic oversight and open collaboration\u201d. Liu\u2019s blueprint for a \u201csocialist media system\u201d may still sound impractical, but her emphasis on public space and the public good have an eerie resonance at present: who knows what changes might come when we creep out of our enforced solitude and reconstitute a functioning society? A German hackathon in late March, when 43,000 participants joined forces online to discuss ways of outwitting coronavirus, may be exactly what she had in mind. As Liu reviews her tech-obsessed adolescence, she describes a life spent in Plato\u2019s cave, that recess of illusion where people turn away from sunlit reality and amuse themselves by watching shadows cast on the wall by the fire they have kindled. She sees her youthful self as \u201ca solitary figure lit by the weary flicker of an LCD screen\u201d, and admits that she disparaged her young contemporaries \u2013 less driven, therefore less worthy \u2013 who spent their time at play \u201cout in the sunshine\u201d. Gradually, as Liu\u2019s values alter, a lyrical appreciation of the nature she ignored enters her book: she notices how the \u201cicy air\u201d of the Montreal winter \u201cbit like pinpricks\u201d to make \u201cevery breath sharp\u201d, and she watches enraptured as the sun dissolves feathery wisps of fog that curl under the Bay Bridge in San Francisco. Before the revolution there has to be a reawakening, or a resuscitation, and this happens here as Liu begins to live in her body rather than her digitised head. The metaphorical blue-sky thinking recommended by startup accelerators in Silicon Valley is no substitute for the blue sky itself, which will go on shining whether we are here to look at it or not. \u2022 Abolish Silicon Valley: How to Liberate Technology from Capitalism by Wendy Liu is published by Repeater Books (\u00a310.99)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
