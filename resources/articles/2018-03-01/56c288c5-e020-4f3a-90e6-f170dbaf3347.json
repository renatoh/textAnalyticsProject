John Kelly\u2019s unusual intervention came at the end of a week that saw the abrupt firing of Rex Tillerson and widespread speculation that national security adviser HR McMaster could be next. \u201cThe chief of staff actually spoke to a number of staff this morning, reassuring them that there were personnel changes \u2013 no immediate personnel changes at this time \u2013 and that people shouldn\u2019t be concerned,\u201d press secretary Sarah Sanders said. \u201cWe should do exactly what we do every day and that\u2019s come to work and do the very best job that we can. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\u201d She added: \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re focused on, and many of us have relayed that to other staffers that weren\u2019t part of that meeting. And we\u2019re going to continue to focus on having record success in this second year as we had in our first year. We fully expect to do that and we expect to do that as a staff and as a team.\u201d The West Wing revolving door has spun faster and faster in recent weeks. Rob Porter, Trump\u2019s staff secretary, Hope Hicks, his communications director, and a top economic adviser Gary Cohn have all departed in quick succession. Shortly after dismissing Tillerson as secretary of state and replacing him with Mike Pompeo, Trump told reporters: \u201cI\u2019m really at a point where we\u2019re getting very close to having the cabinet and other things that I want.\u201d Media reports have described the institutionalisation of chaos, as the purge threatens in all directions. On Wednesday the Axios website quoted an unnamed official as saying: \u201cThis is the most toxic working environment on the planet. Usually tough times bring people together. But right now this atmosphere is ripping people apart.\u201d A day later the Washington Post reported: \u201cThe mood inside the White House in recent days has verged on mania.\u201d The same Post article, citing multiple sources, said Trump had decided to oust McMaster, who succeeded the disgraced Michael Flynn as national security adviser. Sanders swiftly denied the report via Twitter on Thursday night. But on Friday she acknowledged that Trump had asked her to pass on the reassurance to McMaster rather than doing it himself. Sanders said: \u201cI spoke directly to the president last night. He asked me to pass that message along to General McMaster. I know the two of them have been in meetings today. Our focus is not on the news stories that a lot of you guys would like us to be focused on, but we\u2019re actually focused on what the American people want us to do, and that\u2019s to come here and do our jobs.\u201d Attempting to dismiss the rumours as mere palace intrigue, she added: \u201cGeneral McMaster is a dedicated public servant and he is here not focused on the news stories that many of you are writing but on some really big issues \u2013 things like North Korea, things like Russia, things like Iran. That\u2019s what he\u2019s doing and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to continue to be focused on every single day that we show up for work.\u201d McMaster may be living on borrowed time, however. His style is said to rile Trump, who feels he is being lectured, and there have reportedly been policy clashes over North Korea and the Iran nuclear deal. Tara Palmeri, a journalist at ABC News, tweeted that McMaster told her outside the West Wing on Friday afternoon: \u201cSarah set it straight yesterday. Everybody has got to leave the White House at some point.\u201d Asked whether he is leaving sooner rather than later, McMaster said only: \u201cI\u2019m doing my job.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
