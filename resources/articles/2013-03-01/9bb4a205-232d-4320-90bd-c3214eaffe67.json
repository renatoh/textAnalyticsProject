All three parties, spurred on by pressure group Hacked Off, backed the notion that newspapers would have to pay extra or exemplary damages for libel and breaches of privacy if they did not sign up to the approved regulator \u2013 and got amendments to the crime and courts bill through the House of Commons on Monday which would give the courts these powers. It was a major defeat for newspapers, which unanimously opposed the award of exemplary damages in the courts, and which have received legal advice from some of the country's most respected media barristers that the creation of a special class of damages is contrary to article 10 of the Human Rights Act, which protects freedom of speech. There is also deep concern among newspapers over a second set of clauses which would mean legal costs awarded against a newspaper even if it won its case. It is believed that the Tory peer Guy Black, who is also executive director of the Telegraph Media Group, is hoping to get some of these amendments changed or removed before a vote in the House of Lords on Monday, but his chances are deemed to be slim. Associated Newspapers is understood to be prepared to fight exemplary damages on principle and will take the issue to Europe at the first opportunity in the courts. Exemplary damages Newspapers say the protection against exemplary damages for those who sign up to the approved regulator has been significantly weakened by a sub-clause in the bill which allows the high court to award damages on top of a fine imposed by the regulator, a so-called double jeopardy. Another senior executive of a separate newspaper group said: \"The idea that you get sued by a Russian oligarch and he wins and instead of him getting \u00a3100,000, he gets \u00a3200,000 just because you are not part of a government club is completely wrong. \"You can't have one law for members of a club and another for non-members, that's just plain wrong.\" But However advocates of exemplary damages say newspapers are being hysterical, as damages can only awarded in extreme cases where a newspaper has \"shown a deliberate or reckless disregard of an outrageous nature for the claimant's rights. Costs The issue of costs being awarded against a newspaper is a nightmare scenario for publishers, with legal bills for libel often running to hundreds of thousands of pounds. Newspaper are incentivised to join the regulator with a clause which bars a judge from awarding costs against a newspaper. But newspaper lawyers who have been poring over the small print say this is immediately undone by another clause, which says that the judge can award costs if the \"issues raised by the claim could have been resolved\" by the arbitration unit. This would prompt the extraordinary scenario where a judge could award costs against a newspaper even if the person suing lost their case. Lawyers familiar with drafting these amendments claim this is a typographical error and the word the clause should have said \"issues raised by the claim could not have been resolved\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
