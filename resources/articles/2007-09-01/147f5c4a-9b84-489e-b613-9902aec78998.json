Was caught out in defence for both Tonga tries and rarely made an impact in attack with the ball in hand Paul Sackey 7 Two smartly taken tries and an improvement in defence, with one notable take of a high ball under intense pressure from the Tongans Mathew Tait 7 Anonymous in the first-half but prominent in the second as England started to offload in contact. The centre personifies the way forward Olly Barkley 5 Too similar to Wilkinson in temperament and style. Missed a drop-goal and his replacement, Andy Farrell, made a big difference Mark Cueto 6 Limited opportunities; fluffed one break when he failed to look outside but Tait scored immediately afterwards to get him off the hook Jonny Wilkinson6 Mixed match. Kicking was inconsistent, missed a tackle for the first try; marshalled the game well from set pieces, less so in broken play Andy Gomarsall 6 Hounded his opposite number at Tonga's scrums to help ease pressure; passed quickly and varied his options well Andrew Sheridan 6 Strong up front but he still needs to be seen more with the ball in hand if England are to break out of their attacking strait-jacket George Chuter 6 Consistent lineout throwing, if not all of them were absolutely straight, and he sometimes bounced around in the loose to good effect Matt Stevens 5 Tonga wheeled a few of England's scrums on his side and the set-piece improved when the captain Phil Vickery came on Steve Borthwick 6 England's kicking game was based on their set-piece dominance, but Tonga's lineout held up surprisingly well against the Bath man Ben Kay 7 Ran the lineout and was involved throughout in the loose; more like the player who helped win the 2003 World Cup than of late Martin Corry 6 Tonga's back row made the breakdown a real contest but he defended doggedly and helped force turnovers in his hour or so on the pitch Lewis Moody 8 Probably will not remember much after taking three bangs on the head but he was energetic and produced the offload of the night Nick Easter 7 Took the game to Tonga from the opening minute but had to strain for every yard as the hits rained in. Strained to good effect, though Replacements Andy Farrell for Barkley, 52 mins Phil Vickery for Stevens, 57 mins Lawrence Dallaglio for Corry, 65 mins Lee Mears for Chuter, 67 mins Danny Hipkiss for Sackey, 67 mins Peter Richards for Cueto, 73 mins Tonga Lilo; Tu'ifua, Hufanga (H Tonga'uiha, 60), Taione, Vaka (Havili, 67); Hola, Tu'ipulotu (Hehea, 67); S Tonga'uiha (Filise, 46-50; 55), Lutui (Taukafa, 66), Pulu, Vaki (Molitika, 61), Fa'aoso (Afeaki, 67), H T-Pole, N Latu (capt), F Maka.
