West Ham were 3-0 down following a lacklustre first-half display. \"The players were told they had two choices,\" the source said. \"They could either feel sorry for themselves or try and change the game by adjusting their attitude and beginning to press West Brom more. The spirit in the team has been good but [the manager] was not happy. [He] was calm but told them that if they did not improve they were out.\" Carlton Cole revealed after the game that Scott Parker had also given his team-mates a rousing speech that helped motivate them. Regarding Parker's intervention the source added: \"It was a surprise as Scott does not normally speak and the changing room can be quiet, which is a worry [of the manager's].\" Grant had previously shown the squad a league table consisting of their previous eight games, which places West Ham in the top half of the division, to boost positivity as the players' confidence is also an ongoing concern for the Israeli."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
