Can that have been achieved with digital trickery? Alternatively, did they have official permission to do it for real? The answer looks like no in both cases. And yet such is the trauma and fear that linger around this film like a gaseous vapour, that this stunt is hardly less shocking than the low-key implications that build up throughout the action. Working with a minuscule budget and restless, hand-held, close-up camerawork, Swedish film-maker Jesper Ganslandt has created an intimate psychological study of someone in a kind of personal hell. Olle Sarri plays Krister, a harassed-looking, dishevelled guy who is having, on the face of it, a straightforward bad day. He is a driving instructor, but is having to cancel lessons via the calls he takes incessantly on his Bluetooth. He is grumpy, reticent, stressed, with urgent personal things to get sorted before he can think about work. But examined more closely, his face is that of someone in some sort of denial, or shock. He is carrying on with the business of the day, but is ready to explode. Or is it that he has already exploded? The audience is at liberty to piece together what is happening, and allowed to do so cleverly that the final moments of the film \u2013 in which the title is fully explained \u2013 are almost unbearably shocking and moving. This is a difficult, painful film, and hardly for everyone. It left me in a gibbering foetal ball in a corner of the cinema foyer. But in Jesper Ganslandt, Sweden has a new star director."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
