The Greeks qualified as runners-up after a torrid display, in which they lost to an already eliminated Russia side apparently galvanised into salvaging some late pride from their campaign. Greece seemed to have trouble coming to terms with the fact that only a draw was required from the game, and went 1-0 down within two minutes of the kick off. Dmitry Kirichenko burst through the middle of the Greek defence and calmly shot past keeper Antonis Nikopolidis. It was the Russians' first goal of the tournament. They scored their second 15 minutes later when Dmitry Bulykin was left totally unmarked to power home a bullet of a diving header from a Rolan Gusev corner. With Greece looking shocked, and their nerves ragged, they were lucky not to have gone further behind when Andrei Karayka volleyed a great chance over from close range midway through the first half. The goal that proved their eventual salvation came just before half time, when Zisis Vryzas pulled one back. Dimitrios Papadopoulous headed the ball down into his path, and he muscled past his marker to chip the ball over Malafeyev. The second half was a more composed affair than the end-to-end first, but Russia looked the more likely to produce a goal, and nearly did so when substitute Dmitry Sychev almost made it 3-1 after 61 minutes. Nikopolidis did superbly well to beat away his shot. Greece will now meet the winners of Group B, likely to be France, on Thursday. On this form, they will need a miracle to progress."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
