The full-back Stuart Moffat, wing Nikki Walker and prop Bruce Douglas all contributed to the team's success on their international debuts and look likely to be involved against South Africa on Saturday. Yet, while the trio relish the challenge, they are under no illusions as to the task. \"I know it will be very, very different against South Africa,\" said Moffat, who scored the last of Scotland's five tries. \"They will be determined to beat us to make amends for their defeat by France. \"The Boks will attack from all quarters and I expect to be fully tested. We are going to have to raise our game at least another two hurdles before we will be on the same ball park.\" With the experienced Mattie Stewart ruled out with a rib injury, Scotland's coach Ian McGeechan looks certain to retain Douglas. \"Your first cap is always a momentous occasion but facing the Boks would be a different ball game entirely,\" Douglas said. \"The Romanians were very physical and powerful up front but I imagine the Springboks will be several steps up.\" Scotland: Moffat; Walker, Craig (Hinshelwood, 74), Laney, Paterson; Ross (Townsend, 72), Redpath (capt); Smith (Stewart, 63), Bulloch, Douglas, Murray (Hines, 63), Grimes, Leslie (Scott, 80), Pountney, Taylor (Petrie, 72).
