We lived in the same village and I knew Sir Bert well because he was West Brom's chairman during my first spell there. He took me into the big time and for that I'll always be grateful. I was in charge of Cambridge in the old Third Division when Sir Bert offered me the West Brom job and gave me that chance to push through. I found him a very easy chairman to work with. He never wanted to interfere on the football side and backed me with whatever budget there was. I had the utmost respect for him. Then again, I think everybody did, and there are not many people you can say that about. Even those who criticised Sir Bert for his chairmanship of the Football Association seemed still to respect him. My first encounter with Sir Bert came before I joined West Brom and it showed the sort of man he was. He was in charge of the FA's disciplinary committee and I appeared in front of him with Brendon Batson, my captain at Cambridge, who'd been sent off. Sir Bert gave us a very fair hearing. Brendon had been shown a red card for hitting an opponent but Sir Bert took into account that the player had been taunting Brendon with monkey taunts. He didn't suspend Brendon because he felt the sending-off had been punishment enough. Sir Bert struck me then as a reasonable man and I always found him to be that. Mind you, he wasn't shy when it came to criticising referees. I sometimes sat next to him at the Hawthorns during the first half and within 20 seconds his first target was inevitably the referee. On several occasions I thought: \"Blimey, I'm moving away. This is the chairman of the FA's disciplinary committee and he's having a pop at the referee all the while.\" He was a very committed West Brom fan and stayed heavily involved even after he stepped down as chairman. To be given the opportunity by him to go there in the top division is something I'll never forget. I'd been making a name for myself at Cambridge, bringing them from the bottom of the old Fourth Division to the brink of the Second, but it needed Sir Bert to take a chance on me. I went to see him and West Brom's vice-chairman Tommy Silk and, within about 20 minutes of that meeting, Sir Bert more or less informed me I had the job and he just had to speak to the board. It wasn't a long meeting, just a cup of tea at a hotel near Rugby. We did get further afield, with Sir Bert taking West Brom on a tour of China which made us the first western team to go there. He was leader of the delegation and attended enough functions to last anyone a lifetime. His standards never slipped, although there was one occasion when we must have embarrassed him. One night Sir Bert came back into our hotel with the Chinese delegation to find a couple of the players running naked through the foyer. One of the lads had a bucket of water and was chasing a team-mate to throw it over him. The boys had been at a party and thought there was no one about. It could have caused an international incident if the funny side hadn't been seen. I think Sir Bert might have dismissed it as an English custom when we're happy. He was always the diplomat. I remember attending a board meeting at West Brom where I realised Sir Bert was destined to become a leading figure in the game. He agreed with seven different points of view on the same subject. I sat there astounded but he had that way with people. Even before he got his knighthood he was known as Sir Bert. That's not to say he wasn't opinionated or couldn't hold his own in an argument. I never saw him outraged but there was a bit of friction when I left West Brom for Manchester United. He tried to stop me going but there was never a problem when I saw him after that. In fact, while he was in charge of the FA he got Jimmy Armfield to sound me out about the England job. I was at Aston Villa and genuinely wasn't interested because I preferred club management. But by and large I felt Sir Bert gave the England managers a fair deal. He was at the FA during a difficult time which included Heysel and Hillsborough but I thought he dealt with those issues very well. He was also a magnificent figurehead for West Brom, a very correct club. Sir Bert will be missed there and, as a leading figure in the community, he'll certainly be missed in the village."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
