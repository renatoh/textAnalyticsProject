For a more recent generation Rory Underwood's vapour trails still hang in the air. On Saturday it was the turn of Jonah Lomu, Ben Cohen, Doug Howlett and James Simpson-Daniel to rise to tradition and play their part in a match that will live long in the memory of a capacity crowd. Afterwards each of them had a story to tell. Howlett, hailed by his coach as \"up there with the best in All Black history\", made his mark with a stupendous 40-metre dash to the line, Jason Robinson floundering in his wake. With equal speed Cohen scored with a run from the halfway line and saved the game for England with a brilliantly judged try-saving tackle two minutes from time. And Simpson-Daniel, the 20-year-old debutant, could point to an early block on Lomu and a wonderful right-angled run which opened the way for Jonny Wilkinson to score a quick-witted try. All of this appeared to mock the announcement of the death of the specialist winger recently made by Steve Hanson, the Wales coach, who intends to field a team containing three interchangeable full-backs. Classical wing play was alive and flourishing at Twickenham on Saturday, even if its exponents had been required to absorb lessons in tactical flexibility. Inevitably it was Lomu, the least flexible of the four, who provided the focus of attention. Since he mowed down Will Carling's team in Cape Town in 1995 he has held a special fascination for the English. To the All Blacks, however, he has not been the same player since he was struck down by a serious kidney disease shortly after that World Cup and there were theories that yesterday's appearance would represent not so much the next act in his career as a curtain call. Although he ended up on the losing side for the first time in his seven meetings with England, Lomu scored the first and third of New Zealand's four tries and gave the present generation a taste of the runaway steamroller treatment handed out to their predecessors. His opposite number, Simpson-Daniel, was also the only one of the four wings not to cross the line. And yet, still only 27, Lomu is seen in New Zealand as part of the past, not the future. While he struggled to regain his health, rugby moved on. It is no longer enough for him to lurk at the end of the line, waiting for the ball. As Cohen said on Saturday night, modern coaching aids such as the ProZone cameras mean that even a winger's contribution to the whole 80 minutes is under constant scrutiny. On Saturday night, breaking the silence he has maintained since arriving in England, Lomu revealed the conditions on which John Mitchell, head coach, had invited him into the squad. \"He went straight to the point. 'You've got three weeks and that's it. Get yourself right.' I could have gone either way. I could have buried myself out there on the pitch today or I could stand up and help to show the younger fellows what All Black rugby is about.\" Lomu lost eight kilos in two weeks and tried to get his mind straight. \"I've been working really hard to get myself into this shape,\" he said, \"and I completely shut myself off so I just focus on what I've got to do. I've been in this team for so many years and I don't want to let anyone down.\" Mitchell was tolerably pleased with the initial outcome of his gamble. \"Jonah worked a little bit more off the ball today,\" Mitchell said, \"but we're still looking for more. He's a unique player and, if we can get him back to his best, it will be good for New Zealand rugby.\" Lomu's own verdict was equally realistic. \"When you get opportunities like that,\" he said, \"you've got to take them. I'm trying to do my job right, trying to take the right options and trying to get myself into the game as much as possible. I'm still looking for that perfect game, the complete game.\" Although England's coaches and players denied suffering from a Lomu complex, they left no doubt of the impression he continues to make on them. \"Jonah is a big-match player,\" Clive Woodward said, \"and he's always looked good against England. He did outstandingly well today. We lost him a couple of times and we got him a couple of times.\" When asked if he now expected to be in Saturday's team against France, Lomu remained modest. \"No, I don't,\" he said. \"That's one thing I don't take for granted. I try and earn it. I'm just lucky to get on this tour. I was given the opportunity and I'm starting to repay the coaches for their faith.\" But, whatever Lomu's future and whatever the true significance of these autumn internationals, Saturday's was a game to be enjoyed for its own sake, and for demonstrating that creative coaching need not always stifle the most exhilarating of rugby's ancient arts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
