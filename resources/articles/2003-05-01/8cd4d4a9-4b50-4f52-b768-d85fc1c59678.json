I did not sit in the audience at University College, Worcester, and therefore did not hear his musing on medieval history and culture. But I have no problem in accepting his subsequent claim that he did not attack the discipline of medieval history in his speech. An examination of his subsequently published transcript indicates that this speech had little to do with the discipline of history as such. The aim of Clarke's intervention was to promote his belief that the justification for a state-funded university was its ability to deliver subjects that are useful for the labour market and for stimulating economic growth. With the present political regime you know where you stand. Back in January, Margaret Hodge, the higher education minister, warned universities against trying to meet government targets by putting students on \"Mickey Mouse\" courses. When pressed on the definition of a \"Mickey Mouse\" course, Hodge stated that she was worried about degrees that \"may not have huge relevance to the labour market\". The belief that the mission of university is to provide students with degrees that employers want is also vigorously advocated by Clarke. As he noted, education for its own sake is \"a bit dodgy\" and students need a relationship \"with the workplace\". The Worcester speech simply elaborated Clarke's technocratic vision of university life. It is surprising that the initial reports of Clarke's remarks have raised such a furore. It is worth recalling that since the early 80s successive governments have sought to turn higher education into a servicing agency for the labour market. Throughout this period politicians and their officials have systematically directed the academic profession towards more work-related and vocational forms of course provision. This process was not confined to displays of subtle pressure but was accompanied by an unprecedented intervention into the domain of curriculum design and development. Years of relentless pressure have ensured that universities have internalised the instrumentalist ethos that regards higher education as a period of preparation for employment. The new technocratic jargon associated with the ascendancy of \"key skills\" and \"competencies\" is now used to justify course outlines. Subject-related benchmarking statements and departmental mission statements promise to provide students with the skills that will make them highly employable. Everyone plays the game and swears on the bible of relevance. In British academic life this is the only way you can justify your existence. Last week supporters of medieval history defended their position by arguing that history graduates were \"extremely employable\". Martha Lane Fox, the head of Lastminute.com and a graduate in ancient and medieval history at Oxford University, was hailed as living testimony to the value of medieval studies. Unfortunately it is not possible to win the argument against philistinism by competing in the relevance stakes. Such an approach fails to challenge the vocational orientation of current policy on higher education. And by accepting the premise that the worth of a course is affirmed through its relevance, the battle for a more academic focus for higher education will be lost. Clarke and his predecessors seek to associate the idea of education for its own sake with some elitist medieval institution. In reality no institution has ever pursued activities for their own sake, in the medieval past or today. The aim of this caricature is to deprecate the idea that the pursuit of knowledge and truth has some intrinsic value in and of itself. Somehow the aspiration for knowledge has been turned into a medieval prejudice. Taylorist higher education focused on skills and relevance may sound pragmatic and down to earth. In reality its value to society is open to question. It offers formulaic, off-the-shelf, easily quantifiable bits of knowledge whose contribution to a modern flexible society remains unproven. Prosperity, creativity and enterprise depend on an environment of creative thought in which people have an opportunity to develop their ideas in relation to a variety of subjects and problems. So what should be the purpose of a forward-looking 21st century university? We need universities to provide expert teaching and cutting edge research and to provide an environment for the unrestrained pursuit of knowledge. Not the kind of knowledge that flatters authorities. Not knowledge that is deemed to be a stimulant to economic growth but knowledge driven by a complex mix of passions that cannot be given a technocratic label. One final point. Medieval institutions were bitterly hostile to the unrestrained pursuit of knowledge and those in authority were no less happy to intrude in the affairs of scholars than their colleagues today. Today, the spirit of medievalism may well be thriving in the most unexpected of places. \u00b7 Frank Furedi is professor of sociology at the University of Kent at Canterbury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
