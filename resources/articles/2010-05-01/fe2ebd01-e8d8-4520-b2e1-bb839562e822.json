In some areas hundreds of people lost their chance to vote because they were stuck in queues, while elsewhere polling stations ran out of ballot papers when turnout was higher than anticipated. Lawyers are planning to challenge the procedures in the high court by claiming that voters were denied a basic human right to take part in the general election. The electoral commission will publish its inquiry into what went wrong after interviewing officers at all affected polling stations and receiving evidence from hundreds of voters. Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, whose Sheffield Hallam constituency saw some of the worst problems, said the report would help spell out what went wrong in the \"fiasco\". He said: \"We must make sure this never happens again. You must be confident that come polling day you will be heard.\" The human rights group Liberty has conducted its own call for evidence and received more than 220 submissions from people who lost their vote. Half of those relate to lost postal votes. The Guardian reported on hundreds of cases of lost postal votes in the runup to the election and leading electoral officers warned that the government's timetable of 11 days in which to issue postal ballots, send them out and get them back was impossible \u2013 especially for people overseas who relied on them. Liberty's legal director, James Welch, said that it had ruled out petitioning for a rerun of the results because the number of people excluded in each area was not high enough to have affected the result of the ballot, the legal test for an official petition. But Welch said Liberty would mount a challenge on human rights grounds, which would take the form of a high court application for judicial review. \"The reason for doing it would be establish the principle that these things shouldn't have happened \u2013 to have it recognised that organisation was so chaotic that people lost their votes. We would also ask the courts to rule on the issue of whether there can be some flexibility if people are in queues,\" he said. Such a ruling could establish new case law that would allow returning officers to continue to admit people after 10pm if the alternative was those people losing their vote. \"There were particular problems in Sheffield Hallam where they segregated students and non-students and prioritised non-students. Liverpool Wavertree ran out of ballot papers altogether,\" he said. Human rights lawyer Richard Stein, of Leigh Day and Co solicitors, is offering to represent anyone affected by the problems. He told the Islington Tribune, which covers another area where there were polling station problems: \"We're exploring it to see if there's a basis for a challenge to the approach the returning officer took. They should have given ballot papers to everybody there and available to vote at 10pm. It's an important principle.\" Much of the controversy has focused on the different decisions taken in different polling stations when the size of the queues became apparent at the end of the night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
