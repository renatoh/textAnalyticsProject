But those people are wrong: this is a good song. From its Very Serious Piano Chords to its This Hurts A Lot Pizzicato Strings and its You Know I Mean Business Choral Backdrop, this song is designed to get you right in the heartstrings. And it does! Banoffee ft Empress Of Tennis Fan There is nothing more suss than dating someone who doesn\u2019t want you to meet their friends and, having been there, I\u2019m quickly becoming obsessed with this wild \u201chate the player and the game\u201d bop. If there is one thing more annoying than dating an idiot, it is getting peanut butter stuck to the roof of your mouth \u2013 and, whaddya know, Banoffee ft Empress Of have us covered there, too: \u201cAnd now that it\u2019s in, no, I can\u2019t get it out.\u201d La Do\u00f1a Le Lo Lai A small part of me suspects this is actually quite a rubbish song but there is something irresistible about this ode to, basically, swiping through Tinder on holiday. Refreshingly, it\u2019s the dude who gets obsessed and wants to get hitched while La Do\u00f1a is like, er, I\u2019m outta here. With its Spanish lyrics and hula-hook, Le Lo Lai has a strong summer feel; you can\u2019t help wishing it had come out about four months earlier. Sorry Right Around the Clock Anyone of a certain age spent at least a month thinking that Gary Jules\u2019s slow, sad cover of Mad World was the pinnacle of emotion, so it\u2019s a savvy move for Sorry to interpolate their own take on Tears for Fears\u2019s classic. Over an all-over-the-place sax line, they drunkenly dream of fame, although it sounds a lot like a case of being careful what you wish for. Coldplay Orphans It sounds like Chris Martin and the Other Ones hired Apple, Moses, Canesten Duo and the rest of their offspring for the group vocals on this new song railing against the Syrian civil war and dreaming of getting drunk with your mates as a form of escapism. You have to admire Coldplay for at least trying to branch out: this, and its sludgy, proggy co-release Arabesque, are worlds away from things being all yel-low. But it doesn\u2019t really matter what they do, or who they employ for a singsong, they always sound like, well, Coldplay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
