Eriksson is expected to stick with the diamond midfield formation that led the fight-back in Bratislava on Saturday, meaning Paul Scholes will play in the hole rather than on the left. Only one change in personnel from the side that started the second half in Slovakia had been anticipated, Sol Campbell returning at the expense of Jonathan Woodgate, but Eriksson may be faced with another alteration after Emile Heskey missed full training yesterday afternoon at a St Mary's Stadium lashed by wind and rain. Heskey, one of four players including Kieron Dyer who participated in light jogging and stretching only on Monday, is carrying a slight groin strain. If Heskey cannot play, Alan Smith will step up for his first competitive start. Smith impressed in last month's friendly with Portugal at Villa Park, scoring with a powerful header, and both he and Eriksson would be comfortable about him replacing Heskey. Smith got about seven seconds when he came on for Heskey in Bratislava last Saturday but at least he got on. Darius Vassell did not. Whoever partners Michael Owen, the pair will again rely on Scholes bridging the gap between midfield and attack. In the first half in Bratislava England were stretched out; \"lonely\" was how Owen described his and Heskey's isolation. But with Scholes conducting, England were much better company. Scholes's name dominated Eriksson's thoughts yesterday and the Manchester United player has the opportunity to become the key creative personality tonight. Eriksson said that Scholes, together with Steven Gerrard and David Beckham, could walk into any club or international team in the world. The fourth midfielder from Slovakian action, Nicky Butt, was omitted from Eriksson's short- list. \"If he could choose his position forever, he would choose central midfield,\" Eriksson said of Scholes and his relative reluctance to play on the left. \"But Paul is a very bright football player and he sees more than himself. Every time I talk to him I am surprised. He is a thinker; he could be a manager. Maybe he doesn't talk very much but he thinks football and he knows what's best for the team. Maybe tomorrow he will be more central. \"I always thought the best position for Scholes is central midfield. The team has a lot of benefit from him because when he has the ball and turns he makes things happen, playing one-twos, he gives good short passes, he can shoot. He's important for us in that position.\" Scholes in the hole leaves another hole - on the left. But that is nothing new for Eriksson. Eleven different characters have tried to fill that berth in Eriksson's 22 England matches - from Nick Barmby to Scholes - and it appears now that, at least temporarily, Eriksson has abandoned hope of finding an automatic answer. \"I think I have a complete team but I can't find a natural left-winger like Ryan Giggs who is English,\" Eriksson said. \"It's a pity. Every time Kieron Dyer is called to the national team, he seems to get injured. He is very, very unlucky. \"He practised very, very well before the Slovakia game, the best I have seen. He could do the left job. Heskey has done it well. Barmby is one of around 30 names I have in my head. But Dyer could have been a very good alternative there.\" Against a Macedonia side that Eriksson and his scouts felt were a little unlucky to lose to Turkey England may have to be patient. Macedonia will play with 10 men behind the ball and could frustrate in the way Albania did before being overcome at St James' Park last year. It is more than five months to England's next qualifier, in Liechtenstein, and Eriksson is planning a training camp next month and a friendly in February, possibly against Denmark, so it is vital for qualification and morale that England leave the public humming a good tune after tonight. Scholes can lead the band."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
