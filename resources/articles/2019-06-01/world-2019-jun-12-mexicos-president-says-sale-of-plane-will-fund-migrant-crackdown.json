Funds from the sale would be put toward the deployment of the newly formed national guard which has the power to detain migrants without correct papers, L\u00f3pez Obrador said on Wednesday. Under the deal struck on Friday, Mexico agreed to enforce the new measures to stop migrants crossing its territory in order to head off Donald Trump\u2019s threat of imposing import tariffs of 5% on Mexican goods. Mexico promised to send 6,000 members of the militarized national guard to seal its porous southern border with Guatemala \u2013 a major route for migrants fleeing violence, poverty and climate change. L\u00f3pez Obrador, also known as Amlo, insisted that the agreement had averted an economic and financial crisis and was \u201ca good deal for our country\u201d. \u201cAbout how much this plan is going to cost, let me say, we have the budget,\u201d Amlo said at a daily news conference. \u201cIt would come out of what we\u2019re going to receive from the sale of the luxurious presidential plane.\u201d Amlo said the starting price for the plane would be $150m. He expected the sale to close this week. On Tuesday, the foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said the immigration deal would be revisited in 45 days and a regional deal with countries in Central and South America would be sought if the migrant flows failed to slow. But critics pointed out that the new national guard was initially presented as a force to fight organized crime and rein in Mexico\u2019s soaring murder rate. \u201cNow they\u2019re using this national guard not only to pacify the country, but for the detention of migrants,\u201d said Alberto Xicot\u00e9ncatl, director of the migrant shelter in the city of Saltillo. \u201cIt strikes us as a hypocritical discourse.\u201d Making good on his promise to rule with frugality and restraint, L\u00f3pez Obrador regularly travels on commercial flights rather than the presidential plane, for which he said Mexico had paid up to 8bn pesos ($392m). On Tuesday, El Universal newspaper reported that during the first three years of the preceding administration, 746 bottles of alcohol were consumed on the aircraft \u2013 including 35 bottles of booze which were opened on a short flight from Mexico City to Acapulco. In contrast to his predecessor Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, L\u00f3pez Obrador has shown little interest in foreign travel, arguing there are too many problems at home. He has not left the country since taking office and has said he will skip the upcoming G20 conference in Japan. \u201cMexicans associate presidential travel with waste,\u201d said Rodolfo Soriano-N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a sociologist in Mexico City."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
