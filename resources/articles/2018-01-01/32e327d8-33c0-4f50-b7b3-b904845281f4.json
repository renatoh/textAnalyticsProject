Our latest Carillion story, about the strain on suppliers, is on tomorrow\u2019s front page: Hello again. Wednesday\u2019s front pages are coming through, and many are leading on the Carillion crisis. The Daily Telegraph\u2019s business section focuses on the meagre scraps that will be available to Carillion\u2019s creditors: City AM says Carillion\u2019s directors face mounting pressure as the \u2018fast-track\u2019 probe into their activities looms: The FT leads on those court papers, showing how Carillion had run so short of cash: The Morning Star predicts that Carillion\u2019s rivals will also be dragged into trouble: The dramatic collapse of Carillion has started to hit thousands of the firm\u2019s suppliers, as the real world impact of the demise starts to emerge, the Guardian reports tonight. Subcontractors owed money by the construction and services giant are already being pressurised by their banks and have begun laying off workers, as the threat of contagion afflicting the sector was likened to a near re-run of the banking crisis. Andrew Adonis, the former Labour transport minister, said: \u201cIt is a bit like Lehman Brothers [the Wall Street investment bank that collapsed in 2008]. You don\u2019t know what the impact will be. A very large part of Carillion\u2019s work was project management where subcontractors do the work, but these subcontractors don\u2019t know if they will be paid.\u201d The supplier concerns came as the liquidators PricewaterhouseCoopers said they would not pay any bills \u201cfor goods/services provided before the liquidation date [on Monday]\u201d, while Carillion workers providing services to private sector firms face having their wages stopped on Wednesday unless another employer steps in to take over. Here\u2019s our full story: The UK government is under growing pressure tonight over its handling of the collapse of Carillion, one of the UK\u2019s biggest contractors. Prime minister Theresa May has insisted that taxpayers should not have bailed out Carillion, which plunged into liquidation yesterday. She told a cabinet meeting that the government would be \u201cvigilant in monitoring for any emerging issues in public services\u201d at schools, hospitals, prisons and beyond. Labour, though, have accused ministers of \u2018colluding\u2019 to keep Carillion in business, even as it posted a string of profit warnings. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told parliament: \u201cWhen there were loud and clear worrying signs about Carillion, why, instead of intervening, did the Treasury Minister collude in the strategy of drip-feeding more contracts to Carillion to buoy up an obviously failing company?\u201d \u201cI put it no stronger than this: at this stage, there are real suspicions that the Government was too close to this company and too wedded to its privatisation role. The government is promising to provide support for thousands of British staff working for private-sector companies inside the stricken conglomerate. But their wages are only guaranteed until Wednesday under the current contingency plans. Unions have warned that the clock is ticking. They urged ministers to protect the 8,500 workers on private sector contracts, who fear losing their jobs and being unable to pay their mortgages. The TUC has called for a new National Task Force. It would protect jobs, pensions and services, and look for other serious problems in the outsourcing industry. Carillion\u2019s directors are also under the microscope. The government has ordered a \u2018fast-track\u2019 investigation into their conduct, and a full investigation of the work done by the company\u2019s auditors, KPMG. Papers filed at the high court show that Carillion\u2019s many creditors may get as little as 1p in the pound. That would be a very serious blow to small firms who were owed money for work they\u2019d carried out. Some have already begun firing staff. Although Carillion wasn\u2019t a household name, the collapse of such a major player in the outsourcing and construction industry has rattled the sector. Could other firms be next? My colleague Nick Fletcher has been kicking the tyres of rivals such as Serco, G4S, Capita and Balfour Beatty to test their resilience. Here\u2019s his verdict on Capita: About half of Capita\u2019s annual turnover of \u00a34.9bn comes from central and local government work, ranging from administering the teachers\u2019 pension scheme to providing tech services to the NHS, electronic monitoring services and running the Gas Safe register for the Health and Safety Executive. It has 70,000 UK employees, and a net debt of \u00a31.6bn compared with its market value of \u00a32.8bn. The company\u2019s shares have lost two-thirds of their value over the past two years after a series of profit warnings and boardroom changes. Here\u2019s Nick\u2019s full verdict: Accountancy firm PwC is under scrutiny tonight over its involvement in Carillion\u2019s collapse. PwC staff were appointed as \u2018special managers\u2019 yesterday, to help the Official Receiver run the company. But the firm doesn\u2019t come to the crisis with a blank slate - last year, it was advising Carillion\u2019s pension trustees, according to the Financial Times. These \u2018multiple roles\u2019 don\u2019t look great, the FT says tonight: The head of a rival accounting firm, who requested anonymity, added that PwC\u2019s appointment \u201csimply looks wrong\u201d. \u201cFrom a professional point of view they might just be the right side of the line [in terms of managing conflicts], but optically they will be on a hiding for nothing. Even if they are OK, they are not OK,\u201d he said. PwC, which is expected by other executives to earn as much as \u00a350m from the liquidation process, declined to comment. On the other hand.... the government could hardly appoint KPMG or Deloitte, as they have both acted as Carillion\u2019s auditors, while EY had also advised Carillion. That only leaves smaller firms, who might have less expertise or experience of such as massive job. The problem - as with the outsourcing sector - is that there are too few rivals, and thus less genuine choice. Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin agrees that lessons need to be learned from the Carillion crisis. Jenkin chairs the Public Accounts Committee, which announced an inquiry into the outsourcing of public services yesterday. Speaking on Channel 4 News, Jenkin says the government should \u201cexpand the pool of companies\u201d which it awards contracts too. The governments \u201cpreferred bidder system\u201d makes the assumption, perhaps wrongly, that bigger companies are safer than smaller ones - Jenkin adds. Unions have warned the government that the \u201cclock is ticking\u201d for thousands of Carillion workers. The GMB says there are at least 8,473 Carillion private sector workers in the UK, whose jobs are vulnerable following the firm\u2019s liquidation on Monday. GMB general secretary Tim Roache says the government must not \u201cthrow workers the wolves\u201d. Roache, who met business secretary Greg Clark this evening, says: \u201cThe clock is ticking for Carillion\u2019s 8,500 private sector workers, and the Government must now offer them reassurance and financial guarantees. \u201cNo worker should go hungry, default on a bill or miss a rent or mortgage payment because of a crisis they did not cause.\u201d The unions are worried because cabinet office minister David Lidington said yesterday that the government would only protect Carillion\u2019s private sector contracts for 48 hours. That raised fears that jobs cut start being cut on Wednesday.... Carillion\u2019s collapse means the company\u2019s workers and pensioners will soon be in the hands of the UK\u2019s pension\u2019s lifeboat. The Pension Protection Fund is widely expected to take on Carillion\u2019s pensions deficit, of around \u00a3580m. Those already taking pensions will be protected, but those members below retirement age will face cuts of 10-20%. The PPF has got the resources to cope. But my colleague Rupert Jones reports that its pockets are only so deep.... The former pensions minister Steve Webb told the Guardian that \u201cCarillion would be the biggest-ever hit on the PPF\u201d but that the lifeboat would be able to \u201ccomfortably absorb\u201d the Carillion scheme. Nigel Green, the chief executive of deVere Group, one of Britain\u2019s biggest independent financial adviser firms, said: \u201cUK final salary pension schemes have an enormous deficit black hole, which raises the inevitable question: how many more big hits can the PPF take?\u201d The Carillion liquidation, he said, \u201cshould trigger alarm bells for pension savers across the UK\u201d. Labour MP Rachel Reeves is also piling pressure on the government tonight. She\u2019s calling on ministers to urgently tighten Britain\u2019s corporate governance rules to prevent another Carillion crisis. Reeves, who chairs the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee, says firms shouldn\u2019t be allowed to pay out dividends when they\u2019re also reporting profit warnings or losing money. She told the BBC News that: In the end, the people who lose out when money is siphoned off is suppliers, workers, and when government contract are involved it\u2019s ultimately the British tax payer. It\u2019s not acceptable that those risks can be transferred to the taxpayers and employees, while the executives get the bonuses and the dividends. That\u2019s not right and the corporate governance code urgently needs to be tightened up in the light of this scandal. Here are the key quotes from shadow chancellor John McDonnell in parliament earlier today, as he called for \u201cfull transparency\u201d into the Carillion crisis. \u201cWhen there were loud and clear worrying signs about Carillion, why, instead of intervening, did the Treasury Minister collude in the strategy of drip-feeding more contracts to Carillion to buoy up an obviously failing company?\u201d \u201cI put it no stronger than this: at this stage, there are real suspicions that the Government was too close to this company and too wedded to its privatisation role. \u201cWe need full transparency on meetings and discussions that took place between Government ministers, civil servants and representatives of Carillion and what warnings were given to ministers and what actions recommended implemented or not. We now need the Treasury to start playing its proper role and provide an independent assessment of the potential costs and risks facing the taxpayer.\u201d In response Liz Truss, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, reiterated Theresa May\u2019s view that taxpayers shouldn\u2019t bail Carillion out. \u201cIt would be completely wrong for a company that had got itself in this state to be bailed out by the state and that is what we are not doing. Truss also accused McDonnell of taking \u2018cheap shots\u2019. \u201cI think that the Government is dealing with this in a responsible and measured way, rather than making cheap political shots at a time when people\u2019s jobs are in question and we are working to sort that out.\u201d The Federation of Small Businesses is alarmed to hear that Carillion\u2019s creditors might only recover 1% of the money they are owed (as flagged up earlier). The Evening Standard\u2019s Russell Lynch has the details: The revelation comes in a High Court witness statement submitted by the interim chief executive, Keith Cochrane, on the company\u2019s liquidation yesterday and seen by the Standard. Cochrane\u2019s account of the six-month prelude to the company\u2019s demise also delivers a broadside against the firm\u2019s lenders and reveals that private sector clients were refusing to give them new work in contrast with the Government, which awarded them major contracts on the HS2 rail scheme last summer. Carillion collapsed under the weight of \u00a31.6 billion in debts and a pension deficit of \u00a3587 million this week, leaving many suppliers facing ruin. But Cochrane\u2019s statement also refers to an \u201centity priority analysis\u201d by accountants EY, which had been working with the firm since the summer, on the impact of a potential failure of the bank last month. \u201cThis showed that the insolvency recovery for creditors in the event of a group-wide liquidation would be an average of between 0.8p in the pound and 6.6p in the pound,\u201d he wrote. The Federation of Small Businesses said: \u201cIf these figures are correct, many small businesses will not be able to cope with that kind of impact on their cashflow.\u201d Here\u2019s a video clip of John McDonnell telling MPs today that the government was \u201ctoo close\u201d to Carillion, and chose to \u201cdrip-feed\u201d contracts to the company rather than heed the warning signs. Shares in UK geotechnical engineering contractor Van Elle have tumbled by almost 8% today, after it told shareholders that it is owed \u00a31.6m by Carillion. The Carillion crisis has spurred many Guardian readers to write in with your views (as well as many excellent online comments, of course!). For example, Paul Davies of Goring, Oxfordshire, says ministers must be held to account: The government has been trumpeting its code that requires large companies to treat their suppliers fairly and pay them on the same terms as the government pays the big companies. Instead it has emerged that Carillion used its suppliers as a bank \u2013 refusing to pay them except on 120-day terms, while being paid on 30-day terms by the government. For the officials and ministers in so many departments to have turned a blind eye to this bullying by Carillion is a disgrace and it is surely time that both officials and ministers in transport, defence, health, education and elsewhere are held accountable for this total failure. If ministers weren\u2019t aware of this, the officials should be subject to disciplinary procedures. The brevity award goes to Rick Barker of Stocksfield, Northumberland: \u201cMore is not always better. Million, billion, trillion\u2026 Carillion.\u201d Tomorrow\u2019s newspaper includes a selection of the best, which are online here: Reuters has calculated that Carillion paid out $1bn (\u00a3775m) to its shareholders in dividends since the firm was created 19 years ago. The company has been criticised for its \u2018progressive dividend\u2019 policy -- basically boosting returns to investors each year. Had it paid out less, it could have done more to tackle its pension deficit (\u00a3580m), and could have trimmed its net debts, which swelled to \u00a3900bn by the time of its collapse. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor John McDonnell has blamed \u201cshambolic Tory government and mismanagement by Carillion\u2019s fat-cat bosses for the company\u2019s collapse. Writing in the Guardian tonight, McDonnell says: Nothing has come to symbolise the worship of free market solutions \u2013 often against all the evidence \u2013 more than the persistent belief that key public services would be better provided by profit-seeking companies. As the journalist Robert Peston put it, the collapse of Carillion represents the definitive end of a 25-year love affair with the private provision of public services. The end of the affair has revealed some unedifying details about some of the participants in it: the apparent reliance by Carillion\u2019s management on \u201clow-balling\u201d bids to win them, then sweating suppliers and workers to squeeze a profit; Chris Grayling\u2019s insistence on awarding Carillion the HS2 contract even after its first profit warning; David Cameron\u2019s decision to appoint Carillion\u2019s chairman, Philip Green, as an adviser on corporate responsibility. McDonnell also points out that Labour has promised not to sign any new PFI contracts if it wins the next election, adding: If the Tories won\u2019t wake up to the reality of the changing economic landscape, it\u2019s time they stood aside and let us take over. Andrew Bounds, the Financial Times North of England correspondent, reports that there was little action at a Carillion site in Salford, Manchester, today: Here\u2019s a picture of Andy Bradley of Flora-Tec, who was forced to lay off 10 staff because he\u2019s owed \u00a3800,000 by Carillion (see this morning\u2019s posts) I think he\u2019s holding some mulch. Manure might be more appropriate, given the situation facing hundreds of Carillion\u2019s own suppliers. The agency Scottish Enterprise is setting up a hotline to help any Scottish companies affected by the collapse of Carillion, particularly on the \u00a31.5bn project to build the Aberdeen bypass. Keith Brown, the Scottish economy secretary, outlined the measures to MSPs this afternoon. Answering an emergency question at Holyrood, Brown said the 36-mile long Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) should continue without significant disruption as the two other firms in the consortium, Galliford Try and Balfour Beattie, were contractually obliged to keep the working going. The hotline number is 0300 013 3385. Businesses can also register their details at https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/help/contact-us However, details about the impact on the AWPR\u2019s delivery date, on contractors and employees, or on other Scottish businesses affected by Carillion\u2019s collapse, remain sketchy. Galliford Try and Balfour Beattie estimate it will cost them an extra \u00a360-\u00a380m to over Carillion\u2019s withdrawal from the AWPR project. Carillion also has facilities management contracts with Scottish public sector bodies, and is working for Network Rail and the Ministry of Defence in Scotland. The Scottish Builders Federation and Federation of Small Businesses have urged their members to come forward if problems emerge. Brown told Jackie Baillie, of Scottish Labour, some contracts may need to be taken over the public sector. The firms building the AWPR, a PFI-style scheme with a construction price of about \u00a3550m at 2012 prices but a total contract cost of \u00a31.47bn, have already admitted it is far more costly than expected. Galliford Try said in September it had lost \u00a389m on two fixed-price Scottish projects: the AWPR and the new Queensferry bridge over the Firth of Forth, and would no longer bid for fixed price public contracts. Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green party co-leader, urged Audit Scotland, the public spending watchdog, to include Carillion\u2019s collapse into its investigation into Scottish government PFI projects. The Audit Scotland inquiry was launched after the Guardian disclosed ministers had lost \u00a3450m in public borrowing on the AWPR because it breached strict European rules on how PFI projects are included in government accounts. The shockwaves from Carillion\u2019s liquidation has reached Canada, where the company employs 6,000 people. Canadian unions say the crisis shows that handing key public services to private companies is a mistake. They are pushing Ontario\u2019s provincial government to stop the privatisation of hospital service contracts. Reuters has the details: The call for the Canadian government to step in came from Unifor and the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions (OCHU/CUPE), which represents employees at the William Osler Health System, The Royal Ottawa Hospital, Halton Healthcare and the Sault Area Hospital. The hospitals have service contracts with Carillion, the unions said, adding the workers are among the 6,000 Canadian workers affected by the Carillion liquidation. \u201cIt is also time for these projects to be brought back into the public sector. The folly of private ownership of the hospitals is exposed fully by this bankruptcy,\u201d OCHU president Michael Hurley said in a statement. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has welcomed the government\u2019s decision to fast-track the investigation of Carillion\u2019s current and former directors. But, like John McDonnell earlier, he also wants ministers to answer questions about their actions. \u201cWe also need a National Audit Office probe, followed by parliamentary scrutiny by the Public Accounts Committee to fully understand what led to Carillion\u2019s collapse. \u201cWe need to know why the Government felt it was not wrong to feed Carillion lucrative public sector contracts when they knew the company was in severe trouble because of its profit warnings.\u201d ITV\u2019s Joel Hills has more details of the Carillion witness statement, and it\u2019s very bad news for creditors: Those creditors will include big banks, and also small firms who were contracted by Carillion such as Flora-tec which is already sacking staff. Nationwide Building Society has agreed to pay around 250 Carillion employees who work its data centres and head office until the end of this month. However, the future of up to 1,500 workers who clean its national branch network hangs in the balance, as the government is only protecting private-sector contract workers until Wednesday. Tim Poil, general secretary of the Nationwide Group Staff Union, which directly represents 250 Carillion employees, said: \u201cWe have been negotiating with Nationwide since the end of last week. Nationwide has said to the Carillion employees on the Nationwide contract - about 250 in total - that they will ensure they will be paid to the end of the month.\u201d The 250 staff are understood to be maintenance engineers in the data centres, who were transferred from Nationwide to Carillion in 2008, plus reception and security staff at the society\u2019s Swindon headquarters. Carillion is also responsible for the cleaning of Nationwide\u2019s 650 branches around the country - but had itself outsourced the work to other companies. The number of cleaners could be as high as 1,200 to 1,500, said Poil. \u201cMy understanding is that Nationwide has been in touch with the company to ensure the branches do get cleaned,\u201d said Poil, but their future contractual arrangements remain very unclear. A major problem for private sector employers that outsourced to Carillion, said Poil, is that the company is officially neither in adminstration or insolvency. If Pricewaterhouse Coopers sells the service contracts to another outsourcing company, then the unions expect employees to be transferred (or Tupe\u2019d) over to the new employer with existing terms and conditions. But if Carillion is declared insolvent, then employers will have to decide whether to take employees back in house or hurriedly obtain a new outsourcing company to do the work. Poil says: \u201cMy question to Nationwide is, should you really be outsourcing these sorts of services? It might have looked good at first, but it has fallen apart. If they say to us again they want to outsource some work currently done in house, we\u2019ll be saying, Carillion? Are you sure?\u201d An official spokesperson for Nationwide said the society hopes to issue a formal statement later today. The FT reports that Carillion had reached a perilous financial position by the time it fell into liquidation on Monday morning. Their reporter, Gill Plimmer, explains writes: Carillion was left with just \u00a329m in cash when it collapsed, according to a document that reveals the extent of the construction company\u2019s financial black hole. Papers seen by the Financial Times show the insolvent construction company owed \u00a31.29bn to its banks, including a \u00a3790m revolving credit facility and \u00a3349m in private placement notes. The papers also show that two firms were unwilling to become administrators, as they feared they might not get paid..... Newsflash: America\u2019s stock market has hit a new alltime high, as the bull market continues. The Dow Jones index jumped by 0.86%, or 223 points, to 26,027. This is the first time it has ever burst over the 26k mark. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaw are also at new peaks. Now, the Dow isn\u2019t a great measure of the US economy (or even the wider stock market, really). And this is just an arbitrary number. But, the speed at which shares are rising is remarkable - it\u2019s less than two weeks since the Dow burst through 25,000. Sky News is reporting that Carillion\u2019s interim chief executive, Keith Cochrane, has accused Royal Bank of Scotland of undermining efforts to keep it afloat. Cochrane apparently criticised banks, including RBS, in a witness statement filed at the High Court Sky\u2019s Mark Kleinman reports: According to Mr Cochrane\u2019s witness statement, RBS informed Carillion last Thursday that it wanted the company to pre-fund supplier payments made through the bank, which meant it would need to make those payments two days earlier than cashflow forecasts had assumed. He said this negatively impacted Carillion\u2019s liquidity by between \u00a32m and \u00a320m. RBS, he added, insisted that this revised arrangement \u201cwould be in place until support from [the Government] had been agreed and that the terms of this support would determine whether other uncommitted facilities with RBS would be withdrawn\u201d. Having been bailed out in 2008, RBS is still majority-owned by the taxpayer -- who of course is now on the hook for potential costs at Carillion. The UK division of Spanish bank Santanter has also been blamed, for making changes to Carillion\u2019s \u2018Early Payment Facility\u2019 - used to make payments to suppliers. Cochrane says: \u201cThe company relied upon that EPF in order to assist it making payments to its suppliers. \u201cSantander informed the group\u2019s suppliers that arrangements to automatically prepay invoices submitted by the supplier would be terminated and it sent a separate email to certain of its suppliers that \u2018all payments with Carillion are stopped\u2019. Theresa May told her cabinet that the \u201ctaxpayer could not be expected to bail out a private company\u201d following the collapse of Carillion, according to her official spokesman. He said the prime minister addressed the issue at the start of this morning\u2019s meeting of her top team of ministers, arguing that a lot of work had gone into trying to find suitable financing options but that had not proved possible. The spokesman made clear that in the short term the government would ensure that public services carried out operating, but that was simply replicating money that would have gone to the company - rather than pushing up the bill for taxpayers. They admitted that public money would have to go to paying the receiver. However, a Whitehall source denied the suggestion that the money could run into the hundreds of millions, saying \u201cit will be nowhere near that\u201d. The official spokesman said May thanked David Lidington and other departments for making contingency arrangements. \u201cThe PM said that public services had continued to be provided but there would be no complacency,\u201d he added. \u201cShe said Government would be vigilant in monitoring for any emerging issues in public services and in providing support for employees of companies with private sector Carillion contracts.\u201d Business secretary, Greg Clark, also briefed the cabinet about his call for a fast-track investigation into the conduct of Carillion\u2019s directors. The spokesman said: \u201cThis means the Official Receiver\u2019s investigation will consider whether those who are, or were previously directors of the company may have caused detriment to those owed money, including workers and businesses affected.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has accused the UK government of colluding to support Carillion by \u2018drip-feeding\u2019 it with contracts. Speaking on Sky News, McDonnell said ministers erred by keeping handing Carillion contracts in recent months, after July\u2019s profit warning. McDonnell is urging openness and transparency: We need a full public inquiry, immediately, to find out exactly what happened. We want to know what the government\u2019s involvement in all this is. McDonnell says the government needs to reveal how much the taxpayer could lose, now that the Official Receiver has taken control of Carillion. This could be a bottomless pit if we\u2019re not careful. Greg Clark\u2019s call for a \u2018fast-track\u2019 investigation comes \u201cso late\u201d in the day, McDonnell continues, suggesting that the government has serious questions to answer: Government ministers seem to have colluded in a strategy where, even when they know the company was in trouble, when the company\u2019s share price was collapsing and there were profit warnings and resignation [they] still drip-fed this company with public contracts. It was just a strategy that was bound to fail, and put pressure on workers and unfortunately now taxpayer as well. City AM\u2019s Cat Neilan has tweeted Greg Clark\u2019s letters, which ratchet up the pressure on Carillion\u2019s management, and its auditors at KPMG. Newsflash: The UK\u2019s Department for Business is pushing for a \u201cfast-track\u201d investigation into Carillion\u2019s directors. Business secretary Greg Clark has written to the Insolvency Service and the Official Receiver, asking for the statutory investigation into the conduct of Carillion\u2019s directors to be fast-tracked and extended in scope The probe will examine whether any Carillion directors, past or present, committed any misconduct or harmed creditors, workers and other businesses. Clark has also asked the Financial Reporting Council to examine how Carillion\u2019s accounts were prepared, and the actions of its auditors -- KPMG. Clark says: It is important we quickly get the full picture of the events which caused Carillion to enter liquidation, which is why I have asked the Insolvency Service to fast-track and broaden the scope of the Official Receiver\u2019s investigation. In particular, I have asked that the investigation looks not only at the conduct of the directors at the point of its insolvency, but also of any individuals who were previously directors. Any evidence of misconduct will be taken very seriously. Clark is also due to meet with the heads of the TUC and Unite union, Frances O\u2019Grady and Len McCluskey, later today. Yesterday, Carillion\u2019s management were heavily criticised for changing their bonus rules, making it harder to claw back payments. The Institute of Directors called the move \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d Nicky Morgan MP asks Philip Hammond how the government will help small firms who are struggling to pay wages and their tax liabilities. Hammond says HMRC already has a scheme to help firms who have problems pay their tax bills. Ministers have agreed that HMRC should \u2018signpost it\u2019 on the government\u2019s Carillion information websites. Shadow chancellor John McDonell warns the government that thousands of Carillion employees will turn up to work tomorrow, not knowing if they have a job. Workers in the supply chain also face an uncertain future, McDonell adds. He asks how many PFI contracts were signed off by the Treasury under Philip Hammond, and what will happen to the people who work on them. And why did ministers \u201ccollude in the strategy of drip-feeding more contracts\u201d to \u201cbuoy up an obviously failing company\u201d? Chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, says the government\u2019s priority is to keep supplying public services and support Carillion\u2019s workers. But it would be wrong to prop up a private company that got itself into difficulties. Over in parliament, chancellor Philip Hammond has been quizzed about the Carillion crisis. Labour MP Helen Goodman asks about what protection is being provided to the Official Receiver, which took control of Carillion\u2019s operations after it fell into liquidation yesterday. Hammond confirms that the government has given the Receiver an indemnity, to protect it from any losses. It also has a credit line to cover costs, which can be recovered from government departments in teh future. Q: What exposure does the government have to Carillion, though loans to the company or support for exports? Hammond says he isn\u2019t aware of any direct exposure to Carillion, but will check. The TUC says its proposed Carillion taskforce would have five priorities: involve unions to give Carillion workers certainty on their jobs, pay and pensions; bring Carillion\u2019s public-sector contracts back in-house to ensure consistent delivery; support transfer of private sector contracts to alternative providers with jobs, pay and pensions protected; fund a training and financial support package for at-risk workers and apprentices; and perform a risk assessment on other large outsourcing firms to avoid another crisis. BREAKING: Britain\u2019s trade unions are calling for a \u2018national taskforce\u2019 to be set up, to protect UK firms from the collapse of Carillion. The TUC, which represents many UK trades unions, says the government needs to take urgent action to protect workers at Carillion, and across the wider economy. It also wants ministers to conduct \u2018risk assessments\u2019 of other large outsourcing firms, to see if they are facing similar problems Yesterday the West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, the former boss of John Lewis, said he had set up a taskforce to assist Carillion suppliers and subcontractors. The TUC are pushing for a much larger initiative, though. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: \u201cWe urgently need a national taskforce involving unions to safeguard jobs, services, and pensions. \u201cWorkers can\u2019t be left at the back of the queue. Each and every worker at Carillion needs to know where they stand. They have bills and mortgages to pay, and deserve certainty on their future. \u201cAnd we have to ensure that there aren\u2019t more Carillions on the horizon. That means an immediate risk assessment of all large outsourcing firms with government contracts. Public services are already under pressure, and can\u2019t take another hit like this.\u201d The Treasury have created a little video to show how they\u2019re helping Britons cope with inflation: No mention of the public sector pay cap, though, or the surge in import costs cause by the weak pound.... Getting back to Carillion....and the Bank of England has reassured MPs that Britain\u2019s financial system won\u2019t be shaken by the firm\u2019s collapse. Sam Woods, deputy governor for prudential regulation, told the Treasury committee that he has checked banks and insurance groups\u2019 exposure to Carillion on Friday - as it tried (in vain) to reach a rescue deal with its creditors. Woods said: \u201cThe direct exposures are entirely manageable across all institutions.\u201d It\u2019s harder to tell what the full impact will be, though, as smaller firms (such as Flora-tec and Van Elle) count the cost. Woods says \u201cWill there be a wider indirect issue with all the suppliers?... That is a more difficult one. I am not massively worried about it.\u201d Aberdeen Standard Investments chief economist Lucy O\u2019Carroll warns that inflation will only fall slowly this year: \u201cToday\u2019s headline number doesn\u2019t amount to a hill of beans in isolation. But it\u2019s more interesting in the context of what\u2019s been happening with inflation lately. It appears to be steadying around 3%, and could stay close to this level for the next few months. Looking a little further into 2018, inflation is likely to drift down gradually as the rise in prices caused by the pound\u2019s decline falls out of the numbers. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, is also hopeful that UK inflation has passed its peak: \u201cLast month saw CPI inflation fall slightly to 3%. Much of the recent rise in inflation was driven by sterling\u2019s devaluation during 2016. \u201cHowever, this factor will begin to fade and inflation should fall back towards the 2% target over the coming year, with Producer Prices figures already showing input price inflation falling sharply.\u201d But Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, remains cautious: \u201cWe can finally breathe a small sigh of relief as inflation has slightly fallen. We\u2019re by no means back to the luxury of low inflation but the fact it hasn\u2019t risen again gives us a slight helping hand. \u201cWe aren\u2019t out of the woods yet though, for many of us prices are still rising faster than wages, so purse strings will still be tight. The cost of everyday items like food and household goods as well as transport continue to push up the cost of living, so budgeting is key. BBC economics correspondent Andrew Verity has dug into the inflation data, and spotted some big cost increases: But BlackRock\u2019s Rupert Harrison (a former top Treasury official) hopes that the worst is over: Fund manager BlackRock, incidentally, is one of the firms who short-sold Carillion\u2019s shares -- the resulting profits mean it isn\u2019t too worried about a cost of living squeeze..... The pound has dropped by 0.2% following the inflation figures, as City traders calculate that it makes an early interest rate rise less likely. This has pushed the FTSE 100 index up to 7791 points, a whisker away from a new all-time high. This drop in inflation shows that the impact of the pound\u2019s sharp tumble after the Brexit vote is now fading. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, explains: \u201cConsumers will breathe a sigh of relief that escalating living costs are showing signs of abating. The Brexit vote brought with it the side effect of depreciating sterling, and the subsequent rise in import costs, pushing inflation well beyond the Bank of England\u2019s target. These effects are dissipating somewhat, and core inflation remains lower still. But she also warns that real wage growth \u201cremains elusive\u201d, so household budgets will remain tight until earnings accelerate. Britain\u2019s financial \u2018pinch\u2019 seems to be easing, says Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics: \u201cThe good news is that inflation appears to have peaked. We expect inflation to fall fairly sharply, to around 2.5% by Spring, which will ease the pressure on household budgets. \u201cThat said, food inflation remains near four-year high and petrol prices rose sharply as the continued impact of Brexit and rising commodity prices fed through supply chains. This is from James Tucker of the Office for National Statistics: The UK government will be relieved to see Britain\u2019s inflation rate fall, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: \u201cAmidst the negative headlines around the collapse of Carillion, there is some more positive news for Prime Minister Theresa May this morning, as December\u2019s inflation figure has eased slightly from its six-year high in November. \u201cWith inflation dropping, and sterling back to its highest level since the Brexit referendum, there is a growing feeling of optimism around the British economy at the moment, with many predicting inflation will fall closer to the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target in 2018. \u201cHowever, with wage growth lagging well behind, it will be a long time before this positive news translates into people having more money in their pockets.\u201d Good news for households -- Danske Bank analysts suggest Britain\u2019s inflation rate may have now peaked. Bad new for workers -- WorldFirst economist Jeremy Cook fears wages won\u2019t overtake inflation for some time Economist Rupert Seggins flags up that \u2018core inflation\u2019, which strips out volatile factors like food and energy, has dropped. But financial journalist Simon Read points out that high street saving accounts aren\u2019t keep pace with the cost of living. Despite December\u2019s dip in inflation, the cost of food, household goods and transport services pushed the cost of living up. The Office for National Statistics says the downward effect on inflation came mainly from air fares, along with a fall in the prices of a range of recreational goods, particularly games and toys. But... The downward contributions were partially offset by an increase in tobacco prices, reflecting duty increases that came into effect following the Autumn Budget, along with an increase in petrol and diesel price. This chart shows how inflation (in yellow) has finally started falling for the first time in six months. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s inflation rate has fallen for the first time since last June. The Consumer Prices index rose by 3.0% in December, down from 3.1% in November (a six-year high) That means that Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze has eased a little (although prices are still rising faster than wages, which grew by 2.3% in the last year). More to follow.... Economics professor Mariana Mazzucato says Carillion\u2019s collapse should trigger a fundamental rethink about how public services are supplied, and paid for: Julia Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, says small companies who supplied Carillion face little prospect of being paid. Palmer told Wake Up To Money: There\u2019s an order of priority. Secured creditiors will be paid first, ahead of unsecured creditors, of whom there will be be a very large number. Many sub-contractors will be reeling, wondering how on earth they recover from this. Top UK government ministers are expected to discuss Carillion\u2019s collapse later today, when Theresa May\u2019s cabinet meet at Downing Street. Last night, ministers held a meeting on the crisis. Afterwards, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington claimed efforts to deal with the crisis had \u201cgone pretty well\u201d. Lidington added: \u201cThe message today was that day one had gone pretty well, people were turning up to work, we had not had reports of any serious disruption to service delivery.\u201d UK\u2019s horticultural services company Flora-tec has been badly hit by the collapse of Carillion, giving a chilling example of the \u2018domino effect\u2019 that could hit the UK economy. The firm faces a loss of \u00a3800,000 on work carried out for Carillion -- and took the dramatic step of laying off 10 people yesterday after the liquidation. Andy Bradley, managing director of Flora-tec, told the BBC\u2019s Wake Up To Money programme that his firm provided \u2018ground maintenance\u2019 at schools and hospitals. His staff were up at 3am during last month\u2019s cold snap -- clearing snow and putting salt down. But he doesn\u2019t expect to be paid for that work; a serious blow, as \u00a3800,00 is over 10% of annual turnover. Bradley warns that he now faces \u201ca massive black hole in our accounts\u201d with no guarantee that he will ever be repaid. He was damning about the government\u2019s role in the crisis. They encouraged small firms such as Flora-tec to get involved in public sector contracts, Bradley explains. And they also kept handing Carillion contracts after last summer\u2019s profits warning; if Westminster trusted Carillion, why wouldn\u2019t a small SME? Yesterday\u2019s liquidation was a \u2018sucker punch\u2019 says Bradley, adding: I had to make 10 people redundant yesterday. that\u2019s 10 people with mortgages and car loans It\u2019s an absolute disgrace... I\u2019ve got people to pay. I\u2019ve not got the money to pay them. Infrastructure investment company John Laing has told the City that it can handle Carillion\u2019s collapse. John Laing has nine \u2018operational PPP (public partnership) projects where Carillion are the Facilities Management provider, 4 schools projects, 4 emergency services projects and 1 road project. But Carillion\u2019s demise isn\u2019t a shock - John Laing has drawn up contingency plans, and is now seeking to replace Carillion with another facilities management (FM) firm without disruption John Laing says: The Investment Adviser\u2019s asset management team have been aware of the issues affecting Carillion and have had contingency plans in place for some time. These have involved discussions with a number of potential replacement providers and the Investment Adviser is in the process of implementing these contingency plans and seeking to appoint alternative FM providers on all of the 9 projects to replace Carillion. At this stage the Investment Adviser expects that this can be achieved with minimal service disruption and minimal additional cost. BUT... that may also mean job losses at Carillion, if companies such as John Laing take their business elsewhere.... Several construction and engineering firms have updated the City this morning about the Carillion crisis. Van Elle, a geotechnical engineering* contractor, told shareholders that it is currently owed \u00a31.6m by Carillion for various contracts in December, and work taking place in January. Van Elle says it faces an \u2018adverse financial impact\u2019 if it can\u2019t get this money back It also had orders from Carillion worth \u00a32.5m of revenue, for this year and beyond [for comparison, the company\u2019s revenues were \u00a394m last year] CEO Jon Fenton says Carillion\u2019s collapse is \u2018disappointing\u2019. Shares in Van Elle have plunged by almost 10% in early trading * - complicated foundations, ground work, that kind of thing. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze may finally be easing, after a tough year for UK households. New inflation figures, due this morning, are expected to show that price pressures eased a little last month. The Consumer Prices Index is tipped to have fallen to 3.0% in December, down from near six-year high of 3.1% struck in November. If so, that would suggest that the slump in the pound after the EU referendum has finally worked its way through the system. And with sterling back at a post-Brexit hit - close to the giddy heights of $1.38 -- inflation might keep dipping in 2018. However, few citizens will be firing off any leftover party poppers. Wages are only growing at around 2.3% per year, which means people are still getting a pay cut in real terms. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets suspects that inflation could be \u2018stickier\u2019 than some economists expect. He says: Last month the Bank of England governor found himself having to pen a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining the reasons as to why the Bank of England had exceeded its headline inflation target by more than 1%, after CPI came in at 3.1% for November, the highest level since March 2012. Later this morning we\u2019ll find out if the December numbers have fallen back from those heady peaks. While most expectations are for that indeed to be the case, with a drop back to 3%, one can\u2019t help feeling that this optimism might well be misplaced. Airfares were a key component that underpinned the CPI number in November and it is quite likely that could happen again, furthermore fuel prices also rose in December. The one bright spot could well be food and drink with shop price inflation expected to be on the soft side. Core CPI is expected to slip back a touch to 2.6% from 2.7% It seems more probable that inflation is likely to remain stickier than usual for the next couple of months as the January effect of higher rail fares also bleeds through into the numbers. It should then start to soften towards the end of Q1 assuming the pound stays at its current levels. We\u2019ll also be keeping an eye on the Carillion crisis. The demise of the UK construction and services group is turning into a major political row; as we covered last night, Labour are calling it a \u2018watershed moment\u2019, and demanding an end to \u2018rip-off\u2019 privatisations. Thousands of Carillion workers are now nervously wondering about their future, as the government is only protecting staff on private sector work until Wednesday. Scores of small firms up and down the country also face disruption and the threat of unpaid bills, and may soon be taking tough decisions. But life goes in on the City; retailer JD Sports, cakes and sauces maker Premier Foods, bakers chain Greggs, and estate agent Savills are all reporting results. The agenda: 9.30am GMT: UK CPI and RPI inflation figures for December 9.30am GMT: UK house price index for November 1.30pm GMT: US Empire manufacturing data (tracking factory output in and around New York) We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
