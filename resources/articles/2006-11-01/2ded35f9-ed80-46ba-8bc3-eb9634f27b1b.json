Birmingham appeared to be heading for a sixth successive league win until Jody Craddock struck in the 89th minute. It was an equaliser shrouded in controversy with referee Mark Halsey waving play on in the lead-up to the goal after Sebastian Larsson took a blow to the head. The Birmingham midfielder collapsed to the ground after he collided with Gary Breen, whose arm appeared to be raised. Halsey, though, refused to whistle for a free-kick and Wolves chose not to adhere to the unwritten rule that says that the ball should be kicked out when an opposition player is injured. When Wolves won a corner from the attack that followed, Bruce was already bristling with indignation and his misery was compounded after Craddock headed the ball home at the far post for the equaliser. Larsson should have been occupying the position on the corner of the six-yard box from where Jay Bothroyd flicked the ball on, but instead the young Swede was still clambering back to his feet. Bruce made it clear that he did not believe Breen's offence was intentional - in contrast to his interpretation of the West Bromwich full-back Paul Robinson's elbow on Damien Johnson three weeks ago - but the Birmingham boss was deeply upset with Halsey's failure to stop play. \"It's a foul on Larsson,\" insisted Bruce. \"I'm not saying it was a deliberate elbow or anything like that. But Larsson has gone down with a head injury and, usually, either the opposition team [kicks it out] or the referee pulls it up. It's the repercussions of that. Larsson is down and, of course, his area is the near post where the corner comes in. But, to be fair, it should be a consolation goal. We had enough chances to win two or three games of football.\" That much was true. Birmingham needed to score seven goals to go top of the table following Cardiff's home defeat on Friday night and that tally would not have been beyond their reach had they converted all the opportunities created. Cameron Jerome, Nicklas Bendtner and Gary McSheffrey, who had given Birmingham the lead on the half-hour with a thumping left-foot volley from the edge of the area, all squandered opportunities to stretch the home side's advantage. It was not only profligacy that cost Birmingham, though. Matt Murray, the Wolves goalkeeper, was outstanding, coming to the rescue of a central defence that was frequently exposed. One double save, six minutes after the interval, was particularly memorable as he showed both agility and bravery to repel Bendtner's cross-shot before gathering at the feet of Jerome. The 25-year-old had earlier turned McSheffrey's shot around the post and smothered Jerome's attempt to steer the ball past him. Wolves' bid to find any fluency of their own was stymied by a 4-5-1 formation that left Jay Bothroyd isolated. Indeed, it was not until on the stroke of half-time that the Birmingham goal was seriously threatened, Karl Henry's 30-yard drive arrowing towards the far corner until Bendtner deflected it wide. The visitors, who had lost their previous five away matches without scoring, showed more belief after the interval and Daniel Jones's curling free-kick brought a fine save from goalkeeper Maik Taylor. It still looked as though Birmingham would hold on to record a sixth successive clean sheet in the league for the first time since 1921 but Craddock had other ideas. Mick McCarthy, the Wolves manager, said: 'I understand Steve is unhappy. It pisses him off that we nicked a point with two minutes to go. 'However, I didn't see any blood coming out of Larsson's head or a broken nose. There might be an element that he was trying to stop the game to take the sting out of it.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
