Lukaku started and scored in Anderlecht's league match against KV Mechelen last night but an agreement is still to be reached over the size of the fee that would take him to Stamford Bridge. The Belgian club are understood to be seeking a substantial down-payment of around \u00a313m, with add-ons to follow, for the 18-year-old forward, with Chelsea seeking a smaller initial sum and more money associated to appearances and future honours. \"There is no agreement at the moment,\" said Van Holsbeeck, who was in London yesterday along with Lukaku's agent, Christophe Henrotay, to meet Chelsea officials before returning to Brussels where he unveiled Anderlecht's signing from Liverpool, Milan Jovanovic. \"The dream of our club chairman [Roger Vanden Stock] is to keep Lukaku to play with our new player, Milan Jovanovic, in the team. But we have to be realistic. \"There are on-going negotiations and Chelsea know what we want. Imagine that, one day, Roman Abramovich is in a good mood and he offers that amount and this can be fixed tomorrow. At the moment that is not the case. However, all three parties know what they want and what we have to do to come to an agreement. And now most of it depends upon Chelsea.\" Lukaku's desire to play for Chelsea has long been clear, with the player having indicated yesterday that he was hopeful a deal was nearing completion. \"I am waiting very calmly for the phone call that will tell me everything has been agreed between the clubs,\" he said. \"Anderlecht and my agent are aware that this uncertainty is not good for the club or for me. They will fix things at some time in the future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
