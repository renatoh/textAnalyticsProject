A comfortable majority, 54% (against 46%), backed the amendment that will allow President Ch\u00e1vez to run for office again in 2012. This suggests the population broadly wants to continue the overall path begun by Ch\u00e1vez 10 years ago. By contrast, a constitutional referendum in 2007, which included this issue, was lost because it was proposed along with more than 60 other measures \u2013 many of which were not understood, let alone supported, by the majority. In last year's regional and local elections, the Ch\u00e1vistas won control of the great majority of state and local governments. However, they lost ground in the capital, Caracas, and in some of the most urban and economically important parts of the country. This reflected significant dissatisfaction with the pace of improvement in the cities blighted by vast shanty towns and the acute problems of waste disposal, transport and crime. These issues have so far been addressed far less effectively than the breathtaking improvements in healthcare, education and the reduction of poverty. The number of people living in extreme poverty has halved in the last 10 years. Infant mortality has fallen by more than a third. The number of GPs providing free public healthcare has increased exponentially and number of students entering higher education has doubled. The cities need massive investment and reform to carry these improvements through into other areas that determine people's quality of life and the overall efficiency of the economy. In these circumstances, it is easy to see why Venezuelans should vote to continue along the path mapped out by Ch\u00e1vez, by allowing him to stand for re-election while punishing incompetent local politicians and giving the government a wake-up call on other issues not getting the attention they require. As always, there are some who cannot accept the legitimacy of Sunday's referendum, simply because it did not produce the result they desired. They are oblivious to the meticulousness of Venezuela's democratic process, and even the fact that most media are in private hands. They argue that the removal of term limits is inherently undemocratic. But that is a difficult case to make, as there was no term limit for the US president until 1951 and there are none today for the US Senate, the House of Representatives or Britain's House of Commons. The test of democracy is not term limits for public representatives, it is that the people must be free to elect their own representatives and also to democratically decide the form of democratic government they consider appropriate. In Venezuela on Sunday, they did just that. The choice was logical. For 10 years, under Ch\u00e1vez's presidency, the country has seen greater democracy and social progress than at any time in its history. The population want Ch\u00e1vez to stay in power to address the most intractable problems, especially in cities, left by previous regimes with the same vigour that his government has already shown in fields like health and education."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
