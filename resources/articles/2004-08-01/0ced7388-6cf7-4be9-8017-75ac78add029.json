He wants to swap the post-Marxist theory of political economy for weapons so that he can start a revolution. The alien intelligence, loosely modelled on a sentient Edinburgh Festival, complete with Fringe and deadly critics, wants proof that the theory works. Comrade Rubenstein is arguing that to prove the theory will take a revolution and he can't start one without the weapons. Faced with phones falling from the sky, randomly granted wishes and mounting social unrest, the government of the New Republic decides to travel back in time and stop the revolution before it happens. Which is all very well, but God, or what passes for God in this universe, disapproves of messing with causality. Reading Singularity Sky is like being trapped in the middle of an exploding ideas factory without a helmet. It's sometimes too dense for its own good, but Stross's debut is still likely to be one of the most significant works of SF this decade. Time's Eye, by Arthur C Clarke and Stephen Baxter (Gollancz, \u00a312.99) It is 1885 and Rudyard Kipling is busy on the northwest frontier, earning a living as a journalist when a UN helicopter crash-lands nearby, causing understandable consternation. The helicopter's inhabitants think it's 2037, 20 years after the war between India and Pakistan went nuclear and Lahore was wiped off the map. Then there are the apes - captured by soldiers of the Raj, they are actually pithecine ancestors of the human race and think, in as much as they think at all, that the world has become very odd indeed. Something, somewhere is messing with time - or maybe space. And since the metal spheres that have begun to appear wherever time gets messy have circumferences based on 3 rather than pi, there's a good chance that something is alien. Most SF authors do big ideas, but Arthur C Clarke and Stephen Baxter seem determined to go one better. Time's Eye mixes high concepts with rip-roaring Boys' Own adventure and gives bit parts to everyone from Genghis Khan to Alexander the Great. Code Noir, by Marianne de Pierres (Orbit, \u00a36.99) Just another day in a city where magic and high technology meet. Parrish Plessis, currently warlord, wanted criminal and possessed by an alien parasite, has a stark choice: repay a debt to the deeply scary Cabal Coomera by killing the renegade Loyl Dac, or incur their displeasure. Unfortunately, Loyl Dac happens to be the only person in this dank and dirty world whom Parrish Plessis actually likes. And, of course, before she kills Loyl Dac (if she decides to do so), the Cabal would like her to discover who has kidnapped their shaman... In Code Noir, Marianne de Pierres continues to play fast and loose with post-cyberpunk sensibilities while fleshing out the slums and characters she set up in Nylon Angel. What makes this more than just another Mad Max clone set in a post-apocalyptic Australia is De Pierres' use of emotional cruelty and unhappy endings to keep the narrative - and readers - off balance. Clever, but like Parrish Plessis, she plays a dangerous game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
