Capello's present contract runs up until Euro 2012 and the FA chairman David Bernstein has said it will not extend the Italian's deal. \"If your manager's not good enough, that's your country's fault,\" Carragher told TalkSport. \"Get a better manager. Do the coaching qualification better. I think it's a form of cheating at international football and to be honest it's a little bit embarrassing. \"I think Capello's come into the job with all he'd done at Milan, and what he'd done at Real Madrid, and he's got an aura about him, a presence. \"Steve McClaren didn't have any of that coming into the job. And even if it didn't go right with him, you can't say, 'Oh, it's all right, we'll get a foreign manager now.' It's unfortunate but you have to go with the next best thing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
