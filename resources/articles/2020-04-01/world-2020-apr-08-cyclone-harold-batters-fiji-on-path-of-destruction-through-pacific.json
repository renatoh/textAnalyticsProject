The tropical cyclone was downgraded to category four before reaching Fijian waters. Fijian authorities ordered people to stay indoors and closed all roads on the island of Viti Levu, which is home to the country\u2019s capital of Suva and the bulk of the Pacific nation\u2019s population. Frank Bainimarama, the country\u2019s prime minister warned earlier on Wednesday that \u201cthe worst of TC Harold will strike Fiji through this afternoon \u2026 Flying debris and floodwaters can be deadly. All Fijians should stay indoors unless directed to evacuate.\u201d Images emerged of flooded streets on the west coast of Viti Levu, and buildings demolished. Harold was expected to hit Tonga in the next 48 hours. The Matangi Tonga website reported that Harold\u2019s arrival in the country would coincide with a king tide and a supermoon early on Thursday morning. An extreme high tide warning was in force for Tonga for Thursday and Friday. Fijian authorities have had days to prepare for the storm, which formed near the Solomon Islands before cutting a destructive path through Vanuatu. The storm has already wreaked a path of destruction through the Pacific. Twenty-seven people are missing and feared dead after being swept off a ferry in rough seas caused by the cyclone in Solomon Islands. The storm hit Vanuatu on Monday and two days later, it is still unclear how badly the country was hit. Communication lines to Vanuatu\u2019s hardest hit islands - Espiritu Santo, Malo and Pentecost among others - were severed by the storm and it\u2019s expected that calmer weather today to bring devastating news of the cyclone\u2019s full devastation. There have been no reports of loss of life, but some pictures of destroyed buildings and flooding have already emerged. Rebuilding efforts will be complicated by the spread of Covid-19, with relief agencies desperately worried how to maintain social distancing measures while carrying out their work. There are currently no confirmed cases of the disease in Vanuatu but the government has placed a ban on inbound flights to help containment efforts. New Zealand\u2019s High Commission in Vanuatu is working on options to get stranded citizens back to New Zealand. A Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said damage to the northern and central part of Vanuatu was \u201cserious\u201d and New Zealand \u201cstands ready to support the Government of Vanuatu\u2019s response\u201d.
