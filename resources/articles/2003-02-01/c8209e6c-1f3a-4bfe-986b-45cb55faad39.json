Lord Joel Joffe, a retired human rights lawyer who defended Nelson Mandela, introduced the patient assisted dying bill in the House of Lords. The private members' bill, which stands little chance of becoming law, would allow a terminally ill adult to request medical assistance to die. Under the proposed legislation, a competent adult suffering from a terminal or serious incurable physical illness would need two doctors - including a consultant - to confirm their diagnosis. The medics would also have to ensure that all alternatives, including palliative and hospice care, had been considered, Patients would then have to make a written declaration that they wanted to die, witnessed by a solicitor who was satisfied the patients understood the implications of the decision. Lord Joffe said: \"The Diane Pretty and Reginald Crew cases highlighted the pressing need to allow terminally ill competent adults greater choice in the manner of their death. \"This issue has been debated at length in the media and every poll in the last decade shows over 80% public support in favour of changing the law. \"The debate must now be brought into parliament. \"For public policy reasons the patient assisted dying bill contains strict safeguards to ensure the vulnerable in society are protected.\" There is an opt-out clause for doctors who feel they cannot help a patient for reasons of conscience. As an additional safeguard there would be a \"waiting period\" after the request to die so the patient can give yet more thought to their decision. A monitoring commission would also keep records on every case of assisted dying. The bill is due to receive its first reading today and has the backing of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society. Lord Joffe defended Mr Mandela in the 1963-4 Rivonia trial."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
