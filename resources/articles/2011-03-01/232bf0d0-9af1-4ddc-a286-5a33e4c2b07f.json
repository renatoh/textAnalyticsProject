But Gaddafi's preoccupation with the jihadi group is genuine and reflects years of repression and counter-terrorist co-operation, which has enhanced his value to the US and other western governments. In recent days Libyan officials have distributed security documents giving the details of Sufiyan al-Koumi, said to be a driver for Osama bin Laden, and of another militant allegedly involved in an \"Islamic emirate\" in Derna, in now-liberated eastern Libya. Koumi, the documents show, was freed in September 2010 as part of a \"reform and repent\" initiative organised by Saif al-Islam, Gaddafi's son. Under the programme, hundreds of convicted members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), an al-Qaida affiliate, have been freed and pardoned. \"This is more than propaganda,\" Noman Benotman, a former LIFG commander, told the Guardian. \"It's a direct threat from Gaddafi. He's warning the west: 'Help me or you will see al-Qaida getting a safe haven in Libya.' But his claims are just not credible.\" The LIFG, established in Afghanistan in the 1990s, has assassinated dozens of Libyan soldiers and policemen. In 2009, to mark Gaddafi's 40 years in power, it apologised for trying to kill him and agreed to lay down its arms. MI6 has been accused in the past of supporting it. Six LIFG leaders, still in prison, disavowed their old ways and explained why fighting Gaddafi no longer constituted \"legitimate\" jihad. Abdul-Hakim al-Hasadi, another freed LIFG member, denied the official claims. \"Gaddafi is trying to divide the people,\" he told al-Jazeera. \"He claims that there is an Islamist emirate in Derna and that I am its emir. He is taking advantage of the fact that I am a former political prisoner.\" Derna is famous as the home of a large number of suicide bombers in Iraq. It is also deeply hostile to Gaddafi. \"Residents of eastern Libya in general, and Derna in particular, view the Gaddadfa (Gaddafi's tribe) as uneducated, uncouth interlopers from an inconsequential part of the country who have 'stolen' the right to rule in Libya,\" US diplomats were told in 2008, in a cable since released by WikiLeaks. The last 110 members of the LIFG were freed on 16 February, the day after the Libyan uprising began. One of those released, Abdulwahab Mohammed Kayed, is the brother of Abu Yahya Al Libi, one of al Qaida's top propagandists. Koumi fled Libya and is said to have ended up in Afghanistan working for Bin Laden. Captured in Pakistan, he was handed over to the US and sent to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in 2002. In 2009 he was sent back to Libya. US counter-terrorist experts have expressed concern that al-Qaida could take advantage of a political vacuum if Gaddafi is overthrown. But most analysts say that, although the Islamists' ideology has strong resonance in eastern Libya, there is no sign that the protests are going to be hijacked by them. Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, Bin Laden's regional \"franchise,\" has condemned Gaddafi and urged Muslim scholars, thinkers and journalists to support the Libyan uprising. The group said: \"We were pained by the carnage and the cowardly massacres carried out by the killer of innocents Gaddafi against our people and our unarmed Muslim brothers who only came to lift his oppression, his disbelief, his tyranny and his might. \"We only came out to defend you against these despots who usurped your rights, plundered your wealth, and prevented you from having the minimum requirements of a dignified life and of freedom and human dignity.\" The group, under pressure from Algerian forces in the north, has moved some of its operations to the desert area straddling Niger, Mali, Algeria and Mauritania where the vast expanses and porous borders have provided it with a safe haven."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
