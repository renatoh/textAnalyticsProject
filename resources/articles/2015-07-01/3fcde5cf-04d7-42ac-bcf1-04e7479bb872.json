In a referendum seen as the single biggest experiment in people power since the debt-stricken country crashed on the rocks of bankruptcy, 61% of voters rejected the terms of further financial assistance set by creditors at the European Union and International Monetary Fund. Lobbed at the heart of Europe with the force of a rocket launcher, the rejection was a cry of rage. \u201cOxi, oxi, oxi [No, no, no] that was what we had to say,\u201d said Roula Apostolou, a student, who had rushed to the headquarters of prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s radical leftwing Syriza party. \u201cWhat you have heard is the voice of the people, the rage of the gods.\u201d As it became increasingly apparent that the no vote had prevailed, thousands took to the streets, packing into Syntagma Square, the plaza in front of the Greek parliament, under a sea of flags to celebrate the result. It is a huge personal triumph for Tsipras, who had defied creditors with last week\u2019s bombshell decision to hold the plebiscite. Since calling the vote, the firebrand had urged Greeks to say a \u201cbig no\u201d to measures that would, he argued, simply worsen the country\u2019s spiralling economy. In an atmosphere poisoned by divisiveness and recrimination \u2013 with past prime ministers imploring voters to stand by Europe with a \u201cbig yes\u201d \u2013 many believed Greeks might reject the leader\u2019s plea. Opinion polls had shown both camps running neck and neck, with pro-European modernisers gaining ground in recent days. The endorsement of the no campaign by the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party had further muddied the waters. But as voters poured into polling stations throughout the day, a picture of defiance emerged. Few believed that a no vote necessarily meant being forced to exit the euro or the EU. \u201cThat was a false dilemma created by the internal and external propaganda machine,\u201d countered Irini Apostolopoulou, a civil servant. \u201cWe want to stay in Europe, we really do. This was never about the euro vs the drachma.\u201d Instead, Greeks of all ages described in vivid detail how the country\u2019s wrenching austerity had brought ruin. Men and women who previously identified as members of the middle class spoke of personal devastation. In ways big and small, their lives had been torn apart by figures that had at first seemed abstract, but gradually become life-wrecking. \u201cThere was a time when I could go to the cinema or theatre or enjoy a weekend away,\u201d sighed Georgia, a dancing instructor in her 60s. \u201cNow I would have to think about doing any of that a hundred times because absolutely everything I have goes towards paying taxes. Today I said no. No more to this.\u201d Her friend Christiana, a 60-year-old retired historian, interjected. \u201cThis is not the Europe we dreamed of. This is not the Europe of enlightened thought, of solidarity, of egality, fraternite, liberte,\u201d she said, breaking into French. \u201cThis is the Europe that in this country has seen people go mad, has seen thousands commit suicide, has destroyed so many with the loss of jobs.\u201d But analysts said the vote was as much generational as class-induced. Young Greeks in particular, who have been especially hard-hit by policies that have deprived them of hope, are thought to have played a seminal role in the outcome. Joblessness among under 25s is above 55%. The plebiscite saw some 108,371 Greeks who had recently turned 18 voting for the first time. \u201cThe youth vote played a very big role. At least 80% would have voted no,\u201d said Aristides Hatzis, associate professor of law and economics at Athens university. In his bright green T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan \u201callergic to stupid people\u201d, Babis Kotsos, a 23-year-old barman, was one of them. \u201cMe and all my friends voted no because we honestly believe we have nothing to lose,\u201d he said. \u201cI agree, the no vote might be a risk but it\u2019s more of a risk for them. Not for one second do I think they are going to throw us out of the eurozone. What I think is that they are going to have to come to an agreement. A sensible agreement that deals with our debt, that is viable, that works.\u201d Katerina Arvanitis, who has just completed a master\u2019s degree in sociology at Athens\u2019 Panteion University, agreed. \u201cI have now completed my second degree and have absolutely no chance of work; basically I am being told to emigrate,\u201d sighed the 24-year-old. \u201cBut I want to stay here and I want to help my country. Of course our country needs reform, but not these measures. These are death, total annihilation.\u201d The Greek government\u2019s reaction was one of thinly disguised jubilation. Minister after minister said they hoped the vote would teach Europe a lesson. \u201cToday\u2019s no is a big yes to democratic Europe,\u201d the finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, declared. Panos Kammenos, the defence minister who heads the small rightwing Independent Greeks party backing the coalition government, went further, proclaiming that voters had resisted the temptation of giving in to a concerted campaign of fear. \u201cThis is a very important day for Greece but also for Europe,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cOn the one side, we saw ex-prime ministers [who appealed for a yes vote] and on the other side we saw the Greek people, who did not give in to fear, who proved that it cannot be blackmailed, it cannot be threatened.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
