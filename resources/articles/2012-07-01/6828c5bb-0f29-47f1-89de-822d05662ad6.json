I met a man I dated briefly, but it took a terrible turn when he kept me in a locked room for 24 hours, and repeatedly raped me. I returned home, said nothing and tried not to think about it. At times it would surface and I would feel rage, anger, disgust and hatred \u2013 towards myself and my attacker. I think everyone who looks at me can tell what happened. I did seek counselling of different kinds, but it didn't work and I don't know if I would benefit from it again. The problem is not the rape \u2013 the problem is that many years after, I told my mother. It was a mistake \u2013 she looked horrified and disgusted, and said: \"What did you do and why did you let that happen?\" It sounded to me as though she blamed me, and I already blame myself. Then she said: \"You must never tell your father.\" No words of comfort, no hug, no nothing. A 10-second conversation at best. I forgot about it. We have a fairly difficult relationship, my mother is highly controlling and schizophrenic but unmedicated, but now I have rising anger towards her, years later. It has got to the point where I don't want to see or speak to her. I'm so angry that she couldn't care more; that she was the one person I thought I could tell and would help me, but she did nothing. As we haven't discussed this since that day, she would not know that I feel this way. How can I get over this and treat her normally, and why is this bothering me now? Anonymous, via email I am so sorry that your mother didn't react in the way that she should have done. At a time when you needed reassurance and love, you got blame and disgust. Unfortunately, it's not the first time I've heard of family members not giving the response that was needed. I think what her reaction to you being raped has compounded in you is a feeling that you were never properly parented. If your mother didn't have mental-health issues I would advocate you write to her, with a view to sitting down and discussing this, and giving her another chance. But I fear that even if you did this, she might not give you the reaction you need because she may not have that in her. But I'd like to talk more about your father. Is your relationship with him any better? It was hard to gauge from your letter, and I wonder if you might feel able to approach him and discuss this, despite your mother's warning. You ask why this is bothering you now \u2013 sometimes big emotions surface when they can, when a person feels it's safe to let them out. And it sounds as if you've never been able to deal with these emotions and defuse them. You said you had counselling. I wonder if it was with someone who has experience of dealing with rape? I urge you to try it again. Not all counsellors are equal, and not all of them are used to dealing with rape survivors. I discussed your letter with with someone from Rape Crisis (rapecrisis.org.uk). The counsellor agreed that your mother's response was completely inappropriate, as if the rape were something to be ashamed of, something you shouldn't discuss, or somehow your fault. This is exactly the opposite of the response you should have got. Self-blame is something rape survivors struggle enough with. Unfortunately, although much progress has been made, we still live in a society that gives out the message \"don't get raped\" rather than \"don't rape\". You need to talk to someone who has experience of rape. Someone who can help you deal with your anger in an appropriate, healthy way. Rape Crisis said the anger you feel is a positive sign \u2013 it's entirely right you should feel angry, at being raped, at the stupid comments your mother made. They see anger as the step before healing begins. Do contact Rape Crisis. You will deal with a counsellor who is trained to deal with all your emotions. If you have a centre nearby, it will offer face-to-face counselling. If not (or if you'd prefer anyway) you can have phone (0808 8029999) or email (info@rapecrisis.org.uk) support. Whichever way, you can speak to the same person each week if you'd like to.
