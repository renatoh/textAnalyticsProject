We didn\u2019t need to engage with third parties; we thought we could do it ourselves.\u201d In the two and a half years since Darbon\u2019s arrival, the resurrection of the modern Saints has been quite something. Out of stale, stodgy mediocrity has sprung a team whose glass is now determinedly half full, even with many of the same players involved. The club\u2019s balance sheet is also far healthier, as is the prevailing mood around Franklin\u2019s Gardens. Saturday\u2019s visitors, Leinster, will find it a stark contrast to their past two European visits, which resulted in 37\u201110 and 40\u20117 away wins respectively. These are still early days, of course, but how has this transformation occurred? If you passed the understated Darbon in the street in his dark jeans and jumper, you might not necessarily notice the alchemist quietly reinventing the east Midlands pecking order. In a former life, though, he was responsible for trying to flog more whisky to China and was operations manager for London\u2019s Olympic Park in 2012; along the way he also spent time in New York promoting Tough Mudder endurance events. Selling a better brand of rugby to the converted must have felt like a comparative doddle. His first act, following the exit of the long-serving Jim Mallinder in December 2017, was to sift through the 60 CVs that arrived within 24 hours of the vacancy arising. One, from a well-known former international coach, pinged into his in-box within 19 minutes but Darbon was not seeking a shotgun marriage. \u201cWhen we started the search we were very clear about the criteria. Above everything else we wanted someone who had won something in the recent past. There are a lot of coaches out there that have never won anything.\u201d Also on the wish list were other specific qualities: experienced, good with young players, the ability to refresh a fading squad and an advocate of attractive rugby. The job description could virtually have been written for Chris Boyd, the board\u2019s eventual choice. The New Zealander had coached his country\u2019s under-20 side, presided over a champion Hurricanes team who scored tries for fun, and is no speak-your-weight coaching robot. \u201cChris was there on Skype in his hoodie and flip-flops, which he wears most of the time,\u201d Darbon recalls. \u201cBut when you speak to him you realise he\u2019s got a real clarity of thought: he\u2019s very structured and measured but he generally delivers it in quite a relaxed style.\u201d Boyd is also smart enough to know the first rule of enlightened head coaching: find yourself a super-talented assistant. When he asked various people to nominate the best young English attack coach the same name kept cropping up: Sam Vesty. The former Leicester and Bath back was coaching at Worcester but jumped at the chance to join the Boyd revolution. The pair swiftly decided it was a no-brainer to back the youthful talent of Rory Hutchinson, George Furbank, Tom Collins, Fraser Dingwall and James Grayson outside the electric Cobus Reinach. The rest is free-running, fast-paced history. It sounds so obvious in hindsight: Saints, despite their 2014 Premiership title during the Mallinder era, almost always respond positively to having a New Zealander \u2013 Wayne Smith, Wayne Shelford \u2013 in the vanguard. Boyd, like Darbon, is no fan of blinkered orthodoxy and tells a revealing story about his first meeting with the Wales fly-half Dan Biggar, signed by the previous regime and now trying to impress a coach more accustomed to having Beauden Barrett as his playmaker. \u201cI\u2019d never met him before and he\u2019d never met me. He\u2019s probably a little bit more conservative than I\u2019ve traditionally been used to as a playmaker but we mutually agreed that if we were open-minded and got it right we\u2019d have a good time together. If we didn\u2019t it would not be so good for either of us.\u201d Their unlikely relationship has blossomed to the point where Biggar rates the 61-year-old Boyd even more highly than his erstwhile Wales coach Warren Gatland. \u201cFor me Chris is by far the best coach I have ever been involved with. He\u2019s brought a real positivity and calls a spade a spade \u2026 there are no grey areas for him. I think if you asked any of the boys here they\u2019d have very little bad to say about Chris. I feel I get better every day in this environment.\u201d The next big question, even so, is whether the reborn, attack-minded Saints can unpick a tight, defensively-strong European unit such as Leinster? While Boyd is wryly amusing about the Irish provinces\u2019 ability to rest key men \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t understand how the Pro14 works particularly, but what I do know is the very best players don\u2019t play very much\u201d \u2013 his priority is to ensure Northampton do not revert to conservative old ways which he feels hold many English clubs back. Interestingly, he argues the continuing threat of relegation from the Premiership is among the biggest factors. \u201cRelegation is a great driver of theatre in a lot of English sport. In football whole towns celebrate the fact they don\u2019t get relegated. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll take relegation away or not but I\u2019d bet my house that, if they did, the average score would go up by 10-15 points straight away.\u201d Would that be an automatic improvement? \u201cIt has to be. In the next three-to-four years I guarantee it\u2019ll become more like American football. All that stuff, like throwing in a rag to protest, will come in because we\u2019re in the entertainment world now. TV rules, don\u2019t they?\u201d Under Boyd, though, Saints will not get too far ahead of themselves. \u201cWe are a nearly club because in 20 years we\u2019ve won one Heineken Cup and one Premiership. I was pleased with the way we played last week but we\u2019re not going to get that much time and space against Leinster. There are sides \u2013 and Leinster do it extremely well \u2013 who will kill you if you get too loose. The question is whether we can get enough scraps and turn them into gold. If we don\u2019t it\u2019ll be a long day at the office.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
