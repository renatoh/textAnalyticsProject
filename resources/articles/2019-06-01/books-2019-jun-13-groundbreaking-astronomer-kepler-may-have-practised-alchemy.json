A team led by biotechnologist Gleb Zilberstein and chemist Pier Giorgio Righetti has found very significant amounts of metals associated with the practice including gold, silver, mercury and lead on the pages of Kepler\u2019s manuscript about the moon, catalogued as \u201cHipparchus\u201d after the classical astronomer. Kepler, who died in 1630, drew on Copernicus\u2019s work to find laws of planetary motion that paved the way for Isaac Newton\u2019s theory of gravity. While he is known as a mathematician and astronomer, the historical record does not reveal whether he also studied alchemy \u2013 the ancient quest to transform base metals into gold or silver, cure disease and extend life. But a paper published in the chemistry journal Talanta describes how researchers used acetate films to discover metals that suggest Kepler \u201cmight have started practising alchemy\u201d. The authors speculate that Kepler could have learned the \u201cpseudo-chemical science\u201d from his colleague Tycho Brahe, the great Danish astronomer, in Prague. Brahe had invited Kepler to join him at the court of Rudolf II in Castle Benatky near Prague in 1600. When Brahe died in 1601, Kepler succeeded him as mathematician to Rudolf II. Alchemy, they point out, was still popular in the 16th and 17th centuries. Elizabeth I\u2019s scientific adviser John Dee was an alchemist, and Brahe built an alchemical laboratory on the island of Hven, with 16 furnaces and equipment for the purification of metals. When Brahe\u2019s body was exhumed in 2010, analysis of hair samples found they contained quantities of gold \u201cup to 100 times higher than in a normal person today\u201d. \u201cIt is highly likely that Brahe transmitted his passion to Kepler, who might have started practicing the art of alchemy,\u201d the paper continues, adding that it was likely \u201che was willing to get his hands dirty, as judged from the high levels of \u2018classical metals\u2019 used in this field on all pages of his manuscript Hipparchus\u201d and that \u201che not only had his fingertips contaminated by these metals, but also the sleeves of his garments\u201d. Zilberstein \u2013 who has previously found traces of kidney disease on the manuscript of Mikhail Bulgakov\u2019s The Master and Margarita, and analysed a letter of George Orwell\u2019s to suggest that he may have caught the tuberculosis that killed him while in a Spanish hospital \u2013 told the Guardian that examining texts and manuscripts with analytical chemistry can reveal \u201cinformation about what a person was eating, what this person was ill with, what medicines he used, what atmosphere he lived in\u201d. \u201cIt is very important to revisit the legacy of such people to find more about our history \u2026 These manuscripts are filled with amazing drawings and traces from the person who created them. If Kepler was an alchemist, then many processes that led to the formation of European culture, philosophy, science and industry can be understood.\u201d Unlike Brahe, there are no mortal remains of Kepler to test. The astronomer was buried in a local cemetery in Regensburg after dying suddenly of a fever aged 53. The cemetery was pillaged the following year during the thirty years\u2019 war, and his grave swept away. Just his epitaph, which he composed for himself, remains: \u201cI used to measure the heavens, / now I shall measure the shadows of the earth. / Although my soul was from heaven, / the shadow of my body lies here.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
