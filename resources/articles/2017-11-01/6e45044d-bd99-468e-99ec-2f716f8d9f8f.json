Just down the road, her main opponent, the Greens candidate Amy MacMahon, is celebrating with friends at another bar. But for now, West End, the suburb they both find themselves in, is a place of joy. It\u2019s a rare break to just be in the moment, during what has been a tough election campaign, with Labor keeping Trad \u2013 one of its better media performers \u2013 mainly within her electorate, sandbagging against a Greens\u2019 insurgency led by MacMahon. For this night, Trad is not the under-siege member for Brisbane. She\u2019s a member of a community that has just won a fight it has spent more than a decade preparing for. Her phone won\u2019t stop ringing. Names flash up from across the state. \u201cI\u2019ll call him back,\u201d Trad says to no one in particular. \u201cHe\u2019s probably scared you\u2019re losing,\u201d someone replies. Trad just flashes a smile at a glitter smeared face, which comes her way for a hug. \u201cNot tonight,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not about us.\u201d She leaves the bar as the song I Will Survive comes on. The next day, Brisbane ABC publishes video of Trad caught in a dance-off with a supporter on the footpath. But the night ends, and the election campaign is still going, and, come Thursday, Trad is still fighting for her political life. South Brisbane has always been political. But those politics are changing. Following the Greens\u2019 win in the local council elections in March 2016, with Jonathan Sri taking a ward with very similar boundary lines to Trad\u2019s state seat, the Greens are feeling energised. Coalition voters in this electorate may have a Liberal National party candidate running dead, but they are interested in the local message MacMahon is pushing. Trad has responded, lobbying her government for more levies on developers, setting aside land for green space and finding room for more schools. But perception can be brighter than reality. South Brisbane had the highest rate of any seat in the state enrolling or updating details for the same-sex marriage survey. Trad directed yes campaign fundraising, helping supporters get the word out to enrol. The end result, taking into account population growth, is an electorate with about 50% more enrolments than the last state election in January 2015. And a jump of just over 30% since the July 2016 federl election. It\u2019s a lot of new voters, and in a demographic most likely to vote for the Greens in Saturday\u2019s election. That has Labor worried, despite the 13.8% margin in the seat. But Trad, a Labor warrior from way back, has been in this position before. It was her job to convince a sceptical and battle-worn electorate that Labor still believed in it, after former premier and South Brisbane MP Anna Bligh reneged on her promise to stay in politics, quitting when Labor was reduced to seven seats following the Campbell Newman-led LNP slide of 2012. The Adani issue hasn\u2019t helped. While the Carmichael coalmine is still an attractive proposition up north, and seen in some areas as the economic saviour of central Queensland, the south-east has moved on from coal. But for Trad, who has been asked to explain Labor\u2019s position on Adani more often than most, the issues at play are bigger than the Carmichael mine. \u201cTaking action on climate change is a lot harder than saying no to one mine \u2013 it is actually about getting a national, coherent, consistent framework in place to meet our Paris requirements, and that is not happening,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you look at the whole debate around national energy policy and actual climate change and reducing emissions, it is, as Malcolm Farr said, a mad dog\u2019s vomit. So it is harder for people to engage in that arena. \u201cAnd to try and get an outcome that will see real changes around emissions reduction and our responsibility around action on climate change. That is really hard. \u201cIt is really easy to say no to this mine. But let me say, if Adani doesn\u2019t get finance, if Adani doesn\u2019t go ahead, our emissions are still increasing and there is still no consistent framework around national energy policy and reducing emissions.\u201d Trad goes on to talk about Labor\u2019s plan for 50% renewable energy by 2030. But she comes back to the Adani issue to discuss Palaszczuk\u2019s decision to remove the state completely from the process of Adani\u2019s federal loan application, after what she said was a planned \u201csmear campaign\u201d to highlight her partner Shaun Drabsch\u2019s role in preparing the billion-dollar loan application. \u201cI am incredibly proud of that decision,\u201d Trad said. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought that Adani should stand and fall on its own two feet as the premier has always said. \u201cI know that there are plenty of people right across Queensland, people who are pro-resource sector jobs, who actually don\u2019t want to see Adani get $1bn from Malcolm Turnbull. So, I am incredibly proud of the fact that we are not going to be participating in that.\u201d The Greens, and MacMahon, don\u2019t think it is enough. \u201cAdani is definitely an issue,\u201d she said. People are talking about this, in the context of this being another example where the government has left the people behind, where you have a big corporation which has gotten special deals, at the expense of local people.\u201d MacMahon points to Sri\u2019s council win as the turning point for the Greens, who have struggled in the past to get a toehold in Queensland\u2019s one-house parliament. \u201cI think it is partly because of this erosion of support for the two major parties, the sense of disillusionment that is really prevalent in the electorate,\u201d she said. \u201cI think in this area we are really lucky to have Jonathan Sri as the local councillor, who has demonstrated to people the power of having a Greens representative, what one Greens representative can do.\u201d It is not just South Brisbane. The inner-city seat of McConnel is considered vulnerable, while the LNP would-be treasurer and probable future leader Scott Emerson is fighting his own battle after a boundary change put his seat, Maiwar, under pressure. At the weekend the Greens took the Victorian state seat of Northcote, which sent a shiver across the Labor camp. For MacMahon, the demographic shift in South Brisbane opened a door. \u201cWe are connecting with people right across the electorate,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have been talking with lifelong Labor voters, lifelong LNP voters, who are feeling frustrated and are really excited by this new vision.\u201d For Trad, it\u2019s another battle in a career full of them. \u201cI don\u2019t take my community for granted,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been at the top of my mind. There are a lot of factors, and it\u2019s always tough, but I won\u2019t stop fighting for them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
