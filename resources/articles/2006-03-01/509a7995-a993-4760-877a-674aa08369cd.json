The reclusive millionaire writer took the witness stand for the first time at the court in London, where his publisher Random House is being sued over alleged copyright infringement. Authors Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh claim Mr Brown \"appropriated the architecture\" of their non-fiction book, The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, published in 1982. In a 69-page witness statement to the court, Mr Brown acknowledged reading the claimants' book but said he had not done so until the ideas and storyline of his theological thriller were already in place. Later, under cross examination at Court 61, which was packed with journalists and fans of his books, Mr Brown admitted he could not always recall exact dates of milestones in the creation of his novel. But he insisted the claimants' work \"was not a crucial or important text\" in the creation of the framework of The Da Vinci Code, published in 2003, adding that he was \"shocked\" by the claims. He said \"many\" books dealt with the idea that Jesus had been married to Mary Magdalene, that the couple had had a child and that the bloodline survives to the present day. He said he had read almost 30 other books relevant to the subject and more than 300 documents. \"I had never heard of it [The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail] until I'd seen it mentioned in some of our other research books,\" he said; allegations that he had plagiarised the book, or \"hijacked and exploited\" it, were \"simply untrue\". Mr Brown said he had gone out of his way to mention the book's authors, who he admitted had \"brought the [Mary Magdalene] theory to mainstream attention\". In his novel, Mr Brown said he named a character after the authors: Sir Leigh Teabing, an anagram of \"Baigent\" and \"Leigh\". He said he inserted the names in his novels only of people whom he respected or cared for. Other authors whose works he mentioned had sent letters of thanks, Mr Brown said, but the plaintiffs had made allegations that contained \"numerous sweeping statements which seem to me to be completely fanciful\". Mr Brown, dressed in a dark suit and yellow tie, said his novel had been written after joint research by himself and his wife at their home in Exeter, in his native New Hampshire. The couple met in California when he was a songwriter, before he became a full-time author. They married in 1997. Today the author appeared composed on the stand, only occasionally showing traces of impatience with the questioning of Rayner James, the counsel for the claimants, about documents and dates. \"It is as if you have asked me to go back five years or 10 years and asked me not only what I got for Christmas, but what order I opened the presents,\" Mr Brown said, admitting he could not recall the date he \"learned that Mary Magdalene was not a prostitute\". The copyright case has made headlines around the world. Lawyers, witnesses and the judge, Peter Smith, have pored over paperback copies of the two books and consulted related works such as The Templar Revelation and The Woman with the Alabaster Jar. Random House lawyers have argued that the ideas in dispute are so general they are not protected by copyright. They also say many of the ideas in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail do not feature in Mr Brown's novel. The Da Vinci Code follows fictional professor Robert Langdon as he investigates the murder of an elderly member of an ancient society that guards secrets about Jesus and the quest for the Holy Grail. The Holy Blood and Holy Grail, which is also published by Random House, has sold 2m copies and was the most successful book to claim that Jesus did not die on the cross until The Da Vinci Code arrived in 2003. Mr Brown's novel has now sold 36m copies, making it the world's biggest selling adult fiction book. The figure is set to rise further following the release of the film version starring Tom Hanks on May 19, although if the claimants are successful the film's release could be affected by an injunction. The third author of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, Henry Lincoln, is not involved in the case. Mr Brown is due to continue giving his evidence tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
