Along with the enthusiastic racket this tiptoe-quiet singer provokes in a club, it's fascinating to witness the growing confidence of her bands \u2013 there are two versions here, alternately including drummers Mark Guiliana and Kendrick Scott, both led by gifted pianist Taylor Eigsti \u2013 which Parlato clearly chooses for virtues that could run the gigs on their own, much as the late Betty Carter did. Herbie Hancock's Butterfly (a favourite Parlato vehicle) starts with abstractly sensuous gasps and sighs but winds up more muscular and dramatic than formerly, powered by the singer's strengthening technique and her empathy with the somewhat Mehldau-like Eigsti. Lauryn Hill's All That I Can Say is full of mysterious delays, the Brazilian Alo Alo is almost pure rhythm and yelpy birdlike sounds, Simply Red's Holding Back the Years is beautifully sympathetic to the song, Wayne Shorter's Juju takes the group close to Miles Davis mid-60s quintet territory, and Robert Glasper's arrangement of the resignedly trancelike Weak \u2013 the best track \u2013 finds Parlato at her most spontaneously, resourcefully soulful, as the hook winds on and on. It's a gem of a session."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
