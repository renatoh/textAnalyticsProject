It\u2019s meant to hurt'", "bodyText": "For a couple of years, Kyle Edmund has lurked like a kid at the edge of a playground scrap, not involved enough to get either a black eye or a round of applause but too big to ignore. It is time to talk about Kyle. In 40C heat on the shadeless Court No2, with a kicking gust that delivered no relief but plenty of mischief, Edmund earned the ultimate accolade from the head boy, Andy -Murray. The absent British No 1, nursing a hip he hopes will be healed in time for -Wimbledon, was impressed with Edmund\u2019s second five-set win in five days, this time in three and a half hours to beat the Georgian Nikoloz Basilashvili. \u201cWell done Kedders,\u201d tweeted Murray, who was watching on TV in the middle of the night in London. \u201cPhysical test passed. Mental strength passed. I reckon that\u2019s biggest win of @kyle8edmund career!\u201d Who is to argue? Not Leon Smith, who, as the Great Britain Davis Cup captain, will welcome Edmund to -Marbella on 2 February after his involvement in this tournament to lead the team against Spain, and was courtside to witness his 7-6 (0), 3-6, 4-6, 6-0, 7-5 win over a 25-year-old opponent near him in age and rankings but lacking the Yorkshireman\u2019s weapons. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a couple of times in the past where he\u2019s struggled in these sort of positions,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe\u2019s matured a lot, he\u2019s worked hard, but you\u2019ve got to go through it, put your body through it \u2013 and he did that. You could see he was managing himself, the way he was breathing between points. He was calm, composed.\u201d The issue with Edmund has never been his core talent or commitment. It has been how he maximises the power in his serve and forehand \u2013 as well as sharpening his focus in the big moments, an improvement that comes with age and increased fitness. On Monday he beat the 2017 US Open finalist Kevin Anderson in five sets. Then he outclassed Denis Istomin. Yesterday, although not at his best, he did a number on Basilashvili. Smith observed: \u201cThe first match against Anderson [who beat Edmund in five sets at Roland Garros last year] was a massive step. He\u2019d lost quite a few close matches against top 10, top 15 \u2013 Grigor Dimitrov the other week [in Brisbane], Rafa Nadal last year [in Monte Carlo]. He is getting a belief he belongs. Today was about showing heart, guts, courage.\u201d Smith also noticed stronger body language. Edmund, who has long been the quiet man of British tennis, seems to have grown in Murray\u2019s absence. \u201cHis body language, it\u2019s different. He is fist-pumping. I think because of his personality, he\u2019s probably had to go through a stage where it doesn\u2019t feel natural and it\u2019s a bit forced. It doesn\u2019t have to be \u2018Vamos!\u2019 after every single point. But, when he\u2019s realising it\u2019s a big moment in the match, he is turning to his coaching team and doing that.\u201d Edmund\u2019s challenge is to rebuild his energy stocks for the fourth round against Andreas Seppi, who beat Ivo Karlovic 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-7 (3), 6-7 (5), 9-7 in the sheltered evening shadows of Hisense Arena. Edmund reflected on the euphoria that washed over him after he beat Basilashvili. \u201cYour legs have been through a lot, especially in that heat. It saps the energy out of you. There\u2019s just release at the time and [happiness] I won \u2013 but feeling very tired.\u201dIf the umpire or referee had offered them a rest from the heat (in the pivotal, 20-minute second game of the fourth set, there were 15 deuces and eight break points), he would have taken it. \u201cFor sure,\u201d he said. But as he acknowledged in his press conference: \u201cIt\u2019s a professional sport. It\u2019s meant to hurt. It\u2019s not meant to be easy.\u201d Nick Kyrgios came through his stiffest test yet at the Australian Open, beating the former runner-up Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-6 (5), 4-6, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (5) to reach the fourth round. Both men hit 28 aces on Rod Laver Arena but the No17 seed, the lone Australian left in the men\u2019s draw, played his best when he needed to and he will face Dimitrov for a quarter-final spot. Tsonga had a set point in the third set and led 5-2 in the fourth-set tie-break but Kyrgios held firm. \u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Kyrgios said. \u201cI\u2019d never won a match on this court. Playing Jo, obviously I was very nervous. He was a guy I looked up to as a kid, I still do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
