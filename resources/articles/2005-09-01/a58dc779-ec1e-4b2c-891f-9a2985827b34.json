You what? When did we start talking about faded north Kent resorts like they are outposts of Notting Hill? Since the DFLs moved in, that's when. Whitstable's long fallen to the Down From Londoners; Margate's teetering, and what, even Herne Bay's succumbed? Where next? It's only a matter of time, Tankerton-on-sea. Arm yourselves! Ups The usual English seaside assortment: beach huts, faded caffs, grannies. If you can't afford Whitstable ... Ripe for down-from-Londoners to push up house prices. The Maunsell Forts: lonely, surreal leftovers from the last war, with local arty types trying to save them. Blue Flag beach. (Very) slowly regenerating; a great revived bandstand. Downs The usual English seaside assortment: misery, etc. The North Sea in winter. The pulse of up-and-comingness is pretty faint. The new wind farm is not eve~ryone's cuppa. Time out It ain't Ayia Napa, but some nice old boozers and a thriving local arts scene. Shopping: charity shops and purveyors of knitting wares. Getting around The A299 Thanet Way is pretty nippy to the M2. Rail-wise, an unnecessarily long 90 minutes to London (two/three trains an hour). Schools Some real good 'uns. The \"very effective and successful\" Herne CofE is the pick of primaries, says Ofsted. Herne Bay High \"good and improving\". Property A wonderful range, if in dowdy condition, like so many seaside resorts. A smattering of Regencies and Victorians, the odd art deco, pretty cottages and chalets out of your British seaside fantasies. And there's oodles on the market. Cheap, too. Beach huts a blinder at \u00a38,000, and there's a splendid chalet for \u00a325,000. One-bed over-the-shop flats from \u00a365,000; smarter one-bedders more like \u00a390,000-\u00a3125,000, two-bedders from \u00a3100,000. Terraces from \u00a3140,000. A little thatched cottage \u00a3190,000. Rather lovely bungalows (still Britain's favourite house type) on the sea from \u00a3150,000. Semis \u00a3150,000-\u00a3190,000 for big Victorians. Modern detacheds from \u00a3190,000. Five-bed Georgian town houses \u00a3240,000 (yes, you read right) to \u00a3500,000. Huge detacheds from \u00a3400,000. Agents on High Street: start with David Clarke, 01227 362248. Bargain of the week A two-bedroom 18th-century weatherboarded cottage in cute Herne Village that would probably fetch \u00a3400K in Southwold, but here is yours for all of \u00a3140,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
