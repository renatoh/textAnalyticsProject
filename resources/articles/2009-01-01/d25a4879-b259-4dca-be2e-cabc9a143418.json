From the reaction to the discovery of Rule11a of the FA Cup regulations you might think thieves had stolen the old pot and used it as a bed pan. This arcane bylaw states that clubs can agree to extra time rather than a replay, provided they do so within seven days of the draw being made. Only the richest outfits with major Premier or Champions League commitments would say no to a replay windfall, so Rule 11a is hardly likely to spread like dry rot. An Exeter City or a Kettering could simply decline to be party to such a carve-up, thus preserving the drama of the second chomp at the cherry. After his team's 2\u20131 victory over Spurs, Sir Alex Ferguson was incensed by the suggestion that Manchester United had sought to invoke the loophole, which was uncovered by Graham Poll, the former referee. In fact, Ferguson is defending the right of smaller clubs to take two paydays for the price of one. \"Scandalous\" was his description of one newspaper's \"Cup Killers\" headline. The organ concerned can expect a spell in the icy wastelands of Ferguson's displeasure. They can swap notes with the BBC. If the rule survives, though, you can bet your life a couple of big clubs will exploit it one winter's day. It might feel less calamitous than it sounds, given that the fixture list is absurdly over-crowded, or at least too expansive in the way it spreads across almost every hour of the week. A Mongolian journalist was accredited for this encounter, so some countries are evidently still mad for the world's oldest knockout competition. Given the chance, neither Ferguson nor Tottenham's Harry Redknapp could quite bring themselves to vandalise the round's most glamorous tie. Ferguson seized the chance to blood Fabio Da Silva, who went off injured, and the young Serbian Zoran Tosic, who impressed the audience with a busy second-half cameo. There was also a bow for a diminutive right-back whose name evokes a less cosmopolitan era: Richard Eckersley. Redknapp's grumpy threat to field \"the weakest team I feasibly can\" after the great Carling Cup escape at Burnley evaporated with his anger. Jermain Defoe's omission aside, there was no further undermining of the \"mish-mash\" he complained about, \"put together by I don't who and I don't know how\". The FA Cup holders went out at home to Swansea, but the manager who constructed that Portsmouth side was not about to concede a cricket score to the opponents Spurs face in the Carling Cup final on 1 March. Tottenham's players have absorbed enough dire warnings already: most of them from their own manager. Who could deny, though, that the tournament is widely assumed to be going the way of the Routemaster bus or the red telephone box? This theory has developed its own destructive momentum, certainly in the minds of many leading Premier League players. That might explain why the normally impregnable Nemanja Vidic allowed Roman Pavlyuchenko to beat him to a cross for Tottenham's fifth-minute goal, before United laid siege to Ben Alnwick's penalty area and struck through Paul Scholes and Dimitar Berbatov before the break. Redknapp has called this Tottenham squad \"not physically or mentally strong enough\", but he objected to a post-match allegation by Teddy Sheringham that his team lacked fighting spirit. One of their most ominous traits is to score and then clock off. Languor gets you nowhere in these parts. Then again, several visiting sides have committed the error of scoring early against United: an act comparable to thumping the young Mike Tyson below the belt in the first round. United's squad already shimmer with attacking talent. Down the age scale, classically constructed youngsters are pushing through. Fabio, Tosic and Eckersley all conform to that United stereotype of low-slung hustlers with good agility and close control. In Brazil and Serbia especially, Ferguson has found the kind of colts who can extend the club's aesthetic traditions once Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs have retreated to the hall of fame. Worth the candle also was the chance to take another look at Danny Welbeck, a leggy thoroughbred, and to observe the often underused brilliance of Carlos Tevez, who could give hairbands a good name. Few would want to watch this contest again in replay form, because it was too one-sided and lacked real dramatic tension. But there is plenty to commend a game that combines the proven talents of Tevez, Berbatov and Ronaldo with the promise of Tosic and Welbeck. Maybe the bigger knockout competition is becoming another finishing school. Perhaps it will come to be known as the Future Assets Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
