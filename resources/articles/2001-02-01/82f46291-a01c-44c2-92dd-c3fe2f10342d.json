Saturday's defeat here confirmed the stark contrast in the team's form at home and away, but left the phenomenon largely unexplained. If Chelsea are to embark on a late surge for a Champions League place this was the sort of fixture they needed to win. Certainly the circumstances appeared right for Chelsea's first away victory of the season in the Premiership. Leicester, dealt a body blow by the departure of Neil Lennon, their midfield rotor arm, to Celtic, had lost four of their previous five league fixtures. They were also in the process of trying to bring a spot of Italian finesse, in the person of the 36-year-old Roberto Mancini. For a time Mancini looked like a bottle of Frascati which had found itself in the company of brown ales. Chelsea's passing fizzed all around him while Leicester, when they were not giving the ball away, simply hoisted it forward to nobody in particular. It appeared a toss-up as to which would occur first: a goal for Chelsea or the withdrawal of Mancini because of a crick in the neck. Yet the first goal was scored by Leicester and the first Italian in his mid-30s to be substituted was Chelsea's Gianfranco Zola. Without Marcel Desailly, who had a calf strain, the vulnerability of Claudio Ranieri's defence to the kind of crosses which are Steve Guppy's speciality was likely at some stage to present Leicester with a scoring opportunity. All the more surprising, therefore, that Guppy was allowed so much room to produce a centre which glanced off the head of Frank Leboeuf on its way to the far post, where Muzzy Izzet headed Leicester in front after 24 minutes. From then on Leicester were a team transformed while Chelsea merely reverted to type. The problems which the vision of Zola and Dennis Wise, the aggression of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and the penetration on the left of Jesper Gronkjaer had been causing should have encouraged Chelsea to carry on regardless. Instead they seemed to regard another away defeat as inevitable. Their football became so passive that by the time an attack moved within scoring range it got lost in a thicket of bodies. Just past the half-hour Sam Dalla Bona found himself in space in the Leicester half but finding no one to pass to ended up attempting a hopeless shot from 35 yards. The moment summed up the moribund mood which has affected most of Chelsea's away performances this season. It might have been different had Hasselbaink managed to put away a loose ball after Simon Royce had half-stopped a shot from Zola two minutes before half-time. And to be fair to Chelsea they did draw level 15 minutes from the end when Wise's precise cross found the Leicester centre-backs looking at one another as Hasselbaink's head found the net. \"I think that Leicester played better than us,\" said Ranieri, \"though when we equalised I thought we could get a point or even win the game.\" Yet the time taken for this observation to be made and interpreted was roughly as long as it took Leicester to regain the lead. Matt Elliott further punished the aerial deficiencies of Chelsea's defence to glance on a free-kick from Robbie Savage for Gary Rowett, unmarked at the far post, to drive the ball past Carlo Cudicini. Leicester's win has revived Filbert's Street's hopes of European football next season although whether or not Mancini, signed from Lazio until the end of the season, is still around to participate will depend on how well Taylor feels he has fitted in. The quality of cross which set up Izzet for a second goal five minutes after half-time, only for the midfielder to head wide, was evidence of Mancini's enduring class, yet the Leicester newcomer who caught the eye more was Junior Lewis, a midfielder on loan from Gillingham, Taylor's previous club. Having lost Matt Jones, Lennon's replacement, through injury and suspension Taylor had to act quickly. Good management is as much about coping as coaching and the all-round strength of Lewis's performance proved the point. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
