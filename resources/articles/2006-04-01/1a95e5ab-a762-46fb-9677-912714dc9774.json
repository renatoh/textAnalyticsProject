This high-concept trio album brings together several tunes with druggy associations. Hendrix's Purple Haze is angsty and dynamic, while Gil Scott-Heron's Angel Dust becomes a romantic blues ballad. Chuck Rio's supper-club favourite Tequila prompts K\u00fchn to have fun reharmonising the cheesy tune's chords. K\u00fchn also supplies four originals (including a superb solo piece, Mushrooms) and plays alto sax on a couple of numbers. Poison is the kind of expert, brainy jazz best appreciated while completely straight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
