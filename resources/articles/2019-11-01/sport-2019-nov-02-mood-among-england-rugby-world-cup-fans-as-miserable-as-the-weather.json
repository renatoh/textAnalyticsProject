Supporters filled pubs up and down the country for the 9am kick-off, tucking into sausage rolls and pints of Guinness. The British Beer and Pub Association had predicted that 1m extra pints would be sold throughout Saturday if England were victorious. But in keeping with the wet and windy weather across parts of the UK, the game turned into a damp squib for Eddie Jones\u2019s side as South Africa\u2019s swept to victory 32-12. Handre Pollard\u2019s penalties and late tries from Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe made the difference, leaving England\u2019s dreams of lifting the trophy in shreds. Both the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn and Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, paid tribute to the England side on Twitter. Harpenden Rugby Club in St Albans, where three of the World Cup team \u2013 captain Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje and George Ford \u2013 trained, screened the game for around 350 fans. Tom Stagg, a fly-half for Harpenden, told PA: \u201cWhat can I say about this day that hasn\u2019t been already said about my grandma\u2019s funeral? It\u2019s sad, it\u2019s depressing and it\u2019s going to end with a few beers. \u201cWe have four ex-players from the club in the final, to lose is obviously very disappointing but it has been such a great trip and it has been awesome.\u201d Paul Wylie, 57, of Sevenoaks, said South Africa had been \u201cstrong and brutal\u201d. \u201cI was worried that we peaked last week because it was a massive thing to beat New Zealand,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir game today was too strong for us. They set their stall out and played a much tougher game. Getting to the final is a massive achievement in itself.\u201d Other fans had come out for the first time to see how England fared in the final, but left disappointed. Thomas Bishop, 30, said: \u201cI was expecting England to do better and they underperformed if anything.\u201d Dominic Maher, 34, added: \u201cIt\u2019s the final and I just came out for the atmosphere but England massively underperformed. They had a lot of spirit in the first half but in the second half it went downhill rapidly.\u201d Those watching belted out songs including Swing Low Sweet Chariot and Rugby\u2019s Coming Home, an anthem synonymous with last year\u2019s football World Cup that was adapted after England\u2019s emphatic win over New Zealand in the semi-final, which had raised expectations for Saturday\u2019s finale. Crewe &amp; Nantwich RUFC in Cheshire, where the England flanker Tom Curry and his twin brother Ben played until they were 16 \u2013 also screened the match. The vice-chair, Andy Pemberton, who helped to coach the twins during their time at the club, said: \u201cTo see one of your guys walking out, knowing he\u2019s played at the pitches here at Crewe &amp; Nantwich, is something special. The chest puffs out. \u201cYou see him belting out the national anthem and it brings a tear to your eye.\u201d Some supporters created Tom Curry masks. In the Warwickshire town of Rugby, which gave its name to the game, the landlord of the Merchant Inn, James Reeve, opened up early but is now faced with the prospect of England fans drowning their sorrows for the rest of the day. Thousands of England supporters had travelled the 6,000 miles to Yokohama this week, some in search of tickets for which they were willing to pay thousands of pounds. Prince Harry and Japan\u2019s Crown Prince Akishino. The prince did not, however, turn out to be a good luck charm for Jones\u2019 men, who were hoping to repeat England\u2019s 2003 triumph against Australia that turned Martin Johnson, Sir Clive Woodward and Jonny Wilkinson into sporting legends. ITV\u2019s coverage of the final was expected to attract a record television audience for a rugby match. The semi-final against the All Blacks peaked at 10 million viewers, almost three-quarters of the overall TV audience."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
