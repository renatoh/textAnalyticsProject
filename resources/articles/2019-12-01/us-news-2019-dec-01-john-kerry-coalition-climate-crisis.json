This coalition \u2013 named World War Zero, in reference to the national security danger presented by global heating \u2013 aims to convince people that rapid mobilization is required to halt the increase in carbon emissions within 30 years. According to United Nations scientists, global carbon emissions must be halved by 2030 \u2013 and eliminated completely by 2050 \u2013 to restrict warming to comparatively safe levels. The US and China are the top polluters in the world. While other countries are working to bolster the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate, Donald Trump has withdrawn the US from the pact. The bipartisan bloc includes Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, as well as moderate Republicans such as former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the New York Times reported. Celebrities such as Sting, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Ashton Kutcher are also among the some 60 original members, the newspaper said. Participants might favor particular policy approaches to cutting emissions \u2013 such as a carbon dioxide tax or federal environmental programs \u2013 but the group is not touting any specific initiative. During a Sunday morning appearance on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press, host Chuck Todd asked Kerry whether the real issue was getting Trump to act on climate \u2013 rather than raising awareness. \u201cWell it\u2019s not just the president, Chuck. There are great efforts out there, many environmental groups, young people, particularly, but no country is getting the job done,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cI mean, the simple reality is that we are way behind, way behind the 8-ball. Things are getting worse, not better. And so we have our unlikely allies coming together here.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no group that has people as diverse as ours in terms of nationality, age, gender, ideology, background, life experience and all of these people have come together saying, we\u2019ve got to treat this like a war,\u201d Kerry continued. \u201cBut with the desire to make certain that in America and around the world, people are going to put this issue way up at the top of the list. We\u2019re going to do the things we need to do, we\u2019re going to organize, we\u2019re going to mobilize, we\u2019re going to talk to literally millions of Americans over the course of the next months, and this is going to become a primary issue.\u201d Schwarzenegger said environmental advocates had to communicate more effectively \u2013 by discussing pollution, not global heating. Polling conducted by The Schwarzenegger Institute, which aims to impact public policy in a post-partisan manner, indicated the words \u201cclimate change\u201d didn\u2019t have all that much impact with Americans. \u201cI think the way to convince the whole world is by not just always talking about climate change, which doesn\u2019t mean that much to most of the people,\u201d he said on Meet The Press. \u201cWhen we said, \u2018climate change,\u2019 [to] the conservatives, there were only 17% interested and thought that there was a serious threat. But as soon as we said pollution, the numbers went over 50%.\u201d \u201cSo, we got to communicate. The environmental community has to communicate better and talk about pollution, because pollution is a threat right now.\u201d In Schwarzenegger\u2019s view, people aren\u2019t likely to think of threats decades in the future \u2013 impacting how the conversation should be framed. \u201cThey think about now. How can I survive? How can I provide jobs? How can I go and feed my family?\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the kind of issues and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we talk about the health issue.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
