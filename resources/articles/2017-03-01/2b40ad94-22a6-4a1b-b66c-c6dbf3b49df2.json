Or if you hated Love Actually first time round, so more of it is not funny at all. Perhaps you\u2019re uncomfortable with the sleb/slum juxtaposition, or you\u2019re not 100% convinced that the answer to poverty in Africa is Greg Davies shouting in a hot tub on the O2. But cast your doubt and cynicism aside, even if it\u2019s for one night only. Shut up, stick a red nose on\u2026 too much? Well, stick your hand in your pocket at least, dip into your stash. Fabulous opening sequence, a traffic jam dance routine, culminating in Ed Balls doing Gangnam Style. That\u2019s got to be worth a tenner already hasn\u2019t it? Text Yes to 70210. Inside the O2 Arena Lenny Henry and Jonathan Ross are dressed almost funereally in black suits. Or is that a hint of a comedy sparkly fleck in Lenny\u2019s \u2013 sorry, Sir Lenny\u2019s (and aren\u2019t you jealous Gary Barlow). Here are more famous faces, everyone basically, ranging in height from Warwick Davis to Greg Davies. Miranda Hart roams with a trolley of wonderment, barging in jollily. To LA, where there\u2019s more traffic, and James Corden has Take That in the Range Rover \u2013 Gary B in the front, Howard and Mark in the back, singing their own songs in Carpool Karaoke. Yeah, that works, especially the second part where James tries to finally break them in America: handing out CDs, asking people if they\u2019ve heard of them, doing a store performance in an optician \u2013 all small steps to the big time. It was probably a mistake for French and Saunders to do their take on Carpool Karaoke afterwards, with Jennifer as Bonnie Tyler, Gladys Knight and Skepta. But then Dawn and Jennifer are Red Nose Day, almost as much as Lenny Henry is. It\u2019s about the occasion and the history of the occasion, as much as it\u2019s about the material and the performance. And it\u2019s about the money, helping people in Africa and at home, have you called? \u201cCharity\u2019s boring though,\u201d says Catherine Tate as Lauren Cooper, who\u2019s gatecrashed a group of fundraising schoolchildren. (Grammar school kids: the PM \u2013 the real one, not Hugh Grant \u2013 will be pleased). \u201cCome on,\u201d say Lenny. \u201cIt\u2019s Red Nose Day.\u201d Exactly. The pre-cooked stuff is more successful than the live. Corden, Alan Partridge, Philomena Cunk, and Red Nose Day Actually. Live pizza-making, the world cup of biscuits and innuendo tennis are less successful, on television\u2026 hey, it doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s all brilliant. Ed Sheeran\u2019s in Liberia to find out, and to remind everyone, what it\u2019s all about. And to choke up. Then he\u2019s back in London SE10, to sing a song, do anything and everything he\u2019s asked to do really. He\u2019s going to get that knighthood before you Gary. And a sainthood. Ed\u2019s the new Bob. Give us your money, please. Get on that phone. 03457 910 910. Or go online."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
