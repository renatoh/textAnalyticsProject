The figures represent yet another educational milestone for females after an academic year in which they have outperformed males in GCSEs, A-levels, and now university finals. University admission figures last week revealed that females now make up 55% of new undergraduates with the best A-level grades. While for some time women have dominated the numbers of graduates securing upper seconds, men have always gained more first-class degrees. The annual trend helped spawn theories that male students excelled in exams - that they were less risk-averse than women who were more systematic, steady learners. All this has changed, as reflected in figures for the degree finals in 2000 just released by the Higher Education Statistics Agency. Just under 11,000 female students secured top class honours (almost 1,000 up on the 1999 figures), compared with 10,800 firsts for male graduates. Meanwhile, 67,500 females secured upper seconds compared with just over 42,000 males. The figures show that a higher proportion of men taking exams still secured first-class degrees. But as 54% of those taking finals were women, they now produce more firsts in total. The performance of women graduates is also improving year on year. More men than women were awarded the two poorest degree grades. Male graduates registered 8,400 thirds and 13,200 passes compared with 5,700 thirds and 12,200 passes for women. Overall, 265,000 undergraduate degrees were awarded to full-time and part-time undergraduates in UK universities. The figures represent another symbolic breakthrough for women students and make further uncomfortable reading for education ministers, who are concerned over the widening educational gap between the sexes. Julia Higgins, professor of polymer science, at Imperial College, London, welcomed the news: \"What would be most pleasing is if the results fluctuated each year.\" She said the results are likely to vary for different subjects. Diana Warwick, chief executive of Universities UK, said: \"It's good to see women graduating with such high honours in larger numbers. It is excellent news for universities that they are enabling so many more people, both men and women, to succeed.\" The number of undergraduates gaining degrees increased by 1% from 1999 to 2000. Of those gaining degrees in 2000, 8% got first-class honours, the same proportion as 1999. Just over 43% gained an upper second, compared to 42% in 1999. One in 10 graduates gained their award through part-time study. The results vary for different subjects areas and universities. At Cambridge, for example, where men still outnumber women in student enrolments, more men secure firsts. Just under 24% of male finalists gained firsts in 2000 - 1,234 in total, com pared with just 17% of female graduates - 701 in total. The numbers of women gaining postgraduate qualifications are also increasing faster than for men. Overall, 8% more postgrad degrees went to women in 2000 over the previous year. Over 64,000 women received postgraduate degrees, against 58,500 men. The biggest percentage increases among female postgrads were in computing science, veterinary science, humanities, and arts and design, up 30%, 22%, 17% and 17% respectively."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
