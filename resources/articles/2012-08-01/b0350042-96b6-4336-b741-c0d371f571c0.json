The piece, aimed at a family audience, with children and adult dancers, will tour before coming to the main Sadler's Wells stage next March. Duffy, renowned for her wry reinterpretations of classical myths and legends \u2013 including Mrs Midas, quite glad at her shiny new golden toilet bowl, but terrified of the prospect of a solid gold baby \u2013 is returning to the sinister original version of the story by the Brothers Grimm. A couple are forced to give away their longed-for only child to a witch, who locks her in a tower with neither stairs nor door, and a handsome prince who climbs up by her long tresses is blinded for his effrontery. Duffy is collaborating with musicians and artists who have recent form in delighting and terrorising viewers: costume design will be by Michele Clapton, who also works on the swords-and-sorcery television series Game of Thrones, and music by Murray Gold, whose recent work includes Doctor Who and Torchwood. \"It's the dream team,\" said Emma Gladstone, artistic programmer and producer at Sadler's Wells. \"Liv Lorent has been thinking about this project for some time, and when we first talked about it these are the people she really wanted \u2013 and amazingly we've got them all.\" Sadler's Wells recently won a \u00a3600,000 grant from the Monument Trust specifically towards commissioning new work. Gladstone said: \"There's so little ballet of substance for children, and this \u2013 with all the elements of body change, of puberty, of the awakening of desire \u2013 is a story full of potential. Rapunzel opens at the Durham book festival in October and then tours."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
