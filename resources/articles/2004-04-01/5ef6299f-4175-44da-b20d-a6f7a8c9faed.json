On the eve of the final Test starting today the selectors decided Chris Read's run in the side must come to an end and he has been replaced by Geraint Jones, who impressed with the bat in his only match of the tour in Barbados before the third Test. Doubt existed yesterday over the fitness of Ashley Giles, too, who did not train because of a stomach upset and may not be risked in Antigua's searing temperatures. Read, whose wicketkeeping throughout the winter has been as near faultless as it can get (24 byes and only one in this series), simply has failed to deliver the runs demanded from a No7 batsman. In the opinion of the captain Michael Vaughan, Jones, with his knock of 66, outplayed everyone but Graham Thorpe at the 3Ws Oval in Barbados and will be given a lengthy run in the side. Read, mightily disappointed, will, in Vaughan's words, \"have the chance to ram the decision down our throats\" in the one-day series that follows this Test, in which he is England's only keeper. \"Lord, me know arwe dun lose, but give arwe this wan nuh.\" On Good Friday of all days they were still praying in Antigua for the redemption of West Indies cricket. These are hard times for the people of a region whose love for the game remains undiminished through the toughest times they have been forced to endure. Losing has become endemic: in 75 years West Indies have been beaten 121 times and 49 of those defeats have come in the last decade, in a quarter of the total number of matches. They now face the final humiliation, a possibility - under the circumstances, make that a probability - that by Wednesday evening West Indies cricket will have reached its lowest ebb. England have won the first three Tests and deservedly so. Where the opposition have competed keenly for two days at a time, Vaughan's side have pulled away with all the power of a Ferrari leaving a 2CV standing once they were out of the speed limit. Twice the Australians have come to the Caribbean and won three Tests in a series: in 1954-5, when Ian Johnson's side took a five-Test rubber 3-0; and a year ago, when Steve Waugh won the first three of a four-Test series. But no one has had the temerity to close out an entire series here. It is the unthinkable, the last bastion breached. Lord, let it not happen. This, though, is Antigua, home to great West Indian warriors such as Sir Vivian Richards and Curtly Ambrose, Andy Roberts and Richie Richardson. At the Recreation Ground the spirit rubs off. Even in adversity mighty things have happened here for West Indies in the 18 matches since Richards marked the inaugural match against England in 1981 with a stunning and inevitable century and followed it up against them five years later with what remains the fastest Test century in history. It was here that Brian Lara broke Sir Garry Sobers' Test record score with 375 and here, too, a year ago that Waugh's ambition of a clean sweep came crashing down as West Indies went after an improbable 418 to beat Australia and made it with three wickets to spare, the highest of all successful run chases. England, in their time, have been battered by witheringly fast and mercilessly hostile bowling and suffered as Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes put together an opening stand of 298, the highest of their 16 century partnerships, which endedby a run out. In five Tests England have been heavily trounced three times and never won. Six years ago, in the aftermath of the last defeat, Michael Ather- ton resigned the cap taincy. For Lara's despondent side those are all things on which to draw. They will be helped by the pitch which, by repute, is for batsmen. Adjacent to the ground is the Antiguan prison and years ago an inmate was slowly and relentlessly rolling the strip. \"How long you been doin' that?\" he was asked. \"'Bout 10 years, man,\" he replied, \"10 long years.\" It will help West Indies to compete if their batsmen, who have proved almost incapable of coping with the England pace bowlers on the sporty surfaces in Jamaica, Trinidad and Barbados, if he has been rolling it since. With the series gone, this is about damage limitation and salvaging pride. To do that, first and foremost they need runs on the board from players who are eagle-eyed, massively talented but in some instances technically ill-equipped to cope with anything but the truest of pitches. Their exuberant young pace attack then will have something at which to bowl. For this match Shivnarine Chanderpaul has been sent back to Guyana for medical tests after complaining of fatigue and lethargy and has been replaced by the local boy Sylvester Joseph, whose batting (36 and 50) against England in that match at 3Ws has earned him a debut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
