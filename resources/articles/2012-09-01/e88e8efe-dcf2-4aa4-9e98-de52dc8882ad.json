How poignant, then, that one of their favourite old boys should have returned on such an occasion to steal the show. Time has yet to dull Charlie Hodgson's edge. He collected 18 points in Saracens' 23-16 victory and generally upstaged the man who would replace him. \"He's slightly quicker than me, Cipriani,\" Hodgson said, with that shy smile of his, referring to a moment in the first half when Cipriani, having been charged down by Hodgson, turned and caught him to prevent a certain try. There is no doubt that the younger man is quicker of foot, and on this occasion enjoyed a better strike rate with his shots at goal, which is to say that he kicked four out of four in reply to six out of eight, but in every other department it was Hodgson's day. He will be 32 in November and his England days are over. The impression remains that his international career never hit the heights that it might have. He was handed the most unenviable of hospital passes in English rugby's history, by having to replace the man, Jonny Wilkinson, who had just won England's first World Cup before he went missing with injury. Twickenham Man never took to Hodgson but at Premiership level his achievements are unmatched. Last weekend he became the first man to pass 2,000 Premiership points. The next best, Andy Goode, is nearly 400 points behind. On Saturday, he orchestrated a classic Saracens victory: intense, focused and, when the moment came, deadly precise. \"I thought for the first 25, 30 minutes of the match we were massively in control,\" said Mark McCall, their director of rugby. \"We built a 12-3 lead. It could have been more.\" That said, it could have been less too. Hodgson's second penalty was a travesty perpetrated against Cipriani. A beautifully precise buildup worked Chris Ashton into Sale territory but his pass to Richard Wigglesworth, another former Sale man, was behind the man and into touch. The referee, Dave Pearson decided that Cipriani, who had lunged for the ball, had deliberately knocked it down. In truth, he was nowhere near it. Cipriani appealed to him to refer it upstairs, as, technically, the referee now can. But Pearson, as is his way, was sure of himself, and, anyway, is not allowed to act on the appeal of a player. So that penalty should never have stood and Sale were once again a little hard done by towards the end of the half, when they were in the ascendancy. Sam Tuitupou was taken out brazenly by Brad Barritt as he chased Cipriani's chip into the Saracens 22. That was referred upstairs and the foul play confirmed but Sale's reasonable appeals for a yellow card were dismissed. It is early days yet in the experiment to extend the powers of the television match official but it seems the greater his remit, the less he can keep everyone satisfied. Sale closed to within three points at the break and then scored a breakaway try through Will Addison at the start of the second half to open up a 16-12 lead but it was Saracens who dominated the rest of the match, culminating in a fine try by Ashton on the hour, worked into the corner masterfully by Hodgson and Alex Goode. At least a bonus point represents progress for Sale, after last week's 40-point defeat to Exeter. \"I thought we were a lot better than last week, which was the key thing,\" said Bryan Redpath, their director of rugby. \"But we lacked a little bit in confidence in certain parts because of last week's drubbing.\" Sale's players are better than this but it is a new adventure for them, which will surely improve. How they could do, though, with a man like Hodgson in the middle of it all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
