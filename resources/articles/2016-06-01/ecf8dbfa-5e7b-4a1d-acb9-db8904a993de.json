The company, founded by Bill Gates, announced a partnership on Thursday with Kind Financial, a Los Angeles firm that sells computer systems to governments that track legalized marijuana sales. Microsoft, which is headquartered in Washington, a state where recreational cannabis is now legal, is licensing Kind to sell Microsoft cloud services to authorities to monitor sales \u2013 rather than becoming directly involved in the trade itself. Kind, founded in 2013, sells pot tracking software to growers, sellers and governments. But even the cannabis company recognizes the foundations of its business is controversial in some quarters. Its website is strait-laced and includes no images of the multi-tipped leaf synonymous with getting high. And as its CEO, David Dinenberg, stressed repeatedly during a brief interview, \u201cWe absolutely do not touch the plant.\u201d However, Microsoft has still created a milestone in America\u2019s slow progression towards accepting marijuana, which remains illegal under federal law. For that reason, many banks will not work with companies involved in the regulated pot industry. Some 25 states allow the sale of marijuana in certain circumstances, mostly with a prescription or license from a doctor. At least four states plan to vote this fall on following Washington, Oregon and Colorado in permitting recreational use of the drug. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty substantial day of legitimacy, I believe, for the industry as a whole,\u201d said Dinenberg. In the past, he has explored partnerships with companies who wound up being \u201ca little apprehensive to hear what the mainstream client would think\u201d. Kind will pursue government pot compliance contracts by pitching Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud services. Microsoft\u2019s government sales team will work with Kind in bidding on those contracts, Dinenberg said. Kind and Microsoft have already bid on a contract in Puerto Rico, which began allowing medical use of marijuana this year, Dinenberg said. \u201cKind agreed that Azure Government is the only cloud platform designed to meet government standards for the closely regulated cannabis compliance programs,\u201d said Kimberly Nelson, Microsoft\u2019s executive director state and local government solutions. \u201cWe look forward to working together to help our government customers launch successful regulatory programs.\u201d \u201cWe go after the contract and we are able to use the Microsoft sales team,\u201d Dinenberg said. \u201cThey use their political connections. We use ours.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
