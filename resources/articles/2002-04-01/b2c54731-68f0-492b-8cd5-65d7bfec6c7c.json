The England manager is determined to name his strongest possible line-up for the final friendly before he names his 23-man World Cup squad, but with the Premiership title race so delicately poised and one English club still in the Champions League few starters are likely to finish the game. The policy of making extensive substitutions at half-time may please the likes of Sir Alex Ferguson and G\u00e9rard Houllier but it will not be greeted so warmly by fans who have paid to see the game at Anfield. With last month's friendly against Italy at Elland Road ending with both sides fielding virtual reserve teams the Football Association may consider reducing ticket prices for some friendlies to appease frustrated fans. The Fulham striker Barry Hayles has been cleared to play in this weekend's FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea despite being given a three-match ban by the FA yesterday - though he could still miss the final. Hayles was charged with violent conduct by the FA after an incident involving the West Ham defender Hayden Foxe last November. Foxe was cleared of a similar charge but Hayles pleaded guilty. Fulham, however, are unhappy with the sentence and are considering an appeal, and the suspension will not begin until they decide. This clears Hayles to play in this weekend's Cup semi-final as well as league games against Leeds, Bolton and Leicester, but if the ban is upheld Hayles would miss the last Premiership game of the season as well as the final. The Chelsea chairman Ken Bates has insisted that his manager Claudio Ranieri will not be taking over at Barcelona next season. Rumours at the weekend suggested the Italian was at the top of the Catalan club's list to replace Carles Rexach, but Bates yesterday insisted: \"He ain't going there - it's as simple as that. \"Claudio is enjoying his job here. He feels that he has turned the team from the one he inherited into his own side. So we can assume he isn't going anywhere.\" Burnley have said that Paul Gascoigne will return to training today, after speculation that the veteran midfielder had walked out on the club after he was left out of last Saturday's 2-0 win over Gillingham. They have also announced that David Johnson's loan from Nottingham Forest has been extended until the end of the season. The former Blackburn and Internazionale manager Roy Hodgson has been appointed coach of the United Arab Emirates national team. Sunderland made an operating loss of \u00a3181,000 for the six months to January 31. \"We remain fully committed to our strategy to take Sunderland forward and short-term setbacks will not affect us achieving long-term and sustained success,\" said the Sunderland plc chairman Bryan Sanderson. The World Cup referee Hugh Dallas will take charge of this year's Scottish Cup final, between Celtic and Rangers on May 4. The Scotland manager Berti Vogts has defended his decision to name the former England Under-21 full-back Robbie Stockdale in his squad for the friendly against Nigeria on April 17. Stockdale is joined in the 25-man squad by Preston's Coventry-born defender Graham Alexander. \"Robbie was young when he played for England and he's changed his mind,\" said Vogts. \"If you look at the French [to whom Scotland lost 5-0 last month] nine of their players were not born in France and they are playing for them.\" Meanwhile Vogts announced that Scotland's Far East tour has now been confirmed. Scotland will play South Korea in Busan on May 16, then two matches in the Hong Kong tournament on May 20 and 23. Scotland squad: Douglas (Celtic), Gallacher (Dundee Utd), Sullivan (Tottenham), Caldwell (Newcastle), Crainey (Celtic), Dailly (West Ham), Davidson (Leicester City), Matteo (Leeds), McNaughton (Aberdeen), Ross (Rangers), Weir (Everton), Alexander (Preston NE), Ferguson (Rangers), Gemmill (Everton), Hughes (Rangers), Lambert (Celtic), Stewart (Manchester Utd), Stockdale (Middlesbrough), Williams (Nottm Forest), Crawford (Dunfermline), Dickov (Leicester), Johnston (Middlesbrough), McCann (Rangers), O'Connor (Hibernian), Thompson (Dundee Utd). \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
