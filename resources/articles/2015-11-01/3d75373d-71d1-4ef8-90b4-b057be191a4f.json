The event gave honorary Oscars to Debbie Reynolds, Gena Rowlands and Spike Lee, while also serving as a fertile campaign ground for those hoping to be nominated for an Academy award themselves. Here\u2019s what we gleaned from the evening and its satellite events. Hollywood was once again called out for its lack of diversity \u201cWe need to have some serious discussions about diversity and get some flavour up in this,\u201d film-maker Spike Lee said, in accepting his honorary Oscar . \u201cThis industry is so behind sports, it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d In a 15-minute speech, Lee passionately recounted how he got his start as a film student at New York University, where he is now a tenured film professor. \u201cMy parents told us from a very early age that I had to be 10 times better than my white classmates; that just being the same would not be enough,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThat was instilled in me from the beginning.\u201d Lee, sporting gold \u201cOscar edition\u201d Air Jordans, warned Hollywood to \u201cget smart\u201d about diversity. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but the US census bureau says that in year 2043, white Americans will be the minority in this country,\u201d Lee said. \u201cOur workforce should reflect what this country looks like.\u201d His sentiments were echoed earlier in the show by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, who opened the evening by urging her colleagues to make major changes in the workforce. \u201cYou understand that when it comes to fair and equal representation, words are not enough,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also have a responsibility to take action \u2013 and we have a unique opportunity to do so now. The world is watching to see how we respond to this critical issue.\u201d Lee and Isaacs\u2019 words come in the wake of a recent study that gives further evidence of persistent inequality in Hollywood. It found that among the top 100 movies last year, 73.1% of all speaking or named characters were white; 4.9% were Hispanic; 12.5% were black; and 5.3% were Asian. None starred a female actor older than 45. Paris weighed heavily on the events On Friday, the night before the Governors awards, a number of Hollywood studios hosted parties to hype their Oscar hopefuls. Universal brought out the Straight Outta Compton cast for its shindig, while Fox Searchlight ensured Saoirse Ronan was present to tout her performance in Brooklyn. Mere hours before the events got under way, news broke of the Paris terror attacks. The parties went on as planned, but the tragedy loomed large. One studio had considered canceling their event but decided against it, it said, to send a message of resilience to the film industry. In her opening remarks at the Governors awards, Isaacs addressed the attacks, saying: \u201cAll of us here stand in solidarity with France and the French people.\u201d Late divas were remembered Accepting her honorary Oscar, Gena Rowlands spent most of her speech recounting an interaction with her all-time favourite actor, Bette Davis, with whom she worked in 1979, on the television movie Strangers: the Story of a Mother and Daughter. Apparently, Davis tried to have cinematographer James Crabe fired because the All About Eve star was aghast at how orange her lipstick appeared on screen. Room star Jacob Tremblay is Hollywood\u2019s new darling The youngest person in the room at the Governors awards was also the one everyone wanted to meet the most. Nine-year-old actor Jacob Tremblay, the breakout star from Room, sat next to Brie Larson, his onscreen mother in the film. Everyone from Will Smith to Johnny Depp made their way to his table to pay their respects to the burgeoning talent. Tremblay took the adulation in stride, telling the Guardian he was just excited to be wearing his first-ever tuxedo for the occasion. Laura Linney proved to be one of Hollywood\u2019s finest Laura Linney is proof that even Hollywood\u2019s A-listers can be victim to the lack of diversity in the industry. With three Oscar nominations, two Golden Globes and four Emmys to her name, Linney was among the most celebrated attendees. And yet in the two years since she ended her four-year run on her award-winning Showtime series The Big C, Linney has only appeared in supporting roles in The Fifth Estate and Mr Holmes. Most distressingly, she\u2019s next slated to star opposite Megan Fox in the sequel to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Paying tribute to Rowlands, with whom she worked on the 2000 television movie Wild Iris, Linney outshone both Meryl Streep and Cate Blanchett, to deliver the evening\u2019s most heartfelt and fiercely delivered tribute. Streep, on hand to honor Reynolds with a humanitarian honorary Oscar, read the two teleprompters dutifully, but appeared oddly nervous and stilted. Jane Fonda is ageless Leave it to 77-year-old actor Jane Fonda to wear the most revealing outfit at the Governors awards \u2013 and rock the look with abandon. The fitness maven looked magnificent in a see-through black blouse under a fitted gold jacket. Wesley Snipes is fearless The actor elicited as many gasps as he did laughs in introducing Lee while speaking in a put-on thick African accent. \u201cThis Spike Lee comes from a village in Africa called Brooklyn,\u201d Snipes joked, before going on to recount how he and Lee were once not allowed into the Governors Ball following the Oscars ceremony a number of years back. \u201cThis is about perseverance and patience,\u201d Snipes said, \u201cbecause look at this here! They didn\u2019t want you to come upstairs before, but now they\u2019re giving you an award.\u201d The Blade Runner reboot is at the storyboard stage At a lunch for Sicario, the drug war thriller starring Emily Blunt that\u2019s been courting Oscar buzz since its premiere at Cannes, director Denis Villeneuve worked the room of Academy voters. He was accompanied by Blunt\u2019s co-star in the film, Benicio Del Toro and cinematographer Roger Deakins, with whom he\u2019s next collaborating on a reboot of Blade Runner, set to star Ryan Gosling. Villeneuve told the Guardian that he\u2019s presently holed up in a hotel room in Montreal with Deakins working on the storyboards for the film\u2019s pre-production phase. Ian McKellen is campaigning hard Of all the actors gunning for recognition in the best actor field, few have campaigned harder than McKellen, who stands a good shot at netting a nomination for his work in this summer\u2019s sleeper hit, Mr Homes. The morning after the awards, he was feted at a brunch hosted by the British consul general, attended by Kathy Bates and McKellen\u2019s friend Patrick Stewart. On Thursday, he is set to perform a monologue in Los Angeles about his favourite female co-stars. Spotlight is still the favourite to win best picture A dinner in Beverly Hills was hosted in Spotlight\u2019s honor on Sunday night. Since debuting at the Venice film festival, Tom McCarthy\u2019s dramatisation of the Boston Globe\u2019s efforts to uncover a massive child abuse cover-up within the local Catholic archdiocese, has been leading the Oscar charge. McCarthy was joined by his star from the film, Michael Keaton. According to Academy voters the Guardian spoke with, the only efforts that stand a shot at upsetting Spotlight\u2019s chances are The Martian and two films that have yet to be seen: David O Russell\u2019s Joy and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s follow-up to Birdman, The Revenant. The Hateful Eight is long. Really long Quentin Tarantino\u2019s eighth film The Hateful Eight doesn\u2019t open until Christmas Day, but on Saturday, hours before the Governors awards got under way, the Weinstein Company screened the film for a number of Academy members. Some said that the film was a slog to sit through, and at a butt-numbing 3hrs and 2mins that doesn\u2019t come as much of a surprise. To offer respite for the viewer, the film will feature an intermission period, lasting around 12 minutes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
