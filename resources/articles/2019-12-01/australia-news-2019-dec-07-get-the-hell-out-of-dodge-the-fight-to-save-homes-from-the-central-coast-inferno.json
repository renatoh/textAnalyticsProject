He\u2019s bleary eyed and sooty, having helped keep one of eight current emergency fires in New South Wales from destroying the home of his daughter and her family. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a relief,\u201d he says. \u201cYou sit here waiting for it for days and when it does come you think \u2018You beaut, now it\u2019s gone\u2019. But you feel sorry for the poor people who have lost their homes. And animals of course. Heaps of horses [around here].\u201d As he talks the smoke swirls in eddies, unable to decide which direction it wants to go. It\u2019s been the theme of the day. Erratic wind changes had sent the fire at Wrights Creek one way, only to drive it back another way with interest. Not long after lunchtime it roared past the central coast property, then turned around and went back down the other edge. Collis\u2019s son-in-law, Shane Hilson, points at a line of trees on the edge of his furthest paddock. The ground is black and he says the tops were ablaze just a short time ago but he was prepared and got lucky. A neighbour lost a shed, he says. Collis says he heard a series of loud bangs over the hill and assumed it was someone\u2019s gas bottles. Asked if their place is in the clear now, Hilson laughs a little. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left to burn.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment voiced more than once on Friday. This small rural community just an hour-and-a-half from Sydney has been on the hook for weeks. Like much of NSW, where fires now stretch the entirety of the coastline, these fires started back in the spring, in unseasonable weather during a devastating drought amid unprecedented fire conditions. Six people have died and almost 700 homes have been destroyed in NSW bushfires this season. More than 100 fires were burning on Friday, more than half of them out of control. Up the hill, the driveway of Rob Meggs\u2019s home is ash, the trees are black, a pile of glowing logs sits in a clump like an abandoned campfire. He\u2019s been in his house 22 years and hasn\u2019t seen anything so big. \u201cI\u2019ll still continue to live here, now that this has been through it\u2019s probably good for another 50 years,\u201d he says. Meggs\u2019s large iron shed and adjacent office have crumpled, folding in on themselves and encasing the still-burning fire inside. The shed was \u201ca hoarder\u2019s heaven\u201d, he says. \u201cIt was chockers full of stuff. That might be a release in one way. But my office, that might be a bit more painful. It had some records in there that I won\u2019t be able to replace.\u201d Meggs keeps a distance from the ruins, saying he thinks all the petrol cans have blown up by now, but there might still be some paint tins to go. The fact that his house survived is spoken of by some firies on Friday as a sight to behold. His long single-level house with a pool is untouched while the surrounding forest smokes. It\u2019s eerie, and the smoke hangs thick between the gusts. Residents are weary and jaded, joking with each other, but far from complacent. Not far from here, five other emergency level fires merged into what tabloids have dubbed a mega blaze, having burned through more than 335,000 hectares. By midnight Wrights Creek would also join. A group of men hang around the Kulnura\u2019s general store, nursing beers. They say they\u2019re not worried, but they\u2019re also not going to stick around if it goes south. \u201cYou get to a certain point and then you just get the hell out of Dodge,\u201d Steve says. \u201cI think everyone\u2019s just prepped for a certain level but you can\u2019t go beyond a certain point unless you concrete your whole [home],\u201d says Robbie, from Bucketty, where he\u2019s surrounded by at least half a dozen different fires. \u201cWe all live in the bush and it comes with the bush.\u201d Steve says he spoke to a friend in Grafton who stayed to defend his home but it was overwhelmed by fire and he had to jump in the river to save himself. \u201cHe said he\u2019ll never protect his house ever again,\u201d he says. \u201cHe said he\u2019ll just drive away, it was the scariest thing he\u2019s ever been through. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth going over stuff and that\u2019s all it is, it\u2019s stuff. \u201cBut at the same time you\u2019d be really disappointed if your house burnt down because of embers or a spot fire.\u201d He says the biggest problem for him is the windy single road in and out, through the bush. \u201cThe other thing is, I think everyone is genuinely absolutely pissed off with the government. Because they\u2019ve shortchanged fire services. They knew this was coming. For two years they\u2019ve know this shit was coming and they gutted the budget. \u201cVolunteers working around the clock. Really? They\u2019re losing all their wages and everything like that.\u201d Firefighters up here are tired and overstretched. Every property owner says their home \u2013 and maybe even themselves \u2013 wouldn\u2019t still be here if not for the Rural Fire Service (RFS) and metro firefighters, but in nearly every following breath they ask why so much is up to volunteers. RFS firefighters Ian Woolley, Eric Lambeck, and David Horan were taking an evening breather on the edge of a property looking west as the rolling hills slowly disappear one by one behind thick brown smoke. The three men are from the local RFS brigade and spent the day defending the homes of themselves and their neighbours. The wind has changed again, and now a southerly is pushing the fire back towards Kulnura, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t change again\u201d, Horan says. \u201cWe just hurry up and wait,\u201d Woolley says. Inside the house Narelle Davis and Jill Gilbert sit at a kitchen bench with a couple of glasses of wine with ice, while some sausages cook on the stove. They have been on edge and have not slept properly in a week. Three men sit at the table, two dogs run around the yard, and Mim the kangaroo looks quite at home on a blanket in front of the TV. Davis raised the kangaroo before releasing her and she normally hangs round in the bush nearby but came back home when the fires came close and the family brought her inside. Davis grew up here and the house was built to weather a fire. \u201cSince it started the last three weeks, we\u2019ve even knocked down half my garden \u2026 That\u2019s all you can do.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not about being relaxed, it\u2019s about being prepared,\u201d says Gilbert, who grew up in the Blue Mountains but now lives over the road. \u201cAnd not being naive,\u201d Davis says. She says they have been warned by the fires there\u2019s a good chance they will be hit by both the Wrights Creek and the Three Mile firefronts at the same time but the winds are all over the place. \u201cThat\u2019s the trouble with Mother Nature, you just don\u2019t know.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
