Having spent most of this season under-achieving, Wolves were brilliant last night, especially in the first half when they thoroughly outplayed an Ipswich team which would have moved into second had they won. For those to whom Wolves' record of 14 draws in 19 games under Glenn Hoddle suggests a team that might have sacrificed flair for defensive solidity, the opening period had to be seen to be believed. Playing a fluid attacking system which saw Seol Ki-Hyeon, Seyi Olofinjana, Colin Cameron and Kenny Miller breaking in rapid support of Carl Cort - so rapid in fact that they often left the centre-forward behind - Wolves simply ripped the visitors apart. Seol had already curled a shot a foot wide with Ipswich's goalkeeper Kelvin Davis beaten when, after four minutes, they took the lead. The Ipswich defence failed to deal with Lee Naylor's low cross from the left, a panicky attempted clearance setting the ball up nicely for Cameron to thump high into the net. Miller almost made it two a minute later, Davis saving bravely and brilliantly as the Scot tried to turn in Seol's cross from the right. The Korean's skill, and his intelligent use of the ball, gave Ipswich a stream of problems down the rightand Olofinjana and Cort should both have taken advantage before Wolves scored again. Again it was made down the left, Naylor picking out Cameron's run and Cort turning in his pull-back. It was as well as Wolves have played all season but Ipswich are a team that, for all their notorious vulnerability, always make chances of their own. A minute after Cort's goal, Ian Westlake rattled Michael Oakes' bar with a volley from the edge of the penalty area and just before half-time Shefki Kuqi clipped the post with the goalkeeper well beaten. Ipswich's manager Joe Royle made two changes at half-time and Wolves were never likely to maintain the standards they had set in the first period. Reverting to type, they allowed themselves to be pressed back. Darren Bent's pace began to cause problems but, when Jim Magilton's through-ball put him clear, the young striker lifted his lob over the bar. For all the crowd's nervousness a concerted spell of pressure never really materialised. Ipswich looked tired as well as out of sorts and only Davis's superb save stopped Seol from extending the home side's lead in the final minutes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
