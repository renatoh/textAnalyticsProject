And yet, by accident or design, lack of clarity bedevils the system. Take a mundane exchange the other day about the government's drive for localism. The minister Nick Boles was taking questions. As is the tiresome tradition, members on his side of the Commons were lobbing softballs at him. \"There are neighbourhood plans in Chalford, Dursley, Eastington and nearly a dozen other areas in my constituency,\" boasted Stroud MP Neil Carmichael. \"Does the minister agree that a good neighbourhood plan is an appropriate protector against inappropriate developments?\" And Boles did agree \u2013 but how can there be a dozen plans in Stroud when there are only a handful in existence, voted through by referendums, in England and Wales? \"There actually aren't any,\" one puzzled constituent said. \"It was a puff question to support the coalition's planning policy.\" Can that be so, we asked Carmichael. \"None have had the vote yet, but some are close,\" he said. \"I should have corrected it at the time. I should have said there are neighbourhood plans under way.\" Indeed. No one wants the House misled. \u2022 Let freedom ring, and one guesses it will at Bournemouth's Freedom Festival. Soldiers of the right and champions of libertarian thought gather \"for an amazing weekend\". But that freedom can't apply to everyone. And thus, organisers in the Freedom Association find themselves having to ban the perennially troublesome rightwinger Claire Khaw \u2013 expelled from the BNP and then the Conservative party. \"I was prepared for you to attend,\" writes chief executive Simon Richards. But other groups are involved. \"Your presence has indeed proved a problem for some of those organisations.\" And it's not just Khaw. Martin Sewell, the unlovely former Cambridge supervisor who argued that black people were \"impulsive\", with lower IQs, is also getting his ticket money refunded. Who objected to us, demands Khaw. We are not at liberty to tell you, said the chief exec. Without irony, apparently. \u2022 Quite separately, the anarchist collective newspaper Freedom goes wholly online and ceases newsprint publication after 128 years. Papers don't sell as before, the Freedom Collective says. This we know. \"As a result annual losses now amount to \u00a33,500.\" Dreadful. Those readers? Where did they both go? \u2022 Can't say, finally, whether Nigel Farage crossed the border with his one-time assistant (\"Did Ukip with your aide, Nige?\" asked the Sun). But we can testify to Ukipians' ability to effect change. Jonny and the Baptists were just \"two blokes doing jokes with a guitar\", according to frontman Jonny Donahoe, when \u2013 as we highlighted last week \u2013 Nige's deputy, Paul Nuttall, issued a statement condemning the band's Stop Ukip tour, and party supporters took to posting hate messages. The result: three new tour dates and 10,000 additional views for their video on YouTube. Way to go, Ukip. At this rate, Jonny's heading for Wembley. Twitter: @hugh_muir \u2022 This article was amended on 19 March 2014 to remove an item which said that a special adviser at the Department for Communities and Local Government had \"fired off an ill-tempered letter\" to the Institute for Government after it had published a report on the abolition of the Audit Commission. We accept that no such letter was sent by any member of the department. It was further amended on 17 November 2014 to clarify that Martin Sewell worked at Cambridge University as a supervisor rather than a lecturer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
