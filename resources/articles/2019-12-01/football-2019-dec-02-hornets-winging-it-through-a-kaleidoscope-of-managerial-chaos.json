Get a grip, Granny! It\u2019s not a soap opera, it\u2019s Watford v Arsenal. It\u2019s real,\u201d we explained, while fumbling around for her Xanax. Just three months and one league win later, Flores has again been axed from the show \u2013 because that\u2019s what Watford have become. Forget, Arsenal, Spurs and Manchester United \u2013 for ridiculous soap opera-standard drama you want to get yourself down to Vicarage Road. The club have sacked more managers than they have won league games this season, with the Pozzo family going the full Palermo in its approach to running the club. \u201cThe appointment of a new head coach is imminent and with nearly two thirds of the season remaining, we will provide all the support necessary to make the coming months successful,\u201d parped a Watford statement after Saturday\u2019s 2-1 defeat at Southampton. On Monday, they revealed an announcement is not that imminent after all, because academy manager Hayden Mullins will take charge for the inevitable defeat at Leicester. The Fiver can\u2019t wait to see which manager pops up next. If recent history is anything to go by, Javi Gracia would be the obvious choice, given that he probably still has a valid security pass. A return for Dave Bassett could come with a deal for an Amazon documentary attached, Gianfranco Zola would be good for ratings, while the second coming of Magic Marco Silva at Christmas would be pure pantomime, if only Everton would sack him already. Sadly, the leading names being linked with the club appear to be sensible options: Chris Hughton and Sam Allardyce, two men with seasoned survival tactics so tediously effective that Watford could be in danger of stumbling upon stability if they kept hold of either of them. Even the wildcard choice, former Betis boss Quique Seti\u00e9n, is known for bringing consistency and identity to his teams. Could it be that the Pozzos have realised that winging it through a kaleidoscope of managerial chaos might not be the best way to secure mid-table mediocrity after all? With games against Liverpool, Manchester United and Sheffield United coming up, Watford need to choose their next manager wisely. Perhaps that\u2019s why the Pozzos are considering putting the brakes on their free-jazz approach to running the club. At least Allardyce or Hughton would be good for Granny Fiver\u2019s blood pressure. We\u2019re not sure she could handle another Hornet being resurrected on live TV.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI\u2019ve mentioned my taxi ride with [Brendan] before. He was with us here at beIN Sports after losing his job at Liverpool. I won\u2019t go into detail, but during the journey back to his hotel, he left me with absolutely no doubt that Arsenal\u2019s was the job he coveted\u201d \u2013 Richard Keys won\u2019t go into detail on Brendan Rodgers\u2019 Arsenal inspirations. RECOMMENDED LISTENING A piping-hot new edition of Football Weekly is over here. FIVER LETTERS \u201cAs the long-suffering editors of The Fiver will know, I occasionally send in a letter in keeping with the general tone of Fiver letters. Somewhat unfunny, overly pun-laden and tenuously linked to football. But I want to be serious for once. The continued pain of Liverpool people \u2013 not fans of one club \u2013 over Hillsborough is very distressing to me, a visitor and resident of that city for 10 years. Scousers opened their hearts to me, and I to them. Their friendship and welcoming city deserves far more than they have been given so far. Football unites people of all stripes, and so does the city of Liverpool. I stand with the families of the 96 in their pursuit of justice and peace for their lost loved ones. The game of football should unite, not divide\u201d \u2013 Andrew Tate. \u201cFirst it was Ars\u00e8ne at Arsenal, then Emery at the Emirates. Step up, poor beleaguered Ole Gunnar \u2026\u201d \u2013 Rod de Lisle. \u201cDelighted to see I\u2019m not alone in seeing a resemblance between Unai Emery and the manager of a certain high-class bureau de change. I posted this observation on Facebook a while ago \u2013 with pictures \u2013 and got three likes. Maybe we\u2019re as funny as each other. What a sobering thought\u201d \u2013 Nick Wiltsher. \u201cI unashamedly admit to laughing out loud when I read that you trademarked Humility Man\u2122. Oh my, I\u2019m laughing again. Mourinho\u2019s new nickname is appropriate and humorous on so many different levels. Thank you for making my day!\u201d \u2013 Elizabeth Frederiksen [the er, cheque\u2019s in the post, Liz]. \u201cI just won a game of Scrabble by playing the word FIVER.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Kick-offs in all of January\u2019s FA Cup third round games will be delayed by one minute to help promote mental health awareness, the FA has announced. Working in partnership with the Heads Up campaign and the NHS\u2019s Every Mind Matters, the initiative aims to get fans thinking about their mental wellbeing. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid fans may be punished with a partial stadium closure after they chanted \u201cGriezmann, die\u201d at their former striker on his return to the Wanda Metropolitano with Barcelona. Several objects were thrown on to the pitch, including a black umbrella. Dwight McNeil for England? Sean Dyche is firing up the bandwagon. \u201cWhen I see some of the other young players getting called up, he can\u2019t be that far away in my opinion,\u201d Dyche croaked. Sergio Ag\u00fcero will sit out the weekend\u2019s Manchester derby due to his ongoing thigh knack, according to Pep Guardiola, who has also defended his continued trust in Fernandinho as a centre-back. \u201cHave you seen him play?\u201d he pouted. After rather fudging the question on Sunday, Brendan Rodgers has clarified his commitment to Leicester. \u201cWhy would I want to leave at this time?\u201d he roared, to set fans of the Queen\u2019s Celtic scoffing. And finally a nod to Ajax\u2019s terrifying under-12s outfit, who showed no mercy to MVV Maastricht\u2019s youth side, winning Saturday\u2019s contest by 50 goals to one. STILL WANT MORE?
