Why?", "bodyText": "Despite a 75% drop in the number of children going through the courts in England and Wales since 2010, in many areas more children than ever are being accused of crimes, according to figures obtained by the Guardian. In Greater Manchester, for example, figures released to the Guardian under freedom of information (FOI) laws show that children aged 10 to 17 were suspected of 24,250 crimes from March 2018 to March 2019, compared with 14,429 in 2012-13 \u2013 an increase of 40%. During that time, the number of youths charged almost halved, going from 3,231 in 2012-13 to 1,742 in 2018-19, a drop of 46%. The difference is how they are now being dealt with. The Youth Justice Board says fewer children are being cautioned or convicted because there has been a big push towards out-of-court disposals such as restorative justice, which brings those harmed by crime or conflict and those responsible for the harm into communication. But in Greater Manchester at least, restorative justice is being used less than ever. In 2018-19, 2,650 offences were dealt with using restorative justice, compared with 4,490 in 2012-13. What appears to have changed is how well (or badly) police gather evidence. In 2018-19, more than half of all cases involving children (14,044) did not proceed because although a suspect was identified, there was either \u201cinsufficient\u201d evidence or \u201cevidential difficulties\u201d. In 2012-13, the figure was just 1,723. There has also been a big rise in detectives taking their time with cases and releasing children \u201cunder investigation\u201d for months or even years without charge. Release under investigation (RUI) expanded hugely after April 2017 when a law change (the Bail Act) meant police could only bail people for an initial period of 28 days. As a result of decreasing police resources \u2013 Greater Manchester police (GMP) have lost 2,000 officers and 1,000 staff since 2010 after having their budget cut by \u00a3125m \u2013 it has become increasingly difficult to complete many investigations within a 28-day period and so forces use RUI instead. The practice has been criticised by the Law Society, which says RUI leaves the accused and victims in limbo with no updates on their case for an unlimited time. There is also evidence that people are being released under investigation who could be a risk to victims of crime and the public in general, rather than being put on bail as would be more appropriate. This particularly affects victims, who may be targeted again by the same perpetrator. Figures collected by the Law Society under FOI revealed that GMP released 9,579 people and bailed 1,846 in 2017-18 . A year earlier the force arrested and bailed 12,370 people. Where children are concerned, GMP failed to decide what to do with 1,256 youth cases in 2018-19, labelling them \u201cdecision pending\u201d. These included one allegation of murder and 100 of rape. \u201cDecision pending means that a case has been referred to a juvenile diversion panel or to the CPS and we are awaiting their decision,\u201d GMP said. The force said the increase in youth crimes had resulted from changes to the way crime was reported. \u201cIn line with the Home Office crime recording standards, police services are recording crimes at incidents in 2018-19 which were not being recorded in the years 2012-13 and before,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThese additional crimes have contributed to the increase in cases of evidential difficulty. By their nature, in the incidents where the commission of a crime is less clear, it will be more difficult to prove that an individual has acted unlawfully, which has a higher evidential threshold.\u201d Charlie Taylor, the head of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, said he was \u201creally worried\u201d about the abuse of RUI, which could be \u201ccompletely unfair\u201d to both child suspects and victims. He said he had raised his concerns at a criminal justice board meeting this year attended by the justice secretary, the home secretary and the attorney general, telling them of a child accused of a sex offence who had been released under investigation for two years. As the investigation had dragged on without a conviction, the youth offending team had been unable to work with him and both the suspect and the complainant had been \u201cleft dangling for two years\u201d, he said. \u201cAs a result of that conversation, both Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Crown Prosecution Service inspectorate are doing an investigation into it,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cThere\u2019s a consensus when it comes to RUI that it\u2019s completely unfair. The police don\u2019t particularly like it and it is just not proving effective, particularly for children, and it really worries me.\u201d Olivia Pinkney, a chief constable and the national policing lead for children and young people, said RUI was bad for children. \u201cAnything that runs even a month, let alone a year, is profound. Not only will they have grown up significantly in that period, but it can actually have a really material impact on education. You know, you miss a whole year of school, GCSEs, all of that stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are real practical implications of release under investigation. The Law Society are right. Policing has always said that we absolutely acknowledge the problem that the changes to the Bail Act were supposed to solve, but that the solution wasn\u2019t the right one.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
