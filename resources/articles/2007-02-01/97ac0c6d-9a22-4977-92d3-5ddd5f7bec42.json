But, according to government sources, the industry is likely to be frustrated in its hopes that the rate of tax levied on internet gaming will be significantly lower than the level paid by bricks and mortar gambling operations. The Treasury has long harboured ambitions to get its hands on some of the revenues enjoyed by companies such as PartyGaming and 888 Holdings, which are based in offshore havens such as Gibraltar or Antigua. At the time of the pre-budget report last year the chancellor announced plans for a remote gaming duty but added that he would hold off setting a rate until the Treasury had studied the impact of the new Gambling Act. The act allows for online gaming operations based offshore to obtain a licence and move back to the UK from September. The tax rate they will pay will be announced in the budget on March 21. The gaming industry wants a nominal rate closer to 2% or 3% rather than the 15% tax on gross profits paid by bricks and mortar gaming businesses. The industry says it is operating on wafer-thin margins and a big tax burden could kill it. The online gaming industry was buffeted last year by a legislative clampdown on internet gaming in the lucrative American market. Companies such as PartyGaming and 888 Holdings withdrew from the US last October when the new law came into force. Last month London-listed Neteller, the market-leading \"virtual wallet\" payment processor, closed its American operations after the arrest of its two Canadian founders. The Treasury is believed to be open to offering a cut-price rate to lure back the gaming industry but it is likely to merely be a discount to the existing 15% rate rather than set at a knock-down level."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
