She hated her job, but had always been able to push through the Sunday night dread to turn up on time. Yet on this particular Monday morning, almost two years ago, King couldn\u2019t exit the roundabout. \u201cIt was like I was possessed, my body was telling me not to go to work,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead, I turned around and drove to my GP.\u201d King was burned out. Her job of 17 years at an international manufacturing company, where she managed their accounts, office and IT, was sapping the life out of her, largely due to a \u201cmicromanaging boss\u201d. \u201cI was very emotional, teary and agitated at work; I had a short fuse,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really hit home to me when someone said to me, \u2018You know, you\u2019re such a different person outside of work to who you are at work.\u2019\u201d King, who is based in Victoria, quit the role almost two years ago and now runs her own small business. But the effects lingered. \u201cEven three months after I quit, I found myself thinking, \u2018I hate Sundays\u2019, then I realised, \u2018No, I don\u2019t anymore.\u2019\u201d A 2018 report for the Centre for Future Work at the Australia Institute found that Australian workers are completing 312 hours of unpaid overtime per year, which adds up to two months per worker annually. Another 2018 survey by mental health technology company Medibio, dubbed Australia\u2019s Biggest Mental Health Check-In, found one-third of Australian employees in the corporate sector are affected by mental illness, with 31% of those people suffering from stress. \u201cThe majority of people in corporate Australia are living that dash-for-cash philosophy, and we are no longer working a standard week and having weekends off to enjoy downtime,\u201d says Stuart Taylor, workplace expert and founder of corporate resilience training company Springfox. \u201cThere is a sense of always being \u2018on\u2019 even when you\u2019re not actually at work.\u201d An unrelenting workload was also familiar to Australia\u2019s colonial antecedents. In 1856, Melbourne stonemasons marched to Parliament House to demand an eight-hour day, marking the beginning of a series of progressive labour laws that enshrined workers\u2019 rights to clock off at a reasonable time. While these protections have been preserved to varying degrees in contemporary workplace agreements, many employees are nevertheless working 19th-century hours at the expense of their mental and physical wellbeing. \u201cThese days, the people who get paid the most are those who are working the most hours,\u201d says Michael Leiter, a professor of industrial and organisational psychology at Victoria\u2019s Deakin University. \u201cIt used to be those who worked the most hours were low-paid people trying to make a living.\u201d In a sign of growing concern over the increased incidence of workplace burnout, the World Health Organisation recently added burnout to a list of occupational phenomenons, although it stopped short of labelling it a disease. WHO defines burnout as being characterised by exhaustion, cynicism or detachment from one\u2019s job, and reduced professional efficacy at work. This chimes with King, who used to love her job and got on well with her previous manager. \u201cBut the new manager made me feel so devalued and like my opinion didn\u2019t matter, even though I had seen the company grow over many years,\u201d she says. Leiter has been studying burnout since the 1980s, and says the global nature of the business world has chipped away at Australia\u2019s standard working hours. While burnout is \u201cmore intense\u201d in the US, owing to precarious healthcare and higher levels of student debt, Australians are suffering too, he says. \u201cThere are definitely some people in Australia who are working their allotted hours and then they go home,\u201d Leiter says. \u201cHowever I think there is a significant slice in Australia, on the low and high wage-end of the scale, who are working ridiculous hours.\u201d As Leiter, points out, burnout seems to affect those earning at the extreme ends of the spectrum: commercial lawyers working 100 hours a week as well as underemployed gig economy workers who struggle to earn a minimum wage ferrying delivery food to the same corporate lawyers too busy to cook. \u201cThe gig economy is totally hostile to a unionised framework, and then at the higher end of the pay scale if you want to compete globally, you have to scramble all the time,\u201d Leiter says. Which speaks to one of the common features of burnout: an overwhelming sense that your work life, your career, is out of your control. A recent study by researchers from Montreal University tracking 2,026 people \u2013 half of whom were women \u2013 for four years, found that women were more likely to burn out because they had less authority or control over their work than men. \u201cWhether someone has input into important decisions that affect their work is a major factor [in burnout],\u201d Leiter says. \u201cPeople have a real need for that autonomy. And by autonomy I don\u2019t mean, \u2018I can do whatever I like\u2019, it\u2019s about that feeling of making something happen as opposed to being acted upon.\u201d This was certainly the case for King, who felt worn down by a lack of agency. \u201cWhen my manager wanted something done, he wanted it done straight away,\u201d she says, \u201cIf I wanted to put in a new procedure, he wouldn\u2019t allow it and always wanted it his way even if it wasn\u2019t the best.\u201d Taylor has worked with scores of corporates to help build resilience in stressful situations and says both men and women, senior or junior, can feel they lack control. \u201cI know a lot of high-ranking executives who say they feel they have no control over what the board is doing,\u201d Taylor says. If your workplace is not allowing workers any freedom whatsoever, then maybe it\u2019s time to look for another job, Taylor suggests. \u201cIt may not be easy and it may take a while, but starting the process of looking is part of taking some control back,\u201d he says. How invested employees feel in their work can also be the difference between exhilaration and exhaustion. \u201cWithin reason, doing work that really matters does not burn people out as quickly and, in fact, it often energises them,\u201d Leiter says. And the problem, according to Leiter, is that many people are pulled away from work they enjoy to perform soul-crushing administrative tasks. \u201cTechnology gets a bad rap, but the problem with technology is that it allows employers to impose all kinds of administrative nonsense, such as compliance training, filling out forms, online time sheets,\u201d he says. \u201cThis meaningless work exhausts people, and it makes them more cynical.\u201d Leiter notes that millennials are more likely to feel the effects of burnout compared with other demographics, with a viral Buzzfeed article, \u201cHow millennials became the burnout generation\u201d, capturing the mental load many young Americans feel. It appears to be no different in Australia, with a stress and wellbeing survey conducted by the Australian Psychological Society finding those aged 18 to 25 consistently report lower levels of wellbeing. \u201cIt\u2019s a vulnerable time for burnout when you first start work as you\u2019ve usually come from university or some form of training, which is more idealistic,\u201d Leiter says. \u201cSo there is a conflict between the reality and the idealistic vision of work.\u201d The tech-heavy aspect of much of modern work is not helpful for millennials either, according to Leiter. \u201cWhile information technology opens access to resources that further a person\u2019s work, it also opens users to distractions and to administrative busy work that will hurt their productivity in the long run,\u201d he says. In King\u2019s view, far too many of us have merged our identities with what we do for a living. \u201cI honestly think a lot of people are lost and work is feeding people\u2019s self-worth,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter all, you don\u2019t have time to realise you\u2019re unhappy if you\u2019re working all the time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
