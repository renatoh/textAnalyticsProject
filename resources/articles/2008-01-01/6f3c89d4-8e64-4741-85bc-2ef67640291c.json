Yet there was often a humorous twinkle in his eyes, allied to a softly modulated voice that expressed itself with a clear and unforgiving intelligence. These qualities enabled him to make a unique contribution, both to the National Gallery of Scotland, first as an assistant on his arrival in Edinburgh in 1954, then as keeper in 1967, and ultimately to the wider body that includes the Scottish National Portrait Gallery and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. He was born in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, the son of Edward Thompson, who worked as a Treasury solicitor, and Jessie Cameron, a former Fife schoolteacher. After leaving Sedbergh school, in Cumbria, at 16, he travelled through France and Germany, acquiring linguistic skills that he would exercise at Bletchley Park during the second world war. He went on to King's College, Cambridge, but left for the services before completing his degree in modern languages, something he did after the war ended. There followed a brief period at Chelsea School of Art, where he was befriended by the painter Ceri Richards, who is likely to have been instrumental in his appointment to teach drawing and art history from 1948 to 1954 at the Bath Academy of Art, in Corsham. There, Thompson met a sculpture student, Jean O'Connell (always called Binkie) and they married in 1950. When he eventually became director of all three Edinburgh galleries in 1977, he was able to start experimenting with his ideas on how we perceive the works of the old masters and methods of display. But he always worked in collaboration with others, particularly the individual keepers. In 1980 he encouraged the present writer in the production of an exhibition, Eye to Eye, at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery which compared and contrasted works from all three collections in a way which some saw as violently disjunctive, but which made the casual visitor sit up and think about what pictures could do. It was the first gallery exhibition to have a designed setting and also the first to attract commercial sponsorship, a field that opened up rapidly in subsequent years. Thompson himself curated two exhibitions on similar themes, Seeing is Not Believing and Lookalike: Themes and Variations in Art, in a way in which it is difficult to imagine any national director doing today. At about the same time he wrote and introduced a programme in the BBC television Spectrum series, The Trouble About Old Masters. It was all a deeply considered populism, expressed in finely honed language. The writing of clear, short texts became an obsession and should have had a wider effect, but the importance of this kind of communication is still too often overlooked. Thompson was also instrumental in bringing the Scottish Photography Archive (now the Scottish National Photography Collection) into being in the context of the Portrait Gallery, and he gave me much sterling support when I launched the series of commissioned portraits of eminent contemporaries in 1982, based on the premise that they should be painted, not by conventional portrait painters, but by artists whose work was redolent of the times. He backed to the hilt my choice of Avigdor Arikha to paint the first subject in the series, the Queen Mother, when a number of eyebrows were raised. Thompson, in fact, did an enormous amount to open the National Galleries of Scotland up to the needs of the modern world, creating an initially combined education, information and publicity department and launching the campaign Yours to Enjoy. Ivory towers crumbled as he persuaded curatorial staff to engage far more with gallery visitors and the media. Journalists were commissioned to write for gallery news publications and a new design and publishing department was set up. He collaborated with many major scholars in these years, both in the making of exhibitions and in more conventional art historical publications - among the latter his joint book with Lorne Campbell on Hugo van der Goes's Trinity Altarpiece (1974) and a history of the National Gallery's collection, Pictures for Scotland (1972), written with myself and Hugh Brigstocke. Major exhibitions included The Discovery of Scotland, inaugurating the underground extension at the National Gallery of Scotland in 1978, which he had done so much to plan before he became director; Poussin: Sacraments and Bacchanals (1981); and, in 1979, what proved to be the National Galleries' first \"blockbuster\", Degas 1879, curated by Ronald Pickvance and promoted with the Edinburgh festival, whose director, John Drummond, became a good friend. As Thompson's tenure came to an end in 1984, he oversaw with Douglas Hall the transfer of the Gallery of Modern Art's collection to the former John Watson's school, whose reconfiguration as an art gallery they had planned together. This move was celebrated in a memorable exhibition, Creation: Modern Art and Nature. Colin had been a fine musician since childhood and had played in musical groups in Corsham, including a jazz quartet. In Edinburgh, he found himself living next door to a violin teacher, Wally Channon, and this led to his joining a quartet as viola player - Palestrina and Brahms were favourites. He is survived by Binkie, with whom he had a son and a daughter. \u00b7 Colin Edward Thompson, gallery administrator, born November 2 1919; died October 5 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
