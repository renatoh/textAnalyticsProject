They can cavil about their lack of preparation and the absence of Ramnaresh Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, they can carp about the wintry conditions and they can even reason that some of these tyros are being exposed too early to Test cricket but what cannot be excused is the poor attitude, which was slapdash to the point of carelessness. They were supposed to be trying to save the game and yet batted as if this was some benefit match. Runako Morton epitomised all that was wrong. He scored 25 from 62 balls, which may appear a doughty defensive effort but was really an erratic innings full of wild swishes at which even Zorro would have blanched. Liam Plunkett and Steve Harmison were still having problems with their radars and Morton could not resist a dart at everything they threw up outside off stump. England's captain Michael Vaughan was at his most inventive and some of his field placings to Morton typified his approach. Vaughan did not worry about his slips cordon as much as his deep square leg and even a wide short third man, who could easily have passed for a fly slip. Morton went hooking at Harmison, too late on a ball that spooned off the splice of the bat for the wicketkeeper Matt Prior to run up near the stumps and collect easily. It was hardly over-my-dead-body stuff. But Morton was not alone in his profligacy: Sylvester Joseph clumsily planted his front foot on off stump and, as a result, could get his bat nowhere an in-swinger from the excellent Ryan Sidebottom; Devon Smith went fishing outside off stump to the same bowler, pushing away from his body without any discernible feet movement; and Dwayne Bravo spoilt a promising innings by chancing his arm once too often against Monty Panesar. It all brought to mind the words of Sir Vivian Richards, who throughout the day was bemoaning the West Indies batsmen's unwillingness to leave the ball. \"You've got to do it in England,\" he said, \"In fact, in early season over here leaving the ball early on gave me more pleasure than it hitting the middle of the bat. You've got to show respect.\" Funny how Kevin Pietersen has also talked recently about practising his leaving. Great minds, great players and all that. Bravo's 52 at least contained some pleasing strokes, the best a well-balanced whip through midwicket off Sidebottom that brought an all-run four. He also struck Panesar for a sweet straight six but permanence was rarely hinted at. Chris Gayle can probably be absolved of censure, for the ball he edged from Plunkett was of immaculate line and length, moving just enough off the seam. Denesh Ramdin was unfortunate to be adjudged leg-before to Harmison - the ball was slipping down the leg-side - but he had joined in the impatient charge, being dropped at backward point by Plunkett from a wild flay. It was not the job of the tailender Jerome Taylor to alter the mood but his dismissal - a mis-hook off Harmison that dribbled depressingly onto the stumps - rather summed it all up. A mess."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
