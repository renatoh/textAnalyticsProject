In a game becoming increasingly standardised in terms of technique, tactics and physical fitness is it possible to retain that precious thing known throughout the world of rugby as \"French flair?\" \"Sure!\" France's head coach practically exploded with intensity. Then, with similar emphasis, he uttered a single name. \"Poitrenaud!\" Alas, poor Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud. The 19-year-old Stade Toulousain full-back was one of the discoveries of France's golden autumn, when in 15 days a squad based on young players put together a sequence of wins over South Africa, Australia and Fiji. On January 20, however, Poitrenaud broke his shoulder in a club match and will miss not only France's Six Nations opener against Italy in the Stade de France tomorrow but probably the rest of the tournament. Yet there is no question that he remains at the forefront of the coach's belief in the future. \"He's the symbol of that,\" Laporte continued. \"But, you know, French flair is no good for me. I don't like French flair. Look, Wilkinson is French, no? No. And he has French flair. So what is French flair? It's nothing, French flair. What are Catt, Wilkinson, Cullen, Umaga? Is that French flair?\" Fusillade of injuries Whatever French flair may or may not be, Poitrenaud certainly has it. \"He's the best, perhaps, in this young generation,\" Laporte continued. \"He's very quick and very collective, with very good timing when he comes into the line. And very rugby!\" Sadly, however \"rugby\" he may be, Poitrenaud will not be coming into the line for a while yet. But in his absence other members of the young generation will be given a chance to build on the impression they made in the autumn victories, and pre-eminent among them is another 19-year-old from Toulouse, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Michalak. \"Ah, class,\" Laporte said on hearing Michalak's name. \"Very flexible, very good in all the positions. Very rugby! Very, very, very rugby!\" That, one began to sense, is the coach's highest accolade. And Michalak, who made his debut at fly-half against Australia, will have a chance to shine in his regular club position tomorrow, when he takes over at scrum-half from the captain, the inspirational Fabien Galthi\u00e9, who damaged his right knee in Stade Fran\u00e7ais's match against Munster last weekend. The absence of Poitrenaud and Galthi\u00e9 will be lamented but they are merely the latest in a fusillade of injuries to have hit the French in the weeks leading up to the start of the tournament. Christophe Dominici has an injured shoulder and is out until April. The same month should see the return of Thomas Castaign\u00e8de, who is coming through the final stages of his recuperation from three operations to repair a damaged Achilles tendon. Abdelatif Benazzi is nursing a damaged knee. Patrick Tabacco, a line-out specialist whose performances at No8 against Australia and Fiji had been one of the major sources of satisfaction for Laporte, was forced by a thigh strain to withdraw from the squad. Taken in conjunction with other minor knocks, no wonder Laporte is scratching his head and asking questions about the fitness level of French players. \"I don't understand why we have so many injuries,\" he said, \"but it's certainly a big problem in France. For the two last tournaments we have a lot of injuries. I'm not a physiotherapist but I want to know why. So I'm having a meeting with all the physical training staff, so we can try to find the cause of these injuries. It deprives us of the continuity of working with the same team.\" Not even this, however, can quite dispel the glow of pleasure that persists from the achievements of the autumn, when Laporte and his assistants, Jacques Brunel and Bernard Vivies, brought 17 new players into the squad. With them came a new attitude, deemed highly necessary after the disaster of last year's Six Nations, in which France finished fifth. Shake up the squad \"Yes, we changed a lot of players,\" he said. \"We have new players and they have another mentality. After the last tournament we decided that we must change the thinking, and to do that we must bring in other players. Now it's a young squad and much more professional in the head. That's something new for the French, because we are Latin, and we have not been used to working a lot. But this generation is truly professional and does a lot of work. Rugby is more important in their lives. That, I think, is one of the reasons for the successes in November.\" Among the new stars is the 22-year-old Damien Traille, a 6ft 4in, 15st centre from Pau, first brought into the squad as a teenager during the era of Pierre Villepreux and Jean-Claude Skrela but now launched as one of the team's principal weapons. \"He can also play stand-off or full-back,\" Laporte said. \"Good mentality, very sympathetic, very professional, fits in well with the other players. At the moment perhaps he doesn't realise how good he can be at this level.\" Also in this week's squad are Fran\u00e7ois Gelez, a 22-year-old fly-half from Agen, understudying G\u00e9rald Merceron; Jean-Baptiste Poux, also 22, a prop from Narbonne; Aur\u00e9lien Rougerie, 21, a winger from Montferrand; Elvis Vermeulen, 22, a back-row forward, again from Montferrand; Thibault Privat, a 22-year-old prop from B\u00e9ziers; and Nicolas Jeanjean, a 20-year-old from Toulouse who has been favoured by Laporte ahead of the experienced Xavier Garbajosa as replacement for Poitrenaud tomorrow. The decision to shake up the squad was taken, inevitably, with one eye on the Six Nations and the other looking ahead to next year's World Cup. \"To prepare for that,\" Laporte said, \"we needed to introduce a lot of young players. It's marvellous because they're very attentive and very enthusiastic and they have the potential to play at a very high level. So it's exciting for me and for the technical staff to work with them. These young players create a lot of competition within the squad, which helps us to raise our level. And it will be our job, when the more experienced players return, to blend them all together. I don't care if a player is young or not so young. We just want to make the best team.\" To that end he has had no compunction in exploiting the rules of residential qualification in order to add two more \"foreigners\", the B\u00e9ziers lock Steven Hall and the Montferrand centre Tony Marsh, born in South Africa and New Zealand respectively, to the South African-born prop Pieter de Villiers. The name of Hall, who will be winning his first cap tomorrow in place of Tabacco, came to Laporte late one night last week, \"after two glasses of Manzana [an orange liqueur] and a sleepless night\". As ever the spectre lurking behind France's dreams of conquest is a notorious lack of consistency. They are a team accustomed to following great deeds with ignoble failures, so it came as something of a relief when, following the 20-10 victory over the Springboks in Paris and the 14-13 defeat of the Wallabies in Marseille, they were able to register a 77-10 win over Fiji in St Etienne. \"Consistency is our biggest problem,\" Laporte said. \"We are at a high level, and then sometimes lower. We must work on this. That is professional.\" At 36 years old the former B\u00e8gles-Bordeaux and France B scrum-half is in his third season as s\u00e9lectionneur . The intensity that struck observers of his early efforts has not waned and his opinions are still given in a staccato rattle but nowadays the hint of a smile can more frequently be detected behind the rimless glasses. England, he said, are \"for sure\" the favourites for the championship, with Ireland close behind. \"After that come Scotland, Wales, France and Italy, all at the same level - perhaps Italy a little less strong. But we must be humble. We finished fifth. We must finish at the top. Is it possible? If it were impossible, we'd stay at home.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
