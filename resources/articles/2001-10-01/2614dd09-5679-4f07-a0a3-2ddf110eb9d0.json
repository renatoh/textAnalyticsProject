The seventh victim was an employee of The New York Post, a tabloid newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, who tested positive for skin anthrax. Federal investigators are trying to track anthrax-laden letters back to their point of origin after a New Jersey postal carrier who may have handled the envelopes yesterday became the sixth person to contract the disease. Claire Fletcher, a CBS News employee and a British native, was also confirmed to have contracted the disease. Ms Fletcher works as an assistant to CBS news anchor Dan Rather, and her case meant that all three major US television networks had been targeted with anthrax. The US president, George Bush, said officials had found no direct link between the anthrax cases and foreign interests such as al-Qaida or Iraq. Speaking today at an economic summit in Shanghai, China, Mr Bush did not rule out the possibility that the anthrax attacks are acts of domestic terrorism, and vowed to prosecute those who carry out anthrax hoaxes. \"Anybody who would mail anthrax letters to try to affect the lives of innocent people is evil,\" Mr Bush said, thumping the lectern at a news conference. \"Our nation will do what it takes to bring them to justice.\" Anthrax-laced letters have been sent to NBC anchor Tom Brokaw and to senator Tom Daschle. An assistant to Mr Brokaw and the infant son of a producer at ABC News tested positive for anthrax infection. In Florida, the inhaled form of anthrax killed a photo editor at a tabloid publisher and infected his co-worker. More than 30 people - mostly Mr Daschle's aides in Washington - also have tested positive for exposure to anthrax spores. The Washington Post reported today that FBI agents were tracing the mail route of the letter carrier in New Jersey, who had contracted the skin form of anthrax, suggesting the letters may have come from her route. The mail to Mr Daschle and Mr Brokaw both were postmarked at the New Jersey mail facility. The Post also reported that a worker at a Washington postal facility that delivers mail to Congress had tested positive for anthrax exposure, the first case off the grounds of the Capitol that appeared associated with the letter to Mr Daschle, officials said. Investigators have said the anthrax-spiked letters have contained threats. One law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the letters sent to Mr Brokaw and Mr Daschle both contained the messages: \"Death to America. Death to Israel. Allah is great.\" Government officials have said, however, that it remains unclear how the messages relate to the motives of the culprits."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
