The profit alert came as the brand distances itself from its founder and former chief executive Ray Kelvin, who stepped down in March following allegations he had acted inappropriately towards staff, subjecting them to \u201cforced hugs\u201d and ear kissing. Lindsay Page, the company\u2019s longstanding finance chief who was promoted to the top job in April, admitted being \u201coff our game\u201d with some its spring clothing but said the weather and price cuts by rivals had proved bigger problems: \u201cSome brands launched their spring/summer collections in February at a discount. We are not immune to that. We have to balance the integrity of the brand with the wider market volatility.\u201d Ted Baker now expects underlying pretax profits to come in between \u00a350m and \u00a360m for the year to January 2020. Analysts had initially expected profits of about \u00a370m. The retailer had previously warned on profits in February. The update came as rival fashion chain Quiz also blamed the high street downturn for wiping out annual profits. The struggling Scottish chain, which issued three profit warnings in the last six months of the year to 31 March, made a pretax profit of just \u00a3200,000 on sales of \u00a3131m, down from \u00a38.5m a year ago. The Quiz chief executive, Tarak Ramzan, said its stores were struggling as fewer shoppers were visiting the high street while a high volume of returns had weighed on the success of its website. \u201cWe were chasing the Instagram customer too much,\u201d Ramzan said. Quiz floated on the stock exchange at 161p a share in July 2017 but its troubles have triggered a share price collapse. Tuesday\u2019s update sent them down again, by a fifth, to 21.9p. As part of a turnaround plan Quiz is closing 20 of its 174 department concessions and says it will also look to close or cut the rents on some of its 73 UK stores. The Ted Baker profit warning sent its shares down 29% to 954p. The company has halved in value this year but Page insisted that even if Kelvin, who founded Ted Baker in Glasgow in 1987, were still in charge it would be the \u201csame conversation\u201d. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that 79,000 retail jobs were lost in the first quarter of 2019, compared with the previous quarter, as chains close stores against a backdrop of rising costs and a shift to online shopping. \u201cIt has been a turbulent year, with many well-known brands disappearing from our high streets, as has been evidenced by the substantial loss in retail jobs this quarter,\u201d said Kyle Monk, the head of retail insight at the British Retail Consortium. \u201cPolitical and economic uncertainty has compounded many of the challenges created by the pace of technological change.\u201d John Stevenson, an analyst at stockbroker Peel Hunt, said the scale of the profit warning at Ted Baker would \u201craise eyebrows\u201d. He said: \u201cWhile these issues have been brewing for some time \u2013 and the ranges were designed well over 12 months ago \u2013 there will be questions around founder Ray Kelvin\u2019s departure and the wider question of how to get Ted back on point.\u201d Ted Baker has embarked on a major efficiency drive and has also launched a number of product initiatives, including introducing more fast fashion. It also plans to bolster its design teams with new hires. The profit warning coincided with Ted Baker\u2019s spartanly attended annual shareholder meeting, where the board received little scrutiny over the Kelvin affair. The Ted Baker chairman, David Bernstein, told shareholders the founder, who remains the company\u2019s biggest shareholder with a 35% stake, was no longer involved in running the company. Ted Baker did not publish the findings of an investigation into Kelvin\u2019s conduct but Bernstein said it had strengthened its HR procedures which were \u201cnot strong enough\u201d, including recruiting the former B&amp;Q HR boss Helena Feltham to the board. \u201cThere is definitely no crisis,\u201d said Bernstein. \u201cThe company is strong and the brand is strong. Any business in difficult times has to focus on the basics and we will continue with the cost-savings. I\u2019m very confident in the essence of the brand and that we will pull out of this \u2013 and hopefully quickly.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
