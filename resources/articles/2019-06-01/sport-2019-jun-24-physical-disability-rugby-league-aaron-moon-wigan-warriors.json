The 32-year-old is one of the star players for Wigan Warriors\u2019 PDRL team, fulfilling a lifelong dream by representing his hometown club at rugby league. Moon\u2019s journey has taken him to the Royal Marines, on tour in Afghanistan, through life-changing injuries, and even a career as a professional golfer. \u201cI joined the marines in 2006 and was deployed to Afghanistan in 2009,\u201d Moon says. \u201cWe were on a routine patrol and the vehicle went down a ditch where there was an IED [improvised explosive device] planted.\u201d Moon nonchalantly reveals the scale of what happened next. \u201cSmashed right heel bone, broken bones in my right leg, dislocated both knees, broken left femur, broken hip, dislocated pelvis, broken back and a ruptured spleen.\u201d A painstaking year of rehab followed, before Moon made a decision that would change his life for ever. \u201cThey kept trying to fix my right leg up but couldn\u2019t \u2013 so they gave me the chance to either spend my life in a wheelchair and on crutches, or have the leg cut off. It was a no-brainer; just get it off and let me get on with my life. \u201cI had it done and got a medical discharge from the marines. It was almost like a relief. I was surrounded by double and triple amputees and they were running and things like that \u2013 they were just further advanced than I was. They were a lot better off, and as soon as they gave me the option I said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it\u2019, and there was no looking back.\u201d Moon left the marines to become a personal trainer, helping those, like himself, with disabilities. But having played rugby before his injuries, the opportunity to play competitive sport remained unfulfilled until he embarked on another change of career. \u201cI started playing golf because I couldn\u2019t do rugby, and became a PGA-registered professional in 2015. I did three years as a pro, and it was very interesting. I worked at Bolton golf club, coaching while playing in local PGA events. But in 2018 everything changed again.\u201d That was the year rugby league launched a competition for players with physical disabilities \u2013 and it immediately caught Moon\u2019s attention. \u201cI played league as a kid, and I managed to get a summer at Leigh Centurions before I broke my collarbone. The PGA were great with me, but after seeing the adverts for Wigan\u2019s PDRL team \u2026 to find out I could play full-contact rugby again was incredible. Golf was great but it just didn\u2019t scratch that itch properly.\u201d Moon walked away from life as a golfer to become one of the first PDRL players, returning to work as a personal trainer for a day job. \u201cThe concept is amazing,\u201d he says. Moon is a frustrated spectator at present because of injury, but he will be at Wigan next weekend when they honour those who have risked their lives as he did, in their annual Armed Forces Day celebrations. \u201cI\u2019ve been across the world, I\u2019ve played at Twickenham in front of 70,000 people before \u2026 but coming here with the Wigan badge on your chest is far scarier,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cGet down to a training session if you\u2019re eligible to play, and if you\u2019re not disabled, get down and watch. The standard is ridiculous. PDRL is only going to get bigger and it\u2019s an honour to be part of.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
