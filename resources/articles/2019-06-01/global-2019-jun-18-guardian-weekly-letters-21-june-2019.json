Andy Beckett\u2019s What the hell happened to conservatism (7 June) should have mentioned two key problems. For one, conservatism needs to be seen as something in between rightwing populism on the one hand and neoliberalism on the other. The second is that Beckett focuses on UK and US conservatism. However, there is conservatism in continental Europe as well. UK and US conservatism might be called free-market conservatism, while continental European conservatism might be called strong-state conservatism. This explains, at least partially, why Margaret Thatcher \u2013 a free-market conservative \u2013 and Germany\u2019s Helmut Kohl \u2013 a strong-state conservative \u2013 never liked each other. They came from two very different ideological orientations. Thomas Klikauer Sydney, Australia \u2022 While Britain\u2019s Conservative party may be on the slide, the generic form of the word seems to be selling like hotcakes worldwide. The world\u2019s most powerful nations are increasingly and unabashedly trading on the classic autocrats\u2019 recipe appealing to fear, avarice and resentment. Here in Australia, the recently re-elected conservative government, the \u201cLiberal party\u201d has been ramping up its resistance to climate crisis action and UN humanitarian rules while continually invoking \u201cnational security\u201d as the pretext for ignoring its transparency obligations. In democracies, the traditional conservative claim to be protecting national values has largely withered to become standard xenophobia, as its proponents scrape for some justification of its waxing monopolies of wealth and power. John Hayward Weegena, Tasmania, Australia Tiananmen Square needs to be put into context The revisiting of the terrible events in Tiananmen Square needs to be placed in the context of the long history of violence associated with the struggles over democracy and the rise of capitalism (7 June). Starting with the struggles associated with the rise of Athenian democracy, key turning points include the English civil war, the US civil war, the battle for women\u2019s emancipation and the struggles over slavery, race and democracy, particularly in the US and South Africa. Countless thousands have been killed, injured, imprisoned and tortured over this long-term struggle. The 1989 events in China are not unique, nor are they exclusively associated with a distorted version of communism. They should be condemned, but they need also to be understood in the context of the ongoing struggle for democracy. Stewart Sweeney Adelaide, South Australia Militarisation of space is the ultimate goal In 1969 I was at MIT happily watching a movie when it was rudely interrupted by the foolish US moon landing. I don\u2019t believe for a moment that the main goal of a new US moon landing will be to find rocks to solve geological mysteries about what happened 4bn years ago (Moon shot, 31 May). US governments are willing to spend trillions of dollars chiefly for wars or to maintain their military bases throughout the world. With coincidental planned lunar action also by Russia, China and India, I think we are observing the militarisation of space. Douglas Porteous Victoria, British Columbia, Canada Want to vote? Become a citizen where you live Monique Gallwey (Letters, 7 June) complains that, as an Irish citizen resident in France for the last 20 years, she has no vote in national elections in Ireland or France. The remedy lies probably in her own hands: become a citizen of the country of residence, as I did 20 years ago; since then I have enjoyed full voting rights here. Derek Murphy Bad Pyrmont, Germany The fields of Eton have a great deal to answer for Theresa May\u2019s departure inspires a flock of Tory hopefuls, but Boris Johnson remains the favourite to succeed May as prime minister (14 June). If Boris is the best the playing fields of Eton can produce in this particular hour of need, they have a lot to answer for. Lawrie Bradly Surrey Hills, Victoria, Australia"}, "isHosted": false}}}
