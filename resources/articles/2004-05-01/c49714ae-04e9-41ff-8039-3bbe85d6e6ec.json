His name did not appear among the declarations yesterday for the Irish 2,000 Guineas at the Curragh tomorrow afternoon, much to the surprise of punters and bookmakers alike. O'Brien stated that One Cool Cat had been found to be suffering from a \"low-grade infection\" after a routine scope. One Cool Cat was the hot favourite for the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket earlier this month, a position he had occupied for many months. However, he did not travel well at any stage in the race and finished 13th of the 14 runners, after which he was found to be suffering from an irregular heartbeat. Punters had not lost faith in the colt, though, and he had been a top-priced 5-2 chance for tomorrow's Classic. The sudden withdrawal of One Cool Cat yesterday will do nothing to lighten the mood at Ballydoyle, where the 2004 season has opened with a series of setbacks. This latest reverse comes less than a week after O'Brien's Antonius Pius threw away certain victory in the French 2,000 Guineas by jinking violently right in the shadow of the post, and barely two weeks before Yeats, Bally doyle's other great hope for the year, is due to travel to Epsom for the Derby. In the absence of One Cool Cat, Jamie Spencer, whose brief tenure as Ballydoyle's stable jockey has yet to secure a major prize, will ride the 8-1 chance Grand Reward, while O'Brien will also saddle Newton. The eight-runner field is headed by Azamour and Grey Swallow, who finished third and fourth respectively behind Haafhd in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket. Leitrim House and Bachelor Duke are the British-trained hopes. The next obvious target for One Cool Cat is the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. Should he fail to make it to post for that race, though, the cynics may start to wonder whether his absence from the track is as much to do with protecting his considerable stud value as anything else. Yeats remains a solid favourite for the Derby on June 5, but the most significant mover in the ante-post market yesterday was another Irish-trained entry, Cairdeas. Dermot Weld's colt was a 33-1 chance with both Coral and Ladbrokes yesterday morning, but is now 14-1 with the former and two points longer with the latter after sustained support. Cairdeas, who has run only twice and was an easy four-lengths winner of a maiden at Naas 15 days ago, is due to run next in the Group Three Gallinule Stakes at the Curragh on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
