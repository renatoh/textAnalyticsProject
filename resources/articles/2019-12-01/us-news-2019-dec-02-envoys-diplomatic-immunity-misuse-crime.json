As soon as the cuffs come out, the villain flashes his embassy ID and utters two words: \u201cDiplomatic immunity.\u201d Realizing their suspect can\u2019t be arrested, the cops can only grimace. Justice is mocked and the diplomat walks. This familiar scenario has been a Hollywood staple for decades. IMDb lists 50 titles on its Most Popular Diplomatic Immunity Movie and TV Shows page, from Lethal Weapon 2 (1989) to NCIS: New Orleans (2018). Recent headlines, though, are a stark reminder that diplomatic immunity is more than just a hack plot device: A Teen\u2019s Death Has Put Diplomatic Immunity Under a Spotlight (Time), British Fury as an American Cites Diplomatic Immunity (the Economist). Don\u2019t Abuse Diplomatic Immunity (Toledo Blade). That\u2019s how the media covered the story of Harry Dunn, a British teenager who died in August after his motorcycle was struck by a Volvo SUV traveling on the wrong side of the road in Northamptonshire, England. The driver, Anne Sacoolas, claimed diplomatic immunity and fled the UK on a private jet. The UK foreign secretary later admitted in the House of Commons that local police had no authority to detain Sacoolas. Public outrage and op-ed vitriol ensued. As the wife of a US intelligence agent who was working in Northamptonshire at the time of the accident, Sacoolas was immune to prosecution. As stated in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, foreign envoys like Jonathan Sacoolas \u201cshall not be liable to any form of arrest and detention\u201d. The envoy\u2019s family members are also protected from all criminal and civil prosecution while they are in-country. Negotiations between American and British officials are ongoing. Dunn\u2019s parents want Sacoolas extradited to the UK to \u201cface justice\u201d. The US state department could waive Sacoolas\u2019 immunity, exposing her to legal jeopardy, but that\u2019s unlikely. Diplomatic immunity is rarely waived, especially by powerful countries that wield political clout. Not all diplomatic crimes become international scandals. In 2017, through an Access to Information Request, Canadian journalists uncovered over a year\u2019s worth of classified government reports that chronicle the exploits of foreign diplomats \u2013 and their family members \u2013 breaking the law with impunity in the Great White North. The transgressions range from minor offenses (speeding tickets) to major felonies (potential human trafficking in at least one diplomatic residence). In between are an array of alleged violations: assault causing bodily harm, robbery with a weapon, a diplomat\u2019s child accused of theft and assaulting an officer, an unnamed embassy that owed over $200,000 in back property taxes, and a diplomat who attempted to export two new vehicles without paying for them. No arrests were ever made. Having served at embassies in Warsaw, Poland and Juba, South Sudan, as well as the US missions to Somalia, former envoy Elizabeth Shackelford knows all about diplomatic immunity. She emphasizes that sensational crimes committed while stationed abroad are extremely rare. \u201cThe people hired at the state department are type-A personalities,\u201d she explains. \u201cCulturally, we\u2019re strait-laced people who follow rules \u2013 I never saw anybody abusing their privileges.\u201d She does admit that some countries have worse diplomatic reputations than others, but declines to name names. \u201cIt\u2019s a very small but particularly offensive segment of the community. It\u2019s unfortunate, but there are a few weirdos serving as diplomats.\u201d Pressed for details, Shackelford shares some embassy gossip that doesn\u2019t violate her non-disclosure agreement: \u201cYou do hear things, like somebody getting diplomatic passports for 50 of their family members and relatives so they can go to New York and behave badly. The Nigerians are notorious for that.\u201d Michael Bachner, a defense attorney who specializes in international crime cases, agrees that diplomat felonies aren\u2019t as common as screenwriters would have us believe. \u201cMost diplomats are good people who obey the laws,\u201d he says. \u201cThe occasional immunity crimes you hear about are outliers.\u201d But before hanging up, he drops the sober courtroom tone and offers some free legal advice: \u201cI\u2019m always cognizant when I\u2019m around diplomats. If I see a car on the highway with diplomatic plates, I give the driver a lot of room. Because there\u2019s a chance this guy could be a jerk and run me off the road, and nothing will happen to him.\u201d But why should diplomats have all the benefits? For a fee in the low to mid six-figures, anyone can purchase a diplomatic passport. The sellers are corrupt government officials in small island nations (Malta and Cyprus are popular) Asian countries (Thai prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra used a Cambodian diplomatic passport to register as a company director in Hong Kong) and African dictatorships (throw a dart at the map). Known as \u201cpaper citizenship\u201d and \u201ccitizenship by investment\u201d, these fancy letters of transit are as much a status symbol for high net worth individuals as a new Gulfstream or a palazzo on Lake Como. A consulting company specializing in securing foreign passports for the wealthy touts the privileges conferred by pay-to-play ambassadorship on its website. This includes diplomatic license plates, \u201cvisa-free travel\u201d and \u201csovereign inviolable status\u201d for homes. The thing that can seal the deal is diplomatic pouches. These locked containers, which range in size from a backpack to a shipping container, bear the official seal of a sovereign country; by law this property isn\u2019t subject to inspection or seizure at border crossings. \u201cYou certainly can purchase a diplomatic passport as long as you have the right access and the willingness to pay for it,\u201d says Fred Burton, the chief security officer at Stratfor and a former agent of the US state department. \u201cBut these transactions are an abusive and fraudulent use of government bureaucracy.\u201d Andrew Henderson, the founder of Nomad Capitalist, a company that peddles \u201coffshore tax and lifestyle strategies\u201d, embraces the contrarian opinion: \u201cPeople hate the rich. They find vulgarity in these individuals acquiring foreign citizenship. They think government employees and campaign contributors, who have no global perspective, should be the only ambassadors. That\u2019s nonsense.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 4 December 2019 to make it clear that diplomatic immunity is not necessarily enjoyed by a purchaser of a diplomatic passport."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
