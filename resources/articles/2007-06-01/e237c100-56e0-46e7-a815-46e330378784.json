Before one even enters the auditorium itself there's certainly a sense of more space everywhere. The clutter on the ground floor level has mostly gone, though curiously the unsatisfactory glass-box \"shop\", which was added not long before the hall closed for the redevelopment has been retained. But as soon as one hears any music, it's obvious that the major improvements are to be found there, unseen. The programme put together for the opening gala, had clearly been designed both to involve all four of the South Bank's resident orchestras, and to put the hall itself through its paces as much as possible in a single eveniing. The London Philharmonic and its music director Vladimir Jurowski took the first of the concert's three parts, and the Philharmonia under Christoph von Dohnanyi the last, while the central section was shared between the London Sinfonietta and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. Jurowski began the concert with the first of the two works especially commissioned for the occasion: Julian Anderson's Alleluia is a suitably imposing, choral setting of the 10th-century Alleluia Sequence, 10 verses each ending with an alleluia, which provided Anderson with a series of staging posts for the 15-minute piece, including an extraordinarily mobile, freely notated section for the chorus alone, which certainly tested the hall's ability to deal with complex textures. The second premiere was from Harrison Birtwistle, whose Cort\u00e8ge is a reworking, though in this context perhaps it should be described as a refurbishment, of a 1986 piece he wrote in memory of the London Sinfonietta's then artistic director. The new version makes the series of instrumental solos in turn more virtuosic and more outward-going, though the sense of a collective tribute persists. The OAE contributed the Symphony from the fourth act of Purcell's The Fairy Queen, while mainstream repertory was represented by Stravinsky's 1919 Suite from his ballet The Firebird, which Jurowski delivered with pinpoint panache, and the finale of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, in a performance of terrific drama and energy from Dohnanyi and the combined choruses of the Philharmonic and the LPO with soloists Joan Rodgers, Patricia Bardon, Simon O'Neill and Neal Davies, and which had been prefaced by Ligeti's wispy, refined Atmospheres. The nearest things to novelty items were conducted by Marin Alsop. Ives's Unanswered Question had the trumpet's questioning phrases sounding from around the hall, while a programmed encore of Ravel's Bolero, invovling musicians from all four orchestras was launched with a salvo of side drums sounding from the balconies. The huge forces worked up a ferocious sound level by the close, testing the hall's capacity just as the closing bars of the Ninth Symphony had done a few minutes earlier; both examinations seemed triumphantly passed. First impressions then, are good."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
