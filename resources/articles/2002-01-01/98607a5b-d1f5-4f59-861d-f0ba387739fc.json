Tottenham, Middlesbrough, Southampton and Bolton Wanderers are the four biggest names left out in the cold. Glenn Hoddle's Spurs side should have been at Coventry but the Highfield Road pitch failed an afternoon inspection, and Middlesbrough's game away to Wimbledon at Selhurst Park also fell foul of a week of sub-zero temperatures which left the pitch frozen solid. An icy surface at Millmoor accounted for Rotherham's tie against Southampton, rescheduled for January 16. \"It's disappointing for us and the fans, especially since we've had just the one game over Christmas,\" said Rotherham's manager Ronnie Moore. Southampton's captain Jason Dodd backed the decision to postpone. \"It is a shame because we wanted to carry on from where we left off at Stamford Bridge [Southampton won 4-2]. We are playing well and we're keen to keep it going. \"But I have seen the pictures of the pitch, and to be fair there did not look any way the game could go ahead. Much as we wanted to play it, you cannot take risks. I gather the pitch was rock hard and covered in ice, which is obviously dangerous.\" Bolton were saved the short trip to Stockport County and the ties at Brighton, Crewe, Darlington, Southend and Walsall were also postponed. Two games in the Second Division, at Brentford and Bury, and two in the Third, at Luton and Rochdale, have been called off and, in Scotland, seven of the 15 Tennents Scottish Cup third-round games succumbed, including the visits of the Premier League leaders Celtic to Alloa and Rangers to Berwick. The fourth-round draw, originally planned for Berwick, will now be held at Kilmarnock's Rugby Park , starting at about 5.10pm. It will be broadcast live on BBC Scotland and radio. The Rangers manager Alex McLeish said it was correct to make an early decision. \"The players' safety is of paramount importance, but equally important is that Rangers supporters travelling from afar need to know well in advance. We had to be sensible and make an early decision.\" Numerous matches in England and Scotland face pitch inspections today and, with the cold weather showing no sign of abating, several more games are in doubt, including Leicester's FA Cup home tie with Mansfield Town. Leicester have employed their all-weather pitch balloon in an attempt to ensure the fixture is played but, with the anticipated thaw failing to materialise, the referee Paul Durkin will take a look at the pitch in mid-morning. The Conference side Dagenham &amp; Redbridge have hired nine hot-air heaters in an attempt to stage their tie with Ipswich Town. The referee Rob Styles will inspect the pitch at 10.30am. Today's pitch inspections: 8.30 Colchester v Wrexham. 9.0 Grimsby v York, Margate v Farnborough, Northwich v Morecambe, Montrose v Brechin. 9.30 Southport v Leigh RMI, Stalybridge v Scarborough, Bath v Hinckley. 10.0 Leicester City v Mansfield, Altrincham v Emley, Forest Green v Hereford, Portsmouth v Leyton Orient, Shrewsbury v Oxford. 10.30 Dagenham &amp; Redbridge v Ipswich Town, Doncaster v Boston, Nuneaton v Stevenage, Woking v Yeovil, Wycombe v Fulham. 11.15 Hendon v Hampton &amp; Richmond."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
