The party\u2019s disability manifesto, published on Tuesday morning, proposes a range of measures across welfare, public services, transport, housing and jobs to enable disabled people to live independently, be treated with dignity and respect, and participate fully in society. The manifesto promises to sweep away a hostile environment of prejudice against disabled people it says was promoted by government to justify nine years of austerity cuts, and replace it with system that ends poverty and offers people security and dignity. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: \u201cThe treatment of disabled people by Conservative and Lib Dem governments, from devastating cuts to social security support, to cruel and unnecessary assessments, and a complete failure to address the disability employment gap, should be a source of shame. \u201cLabour will put right this injustice. We\u2019ll ensure that disabled people get the support they need to lead independent lives and participate fully in society. We are on your side. \u201cThis election is a chance for real change, for a more inclusive, fair and equal society that works for the many, not the few.\u201d The party promises to scrap universal credit \u201cin the medium-run\u201d and replace it with a new benefits system co-designed by disabled people. Labour says this cannot happen overnight, so it will introduce reforms to soften the process, such as ending the five-week wait for a first payment and removing punitive benefit sanctions. The Department for Work and Pensions \u2013 which the party says has \u201cbecome a symbol of fear for disabled people\u201d \u2013 will be overhauled as part of plans to transform the culture of social security. \u201cLabour will make us as proud of our social security system as we are of the NHS,\u201d the disability manifesto says. The much-criticised assessments for personal independence payments and employment and support allowance, both currently delivered by private contractors, will be scrapped and replaced with a more responsive system that engages with claimants\u2019 medical evidence. The manifesto adds: \u201cLabour will work with disabled people\u2019s organisations to develop a replacement to the current assessments based on a personalised, holistic assessment framework that provides each individual with a tailored plan, building on their strengths and addressing barriers.\u201d It promises to challenge the discrimination faced by disabled people in the workplace, and halve the disability employment gap, which currently means just 51% of disabled people of working age are in work, compared with 81% of non-disabled employees. Employers would be legally required to close pay gaps \u2013 currently disabled people are paid 12% less than non-disabled counterparts \u2013 and supported to retain disabled employees. A government-backed \u201creasonable adjustments passport\u201d scheme would be introduced to help disabled people move more easily between jobs. Labour\u2019s approach to change will be driven by disabled people, the manifesto says. \u201cUnder Labour, change will not be something that happens to disabled people \u2013 it will be something that is led and shaped by them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
