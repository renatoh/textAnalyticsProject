No Mancunians have drawn this often since LS Lowry was in his matchstick prime, and the Eastlands natives are getting decidedly restless, booing City off the pitch at the end of another disappointing performance and deflating result. Seven successive draws, some of them against modest opposition, is hardly the form of top-four wannabes, and it will be interesting to see how much longer the absentee sheikh remains steadfast behind Mark Hughes, whose excuses for his overpaid, underachieving team are wearing a bit thin. \"We are still in the mix at the top,\" he insisted last night, as supporters were ringing the phone-ins to discuss his future. Pressed on the subject, he admitted: \"There is pressure for me to get results \u2013 every manager has that.\" In mitigation, Hull were combative throughout, and are impressively transformed from the relegation ragbag who had a moribund look a month ago, since when they have won two and drawn two of their last four. With the advent of a new chairman, Adam Pearson, the embattled Phil Brown has turned things around in the nick of time, and it will not have escaped his attention that this latest restorative result came on the ground at which he experienced his managerial low point last season. It was in the corresponding fixture on Boxing Day that a dreadful first-half performance, which left Hull four goals in arrears, led Brown to admonish his players on the pitch at half-time. The result of his rant? A surly, resentful dressing room gave him two points from the next eight matches, and relegation was averted by a whisker. Fast-forward and, belatedly though it may be, they are playing for him now all right, and it was their indefatigable spirit that enabled Jimmy Bullard to celebrate his return to the starting line-up with a late penalty equaliser. City, as has become their wont, had the initiative throughout, but were frustratingly unable to translate the lion's share of possession and chances into goals. Individually and collectively, Emmanuel Adebayor, Robinho, Carlos Tevez, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Craig Bellamy et al should be doing better against bottom-half opposition. Defensively, too, Hughes has problems. One clean sheet in the past 10 league matches points up the fact that Micah Richards, Joleon Lescott and Wayne Bridge are all operating way below the level that brought them England recognition. Stephen Ireland, Tevez, Robinho and Wright-Phillips all threatened, to no avail, before City took the lead as the first half went into added time. Tevez set up Wright-Phillips, whose shot from 20 yards was deflected into his own net by Anthony Gardner's attempt at a headed clearance. Peskily persistent, Hull would have equalised straight after the interval but for Lescott's goalline clearance from Richard Garcia. The second half followed much the same pattern as the first, with Tevez, Wright-Phillips and Robinho all failing to summon the required accuracy in front of goal, and paying the price late on, when Lescott's foul on Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink enabled Bullard to secure a point from the spot with 10 minutes left. By way of celebration, he imitated Brown's rollicking last season. The Hull manager, in forgiving mood, smiled benignly, then said afterwards: \"I'm still in a job because of the sort of spirit the players showed here.\" Hughes's post-match comments induced a feeling of deja vu: \"We have the look of a team that has been put together quickly,\" he said. \"When you do that, you have to keep picking up points, which we are doing. I think the owner understands that.\" Famous last words? It is not about to get any easier, with Arsenal at home in the League Cup in midweek followed by Chelsea's visit next Saturday. THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT Robert O'Brien, Observer reader It was poor, disjointed, rubbish. Hughes has got to go. He inherited good players and made them worse. Richards was an England player. Now he wouldn't be out of place in the Dog and Duck team. We've got Champions League players and a mid-table manager. Guus Hiddink has got to be available \u2013 we've got to make a move for him. The owners are clever; proven players are not doing it for Hughes. He talks about a no-excuse culture but he's got no excuse \u2013 he's got to go. The fan's player ratings Given 6; Richards 5, Tour\u00e9 6, Lescott 5, Bridge 6; Ireland 5, De Jong 6; Wright-Phillips 6, Tevez 5, Robinho 6 (Bellamy 75 5); Rick Skelton, HullCityOnline.com It was pretty good and we were well worth the point. They had more of the game but they never looked like burying us and we were unlucky to concede. We made some changes in the second half that allowed Bullard to roam, and we got more and more confident. The team-talk celebration was superb \u2013 that's Bullard all over and Phil Brown's big enough to take it. Bullard has been the catalyst; we've stopped lumping it and now every second pass goes through him.
