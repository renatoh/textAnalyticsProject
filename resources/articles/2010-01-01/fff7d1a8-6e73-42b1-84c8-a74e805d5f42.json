We've been working around the clock, sleeping in the van between shifts. It's exhausting digging through the the rubble day after day but this is the sort of thing we constantly train for. This is what it's all about. Our team has done a lot of extractions of people trapped in buildings. You find someone and it's just a great feeling. When you start digging to get them out it can seem straightforward, but when you solve one problem, like clearing a piece of debris, you then find two other problems, and on it goes. You think it'll take 20 minutes but it takes five hours. It sounds weird but when a patient is released, and the pressure on their body is relieved, that's often when they pass out, or maybe even die. That's because if a muscle was constricted it burns up energy. Acid builds up and stays in that part of the body. Relieve the pressure and you release the toxins and that can damage the kidneys or heart. You've got to be ready to anticipate that. There was one guy we took out who lost both his legs. Everybody did what they were supposed to do and we flew him to a hospital ship but he still died. Not all our rescues have happy endings. There is tension between the American and French rescue teams, rivalry and political stuff. You could cut it with a knife. But it doesn't interfere with the job, we all get on with it. Right now we're backing up a French and Turkish team which is digging out a woman trapped on the top floor of a supermarket. We can talk to her and almost see her. She sounds young. We've prepared a litter to take her down. You can smell the corpses that are trapped inside here but at a moment like this you don't think of that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
