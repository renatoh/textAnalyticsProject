NOT IN MY NAME, TONY The Big Brother housemates voted George Galloway the cleverest of their number this week. Are you watching, Tony? So he was quietly furious when he learnt he was one of the first three inmates nominated for eviction. But Egregious George would be even more outraged if he discovered what Tony has been doing to the name of his party. \"It's a black word, it's a young word,\" George said when he launched the curiously named Unity Coalition. \"Like Aretha, all of us are just looking for a little respect.\" Now Tony is using it to fire up the kind of suburban solidarity that involves cleaning up graffiti rather than painting banners. And there's nothing he can do about it. Will Tony get his tanks off George's patch? Or will he sue? Incidentally, Labour supporters who received a heartfelt email about giving respect from Maureen O'Mara, a Greenwich councillor, this week, might be interested to know that Maureen is no political ingenue. \"Coming back from the station spray-painted words would follow me home and would be the first thing I noticed as I left my house in the morning,\" she wrote. \"In my local shop, at the bus stop, I would rage about the graffiti I saw. You might disagree with me; I know some say it's art but for me, I ask, why don't they scrawl over their own homes?\" According to her declaration of interests, Ms O'Mara is a \"self-employed political consultant\" who owns a company called Maureen O'Mara Ltd. What a useful sideline! A JOB TO ASPIRE TO Respect to ... er ... Hazel Blears, whose job title is listed as \"minister for respect\" in the government's Respect Action Plan. This might come as a shock to those who expected Hazel to have replaced John Hutton at the Cabinet Office by now. Still, a minister for respect certainly sounds like more of an enforcer than stuffy old chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. No wonder Hazel shows little sign of moving. RESPECT THE BACKBONE With so much other excitement at Westminster, the animal welfare bill has had regrettably little coverage in the press. Margaret Beckett introduced the bill yesterday, observing that only vertebrates would enjoy its protection, unless it could be proven that squid and octopi feel pain - in which case, the Backbencher assumes, their torturer would be duly prosecuted. James Gray (Conservative, Wiltshire North) made some shrewd observations. \"What the government is seeking to do is to kick many of these very difficult, very controversial, very awkward issues in detail into the long grass,\" said James, forgetting that the long grass might be a rather better home than, say, a mouse cage. Who, for example, could be sure who owned any given beast? \"A magpie which is caught in a magpie box, perfectly humane, would become in the ownership of the person who set the magpie box up. To what degree does that person have a duty of care in this bill to the magpie?\" he asked. Readers who can shed any light on this peculiar practice are invited to get in touch with the Backbencher. LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION Congratulations to last week's winner, Mark Faulkner. It was, of course, Charles Kennedy who spoke of \"emboldening\" his party under \"direct and aggressive\" leadership last week. The Backbencher just didn't realise that Charles was actually emboldening them to carry him to a quiet place and leave him there. \"It looks a fascinating prize, which is more than can be said for those awful books you normally have!\" writes one reader. You obviously haven't seen the stuff in the Backbencher's book box, Neil, but she may have to send you a thriller by Douglas Hurd anyway. THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION One of the most delightful discoveries the Backbencher made on a recent daytrip to Brussels was a shop devoted entirely to Euro-tat, and not just those vulgar \"Do It Like a European\" teatowels, either. Although she was disappointed not to find anything promoting the constitution - surely someone could have dressed a stuffed parrot in a \"Je dis oui\" sweatshirt - the final haul included a euro-symbol mug, a set of magnets and an eraser representing a five-euro note. If you'd like to get your hands on the latter, just tell the Backbencher how much teenage parents will be paid each week to attend parenting classes under the Respect Action Plan (and if you like, what percentage of the standard 16- or 17-year-olds' jobseekers' allowance that represents). Email backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk. terms and conditions are here. SHIRT SHRIFT No doubt someone, somewhere, is wearing one of the orange \"I'm a Minger\" T-shirts pictured here. But if you see one, please don't take a picture and send it in. The Backbencher is, however, keen to receive evidence that the following slogans are roaming in the wild: I Pick Opik I Want a Hughes One Oaten So Good (an allusion to a popular brand of porridge oats, or the \"Orange Breakfast\" set - a group of younger Lib Dem MPs keen to steer the party away from muesli and towards a warmer, more digestible liberalism ) Willis good enough for me There are more. The Backbencher is keeping a close eye on John Hemming, the Lib Dem MP for Birmingham Yardley, who is seeking backers for his assault on the Lib Dem leadership. Readers of the Guardian's Diary will already be familiar with John's qualifications for the job. \"Later today we had people approach us from, Ashfield and London WC1,\" he wrote yesterday.\"[note that this does not imply that the whole constituency supports my campaign].\" FROM MICHAEL WHITE AT WESTMINSTER \"The exciting bit of today's prime minister's questions - for the first time since David Cameron took over a month ago as Conservative leader - wasn't Cameron at all, who asked a couple of respectable questions about foreign affairs. No, it was about the Liberal Democrats. They've been in the spotlight for a whole week now, almost a record in my experience, and sure enough we all sat in the press gallery watching Sir Menzies Campbell nervously fingering his tie and sipping from a glass of water in the capacity as acting leader of the Lib Dems. \"And sure enough, when Charlie Kennedy a few weeks ago would have got up and asked his question (at about number five or number six), up got Sir Menzies, or Ming as he's known to everyone, ironical cheers, and he said: 'I wish you all a happy new year too.' And then, slightly to our surprise, [he] asked Tony Blair about over-centralisation of public services - there have been a number of critical reports in the last couple of days from the national audit office and the Labour-dominated health committee: why is the government making such a mess of public service reform? Well, Tony Blair, as you'd expect, pointed out the successes (better performing schools, shorter waiting lists, and all the rest of it). \"Sir Menzies got up and asked his second question, as he's entitled to do, but unfortunately had an accident. Why, in that case, he said, are one in five schools without a permanent headteacher? Great Labour roars of 'Neither do you have one!' and jeers and cries of 'More!' and awful things like that. Poor old Ming had to say, well, I knew it was going to be one of those days. Tony Blair was comparatively kind to him and said there was a problem with getting leaders, especially for failing organisations - more ironical cheers from the Labour party - and then said he was in favour of greater devolution of powers to local people and more choice and he hoped the Lib Dems would support it. \"We thought that was the end of it, but a few minutes later who should pop up but - yes - Simon Hughes, whom we expect to declare for the leadership. Mr Hughes bobbed up - more ironical cheers - and said, if the NHS is doing so well, why do people in Oxfordshire have to pay GBP10,000 to have private operations? Mr Blair congratulated him on whatever office he holds - he couldn't quite remember (actually Mr Hughes is the Lib Dem president) - and said that, every time we promote choice, which helps to improve the NHS, giving patients more choice between hosptials, you lot oppose it. Simon Hughes shook his head, and Mr Blair said, 'Oh really, a u-turn, eh? If he's going to start backing our reform policies, perhaps I'll back him instead of the other one'. He looked around for Mr Oaten, to do a bit of harm to all of them, because when he'd been kind to Sir Menzies a few minutes' earlier, Sir Menzies had drawn his hand across his own throat as if to say it was the last thing he needed. \"Mr Cameron was calm and asked highly respectable and responsible questions about Iran. Reminded me of the good old days when foreign policy was more or less seen as bipartisan in the Commons. He asked how Mr Blair was going to maximise support for the referral of the Iranian decision to the reopen the seals on its nuclear facilities and programmes to the UN security council and Mr Blair said, one step at a time, we won't talk about sanctions yet. \"Later on Mr Cameron was even more 'new model Conservative', if I can call it that: he started talking about the need to do more to reach UN and WHO targets in dealing with Aids in Africa. Mr Blair said we're doing jolly well, and we don't need any lectures from you, but we're glad that the Conservative party is at last taking an interest in this subject.\" * This is an edited version of Michael White's audio on PMQs today. FINAL READING Sir Menzies Campbell's performance at PMQs has given heart to his rivals, says Oliver King. Lib Dem PPC Justine McGuiness says the party needs a heavyweight candidate. Tony Blair's Respect action plan revives proposals to dock benefit payments to unruly tenants, even though they were rejected years ago, says Matt Weaver."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
