I was taking part myself for the sixth time. All photography during the hajj, particularly around the Kaaba (the black granite cube that is the holiest site in Islam), requires numerous Saudi permits, which are hard to get. So some of the time I relied on photography done by stealth. It is not unusual to see pilgrims on stretchers or in wheelchairs. During the tawaf - the ritual of circumnavigation of the Kaaba - I was taken around on a stretcher held above shoulder height, allowing me to shoot the pictures from an elevated position, while being out of view. On this occasion, I was up on an observation tower during the namaz, one of the prayers performed by Muslims every day. It is hard for me to remember much more about it; the hajj is so enthralling as a religious experience that the days blur into one and you lose track of time. Sometimes you forget to eat; I'd wake up in the morning and before I knew it, it was time for my evening meal. What I love about the picture, though, is how it shows the great variety of pilgrims, all united in one ritual. There were hundreds of thousands of people around - the numbers are quite overwhelming - so the image also goes some way towards showing the scale of the event. I think it perfectly captures the harmony and grace of the hajj.
