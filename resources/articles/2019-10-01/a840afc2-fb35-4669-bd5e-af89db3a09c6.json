In testimony to the House committees pursuing impeachment hearings on Donald Trump\u2019s conduct towards Ukraine, Michael McKinley said that foreign service officers had been left feeling unprotected in the face of improper political pressure. McKinley is the latest of a series of former diplomats to come forward to describe plummeting morale and growing politicisation in the state department \u2013 in particular because of Trump\u2019s conduct of a parallel policy based on narrow political objectives through the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. According to CNN, McKinley asked Pompeo several times to speak up for the ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who was withdrawn from her post prematurely in May, in part from pressure from Giuliani. She had refused to help his efforts to persuade Ukrainian officials to hand over compromising information about Trump\u2019s potential rival for the presidency in 2020, Joe Biden. McKinley is reported to have told the House committees he was appalled at Trump\u2019s dismissive references to Yovanovitch in a 25 July phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump called \u201cthe woman\u201d who was \u201cbad news\u201d and who would be \u201cgoing through some things\u201d. McKinley\u2019s appeals were \u201cgreeted with silence\u201d, CNN reported, prompting McKinley to resign last week. As a top adviser, McKinley was a fixture at Pompeo\u2019s side but the relationship between the two has soured dramatically. Pompeo did not even issue a statement thanking McKinley for his 37 years of service, as would have been customary for any departing veteran diplomat. Yovanovitch testified last week that Trump had forced her out of her job, and there was a concerted campaign to smear her. She speculated that Giuliani had attacked her because he was representing \u201cprivate interests\u201d in Ukraine. Two Soviet-born US businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who worked with Giuliani in his trawl for anti-Biden material, were arrested last week on charges of fraudulently funneling foreign money into the Trump campaign. Pompeo had boasted he would bring \u201cswagger\u201d back to the state department which had become demoralised under his predecessor, Rex Tillerson. But congressional testimony in recent days has painted a picture of disillusion and disarray. On Tuesday, George Kent, deputy assistant secretary in the bureau of European and Eurasian affairs, told the House committees he was sidelined on Ukraine policy and told to \u201clay low\u201d. Yovanovitch said that the state department had been \u201cattacked and hollowed out from within\u201d. Writing in the Foreign Affairs journal, William Burns, a former deputy secretary of state, wrote that in three and a half decades of service: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen an attack on diplomacy as damaging, to both the state department as an institution and our international influence, as the one now under way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
