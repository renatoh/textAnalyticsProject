Wilson started and impressed for his country during their 2-1 defeat of Denmark on Wednesday night. The Anfield club's assistant manager, Steve Clarke, was at Hampden Park for the game but the likelihood is that the former Rangers player will leave the Premier League club temporarily. \"I think I'll probably have to go out on loan, although I'm not sure where,\" the 19-year-old said. \"There are a lot of players at my club so it would probably be best for my career to go somewhere else just now. Kenny Dalglish [Liverpool's manager] has been really supportive of me. He knows that I want to go and play somewhere and he needs me to go and play too \u2013 it's no use to him having a young boy on the sidelines. I need to get more experience and he supports that. I didn't play a lot of first-team games last season and I don't want a repeat of that. \"I don't know where that [loan] will be. There have been no offers for me yet. Once they come in I'll evaluate them.\" Wilson moved to Liverpool in an initial \u00a32m deal from Rangers in July 2010 and has featured eight times for his new club, mainly in the Europa League. The centre-half said he has had no contact about moving back to Ibrox on loan. Craig Levein, the Scotland manager, may yet keep faith with Wilson for the European Championship qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Lithuania, but the teenager's situation before those matches next month will be key. \"I think it's highly unlikely that I'd be picked to play against the Czechs if I wasn't playing first-team football somewhere, but I'd have no qualms about taking them on,\" Wilson said. \"I completely understand that the national team needs people to be playing week in and week out. \"I was surprised to be in the squad for Denmark having not played regularly for Liverpool, but I was grateful to be included and to have been picked to play. Craig has obviously seen something in me to keep bringing me back, but I know I can't keep living off what I've done in the past. I need to go somewhere and start playing now and that's my objective.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
