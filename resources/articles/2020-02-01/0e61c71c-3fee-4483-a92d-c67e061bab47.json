Nobody expects them to emulate Leicester in steaming on to win next season\u2019s Premier League, but survival this year no longer seems out of the question and by one measure they are ahead of schedule. Back in 2014-15, Leicester began eating into a seven-point deficit with nine games to play; Daniel Farke\u2019s side are two matches better off and a campaign that had all but been explained away as a learning experience pulsates, at least for the next week or so, with fresh life. They deserved this win, only the second in their last 15 top-flight outings, against opponents whose deterioration in the final half-hour was a puzzle. Norwich\u2019s tails were already up when, 20 minutes from time, their indefatigable right-back Max Aarons stole a yard on Ben Chilwell and spotted his colleague on the opposite flank making ground rapidly. Aarons crossed perceptively, bypassing everyone in the middle and allowing Jamal Lewis to size things up on the far side of the box. Lewis controlled with his chest and then, with impeccable technique, cut across the ball to spear a raking low volley across Kasper Schmeichel and send Carrow Road into raptures. Such a daring combination between two young full-backs epitomises why Norwich, who never want for ambition, would be widely popular jailbreakers. They have squandered inviting positions all season but this time never looked like allowing an increasingly flat Leicester, who should have been ahead by half-time and will point to VAR\u2019s striking-off of a goal from Kelechi Iheanacho four minutes after the restart, a way back. \u201cIt was such a spirited and committed performance with a deserved win and a clean sheet; it\u2019s amazing,\u201d Farke said. He was particularly pleased for Lewis, an exceptional 22-year-old whose season had been stalled by injury and the form of Sam Byram. \u201cI\u2019m unbelievably delighted for Jamal because he had a tough first season in the Premier League. He had to adapt to the level and then was out for 10 or 11 weeks.\u201d His team had struggled towards the end of a watchable first half but Iheanacho, tasked with leading Leicester\u2019s attack after a calf injury kept Jamie Vardy away, missed their best opportunity when he turned onto Ayoze P\u00e9rez\u2019s cross before shooting over from seven yards. Dennis Praet also struck the outside of a post but none of that seemed to matter when Iheanacho found his bearings in spectacular fashion. He raced Ben Godfrey to a long pass and then, having foraged inside, curled unstoppably past Tim Krul. But it quickly became apparent that the ball had bounced off Godfrey\u2019s upper arm and struck Iheanacho\u2019s hand before he took aim; the VAR decision to disallow the goal, confirmed by the Stockley Park-based Graham Scott, was correct under the current numbingly austere application of the rules but Brendan Rodgers was perplexed. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the worst case scenario it\u2019s a free-kick for us. I think it\u2019s unintentional from the defender and then I don\u2019t know what Kelechi can do when it drops and hits his hand.\u201d He did not feel inclined to complain at length, though, even if his impression was that Leicester should not have lost. He acknowledged they had lacked the precision that has marked their past six months and admitted concern that 306 minutes have passed since their last goal. \u201cWe can\u2019t dance around the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to find that quality again.\u201d They might have been expected to show more of it after Iheanacho\u2019s disappointment, but instead Norwich seized their reprieve and fired two warning shots at Schmeichel via the outstanding Ondrej Duda before Lewis\u2019s coup de grace. Leicester would meet an unlikely target of their own by reaching the Champions League but there is still time for a teetering season to unravel; Norwich\u2019s possibilities are now open to a degree that set Farke\u2019s eyes ablaze. \u201cIt would be a little miracle,\u201d he said of the prize before him. \u201cBut we are here to create something special and if we go on further on with this belief, this unity and commitment, there\u2019s definitely a chance to do this.\u201d He only had to look at the team in blue, vanquished though they were, for all the evidence he needed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
