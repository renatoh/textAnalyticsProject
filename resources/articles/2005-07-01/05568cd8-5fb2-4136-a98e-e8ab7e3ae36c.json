In Spain, it costs from 30p to \u00a31.50 per minute to receive a call from the UK. In the USA, charges range from 65p to \u00a31.20. But for anyone who makes extensive calls when abroad, the answer is to not add to the UK companies' profits at all but to exploit the often overlooked fact that most phones can take a foreign Sim card. Mobiles are often programmed to only take one company's Sim, but they may provide a code which unlocks the phone for longstanding customers. Failing that, most independent phone shops will do it - perfectly legally - for a few pounds. Foreign Sims can be picked up on the internet. A Spanish one was on eBay for \u00a314.99 last week, including a \u20ac6 credit - and at www.spainsim.com/sims.htm, they go for \u20ac35. Once installed, the Sim enables you to receive calls for free and to ring the UK for between 30 and 50 cents a minute depending on the time of day, compared with 60p to \u00a31 for making such calls on UK Sims. The saving on calls within the country being visited are even bigger, being as cheap as 15 cents a minute on the Spanish card. There are commensurate savings for prodigious texters. In America, only triband phones (which most modern mobiles are) will work with either a UK or US Sim. T- mobile US Sims can be bought for around \u00a315. The only cost to receive calls is then the \"airtime\" charge (which American users pay for receiving all calls) of around 30 cents per minute. Calling the UK direct is just as expensive as on a British phone, but this can be avoided by using a cheaper service provider via a US landline. It is generally cheaper for the person calling you from the UK to do so to a foreign number, particularly an American one, than a UK mobile number. The disadvantage is that a substantial credit has to be bought to get the best rates, with some being wasted if the phone isn't used much. Only those who are given the new number will be able to get the traveller on it - but on holiday, cutting down calls may not be a bad thing. Sometimes better bargains can be had by purchasing Sim cards once you are in the country to which you're travelling. My wife and I bought two Australian cards for around \u00a320. Last summer, in France my Sim cost a rather hefty \u20ac49. In Malaysia, however, I picked up a local card for less than \u00a33 and it was sufficient for six days' use. In most developing countries, locally purchased cards will reflect the comparatively low cost of living."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
