The Brazil-born Deco is set to become Barcelona's fourth signing of the summer, following Juliano Belletti, Henrik Larsson and Ludovic Giuly. Giovanni Trapattoni, who was replaced as Italy's coach last month by Marcello Lippi, is to join Benfica, who have been without a coach since Jose Antonio Camacho left at the end of last season to take over at Real Madrid. Tottenham have made an approach to Bayern Munich regarding the availability of their England international midfielder Owen Hargreaves. However the \u20ac10m (\u00a37.05m) valuation the German club quoted has deterred Spurs, with Liverpool monitoring the situation. The Anfield club are keen to offload Dietmar Hamann with either Rub\u00e9n Baraja or Hargreaves earmarked as possible replacements. Newcastle United's manager Sir Bobby Robson flew back from Portugal last night and will meet his chairman Freddy Shepherd this morning amid further rumours that Barcelona's Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert is on his way to St James' Park. However, Robson's priority is a right-back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
