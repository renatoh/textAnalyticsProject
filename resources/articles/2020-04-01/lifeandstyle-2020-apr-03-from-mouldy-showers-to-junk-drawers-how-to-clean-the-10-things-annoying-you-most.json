Have you ever dusted your ceiling? Of course you haven\u2019t. But now is the time to do it, because you don\u2019t have anything better to do. Here are all the other jobs you were previously too busy to worry about, but which will provide a sense of achievement \u2013 or at least a little exercise. Clean your oven Easily the worst job in the house, but a gleaming oven will become one of your life\u2019s new pleasures. \u201cPrevention is better than cure,\u201d says Gemma Bray, the creator of the Organised Mum Method. \u201cI swear by oven liners, which will catch everything at the bottom of the oven. You take it out and quickly rinse it under the tap. But before you can start using an oven liner you have to start off with a clean oven.\u201d You can go for a heavy-duty oven cleaner, but many people are put off by the harsh chemicals these contain. \u201cOther people swear by using bicarbonate of soda in a paste, which I have never really had much success with, especially if you are battling a really grimy oven.\u201d Bray takes out racks and leaves them to soak in a bath of very hot, soapy water. \u201cWashing-up liquid is one of the best things for tackling grease. Slowly, little and often, work on the bottom of the oven \u2013 even in 15-minute slots.\u201d Wait until after you have used the oven, and it has cooled but is still warm. \u201cUse hot, soapy water and a cloth, and every time you use the oven go in there, go at it and eventually you\u2019ll start to see a difference.\u201d To clean a microwave, slice up a lemon and put it in a bowl of water. \u201cPut it in for five minutes at full power,\u201d says Lynsey Crombie, AKA the Queen of Clean and author of The Easy Life: Quick Ways to Clean and Manage Your Home All Year Round. Leave to cool for a while \u2013 you don\u2019t want a face full of scalding steam \u2013 then wipe with a cloth. Freshen your fridge \u201cTake everything out and put it in a cool bag,\u201d says Aggie MacKenzie, the TV cleaning expert who runs AggiesTips.com. \u201cHave a sink full of hot, soapy water ready and wash all the shelves. Wipe the inside of the fridge with water and a microfibre cloth \u2013 you don\u2019t really want to be introducing much in the way of products. The drip tray at the back can get clogged up, maybe with bits of labels from jars. Get a cotton bud, put some kitchen roll round it and dab in and out of the hole to keep it free-flowing.\u201d If you can manage, pull the fridge out and clean behind it. \u201cThat\u2019s when you discover you\u2019ve got mice, or you\u2019ve had mice \u2013 you\u2019ll see droppings,\u201d says MacKenzie. Gently dust or vacuum the condenser coils at the back of the fridge. Descale your loo An unsightly lavatory is bothersome, but easily forgotten after every flush. Tackle it once and for all. You need to remove some of the water first so as not to dilute the cleaning product too much, says Crombie. Scoop it out with rubber-gloved hands, or \u201cplunge\u201d it down the U-bend with a toilet brush. \u201cPut some limescale-removing product down there and leave overnight.\u201d Denture tablets or soda crystals will also work. But Crombie cautions: \u201cIf you put it down and someone uses the toilet within half an hour, you\u2019re not giving it an opportunity to work. The reason I don\u2019t advise bleach is it doesn\u2019t break limescale down. It will look better, but in a few days it will come back.\u201d Get a sparkling shower \u201cI use a 50/50 ratio of white vinegar and water solution in an old spray bottle,\u201d says Bray. \u201cIt helps to tackle the limescale and dirt. If you\u2019ve got a clogged-up showerhead \u2013 check first it won\u2019t damage the surface \u2013 you can sit it in a white-vinegar solution. I try to use as few chemicals as possible in the house.\u201d For the black mould spots around the silicone, \u201cget some tissue paper and soak it in a bleach solution\u201d. Your shower curtain can probably go in the washing machine \u2013 check the label \u2013 as can a non-slip bathmat. \u201cThey can go a bit gunky underneath, but they come out like new.\u201d Wonderful windows Shop-bought window cleaning products or vinegar will work on the glass. \u201cIf you have UPVC frames, use a cream cleaner or a damp sponge with bicarbonate of soda on,\u201d says Crombie. \u201cFor wooden, painted windows, dry dust them then clean with an orange-oil-based product, to protect the wood. Don\u2019t forget to clean the handle \u2013 just use what you\u2019ve been using on the frame.\u201d Vacuum your curtains, and wipe blinds. Tackle the junk drawer This is the time to be ruthless. Empty it out, says MacKenzie. Give the inside of the drawer a vacuum and a wipe with a damp cloth. Then \u201conly put back the things you use. If you think: \u2018I might need that one day,\u2019 no, you won\u2019t because you haven\u2019t used it in the last year. I used to have a dish full of keys and I never knew what they were for. One day I just threw them away. Did I come to any grief? No.\u201d Rehome items to the places they belong. Under the bed Remove whatever it is you are storing under your bed and clean off the dust (there will be a thick layer), then vacuum underneath. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to flip your mattress if it needs it,\u201d says Crombie. \u201cGive it a vacuum.\u201d If you have a steam cleaner, use this too. \u201cHold the steamer 30cm away from the mattress \u2013 people go too close and get the mattress wet and then they can\u2019t go to bed. Leave the window open so the mattress can dry. If you have stains on your mattress, a carpet-cleaning product should get them off.\u201d She recommends a homemade fabric freshener: 20 teaspoons of bicarbonate of soda and 20 drops of lavender essential oil in a 500ml bottle of water. \u201cJust spritz it on.\u201d Pillows can usually be washed \u2013 check the instructions. Walls, ceilings and doors Wallpaper, particularly if it hasraised patterns, can benefit from a vacuum. \u201cGently go over it with a brush attachment, or with a dry microfibre cloth or paintbrush,\u201d says Crombie. \u201cIf you have a flat-headed mop, use that to dry-dust your ceiling.\u201d While you are at it, use a brush (a clean paintbrush, or old makeup brush) to dust light fittings. Although some paint is washable, Crombie says she wouldn\u2019t recommend it, \u201cbut you can dry-dust\u201d. For marks, use a Magic Eraser or similar, or get a sponge and gently wipe. Don\u2019t forget doors, particularly those with dirt-attracting panels, and frames. \u201cI use warm soapy water, and dry it instantly with a clean dry microfibre cloth.\u201d Spruce up your sofa and soft furnishings If you are spending a lot more time on the sofa, you may as well improve your environment. Give it a thorough vacuum, including in the crevices and under the seat pads. \u201cGet a damp microfibre cloth and gently rub at any stains,\u201d says MacKenzie. \u201cIf you have ingrained dirt, borrow a steam cleaner. Check the labels of your cushion covers \u2013 some can be washed. I wouldn\u2019t wash feathered cushion pads, but most are synthetic fibres so follow the washing instructions.\u201d Pull out the sofa and vacuum underneath. \u201cBehind it, you\u2019ll see a massive layer of dust on the skirting board. That\u2019s where a lot of dust mites are.\u201d Clean your cleaning tools Finally, give your cleaning tools some attention. \u201cString mops give me the heebie-jeebies,\u201d says MacKenzie. \u201cA much better mop is a flat-headed one, with a cloth pad you take off after each time you wash your floor and stick in the washing machine. I wash my dustpan brush in the kitchen sink and dry it outside.\u201d Show your vacuum cleaner some love. Many have washable filters; the brush head will probably be clogged with hair. \u201cGet a small pair of scissors and snip right down the middle [of the tightly rolled hair]. It takes a while but it\u2019s terribly satisfying.\u201d Bray uses a new dishcloth each day and saves them up until they can go in the washing machine on a hot wash. But she cautions against overdoing it. On her 100,000-strong Facebook group, \u201ca lot of them are prone to overcleaning. I always tell people just do what you need to do and don\u2019t feel you have to be cleaning all day, because otherwise it can turn into a bit of an unhealthy obsession.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
