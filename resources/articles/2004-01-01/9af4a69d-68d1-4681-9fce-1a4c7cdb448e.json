Yesterday came the results of scientific research that indicated that a quarter of land animals and plants could be rendered extinct by 2050. Then, today, the government's chief scientist, David King, claimed that climate change was more of a threat to the world than terrorism. Here we present top tips from Friends of the Earth to help you to do your bit to minimise the problem. 1. Choose green energy Everyone can now choose a green electricity tariff. Buy your electricity from a supplier that supports renewable energy sources, such as wind power and biomass. Earlier this month Friends of the Earth published its guide to green electricity tariffs. The four recommended are Ecotricity 121 (Ecotricity), RSPB Energy (Scottish and Southern Energy, Unit[e] (Unit Energy Ltd) and, in Northern Ireland only, Eco Energy (Northern Ireland electricity). 2. Save energy - and cut your fuel bills too Around a quarter of all carbon dioxide emissions we produce is from energy to heat and light our homes and power household appliances. Using this energy more efficiently will reduce emissions and save money on fuel bills too. \u00b7Fit compact fluorescent (energy efficient) light bulbs. They produce the same light as ordinary bulbs but only use a fifth of the energy and last eight times longer. \u00b7Stop heat escaping by draught-proofing doors and windows, insulating your loft and lagging your boiler and pipes. \u00b7Switch off appliances when they are not in use, and don't leave the television on standby. \u00b7When choosing a new appliance, such as a fridge, freezer or washing machine, ask for energy efficient models. 3. Cut down on your car journeys Road transport accounts for around a quarter of UK greenhouse gas emissions. Car use is growing, but many journeys are unnecessary. Around 22% of all journeys that people make are less than one mile, and 42% less than two miles. \u00b7Walk, cycle or use public transport wherever possible. \u00b7If you use a car, investigate the possibility of car-sharing. When buying a new car, choose the most fuel efficient model available or look at cars powered by alternative fuels. \u00b7See if your work will give you an interest-free loan for a public transport season ticket or to buy a bike. Some firms also pay a cycle mile allowance as well. \u00b7Boycott Esso garages. Esso backed President Bush's decision to tear up the Kyoto Protocol, the only international treaty to combat climate change. 4. Reduce air journeys too Aviation is already the fastest growing source of carbon dioxide. And with the Government's recent decision to expand airports to allow a huge increase in air travel, it will grow even more. \u00b7Consider the environmental impacts of cheap air travel. There are numerous holiday destinations close to home. Many short-haul journeys could also be made by train. 5. Reduce waste and recycle more The UK has one of the worst recycling records in Europe. We recycle less waste than most of our neighbours. It takes more energy to make products from virgin materials than it does by using recycled materials. \u00b7Reduce the amount of waste you generate by avoiding over-packaged goods, saying no to unwanted plastic bags and re-using materials where possible (such as milk bottles). \u00b7Make use of local recycling facilities, but avoid making special recycling car journeys. Ask your local authority to introduce doorstep recycling if you don't already have it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
