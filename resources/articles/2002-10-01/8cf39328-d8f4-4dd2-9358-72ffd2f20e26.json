Healey looked to have secured a fiercely-contested, if error-strewn, game with a trademark outside-break following a close-range scrum that took the fly-half clear under the posts in a rerun of the try he scored to beat Munster in Cardiff in last season's final. The Tigers' relief was to prove short-lived, though, with the French prop Franck Tournaire conceding a penalty at a scrum shortly after the restart to allow Neath's man-of-the-match Lee Jarvis to slot his third penalty of the evening. If an early draw in one of the less hazardous pools hardly means Leicester are doomed to relinquish their crown after successive European triumphs, they will still be concerned at the number of errors that allowed Neath to defend a deserved half-time lead. Driven forward by the shrewd boot of Jarvis, a fly-half who has caused the Tigers previous problems, the Welsh All Blacks defended superbly until weariness crept up on them in a frantic final quarter Neath could hardly have wished for conditions better suited to an ambush. Driving rain and heavy traffic also combined to delay the Tigers' arrival and defeats to Pontypridd and Llanelli on their previous two pool visits to Wales had already established a worrying precedent. Even on the train heading west the guard triumphantly announced the next stop as \"Neath, Neath, Neath!\" and, with the club's time-honoured battle cry ringing out from the stands, the accompanying booing of Healey's name before kick-off was as predictable as the blood and thunder exchanges that followed. Simply clinging on to the greasy ball was Leicester's first challenge and a string of penalties against them gave Jarvis, who had missed an early long-range effort, the chance to put his side 6-0 up by the start of the second quarter. In contrast to last May's final at the Millennium Stadium there was no convenient sliding roof to protect the Tigers from the Welsh elements and another fumble at a lineout cost the visitors their best chance of a first-half try after they had chosen to kick for the corner rather than allow Tim Stimpson a shot at goal. Stimpson did land a well-struck penalty soon afterwards, only for Neath to surge back downfield and score a hugely popular try in the 34th minute when Jarvis's deft chip over a flat defensive line allowed the centre Dave Tieuti to dive over unopposed. With Jarvis adding the easy conversion, Leicester were reminded that there is no such thing as an easy away game in Europe. They were grateful for Stimpson's second penalty in injury-time which narrowed Neath's half-time lead to 13-6, but there were only fleeting signs of the forward stranglehold which has bailed the Tigers out of similar tight corners in the past. The 26-year-old Jarvis, capped once by Wales, was the boot behind Pontypridd's 18-11 win over Leicester in this competition two years ago but the burning question this time was whether the modern Neath pack could summon up the spirit of their shaven-headed predecessors and hold on to their advantage in front of a crowd of 6,835, their biggest since the Springboks' visit in November 1994. With the rain easing slightly, though, Stimpson dragged his side back to within four points and, despite two further missed attempts, Healey ensured the Tigers did not head home empty-handed.
