He said the anxiety expressed by unions and politicians was unwarranted and obscured a story of growth in profits and jobs triggered by private equity deals; the industry was far from the image of aggressive asset strippers painted by critics. The dislike of such firms, given support by several candidates for the Labour party deputy leadership, led Tony Blair to also reject accusations of short-termism and profiteering, after close questioning at his monthly press conference. The prime minister said: \"Britain is one of the number one places in the world for private equity, and I think the private equity market brings a lot of benefits to our economy. \"Some of those who are private equity people or venture capitalists have performed an important function in our economy.\" The protest in Frankfurt outside the SuperReturn industry summit was intended to warn of a \"growing threat\" to jobs from private equity firms, which buy and sell companies using money raised mainly from institutional investors such as pension funds, banks, and wealthy individuals; they pride themselves on transforming under-performing companies and generating 20% or more returns for their investors. But a flurry of activity last year has seen many prominent brand names fall to private equity buyers, which unions claim are asset strippers, making staff redundant or intimidating them to maximise short term profits. A delegation of UK workers outside the conference said they believed the sale of their employers into private equity hands had resulted in cuts to jobs and benefits, and a downturn in labour relations. The GMB, which represents protesters from parking firm NCP, Birdseye (former frozen foods arm of Unilever) and the roadside rescue firm AA, has campaigned against what it sees as the creeping influence of private equity firms. Last week it revealed links between industry figures and donations to the Labour party, and called on the party to investigate. Mr Bonderman said private equity remained only a small proportion of activity in global capital markets. He also told delegates at the SuperReturn conference in Frankfurt that he was a long term investor, not an asset-stripper. \"Private equity allows me to make long-term decisions and make investments in companies that are not valued by the market,\" he said. He played down the industry's significance, describing its total assets as a \"rounding error\" alongside the scale of transactions in global capital markets. He also pointed to a Harvard University report which argued such firms increased employment and growth in the economy, echoing analysis by Nottingham University; the latter's study of 400 management buy-outs and buy-ins found that private equity investment not only increased employment over the longer term but also led to improved worker involvement and trust. Mr Bonderman said the industry's record year in 2006 would be bettered in 2007, and growth was assured for several years to come. \"Public to private deals are only 3% of the market, which suggests there is plenty of room for more activity,\" he said - adding, with a hint of irony, \"and more room for those people who feel anxiety about private equity to feel anxiety.\" Mr Bonderman hit the headlines over the weekend following the agreed take-over of the US energy firm TXU Corp; his firm, Texas Pacific is one of the main partners in the $45bn deal, the largest private equity deal to date. Texas Pacific took the airline Qantas private and took part in the reflotation of Debenhams on the London stock market, and has come in for criticism from unions, most notably in Germany, where it suffered a long strike at the Dusseldorf base of privately owned airline caterer Gate Gourmet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
