The Tigers have been significantly reshaped this season, with Danny Orr brought home after five years in London to steer the development of a crop of gifted products of one of British rugby league's more prolific nurseries, and the signs so far are that their coach, Terry Matterson, has hit on a winning formula. It was hard to judge the quality of their opening victory over Wakefield, who were then in administration, but beating the Giants takes some doing, off-colour as they were here. Orr's combination with the livewire Maori stand-off Rangi Chase is already working well, and with overseas players like Ryan McGoldrick and Willie Isa still to come into the side, the Tigers look good to challenge for a top-eight place at least. \"It's good to be back, and I'm loving every minute,\" said Orr, while Matterson drew attention to the fact that Cas missed only three tackles in the whole 80 minutes and fielded nine homegrown players, five of them under the age of 20. \"It's taken a while to build this team, and we're really pleased with where we are at the moment,\" said the coach. He was almost as happy to reflect on a game in which the referee, Steve Ganson, did not award a penalty until the 24th minute, whereas the Wakefield game had been marred by a Super League record of 37. \"We had a different referee with a different attitude,\" he added. \"That's the way people want to watch rugby league.\" After the unsettling and underwhelming experiment of opening the season with a full round of fixtures in Cardiff, this was all reassuringly old-fashioned, as the two Yorkshire clubs served up a tough, attritional contest in heavy conditions. The Huddersfield pack were renowned as one of the toughest in the Super League even before they signed Luke O'Donnell, an Australian second-row with a lengthy disciplinary record, but Castleford's comparatively raw and unsung forwards stood up to them manfully. Breaks were rare, but the game was none the worse for that, and when Orr found a first small chink in Huddersfield's defence on halfway, it led directly to the game's opening try \u2013 for Nick Youngquest, from Chase's delicate chip. Kirk Dixon curled over the touchline conversion, then extended the lead to 8-0 when Ganson broke his penalty duck. Huddersfield visibly lifted their pace and intensity at the start of the second half, and cut the deficit to two points when Danny Brough converted Jermaine MacGilvray's well-taken try. They would have been ahead if Kevin Brown had been able to take Lee Gilmour's inside pass on their next attack. Instead Cas came again, with a couple of horribly scrappy tries from Youngquest and Joe Arundel that were nevertheless things of beauty to their passionate supporters. \"Ray Charles could have seen that the first one came from a strip,\" said Huddersfield's coach, Nathan Brown, but the video referee awarded Cas the benefit of the doubt. \"The hungrier team won,\" Brown admitted. \"You could see after five minutes we weren't where we needed to be.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
