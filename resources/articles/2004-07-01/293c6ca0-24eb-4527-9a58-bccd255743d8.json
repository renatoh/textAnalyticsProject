The group also said it has agreed to sell Contact Centre, its call centre business which employs almost 1,000 people, and was reviewing what to do with its Interactive scratch card business, which was not performing to expectations. The news saw the share price fall almost a fifth despite reassurances that it remained \"comfortable\" with expectations for the year. The shares closed down 4.5p at 19.6p. Chief executive William Allen said the rate of revenue growth in the first quarter was stronger than at the end of the last financial year and the firm had positive free cash flow in each of the last three quarters. He said the firm was seeing the fastest growth in data and telecoms services while broadband was replacing narrow band dial-up internet access. Such services commanded narrower margins although they were also less capital intensive, he said. \"Although we remain cautious on the general economic outlook and the competitive dynamics of the existing market structure for UK telecommunications, adjusting for the Interactive segment and the disposal of the Contact Centre, we remain comfortable with the range of market expectations for the full year.\" Christian Maher, an analyst at Investec Securities, said he was cutting his forecast for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the year to next March from \u00a358.6m to \u00a349.3m. \"We welcome the disposal of the call centre operation but note the material deterioration in trading at the Interactive business and continued margin weakness in the core business.\" Thus has agreed to sell Contact Centre to RHL, part of Murray International Holdings, for \u00a31.75m and will keep the call centre operation's working capital, which it put at \u00a32.25m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
