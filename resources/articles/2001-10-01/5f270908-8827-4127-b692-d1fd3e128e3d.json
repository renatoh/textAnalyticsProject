Seconds before the plane crash, according to a report in Kommersant, the pilot of the Tupolev-154, which was en route from Tel Aviv to Novosibirsk in Siberia, said: \"Where are we hit?\" It reports Vladimir Zhukov, deputy chief of Russia's North Caucasus air traffic control, as saying: \"This is all we heard: the pilot asked one of his crew, 'Where are we hit?'\" Mr Zhukov added: \"It looks like he was trying to get precise information about the damage caused by the missile explosion.\" Investigators now have little doubt that Sibir Airlines Flight 1812 was destroyed by a Ukrainian S200 anti-aircraft missile, fired during a military exercise on the Crimean peninsula. They believe the missile did not hit directly but exploded metres away, shooting shrapnel into the plane. Missiles such as the S200 typically spray shrapnel upon detonation. Experts believe that the damaged plane, with the pilot and most of those on board still alive, then dived into the Black Sea. The black box flight recorder still lies on the seabed, too deep for easy retrieval. None of the bodies examined showed injuries typical of an air disaster, according to Igor Shipanov, a senior forensic expert at the mortuary in the Black Sea port of Sochi, where some of the 15 bodies recovered have been examined. \"Our opinion is that the people died not in the air but from the impact of the water, which from such a height is the equivalent of the impact of asphalt,\" he told Kommersant. Earlier this week a Russian investigator, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, said they had found what they believed were missile parts in the wreckage of the plane. At first the Ukrainian armed forces denied responsibility, saying the missiles did not have the range to reach the airliner, but have backtracked. Within a day, the prime minister, Anatoly Kinakh, admitted that the missile theory \"had a right to exist\", and on Tuesday President Leonid Kuchma, who once managed the Soviet Union's biggest missile factory, said he would accept the crash investigator's conclusions. He also said that the Ukrainian defence minister had tendered his resignation, which had not been accepted. He vowed that someone would \"bear responsibility\" if the missile theory proved correct. Last year a missile hit the town of Borvary, killing four people. The armed forces denied responsibility until missile fragments were found in the rubble of destroyed houses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
