It was by no means a vintage performance from the big South African, not least because it included a couple of slack bogeys and one of the flukier pars he is ever likely to make after he hit his tee shot on the 12th into what a golfer would describe as tall rough and a botanist would call jungle. \"I didn't think I was going to find it but, when I did, I found I could take a swing, so I did. It was a case of hit and hope but I have been a good boy this week, so I got it out,\" he said, grinning. Els escaped with a par four and later walked off the final green after making a birdie, reducing his overnight deficit on the tournament leaders to three shots. That was heartening enough but even more encouraging were the names of those above him on the leaderboard. Gr\u00e9gory Havret, the leader with a 10-under-par total of 132, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Lara, one shot back, and Andres Romero, two shots back, are all good European Tour players but they will not send shivers down the spine of a world-class player such as Els. Phil Mickelson, on the other hand, would scare the life out of anyone, especially on this form. The American left-hander has traditionally used his visit to the Bonny Banks as a warm-up, albeit an incongruous one, for the Open. But this year he is wearing the face of a man with serious intent. He is also playing like one. He shot a six-under-par 65 to tie for the first-round lead and yesterday added a 68 to move to nine under for the tournament and will head into the weekend as the favourite. The tournament organisers would never admit as much in public but, as they slept last night, their dreams will have danced with images of Els and Mickelson walking down the fairways together in Sunday's final group. No one would deny them such fantasies, although there are plenty of players near the top of the leaderboard who are capable of bringing them to an abrupt halt, not least the leader, Havret. The Frenchman arrived in Scotland in a rich seam of form. He finished tied for third in the European Open last week and has recently hooked up with the seemingly ubiquitous \"mind guru\" Jos Vanstiphout, whose record in turning golfing Clark Kents into golfing supermen is uncanny. Havret also has the additional motivation of requiring a victory here to guarantee his place in the Open next week. Carnoustie could do with a new Frenchman in the field now that the most famous French golfer of all, Jean van de Velde, will not be there. \"The last time at Carnoustie I was watching the end of the tournament with some friends in France. We watched all day long and I was just crying at the end,\" Havret recalled wistfully. \"It was very hard for Jean but people forget how well he played for 71 holes.\" They do but golf is nothing if not capricious; one week you are a champ, the next a chump. Just ask Colin Montgomerie. The Scotsman, winner of the European Open at the K Club on Sunday, turned up at Loch Lomond garlanded in smiles and departed last night after missing the cut with a face like a man who had downed a carton of sour milk. \"It's a putting competition out there and I didn't putt well,\" he said after a three-over-par 74."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
