There is a risk that you will be bombed on your way to work by terrorists. Should you manage to get through the day unscathed, there's a risk of you catching avian flu, BSE, or being washed away by a tsunami or obliterated by a hurricane as you lie in bed dreaming of happier times. As if we didn't have enough to worry about, a new paper from Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute warns that we have underestimated the risk of exogenous planetary disaster. A microscopic black hole or a collision of cosmic rays could wipe out not just Earth but the whole observable universe at any moment. True, the chances of this doomsday catastrophe happening are, the paper estimates, 1,000,000,000 to 1, but let's not be complacent. Ulrich Beck has not made a career of calculating risks, still less trying to reduce them. The German professor has thrived as a professional Cassandra, diagnosing the optimistic futility with which we try to manage the unmanageable. He's written widely about the riskiness of the insecure new world of work, about the perils of globalisation and what he calls tragic individualisation. This last concept is particularly salutary. \"The individual,\" Beck will say in a lecture to be delivered in London next week, \"must cope with the uncertainty of the global world by him or herself. Here individualisation is a default outcome of a failure of expert systems to manage risks. Neither science, nor the politics in power, nor the mass media, nor business, nor the law nor even the military are in a position to define or control risks rationally.\" This, I suggest, is not an upbeat message. \"We are living in a world that is beyond controllability,\" Beck retorts with a shrug. The 61-year-old sociology professor at Munich's Ludwig-Maximilian University and the London School of Economics is, despite this dismal worldview, a disarmingly avuncular, duffle-coated bear of a man - two parts Paddington to three parts tough-minded critical theorist. \"I'm talking about a situation where normal instruments of calculating, anticipating and colonising the future don't work any more,\" he says, smiling, over tea at the LSE. One of the side-effects of capitalism's triumph is that it makes our lives more risky, precisely when we try to make them more secure and comfortable, says Beck. \"The success of modernity - the better technology, the better production of markets - increases all kinds of risk,\" he says. At the same time nations restrict civil rights in order to protect their populations from terrorism \"with the result that, in the end, open, free society may be abolished, but the terrorist threat is by no means averted\". The professor coined the jaunty-sounding German term Risikogesellschaft or \"risk society\" in 1986 and then had to wait for several years for an incredulous world to grasp what he was on about. \"I was looking for a basic term to characterise the second modernity.\" For Beck, it's worth pointing out, the first modernity was a period in which nation states, at least in the west, could be relied on to provide democracy, economic growth and security. The second modernity, by contrast, is defined for Beck by global ecological and economic crises, widening transnational inequalities, precarious forms of paid work and other challenges of globalisation that those nation states can't manage efficiently on their own. \"Post-modernity\" wouldn't do. \"I didn't like that term because this was used by blind people who don't know what's going on. I forced myself to think what is the new concept and it became clear to me that it was risk, not only in technology and ecology, but in life and employment, too.\" But he had to wait for sceptics to catch up with this thinking. The Americans, for example, thought he was way off track. \"I held a conference in Harvard where Americans said they didn't believe in risk. They thought it was just European hysteria. Then the terrorist attacks happened and there was a complete conversion. Suddenly terrorism was the central risk.\" Beck argues we have tried to deal with new risks by old means, using national states to tackle global problems. He's especially interested in what he calls the protectionist reflex by nation states behaving as though they were inhabiting the first modernity when, as Beck would tell them if only they listened, we are living in the second modernity. In his new book, Power in the Global Age, he writes that this reflex \"has paralysed Europe as well as other parts of the world, both intellectually and politically, since the collapse of the bipolar world order\". What do you mean by that? Beck tells the story of a drunk man who loses his wallet on a dark night. The drunk is looking for it under a street light when a passer-by comes up and asks: \"Did you lose your wallet here?\" \"No,\" the drunk replies, \"but at least I can look for it in the light.\" This is what modern nation states are like - committed to futile attempts at problem-solving. Consider what the French interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, announced earlier this week to oust immigrant families from France who refuse to integrate. Or consider, Beck says topically, Denmark. \"It's a very unreflective homogeneous culture and the least open in western Europe. They have increasing immigration but still an unreflective interpretation of what it involves. They think the distinction between outside and inside still works. It does not.\" On the controversial cartoons depicting Muhummad, Beck invoked the German philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas's distinction between secular and post-secular societies. \"The basic assumption of the secular society is that modernity overcomes religion. In this sense most continental European countries seem to exist as secular states, while Britain and America seem to be post-secular - they see atheism is only one of the belief systems and that religion still is an important voice of humanity.\" Would you have published the cartoons? \"No. It's important to fight for freedom of speech, but it has to be related to principle. You can't play with these freedoms. You have to be very careful not to hurt religious feelings.\" Are you religious? \"Not at all. Max Weber [the German sociologist] said he was unmusical when it comes to religion. I'm like that, too. But it's important to understand that not everybody is going to be an atheist.\" Was that assumption ever plausible? \"It was the assumption of most social theory. All theory of modernity in sociology suggests that the more modernity there is, the less religion. In my theory we can realise that this is wrong: atheism is only one belief system among many.\" \"How to live,\" Beck asks in his lecture, \"when old certainties are shattered or revealed as lies?\" His answer is cosmopolitanism.\"The cosmopolitan model is about acknowledging difference and the dignity of difference,\" he says. \"I think it's a matter of survival in this explosive, risky, global society.\" It involves not only securing human rights at a transnational level but also what he calls a politics of golden handcuffs, the creation of a dense network of transnational interdependencies to secure human rights, to scupper cheap wages, insecure employment, tax havens and other intolerable symptoms of globalisation. The foundations of the cosmopolitan regime are already in place, says Beck, in the form of the international criminal court, the Kyoto protocol on climate change and conventions on arms control, but he argues that there should be more - new institutions, democratic reforms of the IMF and World Bank. Beck, clearly, has a political agenda opposed to unfettered globalised capitalism. But he insists there is much more to cosmopolitanism than that. Indeed, Beck has two more volumes on the way to complete his trilogy describing what power is like and what it should be like in the global age. \"Look,\" he says, \"we're just at the beginning of this discussion. I am not pretending that it is a panacea, but all these other isms - neo-liberalism, nationalism, fundamentalism - somehow they don't work any more in globalisation. Cosmpolitanism could do.\" That said, there are some global risks that even cosmopolitanism will not be able to eliminate. A microscopic black hole could turn up tomorrow and consume everything including Professor Beck's vision of a less horrible world, but, reassuringly, that isn't likely. Beck on cosmopolitanism This idea just might make the improbable possible, namely the survival of humanity beyond the 21st century without a lapse back into barbarism On terrorism Terrorist networks can be thought of as NGOs committed to violence. While Greenpeace tackles environmental crises ... terrorist NGOs have the state monopoly on violence in their sights On fear What we are seeing emerge are the emotionalities and irrationalities of communities of fear, which may very well provide fertile soil for radical groups committed to violence On America A strange kind of discourse has developed in the US ... The idea appears to be that it is necessary to turn everyone into Americans, so that Americans are able to live in safety in a world without borders \u00b7 Power in the Global Age is published by Polity. Ulrich Beck's public lecture Living in World Risk Society will be at the LSE on Wednesday.
