Asked by Republican senator Jeff Sessions whether she would support legalization, Lynch replied: \u201cSenator \u2013 I do not.\u201d \u201cI do not support legalization of marijuana; it\u2019s not the position of the Department of Justice currently to support the legalization, nor would it be the position should I become confirmed as attorney general,\u201d Lynch said. Lynch\u2019s testimony did not stray far from the Justice Department\u2019s current stance. While Holder refused to challenge legalization in Colorado and Washington, he also did not change thefederal government\u2019s stance on what is currently a Schedule I controlled substance, in common with heroin. In April 2014, after legalization in those states, Holder issued eight priorities for the department, leaving out marijuana prosecution. \u201cIt essentially means that the federal government is not going to be involved in the prosecution of small-time, possessory drug cases,\u201d Holder said, as reported by the Huffington Post. \u201cBut we never were, so I\u2019m not sure that I see a huge change yet.\u201d Holder added he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the states\u2019 efforts. Holder took heat for refusing to challenge Colorado and Washington\u2019s ban. He also softened the department\u2019s prosecution of non-violent drug offenders, an attempt to avoid imposing mandatory minimum sentences for offences involving substances such as marijuana. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has expressed a much more rigid stance toward marijuana legalization. At one point, a DEA official told the House oversight committee that \u201cevery single parent out there\u201d was against legalization. Since Colorado and Washington legalized marijuana, prosecutors in Brooklyn have stopped charging marijuana violators. Voters in Washington DC voted for the legalization of recreational marijuana."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
