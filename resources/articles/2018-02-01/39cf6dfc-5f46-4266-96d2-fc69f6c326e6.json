Jones had initially hoped to take his squad to Tbilisi to face what he has described as \u201cthe strongest scrum pack in the world\u201d but Georgia are now due in London for training sessions scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday during the first fallow week of the tournament. Both forwards sessions will be similar to that arranged with Wales in November with a focus on scrummaging and lineouts and are further evidence of Jones leaving no stone unturned as England prepare to face Scotland on Saturday week. Increasingly Jones sees England\u2019s scrum as a key part of their armoury for the 2019 World Cup and, while they opened their Six Nations campaign with seven tries against Italy, he chose to laud the best scrummaging performance during his tenure. Jones has also recruited the former France hooker Marc Dal Maso as a consultant to assist the scrum coach, Neal Hatley, and it is understood the Rugby Football Union will contribute to the cost of Georgia\u2019s 5,000-mile round trip as England seek to fine-tune their set piece further. \u201cWe want to have the best scrum in the world and they\u2019re the biggest, ugliest, strongest scrum pack in the world,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we want to scrummage against them? It\u2019s fantastic. We\u2019re good friends with their two coaches, Milton Haig and Richard Graham \u2013 a Kiwi and an Aussie. They were keen on the idea and it suits us perfectly.\u201d Jones likes to maximise England\u2019s training camps and this week is another example of how he will not allow his players to settle into a comfort zone, relocating his squad from their Bagshot base to west London. In the build-up to the 12-6 victory against Wales on Saturday he rearranged their training schedule to combat a six-day turnaround from their opening win in Rome and this week there will be no let-up from the Australian. \u201cWe want to win the Six Nations but we\u2019re also using this as a trial for the World Cup, so it\u2019s a great opportunity for us to get some really quality scrum practice in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be practice but we will do the same number of scrums that we would have in a game.\u201d Against Wales Anthony Watson and Sam Simmonds were withdrawn with injuries but Jones was hopeful both would be fit to face Scotland. Nathan Hughes, who came off the bench for Wasps on Sunday to make a first appearance since sustaining a knee injury in December, will also be in contention while Joe Marler is available to bolster the scrum with his ban due to expire on Tuesday next week. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking to improve our scrum,\u201d said the captain, Dylan Hartley. \u201cIt has been going well for us. By mixing it up and training against someone different we will find something out about ourselves and we will learn. It will be a really useful tool and I\u2019m sure they will take something from it as well. \u201cIf I scrum against Jamie George, Alec Hepburn and Harry Williams they know what we are trying to do, we know what they are trying to end and we end up negating each other. Every scrum has to be intense otherwise you get folded up like a travel map stuffed in your back pocket.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
