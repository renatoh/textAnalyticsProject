Shot largely on the Isle of Man and set a few centuries hence, Simon Hunter's Mutant Chronicles takes place in a world exhausted by endless trench warfare between four rival corporations called Capitol, Bauhaus, Mishima and Imperial. It starts like All Quiet on the Western Front meets Nineteen Eighty-Four and turns into a futuristic action movie when a seal, many thousand years old, is broken on a buried capsule containing cannibalistic mutants from outer space. A monk (Ron Perlman) recruits an international doughty dozen of military experts for a mission to find and destroy this capsule. Much bonding, killing and self-sacrifice ensues before the world is made safe for what remains of humanity. John Malkovich makes a guest appearance as the world's richest man and appears to be reading his lines as if they were being put up a word at a time and he hadn't been told what role he was playing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
