This week we have another for you which we have shamelessly borrowed from our fellow travellers at Christian Science Monitor: It\u2019s one of the paradoxes of the coronavirus crisis: Local papers are going under even as both readership and public need for solid information soar. With advertisers pulling out, can other financial models offer hope? We feel the paradox keenly at the Guardian as well. So I will do you a deal: if you will consider putting something in the tipbox this week that roughly equates to what you feel this newsletter is worth, we will give you more Upside news than we\u2019ve ever given you before. Here goes: \u2022 The people who recovered from Covid-19. Two-minute read. \u2022 Businesses move into ventilator overdrive. 90-second read. \u2022 The African migrants helping to feed Italy. Two-minute snack. \u2022 The great hope for our oceans. About 30 years. \u2022 How to be isolated: a guide to surviving lockdown, by the people who are good at being alone. Three-minute read. \u2022 How the crisis is reviving our utopian hopes of connection and community 90-second OpEd piece. \u2022 How to manage Covid-19 anxiety. Two minutes. \u2022 A new mini-series: hope in a time of crisis. Daily fix. And in non-coronavirus Upside news: \u2022 The best schools in Brazil Three-minute read. \u2022 How to stop flooding Three-minute read. \u2022 Our best long reads ever. An hour or two. \u2022 The antidote \u2013 most read non-Covid tales. Quick browse. \u2022 New blood test can detect 50 types of cancer. One-minute read. Finally, two of the funniest stories of the week. The first involves a man, some magnets and a pair of very sore nostrils. The second is pure internet gold. Lucky numbers Defence budgets are likely to be a secondary victim of the Covid-19 pandemic. Jane\u2019s, a defence thinktank, reckons spending could be reduced by tens of billions of pounds around the world as a result of the virus. Andrew MacDonald, a Jane\u2019s analyst said: \u201cDefence spending plans in a series of the world\u2019s largest defence markets are on course to be derailed in the near-term by the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d What we liked This piece in the Conversation asked whether the virus might kill off the global wildlife trade. We were humbled by the sports stars who realised there is another kind of heroism, people like Jos Buttler, Marcus Rashford and the Barcelona football team. This piece in the Atlantic is beautiful: the chance to regain a less hurried life. We admired the Boston Globe\u2019s new initiative to connect people in need with people who are able to help. And the LA Times piece on the festival hands now building Covid triage units. Given that we cannot travel at the moment and are restless for new vistas, we also liked this attempt to digitally recreate ruined castles of Europe by NeoMam Studios. And finally there were bouncy rubber pavements, which we thought might have been an early April fool, until it emerged that April Fool\u2019s Day was largely cancelled this year. What we heard With so many of us restricted in our movements, the life-in-lockdown stories have been pouring in. Keep them coming. Lesley Freedman wrote in from lockdown in Sydney We celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary last week in Sydney. It was a covid news-free day! My partner and I rediscovered our wedding photos and watched the video for the first time right through. In the evening we dressed up and connected with four of our special guests online. We wore silly hats, popped champagne on cue and offered each other olives and cheese. For the first time in days we were happy. Adam Mileusnic has also been indoors, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from doing miles on his bike I\u2019m a British guy living in Madrid and have been quarantined in my flat for 15 days now. I livestreamed an eight-hour cycling challenge on my exercise bike for a group of 36 children\u2019s charities affected by the Covid crisis (collectively called Family for Every Child) and raised over \u00a31,000. I came up with the idea after being trapped for so long with only one way to keep moving! You too could emulate Adam\u2019s heroics. Check out connectandride.org. Where was the Upside On balconies everywhere, which are finding a new purpose in life. These are extraordinary times, dear reader \u2013 let us know how it is for you.
