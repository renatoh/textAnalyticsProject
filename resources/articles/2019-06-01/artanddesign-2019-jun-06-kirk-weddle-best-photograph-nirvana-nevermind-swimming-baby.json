Nirvana\u2019s record label, Geffen, came to me with the idea. I was marketing myself as the underwater photography guy at the time. But when they asked me to shoot the sleeve [for Nevermind] I had no idea whether I could do it. Shooting a baby was new for me. I really didn\u2019t want to drown the little guy! I was lucky that my friends had just had a baby, Spencer, and they trusted me with him. The band weren\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar at that point, so the shoot was really small-scale \u2013 there was no art director, no manager or account executive looking over your shoulder. I think I got $1,000 to shoot it \u2013 that was for everything, including the gear and the cost of another rescue diver. I had a snorkel and an underwater camera on a tripod. First, we trained on a doll. Then we took the little guy, blew a little air into his face and eased him into the water. Dad gave him a small shove, he drifted by the camera \u2013 bang, bang, bang, bang, bang \u2013 I shot off five frames. Mum pulls him out, he\u2019s cool, so we go again. Put him in \u2013 bang, bang, bang, bang, bang \u2013 he starts to cry, \u201cOK, we\u2019re done!\u201d We ended up with about 25 frames. It took an hour to set up and five minutes to do. I knew I had the shot. That\u2019s the thing about old-school photography \u2013 as a pro, you have to know that you\u2019ve got it before you leave. But when I looked at it more closely I had some doubts. I thought, \u201cMan, it\u2019s such a dick shot!\u201d His unit was so prominent in the picture \u2026 he\u2019s a well hung kid for a four-month old, you know? I didn\u2019t know if the label would go for it. So I went to a kids\u2019 swim school and got half a dozen other babies in the water. This one girl was 10 months old, she could really motor, so I shot her from the side. But the label loved the original shot of Spencer and went with that. A guy in New York shot the dollar bill. I wish that I\u2019d done that part, too. It would have been easy, but I didn\u2019t care at the time. I\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t have to capture it all in one shot. It\u2019s one thing to drown the kid, but another to stick him on a fishhook! I\u2019m still in contact with Spencer. I used to think, \u201cMan, when that kid is 16 he\u2019s gonna hate my guts!\u201d He doesn\u2019t, but he\u2019s conflicted about the picture. He feels that everybody made money off it and he didn\u2019t. I think he deserves something. But it\u2019s always the record labels that make the money. When Spencer was 10, I recreated the image with him for Rolling Stone. He\u2019s done it a few times since with another shooter, which I don\u2019t like! But we\u2019ve got a good relationship, and I\u2019m still tight with his parents. I still notice new things in the picture. Recently, I realised that you can see a handprint on Spencer\u2019s chest. If you look closely \u2013 that\u2019s his dad\u2019s handprint! For a while after that shot I was the golden child. People were like, \u2018Hey, everything we do should be underwater!\u2019 But the work was sporadic, and it\u2019s a tough medium to work in. The model can\u2019t see or hear you, it\u2019s hard to direct, everything is super slow, it\u2019s like having your feet in mud. I even ended up shooting the band underwater a few months after this shot. That was a hairy job. Looking back, I could have done things differently. I thought 10am would be a nice time of day for them, but of course if you\u2019re in a band it\u2019s not \u2013 they were pissed off when they turned up. It was a rare cold, grey day in California, and there were problems with the pool so that was cold, too. The band hadn\u2019t been told about it, so they were, like, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get in the water?\u201d And then the label didn\u2019t like the shots \u2013 they wanted something slicker. They said: \u201cWe don\u2019t like Kurt Cobain\u2019s hair!\u201d I thought, man, there ain\u2019t nothing I can do about his hair! But those images are really popular now. Of course, if I\u2019d shot this for some band that never went anywhere we wouldn\u2019t be talking about it now \u2013 it\u2019d just be a cool picture in a filing cabinet. It\u2019s a big deal to a lot of people, but not to me. I\u2019m proud of how it turned out, but I don\u2019t sit around looking at it. Having said that, I\u2019m going to recreate the image again this summer. I want to shoot a girl diving into a pool, going after a cellphone \u2013 because every teenage girl I ever see now is on their phone. I\u2019d also like to shoot Spencer again, but with him totally naked like in the original. He\u2019s 27 now, and has some really good tats these days. Maybe I should call him up.
