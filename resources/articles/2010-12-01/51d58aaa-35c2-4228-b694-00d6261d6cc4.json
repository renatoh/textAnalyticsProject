It was popular in his lifetime, though his eventual dismissal of the score as a youthful aberration has rendered it non-canonical in some eyes. It has also proved dangerous. It was one of Hitler's favourite operas, and though some have argued that its politics are far from national socialism, its relentless evocations of parades, rallies and march-pasts unquestionably affected Nazi aesthetics. Philipp St\u00f6lzl's production, which opened at Berlin's Deutsche Oper earlier this year, bravely grapples with the issues it raises by reimagining it in terms of 20th-century dictatorship and presenting it as a warning from history. Some of the design details are non-specific, but allusions first to Weimar Republic painting, then to Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda films leave us in no doubt that Germany is where we're meant to be. Torsten Kerl is a convincingly horrible dictator, with Camilla Nylund as his fanatical, possibly incestuous sister Irene. The real vocal honours, however, go to Kate Aldrich's Adriano, played as a morally aware, Stauffenberg-type resistance leader."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
