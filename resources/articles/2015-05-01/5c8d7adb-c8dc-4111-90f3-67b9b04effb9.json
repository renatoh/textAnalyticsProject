Amid the laughter and the banter it is easy to forget that Dyche\u2019s team have slipped to the bottom of the table with four matches remaining. Perhaps that is the intention, though it may also be true that upbeat is the only style Dyche knows. The Burnley team famously does not change from week to week and neither does its manager. Ben Mee, the club\u2019s left-back, can confirm Dyche is the same in training. Always bright, always encouraging, never showing any signs of being under pressure. \u201cAs a group we are very together. We have come through a lot and we are ready for more,\u201d Mee says. \u201cThe manager is a big part of that. He keeps us all going, makes sure that, whatever happens, we believe in ourselves and are fully prepared for the next challenge. We are not fooling ourselves. We know we have a massive fight on our hands to get out of this situation but the manager\u2019s positivity rubs off on everyone else.\u201d Burnley have been something of a tonic all season, with their old-fashioned 4-4-2, their limited pool of players and their splendidly competitive attitude against clubs that have been in the top flight for decades longer, though it is beginning to look as if time may be running out for an escape from the bottom three. While Leicester and Queens Park Rangers have lately shown signs of recovery, Burnley have not managed to score a goal since the victory over Manchester City in March that had the town buzzing with possibility. Performances have been consistent \u2013 Dyche would even argue that last week\u2019s damaging home defeat by Leicester was one of the best displays of the season \u2013 but from appearing to be the team most likely to climb the table a few weeks ago Burnley have sunk to the bottom. They need to start winning, preferably at West Ham United on Saturday afternoon, and Dyche does not need telling that there is no longer any margin for error. \u201cThe reality is that a tough job has got tougher,\u201d the manager says. \u201cWe are not too disheartened about our position because three points can still change the picture completely but I can\u2019t keep pointing to the stats because stats don\u2019t win games. Goals win games and they also change the feel of a side, give you a boost when you need it. Right now we need it. Our shape has been good all season. We have never found ourselves tactically out-manoeuvred by opponents. Our energy is great and the belief is still there but it is the clinical side we have to put right in the next four games. We are still doing a lot of good things, even against the top teams, but we need to take more of our chances.\u201d Relegation would not be the ruin of Burnley. They are run along sustainable lines, though it irks Dyche that a season of hard work could count for nothing because the goals have dried up. \u201cWe have tried everything we know,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have had three centre-forwards on the pitch at times and we are the only team in the division to play with two up front in every game. We believed we could be higher up the table than we are but nothing has really changed. \u201cWe were everybody\u2019s favourites to go down at the start of the season so you can\u2019t say our situation has come out of the blue. We didn\u2019t have a win in our first 10 games but we got over it. Being written off is nothing new.\u201d Mee remembers the initial winless run all too clearly. \u201cWe thought we were playing well enough to get results but they just didn\u2019t come,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same now but we feel we have some winnable games coming up and it is time to start winning them. Last week\u2019s result was frustrating after the way we played but the determination is still there for the next game. It doesn\u2019t matter that much to us if people are talking about relegation. That\u2019s how we started last season, in the Championship. Everyone said we would go down and we ended up getting promoted. \u201cLooked at as a whole, we have had an incredible couple of years. We have achieved a lot, both as a club and as individuals. We are strong as a group and the manager has brought a lot of the lads\u2019 games on in his time here. It\u2019s been great playing the top teams in the Premier League in front of full houses every week. Naturally you want more of that but, whatever happens, it has been a good time to be connected with Burnley. The club has definitely evolved and grown.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
