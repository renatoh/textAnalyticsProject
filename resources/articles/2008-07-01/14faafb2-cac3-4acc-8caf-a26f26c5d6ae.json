The basic idea and storyline follow the movie, with your trash-compacting bot charged with cleaning up the planet, scoring extra points for solving bonus objectives. It plays like a 3D platform game, with a roaming but often confusing camera to complicate things further. You can also play as a second robot, Eve, which has different abilities, allowing the two to work together, flicking switches or disabling obstacles. But given Pixar's reputation, it's surprising the graphics aren't better. Wall-E is charming enough for kids, but grown-up gamers deserved more development time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
