And in Australia especially it was all the more impressive for that. The day when Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe are surpassed, for longevity at any rate, is not a day for egotism, it is a day for humility, and Strauss's sense of perspective on one of the finest days of his career provided further proof that English cricket is in good hands. \u2022 Interactive guide to all the Ashes venues \u2022 Sign up now for our weekly email The Spin \u2022 How to stay awake during the Tests \u2022 Follow our daily blog throughout the Ashes \u2022 The latest news and comment on our Ashes site If Strauss and Cook, with 3,415 runs, now surpass Hobbs and Sutcliffe (3,249), a careless suggestion that they had \"beaten\" them brought a snort in the media centre from one of cricket's most eminent historians. Hobbs and Sutcliffe averaged 87 runs per stand, more than double the 42 of Strauss and Cook, but then they should not feel too shaken by that; the record of Hobbs and Sutcliffe dwarfs all-comers. \"People have been talking about this record for about six months and since then we have been averaging about 10 as an opening partnership,\" Strauss joked. \"It is good. I suppose those sort of records come because the two of you stay in the side and you need quite a lot of resilience to be able to do that.\" Hobbs and Sutcliffe were an institution. Hobbs, The Master, was genial and unassuming; Sutcliffe's brilliantined hair came with an equally orderly, flattened-down temperament. They stole singles telepathically. Strauss and Cook are a long way from being an institution but they, too, have developed a character. Strauss is the more assertive, more eager to carry the fight; Cook is the fighter, a batsman for whom first impressions are entirely misleading. They also stole singles today, although that was primarily because Ricky Ponting allowed them. Resilience might be Cook's middle name. He was called \"elegant\" on Australian radio as he dutifully assembled his first Ashes hundred in Australia, but he was leaning on his bat at the non-striker's end at the time. It probably had a lot to do with his film-star looks. When Cook gets to the business end, the overriding message is not one of elegance but that he is tougher than he looks. \"Cookie is a very resilient character,\" Strauss emphasised. \"He is able to do the hard yards as he has demonstrated in this game.\" He could have added that he had argued passionately for Cook's survival when there was pressure to drop him before the final Test at The Oval last summer. His faith has been vindicated. Cook returned the favour, verbally rotating the strike as the best openers do. \"Straussy set the tone today,\" he said. \"We are very similar minded and we suit each other. We don't get too flustered about a lot of things and we keep things in perspective. If someone bowls a really good ball, we laugh it off and move on to the next one.\" Australia know better than any cricketing nation that modern-day achievement must go hand in hand with an awareness of what has gone before. Strauss began his second innings with Australian cricketing historians comparing his batting record in Australia to Mike Brearley's (not necessarily a good thing); he ended it being mentioned in the same breath as Hobbs. That is not a bad day's work. You always know Australia are dominating an Ashes when Don Bradman gets a mention. \"Best since Bradman\" is the invariable cry as another Aussie tyro seeks to make his own dent on cricket history. In Australia even Don Corleone would have to bow the knee to Don Bradman. English cricket has never quite agreed on its champion; a sense of history is often disappointingly lacking, no surprise considering secondary school curriculums. But this was a day when Strauss and Cook stood next to not only Hobbs and Sutcliffe but also Len Hutton and Charlie Barnett, the last England openers both to make hundreds in an Ashes Test \u2013 at Trent Bridge 72 years ago. If The Gabba was flat, Trent Bridge on that day was reputedly flatter; England declared at 658 for eight. Hutton was Yorkshire's finest and a bit of a social climber to boot. Barnett sounds like a bit of a snob. After he retired, one journalist suggested he was running a fish shop. He wrote back indignantly, saying he was not a fishmonger but a purveyor of high-class fish and game to the Duke of Beaufort. It was accurate to observe this is not a great Australian attack and that the pitch at The Gabba was playing quietly. But it is more accurate simply to reflect that England began their second innings 221 behind, with more than two days remaining, that after only three days their reputation was on the line and by the end of the day they had responded so magnificently that they had summoned memories of giants from the past. History will tell you that this was one of England's great Ashes days. So Australia beware. Yesterday, four of England's finest lined up against Bradman. Six, if you include Strauss and Cook. Eight, if you include Michael Atherton and Graham Gooch, who racked up England's last Ashes century-opening stand against Australia in Adelaide in 1991. Eight v Bradman? That'll be right, mate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
