It is understood that staff at the titles, of whom about 500 to 600 work in editorial, were told of the plans earlier this week. News Group Newspapers (NGN), a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK, which publishes the titles, has initially called for voluntary redundancies in an effort to hit savings targets as part of a wide-ranging review of all parts of the editorial and commercial sides of the business. Staff have been told, however, that compulsory redundancies will follow if the targets cannot be met. A News UK spokesperson said: \u201cNews UK is in the process of reviewing all areas of its businesses to ensure we are maximising resources and to enable future revenue growth. \u201cAs part of this process, we need to reduce complexity and review all of our costs so that we can focus our investment on delivering high-quality editorial content to existing and new audiences. \u201cStaff at the Sun have been invited to apply for voluntary redundancy. We cannot comment any further at the current time.\u201d There is not thought to be a specific headcount target in mind, but indications of the scale of the savings sought mean the number of redundancies is likely to be large. One source said about a quarter of the cuts are expected to come from the Sun\u2019s online operation. The news comes months after NGN reported a tripling of pre-tax losses to \u00a391.2m in its most recent financial results, for the year to 1 July 2018. Total revenue fell from \u00a3424m to \u00a3401m as sales dropped 8% and 9% respectively for its daily and Sunday papers. News UK\u2019s move comes as the newspaper industry faces up to another tough year, with readers and advertisers continuing to drain away to digital media, the lion\u2019s share being taken by Google and Facebook. Group M, the global media division of WPP, predicts that the national newspaper ad market will fall 2.2% this year to \u00a3807m, a significant improvement on the falls of 5% to 11% recorded between 2015 and 2018. Mail Online, which is owned by the parent company of the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and Metro, reported a strong recovery in ad revenues for the first half of the year last week. Revenues were up 25% year on year, compared with 2% in the first half last year, thanks to an algorithm change by Facebook hammering reader numbers \u2013 more than making up for declines at the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
