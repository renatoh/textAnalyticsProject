But when they and the T20 runners-up, Yorkshire, go to South Africa next month, in search of success in the Champions League Twenty20, it will be in the knowledge that this opportunity may never again be available to county cricketers. The Champions League, which carries a top prize of \u00a31.58m and also provides talented young English players \u2013 such as Hampshire's Chris Wood, James Vince and Danny Briggs \u2013 with invaluable experience of the format, will take place in early September next year. And counties have already voted against starting next season on 3 April in order to make room for it. Hampshire's chairman, Rod Bransgrove, breaking off from his club's dressing room celebrations on Saturday evening, said: \"It was a majority vote taken by the county chairman. I wasn't actually at that meeting but it was quite a large majority. I'm part of a group that has made that decision, so regardless of my views we accept it and move on. It's a shame that we won't have English teams in next year. But I do understand that there's a huge fixture problem in this country trying to accommodate all of the cricket we play. It's a tough ask trying to fit it into one year.\" But although he accepts the decision, Bransgrove regrets that some of England's most talented players will not be exposed to the Champions League after this year. \"It's a huge stage,\" he said. \"It's the sort of competition that English clubs now aspire to because we can test ourselves against the best club sides in the world. We think we are quite good at this short-form cricket, particularly Twenty20. We have got a really strong squad and we think we can go there and just see how we match on a worldwide basis. I think we have come a long way. We have got young players who are already quite mature in one-day cricket. Some of them are playing in their third or fourth final at the age of 22, which is remarkable really.\" The 50th of these end-of-season cup finals gave Hampshire the first double since Sussex won the championship and Cheltenham and Gloucester Trophy in 2006. It was a slow-burn thriller, worthy of comparison with the most memorable of these finals, mostly in the 70s and 80s. It was a particularly painful result for Ian Bell who, as an 11-year-old boy at Lord's, watched Warwickshire's astonishing NatWest Trophy victory over Sussex in 1993 and returned 17 years later to score a man-of-the-match-winning century against Somerset to win the first CB40 final. Hampshire had scored an impressive but not decisive 244 for five. While Bell was at the crease Warwickshire were marginal favourites, even though the asking rate rose slowly, so that they needed 52 from the last five overs. From the last ball of the 37th over he hit a full toss from David Griffiths to the backward square-leg boundary, where he was caught by Michael Carberry. Suddenly Warwickshire needed 27 from three overs with their best man gone. Bell said: \"I would have liked to have been there at the end but I just got a full toss and I timed it too well to an extent. Five yards to the left and we would have been on the way to winning the game.\" Warwickshire should have scored the seven needed from the last over but Neil Carter, playing his last innings for the club and having thumped the penultimate ball for four, was unable to get the required single from the last delivery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
