Mr George, who in his previous job at interactive TV and web producer Victoria Real was one of the architects of Big Brother's interactive services, will leave Flextech next month to pursue opportunities in Los Angeles. Mr Humphrey, currently an executive producer in Flextech's interactive team, will take over responsibility for running the department from Mr George immediately. He will report to Jon James, the Flextech director of commercial and operations. Interactive TV is becoming an increasingly important area and Mr Humphrey said he was keen to develop Flextech's participation TV, mobile content and broadband on demand services. Flextech has been developing interactive poker and fixed odds betting services to support pay-TV channel Challenge's casino entertainment programming, as well as a music video on demand service for Telewest's cable customers. Mr George was one of the co-founders of pioneering interactive TV and web producer Victoria Real more than 10 years ago. He was part of the Victoria Real management team that sold the Brighton-based firm to Endemol UK in 2000, and became involved in developing interactive services for Big Brother. Mr George left Endemol in 2004 and joined Flextech less than a year ago. l\u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
