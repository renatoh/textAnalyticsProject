The Yorkshire club has not forgotten the way Hart developed a crop of promising youngsters when he was on the coaching staff at Elland Road. Appropriately, it was Preston's unknown 20-year-old striker Pawel Abbott who scored the decisive goal. If Forest did not want their manager to head northwards it was not evident from their first-half performance; either that or Preston were determined to ensure there was no chance of Hart taking his leave of the City Ground following a typical free-flowing display from his young charges. Cohesive attacks and attempts on goal, of which there were plenty, came from the visitors in a one-sided first half. Michael Keane served notice that Darren Ward was in for a busy evening with a left-footed cross shot in the seventh minute before Lee Cartwright shot tamely at the Forest goalkeeper. Paul McKenna then went close himself with a goalbound shot that was deflected for a corner by John Thompson. Forest were finding McKenna difficult to contain but a more formidable source of danger lay in Abbott's aerial prowess. The Preston striker twice set up chances with headed knock downs that were wasted by David Healy before assuming the role of executioner in a Preston goal that had long been inevitable. McKenna floated a free kick into the Forest penalty area, Michael Jackson headed it onwards, and likewise Brian O'Neil for Abbott to score from close range. Forest were clearly missing young centre-back Michael Dawson, who had been rested. Perversely, though, while his replacement Wes Morgan had problems coping with high balls in defence, it was his header that came closest to restoring parity as Forest finally woke up. Forest squandered a fortuitous opportunity to equalise when Marlon Harewood, clearly offside by some distance, was allowed to collect Andy Reis's lofted pass. Fortunately for the Preston manager Craig Brown, whose arms were windmilling so vigorously at the potential injustice that he was at risk of taking off, the Forest striker took the ball too far to the right of Gould's goal and fired into its side-netting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
