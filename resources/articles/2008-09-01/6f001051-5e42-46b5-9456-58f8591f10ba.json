Did the press, and consequently the nation, really get the wrong end of the stick about poor Cherie? Should we believe her version of, say, her use of a conman to buy two flats in Bristol (she didn't), why she snubbed the Queen by remaining seated at some royal do (she'd just had a miscarriage), why they were f\u00eated in Sardinia by Silvio Berlusconi with champagne, fireworks, Viva Tony in mile-high roman candles, etc (they were only drumming up support for London's Olympic bid)? And, oh yes, she didn't kill Humphrey the Downing Street cat, either. Whether it's the savage abridgment or whether she really doesn't bad-mouth Gordon, Alastair, Fiona et al, who knows? Who cares? Her book is warm and frank and funny and makes you like her a lot. Job well done, Mrs B."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
