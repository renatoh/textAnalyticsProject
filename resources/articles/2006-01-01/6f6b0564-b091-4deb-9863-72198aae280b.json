Sales of the newspaper fell by more than 70,000 in December to 642,256, 10% lower than the figure for November. The Sunday Telegraph put on around 50,000 sales when it relaunched in November with a new look and two glossy magazines, taking its circulation over 700,000 for the first time in two years. But the latest figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations show sales of the paper fell by more than 2% year on year. Overall, sales of the quality Sunday papers were down by less than 2% compared with December 2004. But most titles struggled to hold on to their November circulations last month, with Christmas and New Year's Day both falling on a Sunday. The Sunday Telegraph's main rival, the Sunday Times, was down nearly 6% month on month at 1,313,258, while sales of the Independent on Sunday fell by nearly 3% on the November figure at 219,040. The Observer, which relaunched this month in its Berliner format, was one of the better performing Sunday papers, with a monthly fall of just 1.5% to 430,403. Both the main mid-market Sundays struggled in December, with the Mail on Sunday down 5% month on month at 2,215,765 and the Sunday Express falling by 7% to 809,041. The red-top Sundays proved more of a mixed bag, with the Sunday Mirror up by more than 6% month on month at 1,513,323 and the News of the World down 6% at 3,509,189. It was a good month for Trinity Mirror, with sales of the People up by nearly 2% on November's figure to 886,235. But Richard Desmond's Daily Star Sunday was down a disastrous 16% year on year at 382,231, 3.4% down on the November figure. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
