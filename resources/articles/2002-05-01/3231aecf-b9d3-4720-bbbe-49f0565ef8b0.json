Instead, he was at Leopardstown with another Classic on his mind, and the success of High Chaparral in the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial certainly left him with plenty to think about. High Chaparral was sent off at odds of 1-5 to beat four opponents in the race that has been the prep for the last two Derby winners, Sinndar and, 12 months ago, the marvellous Galileo. O'Brien had provided him with a pacemaker, Nostradamus, who was soon a long way clear, but they had closed him down by the home turn which the favourite met on the wrong leg. He struggled around rather inelegantly and Seamus Heffernan, his jockey, then had to ask a serious question and give him two cracks before High Chaparral grabbed the lead and ran on to beat In Time's Eye by a length. Even then, with the post in sight, the colt seemed to have half a mind to stop in front and his success was not stamped with the authority of a likely Derby winner. O'Brien seemed happy enough, though he is never one to criticise his horses in public. \"They went along smartly and gave a miler like Nostradamus eight lengths and more,\" he said. \"Seamus educated High Chaparral and this horse and Hawk Wing are still in the frame for Epsom along with Sorcerous, who will probably go to the Dante at York this week.\" Ladbrokes left High Chaparral's odds for the Derby unchanged at 9-4 joint-favourite with Hawk Wing, his stablemate. At first sight, the outcome on June 8 at Epsom seems obvious - another Derby for O'Brien, and it's only a matter of which horse - but in truth it is still far more than a one-trainer race. Hawk Wing, after all, is far from certain to see out the trip, while High Chaparral, on yesterday's evidence at least, may not come down the hill or, if he does, may forget to turn left at the bottom. The next horse in Ladbrokes' betting, at 8-1 with a run, is Bandari, the runaway winner of the Lingfield Derby Trial on Saturday, who is not even entered, and can only get in now at a cost of \u00a390,000. The next horse, Al Moulatham, is a 14-1 chance, and then it is 20-1 bar. One thing seems certain. There is something among the double-figure horses which represents astonishing each-way value. Its identity may become clear at York this week. The French 2,000 Guineas was one of the few European Group Ones to have eluded O'Brien before yesterday's renewal, but he added it to his collection thanks to Landseer's comprehensive two-length defeat of Medecis, with Bowman in third. Firebreak, who was fourth home under Frankie Dettori, was relegated to sixth by the stewards, who also banned the jockey for the first two days of next week's meeting at Goodwod. Shaanmer, the favourite, was promoted to fourth and is now expected to bypass the Derby. John Gosden won the French 1,000 Guineas withZenda, who made just about all the running under a well-judged ride by Richard Hughes, while Act One was an impressive winner of the Prix Lupin and will be one of the favourites for the French Derby at Chantilly in three weeks' time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
