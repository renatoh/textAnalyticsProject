MAKE IT STOP!! MAKE IT GO AWAY!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!! Yes, a long stretch and a fierce thrashing in the Tower for daring to criticise our national treasure probably awaits, but really, truly and in all honestly, the Fiver can take no more. It's become so tedious, in fact, that we even tried gulping down 29 cans of special brew in the hope of slipping into a month-long stupor and resurfacing when the whole sorry business had gone away. But having misjudged the strength [we'll try 30 next time], we awoke this afternoon to discover that they were still banging on about it. Take Joan Laporta, for example, the world-on-a-stick-promising Catalan opportunist. He's announced that he'll spend \u00a335m on David Beckham and another, as yet unnamed player [Martin Keown? Mr Em?], if he wins the club's elections this Sunday. \"I recommend him to come to Barcelona because he will be one of the leaders of the team,\" rapped Laporta to some reporter, aware that the Madrid Globetrotters are discussing a late bid. \"I think he will enjoy Barca more than Real Madrid, the project of Barca is better,\" he lied. \"I have heard that he is a very nice person and I hope to convince him that the move will be of interest to him.\" But it's not David Beckham he'll need to convince, according to London's London Evening Standard, rather Mrs Posh. Father Ted Becks told the paper that \"David has to talk to her about it and see what she says before he decides,\" confirming that while Dave wears the skirts, Posh wears the trousers. Opening a fresh can of worms, father Ted then managed to spill some beans. \"I can't believe the club is doing this to him... just because Fergie doesn't like him any more.\" Stop, Ted, we're welling up. \"It's terrible what is going on. Fergie hasn't spoken to David for months.\" Ted, pull yourself togethe... \"This is about one man trying to force him but I can tell you he won't be forced.\" We'd like to go on, really we would, but having run out of paragraphs, we haven't even got space to add that Barca defender Patrik Andersson today astutely claimed \"there are at least 20 players in the world who are better in Beckham's position.\" Which is a shame. * * * * * * * * * * * * I, CLAUDIO The Fiver's always stood by Claudio Caniggia, even in the dark, dark days. Like when his Dyson DC04-sized nostrils started vacuuming more than a minimum-wage cleaner at Sears Tower. Or when he followed up Appetite for Destruction with the bloated Use Your Illusion I and II albums. But woe betide anyone who's not as loyal as us - as Rangers manager Alex McLeish found out today. \"Alex McLeish misled me the whole season,\" Caniggia fumed as his Stig of the Dump hair thrashed wildly, nearly taking one of the Fiver's eyes out. \"I remember very well him telling me if we won the league he should have enough power to extend my stay for one more year. But he's shown himself to be soft - like Mickey Mouse. He is as lightweight as paper.\" But like the critics of Matrix Reloaded, Claudio wasn't finished with his insults there. \"Let's face it, Rangers only won the league because Celtic were so obsessed with winning the [Euro Vase],\" he whined, rubbing a sachet of sodium into McLeish's exposed wound. \"They arrived at the final game of the season completely shattered while we were well rested.\" And, as tears started to well in his eyes, Claudio then accused McLeish of wrecking his life by denying him the chance to play in the Big Cup. \"Alex McLeish has destroyed my last dream in football,\" he wept, wracking his brain for the most evil insult he could think of. \"If Alex McLeish keeps on like this the nearest he will get to a big club in Italy or Spain will be the airport.\" Does the trick for us. But, as we said, we're as loyal as they come. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"When I said that I would stop after two terms, it looked like there were blossoming years ahead for Fifa. But now, with the decline of the global economy, the Sars virus and the war in Iraq, everything has become more difficult. To leave now would be like refusing to face responsibilities\" - Full-time Fifa president and part-time superhero Sepp Blatter has no intention of stepping down any time soon. * * * * * * * * * * * * RUMOURS Chelsea pensioner Gianfranco Zola is set to turn down a money-spinning \u00a34m-a-season move to Middle East outfit Al Qatar in favour of having one last Big Cup crack. He'll drop \u00a33m in wages to follow his dream. Bottle-blonde Valencia keeper Santiago Canizares says he's seriously considering a \u00a310m move to Arsenal. \"I know Arsenal have made an offer and I am flattered by the interest,\" said the cologne juggling custodian. Rustu Recber probably won't be joining Arsene, however. \"Even if Joan Laporta is not elected president, I think I will transfer to Barcelona,\" said the Turkish slap fan. Leeds United fancy Sheffield United's free-scoring midfielder Michael Brown, and \u00a33.5m could be enough to clinch a deal, unless Everton, Middlesbrough or Charlton get their first. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Luton Town's designate chief executive John Gurney has revealed he has become a public hate figure for discontented fans frustrated at the club's troubles. After the sacking of manager Joe Kinnear and his assistant Mick Harford and suggesting the Hatters should merge with Franchise FC, Gurney admitted: \"I am receiving hourly death threats.\" The Fiver will sleep easier having learnt that Alan Shearer is confident he will be fit by the start of next season after breaking an ankle in April. \"I will be back in training with the rest of the lads on July 3, although the physiotherapists want me in a week earlier as a precaution to make sure there are no problems,\" he told Newcastle's Evening Chronicle. And Bryan Richardson, the former Coventry chairman, is set to return to football as the owner of cash-strapped Derby County. The deal is expected to be finalised at the beginning of next week. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO BBC1: Match of the Day Live: England v Slovakia (7.30pm) Yesterday we teased and titillated you with a titbit of a truly tremendous tale involving Bobby Robson, a wine bar and a faux Danish (actually Dutch) playboy. We promised to fill in the gaps, so to speak, today. Match of the Day Highlights (3.10am) Like a Barcelona presidential candidate, however, we make idle promises we have no intention of keeping. Not while the Trevor Francis stories keep flooding in. ITV1: World Football (3.30am) \"Some years ago a friend of mine worked for a well-known supermarket chain,\" begins Tony O'Brien.\"At least, not as shelf-stacker, mind; as manager.\" Sky Sports 1: Turkey v Macedonia, first half (7pm) \"The company sponsored a Leicester game and, as manager, my mate was guest of honour. Among the free pennants and other treats afforded was the chance to watch the match from the VIP seats, where his next door neighbour was none other than Trevor Francis. England v Slovakia (7.45pm) \"My mate reports Trev as being 'very nice', and at one stage during a lull in proceedings, pouring a cup of tea for them both. International football (10.15pm) Jim Watson once had a kickabout with Trevor. \"When I lived in the Midlands as a kid, I was playing football outside my house,\" says Jim, setting the scene. \"Our man Trevor and his family pulled up to visit some neighbours. Sky Sports 2: Republic of Ireland v Georgia (7pm) \"His toddler son started running round, crying because he needed the toilet. My sister went to his aid, and took him to our neighbours' house, whilst Trevor stayed and played with me - 'to return the favour'.\" It's an enchanting image all right. Eurosport: Argentina U-21 v Japan U-21 (7pm) \"I wish he hadn't bothered, with his first touch he thumped the ball over my head, and over the fence into another garden. I had to go and get it back. Euro 2004 football (10.15pm) \"In his defence it was a 99p petrol station job.\" We know the type, Jim. Radio 5 Live: Sport on Five (7pm) This story begs the following questions: Has anyone else ever taken a professional footballer's son to the toilet? TalkSport: Football First (7pm) Has anyone else ever had to retrieve a ball, kicked by a professional footballer, from a neighbour's garden? Newstalk 106 (www.newstalk106.ie): Off the Ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) Frankly, we can't get enough of Trevor Francis so keep them coming to the.boss@theguardian.com If you're very good and if our lawyers allow us, you'll be rewarded with playboy Bobby on Friday. Unless we forget, of course. We're very forgetful."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
