Website: thecricketersarms.com. First impressions: Overlooking an idyllic green and nestled within a charming village, it's hard to believe the Cricketers' Arms is just 15 minutes from Stansted Airport. The inn dates back to the 18th century and the customary snoozing dog and local banter contrast well with an understated and stylish interior. What are the rooms like? The 10 rooms were updated in February. They are individually designed with minimal fuss, light wicker furniture and floral fabrics. The superior room has a 'hawkeye' view of the cricket green - perfect for those borderline LBW decisions. The bed test: High, mighty and easy to get lost under the cosy white duvet. The bathroom: Spacious and luxurious with free-standing bath on chunky slate tiles and a mammoth shower. The restaurant: Guests can go a la carte in the Long Room or opt for the lighter gastro pub selection in the bar. We plumped for the former and dined on foie gras with celeriac followed by grilled halibut with a saffron shrimp chowder. Three-course dinner with wine costs around \u00a330pp. What is there to do nearby? If you're not en route to catch a flight, take a short drive and explore the narrow streets and colourful houses in the market town of Saffron Walden. Cambridge is just 30 minutes away; alternatively, take advantage of the rural setting and enjoy a local ale and the sound of leather on willow. How much a night? Rooms from \u00a375-\u00a3125 including continental breakfast. A full English is \u00a33 extra."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
