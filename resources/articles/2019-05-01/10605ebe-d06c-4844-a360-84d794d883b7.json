She can\u2019t. \u201cIt was silent,\u201d she recalls of the dressing room after England lost 3-0 to the eventual champions. \u201cPeople were crying, upset, gutted that we couldn\u2019t give the account of ourselves that we wanted. \u201cWe had had a positive Euros. I\u2019ve not watched it back, no. I feel we let ourselves down as players. That was the hardest part \u2013 we didn\u2019t give enough.\u201d It was the team\u2019s second consecutive exit from a major competition at the semi-final stage after a crushing extra-time freak own goal from Laura Bassett put Japan into the 2015 World Cup final at England\u2019s expense. \u201cI think everyone is still hurting from the two semi-finals we lost,\u201d Kirby says. \u201cWe want to make sure we get past that stage this time. Not focus too much on the hurt we experienced and still feel, but to use that as a motivation.\u201d It was after the 2015 World Cup that Kirby first got noticed in public. The Canada tournament had awakened a nation to women\u2019s football. Despite the time difference a staggering 2.4 million tuned in to watch the semi-final on BBC One while in the United States 2.3 million watched on Fox Sports 1 \u2013 a record for a game not featuring the USA. Kirby and the team returned with bronze to a heroes\u2019 welcome. Then she was spotted for the first time. \u201cIn my local Tesco,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the girl behind the counter; luckily I was buying healthy food. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more common,\u201d she says. Particularly in Reading, where she played before switching to Chelsea. \u201cA lot of people recognise me now, especially the younger generations, definitely. But it\u2019s not that common. It\u2019s quite nice that I can weave in and out sometimes without people saying anything.\u201d That could change dramatically this summer. Already the Lionesses\u2019 faces are everywhere. This is expected to be the most-watched Women\u2019s World Cup, with more than one million people expected to attend. Are the players prepared for the increased recognition? \u201cI just stay inside anyway! With my dogs,\u201d says Kirby. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a transition for all of us. We\u2019ve probably had it drip-fed in \u2013 it\u2019s not gone \u2018bang!\u2019 \u201cThe girls will be ready for it and we have to accept that\u2019s going to come if we want to achieve what we want to achieve and be world champions. We have to be ready for everything that\u2019s going to come with it. It\u2019s exciting times. We want to be the face of women\u2019s football, to encourage young girls to play. If I have to be recognised in the streets to encourage them I\u2019m happy to do that.\u201d Part of Kirby\u2019s rise has come through an array of personal sponsorship deals, Nike and Swarovski the most prominent. \u201cI never expected any of the things that are happening to me, if I\u2019m totally honest. I joined the international stage quite late, I didn\u2019t do many of the youth age groups, so to come into the senior team and to be offered a Nike deal \u2013 a very, very low Nike deal to start with but I was jumping up to bite the woman\u2019s hand off to sign the piece of paper. \u201cThe girls are now getting sent things. Look at boots \u2013 a few years ago the girls all had to buy their own boots; it wasn\u2019t a case of Nike dropping in boxes all the time. In that respect it\u2019s got so much bigger. We had a new pair of socks on our pegs today and it was: \u2018Look at these \u2013 they\u2019re amazing.\u2019 We\u2019re still so humbled and excited when people want to help us. That just shows the character in this group \u2013 that we still get excited by a pair of pretty socks.\u201d Each pair of socks or boots is a step closer to a more equal game. But Kirby is sure of one thing: only winning the World Cup will give them the leverage to demand more. \u201cUltimately we need to grow the women\u2019s game,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest issue, it always has been. Then you can talk about equal pay and everything else. Ultimately we are doing the same job as the men but I understand that we\u2019re not filling out stadiums. That makes it difficult to have that argument. As the women\u2019s game improves and progresses, then they\u2019re the conversations we can start to have. \u201cThe USA are in dispute at the moment but they\u2019re selling out arenas, they\u2019ve won the World Cup and have some of the best players in the world in their team. They\u2019re in a position to do that. \u201cWe need to win the World Cup to have a leg to stand on in those situations. But if we keep improving the game on and off the pitch, those arguments can start to creep in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
