The Brazilian edged out English duo Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard to win the 50th edition of France Football magazine's prestigious Ballon D'Or award at a gala ceremony in Paris tonight, Lampard finishing second and Gerrard third. Ronaldinho, named Fifa World Player of the Year last December, finished third in the running in 2004 behind winner Andriy Shevchenko of AC Milan and his Barcelona team-mate Deco. The 25-year-old becomes the fifth Barca player to pick up the award, which is voted for by European football journalists, since Blackpool's Stanley Matthews won the inaugural Ballon D'Or in 1956. Luis Suarez was the first Barca player to achieve the feat in 1960 before Johan Cruyff picked up back-to-back awards in 1973 and 1974. Hristo Stoichkov was the next Barca star to win the title in 1994 and Ronaldinho's compatriot Rivaldo also claimed the honour in 1999 - four years after it was opened up to non-European players."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
