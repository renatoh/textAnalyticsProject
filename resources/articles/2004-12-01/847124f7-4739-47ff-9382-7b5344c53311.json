The first will be the heat from an enormous inglenook fireplace; the second the very agreeable aroma of the huge cheeseboard. The Great House overlooks the Market Square, a quintessentially English scene in which the only signs of the modern world are cars. Inside all is French; owner/chef R\u00e9gis Cr\u00e9py and wife Martine have made this restaurant-with-rooms Gallic since 1985. Floors creak comfortably with age, cosy rooms are decorated with a home-from-home selection of antiques, old books and beds. Stay in Room 3 and, in the unlikely event of fire overpowering the inn, you'll be fine - in true eccentric style a fire escape is situated right by the bed. \u00b7 01787 247431, The Great House, Doubles from \u00a376 per night, B&amp;B. Byfords, Holt, Norfolk It's got it all, has Byfords in the market town of Holt. Enterprising Iain Wilson and family lovingly run this Grade II-listed building as a restaurant, delicatessen, cafe and self-styled \"posh B&amp;B\". Rooms live up to their billing and offer a great mix of leather chairs, oak floorboards, original flint walls and Bang &amp; Olufsen TVs and DVD players. Walls are hung with images of Norfolk. The cafe menu (roast vegetable salads and \"posh\" cheese on toast) is chalked up daily above a log fire that banishes all thoughts of the wind whistling through the Fens outside. \u00b701263 711400, Byfords, Doubles from \u00a370 per night, B&amp;B. Peacock Suite, Portmeirion Hotel, Portmeirion, Wales This whimsical Italianate town on the Snowdonia coast comes into its own during winter months when there are fewer visitors and the long sandy beach is practically deserted. The Grade II-listed Portmeirion Hotel dates from 1850 and sits on the harbour edge. Edward VIII stayed in the Peacock Suite and its madly over-the-top four-poster bed is suitably regal. Ask in advance and staff will make sure the room is warmed by the real fire. \u00b701766 770000, Portmeirion Hotel, Three nights for the price of two until March 17 2005 (not including Christmas or New Year). Doubles from \u00a3135, room only. Peacock Suite from \u00a3240. The Leathes Head, Borrowdale, Cumbria Popular with walkers and climbers wanting to return to roaring log fires and hearty meals (Ullswater lamb with Cumberland sausage, roast apricots in spiced syrup and a daily vegetarian selection). You can even order a smart packed lunch for your wanderings. Great for families, and for city types wanting a change of pace. Afternoon tea is taken seriously here, as is bird-and squirrel-watching - if you're lucky, you'll see an indigenous red attacking the feeder in the garden. Expect comfort rather than designer style in bedrooms with patterned carpets and chintzy curtains. \u00b7017687 77247, The Leathes Head, From \u00a369.95pp per night, dinner, B&amp;B. No 1 Silverbank, nr Coniston, Cumbria Stylish holiday cottages are hard to find, but new bed on the block No 1 Silverbank combines contemporary luxury with cosy styling and a breathtaking location on the side of a mountain, within a five-minute walk of the Lakeland village of Coniston. Bedrooms are kitted out with wooden sleigh beds and Shaker-style furniture; one has stable doors leading to the garden and a roll-top bath. Centre of the action is a huge beamed sitting room with log fire - just help yourself from the cottage's log store. \u00b7020-7704 9071, No 1 Silverbank, Three nights from \u00a3350 self-catering; sleeps five/six. The Lamb Inn, Burford, Oxfordshire Situated in the heart of the ever-popular Cotswolds, this 500-year-old inn has recently been refurbished to make it even cosier now the nights have drawn in. A new Fireside Menu includes warmers such as braised ox cheek with parsley mash, and banana tarte tatin; rooms feature antique beds and all overlook a courtyard or quiet side street. The lounge, with its open fires, is popular with locals - or slip away with a Lamb Inn package to nearby Bliss day spa, Stow on the Wold, to get your circulation going with a salt scrub and massage. \u00b701993 823155, The Lamb Inn, Doubles from \u00a3130 per night, B&amp;B. Tor Cottage, Chillaton, Devon A real hidden gem - Tor Cottage is located up a private bramble-strewn bridlepath marked \"No Access\". There are five bedrooms, each with a log fire, private terrace and views over the owner's 18 acres of untouched hillside - call up a picnic platter and spend the night badger watching. It's enough to make you give it all up to recreate something similar, though few run such a successful enterprise - Tor Cottage has won everything going, including a Gold in the England in Excellence awards and was Les Routiers B&amp;B of 2004. Nearby Tavistock is getting something of a name as a gourmet town; check out the award-winning Creber's delicatessen, Country Cheese shop and the Horn of Plenty restaurant just outside town. \u00b701822 860248,Tor Cottage, Doubles from \u00a3130, B&amp;B. Feversham Arms Hotel, Helmsley, N Yorkshire Set in a picture-postcard North Yorkshire town full of dinky delicatessens and shops selling covetable souvenirs. Despite this, many never leave their room at the Feversham Arms Hotel, cosying up instead with Bang &amp; Olufsen TVs and DVD players, Molton Brown toiletries and Egyptian cotton sheets. There are 17 suites; number 15 is the largest and has a roll-top bath and gas-flame fire. Simon Rhatigan, formerly of Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons and Seaham Hall, says you'll know you're in Yorkshire when you read the menu; though you might prefer to stay in with the Do Not Disturb room service menu that includes a selection of fruit with warm chocolate dipping sauce. Hot stuff. \u00b701439 770766, Feversham Arms Hotel, Doubles from \u00a3120,B&amp;B. The Old Railway Station, Petworth, West Sussex This is the ultimate trainspotter's thrill-turned-B&amp;B, which perhaps could only be found in Britain. As its name suggests, it was once Petworth station. Built in 1894, rooms are decorated in period style with brass beds, washstands and potted plants. A former Pullman Carriage is furnished like a luxury train compartment, breakfast leaves near platform one in the former waiting room and is served by waitresses in rail steward-style uniforms. Pretty and wacky (or pretty wacky), don't miss the brief encounter with afternoon tea, cakes and cucumber sandwiches by the fire. \u00b701798 342346,The Old Railway Station, Doubles from \u00a362, B&amp;B. Jeake's House Hotel, Rye, East Sussex Just like Rye itself, Jeake's House Hotel is unashamedly old-fashioned. The parlour (nothing so vulgar as a \"lounge\") features a piano and fireplace jealously guarded by Yum Yum and Monte, the resident Tonkinese (mere Pekinese are so common). If you go out for a drink or two, beware - floors here are uneven with age and you might end up tipping into your brass bed or even falling down the narrow stairs. Charming, slightly eccentric and very welcoming - don't miss the excellent kippers and devilled kidneys at breakfast. \u00b701797 222828, Jeake's House Hotel, Doubles from \u00a378 B&amp;B."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
