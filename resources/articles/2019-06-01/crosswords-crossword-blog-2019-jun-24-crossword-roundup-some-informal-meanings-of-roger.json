I suspect more people would be able to give the more common version of that job title as clued by novelist-cum-setter Picaroon \u2026 6d Politician Brits execrate violently online (6,9) [ wordplay: anagram (\u201cviolently\u201d) of BRITSEXECRATE + abbrev. for railway (\u201conline\u201d considered as two words) ] [ BREXITSECRETA + RY ] [ definition: politician ] \u2026 that is, BREXIT SECRETARY, than could name Stephen Barclay (at time of writing). Here\u2019s a pleasingly misleading surface meaning from Dutch: 2d Boris perhaps oddly dour with number in government (7) [ wordplay: first &amp; third letters of (\u201coddly\u201d) DOUR + abbrev. for \u201cnumber\u201d, both inside (\u201cin\u201d) abbrev. for \u201cgovernment\u201d ] [ DU + N, both inside GOV ] [ definition: Boris, perhaps ] \u2026 en route to a tsar celebrated in song, Boris GODUNOV. Might the Times setter behind this clue \u2026 22ac He\u2019s after majority, damaging morale etc (9) [ wordplay: anagram of (\u201cdamaging\u201d) MORALEETC ] [ definition: he\u2019s after majority ] \u2026 for LATECOMER have likewise intended to suggest a more recent Boris? And in themed puzzles: no spoilers, but those who enjoy the quirkier end of language will definitely enjoy Raich\u2019s recent Independent on Sunday antics. Latter patter On the subject of misleading surfaces, here\u2019s Vlad: 11ac \u2018Roger Taylor is inside\u2019 (Queen fan) (8) [ wordplay: make an anagram of (\u201croger\u201d) TAYLOR, containing IS (\u201cis inside\u201d) ] [ ROYALT containing IS ] [ definition: Queen fan ] This clue for ROYALIST uses one of the slangier senses of Roger, which apparently comes directly from the literal meaning of the name (famous with a spear). Less lewdly, Roger is a policeman, a simpleton and a chatty way of saying \u201cOK\u201d. The last is of course from the decidedly less chatty context of radiotelephony, where it means \u201cI have received your last transmission satisfactorily,\u201d \u201cRoger\u201d denoting the R of \u201creceived\u201d. Solvers who enjoyed our guide to the phonetic alphabet will be thinking: isn\u2019t R \u201cRomeo\u201d? Well, it is, but it was Roger before that, and here\u2019s the Nato edict tacitly acknowledging that it would have been madness to try and switch such a commonly understood procedure word. And here\u2019s the Combined Communications-Electronics Board definition of a related word \u2026 I have received your message, I understand it and I will comply with it (only used by the addressee). Since the meaning of ROGER is included in that of WILCO the two prowords are not used together \u2026 which should perhaps end \u201cshould not be used together\u201d, since informally they so often are. Reader, how would you clue WILCO? Cluing competition Many thanks for your clues for SQUIFFY. The audacity award of course goes to Wellywearer2 for\u2026 There\u2019s really no need to be sniffy Though this clue is decidedly iffy You need to have thunk \u2019Bout a word that means drunk Or tipsy or kaylied or _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (7) \u2026 though Tomrollock is audacious in a different way with \u201cJohnson, standing indecorously to take question for time\u2019s tight\u201d, which reminds us that we got the word from prime-ministerial nicknames, as does Lizard\u2019s \u201cThere\u2019s question against bit of satire \u2013 dodgy and awry\u201d. The runners-up are Schroduck\u2019s \u201cAfter half of fruit cordial, get sick \u2013 but not this?\u201d and PeterMooreFuller\u2019s \u201cRidiculous quiff you\u2019re keeping well-oiled\u201d; the winner is Peshwari\u2019s \u201cStrange \u2013 after squad\u2019s cut by half, it\u2019s half-cut\u201d. Kludos to Peshwari; please leave entries for this fortnight\u2019s competition and your picks from the broadsheet cryptics below. Clue of the Fortnight The annotated solution is now available for Philistine\u2019s prize puzzle. I suspect that most solvers will have needed some crossing letters as well as this clue \u2026 16d Primarily hooked on gin, his work included (7) [ wordplay: first letters of (\u201cprimarily\u201d) HOOKED ON GIN HIS, containing (included) synonym for \u201cwork\u201d ] [ HOGH containing ART ] [ definition: same as the wordplay! ] \u2026 for HOGARTH, but so it goes for deft all-in-one phrases like this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
