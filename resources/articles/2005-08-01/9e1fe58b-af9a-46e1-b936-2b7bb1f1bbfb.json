He will lead an unrivalled and dedicated business team,\" he added. The deal to hire the former Financial Times news editor is understood to have been brokered by the Telegraph Group chief executive, Murdoch Maclennan, who has acted quickly to replace Collins. Lewis has been business editor of the Sunday Times for nearly three years and before that he was at the Financial Times for eight-and-a-half years. \"I'm very excited about joining the Telegraph although I am sad to be leaving the Sunday Times,\" he said. \"Business is one of Martin Newland's three pillars and some exciting months lie ahead.\" Mr Newland is expected to relaunch the business section this autumn. He has called the paper's news, sports and business sections its \"three pillars\". Collins announced his decision to quit the Telegraph last week after 19 years with the paper. He is to write a twice-weekly column for the London Evening Standard. Bookmakers Cantor Index had ranked Lewis a 10-1 outsider for the post behind Robert Peston, the City editor of the Sunday Telegraph, deputy City editor Kate Rankine and economics editor, George Trefgarne. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
