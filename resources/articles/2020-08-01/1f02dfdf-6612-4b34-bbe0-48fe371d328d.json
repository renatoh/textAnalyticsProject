The midfielder\u2019s deflected strike against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid with two minutes left on the clock earned his side a last-four date with PSG. It was Adams\u2019s second appearance in the competition, having missed most of the first half of the season because of injury, but he made up for lost time with a vicious shot from 20 yards that defeated Jan Oblak after the ball struck Stefan Savic on its way towards goal. \u201cIt\u2019s a deflection but it counts the same as a regular one,\u201d Adams told BT Sport. \u201cWe prepared the best way possible for this game but it was a bit odd, obviously, having no fans in on a Champions League night but also coming off a three-week holiday and having to prepare for such a big game being a first game.\u201d There will not be much time to prepare for the club\u2019s first Champions League semi-final, with PSG awaiting on Tuesday, after their dramatic win over Atalanta on Wednesday. \u201cFacing such a world class team like PSG, we\u2019re excited to show what we\u2019re capable of. We\u2019re really, really excited. We know Paris are a great team, we saw what they did against Atalanta. \u201cNow it\u2019s about recovering in the right way, getting ourselves right mentally and working on the game plan. We\u2019re confident in ourselves, you saw that.\u201d Leipzig\u2019s manager, Julian Nagelsmann, will need to put together a plan to stop Neymar and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 but will take great spirit from keeping Atl\u00e9tico relatively quiet. \u201cIt was a good game. Atletico defended like in all games - very good. At the end we were better in the final third. We did not create many chances, but they didn\u2019t create many chances,\u201d Nagelsmann told BT Sport. \u201cGreat emotions for the club and our team. As a manager you have to look forward. We have to prepare for the next game. There\u2019s not a lot of time to celebrate but maybe we will have a beer in the hotel then we focus on PSG.\u201d RB Leipzig were founded in 2009, so it is an impressive feat to reach the final four. \u201dThe club develops very fast since,\u201d Nagelsmann said. \u201cWe reached the Bundesliga and qualified for the Champions League three times. We\u2019re still in the Champions League. The progress is faster than usual.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
