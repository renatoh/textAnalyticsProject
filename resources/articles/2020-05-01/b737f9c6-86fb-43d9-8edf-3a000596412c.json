Though their symptoms varied, all the accounts from these people who have recovered from coronavirus echo the same sentiment: recovery came at a price. Weeks after getting better, strangers and loved ones still scrabble to create distance, afraid of contagion. At the time of writing, 5,984 Australians had recovered from the 6,875 confirmed cases. While the emerging consensus is that recovery induces, at least, short-term immunity, the World Health Organization urges caution, and researchers and health authorities are racing to determine how long this defence lasts. Here, six Australians talk about life after recovery. Kieran Ryan, 32: \u2018I asked my friends if they\u2019d carry my coffin\u2019 Keiran Ryan had just run a 42km marathon in Los Angeles and felt amazing. But a week after his return to Halls Gap in regional Victoria, Ryan was in bed, shaking himself to sleep. His suspicions were confirmed in a phone call from the state\u2019s Department of Health, which informed him his swab had returned positive. Breaking the news to his parents, a notable pause from his mother made him realise it would be a stress they\u2019d share. \u201cIt was the first time I ever thought of my mortality,\u201d he says. \u201cI definitely put a brave face on \u2013 and I know it\u2019s not the right thing to do.\u201d At his worst mentally and physically, Ryan prepared end-of-life arrangements and organised a will to avoid burdening his parents. \u201cI called a group of friends and asked if they\u2019d carry my coffin,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018This thing people are so frightened of, this thing has the ability to kill me.\u2019\u201d Looking for relief, Ryan searched online for people recounting their experience of milder cases but what he found at the time was grim. \u201cIt would have felt amazing to turn on the TV and hear from someone I could associate with,\u201d he says. \u201cI understand it\u2019s horrific but it\u2019s important to give hope.\u201d For Ryan, the toughest time came at night. When supportive friends and family slept, he was plagued by questions that began with \u201cwhat if\u201d. He relentlessly searched for signs of improvement and was overwhelmed by what he saw online. Recognising the damaging effect it was having on his mental health, he found himself switching off his phone. Now, three weeks after his recovery, Ryan still zigzags between anxiety and graciousness when he leaves the house. \u201cI have an irrational fear that someone would refuse to serve me or there would be an embarrassing moment where you\u2019re made to feel unwelcome,\u201d he says, adding that he already feels isolated after recovering alone on his property. \u201cI was almost walking around feeling like, what if someone knows?\u201d Despite the lingering dread, Ryan is most thankful for the check-ins from his friends and family: \u201cConnection is something you almost crave. The phone calls, the texts, being tagged in things \u2013 they lift your mood up.\u201d As for what he will take from the experience, Ryan says: \u201cIt\u2019s given me clarity on the things that are important to me \u2026 I certainly say I love you a lot more.\u201d Sean Sweetser, 50: \u2018It felt biblical, I felt like a leper\u2019 After contracting the virus following a holiday in Manila, Sean Sweetser felt a strange kind of irreverence when he went out into the world. Leaving his bedroom for the first time in weeks, he smiled and waved at a gardening neighbour as he walked by \u2013 a gesture he says is out of character. She stared back blankly. At the grocery store the other shoppers were, he says, \u201cin a different world to me \u2013 they were nervous, I was on a high\u201d. He felt \u201cuntouchable\u201d. For Sweetser, who lives in a share house with his 18-year-old son and a roommate, isolating in his bedroom was easy enough. He plugged a throwaway kettle into his en suite, had an assortment of disinfectants on hand and kept himself entertained with streaming services. He worked sporadically as an engineer. At the height of his symptoms, he stayed in bed. After some concern about how he and his son would be fed, the problem was solved by Sikh Volunteers Australia who dropped off hot meals. Logistically, most things were there: except empathy. \u201cThere was no compassion for me or the fact I might die, just themselves,\u201d he says of his son and roommate, who entertained conspiracy theories about the virus. Even after an honest conversation about their hostility, little changed, Sweetser recounts. \u201cIt felt biblical, I felt like a leper,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the hardest part \u2013 being ostracised in your own home.\u201d Sweetser was cautious and managed to recover without infecting either housemate. But when his son left the air conditioning running for too long \u2013 a pet peeve of Sweetser \u2013 he jokingly threatened to touch the remote without a glove. As a regular blood donor in the past, Sweetser has been hoping researchers will ask him to be a part of a trial or make a blood donation. Instead, the question he does get often is if he will write a science fiction book on a deadly virus, having already published a few e-books in the genre. His answer is firm no: \u201cIt\u2019s boring. I like an enemy you can see \u2026 I prefer something like robots.\u201d Karen Clements, 55: \u2018My immunity is now my superpower\u2019 On the first leg of her trip home from a holiday in the US, Karen Clements had just flown out of New York when the pilot announced that the city\u2019s airspace had gone into a rare shutdown. By the time she boarded her third flight, Clements was riddled with anxiety. Airports were empty and passengers were scarce. Sharing a plane with cruise patrons, she worried about contracting the virus \u2013 unaware she already had it herself. \u201cThe stress was worse than my symptoms,\u201d says Clements, who had discounted her migraines and nausea as side-effects from travelling. \u201cI got home, my legs buckled, and I had a massive anxiety attack.\u201d After calling for an ambulance, paramedics arrived in protective suits and, though she no longer showed signs of the virus, a cautionary swab returned positive. With the mild symptoms behind her, Clements grappled with disbelief. Even when her isolation time was up, she remained indoors for an extra two weeks. \u201cI just wanted to hibernate purely from the shock of knowing I had it,\u201d the 55-year-old life coach says. Once her own shock settled, Clements was met with the shock \u2013 and fear \u2013 of others. \u201cI was not contagious but [my stepson] said he didn\u2019t even want me in his suburb,\u201d Clements says. \u201cThe fact I had it was like I\u2019d still got it.\u201d Now, five weeks after recovery, the Melbourne local does her grocery shopping without a mask or gloves, citing her likely immunity as her \u201csuperpower\u201d. On one occasion, when a shopper asked her to take a step back, Clements assured her that she was among the safe few, having recovered. \u201cIf she could have shot up into the air, she would have,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll stop telling them though \u2013 I like the shock value.\u201d Camille Valvo, 64: \u2018You start acting normal\u2019 When Camille Valvo left her house for the first time after recovering from coronavirus she was feeling like a fugitive. In a matter of days, she lapsed in social distancing, handing a fallen coin to a stranger on the street. \u201cYou don\u2019t realise but you start acting normal,\u201d Valvo says. Recognising what she had done, Valvo walked back and apologised, assuring him it was OK because she was likely to be immune. After catching the virus from her daughter, a flight attendant, Valvo isolated at home with her husband: \u201cHe was asymptomatic but he could have had the virus. It\u2019s one of those things you won\u2019t know unless he gets a test.\u201d Hoping to connect with others experiencing moderate symptoms, Valvo joined \u201cSurvivor Corps\u201d, a private Facebook group where those recovering or recovered from Covid-19 could connect with each other and medical professionals. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t hearing about the mild cases enough,\u201d Valvo says. \u201cMaybe if they did they wouldn\u2019t be in freak-out mode.\u201d Still an active member of the Facebook group, and now recovered, Valvo is hoping to give this support back to others: \u201cWhen people post that they are on to \u2018day 44\u2019 [of recovering], I think, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m lucky.\u2019\u201d Sydney couple, 38 and 41: \u2018A blessing and a curse\u2019 Anna* and David* \u2013 and more than 40 others \u2013 caught the virus after attending a wedding in early March. The pair were among the first 80 cases in Australia; Anna was the first wedding guest to test positive. Despite the ceremony taking place before the introduction of restrictions, the guests received backlash about their attendance in comment threads under articles covering the outbreak. And the Sydney couple felt judged or feared by friends and acquaintances who avoided interactions. For these reasons they wish to remain anonymous. On her first walk after being cleared Anna wore a mask \u201cjust in case\u201d and questioned whether she had really recovered, wanting a negative swab to ease her mind. When the news made its way around their neighbourhood, the pair saw acquaintances blatantly avoid them on the street. Those who didn\u2019t know took visible steps back when they explained why they had disappeared. \u201cYou\u2019re made to feel like you\u2019ve done something wrong,\u201d says David, who describes it as a blessing and a curse to have had the virus so early. As small business owner, Anna also felt a pang of guilt when she realised she had infected a contractor who had helped her work overtime. Despite the flood of exhausting emotions, the couple feel strongly about doing what they can with their likely immunity. \u201cIf they want me on the frontline, I\u2019m happy to be there,\u201d Anna says. They have already taken part in few trials: one assessing at-home test kits, another looking at blood transfusion. David remains stumped by the response: \u201cThe fear of the unknown is understandable but science tell us we are probably the safest people.\u201d * Names have been changed"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
