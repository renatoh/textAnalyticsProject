The full effect on sport of the cuts, across a range of departments and local authority budgets, is difficult to ascertain but the Conservative sports minister, Hugh Robertson, admitted that community sport will take \"a major hit\" from the austerity measures being pursued by the Treasury. These will include: \u2022 A new generation of school sport facilities, that would have been provided at a total cost of \u00a36.05bn by the Building Schools for the Future programme, cancelled partway through by the education secretary, Michael Gove. \u2022 Huge cuts to the \u00a31bn local authorities spend on sport and recreation annually, all of which is discretionary spending. \u2022 A \u00a32bn cut to the total budget of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport by 2015. \u2022 \u00a365m lost due to the scrapping of free swimming for under\u201116s and over\u201160s, as well as the planned refurbishment of swimming pools that will not go ahead. When London won the Games in 2005 a legacy of increased participation was at the heart of the bid, with Lord Coe and the then Labour government promising that 2 million people would be inspired to take up sport as a result. Last night Labour's Andy Burnham, who as minister for culture, media and sport conceived the free swimming scheme in 2008 and secured funding from the departments of education, health, communities and local government, and work and pensions, accused the new government of \"lacking the courage\" to stick with the programme. \"The Olympics represent a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change the nation's habits and encourage more people to be physically active,\" he said. \"Yet with these cuts, some for peanuts in terms of government spending, we will see the hollowing out of sport as in the Conservative 1980s, and the Olympic legacy being thrown away.\" Robertson, the sports minister in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, insists he is committed to that legacy and currently working on a new plan for its delivery to be announced shortly. But he admits that the cuts to public spending, including 25% across departments the Treasury requires by 2015, will deeply affect community sport. \"This is a very difficult time and sport will take a major hit across the country,\" Robertson said this week. \"Everything is overshadowed by the state of the economy and the budget deficit we inherited. I am doing everything in my power to mitigate it, and protect sport funding.\" Last month, Robertson's Department for Culture, Media and Sport and four other departments scrapped their \u00a35m commitment each which enabled under\u201116s and over\u201160s to go swimming for free, the previous Labour government's flagship legacy programme. An associated \u00a325m programme to refurbish public swimming pools was also scrapped. Robertson is fighting to retain his department's own funding for sport, despite the impending 25% cut to its overall budget, and he is working to ensure that the drop in Treasury funding is compensated by a change to the distribution of lottery money, expected to bring an additional \u00a350m a year to sport from 2012. The major threat to community sport comes not from cuts by Robertson's department, but wider government cuts, particularly to local authorities. They run and subsidise most public sports facilities and many development programmes, although they are not legally required to do so. Community and school sport were increasingly better resourced under Labour, and beginning to attract funding from other departments as the physical and mental benefits of physical activity have become more widely recognised. However, councils have now been told to save \u00a31.2bn in total this year, and 25% savings to their overall budgets by 2015, and sport, as a non-compulsory service, is vulnerable. The Building Schools for the Future programme, cancelled by Gove last week, was going to provide new, modern sports facilities in 700 schools, many of which would have been open for general community use in the evenings and at weekends. While accepting that community sport will be hit by the cuts, Robertson argues that a refocusing of efforts can make resources work more effectively to create an Olympic legacy of increased participation, and he hopes to attract money from sponsors. \"I am doing what I can to ensure there is a legacy based on improving facilities, coaching and volunteers, and engaging people to take up sport,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
