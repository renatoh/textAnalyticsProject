The incident occurred while Harris, 73, was out walking. Harris has walked five miles a day since being diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2007. He said it has given him a level of fitness that he is \u201cconvinced helped save my life\u201d after suffering the aortic rupture. The DJ and former Old Grey Whistle Test host, known to fans as \u201cWhispering\u201d Bob Harris, described the moment as \u201cincredibly scary\u201d and thanked the ambulance crew and staff at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford. \u201cThe aorta is basically the M1 of the body and any damage is regarded as extremely serious,\u201d he said in a statement. Lewis Carnie, head of Radio 2, said that everyone at the station wished Harris a \u201cvery speedy recovery\u201d. A date has not been set for his return, but Harris said he was \u201con the road to recovery\u201d and hoped to be back at work \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Paul Sexton will stand in for Harris on 13 and 20 June, with further replacement presenters to be announced. Harris has presented The Country Show since 1998, when he took over from David Allan. In 2011, he was made an OBE for services to music broadcasting. He recently appeared as himself in the film Wild Rose, about a hopeful young country singer from Glasgow. Appearing on BBC Breakfast in April, Harris said he continued to undergo \u201cquite invasive treatment\u201d to keep his cancer at bay. He said he had no intention of stopping his work at Radio 2 not as host of music discovery platform Under the Apple Tree. \u201cThe last thing I want to do is put my feet up and stop,\u201d he said. \u201cI think once you do that it\u2019s the beginning of the end. I\u2019ve got no intention of thinking that way at all.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
