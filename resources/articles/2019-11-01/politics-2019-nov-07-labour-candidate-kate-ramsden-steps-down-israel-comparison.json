Kate Ramsden, who had been standing for Gordon, in Aberdeenshire, withdrew for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d after Labour asked her to re-interview and said she could face a disciplinary process. In the blogpost, reported by the Jewish Chronicle, she said: \u201cTo me, the Israeli state is like an abused child who becomes an abusive adult.\u201d The report said she added: \u201cLike child abuse, it has to stop \u2026 As we intervene with child abusers, the international community needs to intervene with Israel.\u201d Labour said the party had uncovered the blogpost and then asked her to re-interview, but the details emerged in the Jewish Chronicle before she was reassessed. Ramsden then said she was standing down as a candidate of her own accord. A Labour source said: \u201cWe took immediate action to have Kate Ramsden\u2019s candidacy reconsidered in light of the material that we found. Staff in Labour HQ found these posts when conducting extra due diligence checks. \u201cStaff immediately alerted Scottish Labour, who informed the Scottish executive committee, which decided to reinterview Kate Ramsden about the new posts that had been found. Kate Ramsden stood down as a candidate and is therefore not a Labour candidate in the election. The party took swift and robust action on this matter.\u201d Another Labour candidate, Zarah Sultana, was the subject of controversy after she accused the party\u2019s right of \u201cweaponising\u201d complaints of antisemitism against the leadership. The candidate for Coventry South had previously been forced to apologise for saying she would celebrate the deaths of Tony Blair and Benjamin Netanyahu. A third candidate, Jane Aitchison, who is standing in Pudsey, West Yorkshire, was criticised by the Tories over her reaction to Sultana\u2019s comments. Interviewed by BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett, Aitchison said she thought \u201csometimes people say things and they\u2019re very passionate and they say things that are wrong\u201d. But she then added: \u201cPeople do celebrate deaths sometimes \u2026 For instance, people celebrated the death of Hitler.\u201d Andrew Percy, vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group against antisemitism, said: \u201cComparing Israeli leaders with Adolf Hitler, a man responsible for the death of 6 million Jews, is not only deeply upsetting to the Jewish community but also sick.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
