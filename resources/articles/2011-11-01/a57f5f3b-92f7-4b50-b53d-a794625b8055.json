She's got an ear for memorable phrasing \u2013 \"Hang him out to dry, they said/ No, let's hang him up to die instead,\" is the opening couplet of Ostrich Song \u2013 and a smoky, slightly nasal voice. But she never quite lets her music become as exuberant as it needs to be \u2013 for all that her voice and guitar are backed by trombone, tuba, tenor sax, trumpet, double bass and even kazoo, it's muted and sometimes solemn, without the breathtaking pizzazz Ana\u00efs Mitchell brought to similar styles on her Hadestown album. Still, it's a debut, and suggests a talent that will only grow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
