Despite making row after arm-aching row of sushi balls weighing exactly 20 grams, the wooden pail of rice is seemingly bottomless. Patience, combined with nimble fingers and a penchant for precision, are clearly the most useful ingredients when attempting to master the art of sushi making - as I'm learning the hard way. Since moving to Tokyo three months ago, I have eaten sushi every day. Well, it's hard not to. As well as local sushi counter restaurants on almost every street, a raft of high-end outlets elevate raw fish and rice to an art form. Best of all is the Tsukiji fish market. Having navigated the pre-dawn rush of market workers haggling loudly over an eclectic array of maritime creatures, the undisputed highlight is tucking into the freshest sushi in town at one of the low-key restaurants that cling to its fringes. The setting is usually little more than a room with a long counter, but the quality of the sushi is superb. Now I'm a resident, I felt the time had come to learn how to make sushi myself - primarily to impress visiting friends. Tokyo Sushi Academy is the only school in the country devoted to teaching the professional art of sushi making, training more than 100 chefs every year. But beginners' courses are also available. A towering tangle of green bamboo covers the facade of the main classroom in a quiet Tokyo sidestreet. Converted from a traditional basement sushi restaurant, the space has retained its long sushi bar, tatami mat flooring and kanji menu on wooden blocks hanging on the wall. But the action takes place in the vast white kitchen at the back. Here, apron in place, jewellery removed and hands scrubbed clean, I take my place around a long steel table. Our mission today is to create a platter of perfect nigiri sushi - mounds of rice with raw fish perched on the top. Fortunately, there are two sensei (teachers) dressed in whites, assisting half a dozen students, each of whom has been issued with a chopping board, bowl of tezu (vinegar and water), electric weighing scales and a pail of cooked rice. \"First of all, you must pick up in your right hand exactly 20 grams of rice,\" says the teacher. This proves tricky. My first two attempts are too heavy, the next three too light - until I eventually manage an acceptable 19 grams. Next, we are instructed to follow a very precise routine of movements - rolling, wedging, squeezing and turning - before laying the rice ball down on the wooden platter. When the rice is finally finished, maybe some 30 minutes later, the teachers smile at my efforts - then happily discard my carefully crafted balls. \"That was just practice,\" laughs one teacher. Next, intricate diagrams are drawn on a whiteboard showing the angle at which raw fish should be cut in two. Narrowly avoiding severing the tips of my fingers, I work through a pile of mackerel fillets,before being shown how to score the surface of a pile of chopped ika (squid). The next step is attaching the fish and squid to fresh rice with dab of wasabi (horseradish paste) - my heart sinks at the prospect of more rice ball making. But once more, a sense of rhythm takes over and eventually my wooden platter is filled with something that resembles sushi, completed with a garnish of grated ginger and onions. The piece de resistance is the shaped bamboo leaf which decorates the plate. While I am not able to master the sensei's ability to rustle up a bird in a single cut, I create an almost acceptable abstract pattern to adorn my platter. The ultimate test then arrives: we carry our platters down to the sushi bar. Cups of green tea and hashi (chopsticks) delegated, we tuck in. My mackerel cut may be wonky and the use of wasabi inconsistent, but it is tastier than it looks. In fact, it's really very tasty indeed. \u00b7 Tokyo Sushi Academy (0081 3 5319 1480, sushi.ne.jp) has three-hour private classes ranging from \u00a522,500pp (\u00a3101) for groups of eight people to \u00a540,000 for one person.
