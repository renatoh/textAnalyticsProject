It's a taster of his new show at the Stand, A Deadpan Poet Sings Quiet Songs Quietly. Next up is cuddly Glaswegian chef Hardeep Singh Kohli, who is cooking up fun every night at the Gilded Balloon for punters who bring their own ingredients. It's Hardeep's first time at the festival and he's bemused to be sharing a venue with the Chippendales. After a late night on the tiles playing poker with Lucy Porter and his other comedy pals, John Gordillo joins Miles to talk about the basics of Fuckonomics, as outlined in his show at the Pleasance. After all that, how about a bit of romance? Taking a break from serenading Jonathan Ross, 4 Poofs and a Piano have a tinkle with an X-rated ode to the importance of the third date. Bright young spark Jack Whitehall drops in to spread some love to John Gordillo and talk about his dad, beard envy and why he's already over the hill at 21. Finally, Idiots of Ants perform a short sketch for your listening pleasure. We're also giving you the opportunity to perform in front of our live, sold-out audience.
