This British premiere was a semi-staging, with a first-rate cast led by Maria Riccarda Wesseling as Phaedra, John Mark Ainsley as Hippolytus and Marlis Petersen as Aphrodite, with the peerless Ensemble Modern conducted by Michael Boder. But how much more theatrical content the work would reveal if it were fully staged is hard to tell. My suspicion is not much, for the dramatic problems of Henze's work are all too obvious. In librettist Christian Lehnert's retelling of the classical myth Phaedra, the wife of Theseus who falls in love with her stepson Hippolytus, only takes up half of the work. The second act takes the murdered Hippolytus's body to Italy, where it is raised from the dead and renamed by the goddess Artemis (sung by the counter-tenor Axel K\u00f6hler, curiously) and though he remains uncertain of his identity, Hippolytus is crowned King of the Forest. But Lehnert's treatment is self-consciously oblique, more commentary than narrative, and overflowing with contrived imagery. The raw, tragic core of the story is obscured by the verbal pretentiousness, and the dramatic pulse ebbs away early. It becomes a long 75 minutes, even though Henze's score, with its febrile vocal lines and translucent ensemble writing, which are illuminated intermittently by shafts of pungent lyricism, is often remarkable. Those moments provide a hint of what a powerful chamber opera this Phaedra might have been, given a less indulgent, more dramatically responsible text."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
