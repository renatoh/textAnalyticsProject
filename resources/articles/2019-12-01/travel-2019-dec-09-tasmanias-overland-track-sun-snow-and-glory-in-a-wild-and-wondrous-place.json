The trail from Cradle Valley to Lake St Clair takes hikers across alpine plateaus, where wildflowers peep out below snowdrifts, through moors dotted with buttongrass and grazing wombats, and into majestic myrtle beech rainforests. It\u2019s bucket-list beautiful. Palawa people have cared for this country for thousands of generations, since arriving during the last ice age. In this remote landscape, their resilience is thrown into sharp relief. While today\u2019s track won\u2019t challenge fit walkers, you can bet the weather will. Almost half the path is above 1,000 metres, and rain, snow, wind and sunshine can come any time of the year \u2026 or all within a single hour. Just three hours into my four-day hike, I find myself soaked, shivering and getting smashed by a hail-blasting gale that keeps knocking me off my feet, sending me crawling through knee-deep snow. In November. Half an hour ago our group of nine reached the trail\u2019s highest point, and on cue granite clouds parted to reveal Cradle Mountain\u2019s turrets towering over a slaty lake. But on a path circling the peak with Jill, a Tasmanian Walking Company guide who\u2019s hauling me up when I fall, the shrieking gusts seem to be sucking the air out of me. I stack it again. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to laugh, don\u2019t you?\u201d Jill says, holding out her hand. And just like that, I do. As the trip goes on, with our TWC guides merely joking that the hail was \u201ca bit rude\u201d, we learn from a ranger that winds of up to 100km/h have closed the trail to independent hikers. Two walkers were winched to safety. Also: just a week ago people were swimming in these lakes! Need to know: The track starts at Ronny Creek near Waldheim, a two-hour drive from Launceston airport. Some hikers take six days to reach Narcissus, then take the ferry across Lake St Clair. Others take an extra day or two to walk the length of Australia\u2019s deepest lake. From there it\u2019s a two-and-a-half-hour drive back to Launceston. There\u2019s a list of transport operators at overland.com.au. Most offer luggage storage. If you don\u2019t have enough time for the full track, it\u2019s possible to walk for three days to Pelion Plains then exit on the fourth day along the Arm River Track to Mersey Forest. You\u2019ll need to arrange for a shuttle to pick you up there. Self-guided hikers setting off between 1 October and 31 May must walk the trail from north to south and book in advance, paying $200 for adults and $160 concession. A parks pass is also required. For less experienced bushwalkers \u2013 and for those who can handle a little more luxury (hot showers, no tents!) \u2013 one of the private operators, TWC, offers four- and six-day hut hikes, with prices starting at $2,795 per person twin share, including meals, passes and transfers. The Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service offers a wealth of information that includes a packing guide and a checklist of the absolute minimum equipment needed. This includes sturdy footwear. On this point I felt confident. But on night one, after 11 hours struggling along slippery, snow-covered boardwalks, I confirm that the boots I bought seven years ago for two treks in Nepal have sprung leaks. (Veteran hikers will have spotted my mistake.) I place them by the fire to dry. (Ditto.) In the morning, as I\u2019m lacing up for another 12km slog, I discover that the soles have come away. Modern boots disintegrate after five years, I\u2019m told \u2013 and overheating mine has trashed them. But there\u2019s freedom in knowing feet can\u2019t get any wetter. Cable ties are applied and off we go. Flora and fauna: Look for bright green cushion plants \u2013 not one species but communities growing together to better battle the elements. But keep to the path: these mounds can take decades to recover from one footprint. Pencil and king billy pines live up to 1,200 years \u2013 if they can survive bushfires. They\u2019re descended from plants that grew on the single super-continent of Pangaea more than 300m years ago. We spot pademelons, wallabies, black cockatoos, wedge-tailed eagles, a pink robin, a peregrine falcon and the grass-green flash of a ground parrot. Our second guide, Ziah, is an encyclopedia of information about the wildlife, stressing that being in this wondrous place and accepting its gifts creates in us the obligation to look after it. Where to sleep: There are tent platforms and public huts at the end of each day\u2019s trek. Bunks are first come, first served. Hidden along the track are TWC\u2019s five cosy huts. They\u2019re designed to be ecologically sustainable, though private accommodation on public land remains anathema to staunch conservationists. Don\u2019t miss: Take a side trip to Old Pelion Hut, a 100-year-old miners\u2019 shelter, to read entries in its visitor book dating from the 1940s. One group of hikers describe arriving in 1960 to \u201ccontest tenancy rights with Possum who was well established in bottom right hand bunk. We won!\u201d When to go: January to March are the drier months, with longer days and less chance of snow. That said, it\u2019s the wild weather that really makes our trip. There are scores of spills but also thrills \u2013 when the sun comes out for whole seconds at a time, turning this wintry wonderland a dazzling white and revealing the moody yet magnificent mountains around us. \u2022 Guardian Australia was a guest of Tasmanian Walking Company and Tourism Tasmania"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
