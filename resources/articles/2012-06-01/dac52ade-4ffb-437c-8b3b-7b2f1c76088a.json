Yorkie bars are for real men who subscribe to 17 different lads' mags and didn't even cry during Watership Down. Milky Bars are for kids who will grow into yellow-haired nonagenarians. Flakes are largely eaten by moisteningly seductive femmes with a passion for Kierkegaard, Chopin and chocolate bars that double up as sex aids. Then there's the new Mars advert, which straddles the line between banter and its Hackett-wearing cousin, xenophobia. It involves a penalty shoot-out between England and Holland. England losing a penalty shoot-out at major tournaments is one of the first things on the curriculum, just after self-loathing and split infinitives. But it doesn't have to be this way! If we all eat enough rectangular slabs of migraine-compounder, England can win a penalty shoot-out! Not just that: you could be the man to win it for them. When England's keeper is injured, an everyman steward takes a bite of a Mars, considers his destiny and whips off his fluoresecent mac with an elan usually reserved for Superman and characters played by Kim Cattrall. In a blur of missed penalties, CGI and naff celebrations, England win. \"England has a new hero,\" screams the commentator. \"Extraordinary.\" Healthy eating? Yes, that might stop you turning into a fetid, coffin-bound lump by the age of 45, but how many penalty shoot-outs have you won for England? Loser.
