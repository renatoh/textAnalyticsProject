The Austrian writer, whose stance on the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s and attendance at Milosevic\u2019s funeral have been widely criticised, is due to receive his Nobel medal in Stockholm, where a large protest demonstration is expected. Bosnian Swedish writer Adnan Mahmutovic, who is organising the protests, said there had been a huge negative response to Handke\u2019s win in Sweden. \u201cWe hope that our voices tonight will help us start a dialogue about the consequences of continuous genocide denial that has been going on for decades. Genocide is not an event but a process whose last phase is denial. We cannot let our Nobel legacy legitimise it,\u201d he said. Last week Peter Englund, a member of the Swedish Academy, which selects the winner, announced he would boycott the ceremony, saying: \u201cTo celebrate Peter Handke\u2019s Nobel prize would be gross hypocrisy on my part\u201d. On Tuesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan slammed Handke on television, saying \u201cthe Nobel has no value \u2026 granting the Nobel literature prize on Human Rights Day to a figure who denies the genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina is nothing less than rewarding human rights violations.\u201d Turkey\u2019s ambassador to Sweden, Hakki Emre Yunt, also announced he would not attend the ceremony. Albania\u2019s acting foreign minister Gent Cakaj has instructed the country\u2019s ambassador to Sweden to boycott the ceremony, as is Kosovo, with its ambassador to the US, Vlora \u00c7itaku calling Handke\u2019s win \u201ca preposterous and shameful decision\u201d. Journalists who covered the war in Bosnia, meanwhile, are protesting Handke\u2019s win by describing what they saw during the conflict using the hashtag #BosniaWarJournalists. \u201cI was there. We all know who\u2019s guilty,\u201d wrote Amanpour, the chief international anchor for CNN who covered the war as a young reporter. \u201cMy colleagues #BosniaWarJournalists are outraged so we are posting our work to remind the world of what happened there. Never forget,\u201d wrote foreign correspondent Janine di Giovanni. \u201cIn Sarajevo, I\u2019d go to the morgue to count dead: Children, women, soldiers, horrors of that unjust war laid out on a slab. What BosniaWarReporters like me saw was relentless attacks on civilians. Genocide. Please speak out against Handke getting Nobel.\u201d The BBC\u2019s Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen wrote: \u201cI reported all the Yugo wars. Saw monstrous crimes. Later testified at war crimes trials, inc those of Bosnian Serb leaders Karadzic &amp; Mladic.\u201d Former foreign correspondent Emma Daly said that she \u201cwill never forget walking around the mass graves holding hundreds of men &amp; boys who were blindfolded, shot &amp; buried on farmland near Srebrenica. We know Milosevic was responsible.\u201d The New York Times\u2019s Roger Cohen, sharing a link to his 1994 story about a Serbian concentration camp, wrote: \u201cshame on Nobel Committee and Swedish King for handing Nobel literature prize to Peter Handke, who calls the Bosnian genocide myth\u201d. Journalist Peter Maass, who was told on Friday by Handke that his questions about the Srebrenica massacre were \u201cempty and ignorant\u201d, wrote on Twitter that the legacy of the Swedish royal family, who will award the Austrian author his medal, will be that \u201cthey authenticated a genocide denier\u201d. Handke has claimed that the Muslims staged their own massacres in Sarajevo and then blamed this on the Serbs, also casting doubt on the massacre of thousands of Muslims in Srebrenica in 1995. In an essay for the French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration in 2006, he wrote: \u201cLet\u2019s stop comparing Slobodan Milosevic to Hitler \u2026 and let\u2019s never again use the expression for the camps installed during the Yugoslav war \u2018concentration camps\u2019. \u201cTrue, there were intolerable camps between 1992 and 1995 in Yugoslavia, especially in Bosnia. But let us stop mechanically linking, in our heads, these camps to Bosnian Serbs \u2013 there were also Croatian camps and Muslim camps, and the crimes committed there, and there, are and will be tried in The Hague,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd finally, let\u2019s stop linking the massacres (amongst which, in the plural, those in Srebrenica in July 1995 were by far the most abominable) to Serbian forces or paramilitaries. Let us also listen to the survivors of Muslim massacres in the many Serbian villages around Srebrenica.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
