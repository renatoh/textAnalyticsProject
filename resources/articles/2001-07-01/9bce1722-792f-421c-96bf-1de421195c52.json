The western-backed plan is an attempt to reconcile the country's majority Macedonians, who are mostly Slavs by origin, and its minority ethnic Albanians, who bitterly complain of treatment as second-class citizens. Ahead of the talks, the EU's envoy to Macedonia, Fran\u00e7ois Leotard, and his American counterpart, James Pardew, attended negotiations hosted by Macedonia's president, Boris Trajkovski. The peace plan is broadly based on a proposal by the French constitutional expert Robert Badinter, with input from local and international experts. Mr Pardew said it was a \"comprehensive framework\". On the eve of today's talks, however, ethnic Albanian politicians - while not rejecting the draft outright - said the plan was flawed. \"We have serious objections to the proposed document,\" said Zehir Bekteshi, a spokesman for the ethnic Albanian Party for Democratic Prosperity. \"But this is only a draft version. It is not something final that could be immediately accepted or rejected.\" Meanwhile the country's defence minister, Vlado Buckovski, expressed concern over reports from the western Tetovo region, where ethnic Albanian militants are fighting a four-month insurgency. Reports claimed the Albanians were gaining ground and erecting barricades around villages under their control. However, a high-ranking rebel commander operating near Tetovo, Macedonia's second-largest city, said that Macedonian troops killed a rebel fighter in clashes there yesterday. The commander, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the army sent about 30 paramilitary troops dressed in civilian clothing to attack rebel positions near Tetovo. The claim could not immediately be independently confirmed. Also in the region, militants brandishing machine guns and uniforms with the UCK insignia - the acronym for the rebel National Liberation Army - today intercepted buses driving female textile workers out of Tetovo to a nearby factory. The guerrillas ordered the buses back from a roadblock they had set up outside the village of Jazince. \"These two days are going to be crucial for solving the crisis,\" Mr Buckovski said. There were no other incidents overnight, but Macedonian state television reported that seven people have been missing in the Tetovo region since last week, when a Nato-mediated ceasefire took effect.
