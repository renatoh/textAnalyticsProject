The Lib Dem leader's acceptance of a referendum as part of a future governing deal could be crucial to forming a coalition if neither the Conservatives nor Labour win an outright majority at the next general election in 2015. Clegg repeated his opposition to the proposal, outlined by Cameron on Wednesday, that a future Tory government would renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU and then hold a referendum on whether to stay or go. A poll for Friday's Times showed that if a referendum was held now 40% would vote in favour of leaving the EU, with 37% wanting to stay and 23% undecided. \"I simply don't understand the point of spending years and years tying yourself up in knots first, so called 'renegotiating' the terms of Britain's membership in ways that at the moment at least, are completely vague,\" Clegg said during his weekly phone-in programme on LBC radio. \"And I think that discourages investment and inhibits growth in jobs which has to remain our absolute priority at a time when the economy is still struggling to recover.\" However, when pressed on whether it would prevent the Lib Dems forming another coalition with the Conservatives after the 2015 election, Clegg appeared to suggest ways could be found to accept the referendum. Such a move has precedent in the last coalition agreement, where Tories supported a holding a referendum on alternative voting, but campaigned against the idea. \"I'll follow the instructions of the British people,\" said Clegg. \"If a coalition is necessary following the votes of the British people then we'll play our part.\" Asked by LBC presenter Nick Ferrari to confirm that he was saying the Lib Dem leader \"could work with him [Cameron] in a coalition\", Clegg added: \"I will always play a responsible role. I've done it in the past at some political cost and I'll do it again if necessary to provide this government, this country with good government in the national interest.\" Meanwhile, the German chancellor Angela Merkel followed up her cautious indication on Wednesday that she was open to a \"fair compromise\" by describing Cameron as a \"friend\" and offering further breathing space, telling the World Economic Forum in Davos that the eurozone's rules should be \"binding\" for themselves but \"freely accessible\" to other EU countries such as the UK. Later Cameron held an unscheduled meeting with Merkel, and spoke briefly with the prime ministers of the Netherlands, Italy, Ireland and Denmark \u2013 conversations which No 10 said the PM used as an opportunity to reassure his fellow European leaders that he was \"doing this [to] keep the UK in the EU\". No 10 said Merkel's willingness to discuss the upcoming EU summit, tense budget negotiations and the situation in Mali showed the UK was not being marginalised in Europe. On the Clegg comments, Lib Dem sources later stressed that any future coalition negotiations would depend on the results of the election, more detail about what powers Conservatives wanted to repatriate from the EU, and the \"situation\" in Europe at the time \u2013 a reference to the fact that a referendum will be triggered anyway if any new treaty to solve the eurozone crisis involves further powers moving from the UK to Brussels. \"We have no idea what it entails,\" said a senior source. \"The answer is we don't know how those things are going to affect the country and therefore the national interest, and that's what we're interested in.\" A No 10 source said the conversation with Merkel was mostly about the EU budget and Mali, but suggested the PM welcomed Merkel's interventions. \"We want people who are going to engage and work with us on this and we appreciate the fact Merkel said we obviously need to listen to their views and issues,\" said the source. The meeting with the other four PMs - the Dutch PM Mark Rutte, Mario Monti of Italy, Ireland's Enda Kenny, and Denmark's Helle Thorning-Schmidt \u2013 was \"in the margins\" said No 10, which also stressed they wanted to work with all EU leaders. \"It was a chance for him to say in person, having spoken to them on the phone in the last few days, to reiterate 'I'm doing this because I want to keep the UK in Europe and I'm hoping you'll work with me on this'.\" Cameron used his Davos speech to emphasise that negotiations over new terms could benefit all of Europe. \"It's not just right for the UK,\" he said from the platform. \"It's necessary for Europe.\" He added: \"Europe is being out-competed and out-invested, and it's time we make it an engine for growth, not a source of cost for business and complaint for our citizens.\" Billionaire philanthropist George Soros also waded into the debate over a possible EU referendum. Speaking over dinner on Thursday night at Davos, Soros said that Cameron was responding to pressure from his own backbenchers with \"a dangerous gambit which could actually lead to Britain leaving [the EU]\". He added that the UK is currently in \"the best of all possible positions,\" because it is a member of the EU, without being part of the crisis-hit single currency. Soros, whose hefty bets against the Bank of England notoriously helped drive sterling out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on what became known as Black Wednesday, believes the tensions underlying the euro may eventually pull the EU apart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
