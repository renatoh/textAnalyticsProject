The state of child protection services has again been questioned with the revelation that seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq allegedly starved to death in her Birmingham home. Climbi\u00e9's mother said recently she felt betrayed because local authorities had not learned any lessons from her daughter's death, and Laming told the BBC he didn't have full confidence in the ability of social services to protect children. But new research suggests that children's services are becoming more integrated, although there is still a long way to go. The Local Authority Research Consortium (Larc) - a coalition of 14 councils, the National Foundation for Educational Research, the Improvement and Development Agency and the Local Government Association - analysed children's services for looked-after children, those on the autistic spectrum, and persistent absentees at key stage 3. There is increased dialogue and closer cooperation between professionals working with children, the report found. Services are becoming more holistic, and families are finding it easier to access information. New processes for identifying young people's needs - such as common assessment frameworks, multi-agency panels, integrated referral systems and electronic data-sharing - are becoming more widely used. And more councils have integrated teams, school-based practitioners and an individual point of contact for parents. \"Greater integration is not an end in itself,\" John Harris, director of children, schools and families at Hertfordshire county council and chair of Larc, points out. The question is whether it helps improve outcomes for young people and makes them safer. Anonymous interviews with 200 children and families seems to suggest that it does make a difference. Young people say they feel safer, happier and more confident and that they are doing better at school. \"I would have been at home, lounging around doing nothing and not listening ... The help I've had has given me more confidence to achieve,\" one child told researchers. Parents say it is easier to know whom to ask for help and find they don't have to repeat their story as many times as they would have done previously. But some councils are finding it easier to deliver good quality children's services than others. Although no council was awarded poor or inadequate star ratings for its service for children and young people in the Audit Commission's comprehensive performance assessment, many were judged to be merely meeting minimum requirements and very few got the top rating of four stars. Part of the problem is that GPs and schools are not obliged to cooperate with other professionals under the 2004 Children Act. Many councils reported a lack of commitment from them. But John Coughlan, director of children's services at Hampshire county council, says even if there were a duty to cooperate, it would not necessarily lead to a cultural change. \"I cannot instruct a group of health visitors to play nicely with a group of educational psychologists,\" he says. And in many cases, schools do collaborate even if they are not obliged to. \"In Hampshire, we have over 500 schools. We see evidence of really positive joint working in the majority, and only pockets of resistance and defensiveness.\" \"It is the quality of relationships that matter more than formal structures,\" agrees John Freeman, director of children's services at Dudley metropolitan borough council. \"If I trust my local chief superintendent and he trusts me to work together effectively on common issues, such as underage drinking, it will work well; if my primary care trust chief executive thinks I am just trying to shunt my costs into her budget, then it won't work. And individual frontline workers may feel well joined-up or not on the same basis.\" Gateshead metropolitan borough council was one of the few councils given a four-star rating for its children's services, and its track record in keeping children safe is \"outstanding\". According to Alison Walton, director of children and young people at the council, Gateshead's success can be attributed to a lot of hard work to create and maintain good partnerships with other organisations, to ensure effective joint planning and commissioning of services, including training on common assessment and referral procedures. Walton says schools have been actively involved from the outset. In the end, even if every council were to adopt every aspect of best practice, it would not be able to guarantee every child's safety. \"The truth of our work is that the child protection element is always a risk,\" says Coughlan. \"We can't manage out that risk. We have got to have systems that are really, really vigilant and that focus on child protection.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
