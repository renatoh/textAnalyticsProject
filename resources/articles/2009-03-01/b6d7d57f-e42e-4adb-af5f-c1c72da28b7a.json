It was 2003 and the dotcom crash had given way to an explosion in lending and an unprecedented property price boom. In the UK, its mortgage lending was stuck at about 3% of the market and attempts to boost that figure had come to nothing. Expansion into new markets was the answer. Yet that dream, like so many in the British banking sector, lies shattered. HSBC Finance Corporation, renamed from Household after its purchase, is to be cut back and put into run-off. Staff will be told to wind up the operation. The bank is expected to write off \u00a37bn in goodwill and add a \u00a317bn provision against rising bad debt. While other failed lenders such as Washington Mutual and Countrywide will soldier on as subsidiaries of bigger banks, Household looks like slipping into the financial history books. Chairman Stephen Green and chief executive Michael Geoghegan, despite promoting its benefits for several years, have conceded the whole operation was a mistake. To some analysts it always appeared a desperate measure. Household was a poor fit with HSBC's operations as much of its business was in second-line mortgages, known in the US as piggyback loans, marketed to low-income homeowners who used the cash to buy anything from cars to conservatories. A large proportion of the loans were originated by other lenders and bought by Household in tranches. At the time they appeared to gift HSBC a bargain-basement entry into the US market. The loan books bought in haste were quickly considered to be of dubious quality. Household was also a large credit card lender and had a sizeable book of car loans, much of it to people on the lower reaches of the income scale. Many of these loans would wipe out any equity borrowers had previously enjoyed and pump their mortgages back to 100%. A little research would have turned revealed how unpopular Household was with many of its customers. In 2003 it was defending a long-running claim by thousands of borrowers that they were subjected to high-pressure selling. Another class action centred on claims that Household deliberately delayed attributing repayments by credit card customers to trigger fines and late-payment fees. The US securities and exchange commission reached a settlement at a cost to HSBC of $484m (\u00a3338m) over the high-pressure selling. Other claims were outstanding. Bond bought Household for \u00a39bn. By 2006 poor lending policies and a house price crash pushed the lender into deep financial trouble. Not only was it suffering from a growing list of lawsuits, its bad debts were expanding at an alarming rate. A string of interest rate rises were crippling the finances of many borrowers and forcing them to default. Since the summer of 2006 Household has lost the bank more than $30bn. Green, when he was chief executive, refused to jettison Household or consider it a fallen star. Once he was chairman and the losses too obvious to ignore he cut loose Bob Mehta, chief executive of sub-prime lender HSBC Finance Corporation. He also fired Sandy Derickson, chief executive of HSBC Bank USA. An embarrassing situation for a bank that prided itself on old-school colonial manners. Typically executives deemed surplus to requirements were allowed to slink off or shifted to far-flung posts. The severity of the crisis at Household left Green with no alternative."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
