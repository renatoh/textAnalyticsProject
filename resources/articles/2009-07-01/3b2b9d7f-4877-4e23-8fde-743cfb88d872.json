During a visit there last week we saw many attractions, such as an exhibition, shop and restaurant. However, it was the signs of the old ways of life that fascinated us and, in particular, the very old large building that dominated the scene. There are several of these in the area; they are called girnels and were used for storing grain crops, hence their other name of storehouses. The Foulis girnel, sometimes called the Old Rent House, was built in 1740 for the Foulis estate. The grain, mainly barley and oats, came from the very productive estates on the fertile coastal areas as payment in kind of agricultural rents. The grain was then handed out to farm workers as wages. There were also sales for export by sea so it was important for the girnels to be near the coast for ease of transport and loading boats. Indeed, the remains of the old pier can still be seen. The impressive 18th-century Foulis girnel has been fully restored; it is now a grade A listed building and houses historical and wildlife exhibitions. Near the west end of the girnel are examples of the old Cromarty Firth Cobbles. These are traditional wooden clinker boats which have been used for generations in the firth for salmon netting. There are examples of old nets and floats in the boats. Each cobble is named after a local character or story and this is explained on small display boards next to the boats. One is called Buller after James \"Buller\" Black and it was built in the mid-1970s. It was designed to carry a crew of up to six men and could hold a considerable quantity of salmon - in the 1970s a catch of 200 salmon on a single tide was not unusual.
