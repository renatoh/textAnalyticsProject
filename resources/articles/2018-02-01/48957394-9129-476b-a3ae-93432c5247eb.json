Check back later for his more considered reaction, along with post match reaction from Mauricio Pochettino and others. Asked if Spurs could have folded after going two down: \u201cWe could have done - away from home, Champions League, a big stage,\u201d he says in an interview with debonair BT Sport smoothie Des Kelly. \u201cBut we dominated after that. I had a chance just before [my goal] with the header and should have scored it. But you\u2019re always waiting for the next one and I got a great through ball from Dele.\u201d That was a statement performance from Spurs and they\u2019ll really fancy their chances in the second leg. Wembley, 7 March: That\u2019s the were and when for those of you wondering when the second leg of this thrilling tie will be. Tonight\u2019s was terrific, so make sure you catch the highlights. I guess you\u2019ll be able to get them free gratis on the BT Sport YouTube page later tonight or tomorrow. And no, I\u2019m not being paid to shill for them - but this was a wonderful football match. Post-match reaction: We\u2019ll have a match report from Turin here very shortly, but in the meantime here\u2019s somebody from Barney Ronay\u2019s brand management team with some post-match thoughts. Peep! Peep! Peep! It\u2019s all over and after a start that was the stuff of their worst nightmares, Tottenham leave Turin with this tie marginally poised in their favour. They take two away goals back to Wembley after a terrific comeback from two goals down. Against Juventus. In Turin. Not too many teams show that kind of resilience and character after such a dreadful start. Juventus had their chances to win the game, a Higuain penalty the pick of them, but having been 2-0 after 10 minutes, Spurs bullied the Italians on their own patch and possibly should have won. 90+1 min: Spurs substitution: Christian Eriksen off after a splendid, man of the match performance. Victor Wanyama on. Juve substitution: Douglas Costa off, Kwadwo Asamoah on. 90 min: The game enters its knockings with Juve finishing the stronger. After their nightmare start, even defeat for Spurs would be a brilliant result for them. If they hold on for the draw, it will be better still. A win for the visitors still isn\u2019t out of the question, mind. 88 min: Tottenham substitution: Lucas Moura on for his Spurs debut, Erik Lamela off. 87 min: Jan Vertonghen intercepts brilliantly, cutting out Douglas Costa\u2019s drilled cross and preventing the ball running to Gonzalo Higuain for a tap-in at the far post. Brilliant defending, although I initially thought thought he\u2019d poked the ball into his own net. It went just the right side of the upright. 85 min: Douglas Costa sends the ball into space behind the Spurs defence, hoping Higuain will run on to it. He overcooks his ball, which runs straight through to Hugo Lloris. 85 min: Juve win a corner. Pjanic pings the ball into the penalty area, where Medhi Benatia heads high and wide. 83 min: Tottenham substitution: Dele Alli off after a fairly decent performance; Heung-min Son on. 82 min: Serge Aurier blocks Douglas Costa\u2019s attempted cross into the Spurs penalty area, conceding a corner. The Juve man should perhaps have run at the Spurs defender in the hope of winning his side another penalty. Nothing comes of Pjanic\u2019s corner. 81 min: Tottenham get forward again, down the right flank. Serge Aurier curls in a decent cross, but it carries through to Gigi Buffon. 79 min: Rodrigo Bentancur is booked for a late challenge on Ben Davies\u2019s standing leg. Laughably, he claims the Tottenham player dived. The referee is having none of it. 77 min: Lloris saves well from a Bernardeschi shot that takes a big deflection off Eric Dier. Spurs go forward again - you\u2019d fancy them to go on and win this match now. Juventus and their fans seem totally shell-shocked. 74 min: While the local TV producer seems strangely reluctant to show a replay of Eriksen\u2019s equaliser, it seems that Gigi Buffon was completely wrong-footed by the Spurs midfielder. Juventus substitution: Mario Mandzukic off after a fine performance. Stefano Sturaro replaces him. Brilliant from Eriksen! The Dane counts on the wall jumping and whips the ball low and hard into the bottom left-hand corner. Buffon should have done better, but Spurs are level on the scoreboard, in the ascendancy on the pitch and have two away goal to their name. 70 min: Giorgio Chiellini fouls Del Alli on the edge of the D just in front of the Juve penalty area. A free-kick for Spurs in a great position. Over to you, Christian ... or Erik ... 69 min: Already on a yellow card, Medhi Benatia clatters through the back of Harry Kane. He somehow avoids a second yellow and can consider himself very lucky to do so. 68 min: Juventus win a free-kick about 40 yards from the Spurs goal. Miralem Pjanic overhits his ping in behind, which bounces straight through to Hugo Lloris. 66 min: Juventus substitution: Sami Khendira off, Uruguayan midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur on. 64 min: Tottenham get forward again, with Serge Aurier on the ball. He makes his way into the Juve penalty area, where Mario Mandzukic is again on hand to tackle and clear. He\u2019s playing a blinder in defence for his team, despite being a winger-striker by trade. 63 min: Spurs win a free-kick wide on the right. Christian Eriksen curls in a cross, which Gonzalo Higuain heads clear. 62 min: The match enters its final third - a huge 30 minutes for both sides. This is a terrific game of football; try to clap your eyes on some highlights later if at all possible. You won\u2019t be disappointed. 59 min: Miralem Pjanic goes down holding his head, while an absolutely furious Gonzalo Higuain gets a yellow card for simulation. He was fouled by Aurier and subsequently went down theatrically under a challenge from Jan Vertonghen. I think he was a bit hard done by and I also think Mauricio Pochettino should take Serge Aurier off before he gets sent off. 58 min: Miralem Pjanic plays the ball in from the corner flag and Mario Mandzukic rises highest to head straight at Lloris. he should have scored. It\u2019s a strange game - Juventus are seriously under the cosh and have been for some time, but have had squandered no end of chances to put the tie beyond Spurs. 57 min: Juventus gets forward, with Higuain picking out Bernardeschi on the right flank. He cuts inside on to his left foot and fires a low, hard, diagonal drive goalwards. Lloris tips the ball around the post for a corner. 56 min: Mousa Dembele cedes possession to Douglas Costa in midfield, but dives in to win it back before the Juve midfielder can turn on his after-burners. 55 min: Mario Mandzukic is back on the field, but doesn\u2019t look too comfortable. 54 min: First half possession stats: Spurs 72% Juventus 28%. Reminder: Juventus are at home. 53 min: Juventus gallop forward on the counter-attack with douglas Costa on the ball and Gonzalo Higuain to his right. With Bernardeschi up in support, the ball eventually comes his way. His low shot is week and easily intercepted. 52 min: Mario Mandzukic has pulled up with what looks like a hamstring injury and is receiving treatment behind the Spurs goal. 49 min: Spurs pick up where they left off at the end of the first half, bossing possession and keeping Juventus on the back foot. Their capitulation and concession of territory and possession after going 2-0 up at home so early was little short of weird. 47 min: Having sat back for 35 minutes of the first half, Juve have set up for the second with a much higher defensive line. Serge Aurier gets booked for a foul on Alex Sandro and will miss the second leg for Spurs. I suspect many of their supporters will be delighted. It will be interesting to see if Mauricio Pochettino leaves him on for much longer in this match - he\u2019s a bit of a liability at the best of times, but on a yellow card his continued presence could be disastrous. 46 min: Tottenham get the second half started and if it\u2019s anywhere near as good as the 45 minutes that preceded it, we\u2019re in for a real treat. No changes on either side yet. The stand-out Spurs players so far: Mousa Dembele and Christian Eriksen have been outstanding for Spurs, while Harry Kane has taken one of three presentable chances. Dele Alli has impressed too, while Ben Davies has been impressive going forward, but was caught out badly for Juve\u2019s first penalty. More on that second Higuain penalty: I thought Lloris might have palmed the ball on to the bar, but it seems that Higuain blasted it off the wood-work unassisted. For a man who\u2019d scored two goals in the first half, he cut a rather forlorn figure as he traipsed off at half-time. Aurier\u2019s challenge to concede the penalty was unspeakable brainless and it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s panicked like that this season. Rather charitably, the referee seems to have spared him the yellow card he definitely deserved. An email from Peter Dawson: \u201cI\u2019m surprised there\u2019s been no reference of Higuain being offside for the first goal,\u201d he says. \u201cThe broadcast only showed the side shot briefly. I pulled out the rewind and pause and Eriksen, who broke the line first, was half a body behind the Argentine.\u201d That\u2019s correct, Higuain was offside for his opener, but the Italian TV producer has been rather sparing with his replays and angles of several major incidents. There is no doubt Higuain was fractionally offside, but offside nonetheless. Wow! A seriously intense half of football ends with Tottenham 2-1 down, but in the ascendancy. The match started badly for them and went quickly downhill as they found themselves two down after nine minutes. Gonzalo Higuain did the damage, opening the scoring just after the minute-mark, before doubling his side\u2019s lead from the spot soon after. From that point on, Spurs dominated completely, eventually pulling a goal back through Harry Kane. Their good work almost unravelled just before half-time with the dumb concession of a penalty from Serge Aurier, but Gonzalo Higuain missed from 12 yards. This tie remains very much up for grabs. 45+2 min: Gonzalo Higuain shoots down the middle, Hugo Lloris stands his ground and - I think - palms the ball on to the cross-bar, from where it bounces out to safety. 45+1 min: Serge Aurier is skinned for pace by Douglas Costa and brings down the Juventus man on the left side of the Spurs penalty area. That was a stupid foul. Utterly gormless. 45 min: More good approach play by Spurs, but Bendavies gets his club selection all wrong and overhits his cross towards the far post. Juven get a goal-kick. 45 min: Medhi Benatia is booked for clattering through the back of Harry Kane. 43 min: Spurs continue to pile on the pressure, winning another corner off Chiellini after some neat interplay and a series of one-twos involving Alli, Eriksen and Aurier. The ball\u2019s played into the penalty area, where Mario Mandzukic wins a free-kick. Juve clear their lines again. 40 min: Tottenham continue to dominate as the home crowd in Turin grow increasingly impatient with their team\u2019s excessive caution. Christian Eriksen brings a save out of Buffon with a shot from distance. Moments later, he sends in a cross which Del Alli - peeling off his marker and backing towards the near post - leaps to head over. 38 min: Hats off to Dele Alli for his assist there - he slid a nicely weighted ball in behind and Kane beat the offside trap to get on it. Banishing all thoughts of his earlier miss, he took it past Buffon, before firing it low and hard into the empty net. 36 min: That\u2019s been coming for a while - instead of trying to finish Spurs off after taking a two-goal lead, Juventus have let their opponents have far too much of the ball while choosing to sit back and let them come at them. Spurs might be 2-1 down, but Juventus are rattled and on the back foot. Kane scores! Tottenham pull a goal back and it\u2019s no more than they deserve. Harry Kane latches on to a fine pass from Alli, takes the ball around Buffon and slots it into an empty net. 32 min: Another chance for Spurs, but Kane fails to connect properly and drags a low diagonal effort inches wide. Buffon dived to get a touch and Spurs have a corner. The ball\u2019s sent into the mixer, where Mandzukic heads clear. 30 min: A brilliant tackle by Mattia De Sciglia on Dele Alli in the Juve penalty area leads to a counter-attack for the home side. Pjanic and Gonzalo Higuain exchange passes as they maraud forward, with Tottenham\u2019s defenders in hot pursuit. With the ball at his feet in the Tottenham penalty area, Higuain makes room for a shot, before rifling the ball narrowly wide of the upright. A massive let-off for Spurs there. 28 min: Spurs continue to grow into a game they looked likely to lose by a cricket score after just 10 minutes. They win a free-kick wide on the left, but Christian Eriksen\u2019s cross into the box is uncharacteristically poor. CHANCE!!! Harry Kane is presented with the kind of chance you\u2019d expect him to score in his sleep: a perfectly weighted pass from Christian Eriksen leaves him with the goal at his mercy from about six yards out. His bullet header from point-blank range is saved brilliantly by Gigi Buffon, but truth-be-told, Kane shouldn\u2019t have given him a chance to save it. 24 min: Spurs try to get forward again, but Juve have all 11 men behind the ball, massed in two banks of six and four. On BT Sport, co-comms man Jemaine Jenas points out that striker Mario Mandzukic is playing at left-back. 22 min: Erik Lamela takes the corner, Giorgio Chiellini wins a free kick after being fouled by Kane and Juve clear their lines. With a quarter of the match gone, Kane is already cutting a fairly forlorn and frustrated figure. 19 min: Tottenham continue to dominate possession, as they have for the nine minutes since going two down. They\u2019re not doing much with it, mind - Juve are coping comfortably with what little\u2019s been thrown at them so far. Mattia Die Sciglio concedes a corner as he defends a Kane cross towards Alli at the far post. 17 min: Under a \u201cchallenge\u201d from Medhi Benatia, Harry Kane throws himself theatrically to the floor in the Juve penalty area and appeals for a spot-kick. None is forthcoming. Kane protests to the referee, but he looked to be chancing his arm there. I\u2019ll need to see it again to be sure. 16 min: On the edge of his own penalty area, Eric Dier tries to lump the ball forward for Spurs. Douglas Costa closes him down and blocks the shot, but it rolls harmlessly back to Hugo Lloris in the Spurs goal. 15 min: Christian Eriksen cuts in from the right flank and tries to pick out Harry Kane with a cross. Giorgio Chiellini clears with a header. 14 min: Spurs enjoy a period of sustained possession in the middle third of the pitch but are unable to make inroads of any kind as far as getting the ball into the Juve penalty area is concerned. 13 min: Davinson Sanchez sends the ball long from deep, attempting to pick out Dele Alli. Juventus clear. 11 min: Yet to settle in this match and already waist-deep in the brown stuff, Spurs win a corner. Erik Lamela sends the ball towards the near post, where Higuain heads clear. 10 min: Well, who saw this coming? Tottenham can have no complaints over the award of that penalty: Ben Davies was late with his challenge on Federico Bernardeschi and got booked for his troubles. Gonzalo Higuain dispatched the spot-kick with aplomb, rifling the ball just inside the upright. Hugo Lloris went the right way, but just couldn\u2019t reach the ball. Gonazalo Higuain scores from the spot. Less than 10 minutes into this tie and Spurs are already on the ropes. This is a disaster. 8 min: Ben Davies trips Bernardeschi in the Tottenham penalty area and the referee points to the spot. 7 min: With Erik Lamela on the ball, Tottenham try to get forward but meet a wall of resistance with even Gonzalo Higuain back helping out his side\u2019s rearguard action. 5 min: Mario Mandzukic gets in behind Davinson Sanchez but is flagged for offside as he tries to get on to a Federico Bernardeschi cross from the left touchline. A let-off for Spurs. 3 min: Tottenham get off to the worst possible start in Turin, going a goal down in less than 80 seconds. Pjanic won a free-kick about 40 yards from goal, a might right of centre. Placing the ball, it looked like he\u2019d curl it towards the far post, but instead he tool it quickly, lofting a perfectly weighted ball straight ahead towards Higuain. From not too far inside the penalty area, the Argentinian striker spun and hooked a perfect diagonal volley into the far corner. 2 min: Juventus win an early free-kick, it\u2019s taken quickly by Miralem Pjanic to Gonzalo Higuain, who hooks a wonderful volley into the bottom left-hand corner. 1 min: Juventus get the ball rolling, their players in their customary home strip of black and white striped shirts, white shorts and white socks. Spurs line up in purply-blue shirts, shorts and socks with yellow trim. Yes, purply-blue - that\u2019s what it looks like to me. The teams leave their dressing rooms, line up in the tunnel area and march out on to the pitch for the last of the pre-match niceties: the Champions League anthem, handshakes, the coin-toss, photos, more handshakes ... kick-off is just moments away. Well, good for those of us type minute-by-minute Champions League match reports for spare change. Juventus: Buffon, De Sciglio, Benatia, Chiellini, Alex Sandro, Khedira, Pjanic, Bernardeschi, Douglas Costa, Mandzukic, Higuain. Subs: Szczesny, Rugani, Asamoah, Marchisio, Bentancur, Sturaro, Muratore Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Aurier, Sanchez, Vertonghen, Davies, Dier, Dembele, Eriksen, Alli, Lamela, Kane Subs: Gazzaniga, Trippier, Rose, Wanyama, Sissoko, Son, Lucas Referee: Felix Brych (Germany) 4-2-3-1: Lloris, Aurier, Vertonghen, Sanchez, Davies; Dier, Dembele; Lamela, Alli, Eriksen, Kane. The full-back is a surprise inclusion at the expense of Kieran Trippier. Erik Lamela is also in the Spurs starting 11, while Heung-Min Son has to settle for a place on the bench. We\u2019ll have the full line-ups for you very shortly. Asked if Tottenham would tone down their attacking tendencies ahead of tonight\u2019s game, the Tottenham manager suggested it would go against God and nature ... sort of. \u201cWe cannot change our principles. We will have to be aggressive, brave, respect our opponents. When I started playing I dreamed to be involved in games like this but now I think step by step. \u201cWhen the draw for the group stage happened everybody thought Real Madrid first, and Dortmund second. We won the group stage instead and now we are here. We have to show the desire to go to the next stage, play well, score goals, something which is so tough to do here. We must be competitive and keep going the way we are playing. Some of our recent performances were fantastic and we can certainly play again on that level tomorrow.\u201d Asked about tonight\u2019s opposition, this is what the Juventus manager had to say in his media briefing yesterday. \u201cWe know their strengths and we know that we will have to suffer for some parts of the game because Tottenham have four players with great quality in attack,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we grew up, especially in terms of confidence, and we did that because we have achieved very good results in Europe. Only Real Madrid have done better in my opinion in recent years. \u201cI\u2019m only sure that we will have to play very well technically because Tottenham will beat us in a physical battle. We need to play with attention and always try to keep our balance because it\u2019s difficult for one team to dominate the other in such a balanced tie. Small details can make all the difference in the world.\u201d Blaise Matuidi, Juan Cuadrado and Benedict Howedes are all injured for Juventus, while Paulo Dybala has also been ruled out with a hamstring injury. \u201c\u201cWe hope he\u2019d be available, I cannot take risk,\u201d said Juve manager Max Allegri. \u201cHe\u2019s an important player, we can not accelerate his recovery and then lose him all the season.\u201d After his fine performances in the group stages, the Argentinian will be a big loss and will be replaced by Douglas Costa or Federico Bernnardeschi. Claudio Marchisio started in place of Matuidi against Fiorentina last Friday night, but Rodrigo Bentancur and Stefano Sturaro may also be considered for inclusion this evening. Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino has a full squad to choose from, but has not included Toby Alderweireld in his plans for tonight. The Belgian central defender played for Tottenham in their FA Cup replay against Newport County last week after returning from a period on the sidelines with a ham,string injury, but was not in Tottenham\u2019s match-day squad for their win over Arsenal. Mauricio Pochettino was uncharacteristically tetchy when quizzed on Alderweireld\u2019s absence in the wake of that win. He says he omitted him from tonight\u2019s travelling party because the player is not yet fit enough. There is speculation that Heung Min Son could miss out on a starting spot tonight, as Victor Wanyama may be preferred to add some midfield steel. After almost 100 preliminary qualifiers and 96 group games, we\u2019re down to the final 16 of this season\u2019s Champions League. Jose Mourinho observed back in November that for most teams, the tournament begins in earnest here in the knockout stages and Tottenham have faced few sterner tests so far this season than the one looming over two legs at the Allianz Stadium in Turin and their temporary digs at Wembley Stadium. Second in Serie A and neck and neck with leaders Napoli, Juventus are unbeaten since 19 November and have conceded just a single goal \u2013 against Verona - in 16 matches since that reverse at the hands of Sampdoria. They will have their work cut out stopping Harry Kane smashing through the portcullis \u2013 the Spurs striker has scored 36 goals in all competitions so far this season and has bagged eight in his past seven games. He has failed to score just once in that run of matches; his team\u2019s 2-0 win over Manchester United. Juventus rarely concede and Tottenham rarely draw blanks - something has got to give over what promises to be two fascinating legs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
