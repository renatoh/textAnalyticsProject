Villa are eight points behind Manchester City, having played a game fewer but with a vastly inferior goal difference, and O'Neill believes that deficit has left them with no margin for error between now and the end of the season. The Villa manager has urged his players to \"fight back\" in the wake of Saturday's FA Cup semi-final defeat to Chelsea, when he felt the major decisions went against them, but he also acknowledged that to keep their dream of a top-four finish alive a renascent Everton side must be overcome at home tomorrow . \"It won't be easy but it's a game that, to keep ourselves in contention, we would have to win,\" said O'Neill, who confirmed James Milner will be fit despite John Terry's controversial challenge at Wembley. \"I really think there wouldn't be much room for slip-ups between now and the end of the season. For us, it's a six-game season in the Premiership and I still think there is plenty to play for. [There are] European places at stake obviously and I think [the top four] genuinely is worth fighting for because no run-in of the teams involved with the points accumulated [Manchester City and Tottenham] is easy.\" While City and Tottenham both have tough run-ins, including a meeting between each other at Eastlands in the final week of the season and two matches apiece against top-three opponents, Villa enjoy a more comfortable finish. The most testing fixture will be the trip to City on the penultimate weekend of the season, but otherwise there are visits to lowly Hull and Portsmouth and home matches against Birmingham and Blackburn. Asked whether Villa would need maximum points from that run of games, O'Neill said: \"That would be pretty well my view. At this stage of the season you would have to be winning your games. And I think the points total that the teams can get will still be pretty decent so to accumulate those points you would be thinking about a substantial number of wins in the six games.\" That promises to be a tall order for a team that have won only four of their 12 league matches this year but O'Neill insists there is no shortage of motivation within his squad. \"We've been battling all season,\" he said. \"There is no reason for us now to give it up. We've had a couple of disappointments at Wembley but we have to go and really fight back. And I think the players are determined.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
