Dann Thorleifsson and Arne Leivsgard, who five years ago founded the watch company Kankse, had purchased Paris Chic, one of Tal R\u2019s brightly coloured Sexshops series, for \u00a370,000 at the Victoria Miro Gallery in London in August. Copenhagen\u2019s maritime and commercial court ruled in favour of Tal R, forbidding the duo from going ahead with their project and ordering them to pay 31,550 Danish krone (\u00a33,600) in legal costs, arguing that as the scheme was an alternation rather than a destruction of the work, it contravened copyright law. The project, the court added, misused Tal R\u2019s artistic standing for commercial gain, and threatened to damage his reputation. The artist\u2019s lawyer, J\u00f8rgen Permin, said after the verdict that he was \u201cvery pleased with the very clear decision\u201d. \u201cWe hope it will mark the end of this case and that it will mean that Tal R and his fellow artists may avoid similar disputes in the future,\u201d he added. On Monday afternoon Thorleifsson and his partner were still discussing with their lawyer whether to reach a settlement, appeal the injunction, or to push ahead with a full-court case next month. \u201cIt\u2019s not the best verdict for us,\u201d Thorleifsson conceded. \u201cThere had been a lot of examples discussed in court but they painted it as very black and white.\u201d In October, the pair revealed plans to use Tal R\u2019s canvas as raw material to manufacture between 200 and 300 watches for Letho, their new brand, which they aimed to sell for at least 10,000 Danish krone each. In its verdict, the court showed a screengrab from an online auction on Letho\u2019s website where a buyer had offered 41,000 Danish krone for a chance to be the first to choose which piece of canvas they wanted. \u201cWe needed an artist that was esteemed by experts because we also needed to get a reaction,\u201d Thorleifsson said. \u201cIf we just took a $100 canvas, no one would really care. It needed to be a true masterpiece.\u201d The duo, who also run a Copenhagen based design studio, have purchased paintings by three other recognised Danish artists, John K\u00f8rner, David Birkemose and Jens Birkemose, assisted by funding from an unnamed patron. In October Tal R dismissed the pair\u2019s plan calling it a \u201cdisrespectful\u201d attempt \u201cto make money and get attention by making a product out of my art\u201d. His legal team had argued that the scheme was a clear case of copyright infringement. \u201cHe acknowledges that whoever purchases one of his works would be at liberty to sell it on or even destroy the work,\u201d his lawyer said. \u201cBut what he is not obliged to accept is for someone to alter the work and then reintroduce it to the public domain, and particularly not for commercial reasons.\u201d Heidi H\u00f8jmark Helveg, who represented Thorleifsson and Leivsgard, had argued that as the project involved destroying rather than altering the work, it was legal under Danish law. \u201cThe pieces will be so small that it will not possible to know in any way which work it is from,\u201d she said. \u201cEach watch will take just 0.04% of the original work.\u201d Tal R\u2019s legal team argued that argument failed because the watches would be marketed \u201cspecifically as having Tal R\u2019s painting as background\u201d. While the pair\u2019s now discontinued Kanske brand had been a commercial venture, Thorleifsson said their Letho project intended to test the boundaries of art. \u201cIt\u2019s not a commercial project, but we don\u2019t know if it is an artistic project. That has to be determined by others,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
