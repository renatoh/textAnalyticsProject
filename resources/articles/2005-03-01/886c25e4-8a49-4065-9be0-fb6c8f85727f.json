Fawlty Towers had 12 episodes, The Office 12 and two Christmas specials. Such short runs do not make economic sense in America in terms of production costs, promotional budgets and advertising revenue. If the Americans see something over here that they like, they want to make their own version so that if it works, they can make lots of it. Ben McCrory Manchester As an expat living in the US I think the answer is simple: accents and slang. Americans can just about handle BBC English, but cannot handle anything from the Midlands on up. That, combined with a huge amount of slang and uniquely British colloquialisms in the programmes, means they have to be translated to make any sense to the average American. By contrast, UK audiences are continually exposed to American accents and slang through movies and television so never have a problem with them. Andy Pennell Kirkland, Washington USA I have just spent five painful years living in North America watching trashy comedies, and I can assure you that miserable American remakes are not uncommon. It happens to lots of decent British comedies. And to watch well made British documentaries like Walking With Dinosaurs where the original British voiceover was re-dubbed by a guy with an American accent was infuriating. Why do they do it? From my experience, people think that it can't be good if it's not American. After five years, I realised why children - and sometimes adults - often asked me: \"So what language do you speak in Australia?\" After living in a place where newspapers were more like infomercials and I had to pay $50 a month to watch TV produced in an intellectual vacuum, I wake up every day and am thankful I am here.
