The 108th mayor led New York through the months after 9/11, and oversaw faltering efforts to restore its wounded skyline; he led the battle to reduce the illegal firearms entering the city; recognised the economic imperative of keeping the financial services industry in the city after the banking crisis of 2008; supported the arts \u2014 often anonymously \u2014 when grants were being cut to restore the city\u2019s $6bn budget deficit to surplus. Perhaps the biggest endorsement of Bloomberg\u2019s triple term is in the number of jobs for which his name has been floated since, domestically and internationally and across the political spectrum. With his company, Bloomberg LP, having a major presence in London, there were ludicrous rumours he might run for mayor of London; in the US he\u2019s touted as a potential challenger for the 2016 Democratic nomination or as an independent. But there\u2019s no indication that, at 73, he\u2019s assembling the kind of data-crunching study he\u2019d require to examine the possibility. He looked at it in 2008 before concluding that, while his mayoralty might play well in New York and internationally, the likelihood of US voters returning a diminutive, Jewish New York billionaire to the White House were slim. Still, as evidence mounts that big money in politics does little but drive down voter interest (and turnout), Bloomberg could in theory sidestep campaign finance issues by dipping into his $20bn-plus data services fortune. Bloomberg remains, in effect, a billionaire knight errant. He\u2019s running Bloomberg LP with the former Economist editor John Micklethwait at his side, and Bloomberg Philanthropies with former sideman Dan Doctoroff. He\u2019s established a for-hire consultancy group to help struggling urban administration worldwide, launched a war on coal, a war on tobacco, and looks set to direct his energy and fortune toward curbing climate change by making the world\u2019s cities become more energy-efficient and livable. While the former Salomon Brothers trader spends more time at his home in London, it seems unlikely he\u2019ll abandon the Big Apple. \u201cThis is the city of dreamers,\u201d he has said. \u201cTime and again it\u2019s the place where the greatest dream of all, the American dream, has been tested and has triumphed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
