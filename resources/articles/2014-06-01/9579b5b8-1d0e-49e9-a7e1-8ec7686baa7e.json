The Commons environment, food and rural affairs committee said that while public opinion and welfare groups backed an outright ban, the \"draconian\" step should not be taken without compelling evidence in its favour. Estimates of the numbers of pet primates in the UK vary wildly from below 1,000 to as high as 20,000, according to a report published by the committee on Tuesday. Many are marmosets, capuchins and squirrel monkeys. The MPs called on the government to commission independent research on the number and living conditions of such pets and recommended changes to existing regulations to ensure the animals' wellbeing. \"We take the welfare of primates in captivity very seriously, so we were surprised to find that so little is known about the types and numbers of primates being kept or traded by private individuals in the UK and about the manner in which they are being kept,\" said Anne McIntosh, chair of the committee. She said government must ensure that primates were kept as well in private homes as they are in zoos, pet shops and circuses. A Primate Code brought into force in 2010 is due to be reviewed next year. \"We do not rule out a ban, but conclude that such a step must be based on solid evidence and cannot be imposed before every opportunity to improve the operation of our existing framework has been exhausted. \"If these suggested changes prove insufficient and the evidence for doing so proves compelling, then a ban on the trade and keeping of privately kept primates should remain an option for the future,\" she said. The RSPCA estimates there are 3,000 to 9,000 primates being kept as pets in the UK, but that figure may be rising due to the ease of buying the animals over the internet. \"There is an alarming lack of regulation around the sale of primates and this makes it incredibly difficult to monitor,\" said Ros Clubb at the RSPCA. \"Primates have very complex needs and the level of suffering is high if these requirements are not met. In short primates are wild animals that cannot have their needs met in a household environment. They are not pets. \"Specialist expert knowledge and facilities are required to look after primates properly, which the vast majority of people lack. This is illustrated by the increase in the number of convictions for cruelty to primates we have recorded,\" Clubb said. Philip Mansbridge from Care for the Wild said: \"The report says that there are a lot of unknowns: we don't know how many primates are kept as pets, we don't know how well they are kept, we don't know if existing legislation is working. \"But deep down, we do know one thing: that monkeys, chimpanzees and other primates ultimately are not objects for us to own. And that information alone should be enough to settle this debate once and for all. \"It's true that currently under the Animal Welfare Act, pet owners must supply a suitable environment for an animal and allow it to exhibit normal behaviour. \"But no matter how you cut it, monkeys should be swinging in the trees with their family, not stuck in someone's back yard in Birmingham. \"We need to stop thinking about whether we can look after primates as pets, and start wondering whether we should. And frankly, we shouldn't. \"The fact that no-one knows how many there are just illustrates a key part of the problem. I understand there are fears that by banning primates as pets, it would drive this activity underground. But if we don't know how many there are, it's already underground.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
