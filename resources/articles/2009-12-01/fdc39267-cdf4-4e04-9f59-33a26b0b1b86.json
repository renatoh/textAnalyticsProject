Nicholas Hytner, director of the National, had been looking for ways to make the theatre's work more accessible and was excited about a project called NT Live, which would see National productions broadcast, as they happened, to cinema audiences around the world. Would I let my script be part of the pilot season of NT Live? Thrilled at the thought of hundreds of thousands of people around the world gathering together to see a single performance of a play I was working on, I immediately said yes. It made me think back to my very first attempt at making a film. I was five when I saw Frederick Ashton's Tales of Beatrix Potter, and was instantly obsessed with how Ashton had used incredible costumes and brilliant actor/dancers to bring alive the illustrations of Potter's books, which I'd previously found rather dull. Undaunted by my extreme youth, I was determined to make my own film of Potter's tales. I cajoled my dad into providing his cine-camera and organised a family visit to a nearby wood. There, I dressed my brother and I in sheets, as we pranced in front of the camera as Jemima Puddle-Duck and Mrs Tiggy-Winkle. I was particularly proud of the green stocking that, when pulled over my head, turned me into the spitting image of Jeremy Fisher, Potter's angling frog. Since Nation is a production for family audiences, I wanted young peoples' views of the novel, and their film-making abilities, to somehow form part of the NT Live screening. Terry Pratchett readily agreed and so, a couple of months ago, the Guardian issued a challenge to its young readers \u2013 to dramatise a section of the novel selected by Pratchett himself and upload the results to YouTube. Wise words were offered from Philip Pullman and Michael Morpurgo about their experiences of having their work adapted for the stage. I hope their advice was useful. It was certainly a source of hope and inspiration to me: I pinned it above my desk. We received over 50 YouTube entries from young people around the country, whose interpretations of the extract were clever, witty, and technically impressive. The year eight pupils of Ellen Wilkinson School for Girls in London deserve a special mention for their entries, filmed as an English assignment for teacher Nina de Lucca: the girls created an imaginary ship out of the bike sheds, donned fake moustaches, and recited their lines amid hockey sticks in the PE storeroom. Last week, the competition's judges \u2013 Terry Pratchett, Nicholas Hytner, Guardian theatre critic Lyn Gardner, journalist Matthew Hemley from the Stage, and myself \u2013 watched the shortlisted entries. I clicked on the first link with trepidation: had I been idealistic about young people's film-making abilities? Were the judging panel about to be subjected to some embarrassing efforts? I needn't have worried. It was an exciting experience to see how young people had imagined the scene Pratchett had selected: the first meeting between shipwrecked Victorian girl Daphne and South Sea islander Mau. The winner of the youngest age group was swiftly chosen: 14-year-old Billy Godfrey, whose film used animated Plasticine figures. Pratchett spoke for us all when he said: \"I really loved Billy's Plasticine. It rang an ancient bell in my head. The figures are quite Morph-like.\" As well as being incredibly accomplished technically, Billy's figures captured Pratchett's voice: the novel's wit and pathos are perfectly realised in his gem of a film. The entrants in the older age group, 15 to 17, were predominantly female, drawn by the romantic possibilities of the relationship between Daphne and Mau. The standard of entries was so high that voting reached near deadlock. Despite her covering note, apologising for the fact that, due to practical constraints, she'd had to cast a girl as Mau, Scarlett Marshall's entry finally took the prize. Her film perfectly caught the tension and excitement of Daphne and Mau's first meeting. I'm delighted that such fantastic work will next month be broadcast, along with my stage version of Nation, to thousands of people in cinemas around the world. That's certainly a bigger audience than my homemade Beatrix Potter film ever got."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
