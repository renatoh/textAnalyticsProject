Your bum looks big in that...", "bodyText": "'ll be honest - the prospect of meeting Susannah and Trinny is terrifying. I imagine it as similar to being cornered by feverish evangelists, convinced that it is both their mission and their right to save you from the unwitting folly of your present lifestyle by taking you in hand and teaching you their way. This is an impression I've acquired from their new series, What Not To Wear, which seems to have been based on a cross between Changing Rooms and Would Like To Meet. Unsuspecting women like you or me, happily going about their business in saggy old shorts and badly cut dresses, are nominated for a make-over by apparently sadistic friends and relations. They are then filmed secretly over the course of several weeks, so that Susannah and Trinny can sprawl elegantly over their sofa, shaking their heads and sharply drawing in breath as they watch the footage with the same expressions of compassion and empathetic pain that most of us reserve for Animal Hospital. 'You see, those trousers just make her arse look huge,' they comment ruefully, or 'Something has to be done about that hair,' or 'She shouldn't be wearing vest tops with those upper arms.' When they have compiled a comprehensive list of the woman's crimes against decency and good taste, they confront her, usually in her place of work, to tell her that all her friends think she looks like crap. Not in so many words, of course, but there's no nice way of telling someone they clearly need help getting dressed - though the obvious way to make it palatable is to dangle a cheque for \u00a32,000 to kit themselves out with a new wardrobe. But preconceptions are always dangerous. Susannah Constantine, 39, and Trinny Woodall, 37, may be posh girls obsessed with shopping, but they are also successful businesswomen; they take enormous care over their appearance, but they don't diet or compulsively exercise; they are critical, but they get away with it because they are self-critical, too, and they don't mind sending themselves up and looking silly. They're a little bit Ab Fab and they know it; they can talk the talk if need be, but they do it knowingly, and they don't hang out at the designer parties, rarely go to shows and love to thumb their noses at the self-consciousness of the fashion industry. 'If I ever do go to those parties, I'll always turn up in a dress from Dorothy Perkins or something,' says Trinny, with a mischievous grin. 'And then someone will say, \"Oh, I love your dress, who is it?\", and you say, \"Dorothy Perkins\", and they look at you as if to say, \"Oh, poor you\", which I just think is really funny.' 'We're not interested in fashion,' Susannah explains. 'I think we've been successful because we try to look at what women want - our advice is all about personal style that's a more enduring way to approach clothes.' The pair were introduced by a mutual friend, though they had known each other by reputation as part of a Tatler society scene. (Susannah used to date David Linley - 15 years ago, but it's a label that has been hard to shake off.) They had expected not to like each other ('Like you always do when a friend tells you there's someone you really should meet'), but found they had a mutual interest in style, and their proposition for a regular feature in the Telegraph weekend section followed shortly afterwards. 'I'd always loved clothes,' says Trinny, 'and I had to learn to be creative, because when I was 17 my father lost all his money, so I went from being able to have most things I wanted to having to buy clothes secondhand or from really cheap shops, and then I'd customise them - you know, I'd put different collars on jackets so that they looked like designer ones.' The 'Ready To Wear' page expanded to become a television show for GSB, a book, Ready To Dress, with a fuschia cover showing the two naked but for two melons (Susannah) and two fried eggs (Trinny) strategically placed over their breasts - and eventually a website, Ready2wear.com, valued at \u00a310m at its peak at the end of 1999, and now gone the way of all dotcoms. 'I really miss having the business,' says Trinny, wistfully. 'I'm a bit of a techno-nerd and I had a business background so I really enjoyed being back in that world, going to all the meetings, working out how we were going to expand it. But it became clear at the end of the first two years that we weren't going to raise the money to carry on with it. When the business folded, it made us take stock a bit.' In person, they are neither as frivolous nor as condescending as the programme makes them appear. 'I suppose that's part of the appeal,' Susannah says, 'that for some people we'll be those two snotty cows that everyone loves to hate.' If Susannah sees someone buying something she doesn't approve of she 'won't think twice' about telling them. 'I once went up to a woman who was buying her daughter a choker in a shop and said, \"Don't buy her that, her neck's too short and she looks terrible. Get her something like this instead\". Another time I saw a woman on a plane with this real drag queen make-up and I took her into the loo and made her wipe it off, and showed her how to do her make-up properly. She was actually really pretty underneath.' Has she ever been punched? 'No - people seem really pleased when you take an interest. Obviously you have to find a nice way of saying it - I'd say, \"You have such beautiful lips, you don't need to put all that lipliner on.\" Something like that. Although I think the woman on the plane thought I was trying to pick her up.' And, as if on cue, they turn their gimlet eyes on me. I had hoped that being six months pregnant might distract them but this was clearly no excuse. 'No, look at this - you're tenting,' says Susannah, tugging at my baggy shirt and shaking her head woefully. (Tenting?) The first thing you have to accept, I realise, is their girls' school frankness - if you want them to make you over, you can't be precious about any part of your body. 'What are your tits like?' says Trinny, frowning, and there, in the middle of Caf\u00e9 Rouge, has a good squeeze to find out. 'When Suze was pregnant she wore a lot of sarongs,' she says thoughtfully. 'I wore an underwired bra all the way through both my pregnancies,' Susannah adds, nodding proudly at this heresy. Before I can announce a stout refusal of both sarongs and underwires, Trinny's face suddenly illuminates. 'I know exactly what you need!' she cries, and charges out of the restaurant and across the road to Sweaty Betty, an upmarket sports shop, where she forces me into a pair of Christy Turlington's yoga trousers. They are very, very comfortable, and completely unforgiving. 'Hmm.' Trinny contemplates the effect with her head on one side. 'They're a bit...' she rummages for the right word - 'clitty.' 'But now your legs look really thin. Don't ever buy maternity clothes, they're terrible,' says Susannah, who has a son, Joe, nearly three, and a daughter, Esme, who is just six months. 'I just bought really stretchy things so I could wear them afterwards. Trouble is,' she lifts her top in full view of the whole shop, grabs two handfuls of flesh and ripples them vigorously, 'this is what happens to you afterwards. I haven't done any exercise since Esme was born - when I'm not working, I don't want to be in the gym, I want to be with my children.' Trinny cheerfully joins in all this talk of bumps and nursing bras, though it must be difficult for her - she has been undergoing IVF treatment and had a miscarriage the previous week, though she talks about it with customary openness. 'I'm fine, really. I mean - my hormones are all over the place and I'm still hungry all the time, but it's such a common thing to happen. It's encouraging to know that so many people have been through the same thing.' In Zara, we try on leather coats and long dresses; in Oasis they scoop up armfuls of shirts, and force me into a lime green lycra top that gives me the appearance of a cantaloupe melon; in Jigsaw they try on long skirts without bothering to use the changing rooms, standing in the middle of the shop in their tights and knickers; in French Connection they plough through a swathe of jumpers to illustrate how colours as well as styles can profoundly influence the way you look. 'I have to set myself a budget every month for clothes,' says Trinny, 'otherwise I would just go mad. But this skirt I'm wearing is \u00a314.99 from Hennes. Mind you, when something is that cheap I get worried now - I think of how much they must be paying the workers in the Far East. I read Naomi Klein's book No Logo, and since then I haven't bought anything in Gap. Which is a shame, because they do have the best cords in London. Actually, in the show we do take people there, but I wouldn't shop there for myself on principle now.' 'I spend less money on clothes now that I've got the children,' says Susannah. 'To be honest, I get a bit bored shopping. Trinny's the one who goes out and about looking at stuff. She could shop forever. You'd think we'd get loads of freebies but actually we don't...' 'It's because we're too critical,' Trinny adds. 'Some shops have said they don't want to be featured on our page because half the time we're showing things that we think are terrible, or badly made, so they don't think we're very good publicity.' They have an encyclopedic knowledge of the season's styles in each of the main high street stores, but their professionalism doesn't seem to have taken any of the pleasure out of the business of shopping - they squeal with delight at each other in the changing rooms like 14-year-olds out on a Saturday. I've come out with one jumper; they seem to have multiple bags swinging from each arm like Alicia Silverstone in Clueless . For the first time, I have understood the allure of having a style consultant: the new kind of boldness at having been encouraged to wear something you wouldn't usually have thought of as 'you', and the confirmation of being told it looks great, even the hard-to-swallow advice that certain staples of your wardrobe are not doing you any favours. True, it isn't nuclear physics, and it won't put an end to war and strife, but I am prepared to concede I am almost converted. \u00b7 Susannah and Trinny's What Not To Wear will be shown on BBC2 from early November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
