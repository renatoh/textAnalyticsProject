Having started with a 2-2 draw against Russia, we needed a good result against Brazil and we fancied our chances when they left out Pele and Garrincha because they were worried about our physical approach. We still had to watch out for Didi, who was a wonderfully creative player. But we had the likes of Don Howe, Bill Slater and skipper Billy Wright, who was absolutely terrific on the day. Up front, we were without Tom Finney, who was injured, but I thought we gave as good as we got and were well worth a point. On 2002: What I've learned over the years, as a player and a manager, is that you need a trick or two up your sleeve to compete successfully at the highest level. You face different problems in the finals of the World Cup and I believe that players like Michael Owen and David Beckham, who has been fantastic since becoming captain, can provide the answers tomorrow. England to win and go all the way? Why ever not? Joel, right-wing On 1958: The game really was of two halves. In the first half we played better. In the second half they played better. It ended up 0-0 and that was a fair result. It was a very difficult game. We ran around a lot. The English marked very well, their defence was well prepared with one defender spare. It was a very equal game. We both had the same amount of chances. It was the only game we drew in the 1958 World Cup and the last game we played without Pele and Garrincha. In the following match against the Soviet Union Garrincha took my place and Pele was also in the side. We won 2-0 and the rest, as they say, is history. On 2002: The game on Friday will be the best game of the cup. Both teams are playing marvellously - they are the best two teams of the tournament. Whoever wins this game goes to the final. England have come a long way since I played them. They used to cross the ball all the time and try to head it in. Now they are a passing team. The English are very good. It will be very difficult for us. Chile 1962 Brazil 3 England 1 Jimmy Armfield, right-back On 1962: We didn't have groups of death back then but that's what they would have called ours after we were bracketed with Argentina, Hungary and Bulgaria. Just as this time we had a disappointing start, losing 2-1 to Hungary but then beat Argentina 3-1. That left us needing a draw against Bulgaria in our final game and we managed a 0-0, much like the match against Nigeria this time. Garrincha gave them the lead with a header but after Gerry Hitchens equalised, we got on top and Gilmar made a fantastic save from Jimmy Greaves. But Ron Springett was unable to hold a fantastic free-kick from Garrincha and Vava nodded the rebound home before Garrincha scored a fantastic effort from 25 yards that dipped and moved. On 2002: At this World Cup, I can't say whether Brazil have peaked already or whether they are never going to peak because this is not one of their great sides. Rivaldo does seem to be coming back to form but I definitely fancy us a bit, especially if Michael Owen is fit. Mario Zagallo, left-wing On 1962: England opened the score but we were the World Cup holders by then and had experience in the team. Garrincha was on absolutely stunning form. He scored twice and we managed to turn the game round 3-1. But all the games against England are very difficult. We are great football nations. On 2002: We are two countries who play football of the highest order. England have been the most consistent team so far. Brazil haven't played to their full potential. But Brazil have won every game, so they're doing something right. It will be the game of the cup. Two titans duelling together. My only hunch is that whoever wins this match will get to the final. Mexico1970 Brazil 1 England 0 Alan Mullery, wing-half On 1970: I felt going into the World Cup that we had a better team than the one that won it four years earlier. We had kept most of the squad together but had added people like Franny Lee and Terry Cooper. So we had a lot of confidence and, as good as they were, were not overly concerned about playing Brazil. Sir Alf gave me the easiest task on the day - marking Pele, whom I'd kept quiet in Rio the year before. But he was getting into his pomp and at one point used me to play a one-two, knocking the ball against my shins and then collecting the rebound. George Best has told me that he used to do that but it was the first time it had happened to me. Although Jairzinho got their winner, we matched them for most of the game and I thought we were unlucky to lose. On 2002: This England team have even less to fear than us. In David Beckham, Michael Owen and Rio Ferdinand, we have three of the best players at the World Cup and Brazil are not anything like 1970, probably the best team they ever had. So I see no reason why England shouldn't win. Paulo Cesar, forward On 1970: The match between England and Brazil was like a game of chess. Gerson strained a muscle and I was put on in his place. But I was well prepared. It was a game which required you to be patient, careful about the details. We won 1-0, but that was enough. In 1970 we were a cohesive group, we played collectively, it was completely different from what we have now. On 2002: Regardless of [coach Luiz Felipe] Scolari, who is useless, we can win because of the individual talent of Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Roberto Carlos and Denilson. Ronaldo is playing with a smile on his face, which is fundamental for us. We have to play without hurrying. We don't need to worry about our defence, because the English don't have much talent. The only one who is any good is Owen but he isn't as good as Ronaldo and, on top of that, is injured.
