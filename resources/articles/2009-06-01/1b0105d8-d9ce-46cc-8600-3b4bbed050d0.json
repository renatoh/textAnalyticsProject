Hills has saddled dozens of Group One winners, many of them ridden by one of his twin sons, Richard and Michael, but the latest success, with Ghanaati in the Coronation Stakes here yesterday, was, in many respects, the one that mattered most. Richard Hills, who rode the easy winner, and his brother Charlie, who welcomed Ghanaati back to the winner's enclosure, knew that their father was finally due to leave hospital yesterday after a five-week struggle against blood poisoning. \"I nearly lost my dad,\" the jockey said, \"but thank God we didn't. But what could you do to cheer him up? You can win a Coronation like we just did.\" Acceleration is the most potent weapon any racehorse can have and the race was won as soon as Hills booted Ghanaati clear more than a furlong from the line. Reggane ran on in the closing stages but was still two lengths adrift at the line, while Rainbow View was third. This was the fourth run of Ghanaati's career and the second Group One success, after her victory in the 1,000 Guineas last month. She broke the course record for a mile, too, although this dates back only to 2006, when the track re-opened after being realigned. \"I'm very proud,\" Richard Hills said. \"I've been wearing my heart on my sleeve a bit today, but the filly looked after me. She's quite laid-back at home, but when I picked her up at the two, she just took off, and I thought 'Wow'. And she can keep it going as well. It looked a very good race on paper and she's done it really well.\" Charlie Hills has been supervising the string at the Hills base in Lambourn during his father's stay in hospital and appears to have done a fine job, as the yard enjoyed a third winner of the week when Giganticus landed the Buckingham Palace Stakes. \"It has been fantastic to be given the opportunity to look after so many horses,\" he said. \"It's been a long five weeks, that's for sure, and I've been learning every day. Just recently, Dad's been on the phone more and geeing us up. I think he's on his way home now and the race will have been recorded, so I'm sure he'll be thrilled when he sees it.\" \"I don't know where she will go next, though obviously there will be discussions with [her owner] Sheikh Hamdan. She's in the Falmouth [at Newmarket next month] and the Nassau [at Glorious Goodwood], and she's going to get further, so there might be the Champion Stakes at the end of the year.\" Richard Hills was completing a double in the Sheikh's blue and white silks, having taken the Albany Stakes on Habaayib, who held off Lillie Langtry, said to be the best juvenile filly Aidan O'Brien has sent to Ascot, by a length and a half. The betting for this 22-runner event suggested that it was little more than a match between Lillie Langtry and Aegean, representing the American stable of Wesley Ward that has already had a double at the meeting. Aegean had beaten Jealous Again, the brilliant winner of the Queen Mary Stakes on Wednesday, in her last race, but she was agitated in the preliminaries, could never get clear from a high stall and then faded rapidly from more than a furlong out. Lillie Langtry ran with much more promise, but was still beaten fairly comfortably by Habaayib, who looks the type to keep on improving. \"She's got lots of scope and I said to Richard that today was not the be-all and end-all,\" said Ed Dunlop, Habaayib's trainer. \"She won't be over-raced this year. We toyed with the Queen Mary, but Richard was adamant about coming here and he was proved right.\" Habaayib can be backed at 16-1 for next year's 1,000 Guineas, while Lillie Langtry remains top-priced at 14-1 favourite with William Hill. Perfect Stride gave Ryan Moore and Sir Michael Stoute their second win of the week in the Wolferton Handicap and may now step up to Group Three company, while Mark Johnston's Holberg ran away with the Queen's Vase."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
