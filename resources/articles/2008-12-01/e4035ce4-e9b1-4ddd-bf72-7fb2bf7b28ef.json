Aha! The smoking gun! He'll have to resign in disgrace before he can even start his job, right? Uh, not quite. According to the Trib's (apparently) two sources, Rahmbo had two chats with gubernatorial aides, to convey a list of names Obama wanted Blago to choose from. (Interestingly, Jesse Jackson Jr. was not on Obama's list.) Anyway, it was according to this account a completely normal political conversation.
