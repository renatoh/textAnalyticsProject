Russian president Vladimir Putin, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and European president Jean-Claude Juncker heaped pressure on the two superpowers on Friday to settle their differences when they meet on the sidelines of the Osaka summit on Saturday. But financial markets fell across Asia on Friday amid growing fears that the talks will fail to break the logjam and see the US president carry out his threat of additional tariffs on Chinese goods. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3%, with weakness in Chinese equities weighing on the broader region. The Shanghai composite was down nearly 1% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock index was 0.55% lower. Trump has adopted a belligerent position ahead of the meeting, saying that China was desperate to reach a deal because its economy was \u201cgoing down the tubes\u201d. Xi hit back on Friday by saying that some developed countries were taking protectionist measures that are leading to trade conflicts and economic blockade - calling them the biggest risk of the increase in instability in the global economy. \u201cAll this is destroying the global trade order,\u201d he told leaders of the so-called Brics nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) in Osaka. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, urged G20 leaders to work together to defuse trade and political tensions, describing them as threats to global economic growth and stability. Abe, eager to avoid Japan\u2019s first G20 summit descending into rancour, said \u201cfree and open\u201d economies were critical to peace and prosperity, adding that no one would benefit from retaliatory moves over trade. Trump has also threatened Japan over what he calls its unfair advantage on trade. Abe, who hosted the US president on a lavish state visit last month, began the summit by handing him a document outlining Japanese carmakers\u2019 recent investments in the US. Trump said before his bilateral with Abe on Friday morning: \u201cI appreciate the fact that you\u2019re sending many automobile companies into Michigan, and Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and North Carolina \u2013 a lot of our states. I see they\u2019re building all over the United States, a lot of the great Japanese car companies \u2026 and other Japanese companies also. \u201cBut in particular, the car companies have been terrific. They\u2019re coming in and they\u2019re building magnificent plants. We haven\u2019t had that, and we very much appreciate it. \u201cSo we\u2019ll be discussing trade. We\u2019ll be discussing military. And we\u2019ll be discussing the purchase of a lot of military equipment by Japan, and we appreciate that.\u201d Putin echoed Xi\u2019s concerns at the same meeting, saying in a thinly veiled attack on the US that attempts to weaken the role of the World Trade Organisation \u2013 as Trump has suggested he wants to do \u2013 were \u201ccounter-productive\u201d. The current situation in the global economy was worrying, he added, as global trade was feeling the effect of \u201cprotectionism [and] politically motivated restrictions\u201d. Ahead of talks with Modi, Trump softened his warnings about tariffs on India and said \u201cwe\u2019re going to have some very big things to announce \u2026 with India in terms of trade\u201d. But that did not stop Modi joining the chorus of warnings about \u201cone-sided decisions\u201d that jeopardised the balanced development of the global economy for all countries. Juncker said the trade relations between China and the US were \u201cdifficult\u201d and were causing a slowdown of the global economy. Michael McCarthy of CMC markets in Sydney said that there was nevertheless some optimism that there would be a step forward in the trade negotiations, which broke down in May at the last minute. However, he warned that despite the relative calm, the financial markets\u2019 VIX volatility measure, known as the \u201cfear index\u201d, spiked to above 16%. \u201cThis is a significant increase on the April low near 11%,\u201d he said, \u201cand shows investor fear is on the rise.\u201d Hannah Anderson, JP Morgan Asset Management global market strategist, said the concern was that the markets had \u201cseen this movie before\u201d. \u201cChina and the US talk, leaks from policymakers on both sides encourage speculation we are close to a deal, things fall apart, the US presses forward with higher tariffs and markets express their displeasure with corrections and higher volatility.\u201d The US dollar, which has fallen in the wake of signals from the US Federal Reserve that it will begin cutting interest rates soon, was flat against a basket of six major rivals. The Australian dollar, seen as a proxy for the Chinese economy, rose above US70c. In commodity markets, trade worries continued to weigh on oil, with the global benchmark Brent crude down 0.56% to $66.18 per barrel. It was better for gold though as the traditional safe haven for investors rose to trade at $1,420.35 per ounce, up 0.79%.
