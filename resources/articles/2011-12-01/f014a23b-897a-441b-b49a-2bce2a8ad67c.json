Among them was the Cumbria trainer Elliot Cooper, who was the youngest trainer ever granted a licence when he started his business in April 2009. Cooper was found by the BHA to have passed inside information to Richard Bowe, his cousin, in relation to Masafi before that horse was twice unplaced in June 2009. Bowe was found to have laid Masafi to lose on both occasions, risking around \u00a33,000 for a profit of \u00a31,200. Prior to the first of the two races, Bowe had not used his Betfair account for 16 months but deposited \u00a31,500 an hour before the race was due to start. Cooper protested his innocence before the BHA but was not believed, though the disciplinary panel confined its verdict to the races involving Masafi and found there was no proof that Cooper had also passed information during his time working for Jonjo O'Neill. Bowe, who refused to cooperate with the inquiry, was warned off indefinitely, with a recommendation that no application for the lifting of his ban be considered for 10 years. The panel expressed sympathy for Cooper, in light of his youth and precarious financial position, and imposed a ban of 12 months. Also banned as the result of a separate investigation were Peter and Nick Gold, among the 11 found guilty last week of being part of a corrupt conspiracy to profit from the laying of horses. Having considered written submissions from the Golds, the BHA banned them for five and seven years respectively. Greg Fairley, one of the jockeys banned as part of the same investigation, will not have to repay the money spent on him by a jockeys' retraining scheme, it was announced, despite the 12-year ban he was given last week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
