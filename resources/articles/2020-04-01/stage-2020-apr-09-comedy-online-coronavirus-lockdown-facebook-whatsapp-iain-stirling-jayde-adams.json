We\u2019re like that as well!\u201d He laughs at the relief it brings. \u201cYou go, thank God!\u201d The coronavirus lockdown means it could be months until standups are able to hear the roar of laughter in comedy clubs again. Meanwhile, many are making the most of online platforms. Stirling, whose UK tour dates have been postponed, is live-streaming to his fans on Twitch, which principally involves chatting about gaming while he plays Fifa. Many of us are only just discovering networks such as Zoom and Houseparty during confinement, but Stirling was an early adopter and uses Twitch when working away from home on Love Island. \u201cYou know in the American local news there\u2019s those articles about the guy from Arizona who has built a zombie apocalypse bunker and everyone\u2019s like, \u2018What have you built that for?\u2019\u201d When the worst happens, he says, everyone wants their own bunker. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel about comedy and Twitch.\u201d Some have subscribed to his channel for so long that \u201cyou get to know people and what they\u2019re up to\u201d. He ends sessions with a raid, which sends his viewers to another live channel. \u201cI\u2019ll find someone with fewer than 10 viewers and a decent size webcam. Then I chuck 500-odd people into their chat. Sometimes they\u2019re playing League of Legends with their mates and resent it.\u201d He laughs. \u201cGenerally, it\u2019s good.\u201d It may not be the same as performing to a sold-out comedy crowd but Twitch \u201cscratches the itch\u201d when Stirling is missing standup. His partner, the presenter Laura Whitmore, \u201chas noticed I\u2019ve stopped doing material at her in the kitchen, which is good\u201d. For some, online comedy offers escapism during confinement. Alexis Strum\u2019s new podcast, The Funny Women Survival Guide, is specifically designed to uplift. Strum introduces herself as a writer and performer, then adds newly discovered roles as home-schooler and hairdresser that will be relatable for many. With subjects in the first episode including being upstaged by your pet on conference calls, she describes her podcast as an attempt \u201cto cheer up the nation\u201d. Taskmaster\u2019s Alex Horne is challenging the nation with Home Tasking, a series of eccentric assignments \u2013 \u201cThrow a piece of paper into a bin spectacularly\u201d, \u201cMake the best dancing elephant\u201d \u2013 to keep families entertained. Participants share videos of their attempts and a modest prize is promised. (\u201cSomething nice,\u201d says Horne. \u201cNot a car.\u201d) Standup Philip Simon had gigs and a TV commercial cancelled because of the crisis, so to give himself \u2013 and others with kids \u2013 \u201ca little focus\u201d, he established School\u2019s Out Comedy Club. Simon invites children to submit jokes, which he says develops their creative writing skills, and he performs them to camera. Some children submit videos of themselves telling gags. The next episode is dedicated to the NHS so \u201cdoctor, doctor\u201d jokes are welcome. Standup Kae Kurd has a nice line in funny videos about stressed dads cutting their kids\u2019 hair and helping with homework. Kurd doesn\u2019t have children \u2013 he is in isolation with his brothers \u2013 but he has a lot of friends with kids and knows what they are going through. \u201cIt\u2019s funny seeing how parents are dealing with this. At first they\u2019re like, \u2018The structure is really important.\u2019 After a week, it\u2019s like, \u2018Can you just stay in your room and not accidentally stab yourself?\u2019\u201d Kurd has been prolific at sharing homemade funnies but says standups in the UK haven\u2019t tended to focus on making material specially for online. \u201cWe\u2019re similar to New York comics in the sense that we can make a living off gigs. But if you look at comics from LA, they have to work on web series and podcasts, too.\u201d He is sharing videos on social media to build his audience, but it\u2019s also a coping mechanism. Plus, he doesn\u2019t want to be doing material about the lockdown when it\u2019s over and he goes on tour. \u201cI might as well get these ideas out while I can when we\u2019re all going through it. The last thing people will want to hear afterwards is, \u201cRemember corona?\u2019 I can already imagine the jokes: \u2018I was self-isolating, which is like The Hunger Games but with my cat \u2026\u2019 Get away from me, man. I don\u2019t want to hear any of that crap.\u201d Creating viral comedy is \u201ca distinctly different skill\u201d to standup, he says. If he has a good idea, \u201cI just try it and see how people receive it. You will know from the views and engagement levels what works better.\u201d It\u2019s an accelerated process of preparing new material to try at a gig \u2013 you can film instantly at home and get an immediate response online. Viewers are visiting many comedians\u2019 homes during the lockdown. Jayde Adams is hosting a weekly half-hour \u201ccouch cabaret\u201d on Facebook Live from her living room (a treasure trove of fabulousness with a plush blue sofa). Her first show included singing sisters Flo &amp; Joan harmonising through isolation, Rose Matafeo doing a Phantom of the Opera number with a pair of glove puppets, and Steve Bugeja\u2019s predictions for life after lockdown. (\u201cDogs will get excited when we leave for work, not when we get home.\u201d) Adams featured in a sketch imagining the unfortunate effects of Joe Wicks\u2019s stomping exercises for his neighbours. The show was watched by audiences around the world, from Adams\u2019 home town of Bristol to the US, where her Amazon Prime show, Serious Black Jumper, is a hit and led to a surge of interest on TikTok. Adams says she\u2019s fortunate because, unlike a lot of comedians on the circuit, she has television and radio work, too, and doesn\u2019t rely purely on live shows. She acknowledges that standup online can be very difficult to pull off without an audience in the room because you usually \u201cride their laughter like a surfer\u201d. Her cabaret gives a platform to comedians, musicians and dancers who may not otherwise have the technical knowhow to share work and successfully find audiences online. She decided to put together a variety bill for locked-in audiences because that\u2019s the entertainment she remembers watching at home with her family as a child \u2013 though you\u2019d imagine that those TV cabaret shows didn\u2019t feature, as hers does, a man named Pudding wearing a gimp suit. Pudding is Adams\u2019 boyfriend, comedian Rich Wilson. They are sharing their home with another comedian, Paul Sweeney, and film and edit the show themselves. The trio also have an online pub quiz and gin club. Kiri Pritchard-McLean is compering Saturday night gigs on Zoom, with proceeds being split between performers and charity. The lineups combine established names and \u201cgems from the circuit\u201d, with tickets being sold for \u00a32 or \u00a310 if you want a \u201cfront row\u201d ticket, which allows you to share your screen and chat to her. She points out that it is a comedy bill curated by a comedian rather than a producer, so her bills will reflect a wider pool of talent from the comedy circuit than a TV producer\u2019s might. Even BBC regulars such as Have I Got News for You and The Mash Report are bringing together hosts and guests from their lounges and spare rooms. Aspiring comedy producer Andy Ash has been quick to develop his own format, which he describes as \u201ca social distancing panel show with isolated comedians\u201d. WhatsApp\u2019ening is hosted by Mark O\u2019Sullivan from Lee and Dean, and its panelists must separate fact from fiction. The game is played via a WhatsApp group chat and the loser forfeits control of their WhatsApp so the winner can send messages to whoever they like. Episode one featured Stevie Martin (sporting a stylish eyepatch due to an infection), Jacob Hawley, Nic Sampson and Lauren Pattison, who is in lockdown at her childhood home. Some of Ash\u2019s guests had Edinburgh fringe shows lined up and he recognises that the festival\u2019s cancellation is an \u201cimmeasurable blow\u201d for many comedians. He fears the climate threatens artistic aspirations \u201cparticularly if you come from a poorer background\u201d. He says that, as well as donating to funds for freelance creatives, it can also be productive to \u201cinvest in something creative and funny\u201d. Ash became involved in comedy production as a way of dealing with grief after his mother died in 2016. \u201cI decided I wanted to be a part of making people happy, bringing laughter to them,\u201d he says. During lockdown, \u201cnow more than ever we need something to laugh at, to be joyous about\u201d. The nimble world of online comedy content, which can be swiftly created, widely shared and is vital as clubs remain closed, could introduce a new wave of comedians to audiences. Ash points to the boom in bedroom music production in the 90s and how it created a revolution. \u201cMaybe this could be a moment for comedy, too. I certainly hope so.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
