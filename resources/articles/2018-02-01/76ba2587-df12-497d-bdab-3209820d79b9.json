Senior leaders of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) met Zuma over the weekend to ask him to step down. Local media reported that the 75-year-old president, who is battling corruption allegations, refused. The party\u2019s national working committee, one of its highest decision-making bodies, met on Monday in Johannesburg. After seven hours of deliberations, it issued a statement saying the ANC\u2019s national executive committee (NEC), a larger and more senior body, would meet on Wednesday to consider the next step. One possibility is that Zuma will be ordered to resign, though this may raise significant constitutional issues. According to ANC rules, all members \u2013 even elected officials \u2013 fulfil their functions according to the will of the party. The premature departure of Zuma, whose second five-year term is due to expire next year, will consolidate the power of Cyril Ramaphosa, who was elected leader of the ANC in December. Supporters of Ramaphosa, a multimillionaire businessman who is seen as the standard bearer of the reformist wing of the party, say it is essential that Zuma is sidelined as early as possible to allow the ANC to regroup before campaigning starts in earnest for elections in 2019. Adriaan Basson, a senior South African journalist, wrote: \u201cZuma has played all his cards and is now at open war with Ramaphosa and his supporters.\u201d Zuma had led the ANC since 2007 and has been South Africa\u2019s president since 2009. His tenure in both posts has been controversial, with a series of corruption scandals undermining the image and legitimacy of the party that led South Africans to freedom in 1994 and has ruled ever since. The ANC still dominates the political landscape in South Africa but its popularity has been dented by a failure to transform the lives of the country\u2019s poor. The party lost control of several cities in municipal elections in 2016 and may be forced into a coalition after the 2019 vote. The party\u2019s top decision-making body is split between supporters of Ramaphosa and Zuma. Supporters and opponents of the president briefly clashed outside the ANC\u2019s headquarters in Johannesburg on Monday morning. Statements from senior office holders have made clear in recent days that factional rifts within the ANC itself remain deep despite calls for unity. Paul Mashatile, the ANC treasurer general, told reporters on Friday that the president should step down. \u201cThere should be a change of guard. You can\u2019t have two centres of power. The best possible way is if the state president exits,\u201d Mashatile said. Ace Magashule, the ANC secretary general and a Zuma loyalist, said the president would still address the opening of parliament in Cape Town on Thursday. The Democratic Alliance, a prominent opposition party, called for the address to be postponed. The Economic Freedom Fighters, a second opposition party, has called for a fresh no-confidence motion, which will be heard on 22 February. Zuma narrowly survived a no-confidence vote in August, when some ANC parliamentarians voted with the opposition. However this will be the first since Ramaphosa took over the leadership of the party. The NEC is the only ANC body with the formal power to order Zuma to resign Following the national working committee\u2019s decision on Monday, the NEC may recommend rapid action against the president. This could still prevent Zuma from giving the state of the nation address on Thursday, experts say. The timing and form of any move will depend on the shifting and unpredictable dynamics of a complex struggle for power within the uppermost ranks of the ANC. In 2008 Thabo Mbeki stood down as president a year before the end of his term after the ruling party formally requested his resignation over allegations he misused his power. His deputy then took power, until Zuma led the party to another victory in elections in 2009 and became president. \u201cZuma\u2019s days in the office can definitely be counted in weeks, not months,\u201d said Jakkie Cilliers, an analyst with the Institute for Security Studies, a Pretoria-based thinktank. Susan Booysen, professor of politics at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, said the president could potentially hold on for longer, though any delay would damage the ANC. \u201cThe ANC is trying to project this image of a party with a new drive and momentum but this is such a mess-up. Any recent gains are not irreversible even if the inexorable overall direction of travel is clear and Zuma has his back to the wall,\u201d Booysen said. As president, Ramaphosa will have to balance the need to reassure foreign investors and local businesses against the intense popular demand for dramatic measures to address South Africa\u2019s deep problems. The 68-year-old former trade union leader has said South Africa is coming out of a \u201cperiod of uncertainty, a period of darkness, and getting into a new phase\u201d. The ANC will also face a long period of adjustment, and introspection. \u201cZuma will leave a legacy of disbelief and embarrassment and a sense of \u2018how could we let this happen?\u2019. There is so much disrepute from this era that it is difficult to contemplate,\u201d said Booysen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
