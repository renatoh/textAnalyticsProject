You can see what he means: comedian doesn\u2019t begin to cover the talents of a man who composed the musical Matilda, then moved to Hollywood to write and direct his own $100m animated movie. That project was cancelled after four years\u2019 work, triggering a depressed Minchin\u2019s return to Australia and \u2013 indirectly \u2013 this new tour, his first for eight years. It is in many ways a triumphant comeback, a three-hour spectacular tracing the story of Minchin\u2019s life in \u201cold songs, new songs and fuck you songs\u201d. It comes with a guarantee to raise the roof \u2013 if not with as many laughs as one might have wished for. I feel churlish saying so because Minchin lays it on thick here, with a slick seven-piece band and set engineered to make the room shake. It can\u2019t be faulted as an onslaught of entertainment, even if one wonders whether Minchin\u2019s songs \u2013 many of which depend on linguistic dexterity for their effect \u2013 are best served by this push-the-boat out approach. You can see the attraction to the rock\u2019n\u2019roll nerd himself, whose tracks always aspired to the condition of rock opera. That was part of the joke \u2013 but it\u2019s a part that evaporates when the fantasy becomes reality and Minchin\u2019s puns are subsumed beneath the wall of sound. That\u2019s not an issue at the start of the show, which finds our kohl-eyed, big-haired host alone at his piano performing old favourite, F Sharp, and that torrent of wordplay and atheist sarcasm, Thank You God. There\u2019s some anecdotes about his early years as a cash-strapped musician and actor, a period we might designate (after his fellow ginger Simply Red) as: money\u2019s too tight, Tim Minchin. As if to celebrate that those days are gone, the curtain then drops in a blaze of lights to reveal his backing band, and the register changes from intimate to grandiose. There follows a brassy reworking of If I Didn\u2019t Have You, while his ode to cheese is given a hyperactive makeover. New songs include bittersweet ballad Leaving LA and I\u2019ll Take Lonely Tonight, a song about resisting sexual temptation that flirts with a humblebrag and ends up being lovely. Lowlights include a lecture about confirmation bias and the lack of empathy between today\u2019s siloed social tribes \u2013 all good points, but not novel and made with a heavy hand to tee up Minchin\u2019s earnest song on the subject, 15 Minutes. But there are many highlights, among them a droll indoors standup section deriving from John Mayer\u2019s single Your Body is a Wonderland, and a closing number introduced as Minchin\u2019s effort to emulate Bob Dylan. Its dissimilarity to Dylan seems to be the joke until this violently intemperate number persuades you that it may well be the perfect (petty, plaintive) protest song for our hostile times. The encore offers the bonus of When I Grow Up from Matilda, a gem of a song that sparkles a little less when performed this stridently. I\u2019d rather it had been handled with the light touch of Carry You, an a capella tribute to Minchin\u2019s recently deceased tour manager. Here, as elsewhere, it feels as if Minchin\u2019s put a lot of himself into a show that delivers on autobiography, opinion and big, brash musicality \u2013 if a little less so on comedy. \u2022At Eventim Apollo, London, 12-14 November. Then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
