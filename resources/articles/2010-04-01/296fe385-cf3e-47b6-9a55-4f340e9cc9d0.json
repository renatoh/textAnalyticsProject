The decision is also a relief to Gordon Brown, who needed a rail strike at the start of the general election campaign like he needs a hole in the head. This strike was neither a good way of running a railway, nor the right way of ensuring that staff grievances are properly addressed. There is a lot wrong about Britain's railways and the public is often quite sympathetic to the workers' case. But the leader of the rail workers' RMT union, Bob Crow, is much too trigger-happy with industrial threats and confrontation at the public's expense. He has another one brewing on the London Underground as well as others on the railways too. The two sides should take this opportunity to get back round the table and negotiate a solution. Mr Crow issued a characteristically belligerent response to Mrs Justice Sharp's decision in the high court yesterday afternoon to grant an injunction to Network Rail halting the strike because of balloting irregularities by the RMT. The courts, he claimed, had launched an attack on the whole trade union movement by their decision. This is an exaggeration. No union that conducts its ballots properly according to the reasonable requirements of the law \u2013 as most do, and as the RMT has done in the past \u2013 would be in danger of being injuncted. Nevertheless, the court's decision, especially in the wake of a similar ruling in the case of the BA cabin crew dispute last Christmas, does raise real concerns, not just about the way such ballots are conducted but also about the way they are now being targeted by employers and the judiciary. Bringing the trade unions under the rule of law was one of the great struggles of the 20th century. It is right that strike action requires a ballot before it takes place. Those ballots therefore have to be properly conducted. Yet the practical problems of conducting ballots in industries where workers are not always in the same place are genuine. Perhaps union record-keeping is at fault in some cases. However, if every election or ballot in which there are cases of bad practice was to be invalidated, democracy would soon become a laughing stock, and something worse would replace it. Employers seem increasingly ready to seize on individual cases of bad ballot practice to negate the entire exercise, even when it is clear, as it was in the BA case, that the vote was overwhelming. The courts need to show some common sense in such cases so that the law retains the respect it needs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
