Most people associate brands with a famous name or a well-known logo, such as the Nike swoosh, Adidas's three stripes or Ferrari's prancing horse. But brands symbolise so much more. They should reflect the ethos, personality and values of the whole organisation. A brand is an experience, the mere mention of which will immediately trigger a host of images, thoughts and expectations in the consumer. Put simply, strong brands sell. The power of brands is undeniable and aligning two strong brands with each other can provide even greater reach and effectiveness. Sports brands increasingly recognised the examples of other consumer brands and subsequently applied such techniques to their own businesses, communicating more directly and in a more engaging way with their target markets. Sports brands began to understand the need to interact with their customers in a creative way. From designing engaging packaging to displaying absorbing point-of-sale materials, sports brand have gradually created a climate whereby consumers can now live the brand themselves, shopping at stores such as Niketown. Probably the first individual phenomenon of sports branding was Michael Jordan - a genius of the basketball court and the first global sports superstar, whose face adorned dozens of products and whose ability inspired his own range of clothing and footwear under the Nike Air Jordan brand. Such was his allure, his standing as a brand became bigger than that of the team he played for, the Chicago Bulls. Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player - all great golfers - won many majors between them. But none generated the interest, loyalty and financial gains enjoyed by the current world number one, Tiger Woods, who has become a brand in his own right. The likes of Nike have been quick to build on his unique talents, to the extent that everyone - children and adults alike - now wants to be Tiger Woods, as the advertising stated so succinctly. Tiger Woods is synonymous with the Nike brand and vice versa. It is a mutually beneficial relationship. While every drive or putt that Woods takes is screened around the globe, relaying numerous Nike swooshes that adorn his baseball bat, clothing and shoes, Nike in turn can associate itself with the Tiger's ore values of sportsmanship, youth and, most of all, victory. In the same way, David Beckham's ability as a footballer, combined with his good looks and glamorous lifestyle have been enticing for Adidas, Police sunglasses and Brylcreem, among others, who pay him millions to endorse their brands. Such is Beckham's individual clout in the branding and marketing arena, he spent months wrangling with Manchester United - one of the world's biggest brands - over his personal image rights, before eventually signing a lucrative contract with his club worth an estimated \u00a390,000 a week, \u00a320,000 of which is for image rights alone. During my career I have worked on sports brands such as Nike and Reebok, as well as non-sports brands, including the creative and strategic development of the Conservative Party's torch identity, Johnnie Walker's \"striding man\" icon and Universal Studios' globe brand identity. I therefore believe that any investment in branding should be made in pursuance of a well-thought-out strategy, where money is spent for the right reasons. But taking a planned approach to developing, nurturing and sustaining sports brands won't end the growing conflict between the increasingly incompatible interests of the individual's brand and his/her team's brand - or indeed the world's top cricketers and the ICC. It's not yet clear which of the two brand entities will win, or indeed whether or not the two can find a way of profitably and effectively co-existing. However, what is certain is that there'll be more legal wrangling and bruised egos before this matter is finally resolved. Has the phrase \"it's only a game\" ever sounded so ironic?
