With that, Allardyce was gone. It had been a trying afternoon, one that offered him none of the certainty evinced by Bilic about Sunderland\u2019s survival prospects. Allardyce\u2019s return to east London had been greeted with apathy by his former public and most of the fare that ensued inspired a similar feeling. Yet his side squandered enough chances to take a late point and the overriding sense afterwards was one of disquiet. \u201cThe massive disappointment is we know we should have got a result, and with the position we\u2019re in it was imperative we came away with at least a point,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made life extremely hard for ourselves by not getting one. You have to be encouraged by the performance, but for them not to convert any of their chances is a real concern to me. Losing that today is difficult to take, very difficult.\u201d His body language was downbeat and that seemed to be overdoing things slightly. Sunderland\u2019s cause is far from lost and, on current form, a home fixture against Crystal Palace on Tuesday appears an ideal pick-me-up. Jermain Defoe and Jack Rodwell, the latter twice, should certainly have buried presentable opportunities in the second half but it was tempting to wonder whether Allardyce, with his clear sense of pride at the foundations he established in four years at Upton Park, had invested more in this fixture than he was prepared to let on. \u201cI think the lads know that without me saying it,\u201d he said when asked whether the desire to win on his old turf had featured in his team talk, and it evidently hurt that the occasion had fallen flat. West Ham\u2019s rise under Bilic underlines the parties\u2019 contrasting directions of travel. Michail Antonio\u2019s well-taken first-half winner, aided by generous defending from Patrick van Aanholt, keeps them firmly in the contest for European places, even if this was not their most convincing display. They have tended to find life tougher against the lesser sides than those near the top but, for Bilic, any victory is a sign that his team are handling increased expectations. \u201cThe pressure is there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a little bit the victims of our own success. Some of the press might have thought, \u2018Sunderland, it should be easy\u2019, but no way. They beat Manchester United and drew at Anfield. But it comes because of our points and performances so far.\u201d That combination means continental football at the Olympic Stadium \u2013 and not of the type that saw FC Lusitans, Birkirkara and Astra Giurgiu usher in Upton Park\u2019s final season \u2013 cannot be discounted and Bilic was content to allow such thoughts to run. \u201cIf I say \u2018we don\u2019t have a chance\u2019, then a lot of people will think I don\u2019t believe in my team,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I say \u2018yeah, we\u2019ve got a chance\u2019, then I\u2019ve become big-headed or whatever. I\u2019ll leave you to make a calculation.\u201d West Ham\u2019s progress has already been such that no mathematics could really come up with an answer unsatisfactory to Bilic; how things add up for Allardyce between now and May is far less clear.
