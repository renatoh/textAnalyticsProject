The Barnett government has withdrawn all funding for the service, equating to a loss of about $140,000. Combined with the federal government\u2019s decision to cease funding for all environmental defenders offices from June 30, it leaves the EDO in WA with a $250,000 shortfall on its annual operating costs of about $300,000. Attorney general Michael Mischin has blamed the state\u2019s poor financial position for the cut. In a statement, Mischin said the government needed to focus on providing services for those \u201cmost in need\u201d in \u201cthese times of financial stringency.\u201d \u201cSupporting the EDO does not take priority to providing people with assistance with issues relating to their employment contracts or those seeking legal assistance in matters of criminal or family law, or domestic violence cases,\u201d Mischin said. He did not comment on suggestions the cut was a response to the EDO\u2019s involvement in cases opposing government policy. But critics of the decision have suggested the funding cut may have been politically motivated, pointing to the EDO\u2019s work in hotly contested environmental issues like the shark cull, James Price Point gas development, and the Roe 8 highway extension. Lawyers from the EDO overturned the Barnett government\u2019s approval of the $45m James Price Point gas development in the supreme court in 2013. That case, which was run on behalf of the Goolarabooloo people, pointed out conflicts of interest on the Environmental Protection Agency board. More recently, the EDO provided legal assistance to No WA Shark Cull in an application to access the jaws of two great white sharks killed as part of the state\u2019s serious threat policy. Piers Verstegen, from the Conservation Council of WA, says the funding cut was part of a \u201csystematic attack\u201d on advocacy groups and outlets that provide environmental criticism. \u201cThe EDO is an extremely important organisation in our community and it brings scrutiny to environmental issues, often where government make bad decisions or go wrong in relation to environmental management,\u201d he told the ABC this week. \u201cI think the government\u2019s keen to remove that scrutiny.\u201d The Greens senator for WA, Scott Ludlum, accused the state government of \u201cintentionally targeting the people who have the courage to stand up to them.\u201d Henry Jackson, a Perth-based barrister who specialises in environmental and planning law, said organisations like the EDO played a vital oversight role and the funding loss was of \u201cgrave concern\u201d. \u201cTo deprive the EDO of funds is to deprive the community of its right to that information and advice and thereby to diminish the checks on executive power,\u201d Jackson said. Principal solicitor Patrick Pearlman said the EDO was now reliant on donations and grants to make up the funding shortfall, and he said it was not clear how long the office would be able to remain open. Total donations in 2013-14 came to $37,000, less than a fifth of that year\u2019s wages bill. The EDO has also launched a crowdsourcing campaign, but as of Thursday it had only drummed up $845 of its $250,000 GoFundMe goal. Among the donors were Sea Shepherd managing director Jeff Hansen and No WA Shark Cull founder Natalie Banks. Opposition environment spokesman Chris Tallentire said it was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d to pull funding from the already struggling organisation. \u201cThe EDO\u2019s work is vital to environmental protection in Western Australia; on a tiny budget it has used legal avenues to argue the case for the environment,\u201d Tallentire said. \u201cMassively wealthy resources companies, property developers and other rich vested interests will be delighted the Barnett government is making life even easier for them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
