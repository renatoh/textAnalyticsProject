In 1966 he moved to Britain, where he had his first solo exhibition in 1969. During the 1980s he was a tutor at Goldsmiths College, where he taught many of the emerging Young British Artists. His work has been exhibited all over the world, and his latest show, Michael Craig-Martin: Sculpture, is at Gagosian, Britannia Street, London, until 3 August. 1. Art Palazzo Grimani, Venice I\u2019ve just come back from Venice, and of course the Biennale is on, but this is the thing I saw that most overwhelmed me. It\u2019s a stunning 16th-century palazzo and has two exhibitions \u2013 one ancient and one modern \u2013 in the same place. The first is a beautiful collection of abstract paintings by Helen Frankenthaler, from 1952 to 1992. There is also a room called the Tribuna: it\u2019s full of classical arches, alcoves, niches and pedestals, with more than 100 classical sculptures of different gods and goddesses, in different scales. You will never see a more extraordinary place. 2. Architecture Louvre Abu Dhabi I was recently in Abu Dhabi for a conference, and though I had read and heard about the Louvre, I was unprepared for how absolutely fantastic it is. It\u2019s a very low, gentle dome, like a geometric metal grid in several layers, so that light filters through. It\u2019s open, so if it rains, the water will come through. The materials, the proportion and just everything about the interior is beautifully done \u2013 then you go through and come out into a plaza with water on all sides. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been to a museum that was more beautiful. 3. Documentary Amazing Grace I was taken by a friend, knowing nothing about the film, and I was floored. At the peak of her power in 1972, Aretha Franklin decided to make a recording of authentic gospel music, with an audience, in a Baptist church. Sydney Pollack filmed it, but bizarrely didn\u2019t use clapperboards, and after it was filmed it was impossible to match the sound recording with the visuals. Now producer Alan Elliott has been able to do it using digital technology, and it\u2019s extraordinary \u2013 it gives you the sense that you\u2019re there. I found myself weeping through half of it. 4. TV Killing Eve, BBC One I didn\u2019t watch this originally, then I saw it won all the awards, so naturally I got curious and watched it on BBC iPlayer. What an amazing series: the characters are so special, so eccentric \u2013 every single person is such an individual. The confrontations between the psychopath and her pursuer, and their bizarre bonding \u2013 you\u2019re constantly waiting to see what\u2019s going to happen next, and it\u2019s never what you expect. It seemed very contemporary and very stylish, and I found myself watching four or five episodes at a time. 5. Radio Gloomsbury, BBC Radio 4 This is the funniest thing on radio. It\u2019s supposed to be about Vita Sackville-West at Sissinghurst and her circle of friends, and their names have been slightly altered: she becomes Vera Sackcloth-Vest, Virginia Woolf is Ginny Fox. In one episode, the Prince of Wales comes to see the garden at \u201cSizzlinghurst\u201d and he\u2019s making a pass at Vita, then two unexpected guests arrive \u2013 Gertrude Stein and Wallis Simpson \u2013 and he quickly drops Vita to go off with Wallis. The cast, including Miriam Margolyes , John Sessions and Alison Steadman, are fabulous and clearly having so much fun. It\u2019s simply marvellous. 6. Restaurant Harry\u2019s Dolci, Venice When I was in Venice I was invited to dinner here. The Dolci has a beautiful terrace, but it was too cold, so we went inside, which you wouldn\u2019t normally do. It was quite a large room, very classic: elegant but not fancy, with quite simple decor. The restaurant is extraordinarily expensive and has an amazing reputation. Very often places that have such reputations are not so wonderful in reality, but everything we had was impeccably done. I\u2019ve had sea bass many times, but this was the best I\u2019ve ever had."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
