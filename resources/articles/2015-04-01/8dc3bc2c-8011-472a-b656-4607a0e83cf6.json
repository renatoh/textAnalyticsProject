The renowned M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt, who has worked at Bayern since 1977, released a statement saying: \u201cAfter Bayern Munich\u2019s game in the Champions League against Porto ... the medical team were made responsible for the defeat.\u201d The other three members walking out were M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt\u2019s son, Kilian, as well as Peter Ueblacker and Lutz H\u00e4nsel. Bayern Munich seemed to be unaware of the development on Thursday night. \u201cWe have not heard about this press release, so we can\u2019t comment on it,\u201d said their press manager Markus H\u00f6rwick. M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt has quit once before, after a disagreement with J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann in 2008, but returned as soon as the former Tottenham player had left the club. Last season, M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt reportedly had a disagreement with Pep Guardiola over the treatment of the injured Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara. Bayern were missing several key players against Porto, including Franck Rib\u00e9ry, Arjen Robben, David Alaba, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Javi Mart\u00ednez and Medhi Benatia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
