Please don't read on if you haven't seen episode two \u2013 and if you've seen further in the series, please be aware that other viewers may not have done. Pilot and We'll Always Have Paris To call Pan Am \"the Mad Men of the skies\" is a bit like calling A Touch Of Frost \"The Wire of the Midlands\" or SpongeBob SquarePants \"The Sopranos of the sea\". Mad Men is nuanced, smart, and crafted with precision; Pan Am is drawn on the back of an old printout with a fistful of mismatched crayons. That said, it's a soapy treat, and it may do feminism in broad, shiny brushstrokes, but it's still a women-centric drama that doesn't reduce everything to matrimony or motherhood. And it looks nice. Here are our stewardesses, and what they're up to in this opening double-bill. Maggie Christina Ricci's Maggie corrects her friend/boyfriend when he incorrectly attributes a Hegel quote to Marx. She wears black. She listens to jazz. She's a bohemian! She's also a top-class \"purser\", or head stewardess, who is so good that she is worth flying in from Manhattan on a helicopter just so she can be the boss of this aircraft. She's a leftie, too, suggesting, during the Bay of Pigs evacuation flashback, that \"we did try to invade his [Castro's] country\", after all. In the second episode, she protests against the stewardesses being weighed before they're allowed to fly, then is assaulted by a boorish businessman, and makes First Officer Ted feel like the buffoon he is for allowing the man to try it again. Maggie is the Spice Girls of Pan Am and although her girl power is day-glo, I like it. Kate Kate not only has to deal with her new, permanent bring-your-sister-to-work day, she also has to be a secret CIA agent, and deal with her overbearing mother, too. No wonder she looks stressed. Having successfully passed her secret recruitment test, mere months after liberating sister Laura from a potentially loveless marriage, she finds herself trying to bond with her mother in Paris, over a passport. It's touching, but she's better when she's being a hard-nosed international agent of espionage. I wonder what she did to become the \"black sheep of the family\" \u2013 it seems like there's more than just running off to fly. Laura Laura is a looker who finds herself on the cover of Life magazine, caught in a moment of happiness, as she graduates from Pan Am school. After running out on her wedding day, she joins the airline to seek adventure, despite her mother's disapproval \u2013 though her appearance on Life magazine (they always say \"Life magazine\") eventually makes her choice of a career at least semi-acceptable to her family. There's a nice scene in Paris with Greg, her estranged fianc\u00e9, when she asks him to let her go, because he can't really compete with Kilimanjaro. Colette Another example of the not-so-subtle ways of this show: a French stewardess who's also a mistress called Colette. Colette is excited to bump into an amour from Rome on a flight, until it turns out that he's married with a child, and his wife has something to say about her sleeping with him. The second episode seems to be setting up a romance with Captain Dean, though he's still pining after Bridget, which is fine, but it would be nice to see the one who's implied to be less chaste actually being unchaste, if only for a while. These girls all appear to be very well-behaved in the bedroom, so far, at least. No sexual revolution here yet. Bridget Bridget only exists in flashbacks in the pilot, where we eventually learn that she was a CIA agent, and Kate is replacing her. Her beautiful English ways have charmed Captain Dean into proposing, but she's suddenly MIA \u2013 we learn later that she's suffering the dual humiliation of being deactivated and sent to live in Missouri. In Paris, she warns Kate that she can escape, if she likes. But this is escape for her. And that means she will be a very good spy. The men The pilots aren't what this show is about. They're prone to saying sexist things that they don't realise are sexist (Ted) or doing a bit of blue-eyed pining over beautiful stewardesses (Dean). This show also seems at pains to point out that they're a bit inadequate compared to the women, because they aren't trilingual, and pull funny faces when they are faced with another language. It looks like Dean will get over Bridget and under Colette; will lothario Ted get together with Maggie, now she's made an effort to show him the error of his ways? Notes and observations \u2022 In the pilot particularly, the music is incessant. And if there are any more songs about flying or travel from the 60s, expect to hear them. Perhaps we could have big-band covers of Fly by Nicki Minaj? On A Plain by Nirvana (plane. Oh never mind)? \u2022 Where are all the cigarettes? Wasn't flying in the 60s supposed to be a smoky haven? \u2022 There's a strong emphasis on how educated these stewardesses are. They all have a degree and seem to speak three languages. But they also have to stop work when they're married, or reach 32, or rip their tights, or put on a pound too many. Sexism! \u2022 The rousing empowerment speeches are clunky: \"This is your life, what do you wanna do?\" \"I wanna see the world!\" \"People have underestimated me before. They've been wrong.\" \"I rode an elephant in Bangkok last week!\" But I couldn't help getting carried along with it all. Yes, they serve coffee, but they get to ride elephants! In Bangkok! \u2022 After tonight, the show moves to Saturday evenings, with a double-bill from 9pm. So what did you make of these opening episodes?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
