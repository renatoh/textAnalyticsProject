Leinster needed the points more than their visitors. Moreover they needed to put together a game that has been as inconsistent as their team selection. After a day of torrential rain the chances of a ball-in-hand game had receded long before kick-off. And with a record of just one defeat in their last 20 competitive games at this venue Leinster were concerned that the conditions would expose them to one of those dogfights where just about anything can happen. For Bristol however the early signs were not good: two kickable penalties conceded inside the first five minutes; a buckled scrum and then Felipe Contepomi slicing his first effort at a clearing kick. But with Brian O'Meara succeeding only with his second attempt for Leinster, and Contepomi slotting a penalty on Bristol's first attack, they were happy enough. In their first game in this competition, and away from home, the last thing they needed was to be in catch-up mode after the first quarter. A 6-3 deficit by that point after O'Meara punished Alex Brown, who saw yellow for his second lying-on offence, was manageable. Even more so when Contepomi slotted a good penalty from wide out to level the scores. But what had started as a creaking scrum was becoming a slithering wreck, and on 24 minutes O'Meara tacked on another three to add to the discomfort of the Bristol front row. Leinster's best chance of cap italising on Brown's absence came with a kick and chase from Denis Hickie. He hesitated and the chance was lost, but within minutes the Irish wing made it home. Girvan Dempsey found Gordon D'Arcy with a lovely pass out of the tackle and one wing fed the other to daylight between the teams. O'Meara's conversion was followed by a penalty soon after, and at 19-6 the home team had a winning look about them. Despite Contepomi adding his third penalty early in the second half, Bristol managed to turn the ball over from the restart. And with that went the game. Victor Costello burst over from 10 metres, O'Meara's conversion put Leinster 26-9 clear and with confidence running high that was the business end concluded. Despite conceding two tries they coasted to the finish.
