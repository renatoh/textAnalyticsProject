The EC had challenged the \u00a31 billion three-year agreement, which gave Sky an exclusive right to live matches and which is due to start next year. But Premier League chairmen met to thrash out a deal and a compromise has been agreed. Eight games will now be shown live on terrestrial television next season. The Premier League issued a statement, saying: \"This agreement meets the Commission's competition concerns and strikes a balance between the interests of fans and broadcasters while maintaining the value of our rights. \"Crucially this agreement delivers our clubs financial stability and certainty enabling clubs to plan for the future. \"It protects the principle of competitive joint selling which underpins the integrity of the competition and significantly for fans, maintains the quality of the game both now and in the future.\" EC competitions commissioner Mario Monti had threatened to block the deal, which is due to start next season, believing Sky should not be the only broadcaster screening live matches. Monti opposed a long-term deal, claiming contracts of one season 'are generally acceptable', and added that all clubs should be allowed to do their own deals. The Premier League received the backing of UEFA - but today's ruling nevertheless means Sky will not have exclusive rights of live coverage of top-flight matches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
