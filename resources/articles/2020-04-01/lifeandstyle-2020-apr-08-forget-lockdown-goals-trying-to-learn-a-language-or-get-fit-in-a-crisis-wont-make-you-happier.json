The sadness of lockdown has something in common with grief. Grief is a normal reaction to loss. However, for those already facing serious problems, or experiencing particularly traumatic events now and in the near future, it will be very hard \u2013 and some, like me, are always at risk of depression and anxiety returning. I\u2019m surviving lockdown on my own, with a couple of those \u201cunderlying health issues\u201d that make me more susceptible to the virus, a half-built extension to my house on which all work has (correctly) ceased, my husband 500 miles away \u2013 and back-to-back Covid-19 on Radio 4, the station that is usually the comforting soundtrack of my life. There is a constant temptation to descend into a restless, miserable hibernation between the stressful Zoom conference calls and unwind with a glass of wine \u2013 or two. However, beyond my desk window, wildlife isn\u2019t obeying the physical-distancing rules. The rooks are building their nests close together just as they always do. This week, a hare ran through the garden as I was writing. The daffodils are fully in bloom. Waxy leaves are unfurling on thick red stems in the rhubarb patch. Like nature, I\u2019m trying to maintain my normal routine. Getting plenty of sleep (and not be tempted to bingewatch box sets into the night) and eating healthily \u2013 which is easier now panic-buying has died down and there is more time to cook. I\u2019m watching the amount of alcohol I drink and am trying to keep up my exercise. I hate doing it but I always feel better afterwards. Prone to health anxiety, I must limit my news consumption, switch to something relaxing and get information from more reliable sources than Twitter. Keeping my brain active is also essential, but let\u2019s all avoid setting these ridiculous \u201clockdown\u201d goals. I failed to learn a foreign language well enough in my youth to do much more than ask for a cup of coffee. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll achieve any more just now. Life doesn\u2019t always have to be productive and we can surely forgive ourselves a little laziness in difficult times. Just getting into shops can take long enough. I know where my local support is if I need it. My village has set up a Facebook group for those who are isolating and need home deliveries. It provides essential local information about what\u2019s open and when. Just because I\u2019ve not heard from some people, it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t care about me \u2013 I\u2019ve learned how ruminating doesn\u2019t solve problems, but drags you down. Everyone is living through their own crisis now and we are all focused on staying afloat. Maybe I need to reach out to friends I haven\u2019t heard from, rather than waiting for them to call me. Even if our relationships can be hard at times, they are also a source of immense support. Sadly, you can\u2019t get a hug yet over Skype, but I spend time every day with my loved ones. Last night I enjoyed a virtual G&amp;T with a good friend and it cheered me up no end. We both said: \u201cLet\u2019s do this more often.\u201d We are finding ways to sustain ourselves in these strange times. There is life beyond. We will get there eventually.
