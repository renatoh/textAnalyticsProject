Robbie Fowler (Leeds United) FOR SALE? Alpay Ozalan (Aston Villa) FOR SALE? Francis Jeffers (Arsenal) The Premiership manager Graham Taylor Aston Villa Graham Taylor has spent three decades in football management without transfer windows. His half a season of experience of the new system has not convinced him of their worth. \"The transfer window has caused me nothing but problems so far. Not least in trying to resolve the situation we have with Alpay, our Turkish international defender. \"He has not been happy at the club for almost a year and the situation is getting quite ridiculous. In fact, I'm brassed off with it. \"There is so much more I could say in public and no one has heard the whole story. Only a certain side of it has been put. \"Alpay submitted a transfer request in the summer but no club came in for him before the transfer window closed at the end of August. I hoped we could sort things out then but the situation has deteriorated. Since then we've had one inquiry - Blackburn wanting him in exchange for John Curtis - and he's played four games. Now he's totally outside things, turning up for training but not wanting to play for us. \"In all my years in the game, I've not had to deal with a top-quality player who, for whatever reason, does not want to play. \"In fairness, whether there is a transfer window or not you can only move a player if somebody wants him or he wants to move. So it does not make too much difference on that score. Nevertheless the situation with Alpay would probably have been resolved earlier had the transfer windows not been introduced. Now it's going to have to be resolved in the next 31 days. But if nothing happens, what then? \"Taking a broader view, I don't think the transfer window is going to make a great deal of difference this season. The reality of life in the Premiership at the moment is that times are getting harder. That is not just a fact for Aston Villa, it is a reality that every club in the Premiership is having to face up to. There is no question that the bottom has fallen out of the transfer market. In the long term, however, I think we'll take the system of transfer windows in our stride when we all get used to it.\" The agent John Colquhoun Key Sports Agency John Colquhoun believes the transfer restrictions will contribute to some people in his profession going out of business within the next year. The former Scotland international predicts a busy month, mainly trying to arrange loan deals, but believes there will be few big-money signings. \"The biggest problem in our industry is not the transfer window but the financial condition of our clubs. Our industry is suffering the same as everyone else and there are genuine fears now that the transfer window might play a part in people eventually going out of business. \"For those agents who work purely in football it will be hard to sustain a 12-month business when there are so many financial problems in the game and only two condensed periods in which to do business. \"It's hard to say at this early stage exactly what an effect it will have. Traditionally there has not been that much business between September and December 31 anyway. \"We're still at an early stage but I do know there is a school of thought that the transfer window might not last any longer here than one season. \"Fifa are hardly known for backing down, but a lot of people in the game believe the system worked fine beforehand. There are one or two concerns that we may have fallen in line with Fifa's regulations too quickly when other countries have kept their own guidelines. In France, for example, their rules allow them to make one signing a season, so long as it is between French clubs.\" The chairman Freddy Shepherd Newcastle United Despite the fact that Newcastle United spent \u00a313m on Hugo Viana and Titus Bramble last summer, adding to the \u00a35m that went on Jer maine Jenas last February, there is widespread expectation that Bobby Robson will spend again now. Robson, with \u00a334m spent in the past 18 months alone, has talked recently of needing a commanding centre-half - \"there is one Italian defender in particular I like\" - but the man above him at St James' Park, the chairman Freddy Shepherd, has played down a January spending spree. As at all clubs Newcastle's debt is a moveable feast but an accepted figure is \u00a380m, repayable by 2020. No wonder Shepherd is cautious. \"2002 has been a very good year for us, probably the best since Kevin Keegan left in 1997. The feelgood factor is high but we must not let ourselves get carried away, especially in the current financial climate. \"I believe the transfer market will not be as busy as some people are predicting, in fact I believe there will be very few large deals. It would be easy to start throwing money after success but the club has to be run on a sound and sensible basis. And it will be. \"We are delighted to be in the Champions League but at the same time we have to make sure that the price of being there doesn't put the club in financial jeopardy. It's easy to get carried away and throw money around. \"The market is now cooling. It was severely over-heated both in terms of fees and wages but reality is now setting in. Perhaps we needed that to happen. In a capitalist society that is market forces at work. It may not be a position people are comfortable with, unfortunately it is simple reality.\" The Nationwide manager Paul Jewell Wigan Athletic Paul Jewell believes the introduction of the transfer window will not have the impact on the Football League that it will on the Premiership. because the same restrictions on trade do not apply. Wigan, top of the Second Division and fuelled by a wealthy owner-chairman in Dave Whelan, are in the position of not needing to sell or buy, though Jewell would obviously like to strengthen his squad. \"The opening of the window doesn't mean a great deal to us, it hasn't stopped us taking players and we can take players from the Premier League at any time. What it has done is stop Premiership clubs making offers for any of our players if they had wanted to. \"I'm lucky in that our chairman has put a lot of money into the club and is ambitious, so to sell one of our players the offer would have to be mind-blowing. People like Nathan Ellington simply aren't for sale. \"When I go into another manager's office the talk is always about the lack of money, not transfers. You can tell it's dead [the market] because agents don't ring the way they used to. \"What's happening is causing an absolute reality check at all levels. The players are often portrayed as greedy but the days of average footballers down here in the lower divisions earning \u00a3100,000 or \u00a3200,000 a year are going - and the players know that. Salaries are going to be halved in some cases; 750 players were on the PFA released list last year and I can see that figure being doubled next summer.\" The player Chris Marsden Southampton The left-sided midfielder took a roundabout route to the Premiership, finally arriving at Southampton four years ago at the age of 30. And he does not expect to go anywhere else very soon. \"No one at Southampton appears to be paying too much attention that the transfer window will be open for the next month. In fact, I think it's escaped most people. That's possibly because we've got a small squad and the club is doing well. \"If we were having problems or had a load of injuries, then I guess we would be expecting the manager to make a signing or two. But we're seventh in the Premiership, everybody is involved and people are happy with their lot. \"I imagine that's not the case everywhere. Most players want to play and some who are not getting games are probably hoping they will get a move. My former Southampton team-mate Hassan Kachloul is out of the picture at Aston Villa and I know he'd rather play than do nothing. \"Players who are happy to take the money and not play are few and far between. But I think most players in that situation are realistic enough to accept that there's not much money about in the game at the moment, especially in the Nationwide League. As a result moving will mean having to drop down a division and accept lower wages. \"A more likely scenario is that Premiership clubs may end up subsidising their fringe players to go out on loan to Nationwide League teams, if only to reduce their wage bills. An alternative could be clubs paying up some players' contracts.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
