Then he handed the end of the rope to my three sons and told them to smile and pull. The result was used to illustrate some article I'd written. I can't remember where the article appeared or what it was about, but you get the idea: I could not, even then, control my children. My wife had the photo framed and hung it in the hall, where it serves to remind me how eerily compliant I can be in the company of photographers. It also shows how long I've been pitching myself as a useless father. If only I'd known then how bad it would get. In those days, I was actually of some service to my kids. I could tie shoelaces. I could draw a cat. Now if one them says, \"Dad, I need your help\", it's invariably because he's trying to order something on the internet and has reached the stage of the transaction where you need a credit card number. Mostly, though, the photograph just makes me feel old. It's clear from the way the children are dressed that only the eldest was of school age, and while the older two are grinning and tugging as instructed, the youngest is staring into the lens in perfect bewilderment and appears to be using the taut rope to hold himself upright. The man tied to the tree may be sporting a theatrically world-weary expression, but his face is hardly lined and his hair is dark and thick. Despite the rope digging into the flesh of his arms, he looks comparatively untroubled. I deliberately stop and look at this photo from time to time, to chart the progress from then to now. Through this regular monitoring, I hope to process my children's growth, my own decay and the runaway train of change incrementally, or at least in manageable chunks. I do not want the passage of time to take me by surprise. I will experience change, inevitable as it may be, on my terms. Then, last week, the tree fell down. I hadn't counted on that. When I went to the park with the dog before lunch it was there; when I went out after lunch it was lying on its side, all six storeys of it, surrounded by police tape. High winds had evidently blown it over, snapping the 4ft-thick trunk at its base. When I pass the photograph in the hall later, I think: \"My ruse has failed. Time continues to pass in leaps and bounds.\" The next day I drag my youngest son away from the television to go and look at the fallen tree. \"Do you remember posing for that photograph?\" I say. \"The one in the hall?\" \"Nope,\" he says. \"Look, it's like sponge inside,\" I say, kicking the rotten stump. \"Dad, you're breaking the law,\" he says, pointing to the police tape. \"It's amazing, really, that it stayed up as long as it did.\" \"Can we go?\" \"Yeah.\" I stare at the sheared stump for a moment, then gaze out at the horizon. Then I look at the stump again. \"You know what?\" I say. \"I don't think this is the tree.\" \"Isn't it?\" he says. \"No, I think that's the tree. Over there.\" I point to another oak of similar size about 30 yards away. We stalk toward it through the tall grass. \"Or maybe that one,\" he says, pointing to a third tree. \"No, this is it,\" I say. \"The background lines up with the picture. I always thought it was that one, but it's definitely this one.\" \"Huh,\" he says. The wind gusts suddenly, and I look up into the churning mass of leaves above. \"Let's not stand here,\" I say."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
