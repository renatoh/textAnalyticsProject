Damn her charm and intelligence. Damn her easy laugh, gangly-limbed grace, oceanic charisma, the Georgia lilt to her voice that speaks of hard work, humidity and perfectly ripe peaches. Damn it all. Let's be clear: I love Julia Roberts. She's one of the few people \u2013 along with George Clooney, perhaps, and Meryl Streep \u2013 who would have been a guaranteed box-office bonanza whether she'd pitched up in Hollywood in the 1910s, when the streets were still lined with lemon trees; in the 1940s, when fast-talking dames were all the rage; or in the 1970s, when women were often given nothing much to do on screen whatsoever. (She would have shone through the machismo like a beacon.) But it's because Roberts is so guilelessly compelling that she managed to turn one of the most sexist, soupy, stupid premises of all time into a hit movie. Damn her for Pretty Woman. Plenty of people love Pretty Woman, of course. The film is one of the highest-grossing romantic comedies in history, raking in more than $450m to date and sending Roberts into the stratosphere (she was in her early 20s when the film was made and quickly became the highest-paid woman in Hollywood). In fact, the film was such a success that it's about to get a Valentine's weekend re-release to mark its 20th anniversary. These celebratory screenings will hit cinemas at the same time as the inventively titled Valentine's Day, the new film from Pretty Woman's director, Garry Marshall, which includes Roberts in its sprawling cast. (The film's intertwined Los Angeles love stories have been described as \"Love, Actually, without the irony\": could there be a more blood-curdling prospect?) But back to Pretty Woman \u2013 surely one of the strangest romantic comedies ever made. Here's the setup. Gere, as \"corporate raider\" Edward, borrows his lawyer's Lotus, gets lost on Hollywood Boulevard and encounters wry, beautiful prostitute Vivian, played by Roberts. Edward proceeds to buy Vivian for the week for $3,000. Romantic, right? She is already a male fantasy \u2013 gamine, gorgeous, with an extensive knowledge of cars and an ability to knot ties \u2013 but she's a little rough around the edges for Edward. He therefore sends her to buy classier clothes, feeds her snails, takes her to the polo. He tests her soul with a night at the opera; she passes with misty-eyed distinction. Edward's job is to buy companies and sell off the assets. He buys Vivian and turns her around, too. They fall in love, of course, and the film's biggest triumph is to dress this up as a straightforward fairytale. The movie was apparently more realistic at one stage in its development, but by the time it reached the screen, any grit had been replaced by girlish glamour. When Edward suggests he can set Vivian up with an apartment, she refuses, and talks of her childhood dream of being rescued by a prince. The movie ends with Edward arriving at Vivian's home to scale her fire escape and claim her. \"What happened after he walked up the tower and rescued her?\" he asks. \"She rescues him right back,\" she replies. The film seems to end on a note of parity, then, and actually one of the project's best qualities is Roberts's saltiness and steel: you never really believe she is less than Gere's equal. But still, her character is the ultimate example of that oldest, most noxious of movie cliches, the prostitute with a heart of gold (\"Get me a P with an H of G!\" the legendary film producer, Samuel Goldwyn, apparently shouted when a script came up short). It's a stereotype that's popular for two reasons. One, it depicts women as bodies to be bought and sold. Two, it depicts them as moral saviours. Completely available; completely redemptive. Ker-ching: you've hit the womanly jackpot! Watching Pretty Woman now, the surprise is how chaste it is: there is no explicit sex, little ugly language. The pain lies in its central premise, and in what came next. Since its success we've seen a growing stream of stories \u2013 memoirs, TV shows \u2013 that have painted prostitution as a glamorous, even romantic option, that have backed up the idea of it as just another career choice, with few negative repercussions. And, beyond that, film comedies have become increasingly sexist. In the past year we've seen Sandra Bullock playing a bitch to be tamed in The Proposal, Anna Faris being date-raped for laughs in Observe and Report. Can all this be laid directly at Pretty Woman's door? Of course not. But one thing's for sure \u2013 we won't encourage Hollywood to make movies that are less misogynist by flocking happily to a romcom in which the main male character buys the main female character and proceeds to mould her into his dream gal. Damn Pretty Woman for that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
