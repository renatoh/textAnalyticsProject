Chelsea\u2019s manager has been superstitious since he was a player and he offered an insight into his mental preparations as he discussed walking his dog Minnie via a certain route at a certain time in the day. Structure matters to Lampard, who has been named the Premier League\u2019s manager of the month for October, and he admitted he frets if his routines are disrupted. \u201cIf I don\u2019t do them, then I can feel like, ridiculously, as if it might have an effect on the result,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I do miss the dog walk for whatever reason. I\u2019m a relatively new dad, my daughter is a year and a bit, so sometimes I have to do other things. It does not absolutely hold me down.\u201d Lampard, who said Mason Mount would have a fitness test on an ankle injury before Saturday\u2019s home game against Crystal Palace, was asked whether it is a rational fear. \u201cNot really, I suppose,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t mind structure and I like walking the dog. If it was something that was painful, I would probably try and get rid of it but it actually fits nicely. I like going to the gym, I like walking the dog, I like eating pasta as a pre-match meal, so I stick with certain things. And then if we don\u2019t win \u2026 \u201cI did it as a player. It was very commonplace in our dressing room. John Terry used to do it a lot. John was very structured in his buildup. I don\u2019t completely rely on it. I joke a little bit but I think it shows how much you want to do well and win sometimes, whether it has an effect or not. And I think if that\u2019s in your mindset, that\u2019s not the worst thing, albeit it might become a bit annoying sometimes if you stick to it.\u201d Lampard was asked to lay out his dog-walking routine. \u201cI put the lead on,\u201d he said. \u201cI take her out in the morning. I go out early before I leave, I take her down to the local coffee shop, get my takeaway coffee, walk around, pick up her shit, put it in the bin, walk her home then go to training. \u201cI walk the dog a lot and I find it quite good for clearing the head. I like to go to the gym as well \u2013 that\u2019s another one of my superstitions. I have to spend the same amount of time on the bike \u2013 50 minutes \u2013 or the amount that I run. Things like that. I\u2019m still sweating now. I\u2019ve just been doing it.\u201d Lampard said Ross Barkley could be forced to withdraw from the England squad with an ankle injury and added that Antonio R\u00fcdiger would be out for three weeks following surgery on a pelvic problem."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
