Apart from a hauntingly pitiable portfolio of pictures, that is. One legacy, which may well come back to haunt a continuing Tony Blair, is the end of New Labour's prevailing wisdom on privacy and the press. Go back to the middle of August, when the News of the World first told us about Blunkett in Love, and the Mirror, Sun and Mail all piled in behind, naming the (then) Kimberly Fortier and revealing her second pregnancy. That, for our more upmarket papers (and public ser vice TV) was a story too far. The Home Secretary was entitled to his privacy. He was a fine, much admired human being as well as a man of power. Eyes were duly averted, pens put aside. The Independent published nothing. The Guardian wrote an editorial that named neither the Home Secretary nor his mistress. The Times, like the Telegraph, ran a few sparse paragraphs. The spasm of coverage died, almost shamefacedly, as September came. And perhaps - just perhaps - very senior ministers could still find themselves in love tangles without getting their private and public lives tangled, too. Perhaps higher- minded journalists could still pass by on the other side of the street, separating tat from duty, following human rights codes as well as the scent. But who can possibly believe that now? Only those truly convinced of the eternal tawdriness of the trade, like Polly Toynbee of the Guardian. For Polly, Blunkett was laid waste by a 'two-week feeding frenzy'. Day after day, relentlessly, she wrote, 'even when nothing new happened, his tormentors plastered the front pages. The coconut-shy school of journalism transcends the media's political biases: when the pack wants blood, it usually gets it'. Fine, but not entirely burdened by the facts of this miserable matter. The Sun lamented a 'great loss' as he went, 'a man of great honour knifed by the woman he loved'. The Mail found Blunkett 'a giant in a Cabinet of pygmies' and painstakingly insisted that it had 'never called for his resignation'. There were a few detractors around, to be sure. Paul Routledge in the Mirror rejoiced at the blow to a 'hideously right-wing agenda' and put the boot into Blunkett's 'foolish, self-indulgent behaviour'. Others, from the Independent 's leader writer to Simon Jenkins in the Times, took a similar line: hate his politics, can't cut him much slack. Axe-grinders of the Boris Johnson variety - 'He did the one thing a Prime Minister can never forgive: he told the truth about the Labour government' - unleashed predictable inverted pyramids of political piffle. Yet as feeding frenzies go, this was a pretty sparse bush-tucker trial. David Blunkett has friends in the media village: Paul Potts at the Press Association, Paul Dacre at the Mail, Rebekah Wade and associated bosses at News International. He couldn't be lightly cast aside. What did for him was the briefing war between his other 'friends' and the 'friends of Mrs Quinn'; the battle of the anonymous spokesmen that revealed the speed of the nanny's visa (and then her mobile phone number), that flourished first-class train tickets to Derbyshire and anxious huddles with Home Office officials. When media love goes bad, the vilification and revelation and desperation go from bad to worse. What did for him was that wretched biography - in the writing works last August - that slagged off too many Cabinet colleagues too openly, and 'protected his privacy' by dealing only briefly with Blunkett in Love. Why give the Cabinet so much stick? Because, wrote his unlikely biographer, Stephen Pollard, in the Mail, he is 'brutally honest'. Ask a straightforward question and you got a straightforward, on-the-record answer. 'The arrogance which his triumph over his background and his disability ... had given him meant he was less cautious than he ought to have been.' What did for him was a court case for access to his baby son publicly - and prospectively lengthily - waged. What did for him was an email that showed that, yes, the mandarins at his side had put the nanny's visa on a rocket booster, whatever he knew or might have guessed. None of those things, the daggers and the darts, have much do with privacy on any relevant count. There's nothing private about rabbiting away to a biographer with a tape-recorder running; nothing private about a bitter court case; nothing possibly private about playing spin and counter-spin with a mightily pregnant but formidably connected Mrs Quinn. There was no possibility that such explosions could be kept quiet or prevented from billowing across the political stage - and the press is there to feel the shockwaves. And now, because they have done so, because yet another minister has been defended by the Prime Minister and then bowed to the inevitable, the doctrine of divided standards itself looks shattered (at least for the New Labour duration). The issue has become the PM's judgment and his strength when standing by his men and women. Now, one more love tangle or financial finagle in the ranks will come straight to his door, a test of true 'public interest' as sanctified by Press Complaints Commission codes and European charters. That may be a bleak outcome, a kind of licensed alternative to fox-hunting. It may, fed with frenzy, stick in many readers' and writers' gullets. But that is where Mr Blunkett has left Mr Blair. That's where the wisdom lies now: a shredded, tear-drenched thing. Don't blink now - it's the Lite at the end of the tunnel On the one hand, they both seem to be singing from the same hymn sheet. 'We should be celebrating the bravery of this,' according to Mike Anderson, managing director of the London Evening Standard - and thus of the new, free, Standard Lite. 'It is a very clever idea. It is not the end of the road, it is the beginning of the future.' Yes indeed, echoes editor Veronica Wadley. The Lite 'is bold, innovative, aimed at the market we want to reach.' So boldness and bravery be my friend. Running two separate editions of an existing paper - one paid-for, the other free - isn't at all unusual. On the contrary, it's becoming standard prac tice right across American big cities. Chicago does it, Washington does it. The publisher of the Miami Herald was talking openly last week about one Herald, costing $1.50 or so and serving 'sophisticated readers' with 'in-depth articles', operating alongside a free tabloid version for twentysomethings who want their news fast and light. That's the exact Standard Lite formula. It could find a fresh audience to replace the one the paid-for paper has lost. It could be salvation on the ads front. It plonks 50,000 free Standards into the middle of a day's sales like a shot of adrenaline. Maybe Anderson's right: maybe the future starts here. Except that there is another page to the hymn sheet. 'This is not a precursor to the Standard going free,' according to Wadley. 'This is a news snack - it still leaves you with an appetite for the West End Final,' according to Anderson. The Lite one, say the Standard 's own blurb writers, is only available 'in limited numbers in parts of central London'. Meanwhile, 'the main editions are better value for money than ever'. So boldness also has its timorous side. Here's a possibly brilliant idea that can't be exported outside the Circle Line, can't advance no matter how much readers like it. Rubbish; and atypical rubbish from the wise heads at Associated. What, as Paul Dacre might inquire, is the real truth here? It is surely that nobody actually knows what will happen. It is that, nonetheless, they were brave enough to take a leap in the dark. Full marks for innovation. Few, as yet, for hymn-sheet orchestration. Just leave the poor girl alone If you want to get steamed up about privacy all over again, get steaming for Charlotte Church. There, unaccountably, she was on the front page of the Daily Star on Thursday morning. Forget Blunkett - the big headline said 'CHARLOTTE LURCH'. Good story? Hardly, according to a less excited Daily Mirror . 'Just another night and another boozy session' for the 'Angel of the Valleys' - now all of 18. She goes to a West End club with her boyfriend. The lurking snappers who can't find Prince Harry settle for a singer they've stalked through the years. Did she have a tincture over a load? Probably. Can you blame her, relentlessly pursued and intruded upon since her earliest teens (whatever the PCC code says)? No, she's a victim viciously singled out - and, as they buy another round in the press bar tonight, maybe they should remember that she's our victim."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
