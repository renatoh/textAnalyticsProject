Judge the issue, not me.\" So wrote \u2013 on Twitter \u2013 Jemima Khan, heiress, freedom of speech campaigner, occasional writer and now political interviewer. Call her anything in fact, just not a socialite. \"It's such a lazy way for journalists to undermine me,\" she says. Khan's latest contribution to journalism came when she not only interviewed the deputy prime minister for the New Statesman but also guest-edited the week's issue, themed around freedom of speech, pulling in contributors from Russell Brand to her ex, Hugh Grant. Jason Cowley, NS editor, said he had been thinking about the idea since Khan had unexpectedly turned up at the trial of the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, posting part of the bail money. Cowley said he was impressed: \"I was surprised to see Jemima turning up at court. An interviewer asked why she was there. She said that she had never met Assange but believed profoundly in the work of WikiLeaks, as I do.\" A breakfast meeting followed. \"She seemed quite nervous but very determined. I knew quite quickly the issue would be a success because she has good journalistic instincts, sound judgment and charm.\" He added that the magazine team was impressed by her diligence and enthusiasm. Why, he adds, would anybody object to her guest-editing? \"Because she's very rich? Far better to judge people as you find them, by what they do and say, and Jemima has been very committed to human rights issues in Pakistan and to freedom of information and the open society.\" Jemima Marcelle Goldsmith was just 20, already weary of the social circuit, when she met the 42-year-old Imran Khan on a night out with friends and the two were engaged within weeks, thrilling and horrifying their circle of acquaintances and admirers. \"I always assumed that my wife fell in love with me because of my passions and ambitions,\" Imran Khan said later. Within months, she converted to Islam and on 16 May 1995 the couple wed in a two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris. On 21 June, they were married again in a civil ceremony at the Richmond register office before heading off for their new life in Lahore. The marriage produced two sons, Sulaiman, now 14, and Kasim, who celebrates his 12th birthday today. The Spanish honeymoon at one of the Goldsmiths' farms was marred by a paparazzi photographer who took shots of the couple on a sun terrace, with Imran wearing only a sombrero. Jemima's father, the billionaire Sir James Goldsmith, was incandescent and bought up the pictures. But her father couldn't save what Imran said was a \"tough marriage\". In Lahore, he immediately launched his political career while his wife had to adapt to a modest home in a poverty-stricken city. Jemima tried hard to hang on. As rumours circulated that her marriage was in crisis, she placed an advertisement in Pakistan newspapers to deny them. It read: \"Whilst it is true that I am currently studying for a masters degree at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, it is certainly not true to say that Imran and I are having difficulties in our marriage. This is a temporary arrangement.\" But it was not to be and Imran now lives alone on his farm, where he grows fruit trees and keeps cows. He maintains a cricket ground for his two sons, who visit during their holidays and are said to be \"quite good\" at the sport that made their father a star. He blames the 2004 divorce on \"a geographical problem\". \"Cross-cultural marriages are always more difficult. In the western countries, marriages are difficult. All my friends have got divorced, some of them twice,\" he said. \"It was because the two of us realised that she could not live in Pakistan and I could not live outside Pakistan. Once we realised that it became impossible to make the marriage work. And yet we have a very strong bond, we always had it.\" The Goldsmith family home in Richmond Park, Surrey, remains the house where the former Pakistan cricket captain stays when he is in London. Khan lives in Fulham and in Oxfordshire with her beloved boys and boyfriend, long-haired New York literary agent Luke Janklow. Khan talks frequently and fondly about her ex-husband, commenting: \"Someone cynical once said, 'Never marry someone who you wouldn't want to be divorced from.' In this respect, I've been very lucky.\" An apparent effort to return to her maiden name was swiftly thwarted by her son who changed her Twitter account back to Khan from Goldsmith. She clearly still has immense warmth towards Pakistan: \"It's the country I feel I grew up in and was a part of, arriving at 20 and emerging a decade later a more questioning and conflicted person. I am still maddened by its faults but I bristle and become defensive if others criticise.\" She remains deeply mindful of how she is perceived in the country and has refused to answer interviewers who ask if she is still a practising Muslim. \"Religion for me is very personal and I don't really like talking about it,\" she said last week. She is a patron of the moderate Islamic thinktank the Quilliam Foundation, a move which gained her death threats from extremists and she attended the London launch accompanied by a bodyguard. She told reporters at the launch: \"I can't claim to speak for Muslims. I am certainly very far from most people's image of what a good Muslim is.\" \"Importantly, Jemima is a friend,\" said Quilliam's co-founder, Maajid Nawaz, who said it was a typically bold move on Khan's part to back the organisation. \"However, she is also a disarmingly intelligent, down-to-earth, caring and socially conscious philanthropist and loving parent. These are what makes her personality appealing to so many both here and abroad.\" If anything comes before beliefs and politics for Khan, it is her family. Her younger brother, Zac, is a Tory MP and she campaigned hard for his election last year and said she was proud of him, even though she didn't share all his political views. Her adored late father loved a political battle. An arch anti-European, he was briefly the publisher of the French news magazine L'Express. His long-running battle with Private Eye nearly bankrupted the satirical magazine and his reaction to being asked by Imran for his daughter's hand was the non-culturally sensitive: \"Why? Has she been shoplifting?\" Jemima's mother, Lady Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart, daughter of the eighth Marquess of Londonderry, was once described by the Daily Telegraph as a \"one-woman glitterati procurement programme\". Annabel's, the London nightclub for the upper-class party set, was named after her by her first husband, Mark Birley. She is a strong character with a campaigning spirit who has kept her family close \u2013 despite Sir Jimmy's adultery \u2013 and displayed the kind of warmth that had Jemima's schoolfriends wishing she was their mother too. The charm of the mother is undoubtedly in the daughter and many otherwise hard-nosed men do find themselves a little breathless in her company. Clegg seems to have been reduced to sentimental pulp but, says WikiLeaks lawyer Mark Stephens: \"Woe betide if you get seduced by her charm and undoubted good looks, as many interviewees have discovered to their cost. There is a serious intellect working that gives no quarter to sloppy thinking.\" He adds: \"Jealous journalists tend not to look beyond her image and upbringing. It should not be a surprise that a woman from her background can be clever, funny and feminine, but rather shockingly it appears to be so to some.\" Not everyone is impressed. Kevin Maguire, the New Statesman's regular political diarist, tweeted: \"Errant MPs may breathe easier, Socialite @Jemima_Khan guest-editing New Statesman so I'm stood down this week.\" But Henry Porter, a journalist who has been working with Khan on a civil liberty campaign, said there was a lot of pomposity being talked around the issue. \"Jemima is cut from the same sort of cloth as Arianna Huffington, a bit fearless and utterly genuine,\" says Porter. \"And yes it's easier to be fearless if you've got money but we have a great tradition of grand lady radicals going back to the Whigs of the 18th century. The Duchess of Devonshire and all that. Jemima is very much part of that tradition. I'm quite sure we'll be seeing a lot more of her.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
