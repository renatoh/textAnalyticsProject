Never before, not even in some of the darker days of the past decade, have they suffered a defeat comparable to this - an innings and 283 runs - and Ramnaresh Sarwan, their beleaguered, injured captain, unable to bat in either innings, looked suitably contrite. By contrast, in the ceremonial aftermath of the game, Michael Vaughan, with his 20th win as captain, has now, in fewer matches, equalled the record of Peter May, hitherto the most successful leader. Vaughan was greeted by the substantial crowd who braved perishing temperatures as if he were Alexander the Great in his pomp on his return from conquering India, a challenge Vaughan will face in the coming months. If it was an emphatic return for the captain - this was England's third biggest win by an innings - then there is a context to it: Captain Birdseye could have run the show here and won. West Indies, so plucky at Lord's and justifiably praised for it, were just dismal. Perhaps a few nights out on the town might help. The England bowlers, finding conditions still in favour of diligent bowling, simply pecked away bit by bit to dismiss West Indies for 141 inside 43 overs, with Ryan Sidebottom, hair streaming as he bounded down the slope from the Kirkstall Lane end, collecting a further two wickets to those he took on Saturday evening, giving him fourfor 44, and eight for 86, in what has been a memorable second Test for him. For no other reason than demonstrating the old-fashioned virtues that can still be found in the shires, he deserved more. There were three wickets for Steve Harmison, too, although he is far from the relentless, destructive force he once was, creating whatever uncertainty he does not down a corridor but cricket's equivalent of the New Jersey Turnpike, making Matt Prior earn his gymnastic corn. The two other wickets went to Liam Plunkett and Monty Panesar, the former continuing to mix unplayable deliveries with unwatchable dross. Somewhere in between Plunkett's sublime and ridiculous lies a considerable bowler, but he is a work in progress. England now have a week to recuperate and gather their thoughts before the third and fourth Tests, at Old Trafford and Chester-le-Street, come in a back-to-back flurry. The prospect is not likely to fill West Indies with anticipation, for they might have heard of global warming but have experienced little evidence of it on this trip. They are unlikely to find pineapples growing in Stretford or olive groves in Ashington. It is not just the cricket and the itinerary that is conspiring against them. If it has been an emphatic start to the international coaching career of Peter Moores - with the selection of Sidebottom a notice of intent and a beacon of hope for those in the county game who saw only a closed shop - then he knows that life will get no easier than this. There will be changes to be made, too, and successful as Sidebottom has been, that ought not necessarily to translate into an automatic slot next time around, the selection equivalent of a captain setting fields retroactively. So the progress Matthew Hoggard has made towards regaining full fitness will be watched closely, as will that of Andrew Flintoff, although as far back as a fortnight, before the Lord's Test, the murmurs from within the England camp were that he would not be able to bowl in this series and may require further surgery on his troublesome ankle. Mindful of the manner in which, without bowling unduly well, he massacred Pakistan on the Old Trafford trampoline, Harmison's place will not be in jeopardy. It will be interesting to see what immediate impact the presence of Allan Donald, the great fast bowler hired as consultant, has on Plunkett. How West Indies recover from this will test the resolve of Sarwan, who seems likely to miss the rest of the series, his deputy Daren Ganga, and the team management. At Lord's, where the ball did not move to such an extravagant extent, the manner in which they and dug themselves out of trouble was a revelation. Here West Indies exhibited neither the desire nor the technique to cope with lateral movement, with Dwayne Bravo's belligerent half-century the only bright light on a dull day and the slaphappy manner in which Runako Morton was suckered into attempting to pull a short ball from Harmison to end a stand of 63 with Bravo, the only worthwhile alliance of the innings, indicative of the general air of surrender. Perhaps the answer lies a hundred miles to the south, in a Leicestershire field where this weekend has been held Glastonbudget, the festival for tribute bands featuring the likes of Fake That, Pink Fraud, Antarctic Monkeys and Oasish. So good are these acts, apparently, that it is hard to tell them from the real thing at times. Perhaps it is time to introduce the Best Indies, and scour the Caribbean for Shiv Richards, Curly Ambrose and Gordon Greengage, fellows who can play the game in the manner to which we are accustomed. They could not do a lot worse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
