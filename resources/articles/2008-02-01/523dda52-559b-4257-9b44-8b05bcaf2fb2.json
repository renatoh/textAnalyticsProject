Lurking in the US constitution is a different type of threat to the prospects of the likely GOP nominee: the requirement that \"no person except a natural born citizen ... shall be eligible to the office of president\". If, as many scholars believe, that language means that the president has to have been born in the US, McCain has a problem. He was born in the Panama Canal Zone while his father served in the navy. Whether or not McCain is disqualified, his candidacy is an opportunity for a critical look at this antiquated rule, and can perhaps be the incentive to get rid of it once and for all. The \"natural born citizen\" standard is unique to the presidency. Every other federal official can be foreign born. Historians speculate that John Jay added the phrase to the constitution to prevent the Prussian Baron von Steuben from being president. The provision was not discussed by the drafters of the constitution, is not defined anywhere and has never been interpreted by any court. It has, however, cast a shadow over many candidates, including Mitt Romney's father, Michigan governor George Romney, who was born in Mexico and was a leading GOP contender in 1968 until he said he was \"brainwashed\" about the Vietnam war. Children born overseas to American parents, like McCain, are citizens at birth under federal law. Congress is free to pass (or not pass) a law to define citizenship in this way, but a congressional statute cannot override a constitutional requirement regarding eligibility for office. So it remains an open question whether the foreign-born offspring of US citizens meet the constitutional test for being \"natural born\". The possible answers touch on two experiences that shaped American history: immigration and its perverse doppelganger, slavery. The fourteenth amendment was added to the constitution after the civil war to grant citizenship to \"persons born or naturalised in the United States\". This language was intended to overturn the supreme court's pre-civil war Dred Scott decision and make clear that former slaves were citizens. But the wording of the fourteenth amendment had the unintended consequence of conferring citizenship on any child born on US territory, even if the child's parents are here illegally and can never be citizens themselves. America is still grappling with the human results of that definition of citizenship at birth. The fourteenth amendment's language about automatic citizenship for persons \"born ... in the United States\" created another issue: are people born in overseas US possessions (like the Panama Canal Zone, or the Philippines before 1946) American citizens at birth? The courts have ruled that only those born in one of the states, and not in outlying territories, are \"born in the United States\" for purposes of the fourteenth amendment. If that principle were applied to the \"natural born citizen\" requirement, McCain's Canal Zone birthplace would disqualify him. Other arguments support McCain's eligibility to be president. Some are technical (the fourteenth amendment impliedly repealed the \"natural born citizen\" rule) and others are historical (the drafters of the constitution understood that children of American citizens born overseas were citizens). The bottom line is that no one really knows what \"natural born citizen\" means, and the supreme court would have the final say. Justices who were willing to pick the winner of the 2000 election (albeit by a 5-4 vote) likely would not stand in the way of a McCain inaugural. But whatever happens with McCain, we must decide whether 18th-century concerns about Baron von Steuben should continue to dictate presidential eligibility in 21st-century America, and whether we should continue to send an unmistakable message of exclusion to tens of millions of naturalised Americans. Immigration is a bitterly divisive issue today. But both parties (and independents) should find common ground and agree that it no longer makes sense to bar naturalised citizens like Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California (born in Austria) or Democratic governor Jennifer Granholm of Michigan (born in Canada) from the presidency. We are about to make history with the first major party female or African-American nominee. It is an especially good time to rid ourselves of another anachronism, and remove the \"natural born citizen\" requirement from our constitution.
