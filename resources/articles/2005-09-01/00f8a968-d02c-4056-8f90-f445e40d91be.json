Lee Beevers was the first to be shown the red card, for two bookable offences, and he was followed by goalkeeper Alan Marriott and Paul Morgan. The latter, Lincoln's captain, was sent off for kicking out at Alan Connell, the scorer of Torquay's second goal, and Marriott brought the same fate upon himself by running 20 yards to follow up by kicking the ball at the striker. Grimsby, whose Carling Cup win over Tottenham has seen them drawn against another Premiership club - Newcastle - in the next round, were brought down to earth by being held to a1-1 draw at Boston. Grimsby went ahead with a penalty by Jean-Paul Kamudimba Kalala - their scoring star against Tottenham - following a foul by Austin McCann. But though McCann was sent off for it, Boston equalised in the last minute through Julian Joachim. Wycombe regained some of their self-esteem following their 8-3 thrashing by Aston Villa with a 3-2 win at Mansfield, thus maintaining their position as the only team unbeaten in the league. Their scoring star was Kevin Betsy, who got a hat-trick."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
