Venter faces being charged by the Rugby Football Union after launching an attack on David Rose, who refereed Saracens' defeat by Leicester at Vicarage Road last Saturday. He was particularly upset that interpretations at the breakdown have made attacking rugby hazardous. Bath have been the Premiership's entertainers in recent seasons but Meehan said they had had to adjust their approach because of the laws, adding that he was disappointed that what was intended to be a positive change was having a negative effect. \"Some of our new players have now adjusted to the way the Premiership is refereed and it is officiated differently to the Super 14 and other competitions. We are a bit more savvy, a bit more intelligent and a bit more aware of what's acceptable and what isn't. \"For the third time in three seasons we've got different breakdown laws. So that was always going to be a little bit difficult, but it's not just the law that has made it difficult for us. Last season we had a very good run with injuries, but we haven't had that luxury this season. There's that aspect, but there is also the law aspect. We've been a little concerned about whether to go, whether not to, and have been caught in two minds at times. It's disappointing to have what was a strength becoming a situation where we're unsure whether it's good to go or not. It is a pity for the players and for the supporters.\" Meehan said that he hoped his two playmakers, Butch James and Olly Barkley, who have not played this season because of leg injuries, would be in contention for the LV Cup clash against Leicester at the end of the month, but the full-back, Nick Abendanon, will be out for another four weeks. Leicester expect their England flanker, Tom Croft, to be fit for next week's Heineken Cup group match against Ospreys in Swansea. The Wales and Lions centre, Jamie Roberts, has signed a new contract with Cardiff Blues, while Harlequins have signed the Argentinian second-row Tom\u00e1s Vallejos from Parma for the rest of the season. Worcester have opened talks with their former Australia full-back, Chris Latham, who is considering whether to take up the option of a third year on his contract."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
