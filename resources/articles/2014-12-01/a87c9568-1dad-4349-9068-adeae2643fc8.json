The biggest accidental film of the year. What did we learn then: It wasn\u2019t that funny \u2013 unless you are really into jokes about genitalia There were a lot of celebrity cameos, including: Eminem, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bill Maher, Seth Meyers Apart from the premise \u2013 killing the leader of North Korea \u2013 there wasn\u2019t that much content aimed at mocking the country. Most of it was about vacuous TV journalists The creators love hip-hop bangers and Katy Perry Lord Of The Rings references might be here to stay for good Here\u2019s a rough percentage breakdown of the film\u2019s content put together by my colleague Kayla Epstein: 5% celebrity cameos 25% penis jokes 20% anus jokes 2% Lord Of The Rings references long past their expiration date 20% sexism 3% Jonah from Veep 5% awkward samplings of outdated top 40 hits 10% \u201cfunny\u201d accents 10% Seth Rogen looking at a helicopter with sad eyes Thank the lord. The pair are back in America and Sook IS THE NEW LEADER OF NORTH KOREA. That\u2019s it. They\u2019re now speeding away on a boat while the Scorpions Wind Of Change plays in the background. Hip-hop bangers just don\u2019t really evoke pathos. Ten minutes to go: the bros are in a tunnel, seemingly on their way to freedom, while Sook is staying in North Korea to help put her country back together in the power vacuum that will no doubt exist after Jong-un\u2019s demise/head explosion. Kim is dead. His head exploded as well after Francobro fired a shell at him from a tank. Ok, they\u2019re playing Katy Perry\u2019s Firework again. I\u2019m predicting sales on iTunes are going to go through the roof. One thing I wasn\u2019t expecting is the levels of gore. There\u2019s blood everywhere as Rogen, Sook and Francobro attempt to make good their escape. It\u2019s like the end of the Wild Bunch. Oh, he had a bulletproof vest on. Oh dear. Franco went too far. Kim Jong-un just SHOT HIM. I can\u2019t believe there are still 20 minutes left at this point. After Kim Jong-un padded away some of Franco\u2019s best questions, he comes undone when Franco starts singing Katy Perry\u2019s Firework and jibbing him about the fact he thought \u201cmargaritas were gay\u201d. Back to the film 1 hour and 27 minutes in and things have kicked off. Franco is doing his best Jeremy Paxman/Charlie Rose impression while grilling Kim Jong-un. In the back Rogen is biting off some guy\u2019s fingers. This is complete nonsense. So two thirds of the way through it\u2019s probably time for a bit of analysis. So far the film has pretty much hit the same note over and over again. That note being dick jokes. Away from that there have been a bit of casual misogyny and lols inspired by \u201cfunny accents\u201d, as well a reliance on celebrity cameos. It is staggering that this film caused an international incident. Ok, we\u2019re 1 hour 21 mins in and they\u2019re going to do the interview. Franco is back on board for the assassination after realizing North Korea is one big rotten egg. It\u2019s Frost/Nixon time. Stephen isn\u2019t feeling the liveblog. My advice: look at that picture of me wearing tinsel and try to imagine if we were doing this AS A JOKE. This Rogen sex scene is quite a lot like this bit from Lost In Translation, except with jokes about Americans having \u201cbig fat teeth\u201d. Rogen is having sex with Sook and Franco is finally realizing that North Korea is full of\u2026 rotten fruit. Looks like the assassination might be back on. We\u2019re about two hours on from The Interview\u2019s release and early reviews are starting to trickle in. There seems to be quite a debate raging about what this film Means For America. Discuss. This is just nonsense now. Franco stopped Rogen from getting Kim Jong-un with the second ricin strip, because they are now bros. Rogen is chatting up Sook. Ok the ricin guard just died. His head exploded. Genuinely gruesome. My colleague Olly Laughland is here now. He\u2019s written numerous articles about the Interview and looks gutted at how underwhelming it all is. Hear, hear! Oh wait\u2026 An hour in and Franco and Kim Jong-un are raving and hanging around with naked women. Their bromance has driven a wedge between Rogen and Francbro. Kim Jong-un is now having an existential crisis about leading his nation while playing basketball with Franco. Basketball, North Korea\u2026 where have I seen that combination before? Clearly, the excitement over this film is not universal. They\u2019re bonding over a shared love of Katy Perry now. This is actually quite funny. Ok. I\u2019m 53 minutes in and I\u2019m making a cup of tea. Franco is now hanging out with Kim Jong-un and firing rockets. They\u2019re getting along famously Rogen\u2019s been caught after he squashed the tiger and had to shove the replacement ricin strip up his bum. I can\u2019t believe I just wrote that sentence. So we\u2019re 46 minutes in and I think it\u2019s fair to say this film is about as funny and satirical as Kevin And Perry Go Large, for non-British readers; this is what I\u2019m talking about - Ok, something is happening. Rogen is face to face with a tiger. Those dictators and their pets, eh? The man\u2019s got a point. If you wanna be paranoid, we\u2019ve got info for how to watch The Interview elsewhere here, in case you are the only person on the internet who has not yet found it. So the ricin plan has gone awry. Franco put the strip in a chewing gum packet and one of the guards ate it! I wonder what will happen now, no genuinely. I have no idea The slightly incongruous music keeps coming, with some Wu Tang Clan playing as the pair go to some sort of castle. They are now in Pyongyang, where Franco is giving a Rocky-style speech to the North Koreans: We\u2019re into a training montage now where the pair are given code names (\u201cdung beetle\u201d and \u201caardvark\u201d), and given fancy watches just like in James Bond. Hey, Breaking Bad fans, Ricin is what they\u2019re going to use to kill the big man. Franco is now proposing how he\u2019d kill Kim Jong-un. He somehow manages to work in a porno reference. This is 50% cameos, 50% dick jokes. Bit late for that now, Seth. But just in case you do want to watch The Interview the old fashioned way, here is a state-by-state list of US theaters that will be screening it. We\u2019re now at CIA headquarters in Langley where they play Usher tracks, apparently\u2026 The pair aren\u2019t so sure if regime change is a wise idea, but agent Lacey reassures them they\u2019ll ensure the new guys won\u2019t be the wrong type of dictator. WARNING: at exactly 27 minutes in Franco has a fake erection after discussing how hot agent Lacey is. Is there a way to re-ban this film? Now agent Lacey (Lizzy Caplan from Masters of Sex) is asking them to \u201ctake out\u201d Jong-un. Quizzical looks abound before the penny drops. They need to assassinate the leader of North Korea! People appear to be too busy taking selfies with The Interview to actually watch it. Warning for those watching this later on, at 23.30 Franco tells a prolonged joke about how much his penis smells. I\u2019d rather be doing the washing up right now. For no reason at all the pair have just boshed some drugs and got turnt up. Bad move, because the next morning a couple of feds are at their door. Here comes the recruitment pitch\u2026 In Franco outfit news, he\u2019s now sporting an emerald cardigan and a mint green tie. It\u2019s a new low. Because it\u2019s been the kind of year in which the president of the United States, leader of the free world, is supposed to have an opinion on the release of a terrible movie... the president of the United States has an opinion on the release of a terrible movie. Here\u2019s a statement put out this afternoon by White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz: The President welcomes the news that people will be able to decide for themselves whether or not to see this film, and appreciates Sony\u2019s work on this effort over the past few weeks. As the President made clear on Friday, we do not live in a country where a foreign dictator can start imposing censorship here in the United States. With today\u2019s announcements, people can now make their own choices about the film, and that\u2019s how it should be. 2015 can\u2019t come fast enough. Skylark just announced that in three weeks he\u2019ll be interviewing Kim Jong-un, which leads nicely into a segment where Seth Meyers and Bill Maher quip about the prospect. The cameo levels here are incredible. So far the film has been about 50 per cent cameos. North Korea is now being compared to Mordor, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt just had a cameo which saw him stroke a cat. Franco\u2019s now wearing a suit that makes him look like Jack Nicholson from Batman. He\u2019s now shouting at a helicopter as it departs and talking about the fact he finds the North Korean solider/shouty woman Sook (played by Diana Bang) sexy. So Rogen walked up a mountain to meet the North Koreans, fell asleep, was crawled on by a bug and then, when he was told he could have a meeting with the big man, made a joke about Skype. It\u2019s raining outside. James Franco is doing some social media self promotion of his own for The Interview\u2019s big debut: If you take a photo of yourself watching The Interview, he will \u201clike\u201d it. That\u2019s nice, but we\u2019ll go one step farther: as we mentioned earlier in this blog, if you tweet @GuardianUS or @KaylaEpstein a photo or Vine of yourself watching The Interview, we\u2019ll feature you here, in our live blog. The comment thread is heating up. Not a lot of laughs here either \u2026 except for this one We\u2019re 17 minutes in and so far this has been utterly stupid. Ok. He\u2019s in China, marveling at people eating octopus as he goes to meet the North Koreans. On a mountain. But he\u2019s on the phone with a North Korean diplomat. He needs to knock that off, pronto. Rogen\u2019s doing a west Indian accent. I think. Not a film to miss a chance for a good ol\u2019 celebrity in daft situation joke, now a producer has revealed Matthew McConaughey has just been outed for having sex with a goat, lol. Haters gonna hate We apologize for nothing. Literally, 10 seconds after Rogen was complaining about not being able to do \u201creal journalism\u201d it\u2019s revealed that Kim Jong-un is a massive fan and wants to do an interview with them. Franco\u2019s cravat is a thing of wonder. Looks a bit like an Urban Outfitters Navajo-style rug Ok, Franco and Rogbro are having a chat about why they always cover salacious nonsense in their show such as \u201cNicki Minaj\u2019s vagina flopping out at the Grammys\u201d. I wonder where this is going to lead? Worthwhile journalism such as being recruited to try and assassinate a world leader, perhaps\u2026 Skylark is now chatting to Rob Lowe. I wonder if he\u2019s going to take his wig off to reveal a horrible head of hairlessness. Oh, he just did. I realise I\u2019ve not given you any context about this film at all and just rushed into spouting off sentences that make little sense. Here\u2019s a handy summary of who the main characters are from Jordan Hoffman\u2019s excellent review: Both Rogen and Franco, who have marvellous chemistry and exude good cheer, continue to tweak their personas in this very amusing, very imbecilic film. Rogen (who co-directs with longtime creative partner Evan Goldberg) is Aaron Rapoport, a producer of TV news infotainment. He\u2019s hitched his wagon to David Skylark (Franco) a boastful, possibly bisexual airhead who knows his handsome smile will excuse him from life\u2019s problems. OK, got it. Good. If you\u2019re watching along, I\u2019m exactly 9.50 into this thing. Seth Rogen has a massive, crestfallen look on his face at this point after having an existential crisis about not being a \u201creal journalist\u201d. I know EXACTLY how he feels. Now Skylark is wearing a cravat and opining about his colleagues and using Lord of the Rings references while doing a Golem impression. I feel like I\u2019m inside the mind of a frat bro. Now Franco is reading clearly homoerotic lyrics back to Eminem. THIS IS SATIRE. The moment we worried would never come has finally arrived. Are you going to be watching at 1PM ET? Come and join us by tweeting your thoughts, photos and Vines of your watch party or whatever @GuardianUS and we\u2019ll pull the best contributions into the live blog. It\u2019ll be like one big rowdy midnight release party, except it\u2019s the middle of the afternoon and most of us are still in pajamas. You can also contact myself and my co-pilot with extended thoughts about the film on Twitter and email: Lanre Bakare: @Lanre_Bakare | lanre.bakare@theguardian.com Kayla Epstein: @KaylaEpstein | kayla.epstein@theguardian.com Eminem just said the phrase \u201cgay peek-a-boo\u201d. This scene is a lot like when Zane Lowe talked to Eminem, except he just said he was gay, a statement which is making James Franco pull a very very funny face. Dave Skylark (James Franco) is sporting an orange tie and a HUGE grin. And Eminem is there too talking about how he hates old people. WOW this is controversial. Brian Williams is here, too, being funny. A young girl is singing a nationalistic song of triumph with the classic line \u201cDie America, Die!\u201d The tone is set. First things first, let\u2019s watch a trailer for The Interview. Talk about preaching to the choir. OK. PayPal done. YouTube on. Let\u2019s watch this thing. Someone who won\u2019t be joining us on this journey is Dennis Rodman who wants you to go watch his film about North Korea instead: \u201cIf you want to see the real thing and what really goes on there, go see the screening of my documentary \u2018Big Bang in Pyongyang\u2019 at the Slamdance film festival at the end of January,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be EPIC!\u201d Good old Rodman. At the moment I\u2019m trying to download and pay for the thing, which is harder than you\u2019d expect \u2026 Lanre here, ready for the cinematic event of the century, as long as the Sony site doesn\u2019t fall over with all the people attempting to download The Interview at the same time. Sony has FINALLY released The Interview online. Come join us as we document the experience in real time. Ready or not, here we go ..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
