One after the other, they held out a hand to a local tattoo artist who pushed a rice-grain sized implant into the flesh between the thumb and forefinger. The 41 employees who opted into the procedure received complimentary t-shirts that read \u201cI Got Chipped\u201d. This wholesale implant event, organized by company management, dovetailed with Three Square Market\u2019s longer-term vision of a cashless payment system for their vending machines \u2013 workplace snacks purchased with a flick of the wrist. And the televised \u201cchipping party\u201d proved to be a savvy marketing tactic, the story picked up by media outlets from Moscow to Sydney. But not all of the attention was positive. After the event, comments on Three Square Market\u2019s Facebook page urged employees to quit. The company\u2019s Google reviews page was inundated with one-star ratings. And Christian groups \u2013 convinced that the implants fulfilled an end-of-days prophecy where people are branded with \u201cthe mark of the beast\u201d \u2013 accused the company of being the antichrist. Jowan \u00d6sterlund, a Swedish tattooist and body piercing specialist whose company Biohax provided Three Square Market with the microchips, watched with interest. For \u00d6sterlund, microchip implants were not radical or even novel. He had lived with one for years and had implanted hundreds of other young, tech-savvy Swedes. For this community, the chip signified a seamless integration of biology and technology. They used the implants to gain access to their co-working spaces, pay for gym memberships, and even ride the train. With Biohax, \u00d6sterlund was hoping to introduce this concept to a global market. Three Square Market was a test case, the first company in the US to offer implants to employees on a public stage. But the highly charged reaction, which linked the devices not only to pernicious surveillance but to a vision of tech-apocalypse, raised a question that \u00d6sterlund is still grappling with: is the world ready for technology to get under the skin? \u2022\u2022\u2022 Microchip implants are essentially cylindrical bar codes that, when scanned, transmit a unique signal through a layer of skin. Mostly, they have been used to organize products or warehouses or identify livestock and stray pets, though there has been some human experimentation. In 1998, Kevin Warwick, a professor of cybernetics at Reading University, had a chip implanted in his hand both to demonstrate that it was possible, and as a way of exploring the transhumanist idea that fusing technology with the body is the next step in humanity\u2019s evolution. \u00d6sterlund first became aware of microchipping technology several years after Warwick\u2019s project, when his friend made a copy of his dog\u2019s chip and implanted it under his own skin. They were both part of the body modification scene in Sweden and frequently experimented with new techniques, such as branding and septum piercing. \u201cThe dog chip was kind of a practical joke, so that when my friend went to the vet he could be identified as his own pet labrador, or whatever,\u201d \u00d6sterlund told me. \u201cBut the idea of doing something more with implants stuck with me.\u201d In 2013, \u00d6sterlund stumbled upon a German company selling industrial-grade microchips online. Unlike the chips used in pets, which can only transmit a single identification number, these devices were enabled with a communications protocol called NFC, which can be programmed to perform simple tasks. \u00d6sterlund ordered a batch and wrote a basic program that paired his Samsung 5 to the microchip, so that it would automatically call his wife when he picked up the phone. On the first implant attempt, \u00d6sterlund accidentally broke the tiny fuse in the chip while sterilizing it. But the second attempt stuck \u2013 when he touched his phone, it automatically triggered a call to his wife. \u201cIt was like my body was online,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my very own Johnny Mnemonic moment.\u201d Excited, \u00d6sterland reached out to a friend called Hannes Sj\u00f6blad, who was associated with the transhumanist community in Sweden. Sj\u00f6blad was impressed with \u00d6sterland\u2019s experiment and invited him to hold a demonstration at Epicenter, a tech-focused co-working space in Stockholm where Sj\u00f6blad was the \u201cchief disruption officer\u201d. Other young innovators and startup founders at Epicenter were intrigued with \u00d6sterlund\u2019s implant, and soon, he and Sj\u00f6blad were hosting \u201cchips and beer\u201d evenings. \u00d6sterlund would implant microchips over alcoholic beverages and share ideas about what new cyborg applications were possible. \u201cIn no time, Epicenter was updated to be biochip compatible and suddenly we were opening the front door and printing documents with the implants,\u201d Sj\u00f6blad told me. \u201cIt was all community-based development and it was super exciting.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Today, \u00d6sterlund and Sj\u00f6blad have their own microchip-focused businesses. \u00d6sterlund\u2019s Biohax is aiming to simplify identity and access in the digital world, offering a replacement to the seemingly endless collection of passwords, keys, tickets, cards that clutter our lives. \u201cWith the chip, it\u2019s all in this one tiny device that is impossible to lose,\u201d he said. Sj\u00f6blad\u2019s business, Dsruptive, which is based out of a university in southern Sweden, approaches microchipping as an extension of the wearable health tracking industry. Sj\u00f6blad believes that by placing a device under the skin, instead of wearing it like a Fitbit, data collection will be greatly improved. \u201cSwipe it with an iPhone and you will be able to get your blood oxygenation, temperature profile, heart rate patterns, breathing patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cFor people who want to optimize their health, this would be a game changer.\u201d There are other companies pushing the limits of what microchip implants can do, most notably the Seattle-based Dangerous Things, which sells a variety of bio-enabled devices, including multi-colored LED lights that light up beneath the skin. But \u00d6sterlund believes that Sweden will be the focal point of cyborg innovation. \u201cThe national railway is already compatible with my chips and as a country we are planning to be totally cashless by 2023,\u201d he told me. \u201cI guess here you can see an example of how it can be done.\u201d But Urs Gasser, executive director at Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, believes scaling up beyond the Swedish tech-hub environment to a broader market will be more legally and ethically tenuous than \u00d6sterlund might expect. \u201cThis experiment has so far happened in a wealthy country, among very digitally savvy people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while having a chip may play out nicely for well-educated people in Sweden who are part of a digital hub, I question how this will play out for, say, a worker in a warehouse.\u201d Indeed, Gasser believes that many people reacted negatively to Three Square Market\u2019s highly publicized chipping event because it symbolized power imbalances in the workplace, conjuring dystopian images of an authoritarian employer dehumanizing and controlling workers. \u201cSeeing employees get implanted at the workplace made people question what it means to be an employee,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you a person being paid for your work, or are you the property of the company you work for?\u201d Ifeoma Ajunwa, professor of labor and employment law at Cornell University, adds that it is crucial to consider the implications of microchipping technology in the context of increasing worker surveillance. In a 2016 paper, Limitless Worker Surveillance, Ajunwa and her co-authors, Kate Crawford and Jason Schultz, argued that new data collection methods \u2013 tracking internet history, DNA testing, collection of health data as part of workplace wellness programs \u2013 not only provide employers a more intimate data profile of their employees at the workplace but bleed into their private and internal lives. Microchips, Ajunwa says, will deepen and intensify this dynamic. They \u201chave the potential for constant and intimate surveillance \u2013 they literally go with the worker wherever the worker goes. This seems to blur the line between work and family life.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Concerns about how microchipping might be implemented in the coming years have also been raised by a number of US lawmakers, including Skip Daly, a Democrat in the Nevada state assembly, who, in March, introduced a bill to make involuntary microchipping illegal in the state. Arkansas, New Jersey and Tennessee are also drafting legislation centered around implants. (In a company statement, Three Square Market was careful to emphasize that its \u201cchipping party\u201d was entirely voluntary.) But according to Ajunwa, because labor laws in the US often skew in favor of the employer, workers can still be subject to coercion when it comes to surveillance tech. In 2015, for example, a woman was fired after she deleted an employee tracking app that recorded her movements, even when she was not at work. In another recent case, an employer was found to have demanded employees provide DNA samples for genetic testing after human feces was found in their workplace. Ajunwa says that in the absence of clear labor regulations that prevent workplace pressure to submit to surveillance, \u201cemployees might feel pressured to say yes to microchips even if they have reservations\u201d. When I raised these concerns with \u00d6sterlund, he said that for microchipping to scale successfully, new legal frameworks, particularly around informed consent, were essential. In fact, part of the reason he believes Swedes have been early adopters of microchipping is because of stronger labor regulations and data protection laws, such as Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which he believes creates an atmosphere of trust between government and society, employer and worker. Yet, both he and Sj\u00f6blad also presume that much of the fear elicited by microchips is founded less on privacy concerns and more on irrational prejudices against implants. \u201cMicrochips are inert and passive, basically like swipe cards that you can\u2019t lose,\u201d \u00d6sterlund said. \u201cSo I find it ironic when people with an iPhone and a Gmail account get on Facebook to scream about privacy just because they\u2019re freaked out by the incision.\u201d That we respond to new technologies in an emotional or psychological way, though, is unavoidable, particularly when body modification is involved. For Gasser, these emotional responses should not be immediately dismissed as superstitious or illogical. \u201cThe fear we feel in relation to microchips is less about a particular technology and more about that technology in the context of power and uneven power structures, like employer and worker,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when those dynamics are implanted in our bodies, there is a line we cross that simply feels different.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
