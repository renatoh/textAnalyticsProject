But then, I'm not interested in normal human behaviour. I'm here, in Coed Llandegla, Wales, ahead of International Dawn Chorus Day, to learn from Bafta-winning wildlife sound recordist Chris Watson about the best way to capture the magic of a dawn chorus. We arrive well before sunrise \u2014 and before the birds are vocal \u2014 to set up microphones. That way the birds get used to their presence, rather than \"spooked\" in to silence later by seeing us put them in place. Then we hide ourselves away in a more sheltered part of the forest, at the other end of very long cables, headphones at the ready. And wait. That first call \u2014 perhaps a distant tawny owl \u2014 is so lonely and beautiful that the criminally early start to the day suddenly seems worthwhile. The part of my recording featured here was taken in a small clearing of this coniferous forest, and documents the loudest part of that day's chorus, at roughly 5.45am. You can also hear drops of rain and dew falling in to little pools nearby. As for the range of birds, I'm still learning to recognise their songs and calls \u2014 so perhaps some experienced twitchers out there can help me out \u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
