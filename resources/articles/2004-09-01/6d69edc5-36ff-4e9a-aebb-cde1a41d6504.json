Philippe Varin, the chief executive, acknowledged however that the group still had further improvements to make if it is to match its European rivals. In the first half of the year Corus turned an operating loss of \u00a357m into a profit of \u00a3147m, with the recovery driven by an equal combination of soaring world steel prices and its own internal recovery programme. The news helped the shares climb 2.5p to 52p - despite a private placement of some 100m Corus shares - the equivalent of some 2.25% of the company. Corus said it did not know who had sold the shares or whether they had gone to a single buyer. City sources said, however, they believed the stake had been sold to a number of buyers. Commenting on the first-half performance, Mr Varin said the results showed a substantial improvement and that the group expected margins and operating profits to continue to improve in the second half. But he added: \"We have to keep our feet on the ground, we still have a long way to go. \"We have to lay the foundations for the future growth of the company.\" The group has already been helped by surging global steel demand - led by China and the United States - which has transformed an industry used to growth of 2-3% a year into one that saw demand climb 6% in 2002, 7% last year and an estimated 7-9% this year. Although the surge in demand has sent iron ore and coal pricing spiralling higher, Corus has been able to more than offset the increases through higher steel prices. So far it has pushed up prices by up to 50% this year through a series of increases and is likely to see margins improve even further next year, when it renegotiates contracts covering about 40% of its order book. As well as the improvement in the steel industry's economic fundamentals, Corus is pressing on with its \"restoring success\" programme - which is designed to deliver \u00a3680m of benefits for the group by the end of 2006. As part of the Corus restructuring programme the company is still planning to sell its aluminium business, having overcome opposition from the Dutch trade unions, although it acknowledged yesterday the disposal was unlikely to take place this year. Corus is also negotiating the sale of a controlling stake of its Teesside plant, which produces steel slab, and said yesterday it was in talks with a number of interested parties. They are thought to include the Swiss steel trading group Duferlo and CSN, a Brazilian company, although Corus declined to give details. If a deal does go through, however, Corus is expected to retain a stake of about 25% in order to retain a degree of control over output from the Teesside plant. Yesterday's results were better than the City had been expecting, with analysts looking for earnings from the company - before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation - of between \u00a3700m and \u00a3800m for the full year. The steel union, Community, said the results showed the need to expand steel production in the UK, rather than cut it back. \"Should Corus re-evaluate its strategy and take further advantage of the changed market conditions, this really could be a new dawn for the company.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
