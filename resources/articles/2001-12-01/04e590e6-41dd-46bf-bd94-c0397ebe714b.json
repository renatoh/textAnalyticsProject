I want to be No1 on both sides of the Atlantic; it is my main goal.\" Garcia spoke quietly but confidently as he outlined ambitions that have been far beyond Severiano Ballesteros, Sandy Lyle, Nick Faldo and Jose Maria Olazabal, all of whom have competed on both tours in the past. Olazabal, in 1994, the year he first won the US Masters and followed it with a World Series victory, came closest, finishing fourth in Europe and seventh - despite playing only eight events - in the US. Lyle had a practically identical record in 1988, the year he won the Phoenix Open and then the Greater Greensboro Open and the US Masters back-to-back. He topped the US money list for 133 days but by the end of the year had slipped to seventh. In Europe, on a limited schedule, he finished fifth. Neither Ballesteros nor Faldo, nor indeed Ian Woosnam, Bernhard Langer, Lee Westwood or Darren Clarke, has come remotely close to the target set by Garcia. However, four of the young Spaniard's order of merit events in 2002 will be the majors, three the lucrative World Golf Championships and the remaining four, with the possible exception of the Spanish Open, tournaments with huge prize money. \"If I could win a major, a WGC event and one other counting event,\" he says, \"that could be good enough for the order of merit.\" This season that would have netted him in the region of \u00a32.5m, some \u00a3700,000 more than the order of merit winner, the US Open champion Retief Goosen. To be No1 in America, of course, Garcia has first to topple Tiger Woods, but he is far from intimidated. \"Of course he is catchable,\" he says. \"I strongly feel I am closer to him than before. Part of it is the ball - it is going so far that his length is not the advantage it was when he first came out - but part of it is his own fault. He has reset the bar and we are all having to work harder to get better. That is thanks to him.\" Garcia does not go along with the David Duval theory that Woods, who won only the Masters this past year, expended all his mental energies in taking that major, his fourth in a row. \"I don't think Tiger is like that,\" the Spaniard says. \"He would never win anything and then say, 'I'm done, that's it.' After the Masters he was dying to win the US Open, the Open and the PGA so that he could say, 'I've won seven on the trot.' \" He goes on: \"Everyone thinks it looks like a bad year for Tiger because he played badly in the last three majors, but just look back at the last three years. The only question is if he can maintain that level for his whole life.\" Garcia himself had what, by pre-Tiger standards, was a sensational year. Imagine the hype he would be prompting if Woods were not around, for in winning twice on the US Tour he established himself firmly in the world's top 10. Then he went to Europe and in Paris, at the Lancome Trophy, he was four behind the leader, Goosen, with four to play but won it with birdies at all four holes. And he went on to win the Million Dollar Challenge in Sun City, chipping in to beat Ernie Els in a play-off. All that and he is not 22 until January 9. \"It has been a good year for me,\" Garcia admits. \"I have learned a lot.\" He feels that he has more shots, that he can \"work\" the ball either left or right at will, under pressure, and he is learning how to control the huge amount of backspin he gets when playing to the usually soft greens he encounters on the US tour. \"Mostly, though,\" he says, \"I have learned that, if you do not ask yourself to give as much as you can, you will not get close. I realised at Pebble Beach in the 2000 US Open, when Tiger was 12 under and no one else was under par, that it was no good saying to yourself, 'Let's make par, let's make par, let's hit another green and another,' because if you achieve that you will probably three-putt the next green, and then where are you?\" Garcia is unconcerned about his habit of regripping the club at the address position, which has escalated to the point where he does it up to 16 times. \"I know what's going on,\" he says, \"and it's nothing to do with nerves. I know how to control it and it's no big deal. I am thinking about the shot and what I need to do, that's all. \"Anyway, Jack Nicklaus used to waggle the club forever and look up to the target and back down again forever, and you would wonder if he was ever going to hit. All I am doing is getting ready to hit, and when I'm ready I'll hit.\" If that sounds cocky, it was not said like that and Garcia, in essence, is not a cocky kid. He was talking while taking part in a tin-pot tournament on an Alicante course more building site than greenbelt - playing only so that he could be with the friends he had grown up with. His table that evening, perhaps 20 strong, was alight with infectious laughter as, surrounded by family and fellow players, Garcia got in some serious relaxation. He will need all he can get if he is to get even close to what seems an impossible dream.
