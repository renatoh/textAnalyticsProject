Her affection for the program\u2019s cast of puppets, for Elmo in particular, is so aggressive and pure that her parents have to restrict her access to it because she gets so wired after watching it she can\u2019t function for days. Aubrey, whose real name her parents asked be withheld to protect her privacy, is a 16-year-old student in Los Angeles. As a teenager living with autism, routine is the bedrock of her day. But in the days of a spiraling coronavirus crisis, predicting what comes next is all but impossible. \u201cThink about how we are with uncertainty and multiply it by a million. For her not knowing is almost unbearable,\u201d said her father, Pirouz Kavehpour. Today, with 124,000 of the nation\u2019s schools closed due to coronavirus, Kavehpour has joined the ranks of millions of parents turned into homeschool teachers overnight \u2013 no easy feat for any working parent, but especially challenging for parents whose children have disabilities. It remains unclear when schools across the country will reopen; California officials already indicated they won\u2019t restart this academic year and a handful of other states have closed doors until fall. And as classrooms pivot to online learning, many of the services guaranteed to the nation\u2019s roughly 7 million children with disabilities have been effectively put on hold. Federal law promises to give students educational services that address individual needs. But it\u2019s unclear when children with disabilities will get the kind of face-to-face help they had been getting at school before. Struggling for support At school, a personal aid redirects Aubrey when she gets distracted and helps her manage emotions. A speech therapist works to improve her speech and draws her out of quiet isolation. An occupational therapist helps her keep her body calm so she doesn\u2019t regress to rocking back and forth. But in recent weeks, those tasks have fallen on Kavehpour, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at UCLA. Aubrey\u2019s mother Faranak, who lives separately, has been quarantined at home after contracting coronavirus. She hasn\u2019t been able to help, or even see her daughter, except through video calls. Under quarantine, she\u2019s noticed Aubrey has seemed increasingly concerned about her mother\u2019s health. \u201cShe keeps saying, \u2018Mommy, go to doctor.\u2019\u201d As schools closed and officials turned out the schoolhouse lights, educators from New York to Washington were forced to overhaul education plans, with many leaning into technology such as Google Classroom to share assignments, or Zoom as a way to hold virtual office hours. Those online classes may be broadly helpful for a traditional student, but Aubrey doesn\u2019t work well independently, and Kavehpour said it\u2019s become a herculean task to keep her on top of her homework \u2013 which, even under normal circumstances, might take a whole afternoon to coax her to do. Owing to mixed signals from the federal government on how to proceed, in addition to concerns over liability for not being able to provide mandatory services, many school districts struggle to provide the support students like Aubrey will need in the months to come. The extent to which children and students with disabilities receive help may, for the moment, rely on the creativity of school district officials, teachers and parents. As districts pivoted to online learning, education leaders turned to the US department of education, headed by the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, to know how to proceed on serving schools\u2019 most vulnerable students. That guidance was slow to arrive. And when it came, educators and advocates found the direction vague and contradictory. As late as 16 March, guidance issued by federal education officials indicated that school districts don\u2019t have to provide specialized services to students with disabilities if schools are closed for everyone \u2013 the idea being that all students are served equally if nobody is served at all. \u201cIf a school district closes its schools and does not provide any educational services to the general student population, then a school would not be required to provide services to students with disabilities during that same period of time,\u201d read a fact sheet from the education department\u2019s office of civil rights. Special education advocates fired back, arguing that the directives contradicted the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Idea), which promises that students with disabilities will have access to free education tailored to their needs. \u201cIt is our view that this guidance was wrong,\u201d said Miriam Rollin, an attorney and director of the Education Civil Rights Alliance. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in Idea that says you\u2019re absolved of responsibility for serving students with [disabilities] when schools close.\u201d Amid the backlash, the department shifted course, telling school districts they cannot keep schools closed to sidestep the mandate to serve all students. \u201cWe remind schools they should not opt to close or decline to provide distance instruction, at the expense of students, to address matters pertaining to services for students with disabilities,\u201d read the newer fact sheet issued on 21 March. The new guidance clarified schools\u2019 responsibilities, Rollin said, but the wait came with a cost. \u201cHad the department just released guidance to begin with, it would have been easier. Unfortunately, schools lost precious time to plan and prepare,\u201d she said. Neither did the advice clear all uncertainties, including the question of how and when school districts make up the hours of help they owe children. The US Department of Education did not immediately return requests for comment. In California, officials wanted more assurance from the federal government they would be protected from lawsuits filed by parents whose children don\u2019t get mandated special education services, something that\u2019s happened after wildfires shut down schools in the past. Meghann Hughes, a special education teacher in San Diego, said teachers in her network have been scrambling to share resources on how to best help students with disabilities in the absence of clear directives from officials. \u201cWe\u2019re just being very creative, jumping into the fire and calling for help from our colleagues,\u201d she said. She added that much of the chatter among the 10,000 members of a Facebook group for the California Teachers Association, one of the largest teachers unions in the country, has consisted of educators\u2019 pinging each other frantic questions on how to move forward. San Diego Unified, where Hughes teaches, is currently on spring break, but plans to resume online classes on 6 April, with special education services to resume on 27 April. But Hughes said teachers were still unclear about what will happen to the face-to-face services students with disabilities typically received. \u201cThis is crisis teaching. This is incredibly traumatic. A lot of parents have been laid off, so those families are insecure, if they weren\u2019t already. And I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to provide a lot of these services through the internet,\u201d said Hughes. For the moment, the official guidance for school districts boils down to making a good-faith effort to provide the education services students need. \u201cNobody thinks that education in the realm of coronavirus is going to look the same as it did. Nobody thinks that. But you have to try, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing now,\u201d Rollin said. \u201cThe bottom line is: do everything that you can, be creative, use all the tools in your toolbox.\u201d Dan Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, whose members include school superintendents from around the nation, said he had received the same message in phone calls with DeVos and Vice-President Mike Pence. \u201cYou can\u2019t say 100% of kids will be served through online instruction, because it\u2019s not possible,\u201d Domenech said, adding that the nature of a contagious virus complicates matters. \u201cObviously, we\u2019ve got a pandemic that we\u2019re dealing with that prevents teachers going to students\u2019 homes,\u201d he said. He has advised school officials to document efforts to serve all students, taking note of whatever circumstances prevent them from doing so, and to make up the time owed students as soon as possible. \u201cIt may result in lawsuits. It may result in not being in compliance. But the alternative is to do nothing. And that\u2019s not an acceptable outcome,\u201d Domenech said. \u2018Flexibility is key\u2019 In Los Angeles, Aubrey and her parents are adjusting to the new normal, finding ways to carve out structure while staying flexible enough to account for an unpredictable moment. As it happens, the creators of Aubrey\u2019s TV show have been huddling to create programming that helps children and parents strike the same balance. \u201cFlexibility is the key word,\u201d said Rosemarie Truglio, vice-president of curriculum and content for Sesame Street. \u201cAll children do best with structure, but we also need to be flexible if plans go awry. Building resiliency is key. And that\u2019s what this is all about. We don\u2019t know how long this is going to last. We all have to be resilient.\u201d In that way, the advice isn\u2019t much different than official education guidance for parents, teachers and children. As for Aubrey, she would be thrilled to know she appeared in an article alongside leaders from Sesame Street, her father said. Since she last watched, Sesame Street has gotten a new character, Julia, who has autism, too. But the jury is out on when Aubrey will be able to see Julia on screen for the first time. Her love for the show is simply too powerful for her own good. \u201cIt may sound funny, but for her Sesame Street is like a narcotic,\u201d said her mom. \u201cIt\u2019s a compliment to the show, but for her, it\u2019s best to stay away completely.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
