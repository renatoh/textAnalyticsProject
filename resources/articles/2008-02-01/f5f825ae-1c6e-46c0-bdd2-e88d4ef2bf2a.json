There are no surprises -- it's just what you'd expect them to say -- but Johnson says: Our proposal includes a thoughtful integration planning process for a Microsoft-Yahoo! combination. It is important to me that this process includes leaders from Yahoo! and Microsoft and is done in a way that enables us, together, to make decisions in a collaborative way. Importantly, this will be an inclusive process with Yahoo! employees as they are a key part of our success as a combined company. The consolidation may not involve many lay-offs: While some overlap is expected in any combination of this size, we should remember that Microsoft is a growth company that has hired over 20,000 people since 2005, and we would look to place talented employees throughout the company as a whole. We have no shortage of business and technical opportunities, and we need great people to focus on them. And there would still be some sort of Yahoo in Silicon Valley: Silicon Valley is one of Microsoft's largest presences outside our Redmond headquarters, with nearly 1,800 employees in a variety of key engineering and business roles. Yahoo!'s campus houses over 10,000 employees and plays a key part in their innovative culture. In bringing the companies together, we would be committed to maintaining Yahoo!'s significant presence in Silicon Valley, and we anticipate that there would be exciting opportunities for a combined Microsoft and Yahoo! talent base in Silicon Valley, Redmond, and many other cities worldwide. How many of Yahoo's best staff will stick around to find out how well Microsoft can execute its plan, if it ever comes to that, is another matter. It would be interesting to know how many Yahoo staff have previously applied for jobs at Microsoft, and therefore might quite like the idea. I suspect not many."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
