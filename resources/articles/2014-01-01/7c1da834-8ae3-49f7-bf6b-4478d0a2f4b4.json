Both have difficult matches and both have been scheduled to play in the opening session on Monday: Watson, who came through qualifying stylishly, meets the 31st seed, Daniela Hantuchova, and Robson has drawn the 18th seed, Kirsten Flipkens. Robson's physical concerns would seem to be the more worrying, after she pulled out of a tournament in Auckland then finished only a set and two games in Hobart. \"I just wasn't quite ready to play a match, and didn't want to make anything worse,\" she said. \"It was painful, but not so much anymore.\" Watson was similarly upbeat and clearly relieved to be back to full fitness after being devastated for most of 2013 by a disease that drains sufferers of all energy. \"I feel every match I play is a bonus,\" she said. \"It's horrible saying it but it's kind of the truth. I was used to losing, and going into matches thinking I was going to lose, so I lost the nerves. I love tennis and I could never stop or throw away a match. I still went out there and gave everything.\" Her motivation now is to recover from sliding to 121 in the world back to 39, where she was before the glandular fever struck. \"I am in a hurry and that's why I'm so motivated and taking every match so seriously. I've been there so I know I can get there and I can't wait to be back.\" If Watson does make any sort of impact here it will be through the rediscovery of her natural confidence and cool temperament. There is no sunnier presence on the circuit, and she was beaming on Saturday after beating the American Irina Falconi 6-4, 7-6 in her final qualifying match. \"Before the tournament, I was very nervous. More nervous than I usually am. But I was actually quite happy that I was nervous because last year I kind of lost those butterflies somewhere in the middle of the year. I've got it back now. I really want it.\" Robson is no less determined, but it is difficult to see how she can quickly overcome the handicap of playing a quality opponent such as Flipkens with one good wrist, given she depends a lot on the power of her two-fisted groundstrokes. \"It's just one of those things that a lot of tennis players have, and it just comes with the territory,\" she said. \"I practised points yesterday, today and I will do tomorrow, so I feel ready. I'm glad I got that set and a bit last week in Hobart. That always helps, when you know how to prepare. It was my first match with Jesse [Witten]. \"I spent my off-season with Nick [Saviano], and he's great. I first worked with him when I was 12. He's always been around and we've always chatted. I'll be in Florida quite a lot over the next year, and will continue doing my training with him.\" This is the latest of five training relationships she has had \u2013 and she will leave her teenage years behind her only in the second week of this tournament. \"Nick's a great coach,\" she said, \"and Jesse is someone great to travel with. I'd like to spend as much time as possible with them. But it's one of those things that you never know how it's going to work out.\" Such pragmatism might well take Robson further up the rankings this year, and she admits 2013 was a struggle for consistency after the heroics of the season before. Hiring the Americans and spending more time in Florida looks likely to introduce a more settled period in her young career, and she agrees that she has already addressed some tactical adjustments. \"I would like to come in [to the net] more. I've got the game for that. It's just picking the right shot to come in on. Jesse is a smart guy and he's had so much experience himself, playing for so many years. And he knows how everything works and it helps that he's really good to hit with. We've only done almost two months now. It seems to be going well and I'm happy with it.\" If Britain's two best players do manage to navigate their way through the challenging waters in their section of the draw (where lurk Serena Williams, Roberta Vinci, Ana Ivanovic and Robson's Canadian friend, Eugenie Bouchard), they have the incentive of meeting in the quarter-finals. As Andy Murray said of his own prospects here in returning from injury: \"Stranger things have happened.\" But not a lot stranger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
