The longueurs of a tedious meeting can be relieved by trying to identify the airlines among the continuous process of planes slowly descending westwards. Since September 11, of course, one pays a rather closer interest, not so much to the livery as to the nature of the flightpath. So far, the intensity of the traffic remains undiminished. Indeed, as the continuous stream of shiny metal glides towards the same spot on the distant horizon, one wonders how they can all find enough space on the ground when they arrive there. Which brings me naturally to the Research Assessment Exercise. The RAE is currently reaching its quinquennial climax. Back on the 28th floor, the panels are finalising their recommendations. Applause, laughter, even the popping of champagne corks echo across the office. We smile indulgently. Another final panel meeting: they deserve to let off some steam. After all, the panels have, absolutely without exception, undertaken a vast amount of work for no personal reward and in a spirit of selfless professionalism. Their contribution has been enormous. Meanwhile, far beyond Heathrow at the end of the M4, the results are being fed into the computer of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce), while in the world of academia at large, the atmosphere is, if anything, becoming hyperventilated. One is the cause of the other. As the results are compiled, it is becoming apparent that there will be a considerable improvement in performance. No one should be surprised by this. Indeed, no one is. Universities and colleges have actively managed their research base for nearly two decades now, focusing their resources selectively on the best-performing research teams and displacing those who are under-performing or not performing at all.Researchers are working harder and, if citation analyses are to be believed, more effectively. Research in the UK is genuinely world-class and is improving. The RAE results will reflect this. All of this may be difficult to discern when the results are announced at the turn of the year. The problem is that the outcomes are likely to be even better than anyone - certainly Hefce - predicted. In a typically British way, the comment, especially from the press, is unlikely to be celebratory. Instead, one anticipates a repeat of August A-level syndrome - sneering doubts cast upon the validity of the results and mutterings about falling standards - even though on this occasion, they will have been confirmed, at the top end, by international referees. In these circumstances, the panel members might understandably wonder why they have bothered. This is not to say, however, that the very success of the RAE will not create its own acute dilemmas. Successive improvement does not mean that the resources magically emerge to fund the presumed rewards. Yet if commensurate resources are not found, then sooner or later the incentive to excel will diminish. If the proportion of researchers in the highest grades exceeds a certain level, then we hit intractable \"ceiling effects\": the present funding formula becomes unsustainable. The existing RAE treadmill has to spin faster and faster just to stand still. Eventually the wheels will fly off. In the modern world, universities are the engines of the knowledge-based economy. Research is central to this. But so are other essential activities: teaching and learning, knowledge transfer, the broader contributions that all of higher education makes to civil society in our communities and regions. Research, still less the RAE, should not be allowed to distort behaviour and divert the sector from sustaining an overall balance of excellence across the range of activities that constitute higher education today. At the moment, the RAE is the only funding mechanism that relates performance to reward in any meaningful way. This cannot be desirable. We need to incentivise excellence and reward performance in areas other than basic and strategic research so that the RAE in the future will not be the exclusive focus of rewarding quality. All the higher education institutions in the UK should not be encouraged to fly towards the same distant point on the horizon. If they try, they will find there are not enough landing slots. Some will be left to go round and round in a perpetual holding pattern. There is no room to build another runway, nor the academic equivalent of Terminal 5. Better, surely, to look for the site of another airport and divert some flights there.
