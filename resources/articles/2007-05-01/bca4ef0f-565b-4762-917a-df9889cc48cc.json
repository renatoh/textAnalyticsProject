If it is a mark of a great football manager that they can win a championship with two different clubs, then winning a Derby from two different yards should carry similar acclaim for a racehorse trainer and Chapple-Hyam, who seemed lost to British racing just five years ago, is odds-on to do so when he sends Authorized to Epsom on Saturday. It is a comparison that Chapple-Hyam, a West Brom obsessive, would enjoy. \"I'm as wound-up about the play-off final as I am about the Derby,\" he said yesterday morning, shortly before setting off for Wembley. \"I had an ordinary ticket for the game, because that's what I like, being in with all the other fans, but West Brom have very kindly invited me to join them for the day, and I'm going to be in the Royal Box. Which is great, but I'm not sure what they'll think of the noise I'll make if West Brom score.\" Off with the hospitality brigade he may be but one of the most engaging things about Chapple-Hyam is that, again perhaps a little like Clough, he comes across as a man of the people. He has a double-barrelled name and being Robert Sangster's son-in-law certainly didn't impede his start in the game. He saddled the Derby favourite back in 1992, only to win the race with his \"second string\", Dr Devious, as Rodrigo De Triano finished down the field. Then, he was the master of Manton, Sangster's immense training establishment in Wiltshire, having been appointed as a virtual unknown less than 18 months earlier. \"I'm sure there were people who thought I'd got that job because of who I was and not what I could do,\" he says, \"but I can honestly say that it never bothered me once. I've got a thick skin and I just carry on with things. He was effectively sacked by Sangster in 1999, however, after a quiet 18 months, and left soon afterwards for a four-year spell in Hong Kong that was recently described in a trade paper as \"a disaster\". \"I thought that was a bit strong,\" he says. \"The first two years were hard but the next two I did all right and the last one was really good.\" Chapple-Hyam's second coming, at St Gatien Stables in Newmarket, started in 2004 and at the very bottom of the business. \"People forget about you quite quickly, but that's the nature of the game,\" he says. \"We were getting horses from claimers and we only had six or seven two-year-olds in our first year. I bought them all myself and luckily managed to find owners for all of them. \"It's definitely much more satisfying this time around, with horses I've picked and brought along myself. It's been a hard struggle, but it's the same as it's been for anyone else. \"Most people can train, but there's training and there's training. You have to know exactly how far you can push a horse without going too far, just enough to get him spot-on when it matters. And in a big race like the Derby, they can't just be cherry-ripe. They've got to be 200%, just like everybody else's.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
