But yesterday it emerged that Princes William and Harry travelled to their cousin's pre-wedding celebrations on the island by RAF Chinook. The \u00a310m helicopter was piloted by Prince William - currently on attachment to the RAF - who flew from RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire to Woolwich barracks in south London last Friday, where he picked up his brother. The pair then continued to the Isle of Wight's Bembridge airport, where they met Princess Anne's son, Peter Phillips, who is getting married next month. An RAF spokesman said the trip was a training exercise. \"Having spent a week under instruction with a Chinook helicopter squadron, Prince William flew a legitimate training sortie which tested his new skills to the limit,\" he said. The spokesman added that the prince's instructor had said: \"Prince William showed natural piloting skills and an ability to pick things up quickly ... he performed very well indeed.\" Hours before the flight, the prince, 25, received his RAF wings from his father, the Prince of Wales, at a ceremony at RAF Cranwell. William and Harry are officers in the Household Cavalry Regiment, but William's RAF attachment will be followed by another with the navy as a \"familiarisation\" process with all three services for his future role as the head of the armed forces."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
