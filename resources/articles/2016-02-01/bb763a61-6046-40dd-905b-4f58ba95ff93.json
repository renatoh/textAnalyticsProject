Yet again Australia\u2019s elite are celebrating a victory against their English counterparts in the World Club Series, and although this emphatic victory for the Roosters makes it 1-0 in the three-game series, the cumulative score in the two years of this embryonic competition is now 4-0. The platform for success was laid via a first-half Roosters performance that even the most ardent St Helens fan would have admired. At the heart of their performance was the young half-back Jayden Nikorima, who shone on this stage on his professional debut. Nikorima turned down a contract offer from the Brisbane coach Wayne Bennett to join the Roosters at the beginning of this year in search of regular first-team action, also walking away from the chance to pair up with older brother and New Zealand international Kodi at the Broncos in the coming years. The Nikorima brothers seemingly like England; Kodi played a starring role on his international debut during the Kiwis\u2019 victory against Steve McNamara\u2019s side in London late last year \u2013 and Jayden\u2019s debut was even better. After being beaten 39-0 in last year\u2019s World Club Challenge by the Roosters\u2019 city rivals South Sydney Rabbitohs, this was another grim and painful reminder for the Saints of how significant the jump up in class is in the NRL. Their forwards competed gamely throughout, but as in so many England v Australia games at international level down the years, the difference came in the skill levels and execution of the Australian side\u2019s backs division. \u201cI thought our middles were outstanding but the difference came in their outside-backs,\u201d said the St Helens coach, Keiron Cunningham. \u201cThey got a lot of tries against the run of play but they\u2019re a great side who can do some special things. If that\u2019s his [Nikorima\u2019s] debut, then he\u2019s going to be outstanding.\u201d Nikorima was withdrawn after three minutes because of a head knock but he returned to the field to find his side 6-0 up and with a lead they would never surrender. That try came courtesy of the forward Kane Evans after St Helens had forgotten the free play rule in the World Club Series did not exist, with Luke Walsh wasting a chance for the Saints to strike after Evans had earlier spilled the ball. From thereon the first half was one-way traffic, and with Nikorima at the heart of Sydney\u2019s play, they surged into a thoroughly merited 22-0 half-time lead. Tries from Aiden Guerra, Blake Ferguson and the pick of the bunch from Dale Copley \u2013 from a scintillating break and subsequent pass from none other than Nikorima \u2013 made it game over by half-time. To their credit, St Helens fought back well in the second half but the damage had long since been done. They at least avoided the ignominy of being whitewashed by NRL opposition for a second straight year courtesy of two well-taken tries from the centre Dominique Peyroux. Shaun Kenny-Dowall, Daniel Tupou and the try of the match from Guerra\u2019s second \u2013 a slick handling move that left the hosts with no answer, a familiar theme throughout the game \u2013 only further added to the procession. It illustrated the gulf in class between the sides \u2013 and probably the two competitions.
