The former shadow education secretary, who hoped to succeed Ed Miliband as leader in 2015, has been fiercely critical of Jeremy Corbyn and the direction in which he has taken the party. MPs close to Hunt confirmed he had decided to pursue a career outside politics, and had landed the plum post at one of London\u2019s most prestigious cultural institutions, where his predecessor Martin Roth was paid a salary of more than \u00a3145,000 as part of a total package worth at least \u00a3225,000. Hunt insisted his departure was not intended to \u201crock the boat\u201d. But he had been unhappy for some time, and his departure will add to the woes of Corbyn, who had a spat with his shadow defence secretary, Nia Griffith, over Britain\u2019s role in Nato earlier this week. The two men met to discuss Hunt\u2019s decision and sources close to the Labour leader said that they had \u201ca good conversation about the V&amp;A and culture\u201d. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said: \u201cI am disappointed to see a talented MP like Tristram step down. His departure will be keenly felt by parliament and by the Labour party but I know he will continue to champion Stoke-on-Trent\u2019s proud industrial heritage in his new role at the Victoria and Albert Museum. \u201cThe Labour party will move swiftly to ensure Stoke-on-Trent Central continues to be represented by a strong and capable Labour MP.\u201d Privately, Labour MPs expressed disappointment. One said: \u201cThis is a massive blow. Tristram was a friend and it\u2019s depressing he wants to leave.\u201d Corbyn said: \u201cI would like to thank Tristram Hunt for his service to the people of Stoke-on-Trent Central and to the Labour party. I wish him well in his future role at the V&amp;A.\u201d The central Stoke constituency, where Hunt won with a majority of 5,179 in 2015, is one of those where Ukip polled strongly, taking 22.7% of the vote to finish second. Ukip\u2019s new leader, Paul Nuttall, has stressed his determination to take on Labour in its former heartlands and could even stand himself in the byelection. As well as the V&amp;A post being his \u201cdream job\u201d, Hunt may have been swayed by the fact that his constituency is set to disappear entirely under the initial draft of boundary changes which will see the number of Commons seats fall from 650 to 600. The constituency would be split between the seats of Stoke-on-Trent North and South, among a series of proposed changes in the area. When the changes were announced, Hunt said they were based on outdated electoral data and were \u201ceffectively gerrymandering\u201d by the Conservatives. Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee will decide when the byelection will be held, but senior party insiders said it could be on the same day as the tough electoral test in Copeland, Cumbria, for the seat vacated by Jamie Reed, another Corbyn critic who resigned recently. Labour was pushed into irrelevance in the two most recent byelections. In Richmond Park, the Liberal Democrats won by attracting disgruntled remain voters; in Sleaford and North Hykeham, Labour slipped from second in the 2015 general election to fourth. But neither of those constituencies is in Labour\u2019s traditional heartlands. The Stoke contest is likely to offer the clearest barometer since the referendum of whether leave-voting Labour supporters still trust the party. Another will come in Leigh, Greater Manchester, if, as expected, Andy Burnham wins the Manchester mayoral race in May. The byelection could also create a fierce battle over selection, with Labour\u2019s deputy leader Watson and the GMB union, which represents many local ceramics workers, expected to take a keen interest. Corbyn\u2019s allies dominated the shortlisting committee for Copeland and have ruffled the feathers of some in the party by pushing for their preferred candidate, local campaigner Rachel Holliday, a relative newcomer to Labour. Hunt is far from alone among Labour MPs in being frustrated by the party\u2019s electoral prospects. Some insiders suggested more could follow his lead. But one backbencher close to him said most of his colleagues had dug in for the long haul. \u201cI think there are still flickers of hope; there\u2019s still a chance of this thing shifting and the cycle coming around,\u201d he said. Peter Mandelson, who was instrumental in helping Hunt to be selected for the seat before the 2010 general election, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great for him, but the rest of us have to stay and fight, fight and fight again to save the party we love.\u201d Hunt\u2019s appointment at the V&amp;A \u2013 which was confirmed by the prime minister and the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, Karen Bradley \u2013 was a genuine surprise. His name did not crop up in any of the art world gossip which generally precedes big appointments in the sector. Instead, the most regularly heard tips had been Luke Syson, the former National Gallery curator who is now in charge of European sculpture and decorative arts at the Met in New York; Tim Knox, formerly at Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum in London and now in charge of the Fitzwilliam in Cambridge; and Tim Reeve, the extremely able deputy director of the V&amp;A who has been acting director since Martin Roth\u2019s departure. There were warm words from senior figures in the art world at Hunt\u2019s appointment. The Art Fund\u2019s director, Stephen Deuchar, called Hunt\u2019s appointment \u201ca very clever choice\u201d. He said: \u201cI think it is an inspired choice, I really do. He is a great communicator and he is really committed to the social purposes and potential of museums and visual culture more generally.\u201d Hunt may not have run a museum before but Deuchar, who once ran Tate Britain, said that was not essential: \u201cHe knows the UK museum scene better than a lot of museum professionals, I dare say. It looks as if he has the perfect range of experience to apply to this really important job.\u201d Sandy Nairne, the former director of the National Portrait Gallery, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know Tristram closely but I have known his work in and around the cultural sector and he has been a very strong voice. You think, for example, of his voice in arts and education, his voice in the Wedgwood campaign. \u201cI have always felt that we should think very openly about the range of talented people who could lead our institutions. It doesn\u2019t do us well to have narrow precepts about who should be doing these things. Leadership can come from many different places so this is a really interesting appointment.\u201d One of the first questions for Hunt to answer is on his view of the future of free entry to the V&amp;A. In a 2010 piece for the Guardian, he complained that despite charges for entry to the Potteries Museum in Stoke, \u201cthe teeming London museums continue to enjoy a state subsidy to retain free admission\u201d and said that it was time \u201cto think about reintroducing charges for our national museums\u201d. The V&amp;A says that despite that piece he is \u201cfully committed to free museum entrance\u201d. In his resignation letter to Corbyn, Hunt said life as an MP had been \u201cboth deeply rewarding and intensely frustrating\u201d and referred to his dissatisfaction with the Labour party\u2019s response to \u201cthe social, cultural and economic forces which have rocked mainstream social democratic and socialist parties\u201d across the world. \u201cI am sorry to put the party and the people of Stoke-on-Trent through a byelection,\u201d he added. \u201cI have no desire to rock the boat now and anyone who interprets my decision to leave in that way is just plain wrong.\u201d He said he would be impartial in his new position. In a statement released by the V&amp;A, Hunt said he was \u201cdelighted and honoured\u201d by the appointment. \u201cI have loved the V&amp;A since I was a boy, and today it is a global leader in its unrivalled collections, special exhibitions, academic research and visitor experience.\u201d The V&amp;A chairman, Nicholas Coleridge, said Hunt had \u201ca highly compelling mixture of experience across public life, the arts, history, education and academia, and knows our collections well from his writing and broadcasting.\u201d He added: \u201cHe is an informed and articulate leader and communicator on numerous facets of culture, both historic and contemporary, and I greatly look forward to working with him at the V&amp;A.\u201d Bradley congratulated Hunt and said: \u201cI look forward to working alongside him.\u201d The V&amp;A moved quickly to look for a new director after Roth announced his resignation in September, a decision hastened by his disillusionment over the British vote to leave the EU. In interviews with the German broadcaster DW, Roth said the Brexit vote felt like a personal defeat and he had been particularly upset to hear aggressive \u201cwar rhetoric\u201d during the referendum campaign. Roth was appointed in 2011, becoming the first foreign director of the V&amp;A since it was founded in 1852."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
