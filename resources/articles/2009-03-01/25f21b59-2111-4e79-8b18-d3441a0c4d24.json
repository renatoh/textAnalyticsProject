How typical of Edwin van der Sar that he should come on to the pitch to offer some words of encouragement to the man who has spent the last year or so trying to displace him from the team. We may never know the exact content of what Van der Sar told his younger colleague, but it is fair to say it was probably more than just a good-luck message. The preparation at United is so meticulous these days that the club employ researchers to compile data on opposition penalty-takers, logging every detail from the direction in which they usually aim to whether they strike the ball with pace or prefer to place it into the net. Van der Sar keeps his own records and, as we saw in Moscow last May, they have not served him too badly. Look closely at the footage of that Champions League final shoot-out and, no kidding, you will even see a flicker of a smile cross his face when Nicolas Anelka takes the first, tentative steps on that long walk from the centre circle. Van der Sar has since spoken of knowing at that precise moment where the ball was going to go and that he was going to return the European Cup to Old Trafford. When you have a goalkeeper of that experience and confidence to get past, it is no surprise Foster has found it so difficult to put together a run of appearances since recovering from his snapped knee ligaments. This was only his seventh game in the last two seasons and on Wednesday, when the Premier League leaders play at Newcastle United, he will almost certainly be back on the bench. It is a strange existence \u2013 training all week, knowing that there is virtually no chance of playing. Yet what he showed here was that Ferguson is not exaggerating when he describes the 25-year-old as \"the man who can be England's goalkeeper for the next 10 years\". David James, after all, will be two months shy of his 40th birthday when the next World Cup comes around and only four other established English goalkeepers \u2013 Chris Kirkland, Robert Green, Paul Robinson and Scott Carson \u2013 played in the Premier League over the weekend, with Matt Duke and Steve Harper yet to build their reputations. When the heat of the battle is dangerously close to intolerable, can Fabio Capello really count upon any of them? Foster's problem is Van der Sar is not due to retire until the summer of 2010 \u2013 but Ferguson has already said it does not automatically mean the Dutchman will be in the first team. Foster, who is expected to sign a new contract before his present deal expires this summer, is recognised inside Old Trafford as the club's best shot-stopper, a reputation that will be further advanced by the way he turned away Jamie O'Hara's effort in the shoot-out. His kicking is also regarded as better than the other members of United's glove triangle \u2013 Van der Sar and Tomasz Kuszczak. What Van der Sar has is experience, authority and presence. Yet Ferguson now knows that Foster also has the mentality for the big occasion. His catching was immaculate, his punching was decisive and, when it came to Tottenham's best chances, it was Foster's quick reflexes that denied Aaron Lennon in the 71st minute and Darren Bent five minutes from the end of extra-time. The tearful O'Hara need not reproach himself too much. He had struck his penalty with pace and power but Foster had read it perfectly, diving to his left, throwing out what goalkeepers call \"a strong hand\". Foster is 6ft 3in and, arms outstretched, bouncing up and down, he must have been an imposing sight for David Bentley as he dragged Tottenham's third spot kick wide and left Anderson to finish the game. There was no delirious charge from United's players and, this being the Carling Cup, Cristiano Ronaldo did not bury his face in the turf. It was more of a gentle trot to congratulate the man who would receive the man-of-the-match award from Sir Bobby Charlton. Foster must hope this was the moment his United career started in earnest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
