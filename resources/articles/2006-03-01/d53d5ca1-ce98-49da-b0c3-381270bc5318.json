Moreover, members of the armed forces individually shared responsibility for complicity in these unlawful actions, the court heard. The claims were made by counsel for Flight Lieutenant Malcolm Kendall-Smith, 37, an RAF doctor facing a court martial for refusing to return to the war-torn country. \"The flight lieutenant's case is that Iraq is and remains under occupation,\" defence counsel Philip Sapsford QC told an open pre-trial hearing at the court martial centre in Aldershot barracks, Hampshire. Flt Lt Kendal-Smith, based at RAF Kinloss in Scotland, is charged with five counts of disobeying lawful commands in 2005 when he was asked to return to Iraq. Though he has served there before, he only later came to the view that the war was illegal, partly after reading the attorney-general's advice which raised doubts about the lawfulness of the invasion. If the March 2003 invasion was unlawful \"the fruits of the poison tree filters down to the order itself\", Mr Sapsford told assistant judge advocate Jack Bayliss. \"If the UK is not entitled in international law to use force against Iraq, the flight lieutenant is entitled to say to this tribunal 'I hold that belief honestly and in these circumstances it's my duty to disobey these orders',\" Mr Sapsford added. It was not enough to say he was just doing his job and obeying orders. \"That argument had gone out of the window in 1946,\" he said refering to the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals. David Perry, counsel for the RAF, said whatever the situation at the time of the invasion in 2003, Flt Lt Kendall-Smith refused to go to Iraq in 2005 when British troops there were covered by UN resolutions with the approval of a democratically-elected Iraqi government. Moreover, as a doctor he was a non-combatant. Mr Perry also rejected the argument that individual service personnel could be implicated in \"crimes of aggression\". He said these were a \"leadership crime\" which the Nuremberg trials established could not be committed by an individual not in a position to dictate state policy. The hearing was adjourned. Next Wednesday Judge Bayliss will rule on whether Flt Lt Kendall-Smith can use the defence that the orders were unlawful. His court martial is due to start on April 6."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
