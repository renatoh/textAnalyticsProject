Themes by Miles Davis, Metheny, Chick Corea and Joe Henderson join originals here, and both Corea and Metheny turn up as guests in a group that also includes saxophonists Chris Potter and the (unrelated) Puerto Rican David Sanchez. Like Jack DeJohnette, Antonio Sanchez is a percussionist who was a pianist first; also like DeJohnette, he has a profound awareness of the ensemble's changing shape, and can deliver intricate detail without clutter. Explosive bursts and rolls dazzlingly interact with Corea's staccato comping on One for Antonio, and Did You Get It (like a fast cool-school piece with a storming sax counterpoint at the start and a wailing two-horn conversation at the end) has a flickering cymbal beat you want to cheer. The light-speed thinking of Potter and the soulfulness of David Sanchez make a strong contrast, and Davis's classic Solar is a mercurial guitar/drums dialogue.
