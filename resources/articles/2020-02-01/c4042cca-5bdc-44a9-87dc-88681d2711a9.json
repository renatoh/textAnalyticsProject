Representing the serial trophy winners was a dream scenario until recently but, as two of their senior players have confirmed, the past three months have not been easy. The British &amp; Irish Lions hooker Jamie George has described the week before last month\u2019s European pool game against Racing 92 as \u201cprobably the worst week of some people\u2019s lives\u201d while Maro Itoje says it came as a shock when he was informed that financial arrangements between himself and the club had fallen foul of the regulations. Both say they intend to stay at Saracens next season but do not yet know to what extent relegation to the Championship will affect their careers. As things stand both George and Itoje, currently on England duty, are committed to remaining but are unsure how many of their teammates will be able to do likewise. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got all the answers yet,\u201d George said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult one. We are 80 or 90% of the way to knowing what\u2019s going on but there\u2019s still a few bits to work out. I won\u2019t lie to you, there is a lot going on. We are obviously feeling for the boys at the club who are having to deal with it day in, day out. Coming away into [England\u2019s] camp was almost a relief \u2026 we\u2019ve something else to focus on.\u201d Itoje also revealed it \u201cfelt like an invasion of privacy\u201d when the full independent report detailing his image rights arrangements with the club was leaked, making public a significant amount of joint investment detail. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t ideal, to be honest. It felt like an invasion of privacy but some things are out of your control. \u201cWhen I entered into [the agreements] they were all \u2013 to my knowledge, based on anything I got told \u2013 above board. There wasn\u2019t even the slightest thought of it being not allowed by the salary cap manager. Obviously the situation is very different now. It is very clear that whatever you do, you have to get it checked.\u201d Itoje, though, is not so keen for players\u2019 salaries to become a routine matter of public record in future \u2013 \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want anybody or everybody knowing exactly what I\u2019m earning \u2026 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a genuine need for that\u201d \u2013 and would clearly prefer the furore to go away. \u201cNo one at the club wanted this to happen and no one at the club envisaged this would happen. So I don\u2019t want to sit here and say: \u2018It was this person\u2019s fault or that person\u2019s fault.\u2019 I\u2019m not here to point fingers.\u201d George was more forthcoming on the emotions he has experienced since Saracens\u2019 original fine and points deduction were announced in early November. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to put one word on it. [At first] you\u2019re angry or upset but find a way to find the positives. Then something else happens and you go through it again. We\u2019ll be challenged this season more than we\u2019ve ever been and probably again next season. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we fight to keep the club afloat really. \u201cI guess we as players feel a responsibility to pay back what the club have given us. They have shown a huge amount of loyalty to me, as well as remorse in terms of what they have done. That is appreciated. I don\u2019t feel let down. The opportunities that Nigel Wray has given to me as a person from the age of 17 \u2026 he has invested so much time and love in me so I will be for ever grateful for that.\u201d Quite how easy the club\u2019s senior players will find it to juggle Championship rugby with retaining their England starting places under Eddie Jones while also pushing their Lions claims remains to be seen. George, now 29, is trying to look on the bright side \u2013 \u201cIt might be an opportunity to rest a little bit more which you don\u2019t really get at this stage of your career\u201d \u2013 but not everyone\u2019s circumstances are the same. \u201cThe conversations are ongoing with Eddie and [Saracens\u2019 director of rugby] Mark McCall,\u201d George said. \u201cI think it will be different for each individual but I want to stay at the club and be part of the transition going forward. I didn\u2019t get any offers from France; maybe they aren\u2019t interested. But I haven\u2019t been looking. \u201cFor me the pinnacle of my career is playing for England and further, so for that to be the case I need to be in the country. There is talk of playing pretty competitive games in South Africa and talk of actually playing against South Africa. Games like that will be essential.\u201d England, meanwhile, are still hopeful that Manu Tuilagi may be fit to feature against Ireland on Sunday week having been injured in the first half against France and sat out the Scotland game with a sore groin. Henry Slade is also making progress following ankle trouble but Anthony Watson\u2019s calf injury is set to sideline him for at least another couple of weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
