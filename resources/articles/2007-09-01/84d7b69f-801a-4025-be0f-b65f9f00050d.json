Yet, even in such a comfortable victory, there were aspects that will have particularly pleased Steve McClaren, not least the efficiency and understanding shown in central midfield by Gareth Barry and Steven Gerrard. They may not have played alongside each other before, but they completely exposed the myth that an ideal midfield pairing in a 4-4-2 side is a holding player with an attacking team-mate. These were two players in harmony. When one broke forward to follow his pass and support the attack, the other observed, retreated and covered, holding the space behind and always wary of the interception. Simple, but effective. Barry has never been the quickest. Graham Taylor, once his manager at Aston Villa, always suggested that his lack of acceleration would preclude him from an international career. But his assets more than cover his shortcomings. He has an engine, can head and tackle, and he passes economically. More importantly, he plays unselfishly. In the past few years, he has moved from the left of three centre-halves to wide left to central midfield with consistency and no complaint. Already, he has accrued a fantastic appearance record in the Premier League for one so young. I pleaded with Tottenham to take him not long before my departure from the club. Indeed, his agent was disappointed when talks were broken off. Gerrard must have relished playing alongside his left-footed partner. The Liverpool powerhouse started deeper but, as the game progressed, we saw a clear dovetailing of duties. There was a rhythm about their moves, one forward, the other one holding and vice-versa. Israel's holding protector, Arik Benado, was never happy as either of his opponents advanced. Russia may produce an attacking threat, but England will gain confidence from their relatively smooth passing game. There were other pluses. McClaren's side benefited from not having square pegs in round holes. They used the width well. Shaun Wright-Phillips and Micah Richards on the right made inroads with their pace and movement. On the other flank, with Joe Cole narrow, namesake Ashley took up his team-mate's space well. Joe Cole can often delay attacks by taking a touch too many, but his dribbling also draws free-kicks. Michael Owen could take heart from his goal, which effectively killed off the game while, at the back, John Terry and Rio Ferdinand enjoyed a comfortable afternoon, the former's main action being to head Dudu Aouate's brainless goal-kicks. The jury can stay out on Paul Robinson as this was no trial. Greater tests lie ahead. These positives must be taken forward and exploited again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
