Ray Martin-Wells said the two pro-Brexit parties would \u201ctake each other out\u201d and relinquish a once in a generation chance to remove Labour MPs in their north-east heartland. The former councillor said he was \u201csurprised and disappointed that [Farage] will effectively hand seats to Labour who clearly don\u2019t want to support Brexit\u201d. He added: \u201cI think if we had a clear run at it we\u2019d have a strong chance \u2013 Boris is a straight-talker which goes down very well in Hartlepool \u2013 but if the Brexit party stand we will just take each other out.\u201d Labour is facing its greatest challenge in decades to retain seats like Hartlepool amid rising anger about Brexit and an ascendant Brexit party, which took over the borough council in September and has been canvassing voters since summer. Hartlepool voted 69.3% for leave in the referendum \u2013 the highest in the region \u2013 and there is little sign that opinion has softened. Many believe that Hartlepool is Farage\u2019s best chance of winning a seat at Westminster and, according to estimates by the academic Chris Hanretty, the town returned a higher Brexit party vote than any Labour seat in May\u2019s European parliamentary elections. Shane Moore, the town\u2019s Brexit party leader, believes his party will end Labour\u2019s 56-year stranglehold on Hartlepool in December, whether the Conservative party field a candidate or not. \u201cThe sentiment we have from the general public and the fact Labour have finally got off the fence and said we\u2019re campaigning for a second referendum \u2013 that\u2019s just helped us in Hartlepool,\u201d he said. The 11-month-old Brexit party took charge of its first full council meeting anywhere in the country on Thursday night, having taken joint-control of Hartlepool council with the Conservatives in September following the defection of a number of ex-Ukip and independent councillors. Labour lost control of the council in May, along with neighbouring Darlington, Middlesbrough, Stockton and Redcar and Cleveland councils as it was punished at the polls for its prevarication on Brexit. In Hartlepool, the club\u2019s former football chairman, Ken Hodcroft, has been announced as the Brexit party candidate and activists have been hitting the doorsteps since August. The Tories, meanwhile, are yet to get out of the blocks. The party locally has chosen its favoured candidate \u2013 understood to be Ralph Ward-Jackson, a friend of David Cameron and descendant of the 19th-century founder of West Hartlepool \u2013 but his candidacy has not yet been approved by Conservative party central office. On Hartlepool\u2019s poorest estate, Dyke House, people are queuing up to kick the establishment, said Sacha Bedding, the manager of a pioneering community centre in the neighbourhood. \u201cThere\u2019s a level of anger in this community about not leaving the EU and the duplicitous nature of the politicians stopping that happening. It\u2019s tangible,\u201d he said, adding that Brexit party activists were getting a \u201cgreat response on the doors\u201d. About 2,000 people a year use Bedding\u2019s centre, the Annexe, either for emergency food parcels or for help finding a job. The town\u2019s challenges are stark: as many as 8,000 children in Hartlepool \u2013 38% of that age group \u2013 are living in poverty after housing costs; the number of unemployment benefits is double the national average; weekly pay is \u00a360 less than the UK average; life expectancy is actually falling in the town. Locally and nationally, Labour\u2019s strategy is to highlight these issues and steer the focus from Brexit. \u201cThe message we\u2019re taking to the public is you have a choice: who do you trust with your public services? This election is about a lot more than just Brexit,\u201d said Jonathan Brash, a local Labour party activist. Labour has been beset by infighting locally, with its long-serving leader Christopher Akers-Belcher quitting the party after what he described as \u201cracism, bullying, harassment and anti-semitism\u201d in the party (Brash said Labour \u201ccould not be stronger\u201d following Akers-Belcher\u2019s departure). \u201cI think the Labour party will just be annihilated,\u201d said Akers-Belcher, who ran the council for six years until May. He has since joined the Socialist Labour party group and will be campaigning for its candidate in the election. \u201cThey are absolutely snookered. It will go to the Brexit party. What Labour are going for is just another referendum and I honestly think if there was another vote in Hartlepool the leave vote would be even higher. People just want a clean break.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
