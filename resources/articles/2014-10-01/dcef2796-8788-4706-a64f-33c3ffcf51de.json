Chelsea appeared set to stretch their advantage over the champions to eight points before the Dutchman\u2019s late intervention at Old Trafford on Sunday. \u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d said Pellegrini initially when asked if he laughed at the strike. \u201cAt that moment, I thought the game was finished and I went to drink a glass of water.\u201d Yet pushed, he admitted: \u201cWhen they told me after how the game finished I smiled.\u201d Last Tuesday City allowed a two-goal lead at CSKA Moscow to slip as they drew 2-2 in a vital Champions League game, before going down 2-1 at West Ham United on Saturday. In each match City\u2019s defence was vulnerable, as it has been on other occasions this term. Pellegrini has been doing extra work on the rearguard. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to have clean sheets,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a team you play easily or you play with more trust when you don\u2019t concede any easy goal at the beginning. Then you start playing against the result, against the time, against the other team. A lot of things. \u201cBut I think we must improve in general, not just the talking about the defending. We must create more chances, we must score more goals. We are working on that and I am absolutely sure we will return to be the same team we were in the most important part of last season. But the only way is to compare last season with this season. And I don\u2019t think we are any worse this season.\u201d Vincent Kompany has had to adjust at times to Eliaquim Mangala being his partner in central defence instead of Mart\u00edn Demichelis. Yet Pellegrini denied this was a factor in the unsure defence. \u201cThe same happened with Demichelis last year \u2013 remember all the criticism for him after he just arrived in the Premier League,\u201d he said. \u201cVincent was playing sometime with Mart\u00edn, sometimes with Joleon Lescott, sometimes with Matija Nastasic. \u201cI think Eliaquim Mangala is a young player, he has a lot of experience. And I am sure we bought the centre-back that we need in him. This year with him, with Vincent, Martin, Nastasic and Dedryck Boyata we have a centre-backs that I can assure you will play very well.\u201d Wayne Rooney\u2019s fitness is in the balance for Sunday\u2019s 168th Mancunian derby at the Etihad Stadium, though Pellegrini denied City would make any particular plans for United\u2019s captain should he play. \u201cNo. We really don\u2019t change our way to play for some player, or other player. If it\u2019s not Wayne Rooney it will be \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda, Juan Mata or Robin van Persie,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have so many creative players that they have a lot of different chances [to score]. We cannot prepare for a game talking about one player. Because after it can happen that he doesn\u2019t play and we have to change all of what we do. We really try to have a style of play every game. I am sure Wayne Rooney is one of the important players of Manchester United but I repeat, also other players are very difficult for us.\u201d After Newcastle United\u2019s visit on Wednesday evening in the Capital One Cup, and United at the weekend, CSKA arrive for the return Champions League match. Pellegrini admits these are three vital matches in a week. \u201cI think we must win the three games,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are three competitions. If we win tomorrow we will continue in the Capital One Cup. If we win the derby on Sunday we are trying to go for first place in the table. And if we win next Wednesday we are going to take a huge step to qualifying in the Champions League. So they are three games that are very important and I am sure the squad is prepared to do it.\u201d Samir Nasri returns to City\u2019s squad after recovering ahead of schedule from a groin injury. Newcastle are likely to be without Papiss Ciss\u00e9 but Ryan Taylor could make his first appearance since August 2012 after two cruciate injuries. Sami Hyypia comes up against familiar foes on Wednesday when he takes his Brighton side to Tottenham. Hyypia regularly faced Spurs during his successful 10 years as a centre-half with Liverpool. The Finn is finding management in England rather tougher, with Brighton one place above the relegation zone after 10 Championship matches without a win. However, Hyypia has urged his struggling side to play with no fear at White Hart Lane. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we concentrate on how we play there and how we present ourselves,\u201d he told the Argus. \u201cWe need to have the courage; we don\u2019t have to fear them. They have good individuals and they can really hurt you if they are on top of their game but we don\u2019t have to fear them.\u201d The winger Kazenga LuaLua is back in the squad after a one-match ban but Sam Baldock is cup-tied. Another striker, Craig Mackail-Smith, could miss out with a hamstring injury and the right-back Bruno is struggling with groin trouble. Stoke have changed their tactics for defending set-pieces over concerns that Ryan Shawcross is being singled out by referees. The Stoke captain gave away a penalty in the 2-1 win over Swansea this month for grappling with Wilfried Bony and was deployed at Southampton last weekend as a zonal defender. The assistant manager, Mark Bowen said: \u201cIn Saturday\u2019s game we tried to pull him out of the spotlight. Instead of him actually marking from a corner, we put him in an area where he could just go and attack the ball, which is not his game \u2013 he\u2019s not been brought up on that. \u201cIt comes to something when you\u2019ve got to try to change your system of marking around because you\u2019re worried that the lad is getting targeted.\u201d Stoke fear they may be without Robert Huth for several weeks because of a calf injury. Southampton\u2019s manager, Ronald Koeman, is expecting another tough game after the 1-0 win over these opponents on Saturday. He may rest some key players but insists he will not make wholesale changes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
