The Turner prize-winning artist\u2019s doorway is only chest high, like the entrance to a Wendy house. I tell her I feel I\u2019ve been forced to bow down and pay homage. A more usual reaction, she says, is that people feel as if they\u2019ve been eaten. Once in, you\u2019re greeted by a monumental set of fibreglass breasts \u2013 pink, perky and disembodied \u2013 which occupy the centre of the floor. There are more breasts on a side table: spare components from the artist\u2019s squirting fountain sculptures. These breasts are adapted from maritime floats. Buoy boobs: I imagine Prouvost, with her love of polyglot wordplay, would appreciate the pun. Prouvost is not shy in matters of the body. Early proposals for her poster project for Art on the Underground \u2013 which rolls out across the network on Thursday \u2013 included drawings of welcoming breasts and sets of wobbly buttocks rubbing against one another. Prouvost \u2013 who was born in Lille, France, but lived in the UK for 18 years \u2013 hoped they might lure Britain back to the bosom of Europe. \u201cWhen they invited me, I actually wanted to take a stand and talk as a foreigner in London,\u201d she says. \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine we\u2019re not together. Europe is still so young, and it\u2019s not so long ago that there were terrible wars. It\u2019s a shame to not try to make it work.\u201d The project launches with a choral performance at Stratford station during the rush hour. Should you attend, Prouvost would be grateful if you\u2019d bring a shovel. After the singing, the artist has suggested we nip around the corner and start digging a new tunnel over to the continent \u2013 \u201cto reconnect again, and make sure Britain and Europe stay as one\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s the Eurostar, but maybe we need to find a little path that is a bit less controlled by the state, where we can go with our torch.\u201d Prouvost suggests that the notorious Mole Man of Hackney might help us out: William Lyttle excavated a warren of tunnels beneath his home. She is drawn to dogged, off-grid creative endeavours. At the current Venice Biennale, where she occupies the French pavilion, she presents a film in which a group of talented misfits travel from Paris to Venice by way of the Palais Id\u00e9al du Facteur Cheval \u2013 a fantastical stone palace constructed over 30 years from pebbles by a postman in the north of France. Tunnelling is a Prouvost trademark. Wantee, a work for which she won the 2013 Turner prize, explores the home, teapots and tunnelling habits of her (fictional) grandparents. In the film, her \u201cGrandad\u201d \u2013 loosely inspired by German-born artist Kurt Schwitters \u2013 mysteriously disappears down a tunnel he has been digging to Africa. Back in Venice, Prouvost has started burrowing through the cellar of her French pavilion in a playful attempt to connect to the British one next door. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll meet one day,\u201d she tells me. To say Prouvost has an immaculate poker face is an understatement: she approaches interviews as a very sincere form of performance art in which it is not made evident whether your conversation is taking place in reality or her more colourful fantasy world. Discussing her interest in breasts, bottoms and inviting flesh, she describes how the extreme physicality of breastfeeding \u2013 \u201cwhen you\u2019ve got a little animal sucking you away\u201d \u2013 had grounded her in the experience of being a creature. Then without missing a beat, she segues into a discussion of Grandad and his minimal art, and how Grandma \u201cmade a teapot for him with bums and boobs.\u201d And we\u2019re back out in the constructed world of Wantee again. Like the best storytellers, Prouvost roots her fantasy world in lived experience. Her \u201cGrandad\u201d may be part Schwitters but he\u2019s also part John Latham, the late London-based artist for whom she worked as an assistant. Like Latham, Grandad has lived through wartime and poverty, is a conceptual artist and a philosopher, and reuses his teabags. (In a cheeky, affectionate coda to a larger work made in tribute to Latham at the Serpentine in 2017, Prouvost placed used teabags out on radiators around the slick gallery.) The irreverent gesture raised eyebrows, but was immediately evocative. We all know a teabag reuser \u2013 many of us indulge in such habits ourselves. \u201cI mean, why not?\u201d says Prouvost. \u201cI reused when we were there and I assisted him. It tastes a bit of cardboard after a while, but when you live in the war I think everything\u2019s different. He was aware of how much we consume, how we have no sense of anything. For me it has a much deeper meaning and of course a bit of humour for a time, but humour passed.\u201d Prouvost\u2019s fleshier designs did not make the final cut for Art on the Underground. Instead, accompanied by her fictional Grandma, she has papered stations with hand-painted statements inviting commuters to pause for thought: \u201cYou are deeper than what you think\u201d, \u201cOh stay with us the party has just begun\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019re going the wrong direction\u201d and \u201cIdeally these words would pause everything now\u201d. While she produces work in many physical forms \u2013 ceramics, paintings, blown glass and tapestries \u2013 language is Prouvost\u2019s first material. In her videos she speaks in whispery, confessional tones. Earlier sculptural work features inanimate objects mounted on little plinths \u2013 a pat of butter, a cigarette \u2013 talking with Prouvost\u2019s voice as the spotlight hits them. \u201cYou would turn me on if you put me in your mouth, you know\u201d whispers the e-cigarette. A long-running series of signs, painted in white on black panels, offer ambiguous and intimate statements about the space in which they\u2019re hanging and the reader\u2019s relationship to it: \u201cThis sign exists to make you see the wall better\u201d, \u201cIdealy this sign be spelt wright\u201d, \u201cThis sign wishes to have been read just by you\u201d. A delightful recent book on her work takes the form of a glossary \u2013 or \u201cLegsicon\u201d as it is dubbed in Prouvost speak. Under \u201clanguage\u201d she writes: \u201cHelps communication between humans but also misunderstanding.\u201d Well, quite. Prouvost moved to London aged 18 to study art at Central St Martin\u2019s. Having moved to Flemish-speaking Antwerp five years ago, she finds herself once again between languages and national identities. \u201cI feel a bit foreign everywhere. Yes, France as well,\u201d she admits. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of nice. Of course sometimes you want to engage and have a connection with someone. It [affects] language as well. I think in France, when someone tells me to \u2018fuck off\u2019 in French, you really feel it, but when you\u2019re a foreigner, you\u2019re just: \u2018Well, whatever.\u2019 You take in things with less weight. You\u2019re floating a bit.\u201d As a non-native speaker, she says, \u201cyou have a distance to the word\u201d. Prouvost sees a parallel between her status as \u201can outsider who is part of it\u201d and the act of travelling on the tube, deep below ground: not in the city, but somehow of the city. Sitting on the Jubilee line, we\u2019re ideally placed to make a break for it, extending our subterranean journey under the Channel, over to the continent. I wouldn\u2019t put it past Prouvost to really start digging a tunnel to Europe. Beneath the sweet, playful demeanour she has a solid anti-authoritarian streak and is a determined excavator. \u201cI\u2019ll show you the way,\u201d she tells me, solemnly. \u201cI hope you\u2019re coming to help me.\u201d Art on the Underground will be displayed at 270 sites across the network, from 20 June to 15 December"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
