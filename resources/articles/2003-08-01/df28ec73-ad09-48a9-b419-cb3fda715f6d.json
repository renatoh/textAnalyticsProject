Research by Woolwich, the mortgage lending arm of Barclays Bank, is expected to show tomorrow that optimism about the outlook for prices faltered during July after rising in each of the three previous months. A survey of estate agents by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, due out on Tuesday, is expected to show that prices in large tracts of the country are stagnating. Woolwich's index tracks beliefs about the outlook for house prices and is believed to have recorded a slight drop during July. Confidence earlier in the year was boosted by the end of the war in Iraq. The Rics survey, which is based on reports from estate agents on market activity in their areas, is expected to show that prices in the South of England, in particular, are simply marking time. Buyers returned to the market after the end of the Iraq war, but have been slow to make offers and complete deals. In the North, prices are still rising, and the market is active. But the slowdown that has affected the London market is expected to spread to the rest of the country before long. This week's Rics report will back up a succession of other recent reports pointing to a sustained, market-wide slowdown in house prices. The Bank of England forecast last week that house price inflation would be zero within two years. An average of zero would mean that prices in some areas had fallen. Most observers believe the market will slow down gradually, but admit that sudden rises in interest rates or unemployment could tip it into a crash. The cost of fixed-rate mortgages is now rising. Labour market statistics published by the Government last month showed an increase in employment levels, but beneath the headline figures there were trends that could influence the property market. There was a slight fall in the number of 25 to 34-year-olds in employment and this may have had an impact on the purchasing power of first-time buyers. Simon Rubinsohn, at stockbroker Gerrard, noted that the number of people categorised as self-employed was at its highest level since 1991, while the employees in full-time work had dropped by 119,000 since the end of 2002. He said: 'It would strike me that if you are seeing a pick-up in self-employment and a decline in full-time employment, you must come to the conclusion that there's a bit more vulnerability in house prices.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
