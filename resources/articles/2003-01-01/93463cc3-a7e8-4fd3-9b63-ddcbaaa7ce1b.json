Strictly speaking, Juan is my thalassotherapist, but he was so horrified at the tension knots in my back and legs that he's throwing in a massage. 'You must throw your computer out the window,' he insisted. That's easy for him to say. Juan spends his days applying moisturising oil to well-off, middle-aged women under swaying palms. I'm unlikely to throw away my computer, but at least I'm in the right place to do something about its side effects. Mention Mallorca to anyone and they think package holidays and ham and eggs, so it takes a lot of effort to convince people that you're actually going on a posh spa holiday in a lovely resort. But Juan, with his beatific smile and relaxed ways, is living proof that the island has grown up into a pretty, laid-back Spanish destination. If you're still uneasy about saying the 'M' word, try announcing you're going to Palma instead. Whatever you call it, the place offers near-guaranteed sunshine and is only a budget flight away. Budget the Mardavall Hotel and Spa is not, but the treatments and service live up to expectations. This fussy asthmatic needed the luxurious duck-down quilt taken off her bed and replaced with boring blankets, and it was done speedily and obligingly. The list of treatments is exhaustive, but the speciality is thalassotherapy, which involves immersing yourself in a fearsome-looking bath filled with sea mineral-laced water, with jets blasting your 'problem areas'. Luxurious La Prairie facials are another reason to indulge. Even if treatments aren't your thing, the rest of the spa is incredibly relaxing. It's recommended that you lie down after some of the treatments, but that doesn't mean doing anything as prosaic as going back to your room. There's an al fresco room for waterbeds, with a stream complete with floating fresh flowers running through the middle. The beds are set in a stone base and covered with peach-coloured towels; it looks like a lunar landscape for beauty queens, and sinking down onto them is equally out of this world. Had I not budged from my gently undulating spot in the sun, I would have been the happiest girl in the world. But budge I did, to the heated outdoor pool, the cold outdoor pool, the heated indoor pool and the 35C indoor salt pool, and that was when the real nature of the Mardavall revealed itself. Splashing about in the outdoor pool, I was musing on what sort of person such a place might attract - I hadn't seen anyone other than your run-of-the-mill monied German - when a naked Japanese man lowered himself into the pool. Positive I was seeing things, I took off my goggles, and sure enough, there he was, buttocks bobbing up and down like swimming aids. More surprising still, however, was the poolside presence of his bodyguards. As modestly attired as their boss was naked, two burly men sat uncomfortably perched on sun-loungers. I decided it was time to go to dress for dinner, but my swimming companion chose this moment to heave himself out of the pool so I stayed put for a minute. One of his heavies handed him his robe and, rather incongruously, his briefcase, so I darted out of the pool to quiz the other. I had never seen a real life bodyguard before. It turned out that the heavies were from Russia but, being a good bodyguard, he wouldn't tell me who the underdressed Japanese guy was. I needed to go and lie down on the waterbeds again to recover and left exploring the rest of the spa until the following day. There was no sign of the mystery swimmer at breakfast, although it's possible I wouldn't have recognised him with his clothes on. I skipped the macrobiotic option available for the seriously health-conscious, and feasted on several kinds of muesli, a medley of fresh fruit, porridge, croissants, cakes and breads and a cooked breakfast in the hotel's informal dining room which also serves lunch and dinner. If you don't want to venture into town for dinner, the hotel also has an excellent formal dining room.Although it verges on nouvelle cuisine, its trademarks are fresh local ingredi ents. With all of this luxury and loveliness, it's a shame the interior design talents don't extend to the rooms, which were described to me by a fellow guest as 'straight from Ikea'. The pointy metallic lamps and fixtures and early 90s Nineties wood panelling were a great shame because the rooms have the potential to be fantastic. They are huge, with every need catered for; curtains open and close at the touch of a button, a Bang &amp; Olufsen television which swivels around when you turn it on, and the balcony is the size of many London flats. The Mardavall prides itself on covering the walls with work by local artists; this is admirable, but someone needs to steer the curating policy. The picture in my room was so hideous I hung a towel over it. Imagine The Scream rendered in yellow, grey and black by a seven-year-old with attention deficit disorder, who takes zombie movies as his inspiration. Not good-looking, nor relaxing. As I lay there and closed my eyes, however, stretching out legs softened by Juan's ministrations and gently aching from my labours, I was able to forget all about it. \u00b7 Three nights at the Mardavall costs from \u00a3977 per person, and seven nights costs from \u00a31658. These prices include return economy flights with British Midland from Heathrow to Palma, transfers, a stay at a grand deluxe twin room, breakfast and taxes. Also thrown in is a spa package, Relax Anti-Stress or Simplicity Beauty (three hours of treatments daily).

Still, here he is, manhandling a trolley along with the rest of us at Larnaca airport and confirming all my worst fears about Cyprus. The kind of place thatDavro goes on holiday. And it gets worse - the PR whispers that he is almost certainly staying in the same hotel as us. It will turn out that most of the other guests at the five-star Elysium Mediterranean Beach Resort are British. This is a feature of our 'special relationship' with Cyprus, apparently. One reason I have never been drawn before is all those British Army bases. Cyprus is, according to the Rough Guide, one of the most militarised territories on earth, though my knowledge of it was dominated by having read a couple of news stories about Ayia Napa, one of the island's big package resorts with a dubious reputation for nightlife and violence. However, several hours of white-knuckle taxi ride later, we arrive in Paphos on the South-West coast, and it quickly becomes apparent that this is a different slice of Cyprus. District capital and, in Roman times, capital of the island, Paphos boasts impressive historical sites, and is surrounded by picturesque countryside. Let's not get carried away though - nobody could accuse Paphos of being pretty. The view attests to an unholy alliance between commercial development and ancient sites. Hotels are being built everywhere, but their guests are never more than a minute from a monument. The Elysium, for example, is slap bang next to the Hellenistic Tombs of the Kings and walking distance from the Roman mosaics. It all makes for an odd, chaotic and jarring sort of landscape. The Elysium opened in June last year and development is ongoing (they have plans to build a sandy beach for guests). It is palatial and clean; everywhere you go, staff are scrubbing away at paving stones. It is a large and perfectly maintained village-like complex which - apart from the Las Vegas-style 'imposing' drawbridge entrance - has a mostly tasteful and restful feel. Colours are warm, comforting terracottas and ochres. There are mosaics, colonnades, waterfalls and a beautiful sunken pool. As well as standard guest rooms, there are more privately situated loft-style apartments, some of which have mini-pools. And there is an Aveda concept spa. If these things matter to you, you will already know that all things Aveda are gorgeous. Because I don't usually stay in places like this, I introduce myself to a Daily Mail -reading, middle-aged couple who seem fairly typical. They have been coming to Paphos for five years, drawn by good winter weather (the climate being five degrees cooler in summer and five degrees warmer in winter than the rest of the island). They usually stay at the Four Seasons, but they thought they'd give the Elysium a go. They don't think it's yet up to the standards of the Four Seasons (because there's no beach), but they think the service is good and will come again. So you've got the picture - winter sun in a swanky if anonymous setting. By the way, no sign of Bobby Davro but, promisingly, they were expecting Pierce Brosnan. \u00b7 Ursula Kenny travelled with Cyprair Holidays (0870 230 2300, www.cyprair-holidays.com). Between January and March 2003, seven nights at the Elysium (www.elysium-hotel.com) costs \u00a3437 a head, based on two sharing on a bed and breakfast basis and including return flights and transfers. The price this summer will be \u00a3531."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
