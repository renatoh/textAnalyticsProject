I did - the first serious session I had since injuring my knee last March while training for the Paris marathon, and the first proper run since I moved to Sydney two months ago. I think most readers will agree with me when I say that the first couple of runs after an injury and long absence from the sport are the absolute worst: out of breath after 15 minutes, calves screaming for mercy, stitches eating away at your sides, and self doubt creeping through your mind (\"I will never, ever be able to run again!\"). Of course, this wasn't helped by the sheer number of extremely fit athletes populating the city. I could sit and watch them jog back and forth around Sydney's seawall for hours \u2013 they're that impressive. Yesterday they passed me by the dozen, muscled and tanned (some falling in the \"beefcake\" category) while I plodded along, conveniently stopping every five minutes to instagram sunset pictures and catch a break. I ended my 40 minutes run by collapsing in the grass. But no matter, I'm back in the game. And that's what counts, right? Had I been fit enough, I would have loved to participate in the Glow Worm trail running weekend here in New South Wales - participants had the choice between a half and full marathon on pristine trails in one of Australia's most beautiful national parks. So how did everyone else get on? Did anyone share my experience, and pledge to run again after an injury? Did you get the PB you were chasing this season? Or did you start a couch-to-5k program? As ever, let us know your weekend tales in the comments below."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
