On a track called The 1975, a version of which traditionally opens each of the British band\u2019s albums, the 16-year-old environmental activist restates her position on the need to act on the climate emergency. Thunberg said: \u201cI\u2019m grateful to get the opportunity to get my message out to a broad new audience in a new way. I think it\u2019s great that the 1975 is so strongly engaged in the climate crisis. We quickly need to get people in all branches of society to get involved. And this collaboration I think is something new.\u201d Over the 1975\u2019s minimal orchestral backing, Thunberg says: \u201cWe have to acknowledge that the older generations have failed. All political movements in their present form have failed. But homo sapiens have not yet failed. Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around.\u201d She continues: \u201cWe are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly.\u201d Thunberg concludes: \u201cSo, everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience. It is time to rebel.\u201d Read the full text of her speech below. The proceeds from the track will go to Extinction Rebellion at Thunberg\u2019s request. The environmental group released a statement welcoming the collaboration: \u201cMusic has the power to break through barriers, and right now we really need to break through some barriers if we are to face this emergency.\u201d Thunberg is the first outside party to feature on a recording by the band. The track was recorded in Stockholm in late June and is the first song to be released from the 1975\u2019s forthcoming album, Notes on a Conditional Form. The band manager and founder of the label Dirty Hit, Jamie Oborne, said the group and the label were making efforts to minimise their environmental impact. Dirty Hit\u2019s office has phased out all single-use plastic, will no longer produce plastic products including CD jewel cases and is working to minimise the impact of vinyl production. \u201cRather than ignoring that it\u2019s a pollutant, we\u2019re minimising it by only doing lightweight vinyl from now on,\u201d Oborne said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t very trendy, but one heavyweight LP is the equivalent of making two or three [standard thickness LPs].\u201d Dirty Hit\u2019s CDs and vinyl are contained in paper packaging and not wrapped in non-degradable shrink wrap. Oborne said they had sourced a biodegradable shrink wrap which they would integrate fully once their production plants had full access to it. The 1975\u2019s next merchandise line will also be environmentally friendly, repurposing unsold merchandise into new garments. Oborne dismissed peers\u2019 suggestions that the organisation could be labelled hypocritical for taking a stance on the climate crisis before becoming 100% carbon efficient. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re in this situation where everyone\u2019s standing around and it takes a child to point out that we can make these changes,\u201d he said, referring to Thunberg. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have touring worked out in six weeks because everything\u2019s working against you, but we are going to have it sorted out in a period of time, and 50% is better than nothing. If everyone pushes responsibility onto other people because they can\u2019t completely solve [the issue], we\u2019re already fucked.\u201d The track release follows Thunberg\u2019s address to French politicians on 23 July, in which she urged them to \u201cunite behind the science\u201d of climate change. After rightwing legislators said they would not attend her appearance at the National Assembly, she said youth climate activists have become \u201cthe bad guys\u201d for stating \u201cuncomfortable things\u201d. \u201cJust for quoting or acting on these numbers, these scientific facts, we receive unimaginable amounts of hate and threats,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are being mocked and lied about by members of parliament and journalists.\u201d On 20 September, Thunberg and other young environmental activists will lead a climate strike around the world. The 1975\u2019s new album is the second in their Music for Cars series, which began in November 2018 with A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships. The group will headline this year\u2019s Reading and Leeds festivals in August. The full text of Thunberg\u2019s speech. We are right now in the beginning of a climate and ecological crisis. And we need to call it what it is. An emergency. We must acknowledge that we do not have the situation under control and that we don\u2019t have all the solutions yet. Unless those solutions mean that we simply stop doing certain things. We admit that we are losing this battle. We have to acknowledge that the older generations have failed. All political movements in their present form have failed. But homo sapiens have not yet failed. Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around. We can still fix this. We still have everything in our own hands. But unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems, we most probably don\u2019t stand a chance. We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly. Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that homo sapiens have ever faced. The main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it. We have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gases. And either we do that, or we don\u2019t. You say that nothing in life is black or white. But that is a lie. A very dangerous lie. Either we prevent a 1.5 degree of warming, or we don\u2019t. Either we avoid setting off that irreversible chain reaction beyond human control, or we don\u2019t. Either we choose to go on as a civilisation or we don\u2019t. That is as black or white as it gets. Because there are no grey areas when it comes to survival. Now we all have a choice. We can create transformational action that will safeguard the living conditions for future generations. Or we can continue with our business as usual and fail. That is up to you and me. And yes, we need a system change rather than individual change. But you cannot have one without the other. If you look through history, all the big changes in society have been started by people at the grassroots level. People like you and me. So, I ask you to please wake up and make the changes required possible. To do your best is no longer good enough. We must all do the seemingly impossible. Today, we use about 100 million barrels of oil every single day. There are no politics to change that. There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground. So, we can no longer save the world by playing by the rules. Because the rules have to be changed. Everything needs to change. And it has to start today. So, everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience. It is time to rebel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
