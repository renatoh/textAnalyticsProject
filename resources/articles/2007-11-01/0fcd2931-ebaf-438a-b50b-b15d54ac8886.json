Goldman downgraded Citigroup's shares to a \"sell\" recommendation and warned that there was no \"quick fix\" to the struggling Wall Street firm's problems. The stock slumped 4.9% to $32.33 in early trading, leading the Dow Jones industrial average sharply lower. When it parted company with its chief executive, Charles Prince, two weeks ago, Citigroup put its exposure to the credit-related woes at between $8bn and $11bn. In a research note, Goldman's analyst William Tanona predicted an increase in this figure, saying: \"The lack of leadership at this point in Citigroup's history could not have come at a worse time. With deteriorating consumer and housing metrics, Citigroup is facing mounting pressures across many businesses.\" Since Prince's the departure, the extent of Citigroup's woes has become a benchmark for concern about mortgage-related losses across the American economy, which some predict will trigger a recession. On a temporary basis, the bank is being run by the former US treasury secretary Robert Rubin. Highlighting Citigroup's relatively low ratio of capital to risk-related assets, Goldman predicted that Citigroup may need to raise cash or cut its dividend: \"We do not expect that there will be a 'quick fix' to some of Citi's issues and it will take the new CEO some time before he/she decides on the appropriate course of action.\" Several of Wall Street's top banks have written off billions in trading losses related to the credit crunch, which was sparked by defaults on sub-prime mortgages. Merrill Lynch has lost $7.9bn and Bank of America is widely expected to take a $3bn hit, based on its $11.7bn exposure to troublesome collateralised debt obligations. Barclays last week revealed losses of \u00a31.3bn and Zurich-based insurer Swiss Re joined the list of battered institutions yesterday by writing off SFr1.2bn (\u00a3566m). Paradoxically financial professionals could still take home record bonuses this year. Data compiled by Bloomberg suggested that Wall Street's top five firms could pay out $38bn to staff, up $2bn on last year. Many banks link bonus pools to revenues, which have typically risen from soaring advisory fees on mergers and acquisitions, in spite of falling profits. New York charities say donations are as high as ever and top-end apartments in the Big Apple are still selling quickly. Economist disagree on the extent of the credit woes' impact on consumer spending. But there was a sign of knock-on gloom yesterday from a leading American do-it-yourself retailer, Lowe's, which blamed the weak property market for a 10% fall in quarterly profits to $643m. American retailers face an important test of the strength of spending this week with so-called \"black Friday\", traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year. The day, after Thanksgiving holiday, kicks off the Christmas shopping season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
