We learn that the scandal-prone TV star and former face of the Iceland supermarket chain has sustained two cracked ribs while training for the skating contest. Goddammit, just how much is one woman expected to bear? Still, we've enjoyed seeing her in the promotional photos for the series, posing in a wispy yellow costume, looking for all the world like a flambeed canary. But in truth, I don't know if I can muster the strength for another reality contest \u2013 even if those skating blades add a thrilling whiff of danger to proceedings. That said, I am the woman who actually cried when Danielle Lloyd won Celebrity Total Wipeout this weekend \u2013 I believe I was still feeling emotional after watching One Man and His Dog. \u2724 There have been some notable achievements for young women this week: first, 15-year-old sailor Laura Dekker, from the Netherlands, completed the longest leg of her solo attempt to circumnavigate the globe, travelling 2,200 nautical miles from the Cape Verde Islands to St Maarten. Meanwhile, we learned that 14-year-old April Webster and her 14-year-old boyfriend, Nathan Fishbourne, are Britain's youngest parents. Congratulations one and all! \u2724 Alas, I'm not sure either would qualify for the UKRC Women of Outstanding Achievement Awards \u2013 nominations for which are now open. The UKRC works to advance gender equality in science, engineering and technology \u2013 areas in which women are under-represented in the UK; of nearly 13 million working women, just 5.3% work in science, engineering and technology, compared with a third of the 15.5 million working men. The UKRC awards cover categories from innovation to inspiration and leadership. The closing date is 31 January 2011, and further details can be found at theukrc.org."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
