The opening post is from Macon Phillips, the Director of New Media for the White House. It doesn't look as though Obama will be posting, but Phillips says: Citizen participation will be a priority for the Administration, and the internet will play an important role in that. One significant addition to WhiteHouse.gov reflects a campaign promise from the President: we will publish all non-emergency legislation to the website for five days, and allow the public to review and comment before the President signs it. We'd also like to hear from you -- what sort of things would you find valuable from WhiteHouse.gov? If you have an idea, use this form to let us know. Like the transition website and the campaign's before that, this online community will continue to be a work in progress as we develop new features and content for you. So thanks in advance for your patience and for your feedback. That would, of course, sound a whole lot better if the post allowed comments\u2026. During Obama's campaign, the @BarackObama handle was used to tweet news to followers, but this was abandoned after a \"We just made history\" post dated Nov 5th, 2008. It's not clear if that channel will be used again, but a post on 16 January added: To participate in the Inauguration visit http://pic2009.org or text HISTORY to 56333. Follow the Inauguration on Twitter @obamainaugural Finally, for before &amp; after grabs of the White House web site, see Flickr."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
