Serie A leaders Juventus, who must face Real Madrid across two legs at the end of February and in early March, were below par but held on to stay four points clear at the top of the table. Milan, the reigning Italian champions who must get past Manchester United if they are to make progress towards a sixth Champions League or European Cup success, will wonder how they did not win after creating the best of the chances and suffering from some refereeing decisions that heavily favoured the home side. Andriy Shevchenko, the newly crowned European footballer of the year, struck the post in the first half. A minute from the end the Ukraine striker rounded off a superb run by playing in Andrea Pirlo for a golden opportunity to cut Juve's advantage to a single point. But the midfielder shot just wide of Gianluigi Buffon's left post, with Kaka unmarked in front of goal. Juve managed only one serious attempt on goal, from Gianluca Zambrotta just before the break, and striker Alessandro Del Piero was substituted at half-time. As a result of the draw, Juventus go into the Christmas break with 39 points, Milan have 35. Udinese, who play host to Lazio today, are third on 28. In Spain, Juventus's European opponents, Real Madrid, needed an injury-time goal from Zinedine Zidane to secure a 3-2 victory over Racing Santander and keep alive their slim hopes of challenging runaway leaders Barcelona for the Primera Liga title. Real spent much of the match playing catch-up, with goals from Michael Owen and Ra\u00fal putting them back in the game when Racing twice pulled ahead before Zidane clinched the win. Israel playmaker Yossi Benayoun, linchpin of the Racing attack, set the pattern when he sent a header soaring over Iker Casillas in the 24th minute. But Michael Owen, relishing an unaccustomed place in the starting line-up, seized his chance to pull the two sides equal with a header after 35 minutes. Six minutes after the break, Javi Guerrero slotted in a pass from Benayoun that found him alone in the area, putting the visitors behind again. However, Ra\u00fal levelled the score 10 minutes later when he knocked a header from Walter Samuel over the line and the game looked to be ending in a draw as both sides struggled to find the net, until Zidane sealed the victory. Real moved to second place nine points behind Barcelona, who were playing champions Valencia later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
