Actually, I love a bad rock autobiography, too: even a book that's guarded and self-serving and craven reveals something about the star behind it. But there was a time, not long ago, when I thought the rock autobiography was a dying art form. Most artists you wanted to hear from had already put pen to paper \u2013 McCartney, Dylan, Johnny Rotten \u2013 and the ones who hadn't were clearly determined to take their secrets to the grave. All you were left with were people with no secrets to tell or whose secrets you weren't particularly interested in: umpteen members of US metal bands, all carrying on as if they were the first people in history to work out that vast quantities of cocaine aren't necessarily fulfilling. But Keith Richards' Life changed everything: it won awards, sold millions and got people excited in a way that no Rolling Stones album had for decades, because it was more interesting than any Rolling Stones album for decades. In the wake of its success and the face of a vast publisher's cheque, a certain kind of rock star decided that their privacy perhaps didn't need policing as zealously as all that. So it is that this year brings autobiographies from two of rock's most gnomic figures, Morrissey and Neil Young, as well as the Who's Pete Townshend and the Manic Street Preachers' controversialist-in-chief Nicky Wire. Those four are exciting because they have a way with words, as does Tracey Thorn who, as anyone who follows her on Twitter knows, is hootingly funny in a way that rather contradicts Everything But The Girl's dour image. Exciting for reasons other than prospective literary merit are Rod Stewart and John Taylor from Duran Duran, whose autobiography is apparently called \u2013 and I'm not making this up - A Million Little Seductions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
