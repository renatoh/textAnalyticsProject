And Queensland's tourist board pats its bulging pockets as the world's media jumps on the story. If you didn't already know (spoiler alert), one of the Brits goes on to win and we follow his arrival on the island, grinning like a cat that inherited a dairy. JNR Can I Get High Legally? 9pm, BBC3 George Lamb explores the world of legal party pills, powers and \"herbal highs\" that can be acquired in shops or over the internet, none of which involve the furtive exchange of banknotes in a pub car park. He meets people who take them, a man who sells them but also a doctor who attests that, just because they're legal, it doesn't make them safer than Class A drugs - indeed, they may well be more dangerous. Not unlike tobacco and alcohol. He travels to Guernsey, a hotbed of legal highness, especially among the younger folk, before eventually deciding to try one for himself. DS Gerry's Big Decision 9pm, Channel 4 A cross between Secret Millionaire and The Apprentice, this is a show where two recession-hit businesses are profiled - and business guru Sir Gerry Robinson must decide which to save. Tonight, two small breweries, both making good beer, are under his gaze. It's all done fairly tastefully, given that what we're doing is, essentially, watching people begging for survival in distressing times, and much of that is down to Sir Gerry himself. A former priest, he's a cross between Sir Anthony Hopkins and Rick Stein and seems to be that rare thing, a likable man in business. JR Reaper 9pm, E4 Season two already? Really? What still gives Reaper the edge over a raft of similar supernatural comedies is its trump card - the very brilliant Ray Wise. His satanic soliloquies (\"I have been soiling innocent maidens since the beginning of time\") are frequently little masterpieces of invective. This week, Wise's Devil has lined up 20 - no, make that 40 - psycho-souls for Sam to collect, with a single cattle prod. Cue a sweet Fantasia-referencing visual gag set to Tchaikovsky's Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. AJC"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
