So it was on Wednesday. Before his turn we had been treated to the inevitability that was Kazakhstan 0 England 4 and Steve Claridge, in an attempt to rev up 606, saying something along the lines of: \"So, six out of six for Fabio Capello's England [pause to think of talking point] but I can't help thinking the level of performance has dipped slightly. What do you think? Rob from Mitcham.\" \"Hi, Steve.\" \"Hi, Rob.\" \"Great show by the way. I just think, it's staring us in the face what the problem is.\" \"Yes, Rob?\" \"They've got to get rid of Lampard.\" And so it goes on. Whatever the problem, sacking Frank is the answer. At one stage, sources tell me, Gordon Brown was thinking of drafting him into his cabinet just so he could gain some short-term popularity by dispensing with his services in the next reshuffle. He's the only Englishman to hold down a place in possibly the strongest midfield in club football, yet he's the one most constantly vilified. Baffling. Anyhow, having seen off the mighty Kazakhs, next up in the week of footballing inevitability was a country with a population of 69,150 in its last census. If Andorra had been playing a team of similar size, say Newmarket, then it might have been watchable. The mighty Andorrans versus a team of jockeys would at least have had curiosity value. As it was they were playing \"one of the favourites for the World Cup\" (\u2122 most pundits) and it was achingly predictable. Yet still the analysts analysed as if there was something worth analysing. And no one mentioned that the principality had no back four, midfield, or strikers. ITV had paid good money to cover the event; they, of all people, were going to pretend it was an event. The pretence normally would have been sustained for the full two and a bit hours; instead, and gloriously, at half-time Jimmy Greaves(right), pictured, hove into view and, owing nothing to no man, pointed out that the Andorrans had no players and questioned the sanity of anyone bothering to watch the non-event. The interview was briskly terminated, but the myth that because something costs money to acquire it must per se be of value had been punctured. What was frustrating was that this fake mythologising took place during a week when two sporting events, which truly bordered on the mythic, took place. First, there was Chris Gayle. Few visiting cricket captains have been so traduced. His efforts in leading his side to their first Test series victory for five years forgotten. His calm when his coach threw away a one-day match ignored. He told it as it is and he was slaughtered. His West Indies side were routinely condemned as a pathetic shower. And then they played Australia. And Gayle, with one monumental innings, stood up to cricket's most effective machine and stopped it in its tracks. At the end of his innings he allowed himself a smile. And most of the Aussies, realising the epic nature of what he had achieved, smiled too. The next day, Roger Federer bested even Gayle. Tennis's poet has been trying to succeed in Paris for a decade. When he finally did so the tears came easily for him and many of those watching. Once again the vanquished played their part with his opponent recognising the magnitude of his achievement and then saying, nicely, \"no one beats Robin Soderling 11 times in a row\". Sport can amaze. It can be imbued with grace and dignity. But often you have to look beyond the front pages or the back pages, you have to look beyond football in order to find them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
