And so it was in an early meeting with Steve Bannon \u2013 in 2010, when Trump was considering a presidential run to unseat Barack Obama \u2013 that Trump encountered the concept of populism. In a scene captured in the journalist Bob Woodward\u2019s new book Fear: Trump in the White House, Bannon told Trump that he (meaning Trump) was for the common man, against crony capitalism and insider deals. \u201cI love that,\u201d Trump said, according to Woodward\u2019s account. \u201cThat\u2019s what I am, a popularist.\u201d Woodward completes the scene: \u201c\u2018No, no,\u2019 Bannon said. \u2018It\u2019s populist.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Yeah, yeah,\u2019 Trump insisted. \u2018A popularist.\u2019\u201d Ever since the first passages of Woodward\u2019s book emerged on Tuesday, a week ahead of its official release, Trump has been playing defense, tweeting statements of denial by his secretary of defense (who compares Trump to a \u201cfifth- or sixth-grader\u201d in the book) and his chief of staff (who calls Trump an \u201cunhinged\u201d \u201cidiot\u201d in the book). The president has dismissed the book as \u201clies\u201d. Woodward, the extremely decorated Washington Post reporter, has written multiple books about every White House going back to Bill Clinton, including a trilogy called Bush at War. His book All the President\u2019s Men describes his investigation with his colleague Carl Bernstein of the Watergate affair, which led to Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation. In Fear, a copy of which was obtained by the Guardian, Woodward describes a chaotic White House in which policymaking comes down to desperate thefts by staffers of documents from the president\u2019s desk, decisions by military leaders to ignore the president and Ivanka Trump\u2019s whims. Woodward based his book on anonymous sources seeming, from the composition of many scenes, to include the former National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, the former chief of staff Reince Priebus and the former chief strategist Bannon. The book is rich with scenes from inside the Trump campaign as well as the White House, including the moment when Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, convicted of eight felony fraud counts last month, was challenged to explain a reported $12.7m in cash payments from a Ukrainian political party. The payments were exposed by a New York Times investigation that Manafort had known about for two months without bothering to mention it to anyone else inside the campaign. When confronted, he said, according to Woodward: \u201cI had expenses.\u201d Here\u2019s Bannon describing his efforts to reconcile with the Republican establishment during the general election campaign: \u201cI reached out and sucked Reince Priebus\u2019 dick.\u201d (Before his job with Trump, Priebus was chairman of the Republican National Committee.) In one scene, the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, the original head of Trump\u2019s presidential transition team, scolds Bannon for enabling Trump\u2019s worst instincts. \u201cBannon half-wanted to say, \u2018You fat fuck, let\u2019s throw down right here,\u2019\u201d Woodward writes. When the president moves into the White House, however, Woodward reports, the campaign infighting morphs into a process of haphazard policymaking on issues as urgent as whether to send more troops to Afghanistan or Syria, or to withdraw from the Paris climate accords. In those areas, Ivanka Trump held particular sway, Woodward writes: \u201cPriebus would be meeting in his office with a handful of aides from the economic team and the National Economic Council for 15 minutes and in would walk Ivanka. She would sit down and often say nothing. \u201cWho is this person? Priebus marveled. What is she doing?\u201d Ivanka Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, made a few stabs at brokering a deal on immigration reform with congressional leaders, Woodward reports, and he seems to have waded into, and then mostly out of, Middle East policy. But Kushner\u2019s main role in the campaign was to help make spending decisions for his father-in-law, to which the answer was almost always \u201cno\u201d, according to Fear. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a lot of cash,\u201d Kushner is quoted as saying. In March, Forbes magazine put Trump\u2019s net worth at $3.1bn. Melania Trump, the president\u2019s wife, is described as being devoted to her son, Barron \u2013 and adamantly opposed during the campaign to appearing on television at her husband\u2019s side as part of damage control after the publication of an Access Hollywood tape in which he described groping women \u201cby the pussy\u201d. \u201c\u2018Not doing that,\u2019 Melania said in her Slovenian accent, dismissively waving her hand,\u201d Woodward writes. \u201c\u2018No way. No, no, no.\u2019\u201d The book bursts with frustrated aides, bewildered cabinet members, blindsided staffers, and a passel of senior policymakers who have not been reticent in airing their extremely low opinions of the current president. At the center is the man himself, congenitally insecure, narcissistic, thin-skinned, compulsive, venal and dishonest. Woodward\u2019s book describes how the president has handled calls to military parents whose children were killed in the course of duty. He lies to them, Woodward reports: \u201c\u2018I\u2019ve got a record here,\u2019 Trump said. \u2018There are reports here that say how much he was loved. He was a great leader.\u2019 \u201cSome in the Oval Office had copies of the service records. None of what Trump cited was there. He was just making it up.\u201d Bannon\u2019s first impression of Trump is described as \u201cArchie Bunker, but a really focused Archie Bunker\u201d. But Cohn\u2019s estimation of the president, as reported by Woodward, is simpler: \u201ca professional liar\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
