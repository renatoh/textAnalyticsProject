Sunderland\u2019s manager, their fifth in three and a half turbulent years, had just been asked if he would be happy to finish fourth-bottom of the Premier League next spring. \u201cYes, I think I\u2019d take it,\u201d he said, before adding an important caveat, emphasising his ambition of being the man to end Wearside\u2019s seemingly interminable cycle of short-term fixes and seat-of-the-pants relegation escapes. \u201cI\u2019d take it if I felt I\u2019d brought players in who would help us progress, give us a backbone.\u201d The former Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad manager made it clear such resilient spines take time to knit and cannot be constructed overnight. Yet without such a framework it will be impossible to fulfil his twin aims of restoring Sunderland to a position of eminence and proving he really is one of the game\u2019s best managers. Moyes remains convinced United did not offer him a proper chance and suggested Louis van Gaal\u2019s troubled Old Trafford reign highlights precisely why patience was required. \u201cManaging Manchester United gave me an unbelievable idea of what life\u2019s like at the top,\u201d said the 53-year-old, looking slim, trim and slightly understated in a smart but conservative blue suit and tie. \u201cI believe that [the top] is where I can work and where I should be working and where my level is. That\u2019s what I saw in the time I was there.\u201d The shattering experience of being sacked only 10 months after succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson could easily have broken a different personality but Moyes feels strengthened \u2013 and, strangely, vindicated \u2013 by that sojourn. \u201cYou don\u2019t get offered those big jobs \u2013 Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United \u2013 for no reason,\u201d reflected a coach whose latest club have not made a signing this summer. \u201cI\u2019ve said all along I was unfairly treated there. When you sign a six-year contract and you end up with 10 months \u2026 I didn\u2019t win enough matches but you must say there were mitigating circumstances. And I think you could say there are maybe things which have gone on since then that would actually justify that even more so.\u201d As Van Gaal\u2019s once sure touch began to desert him in Manchester, Moyes was experiencing Spanish culture shock at Real Sociedad with that job, too, culminating in the sack last November. \u201cI had a great time in Spain and I believe I\u2019m a better manager now,\u201d he said. \u201cI got a chance to see a different culture, a different mentality, a different type of football, a different way of doing things. There\u2019s an awful lot of bullshit out there but it was a great experience. \u201cIn Spain I came up against arguably the best teams in the world and the best players in the world. I hope to be able to use what I\u2019ve learnt here.\u201d His reputation may have taken a few knocks since he left behind 11 largely successful years at Everton but Moyes\u2019s confidence remains undented. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve anything to prove,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got the fourth best win record of any Premier League manager. I have a big job here to get the right players in, with the mentality I need to be able to change things and play the way I want.\u201d If that style is likely to be slightly less pragmatic than that of his predecessor, the England manager, Sam Allardyce, Moyes made it clear he is no slave to philosophy. The days when Lee Congerton, Sunderland\u2019s former director of football, spoke of the team pioneering \u201ca Spanish style with a British heart\u201d and Martin O\u2019Neill, another managerial predecessor, dreamed of turning them into \u201canother Barcelona\u201d are clearly long gone. \u201cWhat I want to do is win,\u201d said Moyes, sounding very much in keeping with the zeitgeist of an era in which Leicester City are Premier League champions and similarly unfrilly Portugal won the European Championship. \u201cI\u2019d like to excite our supporters. I want to see crosses and goals scored with the head and I want to see good defending. There are very few successful teams that don\u2019t have the best defence. We saw a different European Championship this summer and I think England are now saying they\u2019d like to go back to a playing style which is normal for them. \u201cPeople want to see winning football, commitment and a good attitude. I want all that too but I also want to see my team improve and be good on the ball. There\u2019ll be differences to Sam. But, if I have to win ugly I\u2019ll do it, then try to improve the ugly bit.\u201d There has been precious little beauty about either Sunderland\u2019s football or loss-revealing balance sheets in recent years and Moyes appreciates many peers may regard his task as unenviable. \u201cThe biggest thing is that squad\u2019s short of numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s down from last season. There\u2019s no doubt we have to make signings. \u201cWe\u2019re short of a right-back, we\u2019ve only got one centre-forward in Jermain Defoe [whose thigh injury makes him touch and go to be fit for the start of the season] and I\u2019d like to strengthen in most areas but, the truth is, I won\u2019t get it all done this summer.\u201d In an ideal world Moyes would sign Marouane Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj from Manchester United. \u201cI\u2019d love to get that level of player, that\u2019s my aim,\u201d he said, before suggesting Januzaj was a rather more realistic prospective signing than Fellaini. \u201cIf those players want to come to the north-east I\u2019ll drive down to Manchester and pick them up.\u201d That pair would walk straight into a side who only narrowly escaped relegation in May. \u201cI think Sam did brilliantly to keep Sunderland up; what he did was amazing, incredible,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cI turned this job down last autumn [before Allardyce succeeded Dick Advocaat] and the main reason was because I didn\u2019t think they could survive.\u201d Since then Sunderland have returned the loanees Yann M\u2019Vila and DeAndre Yedlin to Rubin Kazan and Tottenham respectively. \u201cWe need competition for places,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t have that.\u201d Ellis Short disappointed Allardyce with the size of his transfer budget this summer but Moyes, courted several times previously by Sunderland\u2019s owner, clearly retains faith in both the American financier and Martin Bain, the new chief executive. \u201cEllis has given me carte blanche to do what I need,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cI trust him. Am I going to get a player at \u00a350m? No. But I know he will do everything he can to make things happen for me and I\u2019ve also been really impressed with Martin Bain. I have assurances we can improve the squad. We may not be paying outrageous figures but wheeling and dealing is part of the job now.\u201d In many ways the new challenge reminds him of the once he faced at Goodison Park. \u201cI\u2019ve had many opportunities to take other Premier League jobs and also to work abroad again,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cThe Premier League has an exciting group of managers and I want to compete against them but the big thing is Sunderland\u2019s brilliant potential. \u201cWe get around 45,000 fans every week, we\u2019ve got a great stadium and training ground, and we\u2019ve got an owner who reminds me an awful lot of Bill Kenwright at Everton. Bill allowed me to build a club. I didn\u2019t have a great deal of money \u2013 \u00a35m a year was all I was ever allowed \u2013 but I think our recruitment was as good as anywhere. I\u2019d argue we had the best recruitment in the Premier League\u2019s history. \u201cI think Sunderland have got a lot more in place than Everton \u2013 the stadium for example. But we need to change from just bobbing along at the bottom of the league and I hope I get time to put my vision in place. We can\u2019t always just buy players just to stay up. We have to bring in players for the long term who will maybe take six months to make an impact but are right for our journey. \u201cIf we don\u2019t progress, we could fall off the cliff at any time \u2013 but I\u2019m confident in my ability. If I can build a good team, we\u2019ll get this place jumping. That excites me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
