What with Granny Fiver's gin habit and Weird Uncle Fiver's disturbing bongo fetish, the Fiver was no stranger to child labour as a boy. Remember that spotty, gangly, burger-flipping oik with the pocketless trousers, lank hair in a net and absolutely no stars on his name-badge that served you your very first Happy Meal in McDonalds? He was the Fiver's pimp. But after enjoying a couple of years of moderate success \"collecting spare change\" round the back of King's Cross train station, the Fiver's career went downhill when he jacked in his comparatively respectable rentboy gig to start churning out this sort of blather and guff for The Man instead. And now it seems Gordon Strachan has learned from our mistakes, as the excitable flame-haired Scottish manager announced earlier today that he will not - repeat not - be doing one from his cushy gig as Southampton manager to take over the fast-sinking deathship that is Leeds United. \"I am a very happy man here, and I will not walk out on this club to join anyone else,\" chirruped an ecstatic Gordon on Southampton's website, as he idly stabbed an Agustin Delgado voodoo doll. \"There is not a problem with money or transfer funds or with the relationship with the chairman which is as good as any in the league. I am very happy with the way this club is run and the policies here.\" And if the scarlet expression he was sporting on Sky Sports News this afternoon is anything to go by, the chairman in question was either embarrassed by his employee's praise, or had just been caught on camera perusing Weird Uncle Fiver's collection of rare literature. \"Gordon is doing a great job, he has a great squad and a great spirit in the camp,\" red-faced Rupert Lowe countered bashfully. \"It is important everyone understands there is no issue with our relationship or contracts or transfer funds. Both of us are comfortable where we are. Gordon is entirely committed to this club, we are both comfortable with where we are and we are going in the right direction.\" Which is more than The Fiver can say about his sorry lot in life. Even if, like Leeds, its woes are entirely of its own making. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We play five games in 14 days. Some of my players are not playing in their position. We are still without Milan Baros\" - Yes, it's Ged getting his excuses in first again. And this was before Michael Owen was ruled out for three weeks with a thigh strain as well. God knows what he's saying now. STORY CONTAINING THE FIVER'S LAST EVER MENTION OF THE PHRASE \"DO ONE\" (NEARLY): THE END OF AN ERROR The Fiver has long felt an affinity with Paul Gascoigne. Not because we awake every morning with a fresh hangover and stale chilli sauce down our 54HH comedy breasts. Nor because we like to smear Weird Uncle Fiver's jockstrap with Deep Heat and set light to Granny Fiver's beard when she's asleep. Gazza doesn't get up to that kind of puerile japery any more. No, our empathy stems from the fact that, although it's been patently obvious for years that we've lost what talent we may once have had, we persist with the same disappointing and fast-deteriorating performance season after season, interspersed with worryingly long episodes of losing it BIG STYLE! But this morning, a man for whom the phrase \"time gentlemen, please\" had previously been an invitation to shut the curtains and open another keg decided to do one. And coincidentally, following our lead, Gazza today decided to bring an end to his Premiership career. (A Premiership career that actually ended in 2002, if we're honest with ourselves, but contrary to our counsellor's wishes, we never are.) After a brief stint of blowing out his cheeks (both pairs) on a Wolves training ground, Gazza has finally run out of gas. \"Gazza has decided that he can't cut it at Premier League level,\" said Wolves manager Dave Jones, breaking the news gently. \"He has gone away to think about what he wants to do.\" Of course, Gazza has \"gone away to think about what he wants to do\" plenty of times before, as rehab clinics in London and Arizona still bear testament. But this time it seems Gazza has just returned to the (fake) bosom of his family in the north-east for some TLC before launching his latest comeback at a Sunday league side near you. \"Gazza has been fantastic to have around the place and I am sure some other clubs will make him an offer,\" said Jones. The Fiver would like to get in there with the first offer. So Gazza: feel free to gate crash our leaving drinks at Cafe Kick from 6pm. We still love you. THE RUMOUR MILL Franchise FC's Nigel Reo-Coker is doing one. He's off to Cardiff. West Brom are trying to entice Dean Ashton and Pablo Counago to do one from Crewe and Ipswich respectively. Having been told to do one by Dundee, several English clubs are sniffing around Fabrizio Ravanelli, say Football Transfers. They don't say who. Canterbury City? Basingstoke Town? Who? NEWS IN BRIEF Bryan Robson has made his first purchase at Bradford. No, it's not a four-pack of Midland Mild to keep in the office sideboard; it's Bolton midfielder Gareth Farrelly. Shares in Manchester United rose towards a three-year high today after a German bank confirmed it had bought a stake in... no, we can't be bothered to report any more of this. Chris Perry's loan from Tottenham to Charlton has been made permanent after the two clubs agreed a nominal fee for the defender. Dundee United winger Andy McLaren has signed a new deal which will keep him at the club until the end of the 2004-5 season. Shefki Kuqi will join Ipswich on a permanent basis from Sheffield Wednesday. And Sven-Goran Eriksson has named his six to watch in Euro 2004: Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry, Raul, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Pavel Nedved and Luis Figo. With insight like this, he could have a future as a newspaper columnist.
