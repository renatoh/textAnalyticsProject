The Conservative party has refused calls to drop Francesca O\u2019Brien, who is standing in a key target seat in Gower, south Wales, despite anger after her Facebook comments were exposed by the Guardian. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the minister in charge of the country\u2019s benefits system, said it was a \u201cmatter for the people of Gower\u201d on whether O\u2019Brien should be the constituency\u2019s next MP. In posts unearthed by the Guardian that have since been deleted, O\u2019Brien, 32, wrote in January 2014: \u201cBenefit Street..anyone else watching this?? Wow, these people are unreal!!!\u201d In response to a friend\u2019s comment, she wrote: \u201cMy blood is boiling, these people need putting down.\u201d In further comments under her post, O\u2019Brien apparently endorsed a friend\u2019s suggestion for \u201ctwat a tramp Tuesday\u201d to \u201ctake your batts [sic] to the streets\u201d. Asked whether O\u2019Brien should be a candidate given her comments, Coffey told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWhat she said is clearly wrong, clearly wrong. I\u2019m led to believe it was early in 2014. I don\u2019t know Francesca at all. \u201cShe has apologised I\u2019ve been told, that is important. And I recognise that these comments are not ones with which I would associate myself in any way.\u201d Pressed again on whether she should be standing, Coffey added: \u201cI think that will be a decision for the people of Gower to make the choice on who they want to be their next member of parliament.\u201d A spokesman for the Conservatives confirmed the party was standing by O\u2019Brien despite her comments prompting widespread outrage. The Labour party\u2019s chair, Ian Lavery, said: \u201cRemoving a candidate who used such vile language about people on benefits should be a no-brainer. \u201cThe cuts to benefits and universal credit programme that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey and her party are responsible for have forced people into poverty. \u201cIt is shameful that Boris Johnson is allowing Francesca O\u2019Brien to stand for his party in Gower. This reveals the Conservatives\u2019 contempt for the less well-off.\u201d Benefits Street, which highlighted the lives of benefits claimants on a road in Birmingham, prompted controversy when it aired in 2014. The programme attracted 4 million viewers but also more than 100 complaints to regulator Ofcom of unfair, misleading and offensive portrayals of benefits claimants, alleged criminal activity and excessive bad language. After being approached by the Guardian, O\u2019Brien \u2013 who was selected last month in an open primary \u2013 apologised for the comments which she said were \u201coff the cuff\u201d. She added: \u201cThese comments were made off the cuff, a number of years ago. However, I accept that my use of language was unacceptable and I would like to apologise for any upset I have caused.\u201d Gower was won by Labour by little more than 3,000 votes at the 2017 general election and is a key marginal that the Conservatives will be targeting. It was won by the Tories in 2015 by just 27 votes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
