He seems to be reading a poem. \u201cI said to the man who stood at the gate of the year / Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown.\u201d I can feel my nails dig into the palm of my hand as his voice vanishes, perhaps for ever, into some dark pit from which it emerges suddenly with a gasp. Very like my father\u2019s car which stops and starts for no obvious reason. \u201cGive me a light.\u201d The words are simplicity itself. A child can understand them and remember them. As I do. The royal family are not partial to posh poetry. The Queen Mother was once reported describing a poetry recital at Buckingham Palace during the war. \u201cA rather lugubrious man in a suit read a poem. I think it was called The Desert. At first the girls got the giggles and then I did and then even the king. We didn\u2019t understand a word. Such a gloomy man, he looked as if he worked in a bank.\u201d It was Old Possum in person who, when not dashing off The Waste Land, did indeed earn a crust in Lloyds. In view of the hostile audience reaction, someone should have warned TS Eliot to switch to his Book of Practical Cats. When you really are in the waste land, slap in the middle of a world war, you need a teaspoonful of sugar to take the taste away. \u201cWe will meet again\u201d the Queen\u2019s parting words were \u2013 give or take an apostrophe \u2013 a pop song. And as No\u00ebl Coward said, how potent cheap music is. It goes nonstop to the heart. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet again\u201d comes trailing golden associations of an impossible war we managed to win and Vera Lynn, who is apparently indestructible, and blue skies and blue birds. Well, perhaps not blue birds. Simple, memorable, cheerful and chin-up. It is also, conveniently, very popular at funerals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
