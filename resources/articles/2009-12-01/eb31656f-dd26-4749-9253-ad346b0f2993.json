His club are coming round to the idea that he may have something to offer. He made only 15 Premier League starts for Manchester United in the whole of last season but there have been 11 already in this campaign. The winner of the 2009 BBC Sports Personality of the Year award often gives the impression that the best is yet to come. It has to be an illusion when Giggs, at 36, seems the key to a team's future but the audience is left spellbound because they cannot imagine how the trick has been done. His colleagues, too, for all that they watch him at close quarters day after day, seem to be in awe of Giggs's sleight of foot. The motives of Paul Scholes could be treated with scepticism since, at 35, he has personal reason to speak up for the enduring importance of old pros, but the midfielder talked about Giggs with a sense of wonder that was obviously sincere. \"He's the best this club has ever had,\" said Scholes. \"To be here for 20 years and still be as strong and as fit as ever and playing as well as ever, I think he can be the only one to really stand out.\" That is a quite a claim, considering the case to be made at Old Trafford for so many more in a litany of legends. Giggs does set himself apart in one specific way. For an outfield player who is forever required to bring vibrancy to the attack, the longevity of his relevance is uncanny. In his youth the Welshman cut a fashionable figure and, as a winger, could not hope to dodge comparisons with George Best which have turned out to be misplaced. The Northern Ireland player had his last outing for United at the age of 27 in 1974. Best, with his disordered life beyond the pitch, destroyed his talent with a thoroughness that was beyond the scope of vicious defenders whose brutality was then considered acceptable. Sir Alex Ferguson must be applauded for instilling self-discipline in an outstanding generation but the manager was also lucky that Gary Neville, Scholes, Giggs and others were innately serious about their ambitions. Willpower set them apart as much as aptitude. Without it Giggs's career might have been curtailed rather than, as it seems currently, extended without limit. The hamstring problems were the subject of much agonising and, for instance, he stopped driving sports cars and got behind the wheel of duller vehicles. That sacrifice still was not the answer and Giggs records that he ultimately had to stop himself from running at full tilt. A few other players have reinvented themselves at the top level of the sportbut we ought to pause and reflect on the discipline and determination it entails. How, for instance, can a person be fully committed to victory while stopping themselves from stretching that hamstring dangerously? The main answer must be that Giggs had the scope in his game that made it feel just as natural to be a schemer. No one foresaw that when he was a youngster obsessed with outstripping full-backs. Genuine wingers have become rare at the highest levels and few anticipated that he would one day inflict a subtler misery on the opposition. He is accomplished in the areas behind the attack from which he can send others tearing beyond the defence. It must sometimes feel as if he is passing the ball to the modern versions of his former self. Entire eras of United history are packed into his career. Giggs broke Sir Bobby Charlton's club record of 758 appearances when he was brought on as a substitute in the 2008 Champions League final. His penalty in the shoot-out then defeated Chelsea. It was no cue to call a halt to the exertions despite his retirement in 2007 from international football . Giggs has now taken the field for United 821 times. He is in a period where United's need of him is rising. With Cristiano Ronaldo sold, Nani yet to convince anyone that he can be a major contributor and Scholes betraying signs of age, Giggs's name is not being put on the team sheet out of sentiment. Ferguson is as dependent on him as he has ever been. Luckily for the manager, Giggs, despite that period of hamstring concerns, appears to have an inherent fitness that is not easily undermined. To the public at large and the people who conferred the BBC prize on him, his hoard of medals is of secondary interest. The rewards that count for most lie in the enjoyment he has given to anyone who can rejoice in a great and seemingly ageless talent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
