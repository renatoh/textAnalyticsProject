In this rare venture into stage drama, written in 2005 \u2013 two years before his death \u2013 he returned to his original mode. The result, I fear, is a strained, effortful piece that shows just how much the genre had moved on. Exton clearly aims for comic outrage since the first words we hear on stage are \"You cunt!\" They are addressed by Chrissie, a supposedly archetypal Essex girl, to her husband Darnley who has just blown his chance to make some big money. Invited on to Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? Darnley has not only revealed his dumbness (he couldn't even work out what Little Bo-Peep had lost) but ruined his jackpot chances by landing one on Chris Tarrant. And if Chrissie and Darnley's mother, Emmie, are aghast at his failure, it is with good reason: it turns out they have squandered the vast amount of loot stashed away by Darnley's violent younger brother who is due out of the nick any moment. I have no objection to the cascade of four-letter words beginning with \"c\" and \"f\", even if I don't find them as inherently hilarious as the first-night audience did. What troubles me is that Exton constantly invites us to laugh not just at his characters' coarse materialism but at their bottomless ignorance. Emmie proudly announces that Darnley \"wouldn't know a book if it hit him in the bollocks\"; a mention of Alfred Tennyson prompts the response: \"Did he used to play for Millwall?\"; and, asked to define global warming, Emmie answers \"Oh, it's when the Russians are coming, innit?\" People have compared Exton to Joe Orton. The whole point about Orton, however, is that his characters commit outrageous acts while speaking with Wildean precision. A more relevant comparison might be with Richard Bean's Smack Family Robinson, written shortly before this play and revived recently at the Rose, Kingston. But Bean's play rested on the joke of a dysfunctional, drug-dealing family striving for suburban respectability. That strikes me as ten times funnier than Exton's idea of a criminalised Essex family wallowing in their crudity. Comedy, after all, springs from the unbridgeable gulf between aspiration and reality. Under Harry Burton's direction, a star cast make a decent fist of pumping some life into a dud idea. Lee Evans as Darnley shows a nice line in open-mouthed dismay and gets to do a passably funny imitation of Carmen Miranda brandishing her maracas. Deploying all her formidable professional skill, Sheila Hancock as his mum also hints at what the play might have been by greeting every horrific revelation with a casual matter-of-factness. And even if the gorgeous Keeley Hawes is not given much to work with as a stereotypical Essex girl, Karl Johnson extracts what humour he can from the role of a superannuated hitman. But it's a sign of the evening's crushing obviousness that Simon Higlett's set indicates the family's vulgarity by decor including plastic deer antlers and leopard-skin curtains. The play has one good surprise gag in the second act but otherwise, as a piece of black comedy, it is neither sufficiently dark nor consistently funny. Until 4 January.
