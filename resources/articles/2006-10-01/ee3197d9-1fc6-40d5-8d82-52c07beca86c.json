Last season, we are informed, was not a vintage one. There were too many mis-matches. The format breeds predictability. The standard of rugby badly needs to rise. And so on and so on. Total rubbish. It is akin to a millionaire holidaying for a fortnight in the Caribbean and complaining about a couple of overcast afternoons. Any tournament spanning eight months of the northern hemisphere winter is bound to contain the odd sub-par 80 minutes. Only the blas\u00e9, or a terminally disenchanted Englishman, could use that simple fact of life as clear proof of a pan-European malaise. What about Leinster at Bath or Toulouse last season? Did Munster go into their shells when the pressure was on? If you want to be laughed out of Wales, try telling spectators at the seething Liberty Stadium in Swansea tonight that the event is growing stale. They would hardly pay their money if the rugby was reliably dire. What about Italy, represented by three teams for the first time? It is not the Heineken Cup organisers who should be concerned, but those still insisting Test rugby is the only genuine show in town. Would you rather watch Brian O'Driscoll's reliably entertaining Leinster versus Gloucester's exciting youngsters at Lansdowne Road tomorrow, or Ireland against the Pacific Islands at the same venue next month? Thought so. The hegemony of tribal loyalties over mere accidents of nationality is growing stronger. It is that irresistible force - the local hero factor - which continues to drive the Heineken Cup onwards and upwards. It is also a crucial consideration when trying to pick a winner. The most talented teams do not always lift the trophy but the thread linking Leicester, Toulouse, Wasps and Munster, who have dominated for the past six seasons, has been a refusal to countenance defeat even in the most extreme circumstances. It has nothing to do with clich\u00e9d national traits and everything to do with squad unity. It is no accident, either, that no tournament winner has ever lost more than one game en route. Heineken champions do not creep in via the back door. If any club loses more than one of their six pool fixtures, their chances of making the last eight are slim. It may sound perversely premature, but the key to this season's tournament will be the opening weekend. If Gloucester lose in Dublin, for example, they simply have to triumph in Edinburgh and Agen, probably with a bonus point attached. Ditto Leicester, who cannot afford to go to Munster with qualification in the balance. Sale, are in a tough pool which will be awash with blood if they lose to the Ospreys tonight. Only Northampton, in a much weaker group, could wriggle through after a slow start. Overmach Parma and the Borders are rank outsiders but, lest anyone forget, English club rugby also has much to prove. It is not just Ronan O'Gara who thinks England is full of emperors with empty wardrobes. The Ospreys coach, Lyn Jones, saw London Irish at the weekend and thought them so poor he was amazed they had qualified for Europe. Then there are the French. Those with a foot in both camps, like Wasps' hooker Raphael Iba\u00f1ez, warn against underestimating the threat from across the Channel ahead of next year's World Cup. The French clubs have already played 11 rounds of their championship and their players have more incentive than usual to catch the eye of the national coach, Bernard Laporte. Ultimately, it comes down to one ingredient: desire. People can talk about styles or individuals but collective will-power and big-match aptitude are the critical elements in Europe. Into that category currently fit the following: Sale, Gloucester and Wasps from England, all three Irish provinces, the big three in France - Stade Fran\u00e7ais, Toulouse and Biarritz - and the Ospreys, the strongest Welsh candidates. Three of the above have been drawn together. Some reckon the overall winner will duly come from Pool Three, but there is an equal chance of the big boys punching each other out. With only five days' preparation, the Sharks may be undercooked against the Ospreys tonight and will need to be extraordinarily resilient to beat Stade Fran\u00e7ais at Parc des Princes. The Parisians may find life less cosy in Swansea and Stockport. A home quarter-final may be beyond the pool winner. The silverware, as a consequence, could easily head elsewhere. Leinster and Biarritz are favourites to top their pools and should score freely enough to secure home quarter-finals - though O'Driscoll's men would have to play across the Irish Sea because of stadium rebuilding work. Ulster will surprise a few but for sheer, unvarnished desire - that word again - the warhorses of Munster and Wasps are my hunch for the final. Imagine O'Gara and Munster trying to repeat last year's magic against Lawrence Dallaglio and co at Twickenham on May 20. Then ask yourself if the Heineken Cup needs refreshing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
