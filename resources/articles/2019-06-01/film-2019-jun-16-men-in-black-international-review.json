The closest we get to a new idea is the casting of two women in black \u2013 Emma Thompson is the head of the New York branch of the covert organisation; Tessa Thompson is the probationary agent who finds herself relocated to London, where Chris Hemsworth is the star of a bureau that may have been compromised by a mole. The film borrows much from the structure and plot of the first movie, including some peripheral characters.
