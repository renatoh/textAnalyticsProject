The Premiership chief executive, Darren Childs, and his French counterpart, Paul Goze, both signed the letter addressed to World Rugby, the RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney and the France federation president Bernard Laporte, insisting that it was \u201cessential\u201d that the domestic leagues were involved in shaping the post-pandemic landscape. World Rugby has a contingency plan to reschedule the July tours \u2013 certain to be cancelled \u2013 for October, which, along with this year\u2019s postponed Six Nations match against Italy and their autumn fixtures, could see England play seven matches this autumn. The Premiership would hope its 2020-21 season is up and running by then however, while the Champions Cup organisers have also targeted October for completing this season\u2019s competition. Eddie Jones is guaranteed access to his players for England\u2019s match against Italy but it is believed there is no such provision under the RFU\u2019s agreement with the Premiership for a rescheduled tour of Japan in October. The Premiership has previously insisted that any structural changes to the season would have to be put to the clubs via the Professional Game Board but Monday\u2019s letter goes further and calls for a seat at the decision-making table. \u201cIt is essential that any possible changes of the competition periods devoted to the national teams can only take place after consultation and within the framework of an agreement with the professional leagues affected by such changes,\u201d reads the letter. \u201cThe exceptional situation must lead all the parties to show a spirit of cooperation and solidarity, we do not however imagine that club competitions should be the variable for adjusting the calendar management in the context of this crisis.\u201d Following re-election as World Rugby\u2019s chairman earlier this month, Bill Beaumont pledged cooperation with the clubs as part of an aligned global calendar but the letter signed by Childs and Goze outlines how they have asked the game\u2019s governing body to be part of the decision-making process several times and claimed their requests were not taken into account. World Rugby, meanwhile, says the RFU and the France federation have said they would prefer to deal with the leagues directly and insists the Premiership and Top 14 will be consulted over moving the July tours to October. A statement read: \u201cIn the event that there is necessary reorganisation of the international calendar to mitigate the significant competition and financial impact of Covid-19 on national unions, any remodelling will be undertaken in full consultation with all stakeholders.\u201d The Premiership clubs are waiting on guidelines from the DCMS before finalising plans to return to training after the government advised that sporting events can resume as of 1 June. The Premiership\u2019s best-scenario for restarting matches is late June \u2013 though July is more likely as players will need at least four weeks of full training before the league can begin. It is thought, however, that they will begin gradually in small groups depending on the DCMS protocols. Elsewhere, Andrea Pinchen has replaced Simon Cohen as Leicester\u2019s chief executive. Cohen has left the post with immediate effect after 15 years at the club with Pinchen, formerly chief operating officer, taking over. \u201c[Andrea] brings huge passion, commitment and energy to the club and was the board\u2019s unanimous choice,\u201d said Leicester\u2019s chairman Peter Tom. \u201cWe are sure she will be a great success in her new role and we wish her every success.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
