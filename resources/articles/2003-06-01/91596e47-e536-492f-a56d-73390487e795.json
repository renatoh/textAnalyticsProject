Symonds carried his bat and hit 96 off 37 balls, 24 of them in second over alone - off Ed Giddins, who went for three fours and two sixes. Hampshire had been put in and Simon Katich top-scored with 59 not out from 52 balls as they ran up 145 for six. Northamptonshire swept to their first victory when they overcame Glamorgan by 23 runs at Sophia Gardens. Mike Hussey was man of the match for his well-paced 79 not out in a total of 159 for five, and that after opting to bat and seeing Glamorgan's Michael Kasprowicz open with a maiden. The hosts were never up with the required run-rate, losing their first two wickets with only 27 on the board, and struggled from there on in. At Grace Road Brad Hodge hit the best score in the competition so far to steer Leicestershire to a 16-run win over Yorkshire and in front of more than 4,000 people. The Australian smashed 97 off 61 balls, with seven fours and five sixes, then took three for six in two overs. He was almost upstaged by Yuvraj Singh, who hammered 71 off 37 balls, but when he went Yorkshire lost five for 17 in five overs and finished 17 short."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
