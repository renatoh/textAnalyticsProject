What impact is the national obsession with immigration having on theatre? How is drama surviving in the current economic climate? And to what extent is theatre still director-dominated? But within minutes of arrival, I discovered that a new production of Der Blaue Engel was on at the Theater am Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, just across from my hotel. So, yielding to the pleasure principle, I put the big issues on hold and sped to the premiere. As an occasion, it was totally different from a typical West End first night. No paparazzi photographing C-list celebrities, no hysterical standing ovations, no mobile phones suddenly going off: simply a well-dressed, middle-aged, bourgeois Berlin audience enjoying an iconic German fable. The story began life as a Heinrich Mann novel in 1905, was made into a legendary 1930 movie starring Marlene Dietrich, and has been much adapted since. But what is striking about Peter Turrini's new version, which closely follows Mann's story but keeps the songs from the movie, is its ability to have it both ways. Its account of Professor Rath's infatuation with cabaret singer Lola offers a sardonic assault on the sacred German concept of Bildung: the belief that education creates virtue. At the same time, it offers the pleasure of seeing the black-suspendered Lola belting out Falling in Love Again. Played on a whirling revolve, it is very much the professor's show. Walter Plathe, a popular TV actor, gives the middle-aged teacher a rigid dignity that collapses under Lola's spell. On first invading her dressing room, Plathe removes a pair of knickers caught on his sleeve as if they were contaminated. Yet moral outrage turns to goofy adoration and ultimately humiliation: Plathe is superb in the famous scene where, dressed as a clown, he ends up part of the cabaret act with eggs being broken on his bald pate. And the final image of his death, slumped across a schoolroom desk, reinforces Mann's point about the precariousness of civilised values. Glamorous Eva-Maria Grein von Friedl, meanwhile, wisely avoids doing a Dietrich impersonation and turns Lola into a hard-hearted showgirl whose instinctive reaction to the professor's marriage proposal is to collapse into giggles. With the larger political ramifications of the story side-stepped, what you get is an acidic moral tale. This, of course, is boulevard theatre. But, at the other end of the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, is the famous Schaub\u00fchne. Under the direction of Thomas Ostermeier, its mix of new work and radically reimagined classics attracts a young crowd. Sitting in the theatre's vibrant cafe on a Saturday evening, surrounded by people chatting, reading or surfing the web, I felt I might have been in the Royal Court's downstairs bar. Ostermeier's own versions of A Doll's House and Hedda Gabler, as well as his sensational production of Sarah Kane's Blasted, in which the stage was finally reduced to a heap of rubble, have all been seen at the Barbican; and later this year he will bring us his much-acclaimed Hamlet, set in a mafioso-style eastern Europe state with six actors playing all the roles and Ophelia and Gertrude ingeniously doubled. Talking to Ostermeier, whose theatre is currently staging its 11th Festival of International New Drama, one senses a razor-sharp intelligence. On the topic of immigration, he sees the Schaub\u00fchne's function as, primarily, to enable others, through training and financial assistance, to address the issue directly without losing artistic autonomy. \"I'm a great supporter of the Ballhaus,\" he says. \"It's a small, 100-seat theatre run by a Turkish director, Shermin Langhoff, that does a fantastic job in training young Turkish actors and writers. It's important that they own the means of production, though, rather than for the Schaub\u00fchne to colonise their work.\" He goes on: \"I think the notion of German theatre as a refugee camp for an old idea of German monoculturalism and nationalistic values is stone dead. We have to recognise that we live in a multi-ethnic society and have to create a vibrant new theatre that goes beyond endlessly deconstructing the classics.\" As an example, Ostermeier points to a new German play that is part of his current festival: Regen in Neuk\u00f6lln (Rain in Neuk\u00f6lln) by Paul Brodowsky, which I saw and which, like much of the Schaub\u00fchne's work, carries English surtitles. It offers a vivid account of street life in a mixed-race Berlin community, sharply pinpointing current prejudices. A middle-aged taxi-driver, for instance, stalks a 17-year-old Turkish-German girl, automatically assuming her to be a prostitute. Her impoverished father, Ibrahim, is also instantly dismissed by everyone as another Muslim scrounger when he is neither. Eschewing straightforward realism, the play is a touching study not just of racial stereotyping but of human isolation \u2013 a point neatly symbolised by Sarah Rossberg's set, in which a pavement gradually fractures into a series of cobblestones on which people stand marooned in solitude. Aroused by a wolf in the garden Design, in fact, seems to be a major part of German theatre. And it is taken to extraordinary lengths in a play called Diebe (Thieves) by Dea Loher at the prestigious Deutsches Theater. Loher's play, like Brodoswky's, is about fear and isolation, told through the episodic interweaving of individual stories. The design, by the play's director Andreas Kriegenburg, is stunning: the massive set is like a rotating mill-wheel disclosing a series of separate compartments to which the actors cling precariously. It perfectly embodies the play's theme \u2013 that we all lead tragically fragmented, disconnected lives. British actors required to work on such a set would, I feel, either protest to their union or ask for danger money. Running to three-and-a-half hours, and once again surtitled in English, Loher's play could hardly be accused of understatement. But some scenes, such as one in which a suburban couple are sexually aroused by the threat of a wolf in the garden, are striking. And Loher's vision of human solitude is shot through with humour: an old woman, reporting her husband's disappearance to the authorities, finally reveals that it had happened 43 years ago and announces: \"I'm starting to miss him.\" It was the dominant design, however, that really hit me. But then everything about the Deutsches Theater is on a grand scale. It has no less than 60 productions in its repertory, spread over three auditoria, has a state subsidy of nearly \u20ac20m (\u00a317.2m) and employs a staff of 282 people. In terms of funding, it is comparable to our National Theatre, yet one should remember that, in Germany's widespread theatrical culture, cities such as Hamburg and Cologne boast similarly well-endowed institutions. On the basis of three days in Berlin, it's difficult to come to lofty conclusions. But several things struck me. One is that Berlin exudes confidence. The 1990s were a time of financial crisis here, with the sacrifice of the Schiller Theater and the Freie Volksb\u00fchne as major producing venues. Today, however, commercial shows like The Blue Angel or We Will Rock You (at the Theater des Westens) co-exist with the cutting-edge internationalism of the Schaub\u00fchne and the traditional model of total provision at the Deutsches. I also sense that Berlin theatre is stronger in acting, direction and design than it is in new writing. Ostermeier quotes a famous occasion in 1997 when he was working at the Baracke, the Deutsches Theater's studio space, and assembled a panel composed of Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, Stephen Daldry and Phyllis Nagy. At one point, apparently, Kane loudly declared: \"Why all this fuss about British playwrights? You have to discover and support new writers of your own.\" To some extent that has happened over the intervening years, with the emergence of dramatists such as Marius von Mayenburg and Roland Schimmelpfennig, both of whom have been seen at the Royal Court. But Ostermeier thinks too many German dramatists are damaged by acclaim while still young; he feels they bring little experience of real life to theatre. Leading German financier Thilo Sarrazin notoriously claimed that the country is threatened by the growing number of under-educated Muslims. Germans have even coined a word \u2013 translatable as \"integration-discourse\" \u2013 for the subject. In theatrical terms, the debate is very much focused on Berlin's tiny Ballhaus: it is good to see that its Verr\u00fccktes Blut (Mad Blood), about a teacher who uses Schiller's The Robbers as a way of coping with classroom violence, will be part of this year's Theatertreffen, a month-long showcase of the year's best German theatre. I left feeling that German theatre is at an important crossroads. It has a lot going for it. But how does it reconcile the traditional bourgeois audience's hunger for the classics with the need to address the country's multi-ethnic reality? It's similar to the dilemma we face in Britain. I suspect the future of theatre depends on how it is resolved. The ugly, the dirty, the queer and the bad Five big names in the world of German theatre Karin Beier Germany's most feted director at the moment: whether adapting the classic Italian film Ugly, Dirty and Bad, or staging the newest play from Nobel prize winner Elfriede Jelinek, Beier can do no wrong with critics and audiences alike. Kevin Rittberger One of the most cerebral director-playwrights of his generation, Rittberger has found a congenial mind in sci-fi author and political poet Dietmar Dath, whose work he has adapted twice. Lena Lauzemis A cast member of Munich's prestigious Kammerspiele, Lauzemis is currently playing Baader-Meinhof terrorist Gudrun Ensslin in the German film Wer Wenn Nicht Wir (If Not Us, Who). Nis-Momme Stockmann Stockmann's bleak stories full of raw language have won him more prizes than any young playwright in the past few years. Matthias Lilienthal As artistic director of Berlin's three-theatre ensemble HAU, Lilienthal's output is nothing if not diverse: from a musical by raunchy electro pop star Peaches, to the latest work by barrier-breakers Rimini Protokoll, as well as a conference asking: \"What is queer about queer pop?\" Hannah Pilarczyk, arts writer for Spiegel Online"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
