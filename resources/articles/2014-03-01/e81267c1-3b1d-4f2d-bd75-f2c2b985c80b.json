This was according to a piece in the Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s supplement Good Weekend (not online), written by John van Tiggelen, who even verified the fact with Hardy\u2019s housemate. Now I\u2019m no prude, and Hardy is a self-described \u201chedonist, raconteur and bon vivant\u201d, but the piece, which also made repeated references to Hardy\u2019s seductive consumption of a green-iced vegan cupcake, left me with an intensely uncomfortable feeling. There was just something that permeated the writing like the unwelcome attention of a relative who\u2019d had one too many. At the time I tweeted my pithy disdain, considered it a satisfactory feminist protest on my part, and left it at that. Fast forward to Wednesday when I\u2019m browsing the New Yorker (online and during a lunch break, because time for newspaper weekend indulgences are long gone). This time I\u2019m reading a profile of Scarlett Johansson by Anthony Lane where she appears as if \u201cmade from champagne\u201d, her laugh \u201cdry and dirty, as if this were a drama class and her task was [sic] to play a Martini\u201d and her backside, \u201cbarely veiled in peach-colored underwear\u201d. As Slate points out this is not the first time Johansson has inspired \u201cculture writers to do horrible things with words\u201d, but that\u2019s not the greatest crime here. We\u2019re all familiar with the concept of the \u201cmale gaze\u201d, particularly when it comes to Hollywood film \u2013 the lens lingering on the curves of leading ladies\u2019 derrieres (Lane talks of Johansson\u2019s \u201ccontours\u201d of reputation) \u2013 a scopophilic guilty pleasure. And, let\u2019s face it, women\u2019s bodies are delightful things to look at, one of the reasons media executives conveniently argue that the economics of the industry make it impossible to avoid stereotypes of women. But when respected male writers profile powerful women, is it wrong that we should expect more than lengthy, voyeuristic wet dreams? In the cases of both Hardy and Johansson, the writers of their profiles are accomplished and well-regarded. Their audiences, a \u201cnew intelligentsia\u201d, are likely to congratulate themselves on their progressive values. Their subjects are powerful and sexually subversive women. Yet in both cases the women are reduced to something resembling not much more than titillating, slightly fearsome, but ultimately decorative objects. What is at play here is a struggle between high profile media men and the threat they feel from their female counterparts. I\u2019m not suggesting that van Tiggelen and Lane, and other male writers of their ilk, are deliberately trying to subvert female power, but their approach to their famous female subjects does exactly that. They are both threatened and enthralled by their \u201cunknowable\u201d female subjects, on which they publically (and awkwardly) project their male desires. There\u2019s not much of an attempt to comprehend them beyond their sex appeal. Quite simply, men writing about women can all too often make men seem stupid, and it\u2019s not OK \u2013 for either sex. Despite the gradually increasing number of female journalists on a global level, it is largely men who remain in decision-making roles. They also make up the bulk of columnists (in the US the ratio is one woman to four men). Increasing diversity at senior levels of media organisations would help introduce more informed perspectives. Though female writers can be as guilty of cliches (I\u2019m no exception), they at least are less likely to drop in the pervy overtones that pervade so much male writing about strong and successful women. Commissioning women to write profiles of leading women would solve two problems at once. Readers too should expect better and express our disdain when we don\u2019t get it. Male writers, for their part, need to understand the broader implications of lazy, laddish prose. You can\u2019t have equality without respect. It pains me that in 2014 I need to point out \u2013 to the New Yorker, of all places \u2013 that successful women are more than a pair of \u201cnice tits\u201d or \u201cpeach-colored underwear\u201d .
