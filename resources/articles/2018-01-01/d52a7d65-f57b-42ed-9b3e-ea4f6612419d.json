Looking back has never really been his thing. If it were, as he admits, he might linger on his life going full circle in restoring him to the club he supported as a boy, \u201cwalking with my dad to watch the reserves one week, the first team the next\u201d from their regular vantage point on the bleak concrete of the Holmesdale Road terrace. Or hoarding programmes, a youngster craving an audience with Johnny Byrne or Terry Long \u201cand waiting to collect autographs by the changing rooms\u201d. It had been a sense of Crystal Palace\u2019s underlying ambition, and a desire to fling himself back into work 14 months after leaving his role with England, that convinced him to return to the club where a career spanning more than half a century had begun with evening sessions in the youth team. Yet, when Hodgson allows himself a second to contemplate, he can acknowledge some would spy romance in last autumn\u2019s return. His father, Bill, was a geordie who had moved to the capital before the second world war, then returned from the fighting to marry and settle as a bus driver in the suburbs south of the river. \u201cHe regarded himself as a Londoner but he had two teams: Newcastle from his youth and then, when he came down to Croydon, he was Crystal Palace all the way,\u201d Hodgson says. \u201cHe watched the game. Just before he died, we knocked Internazionale out of the European Cup with Malm\u00f6 [in 1989] and I was really happy he lived at least to see that moment. But to see me at Palace? I\u2019m sure he\u2019d have been very proud. He\u2019d have loved it.\u201d A little over four months into an appointment that had underwhelmed many outside this corner of south London, the doubters blinded by memories of England\u2019s failures at recent tournaments and assuming this was a broken man, it is hard not to admire the rejuvenation instigated by the country\u2019s most worldly wise manager. At 70, Hodgson is on his 20th coaching assignment, yet his appetite for hands-on coaching is as fierce as ever, his enthusiasm and energy infectious. It has rubbed off on his players, from Wilfried Zaha to James Tomkins, Bakary Sako to Martin Kelly. They are revived. The job he has overseen is far from complete but feels remarkable. Palace had endured the worst start to a top-flight campaign, losing seven games without scoring, a sequence that included Frank de Boer\u2019s four-match tenure. Hodgson had arrived as a firefighter to stumble almost from the off into brutal batterings at the two Manchester clubs. The situation was grim. But, in 16 games since and despite a lengthening injury list, Palace have earned 25 points. Their opponents on Saturday, Arsenal, are the only side to have beaten them in the last 12 league matches. There must have been times \u2013 as the wheels came off at the Etihad Stadium or when stoppage-time penalties were saved against Bournemouth and at home to Manchester City \u2013 when he contemplated the logic in resuming his career. \u201cI\u2019d have laughed if someone had told me, in 1976, I\u2019d still be doing this at 70. I assisted Bobby Houghton at Halmstads and we were both just under 30. We\u2019d say: \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be great to do this for maybe 10 years, save a little money, then perhaps start a little business together.\u2019 Some sort of travel agency. We had no football thoughts beyond that, other than maybe combining it with a bit of sport, getting a few tours going. It was a very loose plan and the wheels fell off it many years ago. \u201cIt is a sadistic pleasure. The suffering never stops \u2013 that\u2019s the problem. A lot of young coaches who respect the fact I have been doing it a long time \u2026 that is often their question. Does it get any easier? Can you relax more during the games? Can you take it all a little bit more philosophically and put it in perspective? The tragedy is I have to tell them: \u2018No. If anything it gets worse.\u2019 Getting that first foot on the rung of the ladder, that\u2019s where you find it easier to shrug off those times when your foot slips off and you have to get yourself going again. When you have been lucky enough to move up, all you see is the slide back down. You don\u2019t see the further steps upwards. \u201cYou learn to harden yourself towards it but, the longer you are in, it isn\u2019t something you can give up lightly. It\u2019s not something you can walk away from and, even if you\u2019re not winning, it\u2019s possible to derive some satisfaction from the fact you are working properly. But I suffer during games. We follow the action, kicking every ball, wondering if our centre-backs can stop the cross \u2026 In some ways you enjoy it but your heart is always thumping.\u201d The sight of Pep Guardiola joining him in the dugout in stoppage time in the goalless draw with City on New Year\u2019s Eve summed up the respect in which Hodgson is held by his peers. The pair spoke about the seasons their sides are enjoying. \u201cA nice conversation,\u201d says the Englishman. Hodgson will have admired City\u2019s style and panache, as well as their feverish work rate. \u201cI like the artistry of the game. I still get a lot of pleasure watching the good quality teams play, where the movements of the players are coordinated. It\u2019s almost balletic. There is so much interaction in a football match: between you and your team-mates and how you support each other, work for each other, make runs. But I also enjoy the other aspect: the pressing and how people work so hard to recover the ball.\u201d He inherited a squad whose confidence was fragile but who were eager to follow his lead. The structured nature of training has been embraced, sessions replicating game-play to encourage familiarity, clarity and a recognition of each player\u2019s role. It worked at Fulham and West Bromwich Albion, Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear anyone saying: \u2018What the hell are we doing this for?\u2019 In fact, quite the reverse. Quite a few came up to us and said: \u2018We like this. We need more of this. Please keep it going.\u2019 They take their lead from you: your energy, your enthusiasm. It does transmit. I\u2019m anxious as I get older to make sure that doesn\u2019t drop.\u201d In a congested bottom half, he has hoisted Palace to 12th and should be rewarded with forays into the transfer market. Everything about his appointment seems to fit. \u201cI\u2019m working at a club which has really good potential, with owners with the right ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only thing we are lacking is making certain we have the 11 players who can deliver total stability in the Premier League, where you are not looking over your shoulder every year wondering: \u2018Are we in or are we out?\u2019\u201d There lies his target. Over at Malm\u00f6\u2019s stadium the fans refer to the upper corner of the eastern stand as \u201cRoys H\u00f6rna\u201d (Roy\u2019s Corner). Maintain Palace\u2019s progress and Hodgson, back where it all began, will find adulation far closer to home."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
