Fox News had agreed to the request to remove Rivera, the former talk show host who angered the US military by revealing operational details of the Iraq campaign during a report, according to defence spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Dave Lapan. \"We have asked that he be removed and we are working with them [Fox News] to make that happen,\" Lt Col Lapan said. A spokesman for Fox News Channel was not immediately available for comment when contacted by MediaGuardian.co.uk. Earlier, Rivera went on air to dismiss reports that he had been ejected from Iraq for revealing tactical information about the unit he is based with, the US 101st Airborne Division. Mr Lapan said Rivera reported details of troop operations by drawing a line in the sand showing where his unit was and where it was going next. Reporters who are \"embedded\" with US troops are not supposed to disclose details that could help Iraqis figure out their location and plans. Rivera, Lt Col Lapan said, was put with his unit as a \"short-term embed\" meaning the military agreed he could accompany them for a couple of days. Fox News Channel's US rivals, CNN and MSNBC, both reported on Monday that Rivera had been kicked out of the country. But Rivera then delivered a report via satellite phone yesterday saying he was 60 miles from Baghdad and said claims he was being thrown out of Iraq were \"a pack of lies\" spread by \"some rats at my former network NBC\". \"I'm further into the country than I have ever been. I'm having a great relationship with the 101st Airborne. I intend to march into Baghdad alongside them,\" Rivera said defiantly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
