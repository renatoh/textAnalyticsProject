Boris Johnson will today launch his long dreamt-of campaign to be prime minister. On Brexit, he is expected to say: \u201cAfter three years and two missed deadlines, we must leave the EU on 31 October \u2026 Delay means defeat. Delay means Corbyn. Kick the can and we kick the bucket.\u201d Johnson, who has proven elusive in the leadership race up until today, is expected to take questions from the media at his launch. A Guardian investigation has revealed the former foreign secretary allowed arms sales to Saudi Arabia despite civilians being killed by its brutal bombing campaign in Yemen. Rory Stewart, an outsider in the leadership race, has become the first contender to criticise the former foreign secretary personally: \u201cIs this the person you want writing the instruction to the nuclear submarines? Is this the man that you want embodying your nation and guiding you through the most difficult choice we\u2019ve faced for 50 years?\u201d Sajid Javid, another leadership contender, is also planning to launch his campaign today, calling for change at the top of the Conservatives. * * * \u2018Retract, retract\u2019 \u2013 We are covering the situation live in Hong Kong where demonstrators are seeking to force a citywide shutdown over a proposed law allowing extraditions to mainland China. Politicians have temporarily abandoned their debate on the bill after tens of thousands of people surrounded the legislative council building and swamped the city centre to chants of \u201cretract, retract\u201d and \u201cno retraction, no retreat\u201d. The proposed law had been due for a second round of debate in the 70-seat legislative council today. Thousands of parents and teachers called for a boycott of work and classes to show their opposition to the proposed bill, which would allow mainland China to pursue fugitives in the former British colony. * * * Schools \u2018go cap in hand\u2019 for funds \u2013 The cash-strapped Downshall primary school in Ilford, east London, has asked BBC Children in Need for funding to support disadvantaged pupils. Its headteacher, Ian Bennett, said it was \u201ccriminal\u201d that the school had been forced to axe its team of two pastoral support workers because of budget constraints, as well as cutting back on reading support and PE staff. A Guardian investigation recently revealed more than 1,000 schools across England have turned to crowdfunding websites and wish lists to raise money just for basics. Kevin Courtney from the National Education Union said: \u201cHeadteachers are having to go cap in hand to beg money from wherever they can just to keep their heads above water.\u201d The Department for Education said while schools faced \u201cbudgeting challenges\u201d, Downshall had received an increase per student, and in the next spending review the education secretary intended to \u201cback headteachers to have the resources they need\u201d. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Theresa May will commit Britain to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050, making it the first major economy to do so. The measure will go before parliament today as an amendment to the Climate Change Act that does not require a vote. &gt; Labour will lead an attempt to legislate against a new prime minister forcing a no-deal Brexit. Britons claim in a YouGov survey that they are avoiding the news because of Brexit coverage \u2013 but in the media we\u2019re finding readers can\u2019t get enough of it. &gt; The government has ordered Whirlpool to recall 500,000 tumble dryers sold as Hotpoint, Creda and Indesit over a long-known fault that can make them catch fire. The number to call is 0800 151 0905 and don\u2019t use yours until it is fixed. &gt; It is 20 years since Nato troops were deployed to keep the peace in Kosovo. Tensions still flare between the Serbian and Albanian sides, and Dan Sabbagh writes that 3,500 foreign troops are still there \u2013 but with western attention fitful, how much longer will their mission last? &gt; The writer of the Chernobyl miniseries has called for tourists, like the Instagrammer who flashed her G-string, to show more respect. \u201cIf you visit, please remember that a terrible tragedy occurred there,\u201d said screenwriter Craig Mazin. * * * \u2018They did their job, do yours\u2019 \u2013 Jon Stewart has blasted Congress and its handling of benefits for 9/11 first responders and victims, telling US lawmakers their \u201cshameful\u201d inaction is \u201can embarrassment to the country\u201d. The comedian and former host of The Daily Show testified before the House judiciary committee at a hearing attended by only a handful of lawmakers. The US government has slashed payments to those sick and dying from the toxins released during the attacks. More than 20,000 individuals have suffered or died from cancer, breathing problems and other ailments resulting from 9/11. \u201cThey responded in five seconds. They did their jobs [with] courage, grace, tenacity, humility. Eighteen years later, do yours,\u201d said Stewart, who received a standing ovation at the conclusion of his statement. * * * Mental health toll of wars \u2013 One in five people living in war zones have mental health conditions, according to a World Health Organization paper published in Lancet. \u201cMental healthcare must be prioritised in countries affected by conflict, not least for the well-established links between mental health, functioning and country development,\u201d says the paper. Armed conflicts reached an all-time high in 2016 \u2013 53 in 37 countries, says the paper. About 12% of the world\u2019s population are living in a conflict zone and 69 million people have been forcibly displaced by violence \u2013 the highest number since the second world war. * * * \u2018Into the Weird Adult Video Emporium\u2019 \u2013 An environmentally minded grocery store in Vancouver is using plastic bags emblazoned with embarrassing slogans about porn and warts to try and discourage customers from asking for them. The only problem is, people love them. Today in Focus podcast: How not to start a political party Four months after it was set up, Change UK has already lost six of its 11 MPs. Heather Stewart, Guardian political editor, charts where it all went wrong. Plus Damian Carrington on plant extinctions. Lunchtime read: Hitting the mute button on the world Uber is testing out new features for users of its Exec service \u2013 including a button you can activate if you want to mute your driver. \u201cQuiet preferred\u201d is the euphemism Uber is using (you can also toggle it to \u201chappy to chat\u201d). It appears to bring the dream of being able to choose who and what we listen to a step closer \u2013 but there\u2019s growing evidence that cutting ourselves off like this isn\u2019t healthy, experts tell Richard Godwin. Sport The USA kicked off their Women\u2019s World Cup defence in style, with Alex Morgan scoring five goals in a record 13-0 thrashing of Thailand, while lightning and torrential rain stopped play for 45 minutes as Sweden laboured to a 2-0 victory over debutants Chile in Rennes.

Pakistan\u2019s captain, Sarfaraz Ahmed, does not believe today\u2019s match will see a repeat of the jeering that has been directed at Australia\u2019s former captain Steve Smith and former vice-captain David Warner. Gareth Bale missed a sitter in Budapest where Wales held out until the 80th minute before Mate Patkai gave Hungary a 1-0 win in Euro 2020 qualifying. And Tiger Woods has set himself a target of a decade more at the top level as he looks to overhaul the majors record of 18 held by Jack Nicklaus. Business Three Bank of England rate-setters have warned the UK remains on track to raise interest rates several times over the next couple of years. Such a move would put the country out of sync with other central banks because the US Federal Reserve appears increasingly unlikely to cut rates this year. Asian markets drifted lower overnight ahead of US inflation figures today. Closer to home, Nils Pratley rates Philip Green\u2019s chances of getting his Topshop rescue through. The FTSE100 is set to open down 0.25% while the pound is at $1.272 and \u20ac1.122.
