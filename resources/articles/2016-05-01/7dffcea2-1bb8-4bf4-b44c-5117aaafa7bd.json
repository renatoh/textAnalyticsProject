The federal cabinet secretary and former Howard government adviser last week week declined to give evidence before a Senate inquiry into Liberal fundraising groups such as the Free Enterprise Foundation (FEF). The inquiry is the latest in a series of investigations into a scheme before the 2011 NSW election to \u201cwash\u201d donations from property developers \u2013 illegal at the time \u2013 into Liberal party coffers. Sinodinos at the time was the party\u2019s treasurer and chair of its finance committee, but has denied any knowledge that a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount of the $700,000 donated by the FEF had come from property developers. He told Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph on Monday: \u201cI\u2019ve been under constant stress for the last three years over this.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve lived with that, my family have lived with it, and frankly it is something I would like to see the back of,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also impacted on the family, on our living arrangements and on my eldest son at school \u2014 he gets asked questions: \u2018Oh what\u2019s your dad been up to?\u2019 \u201cThe two younger ones are shielded from it, (but) I\u2019ve been concerned for him.\u201d The findings of an Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) inquiry into the donations have been delayed more than 12 months. Sinodinos admitted to Icac he had done \u201cnothing\u201d to determine whether the FEF funds were legally sourced, but the commission has indicated he will be spared any adverse findings. Nonetheless, he said the speculation over his role had left him anxious about his public reputation. \u201cI don\u2019t want anybody to feel sorry for me but I hope people will give me a fair hearing because I\u2019ve devoted almost all of my life to public service, and that is not the trait of someone that is just out seeking things for themselves,\u201d he said. Last week\u2019s Senate inquiry into the FEF and other fundraising groups was \u201ca witch hunt\u201d, he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been through two exhaustive and exhausting inquiries and I\u2019ve answered questions in the parliament about this going back two or three years, and I have been as accountable as anybody, if not more so.\u201d The NSW premier, Mike Baird, said in March the party had done \u201cthe wrong thing\u201d after the state\u2019s electoral commission ruled the donations had breached electoral funding laws. The commission has also withheld $4.38m in electoral funding until the party discloses the identity of the FEF donors. Sinodinos has threatened to take legal action over the report, which named the former assistant treasurer\u2019s testimony to Icac as part of the evidence it relied upon. He has also been questioned over his role as deputy director of Australian Water Holdings, which is accused of defrauding the publicly-owned Sydney Water and donating $183,000 to an alleged Liberal party slush fund."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
