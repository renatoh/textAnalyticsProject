So, too, did the sense that a major Scottish club would replicate its boys\u2019 academy setup for girls. Kevin Murphy delivers an uplifting counterpoint to both cliches. Hearts would have pressed ahead with the integration of their women\u2019s side into the club\u2019s main football department regardless of Scotland\u2019s qualification for the Women\u2019s World Cup. The wave of goodwill within the country on account of the achievements of Shelley Kerr\u2019s team simply means this move is well timed. Murphy swapped City\u2019s sky blue thinking for blue sky thinking when returning north to oversee a Hearts transition which will be formalised in November. \u201cI just believe girls should have the same opportunities as boys,\u201d says Murphy, who left his job as technical director of City Women to become Hearts\u2019 academy and women\u2019s manager. \u201cThey have the same dreams. It\u2019s unfair for a girl to grow up thinking: \u2018I\u2019m never going to play for the club I love.\u2019 \u201cIf there are sponsors or commercial partners we can attract then fantastic, we are open to that, but we want to give girls the same opportunity as boys. If you are at Tynecastle High School next door as a 12-year-old girl, you can have the same journey as a 12-year-old boy.\u201d Hearts landed a coup by hiring a Uefa pro-licence holder, who knows how buoyant women\u2019s football can be, from a member the game\u2019s aristocracy. \u201cCity is an incredible operation,\u201d he says. \u201cThe feeling of inclusiveness just hit me in the face. They talked about the women\u2019s game as much as the men\u2019s game. You saw that in the branding, in the resource, even inside the stadium, the club shop. Everything is equal and it isn\u2019t just propaganda; it\u2019s the core of the business. \u201cI\u2019ve had experiences in the past where it was: \u2018This is Kevin, he does the girls\u2019 stuff ...\u2019 I felt really important at City and I can honestly say I\u2019ve had the exact same, if not better, here. I know I\u2019m not fighting a losing battle; I\u2019m pushing at open doors. We feel we can have a massive impact.\u201d Until now, Scottish sides paid lip service to women\u2019s teams. Genders have shared strip colours but very little else. Ann Budge, Hearts\u2019 owner, put a plan in place years ago with a view to altering that landscape to the tune of six-figure annual investment. Budge\u2019s appreciation of life beyond traditional Scottish football boundaries sets her apart from so many owners. Roger Arnott, the head of the club\u2019s academy, soon became immersed. \u201cWe will have a [girls\u2019] academy run by the club,\u201d Arnott explains. \u201cHistorically things have been run as a grassroots team, within a charitable element or underneath the community arm. This will be part of the football club. The women come in, not on a full-time basis until we grow things, but as part of the football department. They get the same resource and support. It\u2019s absolutely about performance, about helping them get better as footballers.\u201d In practical terms, girls at Hearts will be introduced to the club\u2019s principles of play, improve technique through the Box Soccer programme and encounter paid staff in what was previously a volunteer-led domain. Hearts work with 250 boys a week from under eight upwards; dual-band age groups for girls mean the figure will not be identical but the scale of this operation is striking. A community element aimed at boosting participation and wellbeing will remain. The broader picture is fascinating. Glasgow City, a standalone club, have dominated the Scottish club scene for years. The national squad in France is made up largely of England-based players. In Scotland, contracts are amateur, meaning players can move without any compensation. Murphy feels calls for professionalism must be placed in context. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with having a vibrant league producing fantastic young players to go to England or Europe,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with us helping someone fulfil their dream. If we produce a player for seven years, she is a top player in Scotland and gets a big move down south, that shows our academy is working. We would attract players through having a reputation. \u201cWe need to grow it organically and slowly. It has to be sustainable. The last thing I want to see is clubs chucking resource at it, then it collapses. There has been a lot of evidence of that happening in Europe and America. One day I\u2019d love to have a fully professional Scottish league, 100%; I\u2019m just not one of these people who gets swept away and wants it tomorrow.\u201d Murphy raises an eyebrow when comparison between male and female players is raised. \u201cYou don\u2019t draw these with 100m sprinters or tennis players,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause this is the national sport we are ingrained with \u2018This is how football is\u2019. When we see a slightly different version of it, our brains can\u2019t compute.\u201d World Cup participation is a novel concept in itself. The Scottish women\u2019s scene should reap wider benefit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
