Charles Clarke will meet peers next week to try to persuade them that further amendments are unnecessary, pointing to the Home Office's last minute concessions on the proposed offence. The changes will ensure that individuals could only be charged if they intentionally encouraged others to commit terrorist acts, or were reckless in making statements that could be interpreted as encouragement. The government has also sought to win over critics by asking the anti-terror legislation watchdog to review the definition of terrorism. Lord Carlile will have a year to complete his task and MPs will be able to scrutinise his conclusions. Dominic Grieve, shadow attorney general, said the bill had been sufficiently \"improved\" to warrant opposition support in its final Commons stages. But problems remained with the measure's \"opaque and woolly\" wording on the issue of glorifying terrorism, which the Lords would do well to amend. It carries a maximum prison sentence of seven years. Hazel Blears, Mr Clarke's deputy, said in the Commons yesterday: \"I would say to members in the other place that I would want them to take note that when the elected chamber has voted on these issues, they should take that extremely seriously.\" But Kenneth Clarke, former chancellor, said the Lords now had \"almost carte blanche ... to see what can be made sensible out of the improved but somewhat battered bill\". While some of the many lawyers and ex-lawyers in the Lords may express disquiet at the Commons decision to extend maximum period of detention without charge to 28 days, it is unlikely to face serious challenge. Lord McNally, leader of the Liberal Democrat peers, said the upper chamber would examine the case for extension from 14 days and examine the oversight of detention. The bill is likely to go into committee next month and receive its final reading early next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
