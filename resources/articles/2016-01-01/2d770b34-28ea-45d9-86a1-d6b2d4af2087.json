In an interview with BBC Sport from his high-security prison in Florida, Stanford said he regretted the damage done to the sport following his agreement with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), which he claims was intended to revolutionise the game in the West Indies. Stanford signed a deal with the ECB in 2008 to play a series of five Twenty20 matches in the Caribbean, worth a combined \u00a310m, in an attempt to raise the profile of the game among young people in the area. England convincingly lost the first game against the Stanford Superstars by 10 wickets, with Stanford attracting criticism for what was considered to be inappropriate behaviour around the players\u2019 wives and girlfriends during the game. \u201cI had no idea those were the English players\u2019 wives and that created quite a bit of an uproar,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I apologised for it. I went over to the English locker room and I apologised to the guys. I said, \u2018Look I was just over there having fun with the crowd like I always do. I was just horsing around. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it.\u2019 And they accepted my apology.\u201d The following year he was charged with fraud worth \u00a38bn and sentenced to 110 years in jail, causing huge embarrassment to the ECB and in particular Giles Clarke, who was chairman at the time. Speaking to BBC Sport, Stanford said of the impact it had on the ECB: \u201cIt\u2019s very sad. I have nothing but respect for the English cricket board and I love the sport of cricket. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry. It breaks my heart and there\u2019s nothing I can say other than that was not caused by Allen Stanford. That was caused by the wrongful prosecution, an over-zealous and wrongful prosecution.\u201d He added: \u201cWill I apologise? No. Mark my words \u2026 I am going to walk out the doors of this place a free man.\u201d Of those in charge of the ECB at the time, Clarke \u2013 who stepped down as chairman in May 2015 \u2013 and the former chief executive David Collier, Stanford said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure if Giles Clarke is still the head person now but he and I got along well. And I think the world of David Collier. My dealings with the ECB was one of professionalism and one of mutual respect and I love cricket.\u201d Stanford insisted his intentions were to invest in and grow cricket in the West Indies. \u201cMy goal was to have a vehicle where I could uncover new talent, take the money that this tournament generated and pile it back into the island so that they could develop their own programmes, home-grow these young athletes and bring them to the Stanford 20/20,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would pick the best players out of the tournament. These would not be the superstars that currently play for the West Indies. These would be unknown young guys. \u201cIn the West Indies we have the greatest physical athletic talent for cricket anywhere in the world. They were just being diverted into other sports, whether it\u2019s basketball or soccer. There just wasn\u2019t that real incentive for them to stay and play in a sport that had not kept track with the 21st century and the modernisation of the sport.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
