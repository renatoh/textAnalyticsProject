This neurosis about the tube soon disappeared - except in jokes about Soviet hotel rooms - but has now made a comeback in paranoia over online search engines. A speech by the chief executive of Google, Eric Schmidt, raised the possibility that websites will soon know enough about users to suggest which job to apply for or where to go the following day. His promise that the company will \"get better at personalisation\" has been taken personally by lawyers and lobbyists waving sweat-stained copies of 1984 and imagining people run by machines. But these nightmare visions are based on the assumption that the user would take the advice. The hope for human individuality is our natural reluctance to be easily knowable. How many of us refuse on principle to buy any book recommended by an online retail site, or become quietly furious if we have confirmed our predictability by having already bought it from another site? Apart from this natural human desire to be mysterious, there are strong practical reasons for resisting internet tips. My fear when Amazon excitedly emails to say that, on the basis of my previous book purchases, I'm likely to enjoy That Stevenage Summer by Sven Jarkskold is that Jarkskolds must be proving hard to shift. Anyone who was docile enough to ask a search engine where they should live or go on holiday would be wise to consider that replies of, say, Peterborough and Thailand might not be unrelated to side-deals with development and tourist boards. This optimistic position only holds, though, if the technology is used only for its declared method as an electronic life-coach. Much of the nervousness comes from fears that keeping track of shoppers' preferences and movements leads to the average citizen undergoing a level of profiling previously suffered only by celebrities and criminals. In this respect, worries over Google-as-guru overlap with other Orwellian nightmares invoked this week: a senior police officer's concern about the way in which we have all become film-stars through the spread of CCTV coincided with reports that microchips fitted in rubbish bins, potentially allowing councils to fine those who fail to recycle, have now spread to 3.7m British homes. Some of the concerns about these observational technologies result simply from their chipping away at the concepts of privacy and choice, making the theme-song of modern life Their Way. But a more apocalyptic objection to surveillance cameras, bin-chips and software that anticipates our tastes is that devices promoted as helpful may one day be used to harm us, like a gangster's moll becoming a supergrass. The paranoiacs never quite spell out the ways in which all this information might be put to sinister purpose. But we can imagine, I suppose, some dark scenarios. The job interviewee or college applicant, after presenting at interview the image of a gentle, compassionate citizen, is suddenly confronted with a print-out of the hard-core horror movies they once liked to rent online. The divorce lawyer smirkingly unfurls a list of every car and tube journey the defendant made to an address of which they claim no knowledge. The surgeon considering whether to treat the heart or liver of a patient coldly questions their protestations of temperance by clicking up on the surgery computer their recent purchases at the supermarket, off-licence or tobacconist. Most of these hallucinations of data-abuse, though, are unlikely in practice because they depend on stored information being shared in a way which, as long as democracy more or less survives, would be prevented by law, public opinion or simply conflicting interests: the NHS and Oddbins, for example, have different views on boozing. The two groups with something to fear are those who, for different reasons, are less able to protect their information trail: stars and suspects. A public figure, in showbiz or politics, will always be vulnerable to the fuss or the bucks to be made from publicising details they once volunteered online. It's quite plausible that a politician or chief executive might one day resign because a leaked read-out from the chip in their wheelie-bin establishes them as a hypocrite on environmental policy. Another genuine threat is to the legal process. Might cases that lack strong forensic or eyewitness evidence increasingly be stiffened by downloading a personality or behavioural profile? So there is a risk of Google ruining some lives. What we don't need to worry about is the prospect of it running them. If anyone's stupid enough to do what a computer tells them, their problem is not that they might be losing their civil liberties but that their marbles have gone long ago. comment@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
