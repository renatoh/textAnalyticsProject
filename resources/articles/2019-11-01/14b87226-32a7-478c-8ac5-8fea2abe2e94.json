Bolton \u201cwanted to wait for a book instead of telling the American people what he knew\u201d, Schiff told CNN\u2019s State of the Union, drawing a contrast between Bolton and his former deputy, Fiona Hill, who appeared before the committee on Thursday. \u201cThe obligation right now to show the courage Dr Hill did,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cShe made the decision that this is the right thing to do. John Bolton should make the same decision.\u201d Bolton, who has said he had conversations with Trump and others relevant to the investigation, has resisted testifying, warning through a lawyer that he will file suit if subpoenaed for testimony. While he said he would prefer for witnesses such as Bolton and secretary of state Mike Pompeo to answer the committee\u2019s questions, Schiff warned that moving the impeachment process forward was \u201curgent\u201d, in order to prevent Trump tampering in the 2020 election. \u201cThere is a sense of urgency when you have a president who is threatening the integrity of our elections that we need to act now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is not deterrent \u2026 we can darn well be sure this president will commit even more egregious acts in the months ahead.\u201d Schiff said the impeachment investigation was ongoing and \u201cwe have continued to learn more information every day\u201d, but added that \u201cthe evidence is already overwhelming\u201d and said he hoped Republicans would rise to what he called a \u201cconstitutional duty\u201d to consider impeachment. The intelligence committee is working on a report it is expected to submit to the judiciary committee in early December, although the report could have \u201caddenda\u201d, Schiff said. \u201cWe don\u2019t foreclose the possibility of more depositions or hearings,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in the process of getting more records.\u201d The judiciary committee will decide if impeachment proceeds, and on what grounds. A vote in the House could likely pass largely on party lines but conviction in the Senate seems unlikely. The White House is preparing for a Senate trial, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, but Trump\u2019s team also has not ruled out that an impeachment vote would not be taken in the House. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing for both eventualities,\u201d she said. No Republicans in the House or Senate have said they favour impeachment. Schiff said he \u201cwould hope there would be Republicans who would be willing to step forward. It shouldn\u2019t matter that this is a Republican president. If this had been a Democratic president, I would be among those leading the way and saying we have to\u201d pursue impeachment. On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Schiff said: \u201cI mean they seem to be saying, \u2018Unless Donald Trump writes out \u2018I bribed Ukraine\u2019, the evidence will be insufficient. \u201cAre we prepared to say that soliciting foreign interference, conditioning official acts ... to get political favors is somehow now compatible with the office?\u201d he asked. On Sunday afternoon, the Washington Post cited three anonymous sources in reporting that an internal White House review had uncovered \u201cextensive efforts to generate an after-the-fact justification\u201d for the decision to withhold aid, efforts involving acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney which \u201ccould at a minimum embarrass the president\u201d, causing political and even legal problems. Mulvaney is among Trump officials who have refused to co-operate with the impeachment inquiry. Schiff continued: \u201cAre we also prepared to say that Congress will tolerate the complete stonewalling of an impeachment hearing or process? Because if we do it will mean that the impeachment clause is a complete nullity.\u201d Schiff said a party-line vote on impeachment was a possibility: \u201cI think it will mean a failure by the GOP to put the country above their party and it will have very long-term consequences if that\u2019s where we end up.\u201d Hill testified that US officials were engaged on a \u201cdomestic political errand\u201d in Ukraine, at odds with national security policy. \u201cIt became very clear the White House meeting itself was being predicated on other issues,\u201d she said, \u201cnamely investigations and the questions about the election interference in 2016.\u201d Schiff was asked about a CNN report which said his top Republican colleague on the intelligence committee, Devin Nunes, traveled last year to Austria and met with Ukrainians on a political errand targeting Joe Biden. The Democrat said the matter was for the ethics committee. If Nunes \u201cwas traveling on taxpayer funds to dig up dirt on Biden, that will be an ethics matter, that\u2019s not before our committee\u201d, Schiff said. Nunes has denied wrongdoing and threatened to sue CNN and the Daily Beast, which also reported the story. Over the weekend, Republicans continued to ignore a warning issued by Hill not to advance the \u201cfictional narrative\u201d of Ukrainian election hacking, which \u201chas been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.\u201d Trump has taken lead in advancing the narrative, out of an apparent desire to rewrite the history of Russian tampering meant to boost his 2016 campaign. Louisiana senator John Kennedy told Fox News Sunday it was impossible to know who was behind the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cNor do you. Nor do any of us.\u201d The US intelligence community has unanimously concluded that Russia was behind the election tampering, which has been forensically traced to an operations center inside Russia, whose Russian funding and ultimate direction by President Vladimir Putin has been documented."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
