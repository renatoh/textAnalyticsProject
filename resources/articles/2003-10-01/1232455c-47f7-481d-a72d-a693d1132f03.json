He imagines himself playing rugby for his country, reaching the tryline and touching the ball down as the roar of the crowd engulfs him. He imagines the glory and pride of playing for South Africa. The Springboks. The Boks. In September, Lungisa became the first black player to be picked as captain of the Western Province Under-13s. Selection for one of South Africa's eight provincial teams usually marks out the stars of the future; the ranks of the national team are made up of players who have come up this way. In the 100-year history of the game in South Africa, no black boy had ever captained Western Province Under-13s. Despite this historic breakthrough, Lungisa, who is a scrum-half, believes that he would have a better future if only one thing were different. 'It would be easier if I was white,' he said, ahead of training on an uneven piece of grass replete with a mini-lake in one corner near the tryline. (A drainage problem, said John Nkalitshana, the school coach.) 'Yes, I think there's prejudice. The white boys are always very friendly, but I think I would have a better chance if I was white. The whites have the power. I want to be a Western Province player, then I want to be a South Africa player.' Lungisa lives in Langa, one of the many 'black settlements' created in the 1960s and 1970s by the South African apartheid government to keep the natives away from white areas. In the years before Lungisa was born, neither his mother nor father were allowed out of Langa at night under the notorious pass laws introduced to keep black and white people apart. A 40-minute drive from the luxury of Cape Town's finest restaurants and vineyards, Langa remains a place of struggle and poverty. Men in filthy clothes sit around in huddles on the street; unemployment runs at up to 80 per cent. Most of the residents live in small, two-room concrete blocks with corrugated iron roofs. Many others live in shacks that get blown down during high winds. Some streets share a single Portaloo. Crime is rampant, with gangs from different areas battling it out with automatic weapons for control of the drugs trade. A short distance from where Lungisa was training, there had already been one murder that morning. A truck driver delivering bread was held up at gunpoint by three men. They took a bag containing 2,300 rand (\u00a3200), then shot the driver in the chest. A passer-by was also killed, hit by a stray bullet. Xhanti Lamani, 39, the community liaison officer with the South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu), had taken me to Zimasa Community School in Langa, where Lungisa plays on a patch of land surrounded by concrete huts. A former activist with the African National Congress, which swept Nelson Mandela to power in 1994 as the country's first black president, Lamani was jailed on several occasions for 'political' activities. He says he was held in solitary confinement for eight months and tortured. Lamani was appointed to his present post four years ago as part of attempts to develop rugby in impoverished black communities. As well as organising games with white teams, he hands out strips and balls at schools. Sarfu helped pay for the land the school uses as a rugby pitch. It is at pitches such as this, where black children play rugby in bare feet, that a new battle is underway, a battle over the future of a sport that is considered by the country's black majority to be one of the last bastions of white supremacy. As the national team prepare for the World Cup, the racial make-up of the sport has developed into yet another struggle for control of the country, as the black majority become more and more determined to have control of all the country's major institutions. Ever since Mandela cheered alongside the Springboks when they won the World Cup in 1995, rugby has been seen as a barometer of the racial health of the nation. With the pass laws repealed and Mandela elected as the country's first black president, the win against New Zealand in an epic final on home soil was depicted as a triumph for the 'new' South Africa - a country where people of all colours could live alongside one another and savour a shared golden sporting moment. But relations soon soured between the sport and the black majority as the country agonised over what the future held. Andre Markgraaf, the Springbok coach, was forced to resign in 1996 after discussing the role of 'kaffirs' and whether they had any place in the team. Then, in August, there was another racial incident when Quinton Davids, a black lock forward who had been selected for the national pre-World Cup squad, received a punishment drill (which involved extra training for an hour) when he complained that a white team-mate was refusing to sleep in the same room. The team-mate was Geo Cronje, a powerful, bearded, 23-year-old Afrikaner second-row forward. He, too, was given punishment training. Cronje, who is adored by the white Afrikaner community, was profiled in the September edition of SA Rugby magazine under the strapline: 'Can Geo Cronje save the Boks?' Former coaches explained how his lack of pace was not a problem because he was 'so strong'. He was also a 'great scrummager, kick-off receiver, line-out taker, cleaner in the rucks and tackler'. Cronje was, however, more self-critical. 'There's always a place for improvement,' he said. 'Sometimes I look at the games [on video] and I can't believe the shit I play. I can go lower in the rucks; I can put in bigger hits in the tackles. There's always room for improvement.' Since establishing himself in the Blue Bulls first team in the past year, following a rapid rise from schools rugby through to selection for the Springbok Under-21s, Cronje had developed a cult following after making his views known on the popular practice of having a post-match massage from the team physiotherapist. 'I think it's just a luxury for the guys,' the magazine quoted Cronje as saying. 'I wouldn't like it if someone rubbed my girlfriend [Carmen] all over and I don't think she would like it if someone did the same to me either.' Nor, it seemed, would he wish to share a room with a black man. The High Performance Centre, opened in 2000, is in a pleasant part of Pretoria, 50 miles from Johannesburg, down a wide, tree-lined avenue. There the elite of South African sport are taken once they have been identified as having international potential. There is an outdoor swimming pool, well-kept football and rugby pitches, and a hi-tech gym. There are medical staff and physiotherapists on call, a fully stocked pharmacy and a team of chefs to prepare balanced meals for the residents. Seven days after news first broke about the rift between Cronje and Davids, the Springboks held an open day there. The squad had spent the last five days in the bush, north of Pretoria, on what one player called a 'special-forces survival camp'. While they were away working on their fitness, the newspapers had been digging up conflicting accounts of what had happened between Cronje and Davids. Two days earlier, Mark Keohane, the Springboks' communications director, resigned, saying he could no longer tolerate certain attitudes in the squad. Keohane, who had joined the South Africa team from journalism, caused a stir earlier this year when he ghost wrote the autobiography of Chester Williams, the black winger who played in the 1995 World Cup. Keohane provoked uproar when he wrote that Williams thought he was used throughout his career as a 'token' black, a propaganda tool by the white authorities to pretend there was racial harmony in the squad. Keohane was unpopular among the white Springbok players. One called him a 'dead rat'. The Springboks decided on a high-risk strategy: face down any criticism of the team and categorically deny any racial tensions. Cronje and Davids were not present; they had not been selected for the final 30-man squad, despite an internal inquiry finding that allegations of a racial motive for the room row were 'inconclusive'. The mood was tense. The squad had taken a decision that each journalist had to interview the players en masse. Some of the players held tape-recorders, asking for the name of the journalist and which organisation he represented. The squad spoke as one: there had been no racism, the experience had helped pull them all together, they would prove their critics wrong at the World Cup. Some cynics in the South African media suggested that they only wanted to be together, when addressing the media, to prevent any of the five black players from speaking out of line. Alfred Mzizi, 35, a black coach, was working at the High Performance camp with the Springbok Under 23-team. He said that he had encountered racism, but it was often subtle, such as when a white player refused to carry out the correct training drills. 'It could just be a look, a way of doing something, that told you that you were not getting respect for the colour of your skin. It is never overt. You just know, as a black man, that it's being done to you.' Later, when the players emerged from the press conference, I spoke to Ashwyn Willemse, the gifted 21-year-old black wing and potential World Cup star. He was suspicious, demanding to know why I was trying to interview players outside the official news conference. Asked about racism in the squad, he replied: 'What is racism? If I don't like you, is that racism? 'We will come out of this stronger. What's not killing you is making you stronger. I can't say I have had any racial experiences. Some people just jump on racism too quickly for everything. These things can just be a misunderstanding.' He asked me to read back my shorthand so that he knew he would be quoted accurately, then jogged off. Joost van der Westhuizen, a senior figure in the squad and a veteran of the 1995 World Cup win, was equally uncomfortable with questions about race. Asked why there were so few black faces in the squad when the population outnumber whites by 40m to 3m, the scrum-half said it was ridiculous to talk about percentages: each player would be picked on merit. (There are 120,000 registered black players compared to 180,000 whites). 'There's no problem of race at all,' he told me. 'One guy wanted to room with someone else because he was used to staying with his best friend. That's it. There's no problem of race at all in this squad. I am very happy. This has helped us pull together. We are one unit now. 'This is a one-off tournament. One of the big five will win it: New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, England or France. I think England are the best team at the moment. The winner will have attitude and commitment.' He said it twice more: 'Attitude and commitment.' After the squad left for their final preparations in the high humidity of Durban, two senior black figures in South African rugby agreed to talk about the problems on condition that they were not named. They were in no doubt that there was racism throughout the South African game. The recent incident has prompted an offer of mediation from Mandela, who used to watch the Robben Island rugby team play matches during his 19 years incarceration. 'There are a lot of people trying to resist change in this country,' said one of the officials. 'On a daily basis you encounter that, sometimes openly. It's still all around. A human being hates the fear of the unknown. Here sections of the population for the past 48 years were made to think they were superior beings. Change is painful. It takes time.' The other official added: 'We see rugby as the unifier. We saw that in 1995. Let us take this game forward. Whenever such perceptions of racism come up, we must be able to thrash them. The team belongs to the nation. It does not belong to a section of the population. We want all 43 million people in this country to support the Springboks at the World Cup.' The problems in South African rugby cannot be separated from the problems of the country at large. The facts are straightforward. Most whites live inordinately well, albeit behind electric fences in heavily guarded homes, while the majority of blacks live in poverty. It is easier to concentrate on playing sport when you live well. Yet, in the same way that affirmative action has propelled more black people into senior jobs, the rugby authorities have introduced quotas to ensure more black players are picked at provincial and international level. Rudolph Straeuli, the Springbok coach, was reportedly urged to include six black and coloured players in his World Cup squad. It was said that he wanted to restrict it to four. The number, however, is now five, after Gcobani Bobo was forced to withdraw through injury and was replaced by the white Jean de Villiers. But some black professionals claim they are often substituted for a white player once the game is under way. These matters will be probed when Justice Edwin King, who headed the Hansie Cronje inquiry into match-fixing in cricket, has finished enjoying the World Cup. The retired judge was appointed last month - by Sarfu - to carry out an investigation into the Cronje-Davids affair. The inquiry was subsequently postponed until early next year in order to allow the players 'to concentrate on the tournament' - a move that prompted fury in the media and the abrupt resignation of two respected black experts appointed to assist the King inquiry. Neither Cronje nor Davids has spoken about the affair, and the postponement of the inquiry prevented the airing of a 21-page document, written by Keohane, about alleged incidents of racism in the Springbok squad. These are believed to include details of attempts to cover up the original incident, as well as details of general intolerance and prejudice. (One white player reputedly told Davids not to get 'uppity' about Cronje's refusal to share his room.) At The Sport Zone bar in Klerksdorp, a small town in the flat, scorching farming and mining areas of North West Province that stretches up to the border with Botswana, the row was being seen simply as another assault on Afrikaner culture, which was responsible for devising apartheid and installing Afrikaans as the official language. (English is now the chosen language in parliament and on television, along with Xhosa and Zulu. Programmes in Afrikaans are shown as minority interest). Klerksdorp, where Geo Cronje grew up, was once part of the stronghold of Eugene Terreblanche, the reviled white-resistance leader. In areas such as this, where Afrikaners set up home after being driven from the Cape by the British during the Boer war, rugby is approached with near-religious fervour. Here there are few, if any, black players. There were no black people in the bar; I was told they drank 'elsewhere'. I began to talk to some of the locals, who, at first, seemed relaxed about attempts to make the national rugby team more racially integrated. As karaoke blared out and more men arrived from local farms in pick-up trucks, attitudes and prejudice hardened. 'If you go all over Africa, you will see black Africans living in these huts,' said one of the men. 'That's what they want. They wouldn't like a house with larger rooms. It's their culture.' 'Listen man,' another guy said, 'have you heard what they do to babies? They rape babies because of some sort of African ritual that they think will cure them of Aids. Have you heard about \"muti\"? The police find bodies where the genitals have been cut off and other bits of the bodies removed. The Africans believe if you eat a young man's genitals, you will get his strength.' At Lichtenburg High School, a former all-whites school where Geo Cronje learnt to play rugby, a group of boys, watched by their parents, were playing touch rugby in the late afternoon sun. The boys were all white and all wore boots. As the boys trained, Martin Marks, one of Cronje's former teachers and coaches, doubted his former star would have been involved in a racist incident. 'He was a quiet, humble boy,' said Marks, who believed Cronje should be banned if evidence of racism was proven. 'We had no disciplinary problems with him at all. He was the perfect example of the gentle giant. 'We are trying to encourage more people to play rugby, but we need more investment in rural areas. There used to be three clubs here, each with three teams. Now there is one - and it struggles to raise three teams.' Asked what rugby meant to Afrikaner culture, Marks struggled. 'If you met a guy in the street, he would immediately want to talk to you about rugby. The black guys in this area play soccer. It's a generation thing. My kids don't think about race. But older guys believe it is a culture about one race being supreme. They need to start getting used to other people's habits. But all racial incidents [by Afrikaners] happen because of fear. They don't know what is going to happen. They think their lives are going to be replaced by blacks.' When the South Africa team return from the World Cup, they will not notice much difference in their country, whatever the result. Maids will still be black, the poor will be living in townships, the beggars at each street corner will be black, there will still be \"muti\" killings. The inquiry into what actually happened between Cronje and Davids will officially open in the new year, amid ANC calls for black and white players who have experienced racism to speak about what they know. It may not seem like much. Yet the system is changing, if slowly, with schemes to improve the game in black areas. Most of the black, white and coloured coaches who acknowledge the problem of racism concede that it will take years to transform the sport and the country - the average estimate was three decades for there to be something approaching social equality. South Africa, they point out, is a new country. It did not exist in its present form until nine years ago when Nelson Mandela came to power, ending the tyranny of white minority rule. Everything will take time, they say. But three decades can seem like a lifetime when you are a 12-year-old boy with dreams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
