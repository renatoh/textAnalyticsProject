It is a stark contrast to his predecessor, Nigel Pearson, who in the same room after a 3-1 defeat by Chelsea 10 months ago described a reporter who questioned him as an \u201costrich\u201d who had his \u201chead in the sand\u201d, before storming out in a huff. However, as the surprise Premier League leaders prepare for the first of their nine remaining matches this season, against Newcastle United on Monday night, in what could end up being the football story to end all stories Ranieri was keen to stress that he did possess a nasty side as well. \u201cThis season not often. At the moment, no,\u201d the Italian replied when asked if he ever raised his voice to his players. \u201cBut I am very clear in my face if I am angry. I change my face immediately and you understand if I am angry with you.\u201d With his team five points clear of Tottenham Hotspur at the top of the table, one wonders whether Leicester\u2019s players have experienced that at all this season. Ranieri has picked up where Pearson left off 11 months ago, with the club having won 24 and drawn 10 of their past 38 matches since beating West Ham United at home on 4 April - a total of 82 points. \u201cI don\u2019t like to speak a lot,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cI just say little things so they feel I am behind them. That is important for me. I prefer a good relationship. I have to tell them \u2018You don\u2019t play\u2019, but it\u2019s important they do everything right because in my career I always need somebody, so it\u2019s important at the right moment, when I call you, you are ready to play. \u201cSomething special happens if all the team are working well because a manager always needs all his players, not only the first XI. Sometimes the other players are more important than the first XI, because when you call one of them it\u2019s important they believe something could happen with them.\u201d Leicester\u2019s success this season has been built on a consistent team selection, with Ranieri having used only 23 players in the Premier League \u2013 fewer than any other club. The Italian was known as \u201cthe Tinkerman\u201d at Chelsea for his propensity to make wholesale changes for every match but admitted the squad he inherited from Pearson had enabled him to send out a more settled side each week. Yet despite his shift in attitudes, Ranieri insisted that he remained fond of his old moniker. \u201cNow everybody is a Tinkerman but the flag is mine. I was the first,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI moved a lot of players only in the last season at Chelsea when new players arrived after the start of the Premier League. [Roman] Abramovich came in at the beginning of July and at that point we started to buy new players, so it was normal that I changed players. Because of that I was the Tinkerman, but that is OK because I changed a lot. New players arrived so I had to put in new players and we finished second. \u201cSome players start to play straight away in the Premier League but other players need more months. Then you have to change things and move things.\u201d Leicester are likely to retain the side that beat Watford last week despite an impressive display from substitute Jeff Schlupp at Vicarage Road. Indeed, 13 of Leicester\u2019s squad have made 20 or more appearances in the Premier League already and Ranieri knows that consistency has been crucial to their success. \u201cI see a very good level and fitness, so why do I have to change? If I see somebody a little tired during a game or a training session, maybe I can change.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
