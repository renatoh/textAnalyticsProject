Given England have won their past 12 games it hardly needed a wellbeing survey to reach that conclusion and Eddie Jones has his own trusted method anyway. \u201cI look at their faces in the morning. Then I look at the figures \u2013 if the face is no good and the figures are no good then we have a problem.\u201d Winners, in other words, tend to be grinners and Jones does not need the latest hydration readings to know who of his players to unleash against Argentina on Saturday. Elliot Daly and the recalled Jonny May, Mike Brown, George Kruis and Tom Wood are all busting to tackle the Pumas and Jones is smart enough to tap into this primal force. \u201cScience gives you a base but rugby is not a scientific game,\u201d he said after announcing a starting XV notable for their upbeat body language. \u201cIt is a feel game: 60% art, 40% science. Small margins are for cycling. We\u2019re not cyclists, we\u2019re rugby players.\u201d This partly explains why the versatile Daly will fill a wing role against Argentina, rather than Bath\u2019s Semesa Rokoduguni, who scored two tries against Fiji and might have anticipated another run. Jones, however, is all about balance and blend; he does not necessarily require a backline full of sidesteppers against Argentina but he does want pace, energy and work rate, particularly from wings in other areas of the field. While Rokoduguni has also been advised to work harder on his defence, it is Daly\u2019s constant buzzing involvement that really attracts Jones: \u201cI always like to have one wing with real, genuine pace and the other wing to have work rate. If the wing with work rate also has pace, then it\u2019s bit of a bonanza.\u201d Whatever the number on his back, it is also clear England are finally recognising the rare talent at their disposal. Daly was a good enough cricketer to represent England Under-15s, runs like the wind, kicks goals from remote postcodes and absolutely loves winning. All he needed, in Jones\u2019s view, was the mindset that natural talent still needs constant honing. \u201cHe\u2019s been blessed with talent, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d said Jones, reflecting on his own school days alongside Australia\u2019s precociously gifted Ella twins, Mark and Glen, in Sydney\u2019s unfashionable Matraville. \u201cHe\u2019s a public schoolboy, holds up the trophy, has beautiful manicured hair; he\u2019s been one of those guys who\u2019s done everything easily. He was probably a good cricketer, the sort who gets 50 without blinking then gets a couple of wickets and takes a diving catch at first slip. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been to school with them. I went to school with the Ellas and they were the same. They could do anything. Then they get to an age when they have to say: \u2018Right, I\u2019m going to convert this to consistent performances\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m happy just being talented\u2019. Mark decided he wanted to be good and Glen decided he wanted to be happy. Glen used to sit on the tackle bag and Mark used to tackle them. \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing from Elliot Daly now is he\u2019s starting to tackle the tackle bags. We\u2019ve given him a roving role but he\u2019s also got a very good sense for the game. If you think back to the last England wing who was good like that it was a bloke called Jason Robinson. And he made England into one of the best attacking teams in the world because of his ability to attack from anywhere.\u201d Inside the squad Daly is also proving increasingly influential as the squad\u2019s go-to source for the best local coffee shops \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s an entertaining character,\u201d confirmed the captain, Dylan Hartley \u2013 but, according to Jones, he still has a way to go before he beats his fellow speed merchant May for maverick behaviour. \u201cI don\u2019t think he knows what he says half the time,\u201d said a sighing Jones, who played long enough with David Campese to know his subject. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll take that back, I\u2019m convinced he doesn\u2019t. I\u2019d love to spend one day inside his head. It would be absolutely fascinating but he is a bloody good rugby player.\u201d One day, insists Jones, he will pick Daly at full-back but, for now, he is determined not to underestimate Argentina, whom he rated as the second best team in the Rugby Championship, ahead of South Africa and Australia. While the withdrawal of the injured fly-half Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez is a major blow to the Pumas \u2013 Nathan Hughes is missing from England\u2019s bench with an injured foot \u2013 Jones has not forgotten how they ruffled New Zealand in Hamilton in September. \u201cThey out All-Blacked the All Blacks and to do that you have to be pretty good. Playing against Argentina is a test of your manhood \u2026 if they scent any sense of complacency in us they\u2019ll be all over us like a rash.\u201d To keep winning, in short, England must keep working harder: \u201cIf you look at the record of English rugby since 2003 there\u2019s only been one world-class player produced and that\u2019s Jonny Wilkinson,\u201d Jones said. \u201cNow we have a number who want to be part of a great team and who want to be great players.\u201d England team v Argentina Twickenham, 2.30pm Saturday Brown (Harlequins); May (Gloucester), Joseph (Bath), Farrell (Saracens), Daly (Wasps); Ford (Bath), B Youngs (Leicester); M Vunipola (Saracens), Hartley (Northampton, capt), Cole (Leicester), Kruis (Saracens), Lawes (Northampton), Robshaw (Harlequins), Wood (Northampton), B Vunipola (Saracens).
