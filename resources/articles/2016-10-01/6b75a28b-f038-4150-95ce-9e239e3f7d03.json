Which way will we go?", "bodyText": "On Friday, the state police ministers will meet to finalise the review of the National Firearms Agreement (NFA) including the fate of the Adler A110 lever-action shotgun. The importance of this meeting should not be underestimated. In summary, the ministers are deciding the future direction of Australia\u2019s gun laws. A future that could see the demise of Australia\u2019s strong gun laws and the continual rise of the pro-gun lobby. One issue which the states and commonwealth cannot agree on is the classification of the Adler lever-action shotgun. To understand the argument surrounding this firearm, it\u2019s important to understand the way firearms have been classified in Australia. In 1996, in response to the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania, where 35 people were shot dead and 19 others were physically injured, Australia implemented a new firearms licensing system that categorised firearms based on firing action, calibre and other criteria. The aim of this new firearm licensing system was to restrict civilian access to rapid-fire and self-loading firearms. These types of firearms can hold a large cache of ammunition and fire that ammunition within a quick time succession. For this reason, these firearms were, and still are, the firearms of choice when it comes to gun massacres. Each jurisdiction recognises five primary categories A, B, C, D and H. This licensing system is outlined in a document known as the National Firearms Agreement (NFA). In summary, category A firearms are the least powerful firearms and have limited firing capacity. They include air rifles, and single and double barrel shotguns. Lever-action shotguns fall within this category. Category B firearms also include some low level repeating firearm. Category A and B firearms are the most commonly registered firearms in Australia and may be owned for a range of sporting, recreational (hunting) and occupational purposes. Categories C and D include the more powerful firearms and are restricted. Category C includes semi-automatic and pump action shotguns with a magazine capacity of no more than five rounds. These guns are available to primary producers and some sporting shooters. Category D are prohibited firearms (except for official purposes) and include self-loading rifle and shotguns and military-style firearms with a magazine greater than five rounds. So let\u2019s get back to the Adler. In 1996, when the NFA was created, lever-action shotguns were single barrel and most could only hold one to two rounds of ammunition at any given time. The design of the lever-action shotgun has been based on an 1887 Winchester cowboy gun. The lever itself was often found to be quite clunky and difficult to use. For these reasons, these firearms were placed within category A. However, 20 years on and the new lever-action shotguns have come a long way. They are slicker, synthetic, hold more ammunition in the magazine, the magazine can be easily extended to carry more ammunition and they can propel the ammunition at a much faster rate. The only real resemblance to the old lever-action is the fact it has a lever, but other than that, it could just as well be a pump-action shotgun, which are category C firearms. There is no doubt recreational hunters were frustrated and angry with the restrictions imposed upon them by the NFA and there has been a thirst among some to gain access to higher powered firearms. Firearm suppliers and manufacturers have also been frustrated by the restriction imposed by the Australian market and have been trying to find ways to create new demands for firearm ownership so they can sell more of their products. One firearm supplier, the company NIOA \u2013 which purports to be Australia\u2019s largest privately owned small arms supplier \u2013 saw the potential for a new lever-action shotgun market. A potential to make money from more than 800,000 category A recreational gun owners across Australia. A strategy successfully utilised by NIOA was to find a way to redesign a category A firearm so that it could have greater firing capacity. To garnish this market, NIOA worked with the Turkish-owned company Adler to design a new lever-action that could hold eight cartridges. The gun was promoted by NIOA as a \u201cgame changer for the Australian market\u201d and more than 7,000 Adlers were pre-ordered. Although a ban has been placed on the eight-shot Adler, a six-shot Adler (five in the magazine and one in the chamber) has not been banned and NIOA currently sells nine different models of Adler A110 to firearms dealers. One new model is called the \u201cPunisher\u201d which has a side saddle that holds six extra cartridges. The six-shot is now available to all category A firearm licence holders across Australia. Beside it being a new modern lever-action, what sets this particular Adler lever shotgun apart from other lever-actions is the easy ability to remove the magazine and replace it with one that holders even more ammunition. On 21 July 2015, Chris Dawson, chief executive officer of the Australian Crime Commission prepared a memo warning the minister for justice about this danger concerning the Adler. Dawson warned that with the import of the Adler a new magazine extension market will emerge. He noted that because of the firearm\u2019s tubular magazine feature, the extension of the magazine \u201cis not difficult and requires no specialist gun-smithing skills\u201d. Dawson was not wrong. Since the government allowed the importation of the six-shot Adler in October 2015, a new do-it-yourself magazine extension market has emerged, which allows owners of the Adler A110 to extend the magazine to up to 11 shots. There is no doubt the horse has already bolted as the Adler six-shot flows into this country. There is the possibility that, as I write, one is being converted at home into an 11 shot. It is with great sadness that I watch Australia\u2019s gun laws wilted away under the watchful eyes of both sides of politics. There is a lot that could have been done before now to prevent this situation. But there is still a lot that could be done to prevent the situation from worsening \u2013 ban the eight-shot, recategorise the six-shot to a category C and prohibit the modification of firearm magazines. Prime minister, premiers, police ministers, the ball is in your court.
