But after helping them to serve up a memorable spectacle in such difficult conditions, Harlequins could console themselves with the rediscovery of the moral high ground. Three weeks after their old rivals Wasps had refused to play at Edgeley Park, citing the preposterous possibility of drowning in surface water, Quins had no problem with a pitch that was mostly white at kick\u2011off then deteriorated as the blizzard intensified in the second half \u2013 to such an extent that the referee, George Clancy, twice had to stop the game for the lines to be cleared. \"Full credit to them for fronting up,\" said the Sale director of rugby, Kingsley Jones. \"They came here with the right spirit and we had a game.\" \"Isn't it amazing what you can do when both teams want to play?\" another Sale official muttered meaningfully. Harlequins will be welcomed back for a Premiership game on New Year's Day far more warmly than Wasps whenever they return to the north-west, with any lingering stain to Quins' reputation from the Bloodgate scandal now washed away, in these parts at least. \"Honourably, if you've got people here who have turned up to watch, you've got to make your best efforts to get the game played and finished,\" said the Harlequins head coach, John Kingston, highlighting the contrast with Wasps' attitude, whether deliberately or not. \"I've played in worse than that anyway \u2013 I remember a Varsity Match. The issues were the visibility of the lines, which had to be readdressed a couple of times, and the ground, which was fine because they had the pitch covered. And for 50 minutes there was a lot of good rugby played.\" Cynics may suggest that it was easy for Quins to be so honourable with their chances of progressing in the tournament ended by Sale's win at The Stoop the previous weekend. But they resisted the temptation to rest a raft of players before their two big Premiership fixtures over Christmas and there was nothing half-hearted about the way they responded to the setback of conceding an early try to Sale's No8, Sisa Koyamaibole, after a multi-phase attack expertly orchestrated by Dwayne Peel. First Nick Evans, the fly-half whose selection and attitude epitomised the honesty of Quins' approach, took on the line himself and was rewarded for his courage with a close-range try and then Aston Croall rumbled over from Nick Easter's clean take at the back of a lineout to establish a 14-5 lead. Charlie Hodgson, who had missed with his first two shots at goal, pulled three points back with a penalty in first-half stoppage time, and reduced the deficit to 14-11 with another after his precise pass had sent Ben Cohen charging through the middle. Then in the 55th minute Sale regained the lead when the bulky North Wales sheep farmer Eifion Roberts drove over \u2013 and in the lottery that followed as the full-backs struggled to locate the ball in the blizzard and everyone else began to flounder on Cheshire's newest ice rink, the only real threat Harlequins posed after that was an ambitious long-range drop-goal attempt by Evans that skimmed under the bar. \"I couldn't see what was going on for the last 20 minutes,\" admitted Jones, who reserved special praise for his full-back Nick Macleod with the wings Cohen and Mark Cueto also playing key roles. Sale have now won three of their first four games in the Heineken Cup, a better record than the comparatively star-studded team coached by Jones's predecessor Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 last year, but they probably still need to win in Cardiff to set up a decider when Toulouse make their first trip to Edgeley Park at the end of next month. \"We'd like to order some more snow for that,\" said Jones.
