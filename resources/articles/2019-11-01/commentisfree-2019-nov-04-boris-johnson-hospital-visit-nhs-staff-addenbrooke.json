My final medical exams are fast approaching, and I left the clinic pondering some of the complex conditions I\u2019d just seen. Going up to the prime minister and speaking my mind about the state of the government was not part of my revision plan. Like the majority of people working in Addenbrooke\u2019s, I had no idea Johnson was visiting that day. Most staff didn\u2019t even know he was there until after he had left \u2013 he clearly wanted to get some nice photos in a lab coat and get out of there. As just another young person who is deeply concerned about the future of our planet, as well as our NHS, I decided to try my luck at speaking to Johnson. But the security guard who quickly ushered him away made it very clear I wasn\u2019t allowed to ask questions. Of course politicians\u2019 security must be protected, but what kind of prime minister needs security to protect him from the public\u2019s questions? Only a government whose record is hurt by the facts, led by a man unable to give straight answers. After my attempt to speak to Johnson, some journalists approached me and filmed me talking about the NHS, and the subsequent video was widely shared online and picked up by the national media. I hope that, as a result of my interview, Johnson heeds my call for evidence-based politics, and uses his position of leadership to give us more than just slogans and false promises. As a sixth-year medical student, I might not work in our NHS yet, but I have already seen enough to know why Johnson was so unwilling to meet frontline NHS staff openly. As I\u2019m not yet a doctor, I\u2019m perhaps more able to say things that others might be afraid to, so I want people to hear what other doctors have been saying for years: that the NHS has been relentlessly underfunded by the Conservative government. Medical students like me sit on the periphery of medical care provision, so I see the day-to-day reality of funding shortages. I\u2019ve seen the system stretched in many directions as I\u2019ve trained in different hospitals and departments. Funding \u201cgaps\u201d, as they are often euphemistically labelled, cause increasing delays in patients getting the care they need: your grandmother waiting for her knee operation; or worse, for cancer treatment. There\u2019s never anything truly elective about surgery on the NHS \u2013 patients don\u2019t have surgery for fun \u2013 but \u201celective\u201d operations are increasingly being cancelled. It\u2019s important to recognise the emotional effects of these cancellations: parents being told that the life-saving surgery that was planned for their child today cannot go ahead any more. It\u2019s heartbreaking, and it\u2019s just not good enough. I think patients are perhaps most aware of having to wait longer and longer to see their GPs. Despite the Conservatives\u2019 promises to increase the number of GPs, it keeps falling. In his book Direct Democracy, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt uses the failings of the NHS to push his agenda of fast-forwarding the marketisation of our services. We\u2019ve already seen increasing provision from independent providers, totalling \u00a39.2bn in 2018-19. But there have been serious failings among some of these private companies, notably in the care of vulnerable young people, and also the treatment of adults with autism, learning disabilities and serious mental health problems. This increasing privatisation is also incredibly opaque \u2013 data about levels of private service provision by sector isn\u2019t even collected. If you were an insincere politician, perpetuating the NHS crisis would be a clever way to argue that we couldn\u2019t continue with our current wonderful system, which provides free care for all at the point of use. It\u2019s easier to deconstruct the NHS if you haven\u2019t got anyone to work in it any more; the staffing crisis is such that about one in 12 positions are currently unfilled. If all goes to plan, I will start my first job as a junior doctor next August. While I\u2019m filled with excitement about being able to do the job I\u2019m training for, I also worry that it will be tough. More and more junior doctors are choosing not to continue training after their first two years\u2019 work because of exhaustion and stress \u2013 will this be me in three years? I can\u2019t offer solutions to all the complex issues of our health service. But I can say that we deserve moral integrity and truthful use of evidence by politicians. As a medical student, the work I do is evidence-based, but the government is ignoring the facts. The reality is that the NHS is underfunded and understaffed. Our prime minister doesn\u2019t hold personal responsibility for the entire state of the NHS, but he shouldn\u2019t pretend that hollow promises to build 40 new hospitals (when funding is only confirmed for six) is going to solve the problem. If Johnson really wants to engage with NHS staff, he needs to go beyond photo opportunities, and listen to what people on the ground are saying. Reading the Doctors\u2019 Association\u2019s election priorities \u2013 which include restoring funding and valuing our workforce \u2013 would be a good place to start. After my encounter with Johnson\u2019s team and then with the press, I\u2019m overwhelmed by the positive response I have received for speaking out. But I\u2019m still waiting for answers from the prime minister. \u2022 Julia Simons is a medical student"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
