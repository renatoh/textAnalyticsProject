But 15 years is a record for a national coach, and Hope Powell, who managed England from 1998 until her dismissal on Tuesday, transformed women's football and had some notable successes, the greatest of which was a place in the finals of the Euros in 2011. Crashing out at the group stage in the same contest this year was an inglorious finale to a career distinguished on the field, and marked by guts, determination and \u2013 usually \u2013 loyalty off it. She believed in the long haul, speaking admiringly of the continuity that is such a feature of the successful German side, and working hard to develop young talent. There were mutterings as this summer's Euros progressed from disappointing to dismal, but it was also notable that many of her players spoke strongly in her support. Time for a new broom, maybe, but the groundwork has been done."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
