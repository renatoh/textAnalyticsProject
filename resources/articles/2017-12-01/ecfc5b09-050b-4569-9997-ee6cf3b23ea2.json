How else to explain the sight of Clermont Auvergne thrashing a pallid Saracens in one of the year\u2019s supposedly highest\u2011profile club fixtures in front of a paltry audience on a freezing Monday teatime in Mill Hill? To decree, as the European Professional Club Rugby did in a belatedly rescinded statement on Sunday night, that the rescheduled game would be held behind closed doors was ludicrous from everyone\u2019s point of view \u2013 players, coaches, fans and sponsors. The natural disruption caused by a snowy weekend should not obscure the shambolic administrative aftermath. It would not be a huge surprise to discover that one or two Clermont fans, on hearing the organisers initially announce they would not be allowed into the stadium, hurled their tickets disgustedly into the fire on Sunday night in protest. What a shameful disregard the communique showed for loyal travelling supporters, of which Clermont possess an impressive number. As the clearly motivated Michelin men rampaged to their remarkable victory it was hard not to detect a direct link. With everyone now pointing the finger at someone else it may be a while before precise culpability is apportioned. Some of the language in Clermont\u2019s seething statement may also prove to have been a touch intemperate. Either way, Les Jaunards\u2019 frustration was entirely understandable. Imagine if Saracens had flown to France to play on an artificial pitch in the nation\u2019s capital, with a bad weather forecast widely flagged up. It is fair to assume they would also have wondered aloud about the lack of contingency planning, not least the inability to find an alternative venue when Harlequins could play Ulster \u2013 on grass \u2013 a few anti\u2011clockwise junctions around the M25. Ultimately, of course, it is also rugby\u2019s own fault for failing to declutter its absurdly congested calendar. In any other sport it would be relatively simple to find a spare 80 minutes between now and the end of January; the game could then have been replayed in front of a proper audience with the requisite drum roll. Until the season structure is decongested \u2013 or two-thirds of European pool games are no longer staged in the potentially snowy months of December and January \u2013 the risk of major disruption will remain. To rub a lorry-load of gritting salt into the self-inflicted wound, the supposed after-thought of a game turned out to be a belter. Clermont were frequently imperious, making the defending champions look horribly mortal in the absence of Maro Itoje, Billy Vunipola and Schalk Brits. In the Fijian-born Alivereti Raka they have a matchwinner for all seasons, not to mention a player who hopes to be eligible for France next year having married a Frenchwoman. It also completed the grimmest of full houses in the form of seven defeats out of seven for English clubs in the Champions Cup, making it statistically the worst weekend for the Premiership in the history of Europe\u2019s flagship tournament. Maybe hiding Saracens\u2019 embarrassment away on a dark Monday night with few watching was a smart move after all. There will be no hiding place this weekend, though, when Saracens turn up in Clermont staring down the icy barrel of premature Champions Cup exit. Clearly they don\u2019t like Mondays but an even bleaker Sunday looms. And this time the full yellow army will be in attendance, making a semi-deserted Allianz Park feel positively homely. If ever Mark McCall\u2019s side need a major snowstorm to sweep across the Massif Central and rule out any prospect of rugby until after Christmas now is the moment. \u2019Tis the season to be jolly, but not if you are a Saracens fan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
