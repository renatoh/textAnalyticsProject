Sturridge missed Liverpool\u2019s lamentable 3-1 defeat at Leicester City on Monday through illness and was exempt from Klopp\u2019s criticism of the team\u2019s sixth loss in 12 matches in all competitions this year. \u201cWe all play for our future, myself included,\u201d the Liverpool manager said at the King Power Stadium. Sturridge\u2019s long-term prospects appear bleak, having become an increasingly peripheral figure at Anfield. He has started just five Premier League matches this season \u2013 and nine games in total \u2013 with Klopp favouring a front three of Sadio Man\u00e9, Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho. The England international, 27, has just over two years remaining on the heavily incentivised five-year contract he signed in October 2014 and Klopp, while a firm admirer of the player\u2019s talent, admits the future of Sturridge will be up for discussion once the campaign ends. \u201cI have no idea what happens in the summer,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cIt is not only Daniel but a lot of players. Daniel was not in training for eight or nine days because of a virus infection. \u201cWe have to bring him back to the best shape possible and then bring this season to an end as successfully as possible. Then we will make decisions and speak about Daniel and any other players about what will happen at the end of the season. A lot of things will influence this and we can speak about it when it is time.\u201d Among others who could leave Liverpool this summer are Lucas Leiva, who is out of contract, Alberto Moreno and Emre Can, who has yet to commit to a new contract and has 16 months remaining on his deal. Sturridge is expected to be available for Arsenal\u2019s visit to Anfield on Saturday, when Dejan Lovren should also return having missed Liverpool\u2019s past three matches with a knee problem. Jordan Henderson\u2019s prospects of featuring in a game with major implications for Champions League qualification, however, are remote after Klopp admitted the midfielder was unlikely to have recovered from a foot injury. \u201cIt looks like he will not be ready for Arsenal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will see.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
