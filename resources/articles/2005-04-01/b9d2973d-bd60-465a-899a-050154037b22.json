Rubicon Retail, which owns the Shoe Studio, Principles and Warehouse, and the Mosaic Group, which controls Oasis and Karen Millen, are both considering listing in Iceland. According to fashion weekly Drapers the two companies and their Icelandic backers, Baugur and Kaupthing bank, are talking to advisers about the option of floating one or both of the companies on ICEX, the Icelandic stock exchange. ICEX is home to about 30 companies, including Baugur and Bakkavor, which acquired UK food group Geest. According to Drapers, Rubicon boss Don McCarthy is planning to float this summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
