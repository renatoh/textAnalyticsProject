India are implacably opposed to Denness' presence on the five-man panel, the composition of which the International Cricket Council is due to reveal early next month, and they successfully rallied resistance to his appointment at a meeting of the Asian Cricket Council in Sharjah at the weekend. The England and Wales Cricket Board is increasingly torn between the wish to show loyalty towards Denness, a former England captain who became embroiled inadvertently in a controversy that threatened to split the game, and proposing a compromise candidate who has a far better chance of gaining election to one of the most influential positions in the game. Denness infuriated India by punishing six of their players during a Test series in South Africa last year for offences ranging from undue appealing to suspected ball-tampering. He was castigated in India as \"Denness The Menace\" as a heated stand-off between India and the ICC threatened the survival of England's Test series in India last year. Jagmohan Dalmiya, chairman of the Indian board, and self-styled protector of Indian nationalism, has adopted the Denness issue to challenge the ICC's desire to hand over day-to-day power for the running of the game from elected delegates to full-time administrators. He emerged triumphant from the Asian Cricket Council meeting when he persuaded delegates to pronounce invalid an ICC investigation, scheduled for February 23 in South Africa, into the sentences handed out by Denness during the second Test. Dalmiya also successfully forced an Asian Cricket Council resolution which expressed \"deep concern over the dispute between the ICC and some of its member countries\" and suggested that the region's sentiments were \"not being respected\". India opposes the composition of the ICC three-man panel, comprising Justice P Sachs of South Africa, Andrew Hilditch of Australia and Majid Khan of Pakistan. Basically Dalmiya suspects a fix and would prefer to fix things for himself - by restating delegates' power at an ICC executive board meeting in Cape Town next month. For Denness to be nominated as a match referee by the ECB in such a hostile atmosphere would further illustrate England's privately held belief that Dalmiya represents a threat to the unity of international cricket and must not be appeased at any cost. That sentiment might well be shared by Mal Speed, the one-time Melbourne lawyer, and ICC chief executive, who in his attempts to bring Dalmiya to heel has become Dalmiya's chief b\u00eate noire and offended Indian pride in the process. But Speed is only one member of the three-man ICC panel that must decide the make-up of the elite match-referees' panel, which is due to take effect in April. Sunil Gavaskar, the former Indian batsman, is bound to side with Dalmiya. That leaves Ranjan Madugalle, the Sri Lankan who, as the ICC's respected chief match referee, has been gaining nominations for the elite panel from the Test-playing countries. Sri Lanka's tacit support for Dalmiya at the Sharjah meeting makes it likely that Madugalle will oppose Denness' nomination in an attempt to keep the peace. The ECB is left with the growing recognition that its professions of loyalty, however worthy it might regard them, will be doomed to failure. \u00b7 ThePakistan pace bowler Shoaib Akhtar has called on Glamorgan , still without an overseas player for the new season, to sign him. \"I would love to play for Glamorgan,\" said the 26-year-old. \"I want to play county cricket because I believe it would be a very important experience for me. I believe it would help me improve further as a player.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
