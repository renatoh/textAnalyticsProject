Ferguson, who was sent to the stands during the game, faces two separate counts, one relating generally to alleged \"improper conduct\" and the other specifically to claims that he used abusive language to the match officials. The Manchester United boss, who can request a personal hearing, faces either a touchline ban or a heavy fine if found guilty of misconduct. Ferguson's previous good conduct will be taken into account although the FA commission would take a dim view if it is proved that Ferguson labelled any of the officials as \"cheats\" when he contested the decision not to penalise Andy O'Brien for bringing down Ryan Giggs. In a statement, the governing body announced on their website, www.theFA.com: \"The FA have today charged Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson with misconduct for breaches of FA Rule E1 and E2. \"The charges relate to the alleged use of abusive and/or insulting language to a match official during the match between Newcastle and Manchester United on August 23. He has 14 days to respond.\" While Newcastle boss Sir Bobby Robson admitted Newcastle \"had a bit of luck with Andy O'Brien\", Ferguson was fuming at Rennie's decision. He said afterwards: \"I am aware that the fourth official has been given stricter guidelines this season. I suppose I will have to curb my behaviour in the future. \"I was really angry about the failure to penalise or red-card Andy O'Brien for the foul on Ryan Giggs and made my feelings known from the bench in a way that I have done many times in the past. \"It was a blatant decision and you expect those sort of decisions to be given. I showed my anger to the fourth official. That was why I was sent off.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
