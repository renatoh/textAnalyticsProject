The Bondi-to-Manly is a new 80km coastal walk that links two of Australia\u2019s favourite beaches and takes in Sydney\u2019s iconic landmarks. About 60km of it is on public land, with the rest on suburban footpaths. Finding your way is easy \u2013 cross two bridges and keep the ocean on your right and you should eventually make it to Manly. You can pack a lunch or eat at any of the fine cafes and restaurants along the way. And be sure to wear sunscreen. What is a hyperlapse? A hyperlapse is a timelapse but with the added element of motion. OK, so what is a timelapse? Timelapse is a photographic technique by which the capture rate of a sequence of frames is much slower than the speed in which they are played back. Basically, you\u2019re manipulating time to show \u2013 in only a few seconds \u2013 events that may take several minutes, days or even weeks. Adding movement to the camera is the next step in the process, turning a stationary timelapse into the aforementioned hyperlapse. Now we are not only speeding up time, we\u2019re also changing the point of view. This makes for a more dynamic and interesting shot. Got it. How did you make this \u2026 hyperlapse? The hyperlapse is part of a larger project that profiles the Bondi-to-Manly hike and it was created out of necessity. Because I was filming the entire 80km in a single shot as a piece of interactive slow TV, I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop and set up nice-looking shots to make a promo video. The answer to the problem of not being about to stop lay at the bleeding edge of (budget) camera technology \u2013 I decided to take a 360\u00ba camera with me. Traditionally you view 360\u00ba footage with a pair of goggles but, by using a process known as \u201covercapture\u201d, it\u2019s possible to pull a stabilised shot from the footage in post-production. It\u2019s quite a revolutionary concept when you think about it, especially for newsrooms \u2013 imagine being able to send a reporter to an unpredictable event like a protest or a war zone with one of these cameras. Simply by pressing record, they would be able to capture every bit of action within view. But enough about this (before I talk myself out of a job) \u2026 My plan was to film the entire walk using a small gimbal for the slow TV interactive, and then also shoot the \u201chighlights\u201d with a 360\u00ba camera mounted on a pole sticking out of my backpack. A pole sticking out of your backpack? You must have looked ridiculous. This is true. Holding a tiny camera out in front of me for hours on end, with another tiny camera stuck on a pole sprouting from my backpack \u2026 I looked like a budget version of Google Maps Street View. I got a lot of funny looks but greeted everyone I came across with a smile and \u201cg\u2019day\u201d and I didn\u2019t have any problems. Looks great, was it fun to make? Yes and no. Yes, in that I still can\u2019t believe I managed to convince the news desk to let me go hiking for four days on the company dollar. I did set off from Bondi in the middle of a heatwave in temperatures hovering between 32C and 37C \u2026 so that wasn\u2019t ideal. But overall, it was far better to be out there sweating buckets than being stuck in the office. Once the trek was over, though, the sad truth is I spent almost two months on and off hunched over a computer screen editing \u2013 more time by far than I spent walking from Bondi to Manly! My first attempt at the hyperlapse gave my editor motion sickness \u2013 not the result I was hoping for. The 360\u00ba camera\u2019s editing software was still in beta and couldn\u2019t do what I needed it to, so I had to develop my own painstaking, RSI-inducing workflow \u2013 a seemingly endless cycle of stabilising, animating, blurring and colour correcting. I would set exports up overnight and check the results in the morning. If there was a mistake I\u2019d have to re-export the files the next day. Sound design was also a huge part of the video: I encourage people to watch it wearing a good pair of headphones. There are more than 130 sound effects packed into the video, dialled in and tweaked to perfection by Guardian Australia\u2019s podcast producer, Miles Martignoni."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
