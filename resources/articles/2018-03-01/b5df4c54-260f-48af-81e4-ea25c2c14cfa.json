They claim the order is \u201cimpossible\u201d to fulfil because so many hospitals are struggling to fill medical rotas because of widespread shortages of doctors, which are as high as 25% in some places. The instruction came earlier this month in a letter to the chief executives and medical directors of hospitals in England from the regulators NHS England and NHS Improvement. It made clear that in a bid to cut the number of patients using beds unnecessarily, hospitals must \u201censure every patient has a review at the start and end of the day by a senior clinician to facilitate discharge\u201d. \u201cThis is totally ridiculous \u2013 another example of hospitals being asked to do the impossible by the unreasonable,\u201d one NHS trust chief executive, who asked not to be named, told the Observer. Another warned that getting doctors to review all patients twice daily would leave them with too few medics to staff operations and lead to longer waits for non-urgent procedures. \u201cIt is not doable. It\u2019s another pie in the sky. There just isn\u2019t the clinical workforce to do this without affecting other services and pushing out waiting times which we are also required to meet. Just another request for the impossible,\u201d the chief executive said. The letter, sent on 9 March, also tells hospitals to ensure that they \u201cboost essential services such as diagnostics and pharmacy at the weekends to maximise non-elective patient flow\u201d. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, urged NHS chiefs to \u201cnot to pretend\u201d that hospitals, which have come under unprecedented strain in recent weeks, could do everything they wanted to improve patient care. \u201cThere is simply not enough capacity to deliver optimum care all the time, particularly when demand is as high as it currently is. We should not pretend otherwise,\u201d she said. \u201cRequirements cannot be consistently delivered all the time, particularly when some trusts are running medical vacancy rates of 25%.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
