The challenger bank has been working to repair its reputation following its IT meltdown last year but is looking for around \u00a3100m in cost savings, with its 544-strong branch network under scrutiny. Mark Brown, the general secretary for the Affinity trade union said the lender is likely to unveil up to 100 branch closures when it unveils its new strategy on 25 November. Affinity, while not officially recognised by TSB, represents around 3,900 of its 7,795 staff. Most of the branches in question are likely to employ just a handful of workers, and Brown estimated that around 400 may be affected by the moves. TSB in the past has tried to redeploy staff when possible. Branch closures are a common occurrence in high street banking and more than a third of the UK\u2019s bank branches have shut for good in less than five years, with more than 3,000 closures since 2015. TSB\u2019s parent company, Spanish lender Sabadell, appointed Debbie Crosbie as TSB chief executive last year following an IT failure which locked millions of customers out of their accounts and led to the departure of Crosbie\u2019s predeccesor, Paul Pester. Brown said: \u201cThe results of TSB\u2019s strategic review are going to be more branch closures and more job losses right across the bank. Hundreds of staff who saved TSB following its IT meltdown last year are going to be sacrificed on the altars of costs, efficiency and technology. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Ms Crosbie was brought in by Sabadell to cut costs, increase income and sort out the IT system before TSB is sold to the highest bidder in a few years time.\u201d Many of the closures are expected to come from the 94 branches which are now operating under reduced hours, or are only open once or twice a week following controversial changes introduced over the summer. The remaining closures may come from the network of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society branches which were originally slated for the axe by Lloyds \u2013 the former owner of TSB \u2013 as early as 2009. TSB\u2019s new chief operation officer Suresh Viswanathan told staff last month that the lender spends around \u00a3180m each year on operating costs such as IT systems and staff. In a transcript seen by the Guardian, the executive suggested that the number should be nearly \u00a3100m lower. Ged Nichols, general secretary for TSB\u2019s official union Accord, would not comment on the figures around job cuts or branch closures, but said: \u201cIf TSB is going to overcome its challenge that has implications for partners in the business and we would want and expect the bank to be true to its values and culture and do things in the right way in consultation with the unions.\u201d A TSB spokeswoman said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on speculation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
