The latest attack involves the promotional campaign for The Time Traveler's Wife, the big-screen adaptation of Audrey Niffenegger's novel of the same name. Your eyes do not deceive you: they have indeed spelled it Traveler, as opposed to Traveller. This is not the first time that the spelling of a Hollywood film title has been retained for UK audiences \u2013 some of you may recall that in 1986, Martin Scorsese released The Color of Money. This was followed in 1989 by Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors and Neil LaBute's Your Friends and Neighbors in 1998. Others may take issue with 2001's Pearl Harbor. \"It was the same with Journey to the Center of the Earth, which came out last year. It's because that's on all the artwork. We always just keep that, so anything that's got an American spelling stays,\" says an unrepentant spokesman for the distributors of The Time Traveler's Wife."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
