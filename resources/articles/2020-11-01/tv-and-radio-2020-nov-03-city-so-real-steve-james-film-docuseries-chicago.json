The series pinballs in between the city\u2019s 77 neighborhoods, collaging a tale of disparate economic fortunes, a city riven by decades of segregation, lurching forward and back. In one scene in the first episode, film-maker Steve James, whose work includes Hoop Dreams and America To Me, drops in on a black barbershop on the city\u2019s South Side with his crew. The barber and another customer, still in his US Postal Service uniform argue about black male privilege, their views on personal responsibility within systemic racism. The postal worker reveals he works in human resources \u2013 \u201cso you\u2019re the one who\u2019s stopping me from getting a job because I\u2019ve got a felony?\u201d the barber retorts. Cut to: a barbershop in Bridgeport, still South Side, all white men, joking of donuts and health problems. They, too, believe the \u201csystem sucks\u201d, but because \u201claws are out here to protect these idiots on the street\u201d, one ex-cop says. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke.\u201d City So Real then jumps to footage from the trial of Jason Van Dyke, the former Chicago police officer who shot Laquan McDonald, a 17-year-old black teenager whose 2014 killing sparked a national referendum on police reform. In this sequencing, City So Real traverses the chasms of race, class, age and political engagement from resident to resident, restaurant to restaurant, neighborhood to neighborhood. The series, filmed from late 2018 through the summer of 2020, loosely courses along two concurrent backbones: the tightly contested mayoral race between 14 candidates, and the trial and sentencing of Van Dyke, four years after the cover-up and eventual release of dash-cam footage scandalized Mayor Rahm Emanuel and exacerbated tensions between majority-black neighborhoods and the mostly white force who police them. The series is not meant to \u201cbe a love letter to Chicago\u201d, James, a longtime Chicago resident himself, told the Guardian. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want it to be a diatribe against Chicago either.\u201d Instead, City So Real paints a long-form, embedded portrait of a chameleonic city with decades of baggage \u2013 the legacy of rampant neighborhood segregation, reputation and reality of gun violence, a tradition of backroom dealing. The film crew \u201cset out to get that sense of what Chicago means to the people and the everyday people within the city, and not just the opinion leader types and politicians\u201d, said James. To do so \u2013 to get a cross-section of the city that could include an all-white watch party for mayoral candidate Garry Peters and voter canvassing at black churches \u2013 James worked with a diverse team of co-collaborators, some black and from Chicago. James, a white film-maker, is no stranger to sensitive, complicated, tense racial and socioeconomic fault lines in Chicago: for Hoop Dreams, he followed two black teenagers as they chased basketball careers at majority-white high school. In the 10-part series America to Me, James spent a year embedded in the fraught microcosm of American diversity known as Oak Park River Forest high, in the west Chicago neighborhood where he lives. \u201cI\u2019ve generally not had a hard time in my view, getting people to open up to me and speak to me,\u201d James said of working in mostly black or diverse spaces. \u201cBut I think one thing that is true is that even though people may be opening up and being candid, they are speaking to me as a white person that they want to communicate to me about something.\u201d At the black barbershop, for example, \u201cmy identity is inescapable,\u201d said James. Filming for that scene was instead led by America to Me cinematographer Kevin Shaw, an African American man, while James faded into the background. \u201cI think because of the makeup of the crew on that particular day,\u201d he said, \u201cit really kind of gave the guys permission to have a conversation that was not something they thought I as a white film-maker had an interest in or cared about. \u201cThis is one of the reasons why the diversity on the film crew is so vitally important. It\u2019s not just for equity reasons. It\u2019s also because you will get different experiences captured.\u201d Chicago has, on a surface level, coasted ahead as a globalized metropolis, with shiny skyscrapers downtown and an influx of wealth; according to census data, almost one-quarter of city households made over $100,000 in 2016. But much of that prosperity has not flowed to the city\u2019s poorer, majority-black neighborhoods, where new jobs have not replaced the flight of industrial manufacturing in the late 20th century. An entrenched cycle of segregation, disparate wealth and health outcomes has led to an exodus of black residents from the city: from 2000-2010, Chicago lost 181,000 black residents, many of them middle-class families who could afford to move. Though it remains one of the most segregated by race in the nation, City So Real visits an array of neighborhoods beyond the what James called the \u201cold hat\u201d \u201ctale of two cities\u201d black/white divide. There\u2019s Chinatown, where a restaurant owner recalled the racist prank calls as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and Devon Avenue\u2019s \u201cLittle India\u201d, where mayoral candidate Toni Preckwinkle attended a Sikh ceremony. But the series also bores into the minutiae of local government politics, specifically the 2019 mayoral contest, when 14 candidates vied for votes \u2013 in door-to-door canvassing, in forums, in questionable downstairs pseudo-court hearings on the legality of opponents\u2019 required signatures \u2013 in the dead of winter. James\u2019s team captures an array of candidates, some fresh-faced, some well-established, embarking on Chicago\u2019s famed hard-ball politics. Lori Lightfoot ultimately won the race in a landslide run-off election, becoming the city\u2019s first black female and LGBTQ mayor; the series\u2019 final episode checks in on her tenure, as her handling of the coronavirus pandemic and widespread protests after the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police receive mixed, sometimes hostile reviews \u2013 too far on the lockdowns, for some, empty reform promises for many leading the protests. The series also addresses, but does not foreground, Chicago\u2019s reputation as the poster child for urban violence. Trump recycled a longstanding conservative image of Chicago as the center of \u201cblack-on-black\u201d crime, a racial trope often used by politicians and the NRA to scare white suburbanites, when he sent federal officers to the city this summer as part of his \u201claw and order\u201d response to widespread protests against anti-Black police brutality. The stereotype of Chicago as lawless, dangerous \u201cChiraq\u201d is \u201cunfortunate\u201d, James said, \u201cbecause that is a misrepresentation of the city on one hand; on the other hand, we do have a very serious issue of violence, but we\u2019re not the only city that\u2019s dealing with that. \u201cI was very conscious in this series that I didn\u2019t want to spend an inordinate amount of time covering that aspect of Chicago because it is what everybody focuses on outside of Chicago,\u201d James said. Some residents, black and white, express frustration with gun violence, and skepticism of all the politicians before who promised change and never delivered. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to ignore it,\u201d said James, \u201cbut at the same time I wanted to show that Chicago has so much more to it than just that image.\u201d The hope, James said, is for audiences to \u201csee Chicago as this incredibly complex, inspiring, at times infuriating, passionate place, and that the people who live here embody all those qualities as well\u201d. City So Real is available on the National Geographic channel and Hulu in the US with a UK date to be announced"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
