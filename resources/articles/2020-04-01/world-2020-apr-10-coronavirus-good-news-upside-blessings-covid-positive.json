Like all the best epigrams, it is deeply wise, even if it overgeneralises. I can\u2019t think of many instances from my own life where it isn\u2019t true. A breakdown, a miscarriage, a job lost \u2013 they all led to better things. The phrase reminds me of something Winston Churchill supposedly said on losing the 1945 election. His wife apparently told him that defeat may well have been a blessing in disguise. \u201cMadame, if this is a blessing, it is indeed well disguised,\u201d he replied. And yet a blessing it was. Britain got Attlee, the welfare state, the NHS. Churchill got a rest, and then his swansong six years later. The rest is history. And so to the present. Though our current blessings may also be well disguised, we must count them. I have just listened to a fine podcast on this, an interview with Mo Gawdat, who has expressed some of the most sensible, positive, beautiful sentiments about the crisis that I have yet heard. If you click on one link this week, let is be this: an hour of your life that will make you feel better. There were other Upside blessings this week, including: \u2022 Food heroes reaching out to the vulnerable. Two-minute read \u2022 Drive-by Strauss: concerts aired from cars. One-minute blast \u2022 The pandas finally securing enough privacy to mate. About 10 minutes \u2022 Two penpals: one is five, the other 93. Two minutes \u2022 How universities are doing their bit. 90 seconds \u2022 The billionaires piling into the coronavirus relief effort. Two minutes \u2022 The politicians returning to medical careers to help in the Covid effort. Two minutes \u2022 What the virus teaches us about hope.

Extended browse \u2022 The colour of spring, in all its glory. Two-minute balm \u2022 Breathing new life into the Great Barrier Reef. One-minute, nice pics \u2022 The rise and rise of the microloan. Three-minute loan, low rate of interest \u2022 The enzymes that eat plastic. One minute Lucky numbers Back on Covid-19, there are tentative signs of infection curves flattening. Do watch for this tendency \u2013 not the rising death rates \u2013 as an early harbinger of the turning point. Also, this is an interesting attempt to map how Americans have responded to lockdown. Meanwhile, this was rather hopeful: almost three-quarters of new electricity generation capacity built in 2019 involved renewable energy. What we liked We admire the Atlantic, and are very much looking forward to its new column How to Build a Life by Arthur C Brooks. It certainly got off to a good start. We also respected the way the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, congratulated his opposite number on being reappointed to the shadow cabinet. Elsewhere, this is striking: a ferry \u2013 powered by waves, courtesy of Mongabay. What we heard Upside readers, yo are amazing \u2013 resilient, imaginative, supportive and creative. We love receiving your messages about how you are coping in lockdown. Keep them coming. Karen Ranney wrote in from Kingston, New York. My mother, Lorraine Ranney (11 Oct 1919 \u2013 17 Sep 2019), lived her 100 years always seeking to serve and help others. In her memory and honor, I granted some thousands of dollars of the inheritance I recently came into towards the transition to face mask production at foundmyanimal.com. Bethany Obrecht and I have never had a conversation less than 15 feet from each other, but we are friends for life. Just last week, her workshop at foundmyanimal.com assembled more than 2,000 masks. I have always said my parents were the Great Generation, and now it is our turn to attempt to fill their shoes. Lorna Robson wants to get us all into bridge. We were forced to shut our bridge business (Andrew Robson Bridge Club) three weeks ago when social distancing started, as all of our bridge teaching and bridge playing was face to face. Last week we started a new little venture online called Andrew Robson BridgeCasts, a sort of cross between a podcast and a video. We started it thinking we\u2019d be lucky to get 100 subscribers, but a week later, we have 2,600. The first few days are free, then it is paid for, but just under \u00a310 a month (about 30p a day). We are amazed at the feedback we have been getting and how people are joining our online bridge community. Finally, Bhavika got in touch from west London. I wanted to share a clip from my block of flats in Sudbury Hill, west London. One of the residents, Chrissy, a zumba teacher, led a zumba class for everyone. It was fantastic! It really helped lift people\u2019s spirits and it showed how important community is. Everyone was joining in, from toddlers to old people! Where was the Upside? In a charity poster that my super talented colleague Chris Clarke has created for NHS charities. Get yours here. Thank you for all your messages. Keep them coming. Also, do send any suggestions for where else to look for the Upside. In the meantime, we wish you a serene weekend and fortitude for the next phase. Bon courage! \u2022 This article was amended on 9 June 2020 to make clear in the main image caption that the poster artwork depicted was designed by Mark Titchner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
