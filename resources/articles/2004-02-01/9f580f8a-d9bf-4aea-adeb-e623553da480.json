After all it was only last season that several dozed off when Howard Wilkinson attempted to illustrate the importance of teamwork by showing a film of geese flying in formation. Rather less enamoured with psychology than his predecessor, Mick McCarthy nevertheless played his side the tape of Sunderland's 1973 Cup triumph over Leeds on Saturday lunchtime. \"As a player it wouldn't have affected my performance. It wouldn't have made a blind bit of difference,\" said McCarthy. \"But maybe it helped my team, maybe it showed what can be possible.\" Bob Stokoe's side were struggling in the old Second Division before embarking on that Wembley run; McCarthy's men exited the Premiership - coincidentally at Birmingham - only last spring. Kevin Kyle, Sunderland's centre-forward and a striker stylistically so early 20th century that he makes the abrasive Vic Halom, his 1973 equivalent, appear subtle, believes that earning a fifth-round replay proves their readiness to return to the elite. \"We passed the ball like a Premiership side - at times we were excellent,\" said the scorer of Sunderland's equaliser. Though Kyle's goal, a glancing near-post header after Marcus Stewart's left-wing cross, was thoroughly deserved, his prognosis may be a trifle optimistic. True, in Julio Arca, Sunderland boasted the best player on view and their passing has improved significantly, but the left-winger is the sole outstanding player in a determined team who disguise numerous technical flaws well. Steve Bruce's Birmingham may be blessed with a greater natural talent but they camouflaged it well in the rain. If he shrugged off persistent chants of \"fat Geordie bastard\", saying \"that's what you expect here if you're a Newcastle supporter\", he was dismayed by this display. \"Five or six players were well below their best,\" said Bruce, who must have thought a replay would be unnecessary when Mikael Forsell wriggled into the area before beating Mart Poom with an adroit right-foot shot. Bruce has so far failed to persuade Forsell, on loan from Chelsea, to promise to sign a long-term deal in the summer but Robbie Savage has been demanding a new contract. Birmingham say they will offer the midfielder a three- or four-year extension to his present deal, which expires next year. Here Savage was occupied with his rough treatment by Jason McAteer and Jeff Whitley. In the 81st minute Bruce replaced Savage with Aliou Ciss\u00e9. Nine minutes later Ciss\u00e9 was sent off for his second bookable offence, a nasty tackle on Arca. \"I don't know what's been going on with Ciss\u00e9 at the African Nations but he was, er, up for it,\" Bruce admitted. Kyle played on a sea of Stokoe-inspired sentiment. \"I saw an item about Bob Stokoe on Football Focus and it moved me,\" said Kyle. \"Then, seeing clips from '73 on the bus here lifted me. I know I was more up for this game after watching those highlights.\" Man of the match: Julio Arca (Sunderland)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
