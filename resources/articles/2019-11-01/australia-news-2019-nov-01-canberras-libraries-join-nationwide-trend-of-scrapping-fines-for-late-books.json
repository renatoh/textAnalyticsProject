The Australian Capital Territory government announced on Thursday that it would no longer charge fines, and would forgive all existing ones, from 21 November. Instead, those with an overdue book will have their borrowing and computer use suspended until it is returned. Parts of Sydney, Victoria and the entire state of Tasmania are among other Australian localities to completely abolish fines. In 2017, the City of Sydney announced it would waive fines for four years, after a 12-month trial showed that three times the number of overdue books were returned. In 2018, Tasmania became the first state to completely abolish fines, which resulted in 8,000 new members over the next year. In Victoria, the Yarra Plenty library system, which covers nine libraries, removed fines this year, and the City of Port Phillip has not had them for a decade. In the ACT, more then 24,000 residents currently have a library debt, adding up to $1.8m. The territory is moving its library records to a new computer system on 21 November and decided it was the right time to make the change. Under the new system, borrowers may still have to pay a fine to replace a lost book. Books can be deemed lost if they are overdue for four weeks. Chris Steel, the ACT\u2019s city services minister, said the response to the move had been \u201chugely positive\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve been quite overwhelmed by the response,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThis is a trend around the world because it makes sense. It\u2019s a win-win.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Steel said that the move would remove barriers to access to libraries, especially among low-income families. \u201cWe know that a majority of people who have library fines never come back and use our libraries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to try and address the issue, the barrier that stopped people. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen from other cities \u2013 around the world and also around Australia \u2013 that when library fines were abolished there was an increase in membership. In New York there was a 10% increase in children returning to libraries. That\u2019s the cohort we want, as well as low-income families. \u201cFamilies have been commenting on social media saying this is actually a cost of living issue. Particularly when they have a couple of kids who are borrowing quite a few items, and they are not as organised as they would like to be. They have accrued quite a debt.\u201d He also added that effectively fines were abolished as of Thursday. \u201cWe won\u2019t be charging any new fines,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not the first and we hope other cities will take up this measure.\u201d The largest fine ever paid to ACT libraries was $700. Borrowers who currently have overdue items can either return or renew them. Items can only be renewed up to five times, unless they have already been reserved. However, if borrowers have already paid late fines or lost book fines, these cannot be refunded. People who have paid for a lost item, but then found it, can keep the item."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
