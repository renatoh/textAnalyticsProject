Mirren, who co-starred with Brand in a poorly received remake of the film Arthur released earlier this year, said he was \"kind, he's got a great heart and he's incredibly smart\". Brand quit his Radio 2 show in late 2008 after broadcasting lewd voicemail messages that he and Jonathan Ross had left for Sachs. The resulting scandal, stoked by the media, also led to Ross being suspended without pay for three months by the BBC. \"It really made me cross because that's what comedians are for and that's what makes them so valuable to us. Sometimes they step over the line but if they didn't do that they wouldn't be of the value that they are,\" Mirren told the latest issue of the Radio Times, published on Tuesday. \"[Brand's] brain is fast and brilliant and I hate it when they try to pull these people down. Being naughty \u2013 and it was schoolboy kind of behaviour \u2013 is one thing but there came a point where it was 'OK, can we please move on?',\" she added. Mirren, who stars in new film The Debt, to be released in UK cinemas later this month, also described the riots that erupted in London and other English cities in August as \"terrifying\". \"There was a rush of crazed adrenaline and everyone, including the media, got caught up in it. We're a funny, complicated country, Britain, there's a streak of savagery and this was like cannibalism, society eating itself in a way,\" added Mirren, who splits her time between the UK and California. Before the appointment of Bernard Hogan-Howe as the new Metropolitan police commissioner earlier this month, London mayor Boris Johnson is reported to have said he would like the job to go to a \"Jane Tennison\" figure. This is a reference to the role Mirren is most closely associated with \u2013 the tough, no-nonsense detective inspector in long-running ITV drama Prime Suspect. \"The Met have a Jane Tennison figure. They've got Sue Akers,\" Mirren said, referring to the deputy assistant commissioner who is heading Scotland Yard's phone-hacking investigation, Operation Weeting. \"And what they need are more of them \u2013 black Jane Tennisons and Asian Jane Tennisons.\" Mirren spent time with Akers when researching her Prime Suspect role. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
