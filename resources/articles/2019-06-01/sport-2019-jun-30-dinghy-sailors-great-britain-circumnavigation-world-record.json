Will Hodshon, 42, and Rich Mitchell, 44, will have spent 16 days at sea when they arrive back in Devon early on Monday onboard a Wayfarer dinghy that is a mere 4.9 metres (16ft) long. Once they have stretched their legs and had showers and a few square meals, the lifelong friends will apply to Guinness World Records to go into the history books as the first to complete the feat, which requires a combination of brilliant sailing ability and a daredevil attitude. Mitchell said they had had some wonderful days. \u201cThere have been moments when we\u2019ve had perfect sailing conditions. We\u2019ve seen minke whales, hundreds of seals and dolphins have accompanied us for hours at a time trying to splash us.\u201d But there have also been some scary moments, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few days of big winds and waves and in those conditions you can\u2019t sleep at all. Will has been hearing the odd voice or two and I\u2019ve been hallucinating a bit. Sleep deprivation has been the worst \u2013 we\u2019ve fallen asleep on watch a number of times. Sometimes the sailing is very challenging. You can\u2019t get off the boat when you feel you\u2019ve had enough. You just have to carry on with it.\u201d The British-designed Wayfarer is a popular family day-boat, though its seaworthiness means that it can be relied upon in open waters. However, it is not a simple vessel to sail, staying upright thanks to a combination of careful distribution of the crew\u2019s bodyweight and constant trimming or adjustment of the sails. The Wayfarer Hodshon and Mitchell have voyaged in, Nipegegi \u2013 pronounced nippy gee-gee \u2013 is built of mahogany and is 60 years old. It was bought at the 1959 London Boat Show by Hodshon\u2019s grandfather, Bill Hodshon. Its name is made up of the first two letters of the names of the adventurer\u2019s uncle, father and two aunts: Nick, Penny, Geoff and Gill. Hodshon, a marine geoscientist from Wiltshire, said: \u201cThree times we\u2019ve been in near gale-force or gale-force winds. When that happens at night it\u2019s really scary. In the North Sea when we were at our furthest point out \u2013 about 60 miles \u2013 we had already been going hard into the wind for a day and a half. We were wet and cold already. This wind came in, we were worried, I didn\u2019t know how we were going to make it. We took it an hour at a time and eventually got through.\u201d The pair were inspired by another circumnavigation of Great Britain in 2014 when the sailors Jeremy Warren and Phil Kirk ventured around the coast in just over a month. But they stopped, which Hodshon and Mitchell decided not to. \u201cWe haven\u2019t touched dry land at all,\u201d said Mitchell, a fisheries expert from Fort William in the Scottish Highlands. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it and hankered after it \u2013 and the odd pub we\u2019ve passed.\u201d One of his favourite legs was the North Sea. \u201cI\u2019ve known it as a brown and cold and miserable and cold place,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one of the days there was a beautiful, sunny day. The sea was like glass, not a ripple. That changed my whole perception of what the North Sea is.\u201d Hodshon said he preferred sailing through the islands of western Scotland with fantastic views of hills and mountains. But there has been little disagreement onboard. \u201cWe already knew most things about each other but it\u2019s a very small boat,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left to hide from each other. And we didn\u2019t run out of conversation. \u201cPeople think they\u2019d get bored. Each day flies by \u2013 setting the sails, planning the next meal, planning for the toilet break. There\u2019s almost not enough time in the day. We\u2019ve never been bored.\u201d The pair have been raising money for charities including the lifeboat charity the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and Surfers Against Sewage. They took with them enough freeze-dried food to last 30 days so food has not been a problem. \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough to go around again,\u201d said Hodshon. \u201cBut we aren\u2019t going to.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
