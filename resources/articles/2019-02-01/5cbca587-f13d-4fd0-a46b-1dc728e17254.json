Gobert is fourth in the NBA in blocks per game, and fifth in the league in rebounds per game. He\u2019s also shooting a league-high 65% from two-point range this season. Nonetheless, the snub will cost the 26-year-old Frenchman a $1m bonus, according to ESPN\u2019s Bobby Marks. \u201cI feel disrespected,\u201d Gobert told reporters in Salt Lake City. \u201cDisrespectful, not only towards me but towards the team, the organization and towards the game. All the coaches preach about defense. Every day they talk about defense, they talk about how important it is to get stops in order to win basketball games. And when it\u2019s time to vote, they they\u2019re not able to reward the best defensive player in the world.\u201d Gobert was not selected by the league\u2019s coaches as an All-Star reserve; those picks were unveiled Thursday, though the vote totals were not disclosed. He also finished 17th in the weighted rankings for the three Western Conference frontcourt starting spots, which were announced last week. \u201cRudy deserved to be named an All-Star,\u201d Jazz president Steve Starks wrote on Twitter. \u201cComplete non-sense and we need more integrity and accountability. If the coaches vote (then) their ballots should be made public.\u201d The Jazz likely feel they were snubbed twice. Neither Gobert nor standout Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell, who is averaging 22.5 points per game, were picked for the All-Star Game on 17 February in Charlotte. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be focused on those things,\u201d Gobert said. \u201cBut at (some) point, I would like to get some recognition.\u201d In a tweet to his teammate, Mitchell said he and Gobert were \u201crobbed\u201d. Many centers in recent years, including Miami\u2019s Hassan Whiteside and the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 JaVale McGee, have said they feel like the NBA All-Star voting process makes it extremely hard for players at their position to get a fair shot at making the team. The league has a system that has players fall into two categories for All-Star balloting \u2013 backcourt and frontcourt, with nothing specific for the centers. Gobert said he knows offense is easier to market than defense. But he also said that his not making the All-Star team sends a bad message to kids who watch the game as well. \u201cYou\u2019re telling them that defense doesn\u2019t matter, that winning doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Gobert, who spoke for several minutes Friday before emotions overcame him. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s great for the future of the league.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
