I shall treasure this usage. It may of course be just another of those standard folksy formulations that adorn American speech, but I've failed to find any previous trace of it - though I did on the internet find an evangelical text from a tutor in speaking techniques called Melissa Mayers Lewis, who says that when addressing a meeting you should always have porchlights in mind. Try to think of your audience (she counsels) as a collection of porchlights: some are on, and some off. Direct your appeal to the ones that are on, at the same time remembering that the negative faces may not be your fault. People frown when they have a stomach ache; they scowl when they're reliving a fight with their spouses; they drop off when they've spent the night rocking a sick baby. Nine times out of 10, Melissa suggests, they had turned off their porchlights long before you walked in the room. Also, just because a person's porchlight is off, it doesn't mean nobody's home. The person might just be concerned, anxious, or distracted. With a little more information or reassurance, that listener's porchlight might even come on more brightly than all the others. So if porchlights start turning off as this column proceeds I shall put it all down to colic. \u00b7 The other day a columnist in the Times attributed that evocation of England which depends on old maids bicycling to Holy Communion to the one-time Conservative prime minister Stanley Baldwin. Not so: it emanated from a later Conservative premier, John Major, who had found it, or had it found for him, in the writings of Orwell. The Baldwin passage of which the Times man may have been thinking came in a speech in 1924 in which he evoked \"the sounds of England, the tinkle of the hammer on the anvil in the country smithy, the corncrake on a dewy morning, the sound of the scythe against the whetstone, and the sight of a plough team coming over the brow of a hill, the sight that has been seen in England since England was a land, and may be seen in England long after the empire has perished and every works in England has ceased to function - for centuries the one eternal sight of England.\" Baldwin tends now to be remembered, if he's remembered at all, as a boring West Midlands industrialist who led the Tory party through the years of appeasement and handled, more successfully, the abdication of Edward VIII. Yet dull old stick as people sometimes took him to be, he had not, at this stage at least, turned off the porchlight of poetry. It sounds a bit corny today perhaps, yet I doubt if Michael Howard will do as well at Bournemouth this week. \u00b7 After the knock-out success of Notting Hill and the rather less spectacular triumph of Shoreditch we now, I discover, have a movie called Wimbledon, which people here and in the States are flocking in record numbers to see. That is hardly surprising. The heartwarming story of how this fine old institution in London SW19 came out of non-league obscurity to win the FA Cup in 1988 sounded to me from the start like a made-in-Britain theme to rival even Seabiscuit. Even better, it looks like a happy omen for the screenplay on which I am working for a dark and torrid drama called Winchmore Hill. We hope to cast Scarlett Johansson as the chair of the local chamber of commerce, while Robert de Niro is slated to play the mayor. Calixto Bieito may or may not direct. The huge appeal of this new genre, I'm assured by friends in the industry, is attracting other leading directors too. Woody Allen is said to be working on something called Deritend, Claude Lelouch is rumoured to be planning Moss Side, a daffy romantic comedy starring Cliff Richard and Scarlett Johansson, while Patricia Routledge, Penelope Wilton and Scarlett Johansson are signed up, reportedly as we nowadays say, for a David Mamet picture provisionally titled Hunslet. My own secret long-term scheme, if I can raise the finance, is to broaden these horizons even further with Kettering! - an epic tale of the boot and shoe trade starring Morgan Freeman, Robert Hardy and Bruce Willis. \u00b7 And so at last to the matter of mumps. Since I raised the issue of how Burrow Mump in Somerset came to be called a mump rather than say a hump, lump or bump, I've been pelted with appropriate definitions of which the most enjoyable, sent by Derek Seddon, come from a Dictionary of Archaic Words by James Orchard Halliwell, published in 1850. In the north, he says, to mump means to beat or bruise; in the west, to beg, cheat or intrude. More specifically, Gloucestershire people use mump to indicate a large piece of wood, or root, while within the county of Somerset it simply means a lump or protruberance, just as it does in the illness called mumps. Mumpingday, we are further assured, is December 21, when the poor go round the country begging for corn, while mumpoker is an expression used on the Isle of Wight to frighten naughty children, as in: \"I will send the mumpoker after you.\" Meanwhile, after long and painstaking research, Margaret and Chris Chambers (proud parents of the Greg Chambers who has recently, thanks to Smallweed's patronage, established himself as the world's leading expert on the notional outputs of rival aphorists) tell me, rather surprisingly, that the first map reference to Burrow Mump is as recent as 1904, while the first recorded reference in a book came 18 years later. As for Oldham having a station called Mumps, that, I can now say with certainty, is because this site was a gathering place for beggars. \u00b7 Great seers of our time: number one in a Smallweed series of one. \"For Labour, the forthcoming byelection could become the Hartlepool horror\" - Lord Rees-Mogg, the Times, July 26. Yes, that's Labour: I went back and checked. Isn't it time they switched off his porchlight? Or at least sent the mumpoker after him.
