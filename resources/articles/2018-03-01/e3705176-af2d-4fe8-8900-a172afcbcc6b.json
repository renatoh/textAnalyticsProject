The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, wrote to the attorney general, Christian Porter, on Wednesday expressing concern that two months after Labor proposed an anti-corruption commission the Coalition had not agreed to set one up. Porter told Guardian Australia the Coalition was considering \u201cdetailed models\u201d for the reform, including possibly strengthening and combining some existing bodies. He warned Labor against proceeding by \u201cannouncement first and detail second\u201d, saying the Coalition would continue consulting before engaging in public debate. Porter has met a panel of judges and legal experts who are in favour of an anti-corruption body and asked for a briefing on how it could operate fairly without impugning people\u2019s reputations, one of the key concerns inside the Coalition. One of the panel members, the former chairman of Transparency International, Anthony Whealy, told Guardian Australia they responded with a briefing last week that put a \u201cstrong case there is no need for it to operate unfairly\u201d. Whealy said the concern could be addressed by only having public hearings where it is in the public interest, including not unfairly damaging witnesses\u2019 reputation. He said it was \u201calmost impossible\u201d to combine existing bodies which had different functions and instead recommended an anti-corruption body cooperate with existing agencies. After Labor\u2019s announcement in late January, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said he was \u201clooking at this issue\u201d and that he \u201ccertainly\u201d had not ruled it out. But Dreyfus complained that a national integrity commission \u201ccannot wait much longer\u201d and the task of working together to set it up is \u201cever more urgent\u201d. Dreyfus cited the case of the former small business minister, Bruce Billson, who the privileges committee found on Monday had been employed and paid by a business lobby group before he quit parliament in May 2016. On Tuesday the House of Representatives officially censured Billson for taking a $75,000 a year job with the Franchise Council of Australia in March 2016, which the privileges committee found he had failed to declare in breach of his obligations as an MP. \u201cThe cause for Mr Billson\u2019s censure \u2013 failing to declare private sector payments made to him while he was still an MP, paid to him for work he was doing on behalf of a key stakeholder group he had engaged with when he was the minister for small business \u2013 is the kind of behaviour which does serious damage to the Australian public\u2019s faith in our democracy and our politics,\u201d he wrote. Porter told Guardian Australia a parliamentary committee had recommended that \u201ccareful consideration\u201d be given \u201cto establishing a commonwealth agency with broad scope and jurisdiction to address integrity and corruption matters, and that is what we are doing\u201d. \u201cIt may be that the best way to further strengthen and improve the national integrity framework is to consolidate a range of existing bodies into a single commonwealth agency,\u201d he said. Change should \u201cimprove rather than detract from present arrangements\u201d and required detailed consultation on \u201ca variety of options for a new body which can be the subject of public debate\u201d. Porter questioned whether an anti-corruption body would have jurisdiction to consider the case of Sam Dastyari, who resigned after revelations of his links to Chinese donor Huang Xiangmo. The experience of anti-corruption bodies at the state level indicated this was \u201cthe worst possible area in which to engage in policy on the run\u201d, he said. Before his censure, Billson submitted to the privileges committee that his failure to declare the job was an \u201cadministrative error and oversight\u201d and wrote to the Speaker apologising for the \u201cdiscourtesy to the house this represents\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
