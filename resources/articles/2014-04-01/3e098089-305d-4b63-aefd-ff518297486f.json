But financiers seeking redress is hard to take", "bodyText": "Two years ago, Martin Wheatley told insurance and pension companies that his new get-tough Financial Conduct Authority would \"shoot first and ask questions later\". But it's Wheatley who is now dodging bullets, fired by the very industry he set out to reform. One of them may yet be fatal. A quoted company can't selectively release information, say to mates of the chief executive, but must give it to the whole market. It can't spread misinformation. If it sees a false market in its shares, it must act immediately to correct the facts. When the FCA briefed the Daily Telegraph about its proposed inquiry into the pensions industry \u2013 and prompted a \u00a33bn rout of insurance company shares \u2013 the regulator fell foul of one, or arguably all, of these golden rules. If reports are to be believed, some of the City's biggest investors have consulted a leading law firm over the potential for compensation. But that's part of the problem \u2013 \"if reports are to be believed\". The market believed the Telegraph's report, and marked down insurance company shares dramatically. Subsequently there was much speculation about what Clive Adamson, the FCA's director of supervision, did or did not say in his briefing. But questions about the journalistic process, while interesting, are not especially relevant. It doesn't matter whether the story was right or wrong; what mattered was what the FCA did in the immediate aftermath. PRs are experts at \"killing\" stories. The regulator would have been aware, late that Thursday night, that a front-page story was coming. You don't have to be a sleuth to find out \u2013 most newspapers now publish their next-day stories online before midnight, and often hours earlier. Maybe the FCA did, naively, believe when it briefed the Telegraph that the information would not be market-sensitive, but by midnight it should surely have dawned on them. Why, then, did it take so long for the regulator to calm markets with its clarification, issued hours after the stock exchange opened? Now take a further step back. Why was the FCA engaged in briefing just one paper on an announcement of such potentially far-reaching impact? A regulator should be guarded, proportionate and reasoned when communicating something as important as its supervisory strategy for the year ahead. In dishing out exclusives, it turned itself from gamekeeper into poacher. Adamson, already under pressure as the regulator who authorised the appointment of the now-disgraced Paul Flowers to the board of Co-op Bank, may find his position untenable. But in baying for blood, the \"City investors\" seeking legal retribution are guilty of breathtaking hypocrisy. Over the past two decades we have seen billions in compensation paid out for the mis-selling of personal pensions, mortgage endowments and payment protection insurance. How many bank or insurance company chief executives have walked the plank as a result? None. Now the who-said-what-to-whom game has disguised, to the pension industry's delight, the very real problem of the exit charges faced by savers. It's not uncommon in some old-style pension contracts for savers to lose 10% of their cash should they audaciously attempt to move it, which is why so few ever do. The chances of those penalties being removed now appear slim. Will the FCA really face prosecution and multimillion-pound fines like those it has meted out in recent weeks, such as the \u00a312m against Santander only a fortnight ago? Experts believe the immunities enjoyed by regulators will place the bar very high, although a prosecution on grounds of recklessness might possibly see the light of day. And if the industry is seeking revenge, it should be careful what it wishes for. The FCA survives entirely on the annual levy it imposes on its members \u2013 financial firms. If the industry engages in a legal battle against its regulator, the costs will rebound on the companies whatever the result. Heathrow needs a flashier pilot now Rigorous, tightly controlled and rather unexciting, the Heathrow chief executive Colin Matthews embodied in his personal qualities everything that passengers expected of Britain's biggest airport itself. Apart from the 2010 snow fiasco that should have cost him his job, he kept Heathrow out of the headlines and got the airport working again after standards collapsed in the wake of Ferrovial's takeover in 2006. So Matthews will walk away this summer \u2013 having announced his departure last week \u2013 with deserved plaudits, led by the 75% of passengers who now rate the Heathrow experience as good or excellent. But Matthews's operational success has made him the wrong person for the next phase of the job \u2013 not least for the sovereign wealth funds who control the business and want the best possible return. And that means a third or fourth runway. Matthews brought his mastery of detail to the expansion debate, but when combined with that metronomic rigour it gave the impression that he had been making the same argument for six years. Heathrow's contribution has run on autopilot. The airport's owners needs a leader who can persuade the public \u2013 particularly in west London \u2013 as well as the three main political parties, that a new runway is in Britain's best interests. This will require showmanship. The independent airports commission has already gone some way to giving a post-2015 government the political cover for a volte face on expansion, which will be a considerable turnaround given that the main parties are opposed to a new runway. With many west Londoners in marginal constituencies unlikely to ever be won over by the case for a bigger Heathrow, ministers and opposition leaders will need persuading that the political cost is worth it. So the new Heathrow chief executive will need charm and political nous, as well as the ability to keep an eye on an operation that, when it goes wrong, is instantly rebranded as one of Britain's most derided institutions. Energy bosses need not apply. Digby Jones's troubleshooting record deserves scrutiny Here's a tip for Digby Jones, Lord Jones of Birmingham, who will grace our screens as BBC2's The New Troubleshooter on Thursday: in order to shoot trouble, you first need to be able to spot it. You won't find this on Jones's expansive website, but he was formerly director of NHS software provider iSoft, which in the early 2000s appeared to be one of Britain's brightest tech success stories, a stock market darling which was rocketing to a market value of \u00a31bn. Unfortunately, the company had been cooking the books. Exactly who was behind the creative accounting was never determined after a prosecution attempt by the watchdog was botched. That there had been a fraud was never in dispute. Jones was certainly not to blame and he appeared as a prosecution witness. Since then he has repeatedly insisted non-executives can't be blamed if they are lied to. That is not good enough. Last year, a damning report by accountancy regulators at the Financial Reporting Council was unsealed. It revealed that iSoft's auditors had simply not been doing their checks properly in 2003 and 2004, specifically in the area of \"revenue recognition\", where the iSoft abuses lay. Jones had been an iSoft audit committee member \u2013 but he hadn't spotted trouble brewing. He hadn't even spotted it when, in 2004, a Guardian investigation raised specific revenue-recognition concerns. \"Serious and unfounded insinuations of impropriety\" was how he put it. Meanwhile, others at iSoft rushed to the courts to get a gagging order blocking the Guardian from publication. Jones expressly insisted he had looked into Guardian allegations, and that they were entirely without foundation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
