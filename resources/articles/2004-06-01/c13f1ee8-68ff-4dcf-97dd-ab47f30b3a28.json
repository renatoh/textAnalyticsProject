There were no other South African musicians joining him on stage; instead there were the massed ranks of the Jazz Jamaica All Stars and, behind them, dressed in red T-shirts, well over 100 pupils from schools in north-east London, billed as the East London Freedom Singers. \"We never rehearsed together until this week,\" said Masekela, \"but music is for all kinds of people together, and damn the categories.\" Indeed, but it has to work, and Masekela's celebrated blend of South African township jazz and political lyrics were here backed by a band famous for its ska and reggae rhythms, and by an English choir surely too young to remember South Africa's transformation to a multi-racial democracy 10 years ago. It could easily have been a disaster, but it ended up as a triumphant celebration - after an awkward start. In the first half, the All Stars showed off their solo brass skills and the versatile piano work of Alex Wilson before being joined by Masekela on the flugelhorn for a cool, all-instrumental treatment of works by Abdullah Ibrahim and Caiphus Semenya, as well as Masekela's own hit, Grazing in the Grass. Then on came that spectacular massed choir, at first sounding more enthusiastic than soulful, and joined by a vocal trio led by Juliet Roberts. Masekela was now conducting, playing percussion and horn, and eventually singing as well, proving he is still in fine, gruff voice. The choir did remarkably well in negotiating rousing apartheid-era anthems such as Beware Verwoerd before Masekela moved on to a Bob Marley celebration with One Love and No Woman No Cry. By the end, he was discussing politics as he switched from that powerful song of migrant labour, Stimela, to Marley's Lively Up Yourself. Finally, there was a tribute to Nelson Mandela with an emotional revival of Bring Him Back Home that echoed the exhilaration and optimism of those freedom celebrations back in South Africa a decade ago. \u00b7 At Newcastle City Hall (0191-2612606) tomorrow. Then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
