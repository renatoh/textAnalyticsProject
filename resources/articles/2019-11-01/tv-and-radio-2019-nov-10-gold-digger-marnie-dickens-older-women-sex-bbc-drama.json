She did it in 2016 with Thirteen, the addictive BBC Three abduction drama that broke iPlayer records. This week, the writer returns with an equally shocking tale, Gold Digger, about an older woman swept off her feet by a younger man with seemingly nefarious intentions. \u201cI hope everyone has a different opinion when they watch it,\u201d says Dickens. \u201cAnd I want people\u2019s views to change. They might start out hating one character. Then, when they watch the episode that focuses on them, they\u2019ll go, \u2018Oh I see, that\u2019s why they\u2019re like that.\u2019\u201d Dickens cut her teeth on Hollyoaks, moving on to Ripper Street and The Musketeers. Thirteen \u2013 starring a pre-Killing Eve Jodie Comer as abductee Ivy \u2013 showed she liked to take risks. \u201cI was very keen that Thirteen wouldn\u2019t be voyeuristic,\u201d she says of the decision to home in on Ivy\u2019s escape from her captor, rather than her experience as a prisoner. Besides, this was no straightforward victim/perpetrator tale. \u201cIt starts off as a story about a survivor,\u201d says Dickens, \u201cand becomes one about an unreliable narrator.\u201d A similar push-pull lies at the heart of Gold Digger. Julia, a wealthy, divorced mother of three, meets Benjamin, a suave, good-looking and \u2013 crucially \u2013 much younger man. The two embark on a whirlwind affair, much to the disgust and despair of Julia\u2019s adult children. Although Gold Digger has its own twists and turns, there are definite Doctor Foster parallels, from an attractive cast behaving very badly to its opulent interior design. And, like Foster, it also delves into universal themes. \u201cWe all have families and every single one has their own secrets and lies,\u201d says Dickens. \u201cMore than that, we all have our own memories and versions of the same events. We rarely accept that we are wrong in those interpretations.\u201d Female sexuality and desire, particularly the way we deny them in older women, was another theme of her six-parter. \u201cI wanted to look at what it means for a woman when she drops off the desirability scale for the rest of society. You haven\u2019t actually gone away, it\u2019s just that people stop looking. The key to Gold Digger is that Benjamin sees Julia. That\u2019s such a big thing because her ex-husband has only seen her in terms of the marriage they made, and her kids can\u2019t understand her as a sexual being.\u201d It helps, she admits, that the actors \u2013 Julia Ormond and Ben Barnes \u2013 have great chemistry. \u201cYou have to believe in their relationship, to think that it could be genuine, or else the premise doesn\u2019t work. Julia is a very attractive woman in a very authentic way. You can see why he would notice her and be intrigued. The setting is important as well: it\u2019s her birthday, she\u2019s been let down by her kids, and they meet in the British Museum, where she used to work. He sees her as the person she used to be.\u201d Naturally, the story doesn\u2019t unfold in the way you\u2019d expect. It\u2019s full of intrigue, too, much like one of Dickens\u2019 favourite shows, Succession. \u201cInitially,\u201d she says of the HBO hit, \u201cyou think these are all terrible people, but your opinion changes. When I first watched, Tom was a weak, repellent man. By the end of the second series, he was breaking my heart. That\u2019s what a good drama needs. It\u2019s not enough to have adrenaline-driven plots. You need characters to take you on a journey. That\u2019s what keeps you coming back each week.\u201d One thing Dickens doesn\u2019t like is dramas that outstay their welcome: she was determined that Thirteen would only run for one series. \u201cThere are shows that ignore that and carry on. In some cases, they really shouldn\u2019t.\u201d Does she see Gold Digger in the same terms? There\u2019s a pause. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard for writers because, obviously, if people like your work and it does well, there is the temptation to keep going. Also, you become really attached to the characters. With Gold Digger, I hope people feel like its ending is true to that particular tale.\u201d \u2022 Gold Digger starts on BBC One at 9pm on 12 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
