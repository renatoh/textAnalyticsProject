Michael Porter, the president of the Group of 100, a peak body for company chief financial officers, told the Australian Financial Review on Monday that insurance premiums for company directors had increased dramatically because of an \u201cexplosion\u201d of class actions. \u201cWe have been told by our insurers that it is a direct result of class actions, so there is a cost to shareholders as well as on the company\u2019s and directors\u2019 time,\u201d Porter told the AFR.

The attorney general, Christian Porter, has already indicated support for \u201csensible\u201d licensing for litigation funders. Vicki Antzoulatos from Shine Lawyers, the special counsel running a class action against financial services company AMP, said she thought the idea that class action lawsuits had increased and were problematic \u201cwas a bit of a beat up\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s just not the case ... there\u2019s definitely no explosion of class actions,\u201d Antzoulatos said. \u201cRevelations in the banking royal commission show that we need strong laws in place in Australia and companies and the people who run them need to be held to account. These laws serve an important public purpose. \u201cNever have they been more needed than now, with all the instances of corporate misconduct we\u2019ve seen coming out of the banking royal commission. \u201cIf companies are doing the right thing, they won\u2019t face a class action. If companies are following best practice and have good corporate governance, then there\u2019s nothing they need to worry about.\u201d Antzoulatos said it was wrong to suggest litigation funders needed to be reined in or were backing cases that lacked legal merit. \u201cI don\u2019t think funders that are operating to best practice guidelines would have an issue with legislative regulation,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just a myth to say that funders are backing unmeritorious claims because it\u2019s their money that\u2019s on the line at the end of the day.\u201d Andrew Watson, the national head of class actions at the law firm Maurice Blackburn, said they provided an \u201cimportant check and balance on the misconduct of a few\u201d and that could only be of benefit to the majority of law-abiding companies. \u201cWhat remains clear is that a minuscule proportion of ASX-listed companies find themselves facing a shareholder class action in any given year,\u201d Watson said. \u201cPolicy reform in this area should not be driven by exaggerated and misleading claims regarding the number of class actions, the level of settlements or the costs of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance.\u201d Watson said the banking royal commission had demonstrated a need to increase and enhance transparency from large and listed companies to ensure they were held accountable for breaches of the law."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
