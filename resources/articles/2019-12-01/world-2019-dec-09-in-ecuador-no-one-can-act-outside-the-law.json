Ecuador is a sovereign and independent republic and not a res nullius (nobody\u2019s land) where any national or foreign adventurer can act outside the law. Nithyananda entered Ecuador (Guayaquil) on 5 July 2018 as a tourist and then applied for international protection status. While his request was being analysed, he was given a temporary visa on 19 October 2018. After careful consideration of his request, the Ecuadorian National Commission in charge ruled out the application of Nithyananda for refugee status. Not satisfied with the response, he filed a complaint for protective action in the Ecuadorian judiciary system that did not prosper. In consequence, Nithyananda left Ecuador in August 2019. While leaving Ecuador, he said that his destination would be Haiti.
