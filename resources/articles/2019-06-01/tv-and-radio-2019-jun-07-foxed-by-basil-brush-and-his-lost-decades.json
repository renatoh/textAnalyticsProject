His eponymous TV series ended in 1980 before being resurrected in the 2000s. Basil\u2019s heyday and my childhood coincided beautifully in the 1970s. Maybe you were mistaking him for Roland Rat. Which would be a travesty indeed. Mark McDonnell Edinburgh \u2022 We were interested to read about the effects of stressed humans on their pet dogs (Dogs mirror stress levels of owners, researchers find, 7 July). We would like to suggest that, after 12 years living with our border collie, this phenomenon has operated in reverse in our house! Terry and Joan Tossell Kidlington, Oxfordshire \u2022 As a cultivated and polite Leytonstone teenager, Sharon White was also the most gifted student I have known during 30 years of teaching in very different secondary schools. She deserves her position on ability and not as yet another \u201crace, gender, class\u201d nominee \u2013 which is as it should be (Ofcom chief named as new chairman of John Lewis, 7 June). David Ashton Sheringham, Norfolk \u2022 Re Adrian Chiles\u2019 article (My local Sainsbury\u2019s is run by robots \u2013 can a human please help?, G2, 6 June), always ignore a machine and queue. It is surely worth giving the time to save people\u2019s jobs. In my experience, Sainsbury\u2019s respond and open another human-operated till when necessary. Liz Byrne Letchworth, Hertfordshire \u2022 My wife was born on the same day as Sir Alex Ferguson \u2013 31 December, 1941 \u2013 and I have never needed a hair dryer (Letters, 7 June). John Bailey St Albans, Hertfordshire \u2022 I share my exact birthday with Mick Jagger. He is thinner and richer than I am, but I reckon I am better looking.
