Speaking in Iowa on Sunday, the president said the election was a \u201cchoice between a deadly Biden lockdown \u2026 or a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic\u201d. Coronavirus cases are surging in the US and most battleground states are particularly badly affected. On Friday, the total case count surpassed 9m while the daily count set a new world record, at about 100,000. On Sunday 81,493 new cases were reported, according to Johns Hopkins University, and 447 new deaths. Nearly 231,000 people have died. In Iowa, painting a dark and dystopian vision, Trump told a crowd of closely packed supporters, many not wearing masks: \u201cThe Biden plan will turn America into a prison state locking you down, while letting the far-left rioters roam free to loot and burn.\u201d That came after he told a rally in Pennsylvania, another swing state, there would be \u201cno school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no Christmas, no Easters, no Fourth of Julys\u201d under a Biden administration. In an interview in August, Biden was asked if he would shut the US down if scientists said he should do so. He said: \u201cI would shut it down. I would listen to the scientists.\u201d Biden has since clarified that he was referring to whether he would follow advice, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be no need, in my view, to be able to shut down the whole economy.\u201d In October, Biden said: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need to lock down.\u201d If national and battleground state polling proves accurate and he wins on Tuesday, Biden has pledged to introduce a \u201cBeat Covid-19\u201d plan that includes a national mask mandate, a $25bn vaccine plan guaranteeing free access to every American, improved test-and-trace efforts, and help for schools and small businesses. On Sunday, he told a drive-in event in Philadelphia: \u201cThe truth is, to beat the virus, we first have to beat Donald Trump \u2013 he is the virus!\u201d The former vice-president added: \u201cWhen America is heard, I believe the message is going to be clear: It\u2019s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. We\u2019re done with the chaos, the tweets, the anger, the hate.\u201d Trump has repeated his anti-lockdown message across his social media accounts and campaign ads. On Twitter, he wrote: \u201cBiden wants to LOCKDOWN our Country, maybe for years. Crazy!\u201d A campaign ad, entitled \u201cDon\u2019t let Joe Biden lock down our economy\u201d, places footage from the August interview when Biden said he would shut down if scientists advised alongside news footage from lockdowns in Europe and scenes of protest. With very few voters still undecided, Larry Sabato, director of the Centre for Politics at the University of Virginia, said Trump\u2019s approach was not about converting voters \u2013 rather it is about \u201crevving up his base\u201d. \u201cHe is depending on a tremendous turnout tomorrow, and he may get it,\u201d Sabato told the Guardian. \u201cThe whole point of it is to remind voters, or the voters remaining, that Trump\u2019s ace card is the economy, and that he\u2019s determined to restore it \u2013 even if it means, frankly, more infections and deaths. \u201cHe\u2019s made a clear choice and Biden has chosen the other path, which is to do what Europe\u2019s doing \u2013 not necessarily a complete lockdown, but a substantial lockdown and a mask mandate, all the things that Trump and his supporters won\u2019t like. He\u2019s trying to rev them up. And they\u2019re revved up.\u201d Citing recent incidents in Texas, where Trump supporters appeared to try to force a Biden campaign bus off the road, and in New York and New Jersey on Sunday, when hundreds of cars flying Trump flags blocked traffic, Sabato said: \u201cIt\u2019s shocking, really. We\u2019ve never had anything like this \u2026 it just suggests what\u2019s going to happen if he [Trump] loses.\u201d At a midnight rally in Florida, Trump threatened to fire Anthony Fauci, America\u2019s top infectious disease expert. To chants of \u201cfire Fauci\u201d, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody, but let me wait until a little bit after the election. I appreciate the advice. I appreciate it.\u201d In an interview with the Washington Post, Fauci said the US should prepare for \u201ca whole lot of hurt\u201d and predicted a winter of 100,000-plus cases a day and more deaths. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good situation,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
