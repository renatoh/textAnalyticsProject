It may just be running from one end of the playground to another, or doing star jumps, but the aim is to get their hearts beating faster before they go back in and settle down for the next lesson. The school's move on fitness seems to be paying other dividends, too. Academic achievement is rising and head Lorna Baker believes the physical activity programme is part of the success story. Four years ago, when she took over the school, only 17% of its 11-year-olds were hitting the target for their age in the government's maths tests - now it's 60%; in English it was 36% and now it's 74%. The school has put great effort into improving standards, but Baker is convinced the physical activity programme has boosted self-esteem and helped pupils to focus more on their lessons. \"How we all learn depends on how we all feel about ourselves and the biggest change in these children has been their view of themselves,\" she says. \"We all know the feel-good factor that physical activity can bring. The children are feeling better, they are getting on better in class and there are fewer behavioural difficulties.\" As well as the bursts of physical activity, the school has encouraged all kinds of sport inside and outside school hours. Every lunchtime the older children play a game called T-Ball, a kind of rounders, for half an hour. Young Americans have come into the school and taught baseball. Keep-fit sessions have been introduced. All this is on top of normal PE activities. If the weather isn't good enough for outside activities, the children do \"brain gym\" at their desks. They might touch their right elbow and left knee, and vice versa, in rapid succession, or touch their ears with the opposite hands, again very fast, for five minutes. \"It gets the brain thinking and the body moving,\" says Baker. \"It helps the children get ready to focus on the next lesson.\" Children are also encouraged to drink more water and teachers feel this makes them less tired and grumpy and more able to concentrate. The local Sainsbury's store provided more than 300 half-litre sports water bottles - one for each child - and these are kept in wine carriers in the centre of every cluster of desks. Children can drink freely from them and they are refilled throughout the day. Parents back the changes. Baker says: \"They say they have seen a big difference in academic achievement and the way children are learning to want to learn.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
