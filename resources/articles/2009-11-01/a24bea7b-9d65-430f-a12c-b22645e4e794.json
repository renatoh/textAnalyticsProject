The former hooker is adamant that the England captain needs to lead by example against New Zealand this weekend, rather than trying to manage the game as he did against Argentina. \"My advice to Steve Borthwick would be forget about being captain and get out to be the best lock on the field,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"On and off the field he is trying a bit hard to be a captain rather than just going out and playing his natural game and getting the guys to follow him. Lewis Moody, Dylan Hartley, a number of people in the team on Saturday were crying out to follow somebody.\" England's lack of invention in attack saw the team widely criticised. Fitzpatrick expects a similar effort against the All Blacks would result in a hefty defeat. \"The injuries have had a major effect,\" said the 92-times capped international. \"[But] England are struggling, trying to play a kicking game where they are too scared to hold on to the ball. If they do that against the All Blacks they will get beaten convincingly.\" Ireland's Luke Fitzgerald faces up to six months on the sidelines after injuring his knee in the 20-20 draw with Australia at the weekend. The Leinster wing needs surgery to repair the ruptured lateral collateral ligament in his left knee."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
