Our insurers, Congregational &amp; General, agreed to pay a local company to repair it but two years on, the firm has still not been paid. When I called C&amp;G I was told they were still awaiting a report from the loss adjusters \u2013 which was completed 18 months ago. Neither I nor the repair firm have received any response to our many inquiries. CC, Dumbarton C&amp;G blames administrative errors, but does not explain why your repeated calls were ignored. It has now sent a cheque to the long-suffering firm. If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
