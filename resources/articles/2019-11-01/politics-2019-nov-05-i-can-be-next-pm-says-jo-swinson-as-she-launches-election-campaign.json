Swinson told an event in Westminster that Brexit and other political shifts had made December\u2019s election hugely unpredictable, and that she believed her party, which took just under 8% of the votes in 2017, and is polling at about 15% now, could win a majority. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone tell you what has to happen. Change is possible, and you get to choose,\u201d the Lib Dem leader said in her message to voters. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d stand here and say that I\u2019m a candidate to be prime minister. But when I look at Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, I am absolutely certain I could do a better job than either of them.\u201d In reality, senior Lib Dems say privately that even doubling the party\u2019s current tally of 20 MPs in the election would count as a significant success, meaning a more realistic outcome would be to hold the balance of power in a hung parliament. In her speech and answering subsequent questions, Swinson reiterated her stance that the Lib Dems would not actively support either Johnson or Corbyn as prime minister. Asked if she could back a Labour government, she was scathing about its leader. \u201cOn so many grounds, Jeremy Corbyn is not fit for the job of prime minister,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the biggest issue of the day, he has prevaricated and will not give a straight answer. Even now if you ask him whether he is remain or leave he will not tell you how he would vote. \u201cHis plans for the economy would take us back to the 1970s. I believe he would be a threat to our national security.\u201d But asked to outline any details of what the party would do \u2013 for example supporting Labour if Corbyn was no longer in charge \u2013 Swinson declined to do so, saying only: \u201cAs Liberal Democrat leader, what I am offering to the public is a Liberal Democrat government.\u201d The Lib Dems are part of a remain-based voting alliance with Plaid Cymru and the Greens, under which parties will stand down in each others\u2019 favour in some seats, with details on the plan due later this week. Asked why the alliance could not be extended to remain-minded Labour MPs in ultra-marginal seats such as Rosie Duffield in Canterbury, Swinson said she admired many things about Duffield but added: \u201cShe\u2019s still the Labour party. And people in the Labour party are standing on a manifesto that\u2019s going to be about delivering Brexit. It\u2019s about putting Jeremy Corbyn into No 10. That\u2019s not something that we can support.\u201d She also condemned Johnson, noting what she said were similarities to the US president: \u201cWith his big lies, his brash promises and his attitude to women, it\u2019s pretty clear who Boris Johnson is modelling himself on \u2013 Donald Trump.\u201d In her speech, Swinson highlighted the new Lib Dem campaign pledge of a \u201cremain bonus\u201d, which the party argues would be \u00a350bn made available for public services over five years by protecting the economy through stopping Brexit. The party\u2019s policy, agreed at its autumn conference, is that it would revoke Brexit without a referendum in the admittedly unlikely event it won a majority in the Commons, or else would push for a second referendum. Asked how a Lib Dem government could unite the nation, Swinson argued that there was not a Brexit plan that commanded majority support across the county. \u201cAs Liberal Democrats we are standing up for what we believe in, and being very honest and straightforward about that,\u201d she said. \u201cI recognise there are differences of opinion on this issue, and I think people recognise and appreciate that we are consistent and we are firm in what we are standing for.\u201d While Brexit dominated her speech, Swinson said EU membership was emblematic of the Lib Dems\u2019 wider approach, arguing: \u201cIt is about who we are as a country. It\u2019s about the choices that we make \u2013 whether or not we think it\u2019s a good idea or not to work with other countries, with our closest neighbours, to meet our shared challenges. It is about recognising that our humanity does not stop at our borders.\u201d The election, she argued, would shape \u201cthe future of our country for generations to come\u201d. Swinson said: \u201cThis is not a normal election, it\u2019s not a typical choice of whether you want the red team or the blue team to be in government for a few more years.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
