The tourists suffered no fresh injury misfortune from the two European cup finals over the weekend and flew out of Heathrow with 36 players fit and ready to play. The Leinster centre, Brian O'Driscoll, was included in the fit category despite suffering a recurrence of shoulder trouble during the Heineken Cup final victory over Leicester. He will not feature in Saturday's opening game against a Royal XV in Rustenburg, nor will the other five players involved in the Edinburgh final or the Northampton prop, Euan Murray, who featured in the European Challenge Cup final on Friday night. \"I did have a second look when Brian went down,\" said McGeechan. \"He managed himself very well and put himself on the wing. He has felt the problem for a while but he would be able to play on Saturday if required. We will rest all the players who were involved in the finals on the weekend both to give them time to recover [I hope they had a few beers and relaxed last night] and because of the work the others have got through in training this week.\" O'Driscoll, who is going on his third Lions tour having captained the side in 2005 when a spear tackle confined him to 60 seconds of Test action and left him with a dislocated shoulder, said he was not concerned by the problem to his right shoulder. \"I have had a few stingers, that is all,\" he went on. \"I tried to kick the ball out on Saturday with an ugly scissor movement just so I could get treatment, but at no time was I concerned about my place on the tour. One thing you can be sure of is that there will be more guys being called into the squad in the coming weeks to cover for injuries, but you cannot waste time thinking about that. What marks out a Lions tour is the magnitude f of it and the high calibre of players you are surrounded by. It sharpens you up not just physically but also in terms of attitude. You do not let niggling injuries play on your mind as you normally would.\" The fourth player called into the squad since the original announcement, James Hook, arrived at the squad's training base in Bagshot on Saturday afternoon. The Wales fly-half will cover for the wing Leigh Halfpenny, who is receiving treatment on a thigh injury and will fly to South Africa when he is given the all-clear to resume training. Hook has been promoted ahead of the England outside-half, Danny Cipriani.The Lions spent all Friday trying to determine the fitness of Cipriani, who had not played for a month since the end of the regular Premiership season, but struggled to get hold of the player and were given conflicting reports by England. The Scotland utility back, Chris Paterson, was also on the shortlist, with the Lions needing to find another goal-kicker with Halfpenny's absence reducing them to two specialists. Paterson lost out when the Lions decided that another outside-half was needed otherwise Ronan O'Gara and Stephen Jones would have to be involved in every match because of goal-kicking. Cipriani was chosen in the Saxons last week by England, who promoted Sam Vesty into the senior squad ahead of him, but it was only on Friday night that the Lions opted for Hook. \"I was in a restaurant with my family celebrating my girl-friend's birthday when my mobile rang,\" said Hook, who had been due to leave for Canada with Wales on Saturday. \"I ignored it for a while but the caller was persistent and, when I answered, it was Ian McGeechan. I knew I was in the frame to be called up but it was still a shock, if a very pleasant one.\" The Lions were also conscious that choosing Cipriani ran the risk of turning the tour into a circus with publicity always following in the 21-year old's slipstream. Given the fact they have spent the last month preaching that everyone was equal and that the success of the tour depended on all the players buying into that, bowing to the cult of celebrity would have been contradictory. \"The pre-preparation is as good as it has ever has been on a Lions tour I have been involved in,\" said McGeechan, who toured South Africa as a player in 1974. \"In terms of the degree of difficulty, this trip has to be at the top because we have so little time to prepare: the first Test will be played in less than four weeks, and the approach and attitude of the players this week have given us the start we needed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
