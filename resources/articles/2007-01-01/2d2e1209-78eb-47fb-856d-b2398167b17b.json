This is not just wishful thinking ... wine drinkers have less heart disease and diabetes and are less likely to suffer from dementia\" - does raise the spirits. This is not to say that binge-drinkers (and half a bottle a day puts you in that category) are safe. But Corder has identified a compound, procyanidin, a type of polyphenol, abundant in some red wines (and in cranberries, pomegranates and walnuts), that has what he calls a \"potent positive effect on blood vessels\" and so is good for the heart. Among the wines he found to be especially rich in procyanidins are several from producers I've recommended before - the big beast that is Ch\u00e2teau le Cedre Cuv\u00e9e le Cedre (\u00a322.44, Caves de Pyrene, near Guildford), say, and the delicious Domaine de l'Hortus Grand Cuv\u00e9e Pic St Loup (\u00a312.04, Caves de Pyrene, H&amp;H Bancroft). Corder pays special attention to the wines of Madiran and C\u00f4tes de Saint Mont - tannic, challenging, extreme wines based on the tannat grape which as much resemble a Blossom Hill red as a pterodactyl does a jelly baby. I tried a handful - unyielding, heavy characters - of which I was most taken by the relatively accessible Ch\u00e2teau de Sabazan 2003, C\u00f4tes de Saint-Mont, France (\u00a312.99, Nicolas, Grape Ideas, Bedales) and, despite the grotesquery of its metal label and red wax seal, the dusty Madiran Pl\u00e9nitude 2001 (around \u00a314.99, Bedales, Adnams). But I can't help feeling it might be easier to take the procyanidins from food, and drink purely for pleasure and at whim. Hence these white wines, which are cheaper and picked to match with clean foods, in case you're still trying to be healthy.
