Tony de Brum, foreign minister of the tiny Marshall Islands, and a founder of the new alliance, insisted Australia had not yet joined, and Australia was not represented at a press conference to announce new members \u2013 which also include Brazil, Switzerland, Iceland, the Philippines, the Seychelles, Luxembourg and Canada. But Julie Bishop tweeted that Australia had joined the grouping in response to Twitter criticism. De Brum later told the media, \u201cwe are delighted to learn of Australia\u2019s interest and look forward to hearing what more they may be able to do to join our coalition of high ambition here in Paris.\u201d He said all countries were \u201cwelcome to join\u201d but needed to \u201cbring your credentials with you.\u201d Bishop downplayed the importance of the group. \u201cThis is not a negotiating coalition, this is a group of people who say we all share a view about an ambitious agreement \u2013 of course we do, we\u2019ve said that from the outset ... we\u2019re focusing on getting an agreement, not which groups we might be signing up to ... our priority is the text,\u201d she told journalists. While not a permanent negotiating bloc, the coalition is acting as a significant counterweight in the Paris talks to the big developing countries, whose negotiators spent most of Thursday night in closed door meetings arguing for a watering down of parts of the draft text prepared by the French presidency and forcing the French to extend the talks into Saturday. While world leaders are no longer at the summit, the US president, Barack Obama, has also been trying to smooth the way for a deal by phone, calling the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. According to the White House read-out, the leaders \u201ccommitted that their negotiating teams in Paris would continue to work closely together and with others to realise the vision of an ambitious climate agreement\u201d. Bishop said she still \u201cfelt a strong level of optimism\u201d and the most important thing about deal, if it is clinched, would be the \u201cunited global effort\u201d of 183 countries all agreeing to reduce their emissions. Multiple sources said the Chinese negotiators in the second all-night \u201cindaba\u201d (a Zulu word for meeting) sought to dilute the agreement\u2019s long-term goals and the proposed system to link country\u2019s promises to reduce greenhouse emissions against a global \u201cstocktake\u201d. Saudi Arabia and India argued for changes that would even further weaken the deal. Chinese deputy foreign minister Lui Jianmin dismissed the \u201ccoalition of ambition\u201d as a \u201cperformance\u201d and said China was arguing against the proposed goal that parties aim for \u201cgreenhouse gas emission neutrality in the second half of the century\u201d because the meaning of the phrase was unclear. \u201cWe heard of this so-called ambitious coalition only since a few days ago, of course it has had a high profile in the media, but we haven\u2019t seen they have really acted for ambitious emissions commitments, so this is kind of performance by some members,\u201d he said at a press conference. \u201cIt is wrong to say China is blocking the concept of climate neutrality, we raised a concern because this is a new concept, there is no definition \u2013 we don\u2019t understand, if you don\u2019t know the concept, why you would put it in a legally binding agreement,\u201d he said. He also defended China\u2019s position on another sticking point \u2013 the insistence by countries like the US and Australia that the Paris agreement should start the process of shifting all countries to a common system of reporting and reviewing emission reductions. The developing world wants to continue with the current two-tier system where obligations are born by rich countries. \u201cIt is not only China\u2019s request, it is a request from all developing countries, you should not focus on this as China\u2019s request,\u201d he said. \u201cOur capacity and national conditions means still we shall have some difficulties ... so the process needs to be more about encouragement. We need to avoid any punitive or intrusive measures,\u201d He said the US secretary of state, John Kerry, had spoken of the \u201cdomestic difficulty\u201d the US would have if national targets were part of the legally binding agreement in Paris. \u201cI think all members would say for the Paris agreement we must have the United States on board as the largest developed world country in the world ... so for some issues, that should be considered in finding a solution acceptable to all,\u201d he said. Kerry told journalists he was hoping the marathon negotiations would see contentious issues \u201cmelt away\u201d. As negotiators tried to finalise the deal, leading scientists pointed out the disconnect between what negotiators were arguing about and what was actually needed to address global warming. Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Research in Britain said the current text was \u201csomewhere between dangerous and deadly\u201d for the most vulnerable nations in the world. He said it was weaker than the deal that had come out of Copenhagen and \u201cnot consistent with the science.\u201d After another day of private and small group meetings, the French will now produce yet another draft agreement \u2013 their third attempt at finding a compromise deal \u2013 on Saturday morning Paris time before the conference meets for what is supposed to be the final time. Greenpeace said Brazil\u2019s decision to join the coalition of ambition \u201ccould change the whole dynamic in the last closing hours of this conference\u201d because major developing countries had been missing from the alliance. Earlier in the conference, Bishop had smoothed over a spat with de Brum over her parliamentary mocking of claims by Labor foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek that one of the Marshall Islands was already underwater. Plibersek had issued a transcript with the wrong name of the island she was referring to, but the island was under water."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
