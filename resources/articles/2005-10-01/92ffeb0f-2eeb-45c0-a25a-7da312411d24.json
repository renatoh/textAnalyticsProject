The gift - unprecedented for an Arab country - will provide a football stadium in the northern Israeli-Arab town of Sakhnin. The local team, Bnei Sakhnin, is the only club in the Israeli premier league with Arab players. The move reflects warming relations between Israel and the energy-rich Gulf state. At the UN last month, Qatar's foreign minister praised Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and urged Arab countries to respond with new overtures. Qatar, which often courts controversy, was a key US ally during the invasion of Iraq, providing a base for Centcom's headquarters. At the same time, just a few miles away, al-Jazeera television, which is funded by the emir, broadcast reports of the war that were condemned by the Bush administration. Al-Jazeera has been dubbed \"the Bin Laden channel\" by its critics for broadcasting tapes from the al-Qaida leader, but it was also the first Arab channel to broadcast interviews with Israeli ministers. The sports complex deal was signed in Doha on Monday by Sheikh Saoud al-Thani, head of Qatar's Olympic committee, and an Israeli delegation headed by Ahmad Tibi, an Arab Knesset member. The signing took place on the same day that Qatar was elected as a non-permanent member of the UN security council, with Israeli backing. In a move than seems intended to placate Arab critics of normalisation with Israel, Qatar will pay directly for the construction work and supervise it. \"Neither the club nor the municipality [of Sakhnin] will receive any direct donation,\" a Qatari Olympic committee official told Reuters. The exact cost of the stadium was not confirmed, but it was variously reported at between $6m and $10m (\u00a33.4-\u00a35.7m). Mr Tibi said talks on providing funds for the stadium began five months ago, during which he met several Qatari officials and showed them maps and documents related to the plans. Engineers from the Qatari Olympic committee later visited Sakhnin. \"This is the largest financial support that Sakhnin has ever received from any outside source,\" he told the Associated Press. \"We very much appreciate the readiness to listen and positively react to our demands, especially since Sakhnin suffers from unequal treatment and policy, and we are trying to bridge the gap with assistance from the Arab world. This part of the Palestinian people [Israeli Arabs] has been neglected for more than 50 years by the Arab world,\" he said. Israeli-Arabs make up about 20% of the 6.8 million population. Despite having citizenship, they have long suffered from economic and political discrimination. Aside from Haifa and three smaller cities, they generally live in separate towns and neighbourhoods from Jews. Sakhnin's football team, with a squad of 12 Arabs, seven Jews and four foreigners, has been portrayed as a symbol of coexistence. It has the smallest budget in the Israeli premier league, but last year won the country's State Cup and earned a place in the Uefa Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
