The Manchester United striker caused a government U-turn on Tuesday when his campaign prompted Boris Johnson to agree to provide vouchers. Guardiola has previously voiced his views regarding the imprisoning of Catalan politicians and was fined by the Football Association in 2018 for displaying a yellow ribbon. Addressing those who think athletes should not speak about other issues, he said: \u201cMaybe these stupid people don\u2019t believe you are human being too. We can have an opinion the same as a nurse, a doctor or even a politician. We are humans and why shouldn\u2019t we say our opinion when you believe you can do a better society, when you are public? \u201cWhat Raheem Sterling has done many times [regarding racism], other players in our club, Marcus Rashford or whoever; of course they have to use these platforms to make a better society. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to get more money \u2013 fortunately for them they have enough \u2013 so they do it to get a better place to live, for families, for kids, for the next generation. I admire a lot these kinds of gestures because they do it for all of us.\u201d Guardiola also praised Premier League clubs who refused to use the government\u2019s furlough scheme during the coronavirus pandemic. Liverpool, Tottenham and Bournemouth decided to do so before reversing the stance, while Newcastle, Norwich and Sheffield United have taken advantage of the policy. \u201cI would like to say, too, how pleased I am for all the clubs in the Premier League that don\u2019t ask the government for money,\u201d he said. City welcome Arsenal for Wednesday night\u2019s second match of football\u2019s restart, the first of at least 12 games they have remaining because of FA Cup and Champions League commitments. The latter competition is scheduled to resume in August, with City holding a 2-1 lead over Real Madrid from the first leg of their last-16 tie. If Guardiola\u2019s side progress they will have little rest before next season. \u201cWe would love to not have a break,\u201d the manager said. \u201cIt would be incredibly good news for us. It means we go through. [But] honestly right now there is not one thought from me about the Champions League, about Madrid. We have to see how it goes on. Normally I don\u2019t prepare games or ideas thinking much longer. Just Arsenal is in my mind and after how we recover to play against Burnley [on Monday]. \u201cWe are going to do the best for them [players], take care of them, try to organise and have the best facilities for the players to be fit.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
