Special crowd-control measures were enforced at Birmingham\u2019s New Street station, and stores across the country were forced to hire extra security in the wake of last month\u2019s ugly scenes, when shoppers fought over access to bargains. With widespread delays in the delivery of online orders, more shoppers are expected to head for Britain\u2019s high streets and shopping centres before the big day. The seven-day period before Christmas Day could see a 7% rise in spending on the same period last year. Kevin Jenkins, Visa Europe\u2019s UK and Ireland managing director, said: \u201cBlack Friday kickstarted Christmas on the high street and online this year, but the busiest bricks-and-mortar day will likely remain in its traditional slot close to Christmas. \u201cRetailers\u2019 multi-channel approach should cause a surge in footfall from click-and-collect sales too, with the opportunity for further shopping in-store when consumers arrive.\u201d Three-quarters of the top 100 high street retailers have begun their sales already in a bid to lure shoppers, with discounts averaging 45%, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Consumer analyst Sue Hayward said: \u201cPeople are starting to get a little more money in their pockets. We are seeing things like petrol and food prices slightly down. It is important for the retailers that they entice people into spending money, rather than paying off their mortgage, which may be the sensible option.\u201d Tuesday, however, is set to be the busiest single shopping day of the festive season, with Visa Europe predicting that shoppers will spend \u00a31.3bn, or \u00a315,278 every second, on its cards \u2013 estimating 34 million transactions, with the peak coming in the lunch-hour break between 1pm and 2pm. American business news publication Quartz said that the day \u201cbeautifully reflects the ancient British practice of leaving everything to the last minute, known as \u2018faffing\u2019\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
