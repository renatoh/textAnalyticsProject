The England international was caught in the first half by Jordan Henderson but played on until the 50th minute when replaced by on-loan Barcelona forward Gerard Deulofeu. Baines left Goodison Park on crutches and had a scan on Saturday night but will require further tests on Monday to discover the full extent of the injury. The influential left-back is hopeful of returning within a month but will miss a demanding period for Roberto Mart\u00ednez's side, including Premier League matches against Stoke City, Manchester United \u2013 who tried several times to sign the 28-year-old in the summer \u2013 Arsenal, Fulham and Swansea City. Mirallas, meanwhile, has said he expected referee, Phil Dowd, to issue a red card for his dangerous challenge on Luis Su\u00e1rez on Saturday. The Belgium international was only booked for a first-half lunge into the Liverpool striker's knee, a tackle Brendan Rodgers described as career-threatening. \"When I made the challenge the first thing I thought was that it was going to be a red card,\" admitted Mirallas, who had scored Everton's opening goal before the incident and was involved in their two goals afterwards. \"I was genuinely going for the ball but I know I caught him on the knee and I said sorry straight away. I might have been OK because it was the derby, because in those matches there is always a lot of contact, a lot of tackles going in. There is a lot of pressure on the players and the fans in these sort of games. Sometimes when you put a tackle in you think: 'Oh shit,' like this one.\" Mirallas was forced out of last season's Goodison derby at half-time by a Su\u00e1rez foul that went unpunished but the Everton forward insisted Saturday's challenge was not premeditated. He added: \"I had said to Su\u00e1rez soon after the kick off when we were standing close to each other: 'Do you remember last season, you kicked me?' He laughed and said: 'Yes, fair enough,' but my tackle had nothing to do with a year ago. And Su\u00e1rez played for a long time after that with no problem, with no injury, so he was OK and I am glad he wasn't injured.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
