What the author of the article wrote was that many GPs and hospital staff have not encountered the disease (Concern over big rise in cases of Lyme disease, 5 December, page 18). \u2022 In a piece about the closure of Britain\u2019s last deep coalmine, Kellingley colliery in North Yorkshire (The end of the mine, 5 December, page 34), we referred to a \u201cdemonstration planned for 19 December\u201d.

It was Bernard Haitink. \u2022 A picture of choirboys skating on Winchester Cathedral\u2019s ice rink was headlined \u201cCathedral\u2019s sopranos on skates\u201d (9 December, page 21).
