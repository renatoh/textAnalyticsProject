The move effectively ends all policy cooperation between the two parties, and also raises the prospect of a wider deterioration in relations. Many senior Liberal Democrats believe Tony Blair is now confident of another large overall Commons majority and will abandon his troublesome co-operation with the Lib Dems. At the weekend the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, again warned that any Labour decision to drop its manifesto commitment to a referendum on electoral reform for the Commons would spell the end of the relationship between the two parties. He was backed yesterday by a leading Liberal Democrat advocate of cooperation, Lord McNally, who said dropping the referendum pledge would mark the end of the drive to rid British politics of party tribalism. The latest deterioration in relations came when Labour cancelled a joint committee due to meet tomorrow on the future of Lords reform. Labour said no common agenda could be agreed. Labour sources said the row meant there was no prospect of further meetings ahead of the election. The proposed joint policy had been intended to be presented to the electorate as a sign of the benefits of cooperation between the two parties. It would have also made it easier to speed second stage Lords reform through parliament after the election. The Liberal Democrats effectively hold the balance of power in the Lords, so the failure to agree a joint policy may set back the likelihood of early reform to the Lords which still contains over 90 hereditary peers. The decision to pull the plug on joint cooperation was taken by the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, the leader of the Commons, Margaret Beckett, and the leader of the Lords, Lady Jay. They had been struggling for months to finalise a joint agenda for the talks with their Liberal Democrat counterparts Robert Maclennan and the Lib Dem leader of the Lords, Lord Rodgers. The Liberal Democrats had been insisting that the joint committee - a sub-committee of the joint consultative committee set up by Sir Paddy Ashdown and Tony Blair - should discuss the future composition of a reformed second chamber, as well as its powers. Labour insisted that the composition of the Lords, including the proportion of elected members, has already been decided by the royal commission chaired by Lord Wakeham. The two parties, Labour maintained, could only discuss the powers and procedures of a reformed second chamber. The Liberal Democrats want a largely elected second chamber, but Tony Blair wants only about 80-90 elected peers. He fears a larger element would lead to a conflict of roles between the upper and lower chambers. Labour said last night any changes to government proposals could only come legitimately in debate when it produced a bill in the next parliament."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
