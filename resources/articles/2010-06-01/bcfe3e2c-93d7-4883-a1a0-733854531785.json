You wonder if each of them leaves his successor a letter to be opened in times of crisis. It instructs him to blame failure on the debilitating domestic schedule over Christmas and New Year. Sven-Goran Eriksson touched on that topic after elimination from the 2006 World Cup and Fabio Capello is now taking up the theme. Some would clearly benefit from a pause and Wayne Rooney is a forward with nothing left in him, particularly not goals. However, that was noteworthy because it was unusual. No one else looked such a candidate for surgery as the Manchester United player with the injured ankle. Capello's problems were not really exceptional and the lack of running power mostly reflected the elderly squad he had chosen. The Italian is currently a cause for dismay. His famed prowess was hidden from view and in the group phase he barely figured out how to cope with the United States, Algeria and Slovenia, countries ranked 14th, 30th and 25th in the world. Indeed, the fact that the Americans outperformed England put Capello in difficulties he did not have the means to resolve. His side, runners-up in Group C, were marched towards a debacle in which Germany exposed them as dowdy, slow, old and predictable. With the 4-1 victory, Joachim L\u00f6w's side scored more goals on Sunday than England did in all four of their fixtures combined. This debacle may well be the lowest point in Capello's managerial career. The previous nadir was his second term with Milan. He got the sack before the club ended the 1997-98 Serie A programme in 10th place, but Capello was eventually able to retort that several of his signings did ultimately come good. By contrast, the nub of the matter with England is that he has not kindled any hope for the future. There is exasperation over his refusal to make space in the party for, say, Adam Johnson rather than Shaun Wright-Phillips, a fellow Manchester City midfielder who has had much less impact at Eastlands of late. In that area, Capello has not fulfilled his remit. There is an obligation at least to try to leave a legacy. The Italian, after the early excitement of Theo Walcott's introduction, has usually committed himself to hard-nosed pros. While the Premier League can be scolded for not delivering enough contenders, Capello has also been wedded to conservatism in all its forms. This World Cup has witnessed few teams of such tedium. As the England squad were packing their bags yesterday, Capello sat before the microphones for the last time at this tournament and insisted that his style is always 4-4-2. That is disingenuous. There may be a quartet who fit the bill as midfielders and a pair who would be classed as attackers but their relationship to one another in the structure of the team is open to debate. It was not just the fresh legs that made England exciting last autumn. The 4-2-3-1 formation had Rooney tucked behind the target man Emile Heskey, and the fluidity regularly washed away the opposition. The regimented 4-4-2 system on Sunday was a joy to Germany, who relished their own individualism in the knowledge that England would never surprise them. The formation was flat and so, too, were the players. There was no excitement to lift the squad out of the doldrums. Before long, we may hear tales of stultifying weeks in Capello's severe company. That should be treated firstly as contemptible excuse-making, but it is also true that the manager did not get the best out of his men. The FA could be tempted to part company with him, assuming a settlement was reached that fell well short of the \u00a312m in wages reportedly due to him between now and 2012. The ruling body will still have to ask themselves if they can identify someone who will do better. Harry Redknapp and Roy Hodgson, men of Capello's generation, are receiving mentions and there is much to admire in their careers, but neither boasts of Serie A, La Liga and Champions League trophies as he can. The dilemma for the FA is that one of the great personages of football history is already on the payroll. They simply have to be persuaded that there is still the energy and originality in the 64-year-old to build a better and younger side. Informal though the talks may be, Capello has to go through a job interview all over again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
