While it was the Rams' first trip to Wembley, the Patriots returned to the scene of their 2009 domination of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Like on that occasion, New England attempted to limit the effect of crossing so many time zones by only flying into London on Friday morning. \"We all felt the team was ready to go today,\" said Belichick. \"Wembley Stadium is obviously big, it's cavernous. It's a big crowd, a good crowd. Playing on grass is always good. We play most of our games on turf so it's good to see the guys come in a little dirty, grass stains and all that. It's a good feeling watching football and guys are pulling dirt out of their facemasks. We don't see a lot of that back in the States. It was good old-fashioned football, the guys liked it.\" The experience was much less enjoyable for the Rams and defensive end Chris Long, who admitted losing so heavily in London had spoiled a trip to an \"awesome city\". He said: \"It hurts no matter where it's played. We could have played this game in the parking lot at Rams Park and it would have hurt just as bad. Absolutely hate to lose, so it hurts no matter what the stakes. I hope the rest of the season we just learn from this. I have a lot of good memories of this trip minus the thing we came here for which is to win a football game.\" On the game's opening drive the Patriots looked like a group who had been in Europe for little more than 48 hours as the Rams quarterback Sam Bradford connected with Chris Givens for a 50-yard touchdown pass, but New England dominated from that point onwards. \"It feels good finally to put one game together as a team,\" said Patriots defensive talk Vince Wilfork. \"Doing a lot of things correct, just playing good football all around. It's just a stepping stone. Guys can see that if we play together and don't hurt ourselves we can be a dangerous football team.\" Coming out of half-time with a 28-pointlead, the Patriots ended the game as a contest on the opening drive of the third quarter after Brandon Lloyd caught his second touchdown pass. Rams fans in St Louis had not been happy with giving up one of their home games for this venture and watching from across the Atlantic would not have made the sight they witnessed any less painful. Yet with a crowd of 84,004 at Wembley, the second largest since the NFL started making trips to London, it is not hard to see why the Rams were willing to get involved in the league's international experiment. American fans might question the idea of sending a game out of the country every year, but back in the US only one game has drawn a bigger crowd so far this season. The spectacle of over 80,000 fans walking along Wembley Way will hearten NFL owners who voted for London to host a second game next season as the league ramps up its aspirations across the Atlantic. The NFL's International Series has made London its home since 2007 but it remains a concept without an identity. Despite the league's clear intentions to find a club for British fans to attach themselves to, none have been forthcoming. Tampa Bay flirted with a regular fixture in London for a couple of years and the Rams did so for even less. For the next four years one of the league's most troubled clubs, the Jacksonville Jaguars, will try to make a home away from home in London. Whether that will be enough for Londoners, burnt from these recent experiences, to adopt another team altogether remains unknown. As fans filtered out of Wembley before this one-sided contest had come to an end, it was clear the Jaguars will need to put on a better display than St. Louis did against the Patriots if they are to build a following in London.
