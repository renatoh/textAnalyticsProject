It also has a stand-alone computer in each classroom, so there's considerable opportunity to use ICT in design and technology. Indeed, we've done a number of projects over the last few years. One of the main ones involved work on the subject of fairgrounds. I made a CD-Rom detailing some rides and posing questions which the children used to find out more about how fairground rides work and to produce leaflets advertising the rides. They also designed and made models of their own rides, using pulleys and motors, which they could then link to a control box to make the rides go backwards and forwards. Some children decorated their rides with clip art produced on the computer to give the ride a quality finish. We've also just completed a project on the gazebo and pergola which the parents are building in the playground, including a competition for the children to come up with a design. Year five used a spreadsheet to map out the costs of the bricks, cement and other materials. It was a useful exercise because it used a real-life project that was relevant to the children. We have tried to introduce ICT into food technology projects, too. When year three were studying sandwich snacks, they developed a questionnaire to find out people's preferences before designing their own snacks. The children put the results of their survey in to a database, and used it to create graphs and other ways of analysing their results. That's the beauty of ICT. It helps you link lots of elements in a project together, while making some of the tasks a lot easier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
