Pennies From Heaven (an undervalued American version of Dennis Potter's TV mini-series), Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (a spot-on spoof of the Forties film noir) and Roxanne (the updated Cyrano de Bergerac) have taken on classic status. But a rot set in when the sentimental Parenthood seemed to convince him that his future lay in soppy family movies, and it has continued through a series of dire remakes - Father of the Bride and its sequel, a disastrous big-screen Sgt Bilko, the dreadful The Out-of-Towners, Cheaper by the Dozen and now, worst of the lot, Cheaper by the Dozen 2. In the charming 1950 comedy Cheaper by the Dozen, Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy played the real-life time-and-motion pioneers Frank Gilbreth (1868-1924) and his wife, Lillian, who used their 12 children as a laboratory to test their theories. In the sequel, Belles on Their Toes, Lillian carried on their work after her husband's death. The pointless Martin remakes misleadingly describe their source as 'a novel' by two of the Gilbreth children and the philoprogenitive protagonist becomes Tom Baker, a soppy-stern high-school football coach with a disorderly family and no theory of any kind to pursue. Sadly, he lives on into the sequel, which is set at a lakeside summer cottage in Wisconsin where Tom renews a fiercely competitive relationship with a childhood rival (Eugene Levy), who has done better in life and raised a family of eight depressed overachievers. The movie jerks along from one crudely handled farcical scene of destruction to another, and the sentimentality increases exponentially. As the plot works towards the competing families gathered around the hospital bed to ogle Tom's first grandchild, the treacle spreads like molten lava and everyone ends up flat on their molasses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
