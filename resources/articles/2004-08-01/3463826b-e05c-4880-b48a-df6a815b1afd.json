Ten-foot-high ceilings, Georgian room spaces and windows, and a stairwell so gracious that it lacks only a young woman in a dramatic ballgown on the top step to complete the picture. So, a bit of urban in-filling, next to the brewery stables, started just after the demise of George IV and while William IV was reigning, before the ascent to the throne of the young Victoria. Hardly surprising then that it also has a touch of interesting human history. One Saturday evening last month, young Henri, the jack russell, shot up the garden when four faces appeared over the double gates at the perimeter of the property. We went to investigate and an elderly gent, the senior of the quartet, told us that he had been born in a first-floor bedroom here in 1918. Having well-developed nostalgia genes ourselves we invited the company in so that he might see his childhood home. The invitation was readily accepted and his grandson helped Malcolm up to the first floor. He told us of the household he remembered, the kitchen range, the maidservants, the horses in the brewery stables next door. It was only when the local paper recorded a distinguished visitor to the town that I found our caller had gone on to a career as a military chaplain and was still an honorary chaplain to the monarch. Later that week, while I was no doubt having a game of golf, my wife had another nostalgia-driven visitor. Christine had been a girl in the house, where her father was the chemist, during the 1950s. She was bringing her daughter to see the house and town of her childhood."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
