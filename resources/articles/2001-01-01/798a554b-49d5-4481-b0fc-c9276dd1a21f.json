Walker, appointed by the Football Association to cut the overall cost of the project, is keen to have athletics included and for the 2005 world championships to be staged at the new stadium. Support is growing among sport and government officials for the FA to commit more money towards Wembley and for the involvement of athletics. This could result in cutting the borrowed amount to \u00a3215m, thereby increasing City confidence. The inclusion of athletics in the project would mean that the FA would not have to return \u00a320m of lottery money as it had promised last year after it initially emerged that athletics would not be involved at Wembley. The FA subsidiary company Wembley National Stadium Limited, of which Walker is chairman, would also receive a further \u00a340m of lottery money, already pledged, for the staging of the 2005 championships. Though some of this money would go towards the purchase of land close to Wembley where a warm-up track would be constructed, it would also contribute to the overall cost of the new stadium. In addition to this \u00a360m, the FA will also be asked to fund the project directly, with some estimates putting the figure at \u00a3100m, the amount the organisation originally agreed to underwrite for the construction of the stadium. City institutions in particular are keen for the FA to partly fund the project as a way of showing confidence in its economic viability. Walker is currently involved in negotiations with parties involved in the Wembley project and is looking at how a running track could be included within the new stadium and costs cut. The FA has already stated that the stadium is unlikely to be built with hotel and office space and this could lead to a further saving of \u00a335m on the overall cost. In total, together with FA money, the involvement of athletics and a more streamlined stadium, the overall amount of money that needed to be borrowed could be cut by \u00a3195m. The FA is particularly keen to see athletics return to the Wembley project as this would ease any financial concerns it has about the project. Walker is due to report at the end of January on proposals to amend the Wembley plans and last night met the sports minister Kate Hoey and culture minister Chris Smith outlining some of his ideas. The WNSL board will tomorrow also receive an update on the project's review from Walker. The City balked at the previous plan to rebuild Wembley, refusing to contribute to attempts by JP Morgan Chase, formerly known as Chase Manhattan, to raise \u00a3410m from rival banks. Fresh attempts to raise money from the City are unlikely to begin until early next month, which suggests that funds are unlikely to reach Wembley's coffers until March at the earliest, leading to further delays to the proposed opening date of May 2004. Last night City sources claimed that direct funding from the FA would increase investor confidence but that cutting the borrowed amount to \u00a3215m might prove to be too optimistic. JP Morgan Chase refused to comment last night. But bankers asked to participate in the previous fund-raising exercise said JP Morgan Chase had yet to return to them with a revised offer. One banker said: \"They must feel it just would not be credible to come back until the details of the project have been sorted out.\" Concern is also increasing within the FA over how much money the organisation should invest in the new Wembley. Some FA directors are reluctant for the game's governing body to commit more money than originally planned until they see a full business plan that convinces them the project will make money. Others feel they have little choice but to pour in more money. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
