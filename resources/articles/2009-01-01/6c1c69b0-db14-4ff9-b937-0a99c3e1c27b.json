Bridge, who has won 32 caps despite spending much of his club career as an understudy to Ashley Cole, is expected to arrive in Manchester tomorrow and finalise terms on a transfer for a fee thought to be in the region of \u00a312m. City are expected to be the Premier League's biggest spenders in the transfer window and Bridge was among more than 60 rumoured targets detailed in today's Guardian. The Blackburn Rovers striker Roque Santa Cruz has been widely expected to join his former manager at Eastlands, but Bridge may well beat the Paraguayan to the club. Bridge, 28, spent the first five years of his career at Southampton, where he made 151 appearances, before joining Chelsea in 2003. He has made 87 appearances in blue during his five years in London, but was loaned to Fulham in 2006 after Cole's arrival at Stamford Bridge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
