The Aboriginal youth justice taskforce, announced in 2018 by the premier, Daniel Andrews, will examine the cases of about 250 Aboriginal young people in the youth justice system. Sixteen per cent of children in the youth justice system are Indigenous, even though they make up only 0.7% of the state\u2019s population, and 1.6% of 10 to 19-year-olds. A 2017 Victorian government review found that over-representation is caused by intergenerational trauma, broken connection to country and community, over-policing, not enough focus on diversion and exclusion from mainstream culture. Parallel to the taskforce, the commissioner for Aboriginal children and young people, Justin Mohamed, is conducting the \u201cOur youth, our way\u201d inquiry. \u201cIt\u2019s broader than justice,\u201d Mohamed, a Gooreng Gooreng man originally from Bundaberg in Queensland, said. \u201cWe are looking at the things that make our young people resilient.\u201d Mohamed will have four months to hold 13 regional forums in Victoria, \u201cpulling together local service providers, police, courts, Aboriginal organisations \u2026 We\u2019ll present a picture of what that region looks like, in terms of the cycle of offending, and we\u2019ll start building a plan for that region, to have a focus on Aboriginal young people. \u201cOur team will [look at] the two bookends of this: how do we reduce young people coming into contact with the youth justice in the first place, and how do we stop the reoffending numbers?\u201d Around 65% of young people with a youth justice order are reoffenders, Mohamed said. \u201cThe idea is to get to the communities, because we know the answers lie within community and we want those communities to be heard,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need to hear the voices of those young people.\u201d The first hearings were held in Warrnambool and Framlingham last week. \u201cWarrnambool has one of lowest rates of young Aboriginal people offending,\u201d Mohamed said, citing cultural engagement of children from an early age as a protective factor against offending. \u201cCultural engagement is the stabiliser within a lot of the programs being run. It\u2019s the reason why the region\u2019s [offending] numbers are so low. The commissioner will travel to Ballarat next, with other regions to follow. \u201cWe\u2019ll be hearing from young people what they think is working, about a lot of services that are supposed to be there to protect our young people,\u201d Mohamed said. \u201cHow are young people valued and supported, what are the social norms of those communities, how is racism working? It may not just because young people in that region want to do bad things. \u201cWe want to create a safe space for them to have their views, and not something that makes their lives more difficult. Like most things around youth engagement, having young people as part of the planning process hasn\u2019t always been done in the best way.\u201d The report will be tabled in March 2020."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
