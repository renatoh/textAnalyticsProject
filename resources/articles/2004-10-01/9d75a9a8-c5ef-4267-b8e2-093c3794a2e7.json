Ford, the team's owner, has made it clear that those offering to take on the project will need to show they can afford the $150m (\u00a382m) running costs to field the cars through the 19 races which will probably make up next year's world championship season. In a sense, this is cheap at the price. The purchaser will not be obliged to lodge a $48m (\u00a326m) bond with the FIA to prove that it is serious, in addition to all the other expenses involved. Admittedly that bond would have been paid back by the governing body at the rate of $4m a month during the team's first season, but all that Jaguar's buyers will have to do is gain the agreement of their fellow team principals for a change in the team's name. If Jaguar fail to attract a buyer and finally close their doors it will mark the end of Ford's efforts to establish itself as a consistently effective formula one force. Yet there is a paradox here. In 1967 Ford's far-sightedness resulted in a \u00a3100,000 investment with Keith Duckworth's fledgling company to build the Ford Cosworth DFV formula one engine which completely changed the shape of grand prix racing. Suddenly, for only \u00a37,500, a private team could purchase a state-of-the-art formula one engine. It was originally intended for the exclusive use of Colin Chapman's Lotus team, the Ferrari of its time for whom Jim Clark and Graham Hill represented a formidable driving line-up. After the first six months of domination, Ford's director of public affairs, Walter Hayes, who had been a driving force behind the engine programme, told Chapman that the engine would have to be made available to other teams if the sport was not to suffer. With admirable sportsmanship Chapman shrugged and agreed. In 1969 the DFV would power Jackie Stewart to the first of his three world championships at the wheel of a Ken Tyrrell-entered Matra MS80. Thirty years later a Stewart-Ford car would be driven to victory by Johnny Herbert in the European grand prix at N\u00fcrburgring, the penultimate victory by a Ford-engined car followed only by Giancarlo Fisichella's lucky win in Brazil last year in a Jordan. In 1994 Michael Schumacher won his first world championship in a Benetton-Ford B194 after a controversial collision with Damon Hill's Williams during the final race of the season, the Australian grand prix in Adelaide. The singular lack of promotional advertising after this success led Ford's winning campaign to be known as \"the best-kept secret in formula one\". The company's subsequent partnerships were with Sauber (1995-96) and then with the Stewart family team from 1997-99, after which Jackie Stewart and his son Paul sold the team to Ford for about $60m. Thereafter, in an attempt to create an \"English Ferrari\", the team was emotively re-branded as Jaguar, proudly carrying the British racing green livery. A couple of third places by Eddie Irvine was all the team could muster. Racked by management turmoil for much of their five-year history, Jaguar were slimmed down financially by a distant board of directors in Detroit which neither knew nor cared about its company's formula one heritage. Now the axe has fallen and the only remaining question is whether anyone is prepared to pick up Jaguar's fallen standard in an attempt to make a go of it. When the original announcement of Jaguar's sale was made, one Ford director, Richard Parry Jones, made it clear that the company analysts could find \"no compelling case\" for continuing in the formula one business. This is clearly not a view shared by Ford's colleagues in the Grand Prix World Championship, made up of the sport's four leading manufacturers. While Ford shuffles off the formula one stage, the GPWC members, Ferrari, Renault, BMW and DaimlerChrysler, this week endorsed their faith in the future of grand prix racing by announcing firm plans to start a rival series from 2008. That optimism is shared by the Midland Dallara and Dubai formula one teams who plan to make their debuts in 2006. They clearly believe the future prospect of tapping into the sport's $800m annual commercial-rights income stream is well worth the investment. Ford, with a weather eye on its stock values on Wall Street, has reached a different view."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
