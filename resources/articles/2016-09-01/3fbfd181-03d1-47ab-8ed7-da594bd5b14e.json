Farah, the double Olympic champion who is still basking in a golden glow after successfully defending his 5,000m and 10,000m titles in Rio, will end his season at the Newcastle to South Shields half marathon this weekend but the buildup took an unfortunate twist when a Twitter Q&amp;A with the athlete saw the subject of doping raised by users. Farah, 33, has continually faced questions about his coach, Alberto Salazar, and more recently his relationship with Jama Aden \u2013 previously an \u201cunofficial facilitator\u201d to the athlete in 2015 \u2013 who was arrested in Spain in June in connection with a drugs raid. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on the part of Farah. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really affect me,\u201d Farah said of the myriad controversial remarks he received on Twitter. \u201cI work hard at what I do, I try and be honest with people. All you can do in life is be honest. \u201cAs an athlete when you get to a high level there comes a lot of questions. That\u2019s part of it. But I did have some great messages from Sky, people are behind you, so many people cheering for you. \u201cYou have to look at that. But at the same time, as an athlete you just have to focus on your running and do what I can. I know I work hard and make sacrifices, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t achieve what I achieve. I\u2019ll just keep working hard.\u201d Farah will attempt to secure three Great North Run victories in three years on Sunday, hoping to make a smooth transition from the track to the road after two stunning performances in Rio. He still plans to race on the track at next year\u2019s World Championships in London, before potentially turning his attention to the marathon and Tokyo 2020. Farah\u2019s wife, Tania, will also compete in the mass participation run in the north-east this weekend and the Olympic champion said he has been training her hard. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be back here. I am tired mentally, it\u2019s been a long season, but it\u2019s nice to finish at home. I love the quayside, the crowd get behind you and it\u2019s pretty beautiful,\u201d he added. \u201cTania\u2019s excited, she\u2019s excited. She\u2019s been training reasonably well, I\u2019ve been helping her, we\u2019ll see on Sunday. She\u2019s just going to have to go out and enjoy it. But it\u2019s nice for her to experience what I experience, it\u2019s a different level in terms of times but it\u2019s the same course. \u201cSometimes I have to take a couple of steps back. I don\u2019t know why but sometimes I think that what I can do, everyone can do, but they can\u2019t. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve realised. I\u2019ve given her double runs and she\u2019s like, \u2018How is that possible?\u2019\u201d Britain\u2019s Lynsey Sharp has also been on the receiving end of online abuse in recent weeks following comments in the aftermath of the 800m Olympic final, where she finished sixth and recorded a personal best but was beaten by the South African Caster Semenya. Sharp, who will be competing over 500m at the Great North City Games in Newcastle on Saturday, said in Rio that the decision to overturn rules on testosterone suppression made competing against Semenya, and other hyperandrogenic athletes, difficult. \u201cNothing I say is going to please people \u2013 it\u2019s just a lose-lose situation,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cI don\u2019t do this [compete] to get attention on social media. I don\u2019t do this to get people\u2019s praise. I do it because I enjoy it. But it takes away the fun of it so there\u2019s no point in using it [Twitter]. \u201cIt\u2019s been totally blown out of proportion. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not upset about it. I believe what I said was honest. I don\u2019t think it was in any way racist. I didn\u2019t deserve that reaction. It\u2019s not my issue. It\u2019s for the IAAF to deal with.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
