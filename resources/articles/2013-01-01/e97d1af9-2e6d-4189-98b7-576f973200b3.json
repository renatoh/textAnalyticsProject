The Scottish artistic community has been vociferous in its condemnation of their \"anti-English\" views. Can we now expect these same people to be robust in defending Scotland's greatest bard from the smug metropolitan arrogance of the Guardian's editorial In praise of... The end of the world (19 December)? The song Auld Lang Syne is not a \"dirge\". It is a piece of sung poetry that lends itself open to various interpretations. It is this very ambiguity that ensures it is one of the world's best-known songs. The fact that the tune uses a pentatonic scale, common in Asian cultures, has also ensured its popularity far beyond Scotland. Choosing a Beatles song to denigrate Auld Lang Syne is particularly crass. The Beatles had a long, deep and positive relationship with Scotland.
