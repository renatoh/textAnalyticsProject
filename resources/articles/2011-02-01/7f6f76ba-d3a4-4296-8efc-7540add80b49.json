He wants to move to a smaller home with a smaller garden. My brother, who is 49 and employed, has an obsessive disorder, and will not leave home. He will not seek medical advice for his illness and my mother refuses to support Dad in making my brother leave home. Can anyone advise me how to persuade my brother to leave? I have offered support in helping him go, but he will not budge. \u2022 If you would like to respond to this week's problem, please post your comment below.
