The whole 2010 general election changed on the night of Thursday 15 April. It may now stay changed until polling day. Our ICM poll today maps the key elements of this new emerging electoral landscape. The Conservatives, until recently the likely winners on 6 May, now only have 33% support, ensuring a struggle to win enough votes or seats for victory. Labour, previously battling to get on terms with the Tories, have now slumped to 28%, third in votes for the first time since 1983, though strong in seats, courtesy of the first-past-the-post system. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats, given and seizing their chance at last, have surged 10 points into second place. It is possible that what Lord Tebbit yesterday dubbed \"the Clegg bubble\" may burst between now and 6 May, of course. But don't rely on that. It is just as possible that another strong performance in this week's debate will give the Lib Dem wagon another hearty push, send their rivals into tailspins and have Whitehall mandarins scrabbling for Lib Dem telephone numbers. Either way, politics has changed. There is a new electoral reality. And about time too. And doesn't it actually feel rather good? Get used to it. Not just to these new numbers but to what they mean. There has been lots of Lib Dem talk over the years that Britain has three-party politics \u2013 four in Scotland and Wales. Most of the time, it was an exaggeration. The UK reality was closer to two-and-a-half party politics. But this is a genuine three-way contest, at least for now, and with just 17 days left to polling day, the chances of a three-way result are far stronger than they have been for a generation. In spite of the perversities of the electoral system, that makes a hung parliament much more likely, perhaps even probable. Not just any hung parliament, either, but one in which the Liberal Democrats genuinely hold the balance of power and a real moral mandate to dictate partnership terms. Until now, the conventional wisdom has been that a hung parliament means a minority government not a coalition. A result on these figures \u2013 not least in the context of inevitable market fears \u2013 could push the parties much more firmly towards a coalition, perhaps even towards a government of national unity. Get used to it. These figures, or something like them, would mean serious electoral reform can no longer be postponed. Extrapolating from today's ICM poll, Labour could have 275 seats in the House of Commons on the basis of only 28% of the votes. The Conservatives, meanwhile, would have 245 seats from their own 33%. The Liberal Democrats would have a mere 99 seats on the basis of 30%. Such a result would plunge British democracy into crisis. It would be a morally indefensible basis for forming any government other than a coalition whose programme included high priority for an electoral reform to prevent such an unjust result in future. This is now such a serious possibility that Gordon Brown and David Cameron must now make clear where they stand. Each must pledge that, if their party finishes third in the popular vote but with more seats than any other party, they will not attempt to govern alone. Each must also promise that, if governing in a coalition, they will not call a new general election before radical electoral reform \u2013 more radical than the alternative vote \u2013 has been put in place. Get used to it. In itself, this election will not cleanse Britain's broken politics as some have hoped. Its lesson is that the system of MPs' pay and expenses is not the only thing that cannot continue. The way parliament does its business, and the control of the Commons by the government, will have to change too. So, manifestly and urgently, must the unfair electoral system. The dominance of politics by two industrial-era parties is ending as well. As events continue to unfold, the great lesson of the 2010 election may be that, if you want new politics, nothing in the existing system is now sacrosanct."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
