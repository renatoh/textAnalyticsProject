If some of the protection and privacy is necessary, many clubs embrace effective \u201clockdown mode\u201d a little too enthusiastically and David Moyes is suitably concerned about the resultant disconnect between players, supporters and reporters. It explains why, this week, Sunderland\u2019s manager threw open the doors of his club\u2019s magnificently appointed, if slightly windy, training HQ and offered journalists rare \u201caccess all areas\u201d. Managers in charge of struggling clubs \u2013 and Sunderland are bottom of the table, with no Premier League wins and only two points this season \u2013 traditionally adopt siege mentalities but defying convention, Moyes allowed his guests to watch an entire training session as he prepared for Saturday\u2019s fixture at Stoke City. The manager became happily accustomed to staging daily \u201copen training\u201d during his time coaching Real Sociedad in La Liga, and Jermain Defoe is similarly familiar with the concept. The former England striker certainly had no inhibitions about showing off his extraordinary finishing ability \u2013 crowned by one particularly acrobatic volley \u2013 to an enlarged audience. \u201cIt made a difference, in a good way,\u201d Defoe said. \u201cIt was good for the young lads, having people watch lifts players. They do it all the time in Canada and America, in MLS. When I played for Toronto, reporters talk to you in the changing room. You step out of the shower and there\u2019s a couple of women there.\u201d That may be one step too far for Sunderland but a fully clothed Defoe duly seized an opportunity to challenge the north-east\u2019s often deceptively unflattering image. Back in August Moyes \u2013 the club\u2019s seventh manager in five years \u2013 was shocked when several leading British players including Joe Hart, Jack Wilshere and Ryan Mason rejected mooted moves to Wearside. Despite a recent history studded with near constant 11th-hour relegation escapes, he still cannot quite believe that Sunderland\u2019s regular, fanatical, 40,000\u2011plus crowds, top\u2011drawer infrastructure and illustrious past counted for nothing. \u201cI\u2019m a real London boy but I\u2019ve loved living up here,\u201d Defoe said. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed it and embraced it. It\u2019s a nice area. The only difference is that\u2019s it\u2019s colder. Everything else is just an excuse and if you love football, you can\u2019t make excuses. \u201cIf you love playing football, if you want to play in front of amazing fans in a big stadium, at a club with fantastic training facilities then put some tracksuit bottoms on and come and play for Sunderland. Making excuses is a soft way out.\u201d Defoe concedes that he, too, once had \u201ca different perception,\u201d of the north-east. \u201cBut that was before Toronto,\u201d he says. \u201cUntil then I thought it was too cold \u2018up north\u2019. Then I went to Canada. The cold there. Wow. After that, Sunderland\u2019s tropical.\u201d The heat is already on Moyes, with many pundits forecasting relegation. \u201cWe know we have to improve but there\u2019s a long way to go,\u201d Defoe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a situation you want to be in but it\u2019s nothing new to us; maybe other teams would panic more in our position. If the whole team sticks together we\u2019ll be fine. If we win at Stoke, we\u2019re up and running.\u201d The 34-year-old is encouraged by the squad\u2019s surprisingly resilient morale. \u201cThere\u2019s some good characters here. The spirit\u2019s always been good, the spirit\u2019s not the problem.\u201d Quality is a different matter and his efforts to make Sunderland much more than the sum of their parts have sometimes reduced Defoe to on-pitch tears after scoring key goals. \u201cIt\u2019s just the emotion of such important games,\u201d the striker said. \u201cIt\u2019s because we needed the points so bad it was scary. We\u2019ve got a good thing here, relegation would be a shame. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt we have so much more to give, that we can improve and push on. Those times I\u2019ve cried, it\u2019s because it means so much for me to be here and scoring goals. It\u2019s special here.\u201d Moyes is similarly frustrated by his enduring struggle to unlock Sunderland\u2019s potential but Defoe points out that it is still only three months since he succeeded Sam Allardyce and improvements will inevitably be incremental. Significantly, insiders say the Scot is their most \u201chands-on\u201d manager in years and talk of his enthusiasm for breathing new life into this doziest of sleeping giants in much the same way that Rafael Ben\u00edtez is revitalising Newcastle United. Certainly watching Moyes work as the focal point of training \u2013 variously instructing Patrick van Aanholt to \u201ctrack back\u2019 at breakneck speed and shouting \u201clove it\u201d as 14 consecutive passes are registered during an exercise in close control under pressure \u2013 is to see vision and commitment shining through the October gloom. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult,\u201d Defoe said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t just come into a club and make it click overnight. There\u2019s a new way of playing and it was always going to take time to build something. Hopefully the manager will get time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
