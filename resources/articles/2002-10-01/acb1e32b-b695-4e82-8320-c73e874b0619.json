Talks between Gascoigne and his agent Ian Elliott were expected to take place today but Exeter's joint chairman John Russell admitted there had been some problems. \"I think we need an experienced manager and whether Paul could come in as a player-coach is something we need to discuss,\" said Russell. \"He may just want to come here as a player on a short-term contract; our primary aim is to see if we can get him here to play for us at the weekend.\" Graham Rix, Roy McFarland, the Little brothers Brian and Alan, and Kevin Wilson are said to be on the shortlist, along with Smith, who signed Gascoigne at Rangers and Everton, and other former Premiership managers. \"Walter Smith has expressed an interest in the job through an agent. It goes to show the sort of people who are applying,\" added Russell. \"Other ex-Premier League managers have expressed an interest but they have asked for their names not to be released. \"I have been flabbergasted and honoured by some of the names that have applied. We have had 40 applications.\" Exeter, currently 21st in the Third Division, sacked John Cornforth last weekend after only 11 months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
