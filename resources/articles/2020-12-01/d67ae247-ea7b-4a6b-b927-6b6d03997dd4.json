Obama also said he thinks there is an opportunity for more expansive racial dialogue in the US. But his remarks may add to controversy which welled up this week when he said candidates using \u201csnappy\u201d slogans such as Defund the Police risked alienating voters otherwise broadly sympathetic to liberal aims. Defund the Police became a rallying cry on the left this summer, amid national protests for racial justice following the killing by Minneapolis police of George Floyd, an African American man, and similar incidents in Atlanta, Kenosha and elsewhere. Some senior Democratic party figures, including South Carolina congressman James Clyburn, have claimed the call to Defund the Police contributed to disappointing results in Senate, House and state races. Obama is promoting A Promised Land, his memoir of his rise to the White House and first few years in office. Speaking to Snapchat this week, he added his voice to the chorus. \u201cI guess you can use a snappy slogan like \u2018Defund the Police\u2019 but, you know, you lost a big audience the minute you say it \u2013 which makes it a lot less likely that you\u2019re actually going to get the changes you want done,\u201d he said. \u201cThe key is deciding: do you want to actually get something done, or do you want to feel good among the people you already agree with?\u201d In his remarks to PEN America, which will be streamed on Tuesday, Obama contrasted discussions of race in the context of \u201cpolitics and getting votes\u201d with \u201ctruth-telling and the prophetic voice\u201d. Politicians, he said, often need to speak a \u201cuniversal language\u201d as a way to reach voters resistant to more pointed discourse about racial injustice. But he also allowed that the racial upheavals of 2020, coupled with generational change, may herald an era in which race can be discussed in the political realm in less nuanced terms. \u201cWhat I think has changed \u2013 and we saw this this summer \u2013 is, because of people\u2019s witness of George Floyd, because of what seems like a constant stream of irrefutable evidence of excessive force against unarmed Black folks, that I think white America has awakened to certain realities that even 20 years ago they were still resistant to. \u201cThat creates a new opening for a different kind of political conversation.\u201d PEN America will also give an award, for courage, to Darnella Frazier, a young woman who filmed the killing of Floyd. A recent poll by political strategist Douglas Schoen, previously an adviser to Michael Bloomberg, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, found that Democrats should drop references to Defund the Police if they want to be competitive in the next midterm elections, in 2022. \u201cThe data says to me that if the Democrats go the progressive route they can lose the House and the Senate overwhelmingly in 2022,\u201d Schoen told the New York Post. \u201cThe incoming Biden administration has to understand that unless they take a moderate path, that is a likely potential outcome for the Democrats.\u201d Asked if Biden\u2019s victory was a \u201cmandate\u201d for centrist or progressive policies, 62% of respondents to the poll said centrist. The survey also found that Defund the Police hurt the party in down-ballot races, as 35% of voters said the issue made them \u201cless likely to vote for Democrats\u201d while 23% said it made them more likely. Asked if changing the Defund the Police slogan could improve Democrats\u2019 fortunes, Schoen told the Guardian it would not \u201cerase the clear impression the left of the Democratic party has created that the progressives stand for defunding \u2013 no matter how they describe it.\u201d Obama\u2019s comments on the matter have not found support among leading progressives. Legislators including Ilhan Omar, Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush were quick to reject his comments to Snapchat. \u201cIt\u2019s not a slogan,\u201d tweeted Bush. \u201cIt\u2019s a mandate for keeping our people alive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
