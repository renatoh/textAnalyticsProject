The case was the latest in a string of attempts by the party to cast doubt over the validity of drive-through and mail-in voting in the state\u2019s most populous county; last week, the Texas supreme court rejected a similar case from the same plaintiffs. US district judge Andrew Hanen rejected the request to have ballots thrown out, but argued that a higher court could very well agree with the plaintiffs, who said that the tents used for drive-through voting do not qualify as a permanent structure, as mandated by the Texas election code. By Monday evening, the plaintiffs \u2013 three Republicans running for office and a conservative activist \u2013 had already appealed the decision, according to county officials. The fight over drive-through voting in Harris county, an increasingly diverse and Democratic-leaning region that could play a crucial role in flipping the state, has thrown it into the national spotlight during a tight presidential race. Lina Hidalgo, the top elected county official in Harris county, told the Guardian that the plaintiffs \u201csee the writing on the wall, that the electorate is changing in Texas and in Harris county, and they\u2019re terrified\u201d. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly conceivable that if Texas were to go blue, that the path to that would have gone through Harris county, and that that\u2019s behind the force with which they\u2019re trying to invalidate our votes.\u201d This is not the first time elected Republican officials have attempted to make voting harder in Harris county this election. In October, Greg Abbott, the governor, ordered several ballot drop-off sites closed, leaving just one open for the entire county. Hidalgo, the first Latina and first woman to hold the top elected seat in Harris county, chose to massively expand early voting this election cycle, and enacted several pro-voter reforms, including 24-hour voting and allowing voters to cast their ballot from any precinct. She said that drive-through voting will be available on Tuesday, throughout election day, \u201cpending any other court issues\u201d. Meanwhile, Mimi Marziani \u2013 the head of the Texas Civil Rights Project, a non-partisan organization aimed at combating voter suppression \u2013 described the petition to have votes discounted as \u201cseeking to do something unthinkable\u201d. \u201cThis was never about winning in the court of law,\u201d Marziani said in a statement. \u201cIt was about manufacturing chaos and fear, in an antidemocratic attempt to keep voters from turning out.\u201d Early voting has ballooned in Harris county, compared to the last presidential election: over 1.34m votes have been cast in the county so far, surpassing the total number of votes cast in the county in 2016. Under Hidalgo, the county has dramatically increased spending on the election: from $4m in 2016 to over $30m this election cycle. Some of the pro-voter reforms that the county has implemented include 24-hour voting and allowing voters to cast a ballot from any precinct, rather than only at their home precinct \u2013 a first for the county. But carrying out the election has been far from smooth. Before the court hearing on Monday, the Harris county clerk, Chris Hollins, expressed his frustration over the lack of communication and clarification on the election code by the Texas secretary of state in recent weeks. \u201cOur secretary state has a statutory duty to advise and assist county officials in matters of election law,\u201d Hollins said. \u201cIt is bizarre that on an important question like drive-through voting, which the secretary has already advised was OK, that when we\u2019ve now followed up after the attorney general\u2019s statement against drive-through following, they\u2019ve disappeared off the face of the earth and refused to return our phone calls and fulfill their statutory duty.\u201d And even though the court upheld drive-through voting, the confusion over the issue itself could disenfranchise voters, said Anthony Gutierrez \u2013 the executive director of Common Cause, a non-partisan organization dedicated to upholding democracy. He added that these challenges to voter accessibility can be successful in turning away new voters, even if the case is ultimately rejected. \u201cIt\u2019s super clear they want any new people to not be voting in Texas,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand which IDs they need or what the requirements are for vote-by-mail or curbside, it can just be confusing enough that they opt out and decide it seems like a lot of trouble.\u201d Harris county resident Melanie Cosme cast her ballot via drive-through voting during the early voting period. \u201cI decided to vote via drive-through because I wanted a safer option than waiting in lines with others and that was simple,\u201d Cosme said. But when news broke of the state Republicans\u2019 latest efforts to make voting more difficult, Cosme said she was afraid her vote wouldn\u2019t count. \u201cI thought it was ridiculous for the lawmakers to try two times to cancel drive-through votes, especially after voting had already been going on,\u201d Cosme said. \u201cThere was no reason for the votes to be cancelled or invalidated because the process is the same thing as voting in a building. Texas has had so many voter suppression tactics this election, and this was just trying to be another one.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
