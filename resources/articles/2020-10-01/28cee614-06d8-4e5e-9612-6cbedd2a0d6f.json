In a book \u2013 with a foreword written by the former prime minister of New Zealand Helen Clark \u2013 the drugs liberalisation campaign group Transform has sought to set out practical ways to sell the drugs in state-run special pharmacies as an alternative to what it calls the \u201cunwinnable war against drugs\u201d. The book includes a mock-up of what a packet of legal, prescription cocaine would look like, including health warnings, which Transform said could be sold over the counter by specially trained chemists. The book proposes that a specialist regulatory agency, overseen by the government, could license production of the drugs. Only a single adult use dosage of the drugs would be available in unbranded pharma-style plain packaging with highly visible health warnings and risk information. The new regulatory agency would determine prices and there would be a ban on advertising the drugs. The sale would be managed by a state monopoly to minimise profit incentives, which Transform said would only increase sales. Specialist new pharmacies would open under strict controls with vendors trained to offer health and risk-reduction advice to drug users. The book\u2019s authors stressed that sales should be limited to over-18s, with only one dose per purchase. Transform\u2019s chief executive, Dr James Nicholls, said the book\u2019s practical suggestions offered a way out of a war on drugs that had failed for more than 50 years. \u201cOur proposals would take drug supply away from organised crime groups, creating a system that reduces harm rather than increasing it. The status quo can\u2019t continue,\u201d he said. The father of two sons who both died on the same night from adulterated ecstasy supported the move towards a nationalised, publicly controlled supply system for the three stimulant drugs. Ray Lakeman, a campaigner with Anyone\u2019s Child: Families for Safer Drug Control said: \u201cIt\u2019s time to accept drug use happens and find ways to make it safer. I hope this book helps make those reforms a reality.\u201d In the foreword, Clark writes: \u201cAs consensus grows that the \u2018war on drugs\u2019 has failed, so does the need for a frank exploration of the alternatives \u2026 It is essential that we begin a serious discussion on how we regulate stimulants.\u201d Asked whether there were any moves to reconsider the law on drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines, a Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d The Home Office spokesperson added the government remained opposed to legalising cannabis \u201cbecause it is detrimental to health and mental health\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 October 2020.
