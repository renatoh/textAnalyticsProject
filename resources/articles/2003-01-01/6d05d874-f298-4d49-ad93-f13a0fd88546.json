An exquisite new solo album from Ibrahim Ferrer will be released in March, but first comes a far more quirky offering. Mambo Sinuendo features Cooder as producer and guitarist, this time in the company of another wildly eclectic guitar hero, Manuel Galban. Galban first made his name in the 1960s playing with Cuba's most popular vocal group, Los Zafiros. Here, he and Cooder move even further back, to re-explore songs from the 1950s in an uneven, largely instrumental set that is recommended to guitar buffs prepared for a witty dose of edgy easy-listening. The best tracks feature twangy, Duane Eddy-style guitar and driving percussion matched against the lounge melodies, with a burst of controlled discord added on the entertaining Los Twangueros and a tougher R&amp;B riff on the rousing Monte A Dentro. Elsewhere, they drift off into a more predictable reworking of well-worn standards such as Perez Prado's infuriating Patricia, and turn Doris Day's 1954 hit Secret Love into a delicate electric guitar duet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
