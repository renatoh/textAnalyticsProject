Asked on Thursday whether he believed Trump was trying to undermine democracy with his unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud and the attempts to stop the vote count, Morrison pointed to his cordial relationship with the Republican incumbent, and said Australia was not a participant in the presidential election, it was \u201ca partner with the United States\u201d. \u201cWe respect the decisions that the American people make in their democracy and we\u2019ll be patient and we\u2019ll await the outcome of their process,\u201d the prime minister told reporters in Sydney. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to run a commentary on those things and I won\u2019t,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cI work with the president of the United States as the prime minister of Australia, and I enjoy a very productive working relationship with the president, and I will always put Australia\u2019s interest first in that relationship.\u201d Asked by a reporter how concerned he was about the attempt to stop the vote count in one of the greatest democracies in the world, Morrison backed American institutions to weather any political crisis. \u201cThe great thing about the United States, it is a great democracy and it does have great institutions and we have a deep and wide relationship with the United States which is incredibly important to Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are both like-minded and like in so many ways \u2013 our values, our partnerships, economics, security \u2026 and I have great confidence in the democracy of the United States and I have great confidence in their institutions, and the thing about great institutions and democracies is they deal with whatever challenges come, just like our own does.\u201d Morrison pointed to the record voter turnout in the contest as evidence democracy in the US was not imperilled. \u201cA great democracy, having a great election with the greatest turnout it\u2019s ever seen in its history is actually a demonstration of democracy working.\u201d Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, was more direct on Thursday. She said all votes in the contest should be counted, and it was her expectation that would be the case. \u201cThere have been hotly contested and difficult elections in the US before, but those systems and processes that are in place have always ensured that every vote is counted, and they should be, and I\u2019m sure that they will deliver an outcome,\u201d Payne said. \u201cWhat is important is that every vote is counted. And I\u2019m sure that they will be. I\u2019m absolutely confident that they will be.\u201d Trump\u2019s baseless declaration on Wednesday night that there had been electoral fraud in the contest, his call for the vote count to stop, and the foreshadowing of supreme court action, triggered alarm in Australia and around the world. Australia\u2019s shadow foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, rebuked Trump without naming him, and said American voters \u201cdeserve to have their voices heard\u201d. \u201cAmericans have voted in historic numbers in this election,\u201d the Labor senator said. \u201cThey deserve to have their voices heard. The democratic process must be respected, even when it takes time. It\u2019s in Australia\u2019s interest that America remains a credible, stable democracy.\u201d The Labor leader Anthony Albanese adopted a similar diplomatic line about the strength of American institutions to Morrison when he addressed reporters in Sydney on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m very confident that American institutions and, indeed, the American people will come through this,\u201d the Labor leader said. \u201cOf course everyone would like to see results clearly on election night, but often that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d But the Labor leader was more direct on social media. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re the world\u2019s oldest democracy or the world\u2019s youngest, the people\u2019s right to be heard must be respected \u2013 and the democratic process must be allowed to run its course.\u201d \u201cAustralia should always speak out on the democratic values we hold dear.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
