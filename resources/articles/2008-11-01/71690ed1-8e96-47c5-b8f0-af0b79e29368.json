The ice sheets \u2013 which are up to half a mile thick \u2013 are thought to be the planet's largest reserves of water ice outside the polar caps. The discovery of such large quantities of ice is encouraging for Nasa scientists, whose strategy for hunting extraterrestrial life is to follow signs of water. The US space agency's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter used radar echoes to image gentle slopes at the base of cliffs and mountain ridges that have puzzled scientists since they were first photographed by spacecraft in the 1970s. The radar images show that the features contain large amounts of water ice. \"These results are the smoking gun pointing to the presence of large amounts of water ice at these latitudes,\" said Ali Safaeinili at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Writing in the journal Science, the researchers describe how they discovered the glaciers in the Hellas Basin region in the southern hemisphere of Mars. Similar features are known to exist in the northern hemisphere. \"Altogether, these glaciers almost certainly represent the largest reservoir of water ice on Mars that's not in the polar caps. Just one of the features we examined is three times larger than the city of Los Angeles, and up to one-half-mile thick, and there are many more,\" said John Holt at the University of Texas at Austin. \"In addition to their scientific value, they could be a source of water to support future exploration of Mars.\" The rocky debris on top of the glaciers is thought to have protected the ice from vaporising on contact with the thin atmosphere. \"A key question is how did the ice get there in the first place,\" said James Head at Brown University. One theory is that ice sheets are able to spread down to mid-latitudes when the planet tilts dramatically on its axis. The discovery of the hidden glacier came as Nasa announced its shortlist of four landing sites for its next mission to the planet. The Mars Science Laboratory rover is due to blast off in September or October next year. The four landing sites are Eberswalde, where an ancient river once flowed into a lake; a mountain inside the Gale crater, where the rover could investigate clay deposits; the Holden crater; and the Mawrth valley, an apparent flood channel near the Martian highlands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
