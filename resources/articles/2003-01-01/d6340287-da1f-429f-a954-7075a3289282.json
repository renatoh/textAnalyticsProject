Contracts seen by the Guardian confirm the club intends to sell the historic riverside stadium, which has been home to Fulham's since 1896. It would be replaced by a 240,000 sq ft (73,150 sq metres) development likely to be marketed under the Harrods brand. The club has already received a down-payment of \u00a315m on the deal from Fulham River Projects Ltd (FRP) and, if planning permission is granted, work should begin on the development by the autumn of 2005. A club spokesman last night denied the deal meant Fulham would definitely quit the ground for good. \"This is a precautionary move in case we reach a point at which we have to sell Craven Cottage,\" he said, reiterating Fayed's statement of Tuesday. \"The chairman has not misled the fans. As we have repeatedly said we are still actively pursuing an option to redevelop Craven Cottage in a more economical way, and that is our genuine pursuit.\" On Tuesday the spokesman had said the \u00a315m payment was simply for the option to buy the stadium. The deal, which was struck on September 18 last year, states Fulham must \"use all reasonable endeavours to obtain a satisfactory planning permission as soon as practicable\". The document's timetable suggests an application ought to have been made to Hammersmith and Fulham council by December 31 last year. There was no record yesterday of an application having been made. The plans will dismay supporters who have always believed that their team, currently groundsharing with Queen's Park Rangers at Loftus Road, would one day return to a redeveloped Craven Cottage. Five days after the contract was signed, Fayed said: \"Redeveloping Craven Cottage remains our preferred option and priority.\" The contract, lodged with the Land Registry on September 19 2002, outlined \"the demolition of the existing football stadium and other buildings on the property and the construction . . . of residential units comprising not less than 240,000 sq ft of net saleable space\". If planning permission is obtained for any space over the target of 240,000 sq ft mentioned in the contract, the cost of the land will rise by \u00a3160 per sq ft. The contract also states that Fulham Stadium Ltd, the current owner of the ground, \"shall use reasonable endeavours to acquire an alternative site for use by Fulham Football Club as a football stadium\". The Fulham spokesman added last night: \"As you will know the contract is conditional on many things and particularly on planning permission being achieved. It is clearly understood by both parties that unless a suitable site to build a new stadium can be found within the borough then we will not proceed.\" The club has already begun searching for alternative sites outside the borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, and has been in talks with the Chelsea chairman Ken Bates about a possible groundshare at Stamford Bridge. According to the contract the club has agreed to apply for planning permission on behalf of FRP, and to submit an appeal to Hammersmith and Fulham Council if a barrister, Christopher Lockhart-Mummery QC, advises there is a \"better than 50%\" chance of success. The club was granted permission to redevelop Craven Cottage into a 28,000-seat stadium last year but in December announced the scheme had become too expensive to be viable. Two west London architects' practices, ML Design Group and Hamilton Design Group, have been engaged to prepare the residential project along with the planning consultants Planning Perspectives, based in central London. In the hope of satisfying local development regulations, at least 30% of the development is intended to be made up of affordable housing, though FRP and Fulham agree in the document that their aim is to \"work together in a spirit of mutual co-operation to ... maximise the net saleable space and minimise the amount of on-site/affordable housing.\" The contract also contains a clause that would mean FRP would be granted a licence to use the Harrods trade mark should the site be developed. This would allow the flats to be marketed under the Harrods name. It would even authorise workers at the site to wear Harrods branding. Harrods Estates is specified as \"joint agents for worldwide marketing\". The deal between Fayed and FRP has been conducted amid great secrecy. Correspondence between the parties refers to it as \"Project Wisley\". Wisley in Surrey is home to the Royal Horticultural Society Garden and close to Fayed's mansion in Oxted. Little is known about FRP. The company was set up by Forsters Solicitors, a leading property law firm, on September 5 2002. Its only director is Sophie Hamilton, a senior partner at Forsters. Ms Hamilton said she had no personal stake in FRP but declined to comment further. The Craven Cottage development could prove extremely lucrative. Estate agents in the area yesterday predicted that at current prices a two-bedroom flat on the Craven Cottage site would be worth around \u00a3350,000, while penthouses could be sold for in excess of \u00a31m. The plans will have to incorporate two Grade II listed structures; the famous cottage itself that once housed the club offices, and the Stevenage Road stand. According to planning sources at Hammersmith and Fulham council, even if permission is granted to develop the site, there would still be public recreational facilities there. \"There would have to be affordable housing, there would have to be a sporting or recreational facility retained. In short, we would have to get something in return,\" the source said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
