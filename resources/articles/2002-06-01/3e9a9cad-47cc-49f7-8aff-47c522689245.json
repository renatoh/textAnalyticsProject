They can be charming, certainly. But in a largely monotheistic culture, they can also be intolerant of difference. They are religious, superstitious and anarchic. An ancient island race, they are burdened by an insular past, yet alive to change. They imagine they invented sin and indulge themselves with hilarious results at every opportunity. Guilt is an art, confession a pain in the kimono. So, what in God's name makes the Irish tick? If the words flog, dead and horse spring to mind, maybe a latecomer could chip in to revive the 'Great Debate'. St Niall of Quinn, staring at the ceiling one minute, on the midnight phone to Dublin the next, took the cause as far as he could, inspiring more false starts than a Grand National. And still Roy 'Godot' Keane would not show for Mick McCarthy and country. Pity. You can almost picture the reunion. Very master, very prodigal. If Roy had miraculously appeared in Niigata yesterday, he could have availed himself of an alternative theological metaphor. If he'd booked into, say, the Okura Hotel, opened the drawer in, say, room 935 and pulled out, for instance, The Teaching of Buddha, he would have found a diverting entry on, as it happens, page 176. 'There are three kinds of people in the world. The first are those who are like letters carved in rock: they easily give way to anger and retain their angry thoughts for a long time. The second are those who are like letters written in sand: they give way to anger also, but their angry thoughts quickly pass away. The third are those who are like letters written in running water: they do not retain their passing thoughts; they let abuse and uncomfortable gossip pass by unnoticed; their minds are always pure and undisturbed.' Not pointing any fingers here at Roy, no 'McCarthy Witch-hunt!'; Mick could do with some divine help too. Indeed, on Thursday, he spoke to some wise men at the oldest Shinto shrine in Japan. 'We're heading east,' he said, 'which brings good luck, and I'm of sound mind, apparently, so I won't get hurt. Maybe they were just trying to cheer me up.' Others, meanwhile, will wonder where to park either of them, cosmically speaking. Is Mick 'letters carved in rock' or is he a sandman, prepared to forgive? What of 'Rock' Roy: does he retain 'his angry thoughts for a long time'? Surely, he told us last week, that is what Mick does. McCarthy had said in Boston in 1991 that he'd get Keane sooner or later, hadn't he? And does Mick have enough bend in him to be sand? He did, after all, say Roy was 'history'. And, as Francis Fukiyama said, history is history. Who knows? Over to you Buddha. Certainly neither Roy nor Mick are exactly 'letters in running water', letting 'abuse and uncomfortable gossip pass by unnoticed', their minds 'always pure and undisturbed'. Not wishing to appear difficult, but there is one flickering ember that refuses to die: Keane said in a widely read newspaper that, in the infamous meltdown in Saipan, he never questioned his Barnsley-born manager's Irishness. He said the other stuff, but not that. And it was, as everyone commented, the 'Irish question' that did for Keane. But, there were 22 team-mates in that room. If he didn't say it, who would invent such inflammatory details in the first place - and why? If he did say it, he has some gall denying it and deserves everything that has come his way since. There has been some delicate reporting of this emotive issue, and, given the volatile nature of the participants, it must be difficult for those who know them well to remain neutral. A media confidant of McCarthy's said the other day that he is 'a really nice man'. You don't have to be nice to be right though. So, if you will indulge me one final contribution from the fat man, he reckoned there were two 'worldly passions' that bring us all unstuck. 'The first,' he said (on page 160), 'is the passion for analysis and discussion by which people become confused in judgment. The second is the passion for emotional experience by which people's values become confused.' Handcart! To Hell - and make it snappy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
