A message from the Guardian US editor-in-chief: The president of the United States has been impeached. Let\u2019s remind ourselves just what is at stake. To quote from the articles of impeachment: \u201cPresident Trump has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office.\u201d There has never been a more urgent demonstration of the need for an independent press in the US.

Christianity Today, the evangelical Christian magazine founded by televangelist Billy Graham, called for Donald Trump\u2019s removal from office following the president\u2019s impeachment, marking a significant split from what has typically been Trump\u2019s staunch base. Editor-in-chief Mark Galli wrote that \u201cthe facts in this instance are unambiguous: The president of the United States attempted to use his political power to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit one of the president\u2019s political opponents.\u201d \u201cThat is not only a violation of the Constitution; more importantly, it is profoundly immoral,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe believe the impeachment hearings have made it absolutely clear, in a way the Mueller investigation did not, that President Trump has abused his authority for personal gain and betrayed his constitutional oath,\u201d Galli continued. \u201cThe impeachment hearings have illuminated the president\u2019s moral deficiencies for all to see. This damages the institution of the presidency, damages the reputation of our country, and damages both the spirit and the future of our people.\u201d Trump won the 2016 election with 81% of the white Christian evangelical vote, and support of evangelicals like Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University. Evangelical supporters were able to make peace with Trump\u2019s history of marital infidelity and \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d comments with his hard-right court appointments and Supreme Court nominees, but Galli pointed out the hypocrisy of this in his editorial, writing, \u201cthis president has dumbed down the idea of morality in his administration.\u201d \u201cHe has hired and fired a number of people who are now convicted criminals,\u201d Galli wrote. \u201cHe himself has admitted to immoral actions in business and his relationship with women, about which he remains proud. His Twitter feed alone\u2014with its habitual string of mischaracterizations, lies, and slanders\u2014is a near perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused.\u201d Galli noted that Christianity Today typically does not weigh in on politics, but that the magazine wrote a similar editorial in 1998, when Bill Clinton was impeached. \u201cUnfortunately, the words that we applied to Mr. Clinton 20 years ago apply almost perfectly to our current president,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo the many evangelicals who continue to support Mr. Trump in spite of his blackened moral record, we might say this: Remember who you are and whom you serve,\u201d Galli wrote. \u201cConsider how your justification of Mr. Trump influences your witness to your Lord and Savior. Consider what an unbelieving world will say if you continue to brush off Mr. Trump\u2019s immoral words and behavior in the cause of political expediency. If we don\u2019t reverse course now, will anyone take anything we say about justice and righteousness with any seriousness for decades to come?\u201d Bernie Sanders weighs in on Donald Trump\u2019s comments on US Representative John Dingell: \u201cPutin told me.\u201d That\u2019s what a former senior White House official says Donald Trump stated when expressing his theory that Ukraine tried to prevent him from winning the 2016 election, according to the Washington Post. After meeting privately in July 2017 with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, Trump grew more insistent that Ukraine worked to defeat him, according to multiple former officials familiar with his assertions. The president\u2019s intense resistance to the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia systematically interfered in the 2016 campaign \u2014 and the blame he cast instead on a rival country \u2014 led many of his advisers to think that Putin himself helped spur the idea of Ukraine\u2019s culpability, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. Amid speculation that he\u2019ll leave his post to run for Senate, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, gets a new deputy. The Senate voted 90-3 to confirm Stephen Biegun to be the deputy secretary, according to the Associated Press. The position was previously filled by John Sullivan, who was confirmed to be the new ambassador to Russia. Should Pompeo step down to run for Senate in his home state of Kansas next year, Biegun, a former Ford Motor Company executive who currently serves as the US special representative for North Korea, \u201cis widely expected to fill the secretary of state job at least on an interim basis\u201d, the Associated Press reports. Hi all, Vivian Ho on the west coast taking over the blog very briefly before some adults get on national television to yell about things. Let\u2019s keep it calm, OK? The question remains unanswered, as Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet sent articles of impeachment, the formal charges against Trump, to the Senate. Once in the Senate, lawmakers will begin a trial. A major question surrounding that trial is who the impeachment \u201cmanagers\u201d will be. We know they will be House Democrats, but Pelosi declined to say who she would select on Thursday. She also said she is holding on to articles of impeachment until she knows whether there will be a fair trial in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is certain to be adversarial, and delivered a full throated attack on Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation this morning. Notably, he did not defend President Trump on the facts of the case. Incredibly, it\u2019s also the sixth Democratic presidential debate tonight. The new Democratic presidential field, winnowed by party requirements to qualify for televised debates, will be whiter than in months past. A new Iowa poll shows more voters are beginning to dislike b billionaires Tom Steyer and Mike Bloomberg. Steyer will be on stage tonight. And one last thing... The Democrat-led House also approved the renegotiated US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, a win for the Trump administration. The Senate will likely take up the measure in the New Year. More from AP: One day after its historic impeachment votes, the Democratic-led House gave President Donald Trump an overwhelming bipartisan victory Thursday on a renegotiated trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. By a 385-41 vote, the House approved a bill that puts in place terms of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The legislation passed after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her colleagues won key concessions from an administration anxious to pass the trade deal before next year\u2019s election season makes that task more difficult. The deal is projected to have only a modest impact on the economy. But it gives lawmakers from both parties the chance to support an agreement sought by farmers, ranchers and business owners anxious to move past the months of trade tensions that have complicated spending and hiring decisions. The GOP-controlled Senate probably will take up the legislation when members return to Washington after the holidays and after dealing with impeachment. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s speech this morning, which repeatedly invoked the importance of \u201cprecedent,\u201d has prompted a discussion about former US Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland on Twitter. Garland was President Obama\u2019s nominee for Supreme Court, but McConnell refused to hold confirmation hearings, breaking with... ahem, tradition. Anti-impeachment Democrat, Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, has officially switched parties to become a Republican. Here\u2019s more from the Associated Press: President Donald Trump announced Thursday that Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Democrat who broke with his party to vote against Trump\u2019s impeachment, is becoming a Republican. \u201cJeff will be joining the Republican Party,\u201d Trump announced during an Oval Office appearance with Van Drew, who told his staff over the weekend that he would become a Republican. Van Drew on Wednesday voted against the articles of impeachment as a Democrat, a move that aided GOP attempts to depict Democrats as divided on the matter while Republicans voted unanimously against impeachment. \u201cI believe that this is just a better fit for me,\u201d Van Drew said of joining the GOP. Trump announced that he is endorsing Van Drew for reelection, calling him \u201ca tremendous asset for the party.\u201d At this historic moment ... \u2026 a message from the Guardian US editor-in-chief: The president of the United States has been impeached. Let\u2019s remind ourselves what\u2019s at stake. To quote from the articles of impeachment: \u201cPresident Trump has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office.\u201d When a country\u2019s constitutional foundation is under threat it needs robust, independent institutions to help protect it. If ever there was a need for media oversight and public scrutiny it is now. Over the last three years, much of what the Guardian holds dear has been threatened \u2013 democracy, civility, truth. This US administration is establishing new norms of behaviour. Lying is commonplace. Truth is being chased away. But with your help we can continue to keep it center stage. As 2020 approaches, we\u2019re asking our US readers to help us raise $1.5m by early January to support our journalism. We hope you\u2019ll consider making a year-end gift. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. Make a contribution. A conservative radio station canceled a show that made a joke about school shootings. Here is more from the Associated Press: A Denver, Colorado radio station has canceled a scheduled program after one of the hosts said a school shooting would help break up media coverage of impeachment proceedings. Chuck Bonniwell from the show \u201cChuck &amp; Julie\u201d was complaining Tuesday about an abundance of media coverage on the impeachment of President Donald Trump. \u201cYou wish for a nice school shooting to interrupt the monotony,\u201d Bonniwell said. His co-host and wife Julie Hayden immediately reprimanded him and told listeners not to call in. Radio executives immediately canceled the show. KNUS-AM gave an official statement on its website stating that the 1-4 p.m. weekday slot would now feature the Salem Network show America First hosted by Sebastian Gorka. Bonniwell said Wednesday his comment was meant as a joke. \u201cMaking a statement like that is just unbelievable to me, especially our family. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said John Castillo, the father of the high school student killed last May at a high school in suburban Denver when two students opened fire and also wounded eight others. Castillo also told KDVR-TV: \u201cPeople always say they\u2019re sorry - we\u2019re sorry for your loss, sorry for the statement we made - make it your life work to prove it. Do something different. Advocate for good.\u201d KNUS-AM is owned by Salem Media Group, which specializes in Christian and conservative content. Here\u2019s more on what to expect from today\u2019s Democratic presidential candidate debate tonight, from Guardian reporter Sam Levin: Looming over the high-stakes debate are those who won\u2019t be in attendance. The Democratic National Committee said candidates had to hit at least 4% in four national polls or at least 6% in two early-state polls in the weeks leading up to the event in order to qualify. The candidates also had to attract at least 200,000 donors. That leaves no black or Latino candidates among the nearly all-white lineup of Democratic frontrunners. Senator Cory Booker and the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro both failed to qualify for the debate, and Senator Kamala Harris recently ended her campaign amid polling showing her far behind in California, her home state. Also absent from the event will be Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and billionaire who made a late entrance into the race last monthand has poured an estimated $13.5m into TV ads in California. Steyer, the other billionaire in the race, has spent roughly $1.6m on ads in the state. Republicans in Ohio are exploring whether to repeal the death penalty, and Republican State House speaker Larry Householder has provided a description of his deliberations to the Associated Press: Well, I don\u2019t think we want to come back to hanging, and I don\u2019t think shootings would be good,\u201d he said. \u201cElectrocution is sort of off the table. I don\u2019t know what the method would be. It seems like chemical injection is not working out very well for us, so I don\u2019t know what else there is.\u201d State House Republicans are discussing abolition because the drug cocktail used to execute inmates has been difficult to obtain. This is the same state caucus that introduced a bill to make \u201caggravated abortion murder\u201d a capital offense, and would have required doctors to \u201cre-implant\u201d ectopic pregnancies, which is not possible. Former New York City Mayor and billionaire Mike Bloomberg released a plan to fix American healthcare \u201conce and for all\u201d. Just one of the tenets of his plan is to charge retirees $300 per year to receive vision, dental and hearing coverage. Currently, Medicare covers health the majority of health expenses for seniors and the disabled, but exempts those categories. People qualify for Medicare at age 65. Here is more from a 2016 NPR story: What ends up happening is that almost everybody, when they get to be 65, is sort of on their own and they have to pay for dental care out of pocket,\u201d says Dr. Michael Helgeson, chief executive officer of Apple Tree Dental. More than one-third of low-income seniors, or people with incomes of $23,000 or less, have tooth decay NPR reported. At the time the story was published, more than half of all people on Medicare lived with incomes below $26,200. An analysis by Kaiser Family Foundation found 21.4 million seniors live in poverty. The Republican-controlled Senate removed an explicit mention of \u201cwhite nationalists\u201d from screening provision in military spending bill. A new poll suggests Iowans are growing weary of billionaires. The Iowa State University shows a familiar pattern of two tiers of candidates, with billionaires at the bottom. \u201cIowa Democrats have been unwelcoming to [Mike] Bloomberg ever since he announced his candidacy, but the negative opinions of [Tom] Steyer have increased,\u201d said Dave Peterson, a professor and Whitaker Lindgren faculty fellow in political science who organizes the poll. \u201cMany of the respondents seem to think of them as a pair, indicating opposition to the billionaires in the race.\u201d Of the pair, only Steyer will appear on stage tonight. The poll surveyed the attitudes of more than 600 likely Iowa caucus-goers online.

A Democrat in a conservative New Jersey district is expected to announce, after days of reporting, he is officially changing parties. Following on our earlier post about Georgia canceling a small portion of its voter purge, New Jersey restored the voting rights of 80,000 people yesterday. The House has delayed sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate. What if it never sends them? The lawyers are looking at it. Just a few days after Georgia purged 313,000 voters and roughly 4% of electorate from rolls... Pelosi also addressed President Trump\u2019s comments about former US Representative John Dingell, now deceased. \u201cLet us pray for the president,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe president clearly is insecure when it comes to states-persons... Cruelty is not wit, just because he gets a laugh for saying cruel things doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s funny. It\u2019s not funny at all, it\u2019s sad.\u201d Trump said at a rally in Michigan, Dingell\u2019s home state, that Dingell was \u201clooking up\u201d from Hell. At this historic moment ... \u2026 a message from the Guardian US editor-in-chief: The president of the United States has been impeached. Let\u2019s remind ourselves what\u2019s at stake.

The next step in the impeachment proceedings is for House speaker Nancy Pelosi to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, where there will be a trial, and to select \u201cimpeachment managers\u201d from House representatives to present the case to the Senate. She said Thursday she would not announce who might be chosen until terms of the trial are set with the Senate. \u201cWe would hope there would be a fair process just as we would hope they would honor the constitution,\u201d Pelosi said about Senate Republicans. \u201cIt reminded me that our founders, when they wrote the Constitution, they suspected there could be a rogue president. I don\u2019t think they suspected we could have a rogue president and a rogue leader in the senate at the same time,\u201d she said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gets right to the impeachment today: \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d Another familiar talking point from McConnell: While we wait for Speaker Pelosi to come on, here\u2019s a couple more things happening in Washington DC today: White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told Good Morning America daily press briefings are not being held because reporters used it as an opportunity for \u201ctheater\u201d and to \u201csell books\u201d. Grisham\u2019s predecessor stopped daily briefings. Trump ally Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina will not seek reelection \u2013 his name is reportedly being floated for positions inside the administration. Democrats will try to pry voter\u2019s attention from impeachment drama tonight, as they hold a primary debate in Los Angeles. The field is narrowing and getting whiter. We are zooming right into the next speech this morning. At 10:45am ET House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will speak at her weekly press conference. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is speaking now, and making the case for the US Senate to hear from four witnesses for four hours each during the trial. He argued McConnell is trying to block testimony from all witnesses. \u201cIs the president\u2019s case so weak that none of the president\u2019s men can defend him under oath?\u201d said Schumer. \u201cThe nation turns its eyes to the Senate, what will it see?\u201d The president, in the past, has argued he has \u201cabsolute immunity.\u201d \u201cIf the Republicans proceed with the majority leaders\u2019 scheme to sweep these charges under the rug, they will be creating a precedent that will long be remembered as one of the senate\u2019s darkest chapters,\u201d said Schumer. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is now responding to McConnell\u2019s speech... We will bring you live updates here. \u201cHouse Democrats may be too afraid to even transmit their shoddy work product to the Senate,\u201d said McConnell. \u201cLooks like the prosecutors are getting cold feet in front of the entire country, and second guessing whether they want to do to trial.\u201d A message from the Guardian US editor-in-chief: The president of the United States has been impeached. Let\u2019s remind ourselves just what is at stake. To quote from the articles of impeachment: \u201cPresident Trump has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office.\u201d There has never been a more urgent demonstration of the need for an independent press in the US.

Make a contribution. \u201cLong after the partisan fever of this moment has broken the institutional damage will remain,\u201d McConnell argues. McConnell\u2019s speech has broadly argued that the House, by not citing criminal statues, has passed weak articles of impeachment, and that if the Senate convicts the president in a trial it would invite constant impeachment trials. He continued that if \u201cextraordinary tool of last resort could become part of the arms race\u201d of partisanship.\u201d President Trump, he said, is not the first president with a \u201cpopulist streak\u201d and \u201cnot the first to make entrenched elites feel uncomfortable\u201d. Here is more from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: Democrats didn\u2019t have to rush this, but they chose to stick to their political time table at the expense of pursuing more evidence through proper legal channels,\u201d said McConnell. \u201cNobody made Chairman Schiff do this, he chose to.\u201d US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is speaking now and has come out strongly in defense of the president: Democrats, \u201cfinally did what they decided to do a long time ago \u2013 they voted to impeach President Trump,\u201d said McConnell. He called the inquiry \u201cthe most rushed, least thorough and most unfair impeachment inquiry in modern history.\u201d President Trump is the third president in US history to be impeached. US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to begin speaking any moment. You can watch along with us here. Welcome to this epic morning the night after impeachment, US politics watchers. There will be no shortage of action today. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell is about to make an address on the floor. And with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi now threatening to delay sending articles of impeachment to the Senate for the congressional trial of the president, this sets up an immediate, major conflict between the two most powerful figures on Capitol Hill. Stay tuned. In a historic vote last night, the House impeached Donald Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors. But it is unclear exactly how the impeachment process will move forward. Pelosi must formally deliver the articles of impeachment to the Senate for the trial to start, but may be holding on to them until she receives assurances of a fair trial in the Senate. Today is the last day of business in the House before Christmas, with no sign of Pelosi budging. MccConnell announced he will speak on the Senate floor at 9:30am ET. He is known as a master tactician, and has successfully delayed important Democratic initiatives in the past, notably the confirmation hearings of former US Supreme Court Justice Merrick Garland. The Senate is not in session for several weeks. President Trump is already tweeting about the impeachment this morning, and making it known he is counting on the Senate to save his hide."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
