Until last night Ince's successor had not seen him play but Sam Allardyce finally offered him a chance last night and was rewarded with a stunning, tie-winning free-kick which spared Blackburn the embarrassment of a replay. Lifted left-footed over the Blyth wall from about 22 yards and curving imperiously towards the far corner, it devastated the part-time non-leaguers even though it proved to be Villanueva's last kick of the game before he was replaced by Jason Roberts. For long periods, though, Blyth had made a nonsense of the gulf which separates the Blue Square North from the Premier League and could have earned themselves a trip to Ewood Park had their substitute Andrew Wright not volleyed fractionally wide five minutes from time, or had Alex Gildea subsequently not gone similarly close with a header. \"I'm extremely disappointed,\" admitted Harry Dunn, the Blyth manager who also serves as a caretaker at a children's respite home. \"We had a couple of great, late efforts and we even had a taste of a Premier League team putting the balls in the corner towards the end. \"It took a great goal to beat us and I'm extremely proud of the lads. We competed with them and when we really pressed them at the end, they didn't look very comfortable.\" Allardyce appeared simply relieved: \"I'm glad we're not one of the shocks. I'd have got slaughtered if we'd lost. I thought that their volley at the end was in though; it was easier to miss than to score.\" The evening's culture clash was highlighted in the game's preamble. As Robert Dale, the home centre forward, strode towards the players' entrance still dressed in his barman's trousers and swigging from a bottle of Lucozade after completing his shift at a Newcastle pub, Blackburn officials were fretting about the lack of facilities available to their Prozone experts. That chasm seemed less apparent on the pitch, where Blyth took heart from Allardyce's decision to field very much a reserve team. Indeed he found a starting place for Mark Bunn, his third-choice goalkeeper, while leaving most of the better known Rovers faces behind in Lancashire. Allardyce's priority is league survival but despite his insistence that this was a chance to assess players he had not been able to watch since succeeding Ince, this seemed to be flirting with potential ignominy. Nonetheless his side conjured a decent chance when Matt Derbyshire's pass picked out Keith Treacy and the ensuing shot was creditably tipped wide by the commendably assured Mark Bell. After a cautious opening Blyth slowly began asserting themselves though and a poor clearance from Aaron Mokoena left the visitors in defensive disarray. With Bunn having dashed unwisely way off his line, Ged Dalton was offered an inviting opportunity to chip the goalkeeper but proved unequal to it, his effort flying off target. A subsequent, deflected, overhead kick from Derbyshire hit the back of the net but, to Blyth's considerable relief, was rightly disallowed for offside. As half-time passed and the score remained goalless it seemed incredible to reflect that while Dunn's part-timers train only on Tuesdays and Thursdays and earn a basic weekly wage of between \u00a3100 and \u00a3250 from football, even Allardyce's reserves are rich beyond most Blyth fans' wildest imaginations. The 3,445 packing Croft Park were duly delighted to see Richard Pell clear a Vince Grella shot on the line and even more thrilled that Andy Marriner, the referee, did not spot the defender's arguable handball. Although Blackburn had plenty of possession, Dunn's men closed them down and Allardyce was preparing to replace Villanueva with the more aggressive Roberts when the Chilean was fouled by Gildea just outside the area. One elegant swipe of a left boot later Blyth's dreams of a fourth-round date at Sunderland were ruthlessly dashed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
