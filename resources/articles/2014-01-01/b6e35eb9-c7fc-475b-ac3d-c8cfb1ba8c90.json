The simultaneously thin and overdetermined plot follows floppy-haired, charisma-deficient Niko (Tom Schilling) as he perambulates about town. It's a day that starts with him splitting up with a girlfriend and losing his driving license and ends with an elderly drunk (played by Michael Gwisdek, one of the movie's few plus points) recounting painful memories of Kristallnacht. A couple of mildly amusing comedy-of-embarrassment moments click, although the running gag about Niko's frustrated search for a simple cup of coffee feels like student film-writing at its worst. This reaped numerous awards from the German film academy, which really says more about how becalmed their film industry is at the moment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
