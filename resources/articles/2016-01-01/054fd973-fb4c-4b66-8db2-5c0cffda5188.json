Newcastle United\u2019s manager remains in desperate need of a striker and has made it clear that, if a reliable scorer \u2013 or preferably two \u2013 fails to arrive on Tyneside this month, relegation could beckon. Asked if he was doing everything possible with the players at his disposal, McClaren said: \u201cAbsolutely. The most difficult thing is not to get too frustrated. I genuinely think the players are giving everything.\u201d Considering Newcastle are third bottom of the Premier League and Manchester United are visiting on Tuesday night this collective effort is clearly not enough. Although the club have completed the signing of Henri Saivet, a 25-year-old Senegal midfielder, for an undisclosed fee believed to be around \u00a34.5m from Bordeaux, there is a sense that nothing will change unless increased attacking firepower arrives. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d said McClaren, whose side have lost their past four games in all competitions 1-0. \u201cWe\u2019re just not putting the ball in the net. We\u2019re not scoring enough goals to win games.\u201d An obsession with privacy about transfer dealings at St James\u2019 Park stemming from the club\u2019s owner Mike Ashley, dictates that he needs to be extremely circumspect in his public utterances and cannot speak with the freedom which he would perhaps prefer. Asked about reports Newcastle had offered \u00a310m for the Swansea midfielder Jonjo Shelvey, his reply was typical McClaren. \u201cThat I can\u2019t discuss,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of 100 names linked with us. We can\u2019t comment until they\u2019re through the door.\u201d Whoever ends up signing will almost certainly arrive too late to play a significant role in a potentially season- defining week that could have a major impact on McClaren\u2019s job security. The 54-year-old is under severe pressure to collect points from not only the Manchester United game but another home fixture, against West Ham United, on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s a big week,\u201d he acknowledged. Newcastle\u2019s manager can point to a tightened defence and improved overall performances as indicators of progress but the fear is that without someone to support Aleksandar Mitrovic, the young, floundering Serbia centre-foward serving as his sole fit striker, defeats will continue to accumulate. If so, Lee Charnley, the club\u2019s managing director, could see his position come under similar threat. Charnley campaigned to appoint McClaren after Alan Pardew left for Crystal Palace last January and has a vested interest in helping put things right. Newcastle\u2019s apparent second choice for the job was R\u00e9mi Garde, struggling horribly at Aston Villa. But, like McClaren, Garde can point to his club\u2019s policy of buying young players, often from France, as the source of the difficulties. Aware recruitment is a highly sensitive issue, there are signs Charnley has encouraged Mike Ashley to start allowing McClaren some say on transfers, a hint the manager\u2019s position on the club\u2019s board may not be quite as semantic as thought. \u201cI know what\u2019s going on,\u201d maintained McClaren, who is understood to be increasingly voicing his opinions on the need to sign experienced, ideally British, players possessing leadership traits. Whether or not he is being listened to should become apparent at the end of the month. \u201cIf we weren\u2019t doing everything to rectify things, I\u2019d be worried,\u201d he said. \u201cIf people weren\u2019t backing me or trying to, I\u2019d be worried.\u201d The fear is that, should Newcastle disappoint on Tuesday night, the crowd could turn hostile. A foretaste of discontent came when Florian Thauvin, the underachieving \u00a313m winger signed from Marseille last summer, was serenaded with chants of \u2018You\u2019re not fit to wear the shirt\u201d from away fans during Saturday\u2019s FA Cup defeat at Watford. Perhaps fortunately, an ankle injury means Thauvin will miss the next two games. \u201cWe all have sympathy with Florian,\u201d McClaren said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough for him but we\u2019re sticking by him.\u201d He expressed satisfaction with the display at Watford but was reminded that playing well and losing is not great for fragile dressing-room morale. \u201cAbsolutely right,\u201d he said. \u201cHow long before the players don\u2019t keep coming back? How much does their frustration eventually boil over? It\u2019s a good question.\u201d Charnley and Ashley have been warned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
