Writerman \u00b7 Oh come on - Davina would be brilliant - and while we're at it let's change the name to Celebrity Island Discs - take the whole thing up market! starstruck \u00b7 Penelope Keith in character as Margo from The Good Life - she's the only woman in history that could be more condescendingly hideous than Sue \"please don't let anyone know I'm a Brummie\" Lawly. pootie \u00b7 Silvio Berlusconi ... Significant Other \u00b7 Why not use some imagination and create a new programme. Desert Island Discs is badly worn and mainly a vehicle for wannabee nonentities these days. Let us join the 21st century.Terry Lee \u00b7 Hasn't anyone considered Anna Ford? She is free soon, and her dulcet tones and journalistic background would make her ideally placed to present this show.Philip \u00b7 Surely the kids from PopWorld are looking for jobs.Sam \u00b7 Maybe a long shot but what about John Inverdale. I've been impressed with him on Radio 2 this week and he has a very calm interviewing style. Could be worth a punt as he's a good BBC name.themanwhois \u00b7 If the BBC's prediliction for giving extra jobs to anyone from BBC News (Dermot M on BBC2 quiz, N Kaplinsky, er anywhere, Dimbleby Picture of Britain, the sad chap off Breakfast who ended up on Strictly Come Dancing, Fiona Bruce Crimewatch) is anything to go by, it has to be . . . Andrew Marr! davebrubeck \u00b7 what about dale winton? he's a real people person who could add a bit of much needed fizz to the show! robin \u00b7 Karl Pilkington - surely the obvious choice for both BBC people and Guardian readers. nick peters \u00b7 It has to be Sue MacGregor. Her voice was made for radio. Peter Jenkins \u00b7 Clearly me ... I nicked Roy's idea recently for my own radio prog and called it My Perfect Day. I broadcast out of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis in the eastern caribbean and it goes down well. happydollar"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
