Bye! Tomorrow we will have live coverage of: Germany v China at 2pm BST Spain v South Africa at 5pm BST Norway v Nigeria at 8pm BST A satisfying night for the hosts, who were far too strong for the feeble South Koreans. This was the perfect way for France to get their tournament underway, even if it was disappointing to witness such a lack of competitive tension. France were excellent and could have scored more than four. South Korea were lucky only to concede four. That\u2019s your lot! 90 min: There will be three more minutes of misery for South Korea. 86 min: Grace Geyoro replaces Gaetana Thiney; Yeo Min-ji replaces Jung Seol-bin. This is a fantastic goal and a fine way to liven up a dull second half. Henry takes a pass from Le Sommer, drives forward and lets fly from 20 yards with a swerving right-footed shot that whizzes into the left corner. The celebrations are jubilant and wild. They enjoyed that. What a goal! 81 min: Le Sommer just took a heavy blow. She\u2019s limping a bit, but she says she can continue. 78 min: Bussaglia clips one wide from the edge of the area. 77 min: A poor error from Renard, who completely misjudges a high ball, but Lee Mi-na scuffs wide when she was clean through on goal. 74 min: Amel Majri makes way for Eve Perisset. 72 min: Kim Min-jung requires some treatment after a heavy fall. She should be fine. 70 min: South Korea have a shot! Kang Chaerim sends it well over from 20 yards, though. France respond by bringing on Valerie Gauvin for Delphine Cascarino. 69 min: Lee Mina replaces Lee Young-ju. 65 min: Nothing is happening. France appear to have declared. 62 min: Have a look at our shiny Golden Boot graphic. 60 min: I don\u2019t think South Korea have had a shot yet. 57 min: Henry drills a shot straight at Kim Min-jung from 20 yards. 56 min: It\u2019s one-way traffic. No prizes for guessing which way. 53 min: France win a corner on the right. It\u2019s basically a corner. In fact it almost leads to another goal, Majri\u2019s corner headed just wide of the near post by Jung Seol-bin. That was almost an own goal. 50 min: This feels like a question of how many France want to score. South Korea are very much in \u201cit\u2019s still 0-0\u201d and \u201cno matter what happens we do not lose this half\u201d mode. 48 min: \u201cThough the Golden Boot traditionally goes to a fox in the box, maybe Renard from set pieces could be in the running,\u201d Kari Tulinius. \u201cWhat a great header of the ball.\u201d 46 min: France get the second half underway. \u201cGiven that the South Koreans really can\u2019t compete in the air with the French you\u2019d think it\u2019d be pretty obvious to put players on the posts at set pieces to try to react to the result of losing the first header,\u201d David Wall says. \u201cEspecially after the second goal was so easy.\u201d In other news Eden Hazard has completed his move to Real Madrid. A ridiculously lopsided first half draws to a close with France in complete control. See you in 15 minutes. Majri lifts the corner into the middle from the left and Renard rises highest to plant a fine header, her second of the evening, into the right corner. This is so simple. This is laughably one-sided. 45 min+2: France win another corner, Majri\u2019s shot deflected wide. South Korea have been appalling. And... 45 min: There will be two added minutes. 44 min: Bussaglia fires well wide from 25 yards. 39 min: This is a total mismatch. Thiney drives an outswinging corner into the area from the right and the 6ft 1in Renard arrives to blooter a header home. Kim Mung-jin would have ended up in the Seine if she\u2019d tried to get in the way of that. It was also awful defending from Hwang, who just let Renard run off her. They didn\u2019t have to wait long to make up for the VAR disappointment. 34 min: Majri slips a pass through to Le Sommer, who sees a rising drive pushed over at her near post by Kim Min-jung. Nothing comes from the resulting corner. 33 min: France take another short corner and this time Diani\u2019s able to have a shot from the edge of the area. Her effort flies over. 32 min: France keep pressing. Cascarino sees a shot blocked wide for a corner on the right, moments after Thiney almost reached a cross in the six-yard box. 31 min: It\u2019s such a shame that was ruled out. It was a fantastic goal, Renard heading a cross on for Mbock Bathy to crash a volley home from 12 yards. It was such a good finish from the France centre-back, but there\u2019s no fooling the technology these days. After an interminable wait the goal is ruled out for offside against Mbock Bathy, who had one foot in an offside position. They\u2019re checking for offside. They\u2019ve threatened now. 24 min: South Korea appear to have weathered the storm for now. France haven\u2019t properly threatened for a while. 22 min: A corner to France on the right. Marji\u2019s delivery is headed away. But South Korea can\u2019t properly clear their lines. Renard puts the ball back into the area and Mbock Bathy shins an acrobatic overhead kick miles over. 20 min: South Korea win their first corner, Torrent haring back to boot the ball behind. Jung Seol-bin curls it straight into the side-netting. That was appalling. 16 min: South Korea get into France\u2019s half! Give them a round of applause. Unfortunately the move ends when Mbock Bathy bustles Jung Seolbin off the ball. 13 min: France look dangerous every time they go forward. This could get embarrassing. They\u2019re peppering the South Korean goal and are shooting at every opportunity. I\u2019m not sure South Korea have been out of their half yet. 11 min: Le Sommer has now scored in six major tournaments for France. Not a bad record. She also 11 in her last 11 internationals. A simple but well-worked goal. Henry charges down the right, with the South Korean defence completely out of position, and she has the composure to pull a cutback to the brilliant Le Sommer, who clips a rising shot into the roof of the net from close range. What a start for France! This has been coming since the opening ceremony. 8 min: Some of you have emailed why the teams are referred to as France Women and South Korea Women in the score box. I believe it\u2019s down to a technical issue, but clearly it\u2019s not acceptable and is hopefully something that will be resolved for the next game. 7 min: It\u2019s all France. Diani combines with Le Sommer, charging in from the left, but the forward can\u2019t quite enough on her shot from 18 yards and Kim Minjung makes a save down to her right. A goal is surely on the way. 5 min: Torrent charges down the right and sends a cross into the middle. It should be meat and drink for Kim Min-jung, but the goalkeeper flaps at it and is hugely fortunate that the ball bounces off the unwitting Le Sommer and goes wide of the open goal. 3 min: Another surge from France, Diani scheming this time, threatening on the edge of the area, but the forward\u2019s crowded out before she can get a shot away. South Korea are going to have to do a lot of defending. 2 min: France are on the front foot immediately, breaking down the left. The ball\u2019s worked into the box by Majri. A poor clearance comes back to her and she curls not too far wide of the far post. Peep! South Korea, all in white, get the first game of the 2019 World Cup underway. They\u2019re kicking from right to left in the first half, but it\u2019s not long before they concede possession to the French, who are in their deep navy blue. Red socks, in case you were wondering. You were wondering. It\u2019s time for the anthems. The anthems are done. Fifa Gianni beams next to Emmanuel Macron. Here come the teams! The stadium\u2019s packed and they\u2019re greeted by a huge roar as they emerge. Atmosphere rating: feelgood. The teams are in the tunnel. We\u2019ll have football soon! \u201cGood afternoon from Tennessee, where I am experiencing uncertainty for the first time going into a World Cup,\u201d Claire Tuley says. \u201cNot that the USWNT has a divine right to win this thing, but I\u2019ve literally never known life without them making it to the podium. Now our defence is a question mark and everyone is saying this is wide-open tournament, and it\u2019s a bit of an existential crisis. I\u2019m glad that the game is growing in other countries and I love spirited competition, but also I enjoy winning things. Given that they could meet in the quarters and they seem pretty good, I am hoping France does well today since it\u2019s their opening game as hosts, but not too well.\u201d Panic over, they\u2019re showing the opening ceremony now. Jain is singing. As a surprise some planes zoom over the stadium, creating quite the spectacle. The atmosphere\u2019s bubbling nicely. The BBC aren\u2019t showing the opening ceremony! They\u2019re talking informatively about the football instead! This is an outrage! I wanted to watch the experimental dance! Pre-match emails \u201cEvening Jacob,\u201d Simon McMahon says. \u201cThe words \u2018World Cup\u2019 certainly get the heart racing, especially so when you can add \u2018featuring Scotland\u2019, which is not often. I\u2019m hoping the Scottish women can produce one or two memorable moments, and maybe even qualify. After that, you never know. Though you do, with Scotland anyway. But still, here\u2019s to a great tournament.\u201d \u201cI love that the referee\u2019s last name begins with the letters \u2018ump\u2019,\u201d Peter Oh says. \u201cBy that measure alone, she was born to ref! Play ball!\u201d Pre-match reading France: Bouhaddi; Torrent, Mbock Bathy, Renard, Majri; Henry, Thiney, Bussaglia; Cascarino, Diani, Sommer. South Korea: Kim Minjung; Kim Hyerl, Hwang Boram, Kim Doyeon, Jang Selgi; Lee Youngju, Ji So-yun, Cho Sohyun; Kang Yumi, Jung Seolbin, Lee Geummin. Referee: Claudia Umpierrez (Uruguay) These two sides actually met at the 2015 World Cup. France ran out 3-0 winners. Before the game there\u2019ll be an opening ceremony. And who doesn\u2019t love an opening ceremony? We all love an opening ceremony. I am a fan of an opening ceremony. This one will feature a performance from a French singer called Jain. The former French tennis player and grand slam champion is clearly looking forward to the festivities. A newfound appreciation for women\u2019s football would be an even greater turnaround than the deification last year of Gareth Southgate for his feats in charge of the England men\u2019s team. If mass audiences do start to watch women playing top-flight football, the rest \u2013 equitable sponsorship, packed stadiums, decent player salaries, not asking the world\u2019s best forward to twerk \u2013 may follow. Read the rest of Susie Rushton on why we need to show more support for women\u2019s football here. My colleague Suzy Wrack is covering the game from the Parc des Princes. And look, she\u2019s having a great time already. Predictions! Get yer predictions here! Slag off our writers because of their predictions! World. Cup. Placed next to each other, can you think of two better words in the English language? Two words to make you go weak at the knees and feel like all your birthdays have come at once? Perhaps \u201cLove\u201d and \u201cIsland\u201d, I\u2019ll give you that, or \u201cDawson\u2019s\u201d and \u201cCreek\u201d. But no, it\u2019s \u201cWorld\u201d and Cup\u201d. Look, take a moment to feel what happens when I put them together: World Cup. Spooky, right? Make no mistake, this means everything. By now we\u2019re beyond the point where it feels necessary to explain why women\u2019s football matters. Sorry to break it to all the sexists out there, but it\u2019s here, it\u2019s staying and it\u2019s only going to get bigger from this point onwards. The interest in this tournament is going to be enormous, with coverage like never before, and a multitude of compelling storylines ought to attract even more fans to a sport growing in strength all the time. I\u2019ll level with you, chums: I had a bit of a tear in the eye watching that Nike advert last night. That girl ... she was just so ... so ... so ... so inspiring! Hopefully children everywhere will be watching, ready to be captivated and enthralled by a month of non-stop football, and thinking they can change the world for the better. This is expected to be the best women\u2019s World Cup yet \u2013 you\u2019d hope so given that almost one million tickets have already been sold \u2013 and rather brilliantly nobody seems to have any clue which team will achieve sporting immortality by lifting the trophy on 7 July. Twenty-four countries have made it to France (six groups of four, in case you\u2019re wondering), but there\u2019s no widespread agreement on who\u2019s going to win the thing. Our expert writers certainly can\u2019t agree. Some went for England, glorious England, others went for those ominous Germans. Holland, the European champions, can\u2019t be overlooked, and it\u2019s going to take an almighty effort to stop the USA retaining their trophy. Australia are also tipped to go far. Then there\u2019s France, tournament hosts and perennial quarter-finalists. They begin their campaign against South Korea at the Parc des Princes and will be desperate to get off to a flyer. It\u2019s unlikely to be straightforward, though. South Korea have the outstanding Chelsea forward Ji So-yun in their ranks and their squad is crammed with players who won the Under-17 World Cup and also reached the Under-20 World Cup semi-finals in 2010. No wonder Korea\u2019s Golden Generation have designs on pipping Norway and Nigeria to a knockout spot. All of which means it will be interesting to see whether it will help or hinder France to play in front of an expectant home crowd, not least because they can complete a historic double by emulating the success of the men\u2019s team in Russia last year. No pressure. Just one of the many subplots to keep us occupied over the next month. Let\u2019s play!
