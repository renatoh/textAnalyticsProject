And rarely has that attention been so fleeting. From the Horn of Africa to the Great Lakes region to Zimbabwe, one crisis after another flits across front pages and television screens in rapid succession. If it's not refugees, it's hunger and disease. If it's not pirates, it's insurgents. If it's not misgovernance, it's a lack of governance of any kind. Faced by these multiple, fast-moving dramas, western policy \u2013 meaning that of the US, western Europe and the Nordic states \u2013 is beginning to look less like coherent, joined-up strategy and more like ambulance chasing. That may be inevitable when democratically accountable politicians follow a media-driven agenda. No sooner does a visiting minister announce an aid package or a new peace initiative to camera than a sensational new fire breaks out next door and the film crew races off. The evident danger is that, once the spotlight moves away and first-hand international engagement recedes, the conflict or emergency in question also begins to slip from public consciousness, to be forgotten or overtaken by other events. Its main protagonists may remain unreconciled, its root causes unaddressed. In time, it may erupt again, possibly with more devastating effects. Mark Malloch-Brown, Britain's minister for Africa, just returned from a four-day visit to eastern Congo and Rwanda, acknowledges the problem. Speaking in London today, he said Britain, with EU partners, was pursuing a thought-through agenda in the Great Lakes region based on a peace process formulated and agreed in the Nairobi and Goma accords. In the short term the plan involved the demobilising, disarming and reintegration of rival militias. In the longer term, it was about institution-building and economic development. Britain would provide \"niche support\" for an enlarged UN peacekeeping operation, including logistics, advisers, planning and airlift (although not ground troops). It was also allocating \u00a350m over five years to help rebuild the Congolese army and police, he said. Malloch-Brown's visit followed a brief, high-profile tour by David Miliband, the foreign secretary, and his French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner. But since then, Congo's woes have slipped down the agenda. Malloch-Brown said he was conscious that the eastern Congo, recently described in some quarters as Africa's next Rwanda-style genocide, had lost the world's attention in the space of a few weeks, supplanted by tales of piracy off the Somali coast. And with that shift, he warned, the political will to implement Congo's path back to peace might dissipate. \"Political will goes a bit up and down depending on the level of public and media concern. You're very conscious that the wind behind your shoulder ebbs and flows and it's very much driven by the media,\" he said. Malloch-Brown said it would be misleading to lump all Africa's problems together and conclude the whole continent was in crisis. There were many success stories, often unreported by a diminishing number of foreign correspondents. Countries such as Rwanda had achieved strong economic growth and significant progress towards the millennium development goals. Others like Tanzania and Uganda were also doing well. And Kenya had been taken off the \"watch list\" after overcoming problems arising from last winter's disputed general election. At the same time, three ongoing African crises had potential to morph into region-wide conflicts, he said. One was eastern Congo that, if neglected, could draw in neighbouring countries as in the 1990s. Another was Somalia, where rivalrous Ethiopia and Eritrea are already deeply involved. And a third was unresolved conflict in Sudan, principally in Darfur (which has spilled over into Chad). A possibly bigger political crisis looms in Sudan if the international criminal court issues an arrest warrant for genocide and war crimes against Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, as requested by the ICC prosecutor. Malloch-Brown said the court's decision was expected in January or February. A Sudanese official said today that if indicted, Bashir was likely to retaliate by cutting off cooperation with the UN and other western organisations and expelling UN peacekeepers from Darfur and the south. The west's short attention span on matters African is currently exacerbated by dramas closer to home. According to a new report on the financial crisis by the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, the US and European governments have committed approximately $4.1tn to bail out banks and other financial institutions \u2013 45 times the sums spent on development aid last year. Or look at it another way: the Bush administration has earmarked $152.5bn to rescue a single American company, AIG. In contrast, US and European development aid to Africa (and everywhere else) in 2007 totalled $90.7bn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
