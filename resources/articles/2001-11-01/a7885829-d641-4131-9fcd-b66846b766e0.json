Tens of thousands of desperate people have paid smugglers to get them over the mountains and across the border illegally since September 11. The less successful are penned inside Afghanistan. \u00b7 President Bush warns of a nuclear threat from al-Qaida. \"They're seeking chemical, biological and nuclear weapons,\" he says. \"Given the means, our enemies would be a threat to every nation; and, eventually, to civilisation itself.\" \u00b7 The US has dropped devastating \"daisy cutter\" bombs, first used in the Vietnam war, on Taliban positions in northern Afghanistan, the Pentagon says. The BLU-82 is the size of a small car but much heavier - it weighs 6,800kg (15,000 pounds). It is described as the world's heaviest conventional bomb. \u00b7 Thousands of armed Pakistani tribesmen have crossed into Afghanistan to reinforce Taliban trenches to help defend Kabul from an expected ground offensive by the Northern Alliance. \u00b7 Germany is preparing to mobilise almost 4,000 troops for the US campaign in Afghanistan in what is likely to be its most extensive military engagementsince the second world war. \u00b7 The Taliban triumphantly parade the remains of an American helicopter through Kabul, amid conflicting reports that a second US helicopter had crash-landed in Pakistan's remote western desert. \u00b7 The Queen gives her backing to Britain's Muslims in her first public comment on the war against terrorism. Wednesday November 7 \u00b7 US warplanes bomb behind the Kabul front line in an effort to weaken the Taliban defences and allow opposition troops to advance towards the capital. \u00b7 Tony Blair arrives in Washington to urge President George Bush to launch a limited initiative to restart the Middle East peace process, as part of a drive to retain moderate Muslim support for the war against the Taliban. \u00b7 George Bush widens the scope of the battle against Osama bin Laden by targeting Islamic money exchanges in the US and seeking to freeze assets in nine countries. The president also adds 62 organisations and individuals to a list of suspected terrorist associates. \u00b7 Tony Blair rejects a call by the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, to persuade the US to stop dropping cluster bombs on Afghanistan, saying they are \"legal and are necessary in certain circumstances\". \u00b7 Taliban leaders have sanctioned suicide squads to seek and destroy US and Northern Alliance targets in a significant escalation of their resistance to ground assaults, it is claimed. \u00b7 The attacks on US targets culminating in the September 11 suicide hijackings were only a fraction of the onslaught planned by Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida, it emerges. \u00b7 A collapse in the number of overseas visitors coming to Britain since the terrorist attack on the US is reported by the office for national statistics. Thursday November 8 \u00b7 The Afghan opposition says its forces are advancing towards Mazar-i-Sharif, a key city in the north of the country, after capturing four outlying districts. Aided by US airstrikes on Taliban positions, the Northern Alliance says an attack is imminent and claim to have troops within four miles of the city. \u00b7 Britain ratchets up its financial campaign against terrorism by freezing the assets of 46 organisations and 16 individuals suspected of links with terror groups. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, saysthat a further \u00a37m of suspected terrorist assets were frozen in the UK in the last week. \u00b7 British ministers privately express frustration with the US prosecution of the war against terrorism, the first sign of serious differences between London and Washington since the attacks on September 11. \u00b7 A survey in the Washington Post suggests that doubts are growing in the US over the prospect of a protracted conflict in Afghanistan, along with concerns over the Bush government's handling of the bioterrorist threat at home. \u00b7 Tony Blair rejects a call from the Pakistani president to impose a bombing pause in Afghanistan out of respect for the holy month of Ramadan starting on November 17. \u00b7 Key Afghan opposition commanders are on the verge of abandoning the fight against the Taliban because they believe American blunders are destroying the opportunity to spread revolt against the Islamist regime. \u00b7 Italian police have launched a hunt for seven bars of enriched uranium believed to be in the hands of the mafia and which they fear could have been sold to Islamist terrorists. \u00b7 Some of the most powerful figures in the entertainment industry will assemble for a \"war summit\" in Beverly Hills on Sunday to discuss ways of assisting the White House in getting its message across to the world. \u00b7 President George Bush makes a morale-boosting address to the American people, saying life in the US will never be the same again but that \"out of evil can come great good\". Friday November 9 \u00b7 A fierce campaign is under way in Afghanistan for the strategic northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, the Pentagon says. Northern Alliance troops are fighting the Taliban for control of the city, which, if captured, would open up a supply route from Uzbekistan into central Afghanistan. Late at night, the town is abandoned by the Taliban and General Abdul Rashid Dostam, the Northern Alliance commander who once ruled the city as his domain, walks into Mazar virtually unhindered. \u00b7 Three people are killed and four wounded in central Pakistan when police open fire on protesters blocking a railway in a pro-Taliban demonstration. Saturday November 10 \u00b7 The fall of Mazar-i-Sharif has accelerated UN plans to rush food supplies into northern Afghanistan, where more than 2m of the country's most vulnerable people are facing hunger and bitter cold. Sunday November 11 \u00b7 Almost half of Afghanistan is said to be under control of the opposition Northern Alliance. Tthe bewildering speed of the continuing Taliban collapse leads to speculation that alliance troops could soon be at the gates of the capital, Kabul. \u00b7 For the first time in years the barbers of Mazar-i-Sharif are busy. Free from the gaze of soldiers of the Taliban's Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, the city begins to return to a more liberal life. \u00b7 The home secretary, David Blunkett, dismisses \"airy fairy\" fears about civil liberties as he announces plans to detain foreign terrorists indefinitely without a formal public trial. \u00b7 The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, tolls the UN that the Afghan people must be allowed to form a post-Taliban government free of the foreign intervention that has led to decades of bloodshed. Monday November 12 \u00b7 The Northern Alliance claims to have captured Herat - the largest and most important city in western Afghanistan. \u00b7 Urgent efforts are being made to devise a system for creating a legitimate new government for Afghanistan now that the Northern Alliance's military advances in the north make the Taliban's hold on power increasingly precarious. Foreign ministers from the United States and Russia meet their colleagues from Afghanistan's six neighbours in New York to discuss Kabul after the Taliban. \u00b7 There are reports that hundreds of Pakistani pro-Taliban fighters have been systematically massacred in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif after being callously abandoned by retreating Taliban fighters. \u00b7 The capture of the key city of Herat in western Afghanistan puts the Northern Alliance closer than ever before to the Taliban's headquarters in Kandahar. \u00b7 New York reels as a plane carrying 255 people crashes into a residential neighbourhood three minutes after leaving JFK international airport. Fear sweeps across a city already devastated by the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Centre and terrified by deadly anthrax scares. The investigation into the American Airlines crash is likely to focus on establishing whether it was caused by a catastrophic mechanical failure or a maintenance error, aviation safety experts say. \u00b7 The president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, warns that global poverty is breeding terrorism and calls on the west to make good its promises to bridge the gulf between rich and poor nations. \u00b7 Dock workers at a river port in Uzbekistan load thousands of sacks of flour on to river barges as the UN prepares to send huge aid shipments into Mazar-i-Sharif and out to the villages of northern Afghanistan. Tuesday November 13 \u00b7 Northern Alliance troops enter Kabul after Taliban forces flee the Afghan capital. Following four days of swift advances, the Alliance move into the city in trucks loaded with soldiers, armed with rifles and rocket launchers. Eyewitnesses hear sporadic gunfire as Alliance soldiers celebrate their victory over the Islamic militia that ousted them from the capital in 1996. \u00b7 The families of eight foreign aid workers imprisoned in Kabul, have their hopes dashed that their loved ones would be liberated along with the city, after a prison guard says the Taliban had taken the prisoners with them as they fled. \u00b7 There is widespread looting and casual executions of Taliban stragglers, as Northern Alliance forces consolidate their hold on Kabul. \u00b7 The Taliban's extinction within their own southern heartland seems imminent as local Pashtun tribal leaders begin their long awaited revolt and start attacking Taliban positions in and around the city of Kandahar. \u00b7 The Taliban's supreme leader urges his scattered fighters not to behave like headless chickens but to regroup and fight. \u00b7 Pakistan's military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, expresses his dismay that the Northern Alliance had been allowed to seize Kabul and says a UN peacekeeping force should be sent in to stop opposition troops from \"occupying\" the city. \u00b7 The UN announces it is to take over the administration of Kabul and send in an emergency multinational peacekeeping force to prevent a descent into chaos. \u00b7 Any delight the Bush administration feels about the fall of Kabul is tempered by caution, concern about Afghanistan's future and simple bemusement: officials at the White House and Pentagon appear as astonished by the speed of events as everyone else. \u00b7 The government's new anti-terrorist bill is attacked as a cover to smuggle into law draconian new police powers that have little direct connection to the war against terrorism. Wednesday November 14 \u00b7 British soldiers are on 48-hour standby for duty in Kabul and other newly captured Afghan cities. Ministry of Defence officials say that several thousand troops could soon be deployed as a \"stabilising force\" in areas of the country controlled by the Northern Alliance. \u00b7 The Taliban regime is collapsing in Kandahar, the headquarters of the regime's supreme leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar. The claim, by local opposition leaders, follows an earlier report that anti-Taliban forces have seized Kandahar airport. \u00b7 The eight foreign aid workers held by the Taliban on charges of preaching Christianity will be released imminently, according to the son of the Libyan president, Muammar Gadafy. \u00b7 Children are flying kites in the air above Kabul - just one of the signs that the Taliban's brutally repressive regime is over. \u00b7 The first shipments of United Nations aid arrive in northern Afghanistan by river barge from neighbouring Uzbekistan, raising hopes that a safe corridor can be opened for humanitarian supplies. \u00b7 The victorious Northern Alliance gives a foretaste of trouble by insisting that it will take care of security in Afghanistan and that an international peacekeeping force is unnecessary. \u00b7 Tony Blair claims the Taliban have totally collapsed. He signals allied determination to finish the task in Afghanistan with a message to the Afghans reminding them of a $5m bounty on the head of Osama bin Laden. \u00b7 The Taliban says that Osama bin Laden and their own supreme leader Mullah Mohammad Omar are both safe in Afghanistan. \u00b7 Constitutional lawyers and civil liberties groups in the US react with concern to a directive from US president George Bush that allows the use of military courts for the trial of suspected terrorists. \u00b7 Tribal warlords who have spent the past five years in hibernation are swiftly re-emerging to seize control of large swathes of southern Afghanistan - moves that are plunging the country back into the chaotic and feuding pre-Taliban era of the early 90s. \u00b7 Up to 20,000 Taliban fighters trapped in the northern city of Kunduz have to decide whether to surrender to encircling Northern Alliance troops or face almost certain death. \u00b7 A high-ranking Taliban official flees across the border to Pakistan, as infighting begins between warlords for control of the key Afghan city of Jalalabad. Thursday November 15 \u00b7 Eight western aid workers held since August by the Taliban on suspicion of breaching its laws by preaching Christianity speak of their \"miracle\" rescue, secured early today. \u00b7 Mullah Mohammad Omar, the Taliban's supreme leader, dismisses the \"current situation\" in Afghanistan, claiming that what really matters is the destruction of the United States. \u00b7 US warplanes attack tank and troop positions near Kunduz, the final pocket of Taliban resistance in northern Afghanistan. Up to a 100 Taliban tanks and an estimated 40,000 fighters - some drawn from the al-Qaida terrorist group - are trapped in the city and surrounded on all sides by Northern Alliance troops. \u00b7 The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, says he is \"relatively optimistic\" that a stable, broad-based, multi-ethnic government can be formed in Afghanistan. \u00b7 Hundreds of mojahedin fighters exiled in Pakistan cross back into Afghanistan to reclaim the eastern city of Jalalabad for the first time since the Taliban drove them away five years ago. \u00b7 Tribal leaders in southern Afghanistan warn the Northern Alliance to stay out of Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold in the south. \u00b7 Opponents of the US bombing campaign in Afghanistan refuse to eat humble pie, insisting it is still too early to say the Taliban has been routed or that their defeat would leave the world a more stable place. \u00b7 Tony Blair warns his cabinet that the rapid collapse of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan does not mean that the military campaign is over - nor, he says, does it ease the pressure for urgent delivery of the coalition's promise of sustained diplomatic and humanitarian assistance. \u00b7 The United Nations attempt to persuade the triumphant Northern Alliance to share power with other Afghans has been thrown into new uncertainty by the mysterious absence of the alliance's leader, Burhannuddin Rabbani, from Kabul. \u00b7 Time appears to be running out for the touted return to Kabul of Afghanistan's exiled king as the figurehead of a transitional government, despite UN assurances that he remains relevant. \u00b7 It is confirmed that more than 500 Taliban troops were killed in a bloodbath after the capture of the key northern Afghanistan city of Mazar-i-Sharif. \u00b7 A potentially valuable collection of documents found in the abandoned debris of a Kabul house seems to provide evidence about the activities of Afghanistan-based terrorist groups, but has been ignored by western intelligence agencies. Friday November 16 \u00b7 US warplanes pound targets around the Taliban's home base of Kandahar and the city of Kunduz, now the main centres of the militia's strength after a week of retreat. \u00b7 Five British Muslims have been killed fighting for the Taliban in northern Afghanistan, officials of a London-based Islamic militant group say. \u00b7 Terror suspect Osama bin Laden has probably fled Afghanistan and travelled across the border into Pakistan, Iran radio claims today. Saturday November 17 \u00b7 Britain signals its grave concern about the dangers facing coalition forces in Afghanistan, as heavily armed warring factions demanded that foreign troops \"get off our sovereign soil\". \u00b7 Taliban leaders are clinging on to power in their remaining strongholds and pledging they will keep Kandahar, as a Taliban spokesman claims that Osama bin Laden has fled the country. Sunday November 18 \u00b7 The Northern Alliance concedes that it cannot dictate the terms on which the political future of the country will be decided. Dr Abdullah Abdullah, foreign minister of the alliance, drops the demand that the first stage of talks on a future government must take place in the Afghan capital. \u00b7 The Taliban's supreme leader, Mullah Omar, is still in control of his headquarters city of Kandahar in south-eastern Afghanistan. Arguments are said to be raging in his entourage about whether the movement should make a power-sharing deal with other Pashtun tribal and political leaders. \u00b7 After an enforced absence of five years, Afghanistan's few functioning TV sets flicker dustily back to life as Kabul Television resumes transmission. \u00b7 A tense manhunt is going on among the caves and dry river beds of the eastern and central highlands of Afghanistan where elite units of US and British forces believe they are closing in on Osama bin Laden. \u00b7 Thousands - police estimates were 15,000, the Stop the War coalition's 100,000 - come to London from all over Britain to register opposition to the war in Afghanistan. \u00b7 Taliban fighters besieged in Kunduz, their last northern enclave, offer to retreat peacefully if safe passage can be guaranteed by the UN. \u00b7 The new ruler of eastern Afghanistan warns that 1,500 Arab fighters loyal to Osama bin Laden are hiding in the jagged White Mountains around Jalalabad, and says his mojahedin fighters need British or US help to flush them out. \u00b7 A decision to send some British paratroopers to Afghanistan is likely in the next few days, defence sources say. Plans to send thousands of paras and marines have been put on hold amid increasing confusion and uncertainty about what they would do. \u00b7 For the first time since the launch of the international investigation into the suicide attacks on the US, investigators have uncovered what they believe is firm evidence of a more extensive conspiracy. \u00b7 Detectives in Britain have drawn up a list of about 20 Islamist fundamentalist militants who will be arrested and interned once the government's new anti-terrorism law comes into effect. Monday November 19 \u00b7 A report critical of the government's emergency anti-terrorism laws published by an influential Commons committee is expected to fuel Labour backbench dissent when MPs vote on the measures. In the Commons, home secretary David Blunkett, comes under severe pressure to dilute his emergency anti-terrorism bill as 10 Labour MPs join a 74-vote cross-party revolt against his plans to rush the bill through the Commons in just three days. \u00b7 As diplomatic efforts to set up a new Afghan government intensify, US warplanes strike at Taliban positions in Afghanistan's north, east and south. \u00b7 At least four western journalists are missing in Afghanistan after they were stopped by armed men, according to reports today. \u00b7 Hawks in the US administration step up pressure on President Saddam Hussein by claiming he may have covertly developed biological weapons in the past three years. Tuesday November 20 \u00b7 Heavy US B-52 bombers attack Taliban positions around Kunduz, the regime's last stronghold in northern Afghanistan, as an opposition commander says he doubts the defenders of the city will ever give up. Thousands of the Taliban fighters under siege are members of the Egyptian terrorist movement al-Gamaa al-Islamiya (the Islamic Group). \u00b7 The bodies of four journalists are identified by colleagues a day after their convoy was ambushed in a narrow mountain pass on the road to the Afghan capital, Kabul. \u00b7 Only a bare majority of 51% of the British public believe that the allied bombing campaign against the Taliban, including the use of carpet bombing and \"daisy cutters\", has been justified, according to the latest Guardian/ICM poll on the war. \u00b7 Britain's overt military force in Afghanistan may be pulled out, defence sources in London say amid continuing uncertainty about what role, if any, UK troops could play there. \u00b7 The Northern Alliance agree to attend a key meeting in Berlin on Monday to discuss a future government for Afghanistan with other Afghan factions. \u00b7 As Kabul continues to relax a week after the end of the American bombing, the see-saw of war is bringing new and heavier terror to the people of Afghanistan's second city, Kandahar. \u00b7 Tony Blair wins a standing ovation from Germany's ruling Social Democrats after giving a ringing endorsement to the new, more militarily active role assumed by Gerhard Schroder's government since September 11. \u00b7 The international development secretary, Clare Short, criticises the United States for failing to realise its wider international responsibilities, and for not taking the humanitarian aid effort in Afghanistan seriously enough. \u00b7 The US secretary of state, Colin Powell calls for the greater involvement of women in a new Afghanistan during a conference on the reconstruction of the country. \u00b7 The terrorist attacks on the United States have pushed the world economy into its first recession in 20 years, says a leading economic think-tank."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
