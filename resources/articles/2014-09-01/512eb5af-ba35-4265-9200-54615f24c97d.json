Reformed and re-energised, Richardson brings more to the conversation than most. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are a lot of footballers out there who are not stereotypical,\u201d Richardson says, politely defending his peers. While that may well be the case, there was only one Manchester United footballer whose artwork took pride of place in Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s office for years. Quite how Richardson\u2019s \u201clovely painting\u201d \u2013 which is how Ferguson describes it in his autobiography \u2013 ended up in the hands of the former United manager remains a mystery. \u201cOne minute I was in school, the next minute I was in his office and I looked up and saw the picture there. I was quite bemused when I saw it. I was thinking: \u2018How did this get here?\u2019 I didn\u2019t present it to him or anything like that,\u201d Richardson says, smiling. \u201cIt was an abstract picture, I did it in wax. It was of football stadiums all put together. I remember I went to Millwall and took pictures of the stadium and I used bits of that and rearranged it.\u201d A gifted artist at school, as well as a prodigiously talented young footballer, Richardson put his sketch pad away when he turned professional at Old Trafford 12 years ago. Despite plenty of encouragement from his family, he has never used it since. \u201cI do love art and I do love drawing,\u201d the Villa midfielder says. \u201cBut, with art, it\u2019s a thing where if you don\u2019t do it, you lose it very quickly. \u201cI could draw where we are talking now but it wouldn\u2019t be to the level that I know I could do. You look at the guy from Wolves, Jody Craddock \u2026 an unbelievable artist. When I see the stuff he does, I take my hat off to him. He is obviously blessed with a wonderful talent \u2013 and he\u2019s continued it. I didn\u2019t.\u201d Asked if he will follow in Craddock\u2019s footsteps when he retires from football, Richardson gives a response that reveals much about the biggest influence in his life these days. \u201cProbably not,\u201d he says. \u201cI think I would probably go into the church. Obviously I\u2019m a long way off [finishing football] but afterwards I just want to do things for God and whatever that takes me into. If that takes me into my own ministry, or going out there being a missionary, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d A born-again Christian, Richardson speaks with great passion about his faith. \u201cAs a kid, I always went to church with my nan. I went there without really paying much attention but the seeds were planted then,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou could say that my wife [Natalie] was the catalyst for going to church again and it went from there really. \u201cFive years ago I got saved. I\u2019m very open about it because I would like other people to become a Christian as well, just like me. I\u2019m not shy about my beliefs. Obviously I believe in God and I believe you need to be \u2026 I don\u2019t want to go too deep with it but if people wanted me to talk about it I will and I\u2019ll spread the word of the good news.\u201d Sat in a dressing room at Villa\u2019s training ground, Richardson looks, and sounds, like a man totally comfortable in his own skin. As well as thoroughly enjoying his football with Villa, who are second in the Premier League after taking 10 points from a possible 12, the Londoner gives the impression that he could not be in a better place off the field. That level of contentment was not always there in the past, especially towards the end of his time at United in 2007. In a candid address to the congregation at Good Word Ministries church, in Langley Moor, County Durham, two years ago, Richardson revealed how, in his early 20s, money and fame led to him being more interested in nightclubbing, drinking and womanising than his football career. \u201cThat was a church I was going to when I was playing for Sunderland,\u201d Richardson says, recalling his speech. \u201cTo be honest with you, I was very nervous. It was basically me giving my testimony, how I got to that position in my life, and a lot of people came out to listen to it. It was a great day, 30 people got saved, they gave their lives to Jesus, which was magnificent. It was a good day for me as well, letting people know my story.\u201d Richardson nods when asked if he would have approached his time at Old Trafford differently if he could turn back the clock. \u201cYes, of course. Obviously, if I had found God earlier in my life, I might not have been \u2026 I\u2019m not saying I was off the rails; I was playing football and going out with my mates, like everyone else does. But also I\u2019m a firm believer that God\u2019s timing is perfect timing, everything happens for a reason. If I was still in Manchester now I might not have met my wife and had my kids, so I\u2019m very happy.\u201d Villa\u2019s summer signing from Fulham also makes the point that, despite all the talk of what might have been for a player who scored two goals on his England debut in 2005 and won the last of his eight senior caps towards the end of the following year, he still has plenty to offer. \u201cI\u2019m 29 years old, I feel very strong, great fitness-wise. There are a lot of years left in me. So you never know when my time will come to go on and do better things. I\u2019m at a massive club now and I want to do well for Aston Villa. It\u2019s a sleeping giant.\u201d Arguably a victim of his own versatility on occasions in the past, Richardson is enjoying the chance to play regularly in midfield \u2013 the area of the pitch where he believes he can contribute most \u2013 and is genuinely excited to be part of a Villa team enjoying a renaissance after several years in the wilderness. \u201cI remember if you go back to the time when Martin O\u2019Neill was here, the place was rocking then,\u201d he says. \u201cThey had some great players at the time and I don\u2019t see why those times shouldn\u2019t come back.\u201d Indeed, it is measure of how much confidence there is within the squad that Richardson talks about home game against Arsenal \u2013 the club he grew up watching with his father, Clyde, who was a season-ticket holder at Highbury \u2013 as being \u201cvery winnable\u201d. In the Villa dugout will be Keane, a familiar foe to Arsenal and a man whom Richardson has got to know well down the years. Paul Lambert\u2019s assistant was Richardson\u2019s captain at United and the manager who took him to Sunderland from Old Trafford. \u201cRoy, on a personal note, has been an unbelievable character to be around,\u201d Richardson says. \u201cHe\u2019s a born winner. You sit in the changing room now and look at the lads and everyone looks up to Roy when he talks to them, everyone listens.\u201d Richardson also knows what it is like to be on the end of a Keane scolding \u2013 he was one of several criticised in the notorious MUTV video that was never broadcast after the 4-1 defeat against Middlesbrough in 2005. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the interview that didn\u2019t come out. We all watched it. It wasn\u2019t an issue. None of the lads took it personally. It got blown out of proportion,\u201d Richardson says. \u201cI think in that Middlesbrough game I gave a penalty away. I can\u2019t remember what [Keane] said but, whatever it was, he was right.\u201d There is one final question before Richardson heads home to spend some time with his two-year-old and 10\u2011week\u2011old daughters. What are the chances of another Richardson masterpiece appearing on the wall, this time in Lambert\u2019s office? \u201cMaybe I should draw him,\u201d says Richardson, laughing. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see anything up there soon.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
