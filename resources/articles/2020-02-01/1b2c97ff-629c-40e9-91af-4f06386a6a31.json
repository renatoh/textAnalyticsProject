Chinese people from Wuhan have gone everywhere. Do we keep our travel ban in place beyond Saturday?\u201d Turns out a child with crayons might have done a better job than some of the media \u2013 including Nine, the New Daily and news.com.au \u2013 on a University of Southampton population study that identified cities at high risk from the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cThis map shows the movement of 60,000 of the estimated 5 million people who got out of the Chinese city of Wuhan before it was placed into the lockdown,\u201d Armytage said. \u201cIt shows that they have travelled to all parts of the globe.\u201d Only it didn\u2019t. For one thing, most of the traffic was between London and New York, not Wuhan. What the scary red map actually showed was the pattern of global air traffic back in 2010. Southampton population scientist Prof Andrew Tatem, the author of the coronavirus spread study, told Weekly Beast the map used on Sunrise came from a scientific paper he wrote in 2014 \u2013 but was not part of the latest study. It was used to illustrate the extent of global connectivity and mobility through air travel. But not all the blame for the misinformation can be laid at the feet of Sunrise, Nine, news.com.au and the New Daily. The map was posted on Twitter by Tatem\u2019s World Population Project, although it has now been deleted. It was used \u201csimply to illustrate global connectivity through flights nowadays, not as a model of spread\u201d, Tatem said. Parasite unseen Radio broadcaster Ray Hadley is not known as a film critic, and he admits he hasn\u2019t seen Parasite, the South Korean satire which picked up four Oscars on Monday. But that didn\u2019t stop the 2GB morning host pouring scorn on the film\u2019s triumph. Parasite was the first Asian film to win best screenplay, but Hadley preferred a British film, The Gentlemen, which he had seen. \u201cI\u2019ve got an email from a couple of people of South Korean background who tell me the movie\u2019s not very good,\u201d Hadley told his 2GB listeners on the morning after its big win at the Oscars. \u201cNow I haven\u2019t seen it. \u201cI can\u2019t understand how The Gentlemen didn\u2019t get one award because I think it\u2019s one of the best movies I\u2019ve seen in a long long time. \u201cBut apparently it was too politically incorrect and apparently stereotyped certain type of people. It was a really good British flick. \u201cPeople writing to me of a South Korean background say \u2018Ray it\u2019s almost embarrassing that movie won\u2019. Well I haven\u2019t seen it, so I can\u2019t comment.\u201d We\u2019d love to see those emails. Too good to waste Peta Credlin\u2019s bosses at News Corp might want to check that they are getting value for money from the former Liberal staffer, because there is a remarkable similarity between her Friday night editorial on Sky News and her column in the Sunday Telegraph. Sky After Dark pitches Tony Abbott\u2019s former chief of staff as \u201cAustralia\u2019s most sought-out political commentator\u201d, who \u201coffers her razor-sharp political analysis each weeknight\u201d. The razor-sharp commentary appears to run out on a Friday night, because Credlin often doubles up for her second job. On Friday Credlin told Sky viewers, \u201cPlainly, votes were bought to keep Michael McCormack in his job\u201d. On Sunday, fans of Credlin read: \u201cPlainly, votes were bought to keep Michael McCormack in his job.\u201d \u201cThe one Nat to act with real honour was Matt Canavan,\u201d was another line on repeat. The people\u2019s verdict is \u2026 not that clear The Australian showed just how stung it was by criticism of its coverage during the bushfires by publishing not one but two defensive pieces about how many subscribers it has. Guardian Australia reported that throughout the bushfire season the Oz kept up its climate denial commentary and underplayed aspects of the fires, and the New York Times and others had a similar view. The issue further blew up when an employee accused the company of \u201cmisinformation\u201d and diverting attention from climate change during the bushfire crisis in an explosive all-staff email, and when even James Murdoch criticised News Corp\u2019s Australian outlets for their \u201congoing denial\u201d. The Oz took the opportunity of the release of the Nielsen digital news rankings this week to hit back. \u201cAfter a summer of dishonest, distorted and desperate claims by Twitterati, Guardian Australia and The New York Times \u2013 which, despite its scant knowledge of our nation\u2019s conditions, misrepresented The Australian\u2019s coverage of the bushfire disaster \u2013 the people\u2019s verdict is in,\u201d an editorial thundered on Thursday. \u201cEager to experience full, accurate coverage of the disaster, and to understand what it meant for the nation, new readers flocked to The Australian. \u201cOur digital readership surged to more than 2.5 million in January \u2013 the biggest monthly audience ever recorded \u2013 and 19.1 per cent higher than in December. \u201cIn a time of fake news and hysteria, thoughtful Australians opted for factual content and unbiased analysis.\u201d But sadly for the Oz, the newspaper didn\u2019t even crack the top 10 of the Nielsen rankings, coming in 16th behind stablemates the Courier Mail. The big winner was ABC News, which soared into first place for the first time since 2016 with 11m readers. The Guardian held seventh place with 6.511m, a 10.8% rise from December. Miranda\u2019s mega Maga moment Daily Telegraph columnist Miranda Devine has received the highest accolade for articles she has written for the New York Post, where she is on secondment for the US election. None other than Donald Trump has praised Devine for her work \u2013 twice. \u201cI haven\u2019t looked [at Twitter] for a couple of hours but when I did look I\u2019d had something like 1,200 new followers, so that\u2019s pretty good,\u201d Devine told 2GB\u2019s Ben Fordham on the momentous day. \u201cA lot of love from the Maga people!\u201d So thrilled was the Tele that its correspondent was noticed that it commissioned an article about the president\u2019s latest tweet. \u201cMr Trump on Tuesday lauded Ms Devine\u2019s latest article pointing to the President\u2019s boosted approval ratings since the impeachment trial began,\u201d the Tele reported. \u201cThe words of praise come just days after Mr Trump retweeted Ms Devine\u2019s column for The Daily Telegraph last Friday, writing \u201cso true!\u201d, just hours after it was published.\u201d Devine told Fordham on radio she was having an exciting time in the States and there was no shortage of things to write about. She hoped to meet Trump in person, maybe at the 90th birthday party of New York Post columnist Cindy Adams in April, she said. Foxtel targets \u2018binge-conscious consumers\u2019 Foxtel announced another management shake-up this week, promoting two executives \u2013 Les Wigan and Lesley Portwain \u2013 after the departure of chief operating officer Euan Smith. Chief executive Patrick Delaney admitted the business model, which has been under pressure from Netflix, Stan and Amazon Prime, needed a restructure. \u201cWe now have an opportunity to bring forward our plans to reset Foxtel\u2019s operating model,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cThis will involve bringing best-in-class digital technology, including that created for the Kayo Sports streaming platform, across the entire group with the aim of delivering a material improvement in efficiency and customer experience.\u201d At News Corp\u2019s results last week, the global chief executive, Robert Thomson, said Foxtel was developing a streaming service like Kayo Sports, which has been successful in the Australian market. Foxtel\u2019s subscription revenues are down by 11%. \u201cFinally, at Foxtel, we are planning our entertainment OTT product, which is built off the Kayo system, and like Kayo will help maximise the value of existing rights, and reach binge-conscious consumers outside our traditional [base],\u201d he said. ABC uncut? Lobbying the Coalition government for ABC funding has never been easy. But after their excellent work covering the recent bushfires, there was a lot of love for Aunty in the corridors of Canberra this week. So much love Scott Morrison was keen to post a selfie with ABC chair Ita Buttrose who was accompanying her MD David Anderson for talks about reversing the $84m budget cut. Buttrose told the Heywire Regional Summit everyone acknowledges \u201cthe tireless work of the ABC keeping communities informed, connected and supported during the terrible events so many Australians have endured over the summer months\u201d. \u201cAs deputy prime minister Michael McCormack said yesterday, the ABC saved lives,\u201d she said. But is saving lives enough to claw back the funding? \u201cIt was a constructive conversation about the ABC and the valuable services we provide to rural and regional Australia,\u201d an ABC spokesman said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
