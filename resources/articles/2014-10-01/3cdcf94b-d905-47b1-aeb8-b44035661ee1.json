Switch off against CSKA Moscow because of the eerie atmosphere of an empty Arena Khimki on Tuesday evening and elimination could loom. Despite a tally of a single point from their two Group E matches, the match cannot quite be billed as sudden death for City\u2019s Champions League hopes. But it is close. Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s team really must return home with three points to maintain control of their destiny. Fernandinho said: \u201cWe really need six points from the two games with CSKA but it is better that we don\u2019t look too far ahead and just think about the first game here in Moscow and after that think about the game at the Etihad.\u201d Fernandinho watched Bayern Munich\u2019s recent 1-0 win at the Khimki, which was also played behind closed doors, on television and compared it to a \u201ctraining game\u201d. Having twice experienced a match with no crowd \u2013 the last time was in 2005 when playing for Shakhtar Donetsk at San Siro against Internazionale \u2013 the Brazilian understands the challenge ahead. \u201cThe first time was in Brazil and the second time was playing for Shakhtar against Inter in Milan,\u201d he said. \u201cFans were banned from the stadium on both occasions and it is different. You have to keep your concentration on the pitch.\u201d CSKA\u2019s manager Leonid Slutsky believes the Premier League champions will have an advantage from the Uefa punishment given to his team for the behaviour of their fans, repeated racism among it. \u201cIf we were playing at the Etihad Stadium with closed doors, who do you think would have the advantage?\u201d he said. \u201cDefinitely the absence of the audience will affect our game and of course we need our supporters.\u201d Fernandinho said: \u201cThe [Bayern] game looked like a training session and it is very different for the players. The most important thing is the preparation for the game is good and the players keep their concentration from the first minute to the last. \u201cBayern just did a very professional job and I think that is the way we must approach the game because it is a very important game for us if we want to qualify for the knockout stages. We must win it. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be an advantage for us. It is always good when you play away because the [home] fans support their team and it gives you more motivation to play well. I don\u2019t think this [a closed stadium] is good for either team or for football.\u201d After a 5-1 defeat at Roma in the opening game, CSKA\u2019s 1-0 loss to Bayern was something of an improvement, with the German club requiring a Thomas M\u00fcller penalty to win. Yet despite City\u2019s patchy form in the competition, Slutsky says there is no doubt which side should win. \u201cLet\u2019s say, frankly, Manchester City have always been a favourite, not only for the group but the whole Champions League. Manchester City lost the game against Bayern Munich away 1-0 \u2013 it was a tough game,\u201d he said. \u201cManchester City have also done very well this autumn and Manchester City have played against very strong opponents. But let us not forget the victory, 4-1 against Tottenham [on Saturday], that they had. So it means Manchester City are rather strong, rather qualified. \u201cManchester City are one of the best teams in Europe. They are champions of England and have top football players. A minimum value of a player is \u20ac30m. Our task is to do our best to resist this qualified opponent. \u201cWe will try to do our best and the end of the game will tell us how many goals we will be able to score.\u201d Slutsky did not mention the misfiring Yaya Tour\u00e9 when identifying City\u2019s main threats, however. \u201cFirst of all Sergio Ag\u00fcero \u2013 he scored four goals in the last game \u2013 and David Silva,\u201d said the coach. \u201cHe is a player who assists a lot of dangerous passes.\u201d Pellegrini, though, is wary. \u201cCSKA is a big team here, they play attacking football and we have to be focused on our defending if we are to keep a clean sheet,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth teams are important teams in their leagues. We have both signed important players. It is a pity that we cannot play with fans present tomorrow. This is a showpiece for fans. \u201cIt will be a very strange game, with only the players shouting on the pitch,\u201d Pellegrini added. \u201cI had this experience many years ago. We have no option and we must play that way, and many may think the local team will suffer the most damage, but I think the biggest loser is the game of football.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
