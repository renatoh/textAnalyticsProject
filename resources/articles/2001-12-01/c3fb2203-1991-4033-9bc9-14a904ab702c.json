They said the slave trade was coordinated by criminal gangs who often took children from their parents in lieu of debts incurred from being smuggled into the UK. The situation has come to light in the wake of the inquiry into the death of child abuse victim Victoria Climbi\u00e9, who was murdered after being sent from the Ivory Coast to live with her great-aunt. The eight-year-old died at her north Tottenham home in February 2000 after suffering 128 separate injuries. A BBC investigation identified a network of 13 adults who ran a child-trading network in London. One woman in north-west London had acquired 12 children, for each of which she was able to claim \u00a340 a week in benefits. It emerged that three of these had since been taken into care, care orders were out on three more, two had been passed on to a south London woman and two were missing. \"Children are being trafficked and held hostage in lieu of debt repayments and in doing so are being abused, being used as houseboys or servants and younger children are being neglected,\" said an unnamed social worker. \"In my 15-year career in social work, inside and outside London, I have come across it in every place I have worked,\" he said. The social worker added that social service departments lacked the legal powers to investigate cases while the police did not have sufficient resources. Trafficked children could be located through the benefit system, but inspectors were interested only in checking that multiple claims were not being made for the same child and not in whether the child was with its legitimate carer, he claimed. The trafficking network extends to Ireland, making it even more difficult for the authorities to track down the child slaves. \"From a point of view of trying to identify whether these children are being used, it is virtually impossible,\" said an Irish healthworker, who also wished to remain anonymous. \"They disappear and go back to the UK. There is a network between the UK and Ireland.\" Esther Rantzen, founder and chairwoman of Childline, said social services should investigate child-trafficking \"as a matter of urgency\". \"It is quite clear that social workers do have evidence of what is going on and have taken children into care,\" she said. However, Ms Rantzen expressed concern that some social workers were reluctant to pursue possible cases because of \"politically correct\" beliefs that passing children around extended families was simply part of west African culture. Mike Caye, communications director of charity Anti-Slavery International, said legislation was needed to deal with human trafficking for both sexual and labour exploitation. \"Until you get the legislation in place, you can't make it a priority for the police,\" he warned. In a statement, the Home Office said: \"Trafficking of human beings, and particularly children, is an abhorrent practice. \"The UK signed the trafficking protocol of the UN convention on transnational organised crime and there is at European level a draft framework for the definition of trafficking in human beings.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
