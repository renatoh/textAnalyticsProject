The 26-year-old, controversially picked in England\u2019s World Cup squad at the expense of Luther Burrell, said he is looking forward to returning to Australia and his family but, in a column for the Daily Mail, suggests it would have taken him another 18 months to break into the international team as a flanker. \u201cMy decision to leave Bath and move back to Australia was for personal reasons but it was also because I wanted to spend the rest of my career playing the game that\u2019s in my heart,\u201d Burgess wrote. \u201cRugby league is in my heart. I\u2019m looking forward to getting back to Sydney, where I\u2019ll be with my family and playing for the Rabbitohs alongside my brothers again.\u201d Burgess added that it was tough going to the Bath coach, Mike Ford, asking him to be released from his contract early and also apologised to the West Country club\u2019s supporters for leaving \u201ca hole in that team.\u201d He said: \u201cI explained it was that my heart just isn\u2019t in it, and if my heart\u2019s not in it then they won\u2019t get the best performances from me.\u201d Burgess also accused some sections of the media, coaches not involved with England and former players as having an agenda against the team during the World Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
