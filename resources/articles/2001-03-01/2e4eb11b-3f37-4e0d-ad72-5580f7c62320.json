Sven-Goran Eriksson's first England squad of 31 included eight United players, of whom five took the field against Spain. On Saturday only two who did not, Teddy Sheringham and Nicky Butt, played where they ever might for new England. Andy Cole was suspended but Wes Brown was on the bench, Paul Scholes wide on the left, the Nevilles at centre-back and left-back after each played on the right for Eriksson, and David Beckham nowhere. The leader of England's orchestra, left out midweek against Sturm Graz, thus turns up for national duty with his violin out of tune. The last chance to put it right was denied him. It was a golden chance too. Leicester, nursing the embarrassment of their Cup defeat by Wycombe's internet wanderer but still with an eye to Europe, had no one to contest midfield, so did not try. Instead, in defiance of Trafford borough council, they stood up, were counted in defence - eight, sometimes nine, blocking by numbers - and challenged United's wit. It was found wanting. Simon Royce made only two saves, the first after the interval, before he was beaten by a grotesque deflection in the 88th minute. The second goal was a natural sequel, indicating the intense level of Leicester's earlier purpose and the extent to which it had dulled United's play. Ferguson \"was pleased with the passing\" but it was passing that did not hurt on a pitch that will have the Cup semi-finalists Spurs and Arsenal competing for practice space on Hackney Marshes. Too often the approach was pedestrian, ending in a cross that lacked precision or imagination. Dr Willi Railo, the sports psychologist working with England, says \"the main thing is to clean the players' brains\". As Mrs Beeton might say, \"First find them.\" Last month the royal bank opened a unit for footballers on the basis that they have more money than sense. The new royalty was no doubt flattered to think the bank was called Coots. If Peter Taylor, wearing his national coach's hat, thought to give United's England men a taste of trials to come in Tirana, they failed the test, except Scholes when he came inside. He and Denis Irwin, leading the side in his 500th game for United on St Patrick's Day, deserved the victory. Fabien Barthez usually saves his pranks for the game. On Saturday he tweaked a thigh in the warm-up, an injury of convenience that let in Paul Rachubka, 19, from California, for his full debut and let himself out of France's friendly activities. He will, of course, be untwinged for United's next game, at Anfield. As for Ryan Giggs playing for Wales, \"You must be joking,\" spluttered Ferguson. Brooklyn could have done all Rachubka did and would have enabled Daddy to play and be top first-time father. United and England need his first-time vision and fine-tuned passing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
