They were banking on the Briton adding some much needed variety to an event that has become so dominated by African runners that its future is threatened. Since 1995 Radcliffe and Ireland's Sonia O'Sullivan have been the only runners born outside Africa to have won the title in any of the six categories due to be contested in the Parc of Laeken today and tomorrow. The withdrawal of Radcliffe with a hamstring injury and O'Sullivan's absence means the weekend will more resemble an East African championship than a global event. The International Association of Athletics Federations added a 4km race in 1998 because it believed that would give European athletes more opportunity to challenge their African counterparts. But, apart from the first year, when O'Sullivan won, these races have also turned into an African parade. The last non-African to win a medal, male or female, was Radcliffe, runner-up to Ethiopia's Gete Wami in 2001. Ethiopia's Kenenisa Bekele, winner of both the 12km and 4km titles at the previous two championships in Dublin and Lausanne respectively, is favourite to add to his haul by taking a third double. With Radcliffe in Limerick receiving treatment, Ethiopia's Derartu Tulu will be seeking her fourth world title. Her toughest challenge is expected from the defending long-course champion Worknesh Kidane."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
