Law, described by Bradford's chairman Geoffrey Richmond as \"an up-and-coming manager\", led Chesterfield to the Second Division last season but leaves them in 18th place, just above the relegation zone. He has signed a 2-year deal at Valley Parade and succeeds Jim Jefferies, who resigned on Christmas Eve. \"I have always hoped that I would get the chance to take charge of a club like Bradford City and wondered if it would ever come along,\" Law said. \"It has taken two years and I am absolutely delighted.\" Ian Banks, Law's assistant, was named as Chesterfield's caretaker manager but has since been asked by Law to join him at Bradford. He promises a decision today. Steve Smith, Bradford's caretaker, will pick the team for today's trip to Burnley. Law's first match will be Saturday's FA Cup third-round tie at Walsall. Portsmouth's chairman Milan Mandaric has upped the pressure on Graham Rix after six defeats in the past eight games, telling the manager to make more use of the director of football Harry Redknapp. \"We have Harry sitting up in the directors' box and we need to use his expertise more,\" he said. \"Harry has all that Premiership knowledge. That is why I brought him here. Perhaps he can get involved a little more, go down at half-time and discuss ideas with Graham, that sort of thing.\" Redknapp has made little impact since arriving in his \u00a3150,000-a-year post last summer and is reluctant to take a hands-on role while Rix is in charge. Mandaric added of Rix: \"People keep telling me to be patient with him. He has 2 years of his contract remaining but the question is will I be here in 2 years? I feel terrible. The dream is running away from us and at times I feel like packing my bags and going home to America.\" Lee Mills, 31, has joined Coventry from Portsmouth for up to \u00a3250,000 depending on appearances after playing eight games on loan for City, scoring twice. He cost Pompey \u00a31m from Bradford in August 2000. Crystal Palace have completed the signing of Middlesbrough's full-back Curtis Fleming, 33, for \u00a3100,000 and include him in the squad to face Gillingham today. \"I have two goals: one is to get back into the Premiership and the other is to get back into the Republic of Ireland squad,\" he said. Cardiff have appointed Lennie Lawrence, sacked as Grimsby's manager last Friday, as director of football to work alongside the manager Alan Cork. Bristol City have borrowed the Southampton striker Dani Rodrigues, 21, for the rest of the season. The former Charlton striker Carl Leaburn, 32, is likely to be on the bench for QPR at Ashton Gate today after joining on a non-contract basis. Mark Wright is favourite to take charge of the Conference club Chester. The former England defender resigned as Oxford's manager last month after the FA fined him \u00a31,750 and banned him from the touchline for four matches for allegedly making racist remarks to a referee."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
