I\u2019m off to check out the outrage levels in the comment box, for all I know it\u2019s just me and you\u2019re all totally chilled about this absolute travesty. See you next week for more dance-based larks; kick off is at 6.45pm, and don\u2019t forget to wear your poppy as I\u2019ll be checking each and every one of you*. I\u2019m on Twitter @heidistephens if you want to share some love/air your grievances in the meantime. Have a great week! Hx *I really won\u2019t. This has all got quite tearful. I\u2019m still in the denial stage of grief right now. Oh my goodness, Aston and Janette are out. DID NOT see that coming, and right now it feels like a terrible decision. Aston was better on the night, and he\u2019s better overall, and he\u2019s FAR more entertaining. The nation is now denied his final backflip-tastic Showdance, which is frankly upsetting. I need to lie down. Craig decides to save Mollie and AJ (WAIT WHAT???), and Darcey and Bruno both save Aston and Janette (OMG HIGH DRAMA). Which means Shirley has the deciding vote, and she chooses\u2026MOLLIE AND AJ. So can Mollie and AJ fix their wonky Foxtrot from last night night? This is definitely an improvement, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to be enough to save them. Meanwhile Aston and Janette\u2019s Viennese Waltz is still adorable. Can\u2019t believe Craig gave this a four last night. So who is joining Aston and Janette in tonight\u2019s dance off? Joe and Katya are safe, along with Ruth and Anton (oh FFS), Davood and Nadiya (yaaas), and Gemma and Aljaz! Which means MOLLIE AND AJ in the dance off. Not a huge surprise, but at least there\u2019s a good chance Aston and Janette will survive to dance another day. Things I don\u2019t ever need to see in slow motion: Ruth and Anton dry-humping at the end of their Paso. MY EYES. OK apparently Amy was actually Chloe, Sorry, who is Chloe again? Is she one of the spares? Has Darcey got a bet on for how big she can go with the earrings? Tonight\u2019s are dragging on her shoulders. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Welsh warblers The Stereophonics. It\u2019s called Caught By The Wind, and sounds like every other Sterophonics song ever. Still, nice to have a proper band on. Nice dance accompaniment from Neil and Amy too. At least I think it\u2019s Amy, they keep sneaking extra dancers in just to foil me. I\u2019m quite annoyed about Aston being in the bottom two - I know his different take on dances isn\u2019t for everyone, but I love it. His Paso last week was epic. Imagine how amazing his final showdance will be? We NEED to see that. So who is safely through to next week, and who is the first couple in tonight\u2019s dance-off?? Alexandra and Gorka are safe, along with Jonnie and Oti, Debbie and Giovanni and Susan and Kevin (hooray!). First couple in the bottom two: ASTON AND JANETTE. Oooh. OOOOOH. That is not good. But against Ruth and Anton, surely? Last night on Strictly: UTTER MADNESS. A mix of weird and wonderful song choices, some stellar performances and some wonky bits that the judges loved anyway. Shirley and Craig were both in odd moods, and I have no idea what\u2019s going on anymore. Highlights: Davood\u2019s American Smooth, Jonnie getting his groove on, Susan\u2019s joyful Jive, Hula Aljaz, the long-awaited return of training footage. Lowlights: Mollie\u2019s Foxtrot, I\u2019ve Gotta Feeling (that this song is not right for a Tango), Ruth and Anton\u2019s cheese and ham Paso. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in rather fabulous assymetric hot pink, Claudia in some kind of Victorian lace nightie. It\u2019s really ugly. Tonight\u2019s pro dance is a high-sparkle Prince medley, featuring pole dancing and Neil and Katya giving it seriously mood. Also umbrellas, because Purple Rain. Katya is wearing sparkly yellow knickers. Only Gorka could pull off a floral suit and Mr T\u2019s jewellery and still look smoking hot. And we\u2019re off! The opening titles start to make me a bit melancholy at this point in the series, as we remember those we\u2019ve lost. Bring back Chizzy and Rev. Richard. Also the seals. Currently on Countryfile: Gregg Wallace is carving stag beetles into a totem pole. This seal feature has ended very badly. Not even the dashing Stav Danaos giving us the Countryfile Weather can lift my spirits. This is the second week in a row the Countryfile Casual Weatherperson has gone for minimal effort school uniform, and no doubt certain people are current FROTHING that Stav isn\u2019t wearing a poppy. Boo, dead seals. Don\u2019t make me blub, Countryfile baby seal feature. Aww, they\u2019re like puppies. I want one. \u201cSo why does this plant flower at this time of year?\u201d \u201cBecause it\u2019s an autumn plant\u201d. Countryfile blowing my mind this evening. Everyone, apparently there\u2019s a Countryfile Calendar. It\u2019s only nine pounds, and comes with a free pork pie delivered by John Craven. It\u2019s an Autumn Special on Countryfile tonight, which currently involves less rambling and more badgers. Evening all, and welcome back for tonight\u2019s Results Show! Last night\u2019s live show was all a bit\u2026odd, can\u2019t decide if it was being high on Day Nurse or the judges getting mid-season cabin fever. It should be Ruth to go home this evening (that Paso was horrific), but I have a sneaky feeling she\u2019s going to get through on entertainment value, in which case Mollie could be in trouble, or even Gemma. After last week\u2019s Halloween foregone conclusion, I\u2019m well up for some Strictly high drama. Kick off is 7.15pm as usual, so join me then! So that\u2019s IT for tonight\u2019s show \u2013 who could have imagined that Gemma and Aston would end up in the bottom half? Thanks for joining in and making me feel less bleurgh. My (imaginary) votes are off to Jonnie and Oti, Davood and Nadiya and Susan and Kevin \u2013 I reckon maybe Mollie and AJ and Ruth and Anton to be in tonight\u2019s dance off, but there are a few who could be in trouble tonight/tomorrow. I\u2019ll be back at 7.15 tomorrow for the results, so join me then, have a fab evening! Hx Scores: 8,9,9,9 - a total of 35 for Davood and Nadiya. Bruno thought they were like movie stars \u2013 Davood swept us off our feet. Craig wanted more swing and sway, but otherwise he loved it. Darcey loved the control and the transitions into the bum lift \u2013 they bought plenty of Hollywood glamour and it was fabulous. Shirley says something about arms and legs, and offers her congratulations. Nadiya looks glorious, and Davood doesn\u2019t scrub up badly either. This is pure class \u2013 great footwork, lots of swing and sway, exactly the Davood I\u2019ve been waiting for. OOH THAT LIFT! I LOVED that, which means the judges will hate it, because it\u2019s that kind of night. And finally, it\u2019s Davood and Nadiya! This week they\u2019re dancing the American Smooth to \u2018This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)\u2019 by Natalie Cole. Davood is definitely in the danger zone right now \u2013 neither good enough for top scores, or popular enough to score public votes. He needs a really good week to stay safe \u2013 going last will definitely help. Scores: 6,7,8,8 - a total of 29 for Susan and Kevin. Shirley would never let Susan paint her house but she can dance round Shirley\u2019s kitchen any day. Bruno thought Susan was giving it everything, and it had a great pump action and timing. Craig thought it was vast improvement on last week, but a bit flat-footed. Darcey loved the energy and bounce, needed a bit more contraction but definitely Susan\u2019s dance. So this Jive has a Neil Buchanan Art Attack theme, which is nice. Very decent timing from Susan and plenty of attack, and as usual she looks like she\u2019s having an absolute BALL. Kicks and flicks could be sharper, but there\u2019s plenty of Jive content there, and it\u2019s a really decent effort. Enjoyed that very much. Hooray, it\u2019s time for Susan and Kevin! Tonight they\u2019re dancing the Jive to \u2018This Ole House\u2019 by Shakin\u2019 Stevens. Not going to lie, I\u2019m a bit worried about Susan this week. She\u2019s got all the personality, but I suspect her technique is going to be a bit lacking in this Jive and the judges will punish her accordingly. Hopefully it will be so entertaining that nobody will care. Scores: 6,7,7,7 - a total of 27 for Jonnie and Oti. Darcey loved the ease of Jonnie\u2019s Salsa, it made up for the lack of hip rotation. Bruno loved the strength in the lifts and Jonnie had a great groove in the upper body, it just needed to translate to Jonnie\u2019s bottom half. Shirley loved how Jonnie is finding rhythm that suits him, and Craig loved how he showed Oti off and the lifts were spectacular. Is Shirley got beef this evening? She always goes after Darcey, what\u2019s the problem? OK Jonnie\u2019s got his chest out, and all is well with the world *fans self*. He actually looks he\u2019s having a brilliant time in his typically laid-back way, which is a Jonnie I can totally get behind. Footwork not brilliant, but lifts are amazing and I don\u2019t care. Tonight is madness and I really enjoyed that. Following that is Jonnie and Oti! This week they\u2019re dancing the Salsa to \u2018Turn Me On\u2019 by Kevin Lyttle, a dance/reggae banger from 2003 that I absolutely love. I fully expect Oti to give this both barrels, hopefully Jonnie will do likewise, he really needs to start letting all that hair down. Scores: 10, 10, 10, 10 - drink everything you can find. Craig comes out from behind the desk to bow down to Debbie for her amazing Tango. Darcey got tingles down her back, it was extraordinary and she has never seen a Tango like that. Shirley thought it was outstanding and first class. Bruno thought it was a flawless Tango masterclass. See? I know nothing. This has lovely staccato and great Tango legwork from Debbie, but quite stiff and uncomfortable-looking in places, not sure about this at all. Also this version of I\u2019ve Gotta Feeling is an absolute shocker, sounds like dustbin lids being bashed together. Next up it\u2019s Debbie and Giovanni! This week they\u2019re dancing the Tango to \u2018I Gotta Feeling\u2019 by The Black Eyed Peas. To me this feels too much of a bop to be a Tango song, but tonight is showing us that anything is possible if we\u2019re willing to expand our minds, or take mind-expanding substances. I\u2019m on the Day Nurse, so let\u2019s go with it. Scores: 4 (feel the burn Aston),6,6,6 - a total of 22 for Ruth and Anton. Bruno though Anton looked like Manuel from Fawlty Towers \u2013 it was Murder On The Dancefloor. Craig thought it was entertainment, but no technique \u2013 the public might vote for it, but Craig won\u2019t. Darcey thought Ruth came alive, and she loved the stalking kicks \u2013 Ruth is definitely going somewhere*. Shirley reckons there isn\u2019t a household in the UK that didn\u2019t enjoy that. I BEG TO DIFFER. *home, hopefully EAMONN HOLMES DRINK. This takes forever to get into hold, and features very limited actual Paso in the first half, albeit plenty of hammy Frank Spencer acting from Anton. It\u2019s a bit more dressage pony than stamping bull, but some nice arms from Ruth and a half-decent pacy finish. Also OPERA. I do not love a comedy Paso. Never do this again. It\u2019s time for Ruth and Anton! Tonight they\u2019re dancing the Paso Doble to \u2018The Shady Dame From Seville\u2019 by Julie Andrews. This is proper Paso music, but also traditionally played for laughs, so very interested to see if Ruth and Anton decide to give it full Paso drama, or go for high camp. Scores: 4,7,7,7 - a total of 25 for Aston and Janette. Bit harsh, Craig. Shirley thought there was some reasonably good footwork, but it was a bit bouncy in places and not flat enough. Bruno liked the concept but it needed more glide and less edges \u2013 the dance lost the style. Craig thought it had too much attack and lacked grace, and there was too much rise and fall. Darcey thought he lost his energy in hold. Well I liked it. What do I know? So this kicks off with some faffing in a barber\u2019s chair, but once they get into hold it\u2019s rather fabulous \u2013 great rise and fall from Aston, plenty of spinning and lovely control on the final floor spin. All rather unconventional, but what do you expect from an Aston/Janette Viennese Waltz? Also shout out to Hayley on vocals \u2013 that girl has LUNGS. Next up it\u2019s Aston and Janette! This week they\u2019re dancing the Viennese Waltz to \u2018Who\u2019s Loving You\u2019 by The Jackson 5. Love this song, love this pairing, love a Viennese. Not sure about the combination of all three, but hopefully they can bring it. Scores: 5,7,7,7 - total of 26 for Gemma and Aljaz. Not a great week. Darcey thought it was hot to start with, but it got a bit laboured after the lifts. Shirley agrees about the lifts, but Gemma\u2019s foot rotation was good. Bruno thought it was tasty with just the right amount of spice, but Gemma was a little timid in places and she needs to let herself go. Craig thought it looks clunky and heavy and there was no figure 8 rotation in Gemma\u2019s hips \u2013 it needed to be more seamless. Gemma looks entirely fierce, but that first lift was a bit of a mess. It gets better though, with some very decent hip action from Gemma. It does feel a bit like she and Aljaz are at different parties though \u2013 just not enough welly from Gemma, needs more abandon. Just FYI, hula Aljaz is my favourite Aljaz flavour. It\u2019s time for Gemma and Aljaz! Tonight they\u2019re dancing the Salsa to \u2018Sun Comes Up\u2019 by Rudimental ft. James Arthur. This song is a solid gold banger, and I have high hopes that Gemma is a secret Salsa queen. Party dance/Rudimental/Aljaz is just about my favourite combo ever. Scores: 9,9,9,9 - a total of 36 for Joe and Katya. Craig loved it, he thought it was brilliant, although Joe\u2019s left foot didn\u2019t swivel as much as his right. Darcey loved the charm and Joe\u2019s acting was amazing. Shirley says something about DJ dance hall/dark horse Joe, I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about. Imagine Shirley being less coherent than Bruno. So they all loved it. Just me then. So Joe and Katya are toy soldiers, and this is already intensely annoying. There are some timing issues from Joe, but his basic swivel isn\u2019t bad. Just all a bit\u2026wooden \u2013 maybe that\u2019s intentional?? Yeah that was a no from me. Next up it\u2019s Joe and Katya! This week they\u2019re dancing the Charleston to \u2018Alexander\u2019s Ragtime Band\u2019 by Ella Fitzgerald. I have very high hopes for this \u2013 Joe is most comfortable in these performance-led dances and Katya\u2019s choreography is incredible \u2013 remember her banjo-tastic Charleston with Ed Balls last year? Love how Tess pronounces \u201cdrumming corps\u201d as \u201cdrumming corpse\u201d in the VT. Harsh. Scores: 6,7,7,7 - a total of 27 for Mollie and AJ. Bruno thought the first half was beautiful, but there was an incident in one of the turns. Craig agrees there were some balance issues, but it was classy and stylish. Darcey thought it was elegance all the way through, and Shirley was impressed by Mollie\u2019s timing and how she recovered from the wobble. Well this is a charming Foxtrot, although Mollie\u2019s shoulders are still heading north for the winter and she looks a bit stiff. Lovely lift at the end though - the jury is still out on whether these two are doing it. Wearing a poppy on sweaty training gear is ridiculous - if someone from wardrobe has to clip it to your outfit before the cameras start rolling it doesn\u2019t count. Just saying. Next up it\u2019s Mollie and AJ! Tonight they\u2019re dancing the Foxtrot to \u2018Call Me Irresponsible\u2019 by Connie Francis. Last week\u2019s Cha Cha was a bit of a shambles and put Mollie and AJ in the bottom two. What they really need is a classic Foxtrot packed with charm and style that makes us all fall in love with her again. Absolutely no pressure whatsoever. Scores: 9,10,10,10 - 39 for Alexandra and Gorka. Almost had my Lemsip ready then. Shirley doesn\u2019t know where to start, Alexandra\u2019s Cha Cha looked like a professional (because...OK let\u2019s not go there). Bruno loved the precision, cleanliness \u2013 the best Cha Cha this season so far (not hard, to be fair). Craig loved the turnout (whatever that is), and Darcey thought it was flirty and confident, and Alexandra\u2019s hard work has paid off. So, a jazz-themed Cha Cha. Alexandra is all kinds of fabulous, as per usual. Great foot pressure and solid hip action, alongside bags of attitude. These two are sex on legs, absolutely love it. Up first tonight is Alexandra and Gorka! This week they\u2019re dancing the Cha Cha to \u2018I Got The Music In Me\u2019 by Marcia Hines. Having traditionally been a Week 1 ease-you-in-gently dance, the Cha Cha has become the Dance Of Doom this season, with everyone wanging on about how hard it is. But this is Alexandra and Gorka, so I suspect we are about to get an absolute schooling in how the Cha Cha is supposed to be done. Out come the stars \u2013 Anton has gone full matador, and Aston is sporting a giant \u2018fro. Susan and Kevin look like they\u2019re about to do a stint on Rainbow*. *ask your mum TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a gravity-defying black Playboy pantsuit and massive 80s hair, Claudia in sparkly fabulousness. Two poppies present and correct. TOTAL SHOULDER COUNT: two \u2013 both on Claudia. And we\u2019re off! Last week on Strictly: HALLOWEEN SPECIAL. Featuring several treats, a few tricks, one budget dragon and a couple of rotten pumpkins. Mollie and AJ survived the dance-off and we finally said goodbye to Simon and Karen. Friends for life etc. We\u2019ve made it to the halfway point! As is traditional, I started my Christmas shopping today. YAAAAS I had two pointless answers. I win. OK, my pointless final answers: Madagascar, Honduras, St Davids. On tonight\u2019s Pointless, has to be Dave Gorman for the win, surely? He\u2019s one of the cleverest men I know. (For the record, I don\u2019t actually know Dave Gorman, but his wife and I occasionally swap recipes on Twitter, which is kind of the same thing). This week\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo: a swig of Lemsip Max Strength for any occurrence of the following: Shirley mentioning surburbs of Liverpool Incongruous poppy/outfit pairings Firework-based metaphors Mentions of illness (there\u2019s a lot of it about) Four tens Evening all, and welcome to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing Liveblog! We\u2019ve made it to Week 7 and survived the horrors of Halloween, so well done us. Only ten couples remain, which means things are starting to get interesting. Here\u2019s my mid-way review of the remaining runners and riders: Top Tier: Debbie, Alexandra, Aston \u2013 the best dancers on paper, which means the only way the judges won\u2019t put them all through to the final is if two end up in the dance off. On a journey: Gemma, Joe \u2013 my money is on one of these two to take the fourth slot in the final and grab the glitterball. Too little too late: Mollie, Jonnie, Davood \u2013 I love them all, but they\u2019re not improving fast enough to make the top five. Battling for Blackpool: Ruth, Susan \u2013 both of these in danger if they\u2019re in the bottom two, but I think the public will keep Susan in for a few more weeks. Please note that I am somewhat under the weather with a cold this evening, so need everyone in the comment box to make up for any shortfall in sparkle. You know what to do. Kick off tonight is at 6.50pm, so join me under my blanket for some minute-by-minute shenanigans. See you in a bit!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
