These were \u201cthe only objects that broke the monotony of the great white glittering waste that stretches from the Beardmore Glacier Head to the south pole. A light wind was blowing from the south and little whirls of fine snow, as fine as dust, would occasionally sweep round the tents and along the sides of the sledge-runners, streaming away almost like smoke to the northward,\u201d he wrote in his 1921 memoir, South with Scott. \u201cInside the tents breathing heavily were our eight sleeping figures \u2013 in these little canvas shelters soon after 4am the sleepers became restless and occasionally one would wake, glance at one\u2019s watch and doze again. \u201cAt exactly 5am our leader shouted: \u2018Evans\u2019, and both of us with that name replied: \u2018Right-o, sir.\u2019 Immediately all was bustle, we scrambled out of our sleeping bags, only the cook remaining in each tent. The others with frantic haste filled the aluminium cookers with the gritty snow that here lay hard and windswept.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a happy Christmas Day. Five of the party would never return."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
