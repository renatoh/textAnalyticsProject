But if you're salivating over the food, you're missing the point. The film is based on a short story by Danish author Karen Blixen, whose memoirof Out of Africa was famously adapted for the cinema in 1985. In 19th-century Denmark, spinster sisters Filippa (Bodil Kjer) and Martine (Birgitte Federspiel) are honouring the memory of their late father, a stern preacher, by doing good works and hosting prayer groups, having long since rejected the pleasures of love, marriage and children. Into these old women's lives comes a mysterious Frenchwoman, Babette (St\u00e9phane Audran), an acquaintance of a former dejected suitor, a refugee from the French civil war. Babette agrees to work as their cook and housekeeper; and, on coming into a huge amount of money, offers to cook for them and the cantankerous old villagers a sumptuous French banquet. It is as if the portions of everyday sensuality they have refused all their lives are now to be totalled up and paid to them all at once in this remarkable feast, just when they must bid farewell to the world, with all its pleasures and vanities. Twenty-five years on, the story is still charming and beguiling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
