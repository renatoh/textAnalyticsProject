Blatter, 67, who was first elected Fifa president in 1998 and overwhelmingly re-elected last year on the eve of the World Cup finals, has already proposed that future presidential elections should not take place in the same year as the World Cup finals. Handing him an extra year in office from 2006 to 2007 is expected to be rubber-stamped by delegates who will also approve a new set of statutes, which are due to come into force on January 1 2004, the start of Fifa's centenary year. The chief changes include a more succinct wording for Fifa's objectives in the dual aims to improve the game and take it to the world. Greater emphasis is laid on the unifying, educational, humanitarian and cultural effects of football."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
