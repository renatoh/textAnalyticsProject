Here\u2019s a summary of what he\u2019s touched on. Trump says for the moment there will be no further tariffs imposed on China. You can read our full report on this here. The US president says that negotiations about telco giant Huawei will be left to the end of the negotiations with China. In the mean time he has allowed US companies to sell equipment to Huawei. Trump says he hopes to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, tomorrow when he visits the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea. He says it will be a short meeting and he would like to \u201cshake his hand\u201d. Trump said the North Koreans have \u201ccontacted us to say they\u2019d like to do something\u201d. On meeting the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, Trump says the Saudis have been a \u201cterrific ally\u201d of the US but that he was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d about the murder of the Saudi dissident, Jamal Khashoggi. Earlier Trump said the crown prince was doing a \u201cspectacular job\u201d. Asked about former US president Jimmy Carter\u2019s comments that Trump was an \u201cillegitimate president\u201d because of Russian interference in the election, he said he expected that kind of thing from a Democrat, but reiterated that he was in power \u201cnot because of Russia but because of myself\u201d. US-Iran Trump is being asked about calling off the strike on Iran, after ships were hit by mines in the Straights of Hormuz. \u201cWhen we chose certain areas (to strike) ... I asked how many people were going to die.\u201d Trump said he was told it could be 150 people and he said he thought the deaths that a strike might cause were \u201cdisproportionate\u201d, and as result the strike did not happen. Trump says he is leaving the full negotiation over Huawei until the end fo the negotiations with China, but he\u2019s not giving anything more away on that except to say that the negotiations are complex. Trump is now being asked about the deal he has done about Huawei. \u201cUS companies can sell their equipment to Huawei. I am talking about equipment where there is no great national emergency problem with it, but the US companies can sell their equipment, so we have a lot of the great companies in Silicon Valley based in different parts of the country that make extremely complex equipment,\u201d he says. One of the US-based reporters is now asking Trump about the US Democratic debates of potential frontrunners to challenge Trump. He\u2019s been asked if Kamala Harris might be a tough opponent: \u201cYou never know who will be tough. You never know.\u201d Now Trump is talking about Iran. He says he thinks they would like to \u201cdo a deal with the US\u201d. Will it be a bad sign if Kim doesn\u2019t show? Trump says Kim follows him on Twitter. \u201cThey\u2019ve contacted us to say they\u2019d like to do something\u201d Trump says. Trump reiterates that he has great relations with everyone. Trump is asked if he condemned the killing of Saudi dissent writer Jamal Khashoggi. Trump says he thinks what happened to the write was \u201chorrible\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m very unhappy about that whole event,\u201d he says, but adds that \u201cNo one has directly pointed a finger at the future king of Saudi Arabia.\u201d He also says the Kingdom has been a \u201cterrific ally\u201d of the US. He continued: \u201cI am extremely angry and unhappy about anything like that taking place, but as this moment, more than 13 people are being prosecuted and I hear the number is going to be going up but it is a good question.\u201d Trump also says he has a good relationship with President Putin. \u201cYou are going to have to take a look at the words, we had a discussion, we had a great discussion President Putin and myself, I thought it was a tremendous discussion, and he would like to trade with United States and they have great products, rangeland, very rich land and a lot of oil, a of minerals, the things that we like, and I can see trade going on with Russia, we could do fantastically well. We do very little trade with Russia, so I could see positive things happening.\u201d Trump has moved back to President Xi. He says he has a \u201ctremendous\u201d relationship with Xi, and also with Mohammed Bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince. Trump is now being asked about the election and Russia in relation to Jimmy Carter\u2019s comments that Trump was an \u201cillegitimate president\u201d. He was critical of Carter saying he expected that kind of thing from a Democrat. \u201cI won not because of Russia but because of myself. I campaigned harder,\u201d he said. Donald Trump says he did discuss Huawei with China but didn\u2019t talk directly about the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou detained in Canada. Trump goes back to the China trade tariffs. He says of Beijing: \u201cWe\u2019re going to hold on our tariffs. It doesn\u2019t mean that it is going to be a deal, but they would like to make a deal i can tell you that. It would be a very historic event. We\u2019ve never really had a deal with China.\u201d Trump says he may or may not be meeting Kim Jong-un tomorrow. He\u2019s about to start taking questions. The first question is about what China is demanding in return for further tariffs not being imposed and whether he will step across the border into North Korea. He says he would have no problem in doing that. On China, he doesn\u2019t answer the question and talks about the complexity of the trade talks. Trump says that China is going to start consulting with the US on spending money with America farmers: \u201cChina\u2019s going to be buying a tremendous amount of food and agricultural product, and they\u2019re going to start that very soon, of almost immediately,\u201d Trump says. Trump is now talking about China and his meeting with President Xi. \u201cWe had a great meeting. we\u2019ve known each other as long as I\u2019ve been president,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will be continuing to negotiate, and I promise that for at least the time being we\u2019re not going to be lifting tariffs on China. We won\u2019t be adding an additional - you know, tremendous amount of - we have, I guess $350bn left which could be taxed or could be tariffed, and we\u2019re not doing that. We\u2019re going to work with China on where we left off to see if we can make a deal.\u201d Trump says the US has a very close relationship with Japan. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been closer to Japan than now. Over the past two days leaders from the largest economy have convened here in Osaka, which is a tremendous city,\u201d he says. Trump is saying the G20 meeting has been \u201cfantastic\u201d and Japan\u2019s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe has done a great job organising it. Trump has just taken the podium. He\u2019s talking about the possibility of meeting Kim Jong-un. He said he is going to be at the demilitarised zone so asked the North Korean leader if he could meet him there. \u201cWhile I\u2019m there I\u2019ll shake his hand. There\u2019s been no nuclear tests, no long-range ballistic missile tests, gave us back our hostages -- hostages which was great and a lot of good thing sare happening over there. I said we\u2019ll be there and we\u2019ll see. I can\u2019t tell you exactly but they did respond very favourably,\u201d Trump said. British PM, Theresa May, also met Mohammed Bin Salman at the G20, in likely her last international meeting in the top job. World leaders have be holding multiple meetings in Japan this morning, including with Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman. President Trump held a media conference during their meeting in which he said the crown prince was doing a \u201cspectacular job\u201d . Trump called him a friend.
