It was winter, and outside was what looked like an endless empty landscape. I could see footprints in the snow, seeming to emerge from underneath the train itself. Someone had evidently walked across the tracks and wandered off into the wilderness. I wondered who this person could be and where they could be going? There didn't seem to be anywhere to go to. It was an enigma, as were many things in this vast country, the second-largest in the world. The construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, completed in 1885, is largely the story of Canada's beginnings. In a country 40 times the size of Britain, the population was only 4.5million and the provinces were isolated, both politically and geographically. The railway changed all that and was the spur to the unification of Canada. By taking the train one can see how hazardous forging a rail track across Canada must have been. They built a railway stretching across a practically empty country; no wonder it was called \"an act of insane recklessness\". It cost a fortune and its construction encountered atrocious engineering problems. Before setting off on this journey, I spent a few days in Toronto; there's lots to see and do in this lively cosmopolitan city (pick up a free entertainment guide from news boxes and shops). A big drawcard is the shopping. Most stuff costs less than it does in the UK, and you can get down to some serious retail therapy in the \"underground city\" that lies beneath the skyscrapers. (Remember that price tags do not include taxes - add another 15%.) But the west was calling and the highlight of the trip, the beautifully restored Canadian, with its fleet of refurbished art deco rail cars from the 1950s, was waiting for me at Toronto's neoclassical Union Station. Soon I was installed in my roomette, in the \"Silver and Blue\" class. It was tiny but contained everything I needed: wash basin, toilet, comfy chair by the window and a pull-down bed. One of the great train journeys of the world lay ahead. An hour out of Toronto and we are in rural Ontario, riding alongside forests of silver birch so white they appeared to have been formed by the snow itself. And they seemed to go on forever. The landscape became more deeply forested and isolated - beautiful in its chilly whiteness. The dining car is where you meet your fellow travellers. Surrounded by fresh table linen, art deco wall lights, and friendly staff, we sat down to a choice of Fresh Pickerel from Icy Manitoba Waters or Loin of Ontario Lamb. There was something surreal about this, when all that separated us from a snow-covered empty land was a thin layer of steel. Next morning, I was up at dawn because I'd forgotten to put my clock back an hour. Although we were still in Ontario, the landscape had changed. Gone were the slender birch trees. Dense forests of pine stretched to the horizon, broken up by the occasional huge white blankets of snow-covered lakes. After breakfast we stopped in the middle of nowhere to wait for some moose to move off the tracks and let us proceed. They took their time before rather haughtily and slowly shifting to the side. Viewed from the glass-domed \"skyliner\" car the train stretched ahead - a long silver tube snaking smoothly around the bends. When a freight train was approaching, the Canadian shunted to a sidetrack to allow it to pass. (This can take up to 20 minutes as some of these freights are more than a mile long.) Then it passed and for a few moments you could feel the silence of this immense landscape. The cost of the train journey includes one stopover and mine was Jasper, in the heart of the Canadian Rockies. We arrived two and a half days after leaving Toronto and a short taxi ride took me to Jasper Park Lodge, the hub of a village of cedar chalets and heritage cabins. Soon I was settled into a comfortable log cabin overlooking a glistening white lake of ice. Jasper National Park is one of the best winter sports centres in Canada. But you don't have to be a skier to enjoy a holiday in the snow - lots of other activities are available, like snowshoeing, snowbiking and exploring the frozen floor and ice caves of Maligne Canyon. There are also wagon rides and sleigh rides and two skating rinks with hot chocolate, a bonfire, music and lights available at night. Mechanised activities, like dog sledding and snowmobiling, are not allowed in the park but are available in nearby Valemount. The guided tour of the icy floor of Maligne Canyon was fantastic. Frozen waterfalls hung like delicate veils over the cliffs; the river was bunched up into fantastic shapes that could become whatever you imagined them to be. Marilyn Monroe broke her toe here. She probably wasn't wearing the special boots provided. Snowshoeing is not what it used to be. Gone are the awkward, tennis racket-type snowshoes. The snazzy new models are smaller and lighter and you can walk normally in them, which means you can cover more distance and it's not nearly as tiring. Two of us snowshoed across Maligne Lake, said to be the most beautiful in the Rockies, and we had it entirely to ourselves. After four days in Jasper, I boarded the Canadian for the last leg of the journey to Vancouver and almost 17 hours later we disembarked in Lotus Land, as the locals sometimes refer to their city. Just a couple of miles from downtown you could be in the hippy-dippy '60s. But the gleaming skyscrapers of the West End remind you otherwise; the city is decidedly hip. In less than an hour you can be sitting in the lodge at the top of Grouse Mountain, 1,250m above sea level, gazing beyond the snowy slopes to the city skyline below. But I'd had my snow fix in Jasper and wanted to explore what else the city has to offer. The answer is plenty (see more on Vancouver here). Something relatively new that I enjoyed was Treetops Adventure, a series of linked walkways near the Capilano Suspension Bridge, high above the forest floor, which give a squirrel's eye view of an unspoilt West Coast rain forest. And beach walking is a popular Vancouver activity any time of the year. As I gazed across the water I thought of the flight I was to take back to the UK the following day. How I wished instead that the Canadian was waiting to whisk me across the country once more. Way to go The Canadian departs Toronto and Vancouver three times weekly. You can book through Canada's VIA Rail or through International Rail Limited: 0870 751 5000. Prices for the Toronto to Vancouver route including one stopover range from CAN$807 (\u00a3388) for a double berth to $1775 for a Silver and Blue class double bedroom. The cheapest way to go is with an economy-class seat, for $388 in off-peak times. There are discounts for over-60s. Cathy flew between the UK and Canada with Zoom Airlines: 0870 240 0055.
