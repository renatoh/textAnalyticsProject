Depp did just that on Sunday night at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles, home to the Oscars, where he took part in a conversation alongside his Black Mass director Scott Cooper for one of the American Film Institute festival\u2019s onstage discussions. Shortly after sitting down for the hour-long talk, Depp took out what appeared to be a hand-rolled cigarette, proceeded to light it, and then dragged on it (and several more) for much of the evening. Some audience members literally gasped, but Depp smiled. \u201cThe sprinkler things are way up there,\u201d he said, pointing to the curtains above his head. Depp was discussing his performance as Irish-American Boston crime lord Whitey Bulger in Cooper\u2019s gangster drama, but also revealed much more during the talk, moderated by Variety\u2019s Jenelle Riley. Below are the key highlights. Depp doesn\u2019t bother with screen direction in scripts. The actor said he only reads through an entire script once before taking on a project. But when it comes time to prepare for the role, Depp said he only pays attention to the dialogue on the page and ignores everything else. \u201cI black out all screen direction,\u201d he said, matter-of-factly. \u201cWhy should I know what\u2019s supposed to happen? I think it should be much more organic.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s why he\u2019s a genius,\u201d Cooper said, causing the crowd to go wild with applause. Depp rarely watches his own movies. \u201cI hate watching myself on screen,\u201d Depp said. \u201cI can\u2019t stand it.\u201d The actor did, however, admit that he made an exception for Black Mass. \u201cI held on to my chair very tightly,\u201d he said of the experience of sitting through it. Depp was confident he could play Bulger \u201cI felt pretty confident that I could pull it off under the right circumstances,\u201d Depp said of the challenge of embodying the convicted murderer. Those circumstances involved a physical transformation, including makeup and prosthetics. Depp said he deems it his responsibility to make his audiences forget it\u2019s him onscreen within the first \u201cthree, five, seven minutes\u201d of any given performance. \u201cThat\u2019s really important to me.\u201d Depp feels more pressure when playing a real person Unsurprisingly, Depp said that when playing a real-life figure like Bulger or Donnie Brasco, there\u2019s an added pressure that goes along with it. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different process,\u201d he said of playing those figures, compared with, for instance, Willy Wonka in Tim Burton\u2019s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very important to me, no matter who the person is, to play that person with the utmost degree of truth that I\u2019m able to bring,\u201d he said of playing real people. \u201cBut playing a character like Jack Sparrow or Willy Wonka, that requires nothing but a degree of responsibility to the intent of the story \u2013 responsibility to the film-maker to deliver the goods. More than anything it just comes down to imagination: what are the ingredients for this character?\u201d \u2018All my characters are gay\u2019 Depp recounted the well-documented story that he was almost fired from the set of the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie because his outlandish performance as Jack Sparrow initially had Disney executives worried. \u201cIt trickled back to me somehow that, \u2018Goddammit, Johnny Depp\u2019s ruining the film! What is that thing? Is it drunk, is it gay?\u201d Depp recalled a specific meeting with someone from \u201cthe upper echelon of the studio\u201d. \u201c\u2018What the fuck are you doing?\u2019\u201d he remembered the person asking. \u201cWhen they asked if it was gay, I said: \u2018Didn\u2019t you know all my characters are gay?\u2019\u201d Depp hates auditioning Lucky for Depp, actors of his clout don\u2019t audition for projects \u2013 the work comes to them. But Depp recalled that before he became one of the highest-grossing actors in Hollywood, he was \u201cabsolutely horrible at auditioning\u201d. \u201cI was a young idiot,\u201d he said, looking back. \u201cI recognized that this [auditioning] process really had far less to do with performance and far less to do with connecting. So in my mind I always thought, to put it in a very nice way, this is horseshit. It\u2019s an uncomfortable place to be where you feel you must be \u2018on\u2019.\u201d Depp uncomfortably recalled one especially \u201crank\u201d audition for the Coen brothers \u201cwhere I embarrassed myself to new heights\u201d. He failed to reveal which project Joel and Ethan Coen had him read for, but said the encounter occurred \u201cyears ago\u201d. \u201cI can only imagine the choices I must have made,\u201d he said of the audition, \u201cbut what I do recall very well was how loud the silence was after I finished whatever I had done.\u201d Depp initially did not want to be in 21 Jump Street Depp\u2019s major breakout role as Tom Hanson in 21 Jump Street almost didn\u2019t happen, according to the actor. The actor had starred in Nightmare on Elm Street, Platoon and Cry-Baby up to that point, but said he was \u201cbroke\u201d before auditioning for the popular show, prompting him to try out. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do a television series,\u201d he said. He said his audition for 21 Jump Street was \u201ca last-minute thing\u201d, and that he had \u201cone of the worst flus I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life\u201d at the time. \u201cI went there, signed some piece of paper, did the screen test \u2013 and the next day I was on a plane to Vancouver. I guess that was my best audition.\u201d His daughter thinks he\u2019s \u2018weird\u2019 Depp said his two children have yet to watch Black Mass, but that he\u2019s not afraid of them seeing it. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen far worse,\u201d he said, laughing. When his kids went to go see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which he has yet to watch, Depp said his daughter, Lily-Rose, looked at her father point-blank and said: \u201cYou\u2019re really weird.\u201d \u201cIt was at that moment that I thought I did all right,\u201d Depp said.

It is Scott Cooper, not Hooper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
