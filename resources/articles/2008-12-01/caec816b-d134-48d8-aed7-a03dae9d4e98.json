If the Coca Cola adverts are to be believed, that's the sound of a merry Christmas, straight from the lips of a leering man who chuckles in the middle of the night while luring children with a free drink. In Britain, however, the holiday season merits more of a droll snicker, because that's the way British humour works, sharp and bitter and knowingly askew. There'll be plenty to laugh along with over the next couple of weeks, with a Christmas special from Gavin and Stacey, a comeback from Rab C Nesbitt, the much-anticipated A Matter of Loaf and Death (and a repeat of Curse of the Were-Rabbit) with Wallace and Gromit and a festive edition of Lead Balloon. America may be peerless at the sharp-talking, totally confident insiders' comedy, from Sex and The City to The Sopranos to Seinfeld to The West Wing. But only Britain creates provincial comic works of sweet and subtle oddness, as celebrated in the novels of Barbara Pym and Stella Gibbons, the Vicar of Dibley and the cosy rural domestic life of Wallace and Gromit. This cosiness is deceptive, shading easily into the macabre and grotesque. The municipal settings, small shops, dingy libraries and placid pace conceal the terrible (and horribly realistic) perversions of The League of Gentlemen, Nighty Night and Titty Bang Bang \u2013 remember the skinny man who invites frightened middle-aged prostitutes to his flat and urinates on them, breakdancing as he does so? This is the heart of British humour: the weirdness behind the farce, the tears behind the laughter, the note of degraded loneliness which lasts longer than the punchline. One of the sweetest, oddest, most beautifully acted running jokes in The Fast Show wasn't a gag at all but an unnamed love between an uptight country squire and his groundsman, Ted. Poignant humour derives from finding love where one would expect to find ridicule or stereotype \u2013 Gavin and Stacey being a contemporary case in point. And it is deep love, not the comfy sofa-bound humour, that makes The Royle Family a work of genius. Conversely, the cold humour of satirical comedy emerges when there is no love, only anxiety and fractious bickering behind an appearance of perfection. Britain has long been good at commenting on the proclivities, pretensions and peculiarities of class, from Keeping Up Appearances to The Good Life to Jeeves and Wooster (Britain has also always been good at chuckling in the closet). There is another seam of British comedy which is not encoded with subtle political critique: it is as though the flights of fancy, unforced silliness and whimsy of the nursery have never been abandoned. Monty Python, The Green Wing, Smack The Pony and Beehive all wear their love of nonsense on their sleeve, producing quick-draw sketches of gigglingly self-aware ludicrousness. British comedy makes great sport of defying gender stereotypes. We have brazen, impossible-to-embarrass women characters created by Karen Taylor, Catherine Tate, Little Miss Jocelyn (the persona/show created by Jocelyn Jee Esien), 3 Non Blondes and Katy Brand, whose first series showed her dressing up as a nun and shocking a real-life teen drug dealer when she nonchalantly tried to score off him on the street. Opposite these women are crippled, bitter, unfulfilled men, the Steptoes and Mr Beans and Alan Partridges of this world, doomed to a life of perpetual minority. They appear in various guises from Only Fools and Horses to The Thick of It and populate Britain's many comedies of institutional incompetence, from Are You Being Served to Yes Minister to Fawlty Towers to The Office. Britain does a neat line in obsessive underdogs, like the anti-heroes of Black Books, Shameless and Peep Show. Oh \u2013 there's one thing I forgot. Absolutely Fabulous. For all the above analysis, I never worked out why it's so damn brilliant. Guess I'll use the holiday to watch all the episodes for the hundredth time, trying to figure it out. That's when I'm not following the new series of Lark Rise To Candleford. Honestly, it's the most nastily funny spoof of Cranford I ever saw. Isn't it?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
