Any tough measures taken in the early months of a parliament can be blamed on the mess inherited from the last lot. David Cameron's coalition is going to conform to this stereotype. The next six months will be marked by announcements of cuts in spending and increases in taxes, but the hope is that painful memories will fade as policy is loosened. Labour's defeat on 6 May shows what can happen when the political and economic cycles become misaligned. The recession came at the back end of the parliament, a period when a government badly needed a \"feelgood factor\". At the other end of the spectrum, Margaret Thatcher got the political timing right in her first term, when a deep slump in 1980-81 was followed by recovery in 1982 and 1983. Even though unemployment had tripled to three million and was still rising, the Conservatives won by a landslide in June 1983 (helped by the split in the Labour party and victory in the Falklands War). For Labour, the nightmare is that Cameron does something similar, laying the foundations for a second and even a third term with front-loaded deficit reduction. Those of a gloomy disposition might reflect that long periods of uninterrupted rule by one party are the norm in post-war Britain (1951-64, 1979-97 and 1997-2010). The only period of pendulum politics was between 1964 and 1979. But the left's post-defeat depression can be overdone. The ultras on the Conservative right are already fretting about Cameron's alleged sell-out, but the prime minister knows that there is no appetite for a government trumpeting the virtues of deregulation and unfettered market forces. Indeed, he is clearly intent on completing the detoxification of the Tory brand: using the coalition with the Liberal Democrats to move towards the centre. A party without an overall majority grappling with a deep and still unfolding economic crisis at a time when the intellectual mood has turned against it sounds more like Harold Wilson in 1974 than Thatcher in 1979. As it contemplates a period in opposition, Labour has the advantage of knowing that the events of the past three years have not only ended the 30-year hegemony of neo-liberal economics but have also made the case for greater state intervention in economic management. Labour need not panic: on the contrary, it should do what Thatcher did between 1975 and 1979 and take confidence from having the intellectual wind at its back. This process will be made easier by the sheer scale of the economic challenge facing the government. Let's be clear: there is an economic case for the deep fiscal retrenchment that George Osborne plans in next month's Budget and in the equally significant comprehensive spending review in the autumn, but the arguments are more finely balanced than the inarguable political case for early action. The case for getting on with deficit reduction now has two elements \u2013 the benefits of taking action and the potential risks of not taking action. On the positive side, tighter fiscal policy takes demand out of the economy through higher taxes and lower spending and thus leaves scope for the Bank of England to keep monetary policy loose. It should be possible for the Monetary Policy Committee to keep the bank rate, currently 0.5%, lower for longer than would otherwise be the case. Cheap money should, in theory, keep the pound weak on the foreign exchanges, accelerating the much-needed rebalancing of the economy towards manufacturing and exports. There were some tentative signs of this already happening in last week's manufacturing output figures, but industry has been severely battered by the recession and faces a long period of rehab. During the election campaign, Osborne concentrated less on the positive case for speedy deficit reduction than on the potential risks of delay. Mervyn King foreshadowed one of these last week by pointing to the turmoil caused in the eurozone by fears of a spreading sovereign debt crisis. The Bank governor noted that the comprehensive package put together by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund was impressive but left the underlying problems facing the global economy unresolved. \"The window of opportunity afforded by last weekend's decisive actions must be used to tackle excessive fiscal deficits and rebalance demand by restoring competitiveness where needed\". An even louder clarion call for action comes from the Bank for International Settlements, the conclave of the world's central banks. In a health check on the sovereign debt of countries in the developed West, it concluded: \"Since the start of the financial crisis, industrial country public debt levels have increased dramatically. And they are set to continue rising for the foreseeable future.\" The BIS adds: \"Our projections of public debt ratios lead us to conclude that the path pursued by fiscal authorities in a number of industrial countries is unsustainable. Drastic measures are necessary to check the rapid growth of current and future liabilities of governments and reduce their adverse consequences for long-term growth and monetary stability.\" And when the BIS says unsustainable it means unsustainable. Its projections for the UK, for example, show the stock of gross national debt as a proportion of gross domestic products rising ten fold in the next 30 years, from just over 50% now to 500%. Britain, according to the BIS projections, is sitting on a public debt time bomb. But the long-term health of the public finances requires growth as well as fiscal restraint, and that's why the economic case for immediate action is nuanced. Britain's private sector was battered by the recession: consumption was hit by rising unemployment and short-time working; manufacturing investment has dropped by a third and the collapse in world trade has hit exports. For the past two years, it has been public sector demand that has spared the UK an even deeper recession and an even bigger loss of jobs. The new government's macro-economic strategy, therefore, relies on a revived private sector taking up the slack as the public sector is squeezed. In particular, it relies on the boost to industry from a 30% depreciation in sterling feeding through into strong demand for exports. Export-led growth is certainly what the UK needs: whether it will happen is highly questionable. Consider the facts. More than half British visible exports go to the rest of Europe, the bulk of them to the euro area. Yet this is a part of the global economy that struggles to grow. Over a full economic cycle from 2001 to 2009 Italy did not expand at all; Germany managed less than 0.5% a year; France a little over 1%. Spain, Greece and Portugal have all announced austerity packages and, like Britain, are seeking export-led growth. But this will remain a pipedream all the while Germany is imposing deflation on the rest of Europe and while Angela Merkel seems intent on becoming the new Herbert Hoover. There is, therefore, a risk that as the government shrinks the public sector there is only an etiolated private sector to take its place. Some recognition of this was contained in the coalition policy agreement, which said some of the \u00a36bn of savings this year would be ploughed back into the economy. A double-dip recession would put enormous strain on the Lib-Con pact, which is why Osborne will talk tough over the next few months but delay the real pain until 2011."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
