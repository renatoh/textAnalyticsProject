Mark and Patricia McCloskey, both personal injury attorneys in their 60s, will be charged with felony unlawful use of a weapon and a misdemeanor charge of fourth-degree assault. \u201cIt is illegal to wave weapons in a threatening manner \u2013 that is unlawful in the city of St Louis,\u201d the circuit attorney Kim Gardner told the Associated Press on Monday, arguing that the couple\u2019s actions risked creating a violent situation during an otherwise non-violent protest. \u201cWe must protect the right to peacefully protest, and any attempt to chill it through intimidation will not be tolerated,\u201d Gardner said in a statement. While the prosecutor who announced the charges against the McCloskeys said she was \u201copen to recommending\u201d that the McCloskeys participate in a diversion program designed \u201cto reduce unnecessary involvement with the courts\u201d, the case is likely to fuel continued partisan debate over gun rights and racial violence. Supporters of the McCloskeys said they were legally defending their $1.15m home. An attorney for the couple, Joel Schwartz, in a statement called the decision to charge \u201cdisheartening as I unequivocally believe no crime was committed\u201d. St Louis, like many cities across the country, has seen demonstrations in the weeks since George Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis. The incident in question took place on 28 June, when several hundred people were marching to the home of the Democratic mayor, Lyda Krewson, a few blocks from the McCloskeys\u2019 home. The McCloskeys live on a private street called Portland Place. A police report said the couple heard a loud commotion and saw a large group of people break an iron gate marked with \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d and \u201cPrivate Street\u201d signs. A protest leader, the Rev Darryl Gray, said the gate was open and that protesters didn\u2019t damage it. Video on social media showed the armed couple standing outside their home in the Central West End neighborhood, shouting at protesters. People in the march moved the crowd forward, urging participants to ignore them. According to a statement, Mark McCloskey confronted protesters with a semi-automatic rifle, screamed at them and pointed the weapon at them. The statement said Patricia McCloskey then emerged with a semi-automatic handgun, yelling at protesters to \u201cgo\u201d and pointing the gun at them. Protesters feared \u201cbeing injured due to Patricia McCloskey\u2019s finger being on the trigger, coupled with her excited demeanor\u201d, the statement said. Photographs and the video of the incident immediately went viral, and the St Louis police department initially said that they were investigating the incident, but that it viewed the McCloskeys as the victims, not the perpetrators, of an incident of \u201ctrespassing\u201d and \u201cintimidation\u201d. The city\u2019s top prosecutor, who is black, made a different announcement, saying she was \u201calarmed\u201d to see an incident \u201cwhere peaceful protesters were met by guns and a violent assault\u201d, and that her office was also investigating. \u201cMake no mistake: we will not tolerate the use of force against those exercising their first amendment rights,\u201d Gardner wrote. Gardner, the first African American circuit attorney in St Louis\u2019s history, was elected in 2016 as one of the country\u2019s new wave of progressive prosecutors, who aimed to reduce mass incarceration and address the stark racial disparities within America\u2019s criminal justice system. Gardner has already spent years battling with the city\u2019s police union and Missouri\u2019s Republican political establishment. Since she announced her investigation into the McCloskeys, powerful white Republicans, including Donald Trump, Missouri\u2019s governor, and the Republican senator Josh Hawley, have rallied behind the wealthy white couple and made clear that they would oppose any attempt to charge them. Trump said in an interview that the idea that the McCloskeys might be prosecuted was \u201ca disgrace\u201d. The Republican governor, Mike Parson, said in a radio interview on Friday that he would probably pardon them if they were to be convicted of anything. Hawley asked the justice department to consider a civil rights investigation of Gardner, suggesting that her investigation of whether the couple violated any laws was an infringement of their constitutional rights and an \u201can unacceptable abuse of power and threat to the second amendment\u201d. Gardner said she has received death threats in the wake of the comments about her by Republican lawmakers, and compared the attacks against her to violent threats by the Ku Klux Klan in an interview with the Washington Post last week. \u201cThis is a modern-day night ride, and everybody knows it,\u201d Gardner told the Washington Post, referring to the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s tactics of intimidation towards Black Americans. \u201cAnd for a president to participate in it, in the larger context of racism and cronyism, is scary.\u201d Several Black leaders in St Louis have expressed support for Gardner, including the Democratic US representative William Lacy Clay, who has said protesters \u201cshould never be subject to the threat of deadly force, whether by individuals or by the police\u201d. In January, Gardner filed a federal lawsuit accusing the city, the police union and others of a coordinated and racist conspiracy aimed at forcing her out of office. The lawsuit also accused \u201centrenched interests\u201d of intentionally impeding her efforts to change racist practices.
