It was when he trotted up the stairs into the studio audience (always career death) and met a woman, Laura Cooper, holding a little box that contained some hairs from her pet chihuahua. Is this, the 46-year-old TV presenter was surely asking himself, really what I have to do to fulfil my destiny and topple Ant and Dec from their thrones as kings of Saturday Night prime-time telly? And is there nobody, I asked myself, on the BBC payroll \u2013 a security guard, ideally \u2013 who can stop this sort of thing? \"You're more barking than the dog,\" quipped Norton. (I say \"quipped\", but that sounds more jaunty than anything that could, at that moment, have come from his frozen face and blank, apparently horror-stricken, eyes.) Totally Saturday's weekly staples include a contestant in a hamster suit running round a wheel while Norton shouts at him, and a conceptually doomed sequence in which a family moves its belongings out of its house against the clock in order to win some prize. There are also harrowing one-off items such as Girls Aloud knock-offs The Saturdays answering general knowledge questions from a pre-pubescent fan (\"Capital of Spain?\" \"Er, is it Madrid?\" \"That's right!\"). It is, I feel safe to predict, not going to win a Bafta. No programme that allows a woman to talk about her obsession with her chihuahua's hairs \u2013 unless we truly are in hell's innermost circle \u2013 will pick up a prize from the TV awards ceremony Norton himself presented in 2007. The seventh and final episode of the first series goes out tomorrow night and, while the BBC won't confirm that Totally Saturday is totally over, the safe money says it is. Earlier this month, BBC1 controller Jay Hunt told journalists at her autumn season launch: \"Totally Saturday was not as good as it should be. It has been popular with C2DE viewers who we traditionally struggle to bring to the channel, so it was a risk worth taking, even if it didn't quite come off.\" I'm not actually sure what a C2DE viewer is \u2013 but any hint of popularity among this demographic is but a fig leaf concealing a naked ratings failure. During its run, Totally Saturday's viewing figures have collapsed from 4.3 million for the series launch to a lowly 2.1 million \u2013 more than 1.5 million below ITV1's early-evening rival, the video-clip show Animals Do the Funniest Things. Hunt was on stronger ground when she said that if the BBC is serious about getting new audiences, it must take risks. Totally Saturday, though, was a risk no one in their right minds should have taken, one which has degraded both the people who made it and who watch it. (Though if it's any consolation, having seen a leaked copy of the original pitch document for the show, it could have been even worse: \"Think Ant &amp; Dec's Jiggy Bank or Mousetrap,\" it read, \"then think about Japanese gameshows, mix that with a bit of Total Wipeout and sprinkle a large sum of the funniest thing you've ever seen on YouTube. Now take it round the country and you might just have found the signature OB game for Totally Saturday.\") Norton, who declined to be interviewed for this article, may be many things \u2013 overpaid (he's on a \u00a37.4m three-year deal at the BBC), overdrugged (in 2006 the BBC defended his widely criticised remarks about his use of cocaine and ecstasy), over here (why doesn't he aspire to be RTE's Mr Saturday Night rather than the BBC's?) \u2013 but he is an admired TV professional who has come horribly unstuck with Totally Saturday. \"Since he came to the BBC from Channel 4 on a huge contract in 2005, he's done some great things,\" says a TV producer who worked on Channel 4's So Graham Norton. \"But the terrible thing for him is that Totally Saturday was made in-house by somebody who seems to think the era of Mr Blobby is not yet over. \"Had the show been made by an independent production company it might have been better, but this reeks of a format made for a highly paid BBC presenter whose golden handcuffs mean that something has to be devised for him to do. He must have known it was rubbish, but what could he do? His hands are tied.\" True, but they're tied with very expensive golden handcuffs, so it's hard to feel very sorry for him. Besides, Totally Saturday is only the latest in a series of calamitous BBC shows fronted by Norton since he was lured from Channel 4, using formats that borrow heavily from more successful versions of \u2013 with all due respect \u2013 trash TV. It's as though the BBC isn't sure what to do with the man who cost them so much. His bosses have repeatedly fired him from their cannon at the wall of Saturday night TV and, more often than not, Norton seems to have landed with a splat and slid down that wall unedifyingly. As soon as his Strictly Dance Fever (a spin-off from Strictly Come Dancing with the dull twist that the contestants were nobodies rather than Z-list celebs) hit Saturday schedules in 2005, critics started pointing out the inverse ratio between the presenter's huge price tag and the quality of the programming with which he was associated. Last year's The One and Only, a knock off of ITV's Stars in their Eyes in which 10 singing hopefuls dressed up as their idols and competed for a three month stint in Vegas, was described by a Guardian previewer as: \"Pop eats itself and then shows off the contents of its stomach with a self-satisfied leer.\" With Totally Saturday, and in the context of mass scepticism about the value of BBC's most highly-paid presenters, that critical carping has become deafening. Is Graham Norton really worth all this money, critics ask, if his role is chiefly to be Auntie's leading supplier of spectacular plum duffs? There are two especially harrowing aspects to the whole debacle. The second most harrowing was Jonathan Ross's pity. Nobody, not even (I'd guess) Ross's mum, wants the disgraced presenter's pity \u2013 not now, and probably not ever. But that is what Norton got from Ross, who told his BBC Radio 2 show listeners: \"Poor Graham, I feel for him watching that show.\" Media pundits were quick to detect schadenfreude behind Ross's remark: Norton's BBC2 chat show is to be promoted to BBC1 from the autumn, which may well mean they will be competing for the same guests. Ross's \"poor Graham\" was as though the BBC's highest earner, with a contract for \u00a318m over three years, had asked his chauffeur to slow down on the M4 to see Norton, the second highest earner, crawling from the wreckage of his up-turned limo. Oh dear. Poor Graham (tee hee). And Ross went further. \"What have we got on TV over the weekend? We had Graham Norton's Totally Saturday. Well, that's not good enough. It makes even that series John Barrowman was in [the BBC1 teatime variety show Tonight's the Night, which ended in the spring] look like a work of genius \u2013 and I was watching that for all the wrong reasons.\" Whatever you think of Ross, and I'm sure you've got an opinion, you have to admire his chutzpah in rubbishing the work of two high-profile colleagues in the space of five lavishly-licence-payer-bankrolled seconds. But then what was the most harrowing thing about Totallygate? Chris Moyles's condescension, that's what. The foul-mouthed, six-figure-salaried debacle magnet (remember how he was censured by Ofcom earlier this year for condoning negative stereotypes of gay people? Recall the panning Channel 4's Moyles' Quiz Night received?) told his BBC Radio 1 listeners that Totally Saturday is \"appalling television\". That must have hurt Norton: criticism from the man arguably responsible for the direst Radio 1 breakfast show since the station's inception. \"Imagine Saturday Night Takeaway with no budget,\" frothed Moyles, \"if everybody had been away for a week and hadn't come up with any ideas and they'd got to the office three hours before the show went live on the air - it's like that.\" Nice work, Mr Moyles: diss the BBC, slag a leading colleague and praise their arch rivals by implication. Strikingly, you have to step away from the BBC and its toxic inter-presenter badmouthing to get a sensible perspective on Norton's career in the wake of Totallygate. When asked about what the debacle means for Norton's career, media commentator Maggie Brown replies: \"So what? Most new television shows of this genre fail, and fall on the wrong side of being daft but watchable. It is embarrassing for the in-house BBC entertainment production team that made it, but that's show business for you. Move on.\" Last weekend, in his guise as the Telegraph's agony aunt, Norton wrote some wise words that echo this advice. A correspondent (Guy U, West London) worried that a \"bordello\" had opened across the street. \"Having lived most of my life in Godalming, I'm not use to this sort of thing.\" So what should Guy do? Well, Norton wisely replied: \"Pull your curtains and get on with your life\". Totally Saturday is on BBC1 tomorrow at 6.15pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
