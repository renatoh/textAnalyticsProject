He joined the Guardian in 1969, following in the footsteps of Sir David Low and Bill Papas, and at just 23 was the newspaper's youngest ever cartoonist. Throughout the offices of the prime ministers Harold Wilson, Edward Heath, James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and John Major, his incisive daily pictorial commentaries gave readers a unique slant on world history. During the Falklands war, on the sinking of the Belgrano in May 1982, his striking reworking of a second world war Philip Zec cartoon, recaptioned to read: \"The price of sovereignty has increased \u2013 official\" caused controversy when Thatcher, then prime minister, cited it as evidence the British media did not support military action. Gibbard was raised in New Zealand and moved to London during the 1960s, working first at the Daily Telegraph before joining the Guardian. During a long and successful career his work featured in many of Britain's national newspapers as well as on Channel 4's A Week in Politics, on the BBC's Newsnight, and on the political comment show On the Record. He contributed to several international animated features, including Under Milk Wood and Ivor the Invisible, as well as TV adaptations of the Beatrix Potter stories and The Wind in the Willows. He died suddenly and unexpectedly on Sunday after a routine operation. He is survived by Susannah, his wife of 32 years. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2010. The original gave Susannah's name as Susan. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
