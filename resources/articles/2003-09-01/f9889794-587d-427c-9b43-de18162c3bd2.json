Westwood completed the journey from hero to zero to hero again by getting round St Andrews yesterday in 67, five-under par. He hit 62 at Kingsbarns on Saturday and had rounds of 70 and 68 on Thursday and Friday at Carnoustie and St Andrews respectively. It all added up to 21-under, 267, good enough to beat Ernie Els by one, Raphael Jacquelin, of France, by three and Darren Clarke and Maarten Lafeber by four. Westwood wins the thick end of \u00a3500,000, moves to fourth in the Volvo Order of Merit and may now qualify for next week's American Express event in Atlanta. Depending on who does what in the US Tour event, he could rise to inside the world top 50 and thus get a chance at another $5m event. \"Winning at St Andrews,\" said Westwood, \"is something everybody dreams of.\" Only three years ago, he was saying St Andrews was \"not even the best course in Fife\", but a genuine conversion seems to have taken place. As for winning when he had spent so long not only out of the winner's circle but not even playing at the weekend, he said: \"I can't explain it. Some people just feel comfortable leading tournaments, others don't.\" Westwood has now won 26 times since his first victory in 1996, and that includes his recent three-year dry spell. \"Only one player in the world has a better strike-rate than that,\" said Chandler, \"and he's Tiger Woods.\" Westwood faced a series of serious shots over the threatening closing holes at St Andrews. There is out-of-bounds on the right and the Englishman's stock shot is a fade. But he kept it under control and indeed went so far left at the 16th that he was in danger of dropping what would be only his second shot of the tournament. It took 39 of his steps to reach his ball after his first putt, and it was still eight feet from the hole. With Els ahead of him birdieing the last two holes - the 17th outrageously with a 40-foot putt from the 18th tee - Westwood had to hole the second putt, and did. Then he faced the hardest hole in golf, the 17th, and hit a drive so good that it drew a thumbs up from Pete Coleman, his caddie, who had gone forward to ball spot. Then Coleman \"drew the right club\" as Westwood put it, a five-iron that finished safely at the back of the green. He needed a par at the last for his biggest cheque and the 18th should not be, and was not, a problem. Clarke did not manage the 17th so well. He found the Road Hole bunker, had to come out sideways and the resulting bogey not only ruined any chance of him winning, it also damaged his hopes of winning the Order of Merit. He was \u00a3350,000 behind Els at the start of the week, a difference that has now swelled to \u00a3540,972. The Torrances, 50-year-old Sam and 15-year-old Daniel, won the pro-am section with a score of 37-under and dad, Ryder Cup captain in 2002 and near to tears afterwards, said: \"A year ago I had a lot of help from 12 guys and this week I've had more from a 15-year-old boy.\" Daniel played the last two rounds, at Kingsbarns and St Andrews, in 68 and 67 which his father called \"phenomenal\" and yesterday Daniel provided three genuine birdies, one more than his dad. He intends to turn professional when he is 16 and, even if Sam thinks that is too early, there is not much he can do about it, considering that is the age he lost his amateur status. Brian Davis, with a 62, claimed a new Old Course record, equalling the score previously achieved by Curtis Strange, but on a lay-out lengthened recently."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
