There are well over 1,000 species and, between the tropics of Capricorn and Cancer, they extend right round the world. B. rex is currently on display at Wisley and has a lot going for it. Each leaf is more than 1ft across and the texture is puckered, making it satisfying to handle. Dark on the outside, then light green, then dark again at the centre. One of the distinguishing features of begonias is that they are always lopsided - enlarged on one side, flattened on the other. And only B. evansiana has any pretensions to hardiness, but it is popular for summer bedding and thoroughly enjoys being outside from June to October. There are various methods of storage, depending on the type of rootstock. Those with tuberous roots can often be dried off and overwintered somewhere cool and frost-free, and completely dark. In spring, they can be started off again in damp peat, either under heated glass or, if it's late in the season, in a cold frame. Begonias like some shade in the summer, so they're a good under-storey for taller plants. If you are growing, say, B. rex indoors, never stand the pot in water - try it on wet pebbles. Aim at a minimum 10C. One of the most useful begonias is B. scharfii, with its pale pink flowers that are seldom out of bloom and dark green foliage that is purplish red on the underside. It's good on a windowsill in winter. But our favourite is the handsome B. luxurians, whose leaves are divided to the centre into 11 fingers. In its second year, a plant will be up to 6ft tall. B. metallica is an old favourite, with a metallic sheen over the whole upper surface of the leaf. In 'Little Brother Montgomery', the leaf, which is divided into long, sharp points, is dark at the centre and margins, while the band in between is a mosaic of dark and pale, the main veins being dark. You never get bored with a leaf like this. We recently acquired 'Bonfire', which is low-growing. The smallish, spiky flowers are dazzling scarlet. How we shall get on with it remains to be seen, but it certainly keeps the old arteries alive. With begonias, you are experimenting all the time. \u00b7 Readers can order three Begonia 'Bonfire' for \u00a36.95, or nine for \u00a316.85 (inc UK P&amp;P).
