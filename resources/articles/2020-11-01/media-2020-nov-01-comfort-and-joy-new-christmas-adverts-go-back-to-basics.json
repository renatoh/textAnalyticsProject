But coronavirus can\u2019t stop Christmas from coming as struggling retailers kick off high-stakes festive advertising campaigns in the face of brutal trading conditions. We\u2019re still at least a fortnight away from the milestone that is the big reveal of the John Lewis ad, but from 1 November television viewers will be transported to late December as the first crop of ads, filled with snowy streets, Christmas knits, mince pies and must-have gadgets, is broadcast. Retailers have been urging Britons to start present buying earlier than usual aware that any new Covid restrictions could play havoc with the traditional December dash and have a disastrous impact on sales. It is not yet clear what a new national lockdown in England would mean for retailers. Under the current tier system, even the highest level allows all shops to stay open, but non-essential retailers were forced to close for Wales\u2019s firebreak lockdown and they are shut in France. Online shopping is expected to move up a gear as shoppers navigate lockdown restrictions. This shift will benefit online specialists such as Amazon but disadvantage those with large store networks that usually see millions of shoppers at this time of year. Argos, the catalogue chain, is one of the first out of the traps with its ad featuring sisters putting on a magic show for their family with a \u00a312 box of tricks. Set to a new song by Take That\u2019s Gary Barlow, it celebrates the \u201cjoy of going back to basics\u201d, says Argos. In the coming days, other major retailers including Asda, Very and Marks &amp; Spencer will enter the fray, but the pandemic means big-budget extravaganzas will be thin on the ground. Travel restrictions scuppered cheaper shoots in overseas locations \u2013 last year Romania doubled for Sainsbury\u2019s Dickensian London \u2013 and companies keen to appear sensitive to the unfolding health crisis are organising myriad charity tie-ups. Vicki Maguire, chief creative officer at ad agency Havas, said retailers had to tread carefully to avoid looking like they were \u201cCovid-washing\u201d commercial messages. Maguire, who has worked on several M&amp;S campaigns, said the Christmas advertising season was the UK\u2019s \u201cSuper Bowl moment\u201d \u2013 a time of big-budget ads shrouded in secrecy \u2013 but this year it\u2019s all about tone with glitz. \u201cYou can\u2019t risk featuring multiple generations around a table passing a prawn ring around while the neighbours pop over,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the national mood is done with lockdown-style messaging reminding everyone how bad things are. People want more optimism, not tear-jerkers, but they don\u2019t want to be patronised if Christmas is effectively cancelled.\u201d In what is a familiar tradition in many British homes, the Argos ad begins with the sisters circling Marvin\u2019s Magic Set in the retailer\u2019s gift guide, which , unlike the main catalogue, is still being printed.Rob Quartermain, senior campaign manager for Argos, said planning its ad in a pandemic had been a minefield. It was filmed in September \u2013 a week after the \u201crule of six\u201d was introduced \u2013 at Shepperton Studios in west London, with the cast and crew \u201cbubbling\u201d in a nearby hotel. \u201cThe hardest element to judge this year was getting the tone right in terms of how people are going to feel about Christmas,\u201d said Quartermain. \u201cWe had to make delicate decisions around how extended family, in particular, was portrayed.\u201d In what is expected to be a common trope this year, Asda and Very are running \u201chomely, domestic, family-themed\u201d ads. The economic turmoil caused by the health crisis has resulted in advertising budgets being slashed by 10% in the run-up to Christmas, although companies will still shell out \u00a36.2bn in the festive advertising battle. Despite big cuts in cinema, newspaper and magazine advertising, spending on television the traditional launchpad of the big Christmas ad campaign,has held up at around \u00a31.35bn, demonstrating its continued importance to advertisers seeking big audiences. Stephen Woodford, chief executive of the Advertising Association, said that even in the age of streaming, TV advertising remained \u201ccritically important\u201d as it enabled retailers to \u201creach the most people\u201d at Christmas. In the run-up to 25 December, shoppers were making complex decisions about which supermarket, clothing or department store to visit, weighing up factors such as price, quality and convenience \u2013 with anxiety around pandemic shopping trips further complicating the picture. \u201cThese are big commercial battles to get you to shop in one store over another,\u201d said Woodford. \u201cWin that business millions of times and you\u2019ve got a great Christmas; lose it and you\u2019re struggling. Brands have to win the emotional battle and make people feel that \u2018that\u2019s the place that I want to go\u2019.\u201d \u2022This article was amended on 2 November 2020 to remove a reference to the DFS advert in the 11th paragraph, which was covered by an embargo"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
