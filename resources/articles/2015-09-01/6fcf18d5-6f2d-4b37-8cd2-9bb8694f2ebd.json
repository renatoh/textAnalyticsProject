News of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer\u2019s pregnancy, announced on her Tumblr blog, was greeted with hoots of derision and anger. Why, goes the argument, shouldn\u2019t a woman CEO take her full entitlement of maternity leave? And if she doesn\u2019t take it, what is she saying to a) the other women who work in her company and b) male CEOs who might want to take some time off to be with their families? What she\u2019s saying is: this is how I want to do things. You fight your own battles. I\u2019ve got twins on the way (plus a three-year-old already). I\u2019m going to work this out in a way that suits me. Newsflash: move over Gordon Gekko, women can be fat cat capitalist bastards too. This should not be shocking. What is shocking is how harshly a woman is judged for it. A woman in power is seen first and foremost as a \u201cwoman\u201d rather than as a \u201cleader\u201d, with all the assumptions that we make about that role. Leaders can often be difficult, obstreperous or psychopathic. Why shouldn\u2019t women be those things too? Mayer may not even go the full Gecko. We can\u2019t know. She may yet see the faces of her baby twins, give up work forever and open an orphanage. But for now she has put out a statement that attempts to reassure shareholders and busybody business types that having twins is not going to change her commitment to her company. And this is what has annoyed people. Fair enough, it\u2019s not sisterly. Or touchy-feely in any way. And it\u2019s not trailblazing for parents\u2019 rights in the workplace. But why should it be? Why do we have to agree with the personal decisions of every woman on the planet? Why does a woman CEO have to be a role model? Supposing you want to be curmudgeonly and irritating and eccentric and antisocial if those things are in your nature? You should be allowed to be. Because a man can be all these things and more and no one would even notice. I don\u2019t judge Mayer for her decision. And her childcare is none of our business. (What if she had a full-time, stay-at-home partner, for example? Is the decision still wrong?) But supposing you do judge her and think what she\u2019s doing is wrong, both as a parent and as an employer. So what? Let women be ambitious, tough, corporate, cruel, nasty and wrong sometimes. Because these traits are human. And men are allowed to be all of these things without any comment being passed. Until we let women make autonomous decisions about their lives, without expecting them to represent constantly, we will never have equality. There are thousands of different styles of leadership for men. There is only one for women: behave in such a way that others won\u2019t be offended by you. I don\u2019t defend or support Mayer\u2019s statement. Which is why she is CEO and I am not. But I defend and support her decision to do what she wants with her life, whether others agree with it or not. Feminism is not about women \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d as women . It\u2019s about equality. And that means having the equal right to be a person others might sometimes see as a total git. And I defend any person\u2019s right to be a git. Equal rights gittery. Enshrine it in law now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
