United striker Fraizer Campbell has moved in the opposite direction on a season-long loan. Although United have not confirmed how much they have paid for the 27-year-old, Tottenham revealed that they had agreed a fee of \u00a330.75m. As part of the deal, Spurs have agreed not to pursue a complaint against United for making an illegal approach to the player. \"This is a key signing,\" said the United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. \"Dimitar is one of the best and most exciting strikers in world football. His style and ability will give the team a different dimension and I am sure he will be a popular player with the fans.\" Berbatov was driven away from Old Trafford just before the announcement of his move was made public. In a statement the Bulgarian said: \"Joining Manchester United is a dream come true for me. I look forward to playing my part in helping this club win more honours in the years to come.\" Manchester City's new Arab owners had earlier demonstrated their huge financial muscle by making an astonishing bid to hijack United's move for the Bulgarian international striker. City informed Tottenham Hotspur that they were willing to pay \u00a334m for Berbatov, eclipsing United's initial \u00a325m offer. Hughes claimed Spurs had accepted City's bid and said he hoped to hold talks with Berbatov. \"I think it's agreed between ourselves and Tottenham, and now really it's down to the boy to make a decision I think,\" said Hughes. However, it later emerged that Berbatov had met with Ferguson and chief executive David Gill and undergone a medical with United, as the Red Devils attempted to secure a deal before the midnight cut-off point. Nevertheless, the bid demonstrated City's new financial power on the day that Thaksin Shinawatra sold the club to the Abu Dhabi United Group for Development and Investment (Adug), a company backed by the United Arab Emirates royal family and Dr Sulaiman Al-Fahim, a multi-billionaire who has been described as 'the Donald Trump of Abu Dhabi'. Al-Fahim also put in failed bids on Monday for Valencia's David Villa and Stuttgart's Mario Gomez. The \u00a3210m takeover has left City in the ownership of an organisation that has even greater resources than Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, and it has quickly become apparent that huge sums will be made available for Hughes to strengthen the team. \"It's really important we have a good season this year,\" said Hughes. \"There's been a lot of disruption and a lot of negative publicity surrounding the club but I think that's been wiped out in one fell swoop, and now we can move forward in a positive fashion. I am as stunned and excited by this as the fans are.\" Al-Fahim, the 16th richest Arab in the world, confirmed that the club would try to recruit the former Brazil international Ronaldo and explore the possibility of signing Thierry Henry from Barcelona in the next transfer window. Thaksin, who will remain at the club as honorary president without any administrative responsibilities, agreed the takeover on Sunday night after three weeks of negotiations with a company that has previously shown an interest in buying both Arsenal and Newcastle. \"We will release details later, but this is a great event for both the club and Abu Dhabi,\" said Al-Fahim, the chief executive of Hydra Properties. \"Our goal is very simple: to make Manchester City the biggest club in the Premier League, and to begin with to finish in the top four this season.\" City confirmed the deal in a statement this morning: \"Manchester City can confirm that a Memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the Abu Dhabi United Group (Adug) and Manchester City Football Club Limited,\" a club statement read. \"A period of due diligence for all parties, including the FA Premier League, has now been entered.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
