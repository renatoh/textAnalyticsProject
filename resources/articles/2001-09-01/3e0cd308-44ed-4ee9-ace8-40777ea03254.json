However, after the game Brown refused to be drawn on his future. \"I have no comment to make on this,\" he said after the game. \"It is a private matter between myself and executive committee of the Scottish Football Association.\" He praised the commitment of his side. \"The World Cup is over for us now. I don't fault the guys for effort but the best side won,\" he said. \"We were as attack-minded as we could possibly be with the players at our disposal.\" The mood beforehand was certainly optimistic among the 12,000 or so travelling fans, many of whom were wearing kilts or Loch Ness monster hats. Craig Brown must have been confident as his team arrived unbeaten in nine away matches, with victories in England and Germany during that time. If Scotland needed further incentive it came in the painful memories of the last-minute goal that allowed 10-man Belgium a draw at Hampden Park in March. But for that slip they would have started this game top of the group. Billy Dodds was promoted from the bench to start alongside Don Hutchison and although the Rangers' player was full of running, he saw little sight of goal in a tight opening. With Belgium also desperate for a win to ensure they do not have to visit Zagreb needing victory, there was a caginess about an opening period in which Scotland kept far better possession than against Croatia. Lambert, recovered from the blisters which troubled him at Hampden Park, was far neater on the ball, rarely wasting a pass initially and winning important tackles from his holding role in midfield. But although Scotland were controlling much of the game, the question was whether they could manufacture chances without real pace in attack. The early signs were not positive. Belgium seemed content to strike on the counter-attack. They stretched Scotland down the flanks via Bart Goor and Gert Verheyen, and pushed players forward from deep through the middle. They twice went close before taking the lead just before the half-hour. Marc Wilmots went close from 25 yards before Wesley Sonck beat Neil Sullivan to a high ball and headed over. It was Sonck who created Belgium's goal. His pass bisected Matt Elliott and David Weir, and the left-back Nico van Kerkhoven accelerated through to beat Sullivan comfortably with a low shot. That changed the complexion of the game. Belgium were in the ascendancy, dictating proceedings to such a degree that Scotland barely mounted an attack for the rest of the half. But for a tip-over by Sullivan, Verheyen would have added a second just before the interval. Defensively Scotland were looking far from solid, and with their set-pieces coming to nothing it was difficult to see where a goal might come from. Had Sonck connected with a knock-down and Verheyen not wasted a clear chance, it might have been over before the hour. Far from dominating with five in midfield, as Brown hoped, Scotland were largely on the back foot. Brown threw on Scott Booth in the 58th minute to create a three-man forward line, and that sparked sporadic pressure. But Elliott's header over from a corner in the 60th minute was Scotland's first real effort, and when Glen de Boeck got away with what Booth felt was a foul in the area, the Tartan Army must have thought it would not be their night. The dream is almost over. Mathematically Scotland can still reach the World Cup but realistically they face a summer closer to Troon than Tokyo. To earn a play-off Brown must hope Croatia lose at home to Belgium next month and that his side get enough goals at home to Latvia to overhaul the Croats on goal difference. Sadly, they barely looked like scoring here and when in stoppage time the Scots poured everyone forward for a freekick and were caught on the break for the second, killer goal, it was little more than Belgium deserved. Wilmots started the move and it was clinically finished by Goor, who slotted past Sullivan. Belgium (4-4-1-1): De Vlieger; Deflandre, De Boeck, Van Meir, Van Kerckhoven; Verheyen, Vanderhaeghe, Walem (Simons, 86), Goor; Wilmots, Sonck (B Peeters, 82). Scotland (3-5-2): Sullivan; Weir (Cameron, 74), Elliott, Dailly; Boyd (Booth, 58), Burley (McNamara, 82), Lambert, Matteo, Naysmith; Hutchison, Dodds.
