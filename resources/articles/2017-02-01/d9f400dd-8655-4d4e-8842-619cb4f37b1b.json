Their cowardly excuse was \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d but the truth is that reversing protections for trans people \u2013 students especially \u2013 have been at the top of the conservative agenda for quite some time. One of the many abhorrent things about this is the way the right invokes the protection of women as an excuse to discriminate against a marginalized community: they insist that women and girls will be in danger if trans women are allowed to be in the same bathroom. Nevermind that it\u2019s trans people who are at increased risk for violence in public spaces, bathrooms especially. So yeah, this week has been bad. Glass half full Protests broke out across the country in response to the rollback of trans kids\u2019 rights, but the one in front of the historic landmark Stonewall Inn is what really made my heart full. Thousands showed up to remind America that when trans youth are under attack, we \u201cstand up, fight back.\u201d What I\u2019m RTing Who I\u2019m reading Janet Mock on the truth of what these \u201cbathroom laws\u201d really mean; Carmen Maria Machado on being a woman who takes up space; and Susan J Fowler on her time at Uber, where she claims sexual harassment and discrimination was out of control. What I\u2019m writing A certain British self-identified professional provocateur had a no good, very bad week but let\u2019s not forget that our president is way worse than this now-exiled writer could ever be. How outraged I am Reading about the random ID checks that are happening on flights \u2013 domestic flights! \u2013 has me more depressed than furious, I\u2019m afraid. This is not what our country is about. How I\u2019m making it through this week Straight up fantasizing about living on another planet \u2013 which apparently isn\u2019t as unrealistic as it used to be!
