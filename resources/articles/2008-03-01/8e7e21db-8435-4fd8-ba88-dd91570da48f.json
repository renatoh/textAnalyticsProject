This letter to the editor, from the actress Fanny Mary Bernard-Beere, which appeared in the Guardian in July 1885, is a typical example: \"Sir - Perhaps it is hardly necessary for me to draw attention to an obvious printer's error in your kindly allusion to my forthcoming appearance at the Theatre Royal next Monday, wherein Mr Bernard-Beere's fine impersonation of [princess] Fedora is spoken of instead of Mrs Bernard-Beere, which I suppose was intended. Apologies for troubling you on so trivial a matter. I am &amp;c\". In the latter part of the 20th century advances in technology led to the disappearance of typesetters and proofreaders and with them went the \"printer's error\". Mistakes, however, are here to stay and these days it's subeditors who need to have broad shoulders because, as the Guardian's production editor told me last week, subeditors get the blame when they fail to spot the mistakes made by writers. It is only to be expected that in the race to publish more than a hundred thousand words in print and online every day - not to mention pictures, podcasts and videos - some errors will slip past a subeditor who may be working on several different stories against the clock. \"The subeditor's task is thankless,\" the production editor wrote in a blog recently. \"Like the goalkeeper in a football team, you can play a blinder, but make one mistake and that is what people will remember.\" My job involves, among other things, sifting through readers' emails about errors and deciding which should appear in the daily corrections column. Significant errors, as regular readers will be aware, take priority - we can't correct everything. I shouldn't have favourites, I know, but some mistakes have a certain charm. It's hard not to develop a fondness for homophones, for example, because of the absurd mental pictures they can deliver. I'm devoting the rest of this week's column to a few mistakes, of the lighter kind, which didn't make it into the daily corrections column. I particularly like the idea of the England rugby coach, Brian Ashton, needing to create \"effective and complimentary\" partnerships when choosing his team - as we said in an online article (Vainikolo a sweet distraction from safety-first picks, January 9). You can imagine the conversations in the scrum can't you? \"You're a marvellous hooker.\" \"Pshaw! But you, I must say, are the best flanker this team has had in years.\" In January the Education section published a 10-point plan for dealing with violence among teenagers (We need to talk about violence, January 22). Point number seven was \"Hold classes on resolving rows\" and under that heading we included a quote from an academic who said that young people need to be involved in creating peaceful solutions to their problems and conflicts. \"Here, here,\" were the (wrong) words we attributed to the chief executive of a charity in response to his comment. She was supposed to be voicing her agreement, not demanding his immediate presence. In an article on February 22, headlined How Texas votes, we overstated the powers of the former law lecturer and presidential hopeful Barack Obama when we attributed these words to a Texan politician who endorsed him: \"Obama is a once in a lifetime figure, a uniter of men who realises he has to reach across the isle.\" We don't think he was talking about the long arm of the law professor; we think he meant aisle, not isle. It wasn't an isolated example of the paper supersizing humans. A missing word in an online story about funding for the arts (Joy for some, misery for many: Arts Council rethinks cuts, February 1) left a strong visual impression on at least one reader. We said: \"The Bush theatre also expressed anger at the evidence upon which the Arts Council based their proposals. The tiny theatre, a breeding ground for new talent, said the Arts Council had got its figures wrong ... the theatre's most recent success was last year's Elling, starring John Simm, which transferred to the West End, attracting huge visitors.\" The reader asked, \"Would there have been room for them?\" reader@theguardian.com\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
