The decision to sack Moore and his assistants, Graeme Jones and Wayne Jacobs, came after their 1-1 draw against bottom club Ipswich, which meant they remain without a home victory in the Championship since Boxing Day, and have won just four of their last 12 games. They do remain fourth in the table, though \u2013 on track for a place in the play-offs. The chief executive, Mark Jenkins, told the club\u2019s website: \u201cThis has been an enormously difficult decision for a club which will always hold Darren in such high regard. He took over at a very difficult time last season and reunited the club, a contribution that will never be forgotten. \u201cBut we have made it clear from the outset that everything this season was geared to making as swift a return to the Premier League as possible. Unfortunately Darren has not been able to engineer the consistency of form and results to convince the board that this objective would be met. \u201cAfter discussions with our owners, the difficult decision to make a change was taken.\u201d Albion said the first-team coach James Shan would take charge on an interim basis, but the club \u201chope to be able to name a new head coach as soon as possible\u201d. Moore, who made over 100 appearances for the club between 2001 and 2006, had given no indication of his impending departure after the match. \u201cNobody is going to give us the right to win,\u201d he told the post-match press conference. \u201cWe have to go and earn it. We\u2019ll continue to work towards that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
