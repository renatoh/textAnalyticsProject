You can find out for yourself if you use Tapestry Holidays' new website. Last year the Turkey and Greece specialist introduced in-depth brochure descriptions of each room in all its coastal properties which included 'views of orange and lemon groves' to 'overlooks the road and other buildings'. This year it has gone one step further by posting pictures of each room on its website along with 360-degree images of the chosen hotel or apartment. Tapestry sales director Andrew Lee claims it is the first operator to offer the service. Last year's initiative of introducing detailed room descriptions has already cut down on customer complaints. 'We don't get letters from people who are disappointed with their hotel rooms because they know exactly what they are getting.' The upgraded website goes live tomorrow. \u00b7 Tapestry Holidays: 020 8235 7777"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
