It is already providing intelligence, both on alleged supporters of Osama bin Laden in Britain and what it can pick up about their activities elsewhere, including Afghanistan, in an unprecedented concentration of the resources of GCHQ, the government's electronic intelligence-gathering centre, MI6, the secret intelligence service, and MI5, the domestic security service. After drawing up contingency plans in the immediate aftermath of last Tuesday's attacks for widespread strikes, including use of ground troops, British officials now insist that any military operations will be intelligence-led. That is to say, as much information as possible will be gathered before any military action is taken. British defence sources made clear yesterday that a decision to take military action, and what kind, was up to the US. \"It is for the US to make up its own mind up on what type of action to take,\" said one. Britain is unlikely to participate in any initial cruise missile strikes against Afghanistan - which defence sources say could be ordered later this week - because its submarines equipped with the Tomahawk cruise missile are not near enough. However, British military help to the US could include the SAS, no stranger to Afghanistan or the mujahideen, whom SAS troops helped to train in the I980s in their campaign against Soviet forces. The combined use of cruise missiles and small mobile units of special forces would avoid the danger of sending in static forces vulnerable to guerrilla attacks. British military hardware and bases in the region include British Tornado and Jaguar aircraft based in Kuwait and Incirlik in Turkey, the RAF base at Akrotiri in south-west Cyprus, the US base on the British Indian Ocean territory of Diego Garcia, from where American B-52 bombers attacked Iraq during the Gulf war, and the US base at Fairford in the Cotswolds. A large British naval taskforce, led by the aircraft carrier, HMS Illustrious, and also including the cruise missile submarine, HMS Trafalgar, and the helicopter carrier, HMS Ocean, with a royal marine commando on board, is heading towards Oman, where it is planned that it will participate in a huge military exercise. These resources could be ordered to the Gulf or east towards Pakistan in the event of an escalation of the military campaign."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
