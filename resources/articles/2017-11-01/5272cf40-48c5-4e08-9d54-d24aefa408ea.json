It\u2019s the same with the outside, the inside. It helps if you can do different types of things, sometimes you might put spin on it. But I\u2019m not scared to shoot with my left foot, obviously.\u201d Obviously. The Belgian\u2019s left foot decided this match; his shot from outside the Leicester City area hitting the roof of Kasper Schmeichel\u2019s net at a speed that just did not seem feasible. It was the sort of goal that causes cheeks to puff out in astonishment and increasingly what people are hoping to see when they watch Manchester City play. Yes your team might get a chasing but there will be moments of virtuosity you won\u2019t forget. When De Bruyne was substituted in the 89th minute, he was applauded from all sides of the King Power Stadium. For a player who increasingly looks like a superstar, De Bruyne hardly acts like one. It\u2019s not like he is modest, but he is grounded, and so matter-of-fact as to be both endearing and just a little disappointing. There\u2019s no Ibra-esque talk of lions and immortality, just a clear-eyed focus on process and practice. That, of course, is the way Pep Guardiola likes it. \u201cIt\u2019s freedom but everybody has their position\u201a\u201d De Bruyne said of the gameplan. \u201cI know when Kyle [Walker] is going up and Raheem [Sterling] is going inside I have to take care of the winger for the counter. If I am more up then Kyle is going to stay and Raheem is going to be outside. It\u2019s fluidity in the team but knowing what you need to do at the right time. \u201cWe just have to try and see where the spaces are and then take advantage of it. Every game is going to give us something else and probably today was more on the left but I think Raheem came more inside as a result and the first goal he created was very good.\u201d Indeed it was. Sterling made the opener just before half-time with a piece of play that was David Silva-like. Playing a one-two with De Bruyne, the England man then dinked a ball between centre-half and full-back that completely turned the Leicester defence. Breaking beyond that back-line with a Sterling-esque dash was Silva. He cut the ball across goal for Gabriel Jesus, who simply couldn\u2019t miss. City have the same number of points after 12 games, 34, as Roberto Mancini\u2019s title-winning side of 2011-12. They have a better goal difference, by virtue of conceding fewer goals. But the talk is already of a new bar being set for the league in terms of style of play and questions are being asked as to whether City can now go the entire season unbeaten (for the record, Arsenal\u2019s Invincibles had 30 points at this stage). The fluidity and systematic understanding throughout Guardiola\u2019s team lends credibility to such talk. As does the fact that City have one of the most expensive squads in the history of the game. The City manager fumed at losing John Stones to a hamstring strain on the half hour. It was an injury he blamed on the defender playing 90 minutes in both of England\u2019s recent friendlies. Guardiola will now look to recruit a new defender in January but, for all of that, the substitute Eliaquim Mangala did a good job of standing in. The Frenchman, making only his second league appearance of the season, cost the club \u00a332m three seasons ago. Vincent Kompany also made his return to the side, though in his case after injury (sustained on international duty, which again drew Guardiola\u2019s ire). The Belgian was lucky not to be sent off in just the third minute when his tackle brought down Jamie Vardy. Claude Puel felt it was the game\u2019s crucial moment, Kompany felt Stones was providing adequate cover to prevent a goalscoring opportunity. \u201cIt was a good run from Vardy. I thought: \u2018I\u2019ll just use my joker now,\u2019\u201d Kompany said. The club captain may not be as vital to his team\u2019s prospects as he once was, but the experience he has accrued in winning two Premier League trophies should prove invaluable over the coming months. Asked whether this team are playing the best football he has seen in his nine years at the club, Kompany said: \u201cMaybe at this moment, but I want to remain on the cautious side, because we don\u2019t have any silverware to show for it. At the moment we haven\u2019t done anything special, we\u2019ve just put ourselves in a good position to go and do something great.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
