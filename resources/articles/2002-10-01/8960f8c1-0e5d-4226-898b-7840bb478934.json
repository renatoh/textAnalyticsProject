The book, a collection of aphorisms, memories and reflections on the past, is the first book in Quignard's trilogy of literary fragments, Dernier Royaume (Last Kingdom). Quignard reportedly said that he hadn't thought he would win because his book could not be easily defined. He told LCI television: \"It's a sequence of beginnings of novels, stories, landscapes, autobiographical fragments. It's not a novel or an essay.\" Quignard is perhaps best known for Tous les matins du monde (All the Mornings of the World), his book about an 18th century viola de gamba player which was made into a 1991 movie starring G\u00e9rard Depardieu. Other works include Le Salon de Wurtemberg (The Salon in Wurtemberg) and Terrasse \u00e0 Rome (Terrasse in Rome), which received the French Academy prize in 2000. The Wandering Shadows was pitted against Oliver Rolin's Tigre en papier (Paper Tiger) and G\u00e9rard de Cortanze's Assam. In the third round of voting, the Goncourt jury members gave Quignard six votes, while Rolin and de Cortanze got two each. De Cortanze's novel, a historical adventure about a young man who sets off for the Assam tea growing region of India, won another top literary prize on Monday, the Renaudot. The other book shortlisted for this year's Goncourt was Morgan Sport\u00e8s for The Insane."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
