He\u2019ll be out minimum of a significant amount of time. Potentially, his season can be over. He\u2019ll have surgery here in the near future. After we see how that goes, focus on getting better and healthy \u2013 that\u2019s all that really matters right now. Rodgers landed heavily on his throwing shoulder in the first-half of Sunday\u2019s defeat to the Minnesota Vikings. The Packers were expected to win the NFC North but they struggled when Rodgers broke his collarbone and missed time in 2013. He did not undergo surgery on that occasion, and missed seven games. \u201cThe focus right now is for him to have surgery and from that there will be more information,\u201d said McCarthy. \u201cOur focus is on his health, not really focused on the roster right now.\u201d On Sunday, Rodgers was replaced by back-up Brett Hundley, who had an unconvincing game and threw three interceptions. \u201c[The Rodgers injury is] devastating, no question about it,\u201d Packers receiver Randall Cobb said after the game. \u201cFirst and foremost, it\u2019s one of my closest friends, so to see him go down with that, it\u2019s tough. But we\u2019ve still got to play football. We\u2019ve got a long season ahead of us, and we\u2019ve got to figure out what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d Rodgers had thrown 13 touchdowns and three interceptions this season before his injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
