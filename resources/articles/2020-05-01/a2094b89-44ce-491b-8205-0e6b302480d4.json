Annemarie Plas, the originator of the initiative, said Thursday\u2019s nationwide applause for NHS and key workers should be the last one amid concerns the event has become politicised. Hydroxychloroquine drug mix \u2018a risk for cancer patients with Covid-19\u2019 Cancer patients with Covid-19 treated with a drug combination promoted by US President Donald Trump to counter coronavirus were three times more likely to die within 30 days than those who got either drug alone, a US study found. The preliminary results suggest doctors may want to refrain from prescribing the decades-old malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine with the antibiotic azithromycin for these patients until more study is done, researchers said. US deaths pass 101,000 Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the United States has recorded more than 101,000 deaths from Covid-19, moving past a sombre milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian said: \u201cWe know how important these services are to individuals and families but as we ease restrictions further, we must remember to keep one another safe. \u201cIt is crucial that worshippers remember to follow health advice. This is particularly important for people with co-morbidities aged over 50 and people aged over 70.\u201d Paris risk lowered to \u2018orange\u2019 Paris is no longer deemed to be a \u201cred\u201d coronavirus danger zone, the risks posed by the virus moving down a notch to \u201corange\u201d, France\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said. The orange rating means Paris is not as free of the virus as the majority of regions in France designated \u201cgreen\u201d. However, earlier lockdown measures will still be eased in Paris, with parks in the capital due to reopen next week.
