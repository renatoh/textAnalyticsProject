Thanks for joining us. Here\u2019s a summary of what has happened so far: St Louis police say the unidentified officer who had been called to the scene to investigate a reported theft shot three rounds. They say they currently believe one of those three bullets struck Antonio Martin and killed him. Martin\u2019s mother, Toni Martin-Green, has expressed her disbelief at what happened. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense for them to kill my son like this,\u201d she said. Local officials, including the African American mayor of Berkeley, Theodore Hoskins, have been quick to stress the differences between the majority black suburb and nearby Ferguson. Hoskins said more than half of Berkeley\u2019s police force is black, and said there was greater inter-racial understanding in the area. Questions remain over the lack of police video footage of the shooting. It has emerged that the police officer who shot Martin had access to a body cam, but was not wearing it at the time, and that the camera mounted on the dashboard of his vehicle was also not in operation, as it only turns on when the car\u2019s lights are on. Police are hoping to avoid a repeat of last night\u2019s protests. The demonstrations in the immediate aftermath of the shooting involved up to 300 people; fireworks-like explosive devices were detonated near gas pumps, apparently by members of the crowd. St Louis County Police have confirmed the identity of the teenager who was shot dead last night. As local reports rightly suggested, he is Antonio Martin, 18. St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at a news conference earlier today that they had delayed releasing Martin\u2019s name in order to ensure that his extended family could be notified first. The Democratic governor of Missouri, Jay Nixon, has just released a statement on the shooting of Antonio Martin. He certainly keeps his thoughts concise. This is the entire statement: \u201cThe events in Berkeley are a reminder that law enforcement officers have a difficult, and often dangerous, job in protecting themselves and law-abiding citizens.\u201d Correction: This blog previously stated that the officer was wearing a body cam at the time of the shooting, but that it was not activated. In fact, St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at a press conference that the officer had the camera inside his car, not on his person. At a press conference, the mayor of Berkeley, Missouri, has just been drawing a distinction between last night\u2019s police shooting and the events in Ferguson. The mayor, Theodore Hoskins, said that in contrast to Ferguson, the leadership of Berkeley, including that of the police, was largely African American as was most of the police rank and file. \u201cIn a city that is 85% black, we have a majority black police department, so our experience is different. Our police officers are more sensitive, and it is because of the black and white relationship you get a better understanding.\u201d Hoskins said of the 31 police officers in Berkeley, 17 or 18 were African American. The mayor said that he was not that concerned about reports that the police officer who shot Martin had not recorded the event on a body cam, given how new the technology was to the force and that officers have not been fully trained in its usage. He said it would have been \u201chelpful\u201d if there had been footage from a body cam, \u201cand in the future when we are properly trained there will be a severe penalty for any officer who does not turn it on\u201d. Hoskins urged the public and media not to \u201cjump to conclusions\u201d. \u201cAll protests are different,\u201d he said. \u201cLast night you would have thought it was Ferguson again. There is a jump to conclusion that all policemen are guilty. We all know that 95% of our police serve our community well, so jumping to conclusions is not acceptable.\u201d Antonio Martin\u2019s mother has spoken to a local reporter, saying, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense for them to kill my son like this\u201d. Speaking to the St Louis Post-Dispatch , Toni Martin-Green said Antonio, the oldest of her four children, was \u201clike any other kid who had dreams or hopes.\u201d The dead teenager\u2019s father, Jerome Green, told the paper that he had recently been trying get work through the Job Corps. \u201cIn the last year, he was really trying to find who he was. He was ready to take the world on. He knew he had parents who loved him. He had that support.\u201d The family expressed their disbelief that he would have wielded a gun at a police officer. \u201cWhy would he pull out a gun against the police? That\u2019s the thing I don\u2019t get. It just doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d his grandmother Margret Chandler said. The Guardian has uploaded video of Antonio Martin\u2019s mother arriving at the scene. Here\u2019s a summary of the main points from St Louis police chief Jon Belmar\u2019s press conference: A 34 year old white officer, who had six years experience, encountered two suspects at the Mobil gas station after responding to a report of a theft. He didn\u2019t know that one of the men was armed. The officer fired three shots after the victim raised a pistol at arm\u2019s length. Surveillance video from the Mobil station appears to support the police version of events. Only one of the shots hit the victim. No shots were fired by the victim\u2019s \u201cdefaced\u201d 9mm pistol. Belmar said the shooting was a tragedy for the victim\u2019s family and for the police officer involved. The officer will \u201ccarry the weight\u201d of this for the rest of his life, Belmar said. He said the incident underscores the pressures police officers face. Two witnesses have given statements to the police. The police are looking for the friend of the victim, who fled the scene. A crowd of up 300 protesters gathered at the Mobil gas station after the shooting and four arrests were made after police officers were assaulted. Several bricks were thrown at police officers and three \u201cexplosive devices\u201d thought to be fireworks bound together were set off. One police officer was hurt in the leg from one of the explosions another was injured by a brick. Belmar said it was \u201cdisturbing\u201d that protesters came armed with bricks and explosives. The protest has since \u201cdiminished\u201d. Belmar said it was \u201cunreasonable\u201d to expect the officer to have responded with mace or a taser when he was faced with a suspect raising a gun. \u201cThe officer responded with what he thought was commensurate force at the time,\u201d Belmar said. He added: \u201cBad choices were made ... this individual could have complied with the officer. It didn\u2019t have to end with him approaching him with his arm extended and an 9mm pistol in his hand.\u201d The police officer had a body cam, but was not wearing it at the time of the shooting. His police vehicle was also fitted with a video camera but it is only activated when the car\u2019s red lights are flashing, and they were not at the time. Belmar said officers were \u201cnot used to\u201d the new technology. The surveillance footage from the gas station was described as \u201creally pretty good\u201d. The victim had a record of three armed assaults and other charges for theft since he turned 17. His body was removed at around 1.30am. The unnamed police officer involved has been placed on administrative leave while the fatal shooting is investigated. Here\u2019s the second half of Belmar\u2019s press conference (apologies for a brief missing segment between recordings). Here\u2019s audio of the first half of St Louis police chief Jon Belmar\u2019s press conference. Crowds have diminished at the scene, Belmar said. He said four arrests were made, all for assaults against police officers. Belmar confirms that the officer\u2019s body cam was not on during the shooting. The officer involved has been put on leave. He will be talking to investigators and psychologists, Belmar said. Belmar takes reporters through the surveillance video which it released earlier. Belmar concedes that he couldn\u2019t see a \u201cmuzzle flash\u201d from the victims weapon in the surveillance video, before he was shot dead. Belmar said it was \u201cdisturbing\u201d that protesters took rocks to the gas station to throw at police. The victim was \u201cknown to law enforcement\u201d with a record for assault and fire arms offences, Belmar said. The police vehicle used by the officer had a \u201cdash cam\u201d. It is unclear if it was on. The car is being examined. Belmar said the video at the gas station was \u201cpretty good\u201d. The police officer is a white male, with six years experience, Belmar said. He was responding to reports of a theft. Belmar said the officer did not have time to fire a Taser at the victim. He conceded: \u201cbad choices were made\u201d. Several objects were thrown at police and three explosives were fired, Belmar said. One police officer was injured in one explosion, he added. Another was injured by a brick. Belmar denied that police fired pepper spray. Belmar says police are searching for the victim\u2019s friend. He said he was a key witness. Belmar said the victim\u2019s body was taken away from the scene at 1.30am local time. St Louis police chief Jon Belmar starts the press conference by sending condolences to the family. He said the officer involved in the shooting had six years experience. He confirms that the victim raised a pistol, before being shot three times by the police officer. No shots were fired by the suspect, Belmar said. Surveillance video has been released by St Louis police appearing to show a man raising a gun before he was shot. The incident takes place in the top left of the picture. While we wait for the police press conference to begin. Here\u2019s a summary of what we know so far: A St Louis police officer shot and killed a black teenager within five miles of the spot where Michael Brown was killed by a white officer in Ferguson in August. The police said an 18-year-old man was killed when he began drawing a gun. A weapon was recovered from the scene. A second man fled the scene. The victim was named locally as Antonio Martin. His mother, Toni, said she did not think he was armed, and accused the police of \u201cmessing\u201d with her son and a friend. Within hours of the shooting up to 100 protesters gathered at the Mobil gas station where it took place. Police fire pepper spray and arrested several people after fights broke out. A police officer requested \u201ccrowd control\u201d assistance within minutes of the shooting, according to a police radio recording. Protesters were confronted by police in riot gear at the scene. Police are under pressure to release surveillance footage of the incident. A police press conference is due to take place and an investigation is under way. St Louis Police requested \u201ccrowd control\u201d officers within minutes of the shooting, according to a recording purporting to be from police radio after the incident. The officer gives the time of the request as 11.35pm, some 20 minutes after police said the shooting took place. He is heard to say: \u201cRequesting assistance 6800 North Hanley at the Mobil Gas station. I just had a shooting and am requesting assistance for crowd control\u201d. Reuters reminds us of the context of rising tensions between the police and the community in the US before last night\u2019s shooting. Berkeley neighbours the suburb of Ferguson, where police officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown on 9 August - a killing that fuelled criticism of the way police and the criminal justice system treat minority groups. Protests in Ferguson have taken place for months and spilled over into violence when a grand jury decided not to charge Wilson. Demonstrations in cities across the country gained in momentum when a New York grand jury decided not to charge police over the death of Eric Garner, a 43-year-old black man whom police tackled and put in a chokehold. Before the latest incident, about 200 people marched in New York on Tuesday, defying Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s call for protests to be suspended after two police officers were killed in their patrol car on Saturday in an apparent revenge attack. In Los Angeles, police said they would investigate whether any officers were involved in the singing of a song, at a party organized by a retired policeman, that poked fun at the Ferguson killing. The lyrics of the song, on a video posted on entertainment news website TMZ, said: \u201cMichael Brown learned a lesson about a messin\u2019 with a badass policeman.\u201d St Louis police could release surveillance footage of the incident when they give a press conference in just over an hours time, according to reporters at the scene. There is also some speculation that CCTV footage from a shop opposite the Mobil station will be released when Berkeley mayor Ted Hoskins gives a press conference later. The Mobil Gas station is only five miles away from the point where the unarmed teenager Michael Brown was shot dead by police in August. Toni Martin said she did not think her son was carrying a weapon when he was killed, according to NBC news. The police claimed that the victim was drawing a gun when he was shot dead. Later a gun was recovered from the scene. She also told reporters that she found out about the fatal shooting from Antonio\u2019s girlfriend. St Louis County police are due to hold a press conference at 7am local time (it is 5.17am now). So far the force has just issued a brief statement about the incident. The victim\u2019s mother Toni Martin said the police were \u201cmessing\u201d with her son Antonio and his friend before he was shot dead. Speaking to reporters she claimed he was shot when he got up to run from the police. She added: \u201cHe was a good young man ... trying to get his life back together. We was trying to get him back in school and stuff.\u201d A crowd of about 100 people gathered at the Mobil gas station at the height of the protests, but the scene is now calmer, according to reports and video. AP has this account: The protesters gathered early Wednesday milled around the gas pumps at the station, some taunting and yelling at police officers. Some had strands of yellow police-line tape draped around their neck, with others using it as a headband. Authorities from multiple agencies, some in riot gear, stood among the protesters. Brown\u2019s death led to weeks of protests and some looting in the St. Louis area, actions that were renewed last month when a grand jury chose not to indict the officer who shot him. Some minor damage has been reported in the area around the gas station. The incident is trending on Twitter #AntonioMartin after the victim was named locally. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch named the dead man as 18-year-old Antonio Martin, citing his mother. His identify has yet to be confirmed by police. Before fights broke out at the gas station, protesters questioned why the police were dressed in riot gear. \u201cWhy are you in riot gear, I don\u2019t see no riot here,\u201d they chanted according to this Vine: This map shows how close the latest shooting is to Ferguson where the black teenager Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer in August. The fatal shooting was caught on surveillance video, which may be released by police later today, according to reports. There are varying reports about the number of arrests made at the protests as video emerges of what appeared to be fireworks being set off at the gas station. Police fire pepper spray at protesters at the scene after objects were thrown at the police, according to several reports. Video has emerged of earlier scuffles and fights that broke out between police and protesters in the wake of the fatal shooting. Hundreds of protesters are reported to have gathered at the Mobil gas station in Berkeley, Missouri where the teenage victim was killed. The station is being protected by police dressed in riot gear. Welcome to our live coverage of the aftermath of another fatal shooting of a black teenager by the US police. Here\u2019s what we know so far: An 18-year-old black teenager has been fatally shot by police at a gas station in Berkeley, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. The incident took place near where unarmed teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white officer in August. St Louis County Police Department said a police officer shot and killed by a man who drew a handgun. A gun was recovered at the scene. An angry crowd has gathered at the scene - a Mobil petrol station. The victim has not been identified by the police, but was name locally as Antonio Martin.
