But Shay Given made four outstanding saves here, the last of which, in injury-time, must be among the best of his career. Instinct and talent combined when Given found a close-range effort from the substitute Milan Stojanoski speeding towards him as the game moved past the 90th minute. Given flung his legs at it to deny an equaliser that was not wholly deserved by an at times unconvincing Partizan Belgrade. The Belgrade captain Sasa Ilic followed it up with a header that missed and seconds later the whistle blew. A couple of minutes earlier Given had made two other flying saves from Ivica Iliev and the former Derby County defender Taribo West. But the action of the last 10 minutes left a distorted impression of the contest, as Newcastle won this with greater comfort than anticipated. Nolberto Solano's 39th- minute toe poke gave Newcastle the advantage they take to St James' Park in a fortnight and Sir Bobby Robson's players should ensure a second consecutive Newcastle appearance in the group stage of the Champions League. \"It was as we expected, not easy,\" said Robson afterwards. \"The difference between the two teams was minimal. Partizan missed a very good chance in the last minute so maybe we were a little lucky, though it was a very good save by our goalkeeper.\" Robson was understandably effusive about Woodgate and revealed that the former Leeds United centre-half's display was all the more admirable as he is not fully fit. But certainly Sven-Groan Eriksson, who made the journey here, will have felt it worthwhile and Woodgate can expect to be recalled to the England squad for next week's friendly with Croatia at Portman Road. \"Woodgate was outstanding until the last 10 minutes, when he became visibly tired and I nearly took him off,\" said Robson. \"He hasn't trained very much. But in the first half he was a lighthouse for us. It was a big performance.\" Indeed it was and another in the return will mean a \u00a310m progression into the group stage, a figure covering the \u00a39m Robson paid to Leeds for Woodgate in January. Nothing can be assumed in the second leg of course but, if Woodgate's certainty spreads to Andy O'Brien and the two full-backs, then Newcastle will have a sound platform on which a naturally attacking team can flourish. If this is genuinely a turning point at the back, Alan Shearer and Craig Bellamy can rest easier and concentrate on their principal duties. Both looked sharp last night, Bellamy especially, as he ran past a succession of Partizan defenders. He paid for that with a series of fouls and the Welshman could have lost control in the second half when two defenders were in his face. Bellamy had only one chance to score, a difficult 29th-minute header clearing the crossbar before the hostile, 32,000 capacity stadium was left in a strange silence when Solano supplied the touch that won the night. Laurent Robert, who was hungry from the off, delivered an inswinging cross aimed for Shearer. But West gave Shearer enough of a nudge for Shearer to go to ground. Shearer was already into his penalty appeal as the ball continued to the far post, where Solano nipped in to stab the ball beyond the goalkeeper Ivica Kralj. The Partizan manager Lothar Matthau introduced the local favourite Ljbinko Drulovic after the interval but it took this creative midfielder some 20 minutes to adjust to the pace of the game. When he did, however, and with Newcastle beginning to fade in the heat, Partizan picked up the tempo. Given made his first late stop from Iliev - rushing off his line - in the 80th minute. West then had Given soaring off the ground with a spectacular 20-yard shot but the Irishman's best was left until last. It will be a major surprise if he has to repeat the feats at St James'.
