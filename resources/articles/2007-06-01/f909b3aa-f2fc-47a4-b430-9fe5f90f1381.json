The media's hysteria, hypocrisy, cynicism and negativity are a greater threat to peace and happiness in Britain today than any terrorist or criminal activity. This \"enemy within\" spreads a miasma of alarm and gloom that, as Blair says, \"saps the country's confidence and self-belief\". Most stories are blown out of all proportion in order to shock and sell copy - review the stories a day or two later and they are shown to be laughable in their irrelevance and hollowness. JA Daniels Yarm, Cleveland You state that \"distinctions between comment and news had become so blurred that it was rare to find newspapers reporting precisely what a politician was saying\". But on pages 6 and 7 you run a few edited extracts from the speech together with a long comment piece from Will Woodward, reactions from a range of political commentators and a sketch from Simon Hoggart. Surely a case of making the prime minister's point for him? Nicholas Milton Harefield, Middlesex Your editorial and entirely media-sourced reactions to the prime minister's speech do you little credit. Most of what he said was spot-on, and should be taken seriously. The press don't like the message, so they attack the messenger. By doing so, you refuse to acknowledge the central issue. Freedom and accountability are not incompatible, as every other profession has come to recognise. As to whether the British press is \"magnificent\", that is for the rest of us to judge. Richard Barras London Your leader (Right sermon, wrong preacher, June 13) makes a serious error, saying the \"press must remain free\". Why? When powerful organisations like the City of London, local authorities, trade unions and the medical profession are regulated, why should the media remain unregulated. They have been given every chance to self-regulate, and failed. David Buckle Abingdon, Oxfordshire After 10 years in power, Tony Blair has the gall to complain that the media threatens politicians' capacity to make the right decisions for the country. Because Blair and his government lack the courage to stand up against Murdoch and the like, it is the media's fault? I think not. He also says that the newspaper and TV regulatory systems need to change. In that case, why has he done nothing about it? Blair thinks that relations between politicians and the media are damaged and in need of repair. Is this an admission of failure? Wasn't his government's spinning good enough? Sandra Wasserman Chadwell Heath, Essex From spin doctoring to rage, the Blair approach is to maintain control and limit debate in potentially difficult areas. Given that the Labour party had no contest to choose Blair's successor, and the fact that there is opposition support for the most dangerous of his measures, such as Trident, US foreign policy and the joys of the free market, a domesticated media would put us all in danger. To prevent the rolling back of civil liberties, war in Iran and the privatisation of public services, the media will need to get wilder still. Dr Derek Wall Green party principal speaker Impact over truth, lesson one: 45 minutes until our annihilation. But dress up your point as some bold insight into the changing nature of the media and all of that doesn't matter. Roll on the 27th. Colin Montgomery Edinburgh I misread your headline, Feral beast obsessed with impact. I thought it was referring to Blair. He has neutered the Commons, and neutered the BBC, so now it is natural that he wants to censor the rest of the media as it is the only opposition continuing to function.
