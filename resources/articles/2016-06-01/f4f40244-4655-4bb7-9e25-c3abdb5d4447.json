The 2016 global nutrition report says the world is not doing enough to tackle a worldwide epidemic that is leaving more and more people suffering from diet-related conditions such as stunting, anaemia, heart disease and diabetes. It finds that almost half the countries surveyed are experiencing very serious levels of both undernutrition and overweight or obese adults, while the number of children under five who are overweight is now approaching the number of those who suffer from wasting, or acute malnutrition. Not only is malnutrition responsible for nearly half of all deaths of children under five, it is also, along with poor diet, the leading driver of the global burden of disease. In socio-economic terms, 11% of African and Asian gross domestic product is lost each year through malnutrition, the report says. In US households where one person is obese, an extra 8% of income goes on healthcare costs; in China, a diabetes diagnosis leads to a 16% loss of income. \u201cFew challenges facing the global community today match the scale of malnutrition, a condition that directly affects one in three people,\u201d says the report. \u201cMalnutrition manifests itself in many different ways: as poor child growth and development; as individuals who are skin and bone or prone to infection; as those who are carrying too much weight or whose blood contains too much sugar, salt, fat, or cholesterol; or those who are deficient in important vitamins or minerals. \u201cMalnutrition and diet are by far the biggest risk factors for the global burden of disease: every country is facing a serious public health challenge from malnutrition.\u201d But even though preventing malnutrition delivers $16 (\u00a311) in returns on investment for every $1 spent, the study finds that nutrition-related non-communicable diseases received only $50m (\u00a335m) of donor funding in 2014 \u2013 even though such diseases now cause nearly half the deaths and disabilities in low- and middle-income countries. After looking at the budgets of 24 such countries, the authors found that, on average, only 2% of spending went on reducing undernutrition, while donor allocations to nutrition programmes are plateauing at $1bn. \u201cWe\u2019re far from done addressing undernutrition,\u201d said Professor Corinna Hawkes, co-chair of the report and director of the Centre for Food Policy at City University in London. \u201cBut governments and donors now also have to cope with the threat that nutrition-related non-communicable diseases and obesity pose to improving global health and development. One in 12 people globally have diabetes now, and nearly 2 billion people are obese or overweight. We must stem the tide.\u201d The report does, however, stress that progress is possible, pointing out that the number of stunted children under five is declining everywhere except parts of Africa and Oceania. In Ghana, stunting rates have nearly halved \u2013 from 36% to 19% \u2013 in just over a decade, while Peru and Malawi are closing in on targets on breastfeeding and reducing anaemia. It says much could be done to reduce stunting through improvements in agriculture, health, education, social protection, and water and sanitation. But if the world is to reach nutrition targets and fulfil the sustainable development goals, the study concludes, there needs to be greater political commitment, more investment, improved allocation of resources and more, and better, data. Lawrence Haddad, co-chair of the report and senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, said political engagement is key. \u201cWhere leaders in government, civil society, academia and business are committed \u2013 and willing to be held accountable \u2013 anything is possible,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite the challenges, malnutrition is not inevitable; ultimately it is a political choice: one which we need leaders across the world to make.\u201d At the moment, however, such progress appears far off. \u201cWe now live in a world where being malnourished is the new normal,\u201d added Haddad. \u201cIt is a world that we must all claim as totally unacceptable.\u201d Barbara Frost, chief executive of WaterAid, said the report had been right to recognise the fundamental role that clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene play in nutrition. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that millions of children, having survived the difficult early years, still face an uncertain and unhealthy future for the simple lack of clean water and a basic toilet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot eradicate extreme poverty if we don\u2019t work together, and that means reaching everyone everywhere with clean water and sanitation by 2030, to help save lives, end malnutrition and allow children to become educated and thrive as productive members of their communities.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
