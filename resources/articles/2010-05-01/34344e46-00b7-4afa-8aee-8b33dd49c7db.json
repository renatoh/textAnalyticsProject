The coalition published its detailed programme, and offered a stab at a Con-Lib mission statement \u2013 \"a Big Society matched by big citizens\" \u2013 which unwittingly underlined what a workaday document this was. Last week's deal saw movement by both parties \u2013 on Europe, voting reform and tax \u2013 that represented heroic compromises or shameless sellouts, according to taste. The flesh belatedly added to the bones of the yellow-blue arrangement merely confirmed its general shape \u2013 and also contained many plans that New Labour ministers would have happily signed off on. The connecting themes of modernity, social mobility and enabling governance were also themes of the outgoing administration, and its patchy record should warn Nick Clegg and David Cameron that use of such verbiage does not guarantee that anything will actually happen. The rhetorical continuity with what went before confirms that Britain's centre ground is crowded. That will dismay those who hanker after politicians who dream bigger dreams, but it also confirms how the coalition process has capped five years of Cameronian leadership by anchoring the Conservatives away from wilder Tory shores. We learned that the Human Rights Act will now be built on as opposed to demolished \u2013 a potent example of how a Liberal Democrat presence is helping progressive currents within the Conservatives to prevail over reactionary tides. News of an inquiry into torture allegations reaffirms that benign impression. The new politics will not always produce new policies, and the agreement contained off-the-shelf Whitehall proposals as well as manifesto offerings wrapped in decidedly Whitehall language such as the promised regulatory \"passenger champion\". Amid the wet words were one or two radical and divisive ideas. In this category is the (potentially good) proposal of breaking down national pay scales for teachers, and a (worrying) hint that the NHS will be subjected to commercial-style regulation. A state-sceptic coalition will go further than Labour on both counts. It will also abolish intrusive ID cards, although it might pause to consider yesterday's encouraging poverty statistics, a final reminder that Labour's state action has been a force for good as well as ill. Government is rarely a happy place for purists, and the first of the inevitable compromises and contradictions \u2013 which had so sapped Labour's intellectual energy by the end \u2013 were evident yesterday. Localism coexists with a plan to lean on town halls to freeze council tax. Cameronian notions of general wellbeing are now strained by moves to counter European initiatives to balance work and family life. The promise of a one-in, one-out approach to regulations will win immediate plaudits from business, but the CBI will soon notice that the coalition is far clearer about new strictures on alcohol, credit and food labelling than it is in identifying which strips of red tape it can cut. The most striking evasions were in respect of the looming retrenchment. Reaffirming last week's promises on pensions, and adding new ones such as that on free museums, the programme even pledged not to levy supplementary rates on businesses until firms have been asked whether they fancy paying. The cross-party conspiracy of silence that held throughout the election campaign is thereby extended for now. Slippery language about \"supporting\" free nursery places, as opposed to ensuring they are actually available, may provide cover for cuts. So too will many of the 27 policy reviews signalled in the deal. The last prime minister gained a reputation for indecision when every tough question met with a commission and a promise that \"Mr Brown will look into it\". The coalition will not welcome that comparison. But it is fast discovering that politics \u2013 old or new \u2013 remains the art of the possible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
