The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the UK\u2019s auditing and accountancy watchdog, plans to make food retailing a priority sector for audit inspections this year. The FRC will \u201cpay particular attention to the audit of revenue recognition and complex supplier arrangements\u201d at food, drink and consumer goods manufacturers, as well as retailers. The ramp-up in regulatory activity comes after Tesco admitted it had artificially inflated profits by more than \u00a3263m as a result of the misstatement of payments from suppliers. The matter is currently being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the grocery market watchdog \u2013 the Groceries Code Adjudicator \u2013 and the FRC. Paul George, the FRC\u2019s executive director of conduct, said: \u201cEvents at Tesco did raise awareness of this issue but [the new regulatory focus] wasn\u2019t only as a result of Tesco. \u201cWe have been seeing over a period of time the complexity in arrangements between suppliers and their customers increasing.\u201d He said there were accounting and audit risks involved when relationships between suppliers and their clients evolved over time and this was not reflected in their original contracts. \u201cMore transparency is a good thing,\u201d George said. A \u201csignificant proportion\u201d of the 140 audits the FRC plans to inspect this year will be retailers and their suppliers, alongside other priority sectors including insurance, business services and companies servicing mining and oil companies, according to the body\u2019s annual report, which is published on Friday. The retail inspections will be separate from the FRC\u2019s investigation into Tesco\u2019s former auditor PwC and individuals within the retailer, in relation to the preparation, approval and audit of accounts going back to February 2012. George said he could not indicate when that investigation would be concluded. PwC, which was ousted as Tesco\u2019s auditor this year, and individual chartered accountants working for the supermarket could potentially face unlimited fines, legal costs and exclusion from the profession if the accountancy watchdog finds evidence of misconduct. Tesco has said it is cooperating fully with all the investigations it is facing. On Thursday, that led to speculation that the supermarket could be one of the first companies in the UK to strike a new type of deal with the SFO which would enable it to avoid a criminal prosecution. Under new powers introduced last year, the SFO can offer a \u201cdeferred prosecution agreement\u201d (DPA), a deal requiring high court approval, which includes fines and other undertakings if that is considered to be in the public interest and a company cooperates. A DPA deal does not protect individuals who might face criminal charges with the help of evidence provided by the company. In a speech last week, Ben Morgan, the SFO\u2019s joint head of bribery and corruption, said the watchdog had handed out its first invitation letters for companies to enter into DPA negotiations. Tesco and the SFO declined to comment on whether Tesco was among the companies to have been sent a letter. However, lawyers said such a deal could appeal to Tesco because it could bring about a settlement within months rather than the three to five years that a full SFO investigation entails. \u201cA DPA deal could bring about a much swifter resolution for Tesco,\u201d said Robert Amaee, a partner at law firm Covington and the former head of anti-corruption at the SFO. \u201cIf Tesco is one of the companies in settlement discussions with the SFO, it will have provided the SFO with evidence against senior individuals implicated in any alleged wrongdoing,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, Tesco\u2019s historic accountancy problems were highlighted again on Thursday when a US law firm said it had signed up a number of British institutional investors to pursue compensation for losses relating to the supermarket\u2019s profits overstatement. Tesco Shareholder Claims, which is supported by US law firm Scott and Scott, said it had also hired barrister Philip Marshall QC, one of the lawyers who acted for Paddy McKillen in his fight over Claridge\u2019s hotel with the Barclay brothers. The group said that, following advice from Marshall, it was \u201calready clear that the case against Tesco is strong and will involve a substantial claim\u201d. In Tesco\u2019s annual report released last week, the company said any legal action resulting from the SFO investigation or from legal action by shareholders \u201ccould have a material and adverse impact on the group\u2019s financial condition\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
