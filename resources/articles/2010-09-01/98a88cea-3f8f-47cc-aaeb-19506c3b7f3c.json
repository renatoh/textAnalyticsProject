Sometimes in football it is better to take a downward step, to swallow a bit of pride if necessary, if it means being in an environment that feels right, and Petrov's body language, as a Bolton Wanderers player, is markedly different now from those difficult days at Manchester City when he had begun to feel unloved and unwanted. It has been two months since the Bulgarian signed for Bolton, having come to the end of his contract at City and having found out the hard way that they would not be offering him a new one (Roberto Mancini, Petrov says, simply stopped talking to him). It represents a downgrade in terms of the clubs' fanbase and ambitions but is not one that bothers him. Petrov has immediately established himself as a first-team pick, offering width and penetration on the left of Bolton's attack. The knee problem that troubled him at Eastlands has been resolved and, by his own admission, there is an inner desire to show that City made a mistake by not trusting him. \"Everyone knows that they want to make a big club with the money,\" he says. \"They have brought in so many players and spent so much but I don't think, in this world, that everything necessarily comes with money.\" Fit and confident, Petrov certainly threatens to be a difficult opponent for England's right-back, Glen Johnson, when Bulgaria play at Wembley tomorrow. It is, in theory, a good time to play England and the 31-year-old understands the theory that says Fabio Capello's side might be ripe for an upset, even if Bulgaria's talisman, Dimitar Berbatov, has stated he no longer wants to play for his national team. \"For us that is very hard because he is the top scorer in the team,\" Petrov, a close friend of the Manchester United striker, says. \"He rang me to say he was going to retire but I didn't ask him for an explanation because it's personal and I'm not family. Everyone wants Berba back in the team but I don't think it will happen now.\" Petrov has had his own issues. \"Hard and frustrating\" are the words he uses to describe his final year as City, nursing a bad knee and an even worse grudge about the way he was overlooked by Mark Hughes and, latterly, Mancini. Sour grapes, you can imagine City saying in response, but Petrov says there is more to it. \"I went to see Mancini in January to ask about my future because my contract was up in June. He said it wasn't the right time and 'let's talk in two weeks' but after that there was nothing. Nobody spoke to me about my future again. Nobody looked me in the eyes and said: 'Martin, thank you for your time, you are a very professional player.' \"It surprised me. I am not an 18-year-old, I am a 31-year-old who has played in different countries and for my national team, so I think that I have a reasonably good name and deserved to hear something.\" The low point came after surgery to repair the meniscus cartilage in his knee. \"After that I didn't play another game and just worked alone. That was a very difficult time for me. I am 31, old in football terms, and when you have an operation, your contract is finished and the league is over, it's not good. The first question other clubs asked me was always: 'Are you OK now?'\" Owen Coyle, transforming Bolton into a more attractive passing side, was among those who recognised the potential for a bargain. \"I can remember how Bolton used to play,\" Petrov says, gesturing a ball going over his head. \"But when they spoke to me they made it clear they wanted to try to play more football; that helped me to make up my mind.\" Since then there have been no regrets. \"Everybody knows we don't have big names from the Champions League but it's a close-knit club and Owen Coyle is like a father to the players, always talking to everyone, checking everything is OK.\" In return Petrov offers Bolton pace and penetration, an experienced international who will be making his 79th appearance for his country tomorrow. \"There's pressure for us, too, because we want to qualify [for Euro 2012] but there is more for England,\" he says. \"Everyone knows that England have big names and very good players but I don't think they have a team. I don't know why. If you take out each player and analyse them individually, they are very good players. They have a big manager, too, but they just don't do it. It is a difficult time for England now and maybe that will be good for us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
