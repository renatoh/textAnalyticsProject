During a visit to a military base, Johnson will pledge extra funding for \u201cgrowth deals\u201d, before heading to Wales in the following days for talks with the farming community and then Northern Ireland to discuss restoring power-sharing. However, his willingness to take the UK out of the EU in a no-deal Brexit has been challenged already in Scotland by Ruth Davidson as she warned she could not sign up to such a policy. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives is expected to meet Johnson in Edinburgh on Monday, after the prime minister begins his trip north with a visit on the west coast. In her regular column for the Scottish Mail on Sunday, Davidson wrote: \u201cWhen I was debating against the pro-Brexit side in 2016, I don\u2019t remember anybody saying we should crash out of the EU with no arrangements in place to help maintain the vital trade that flows uninterrupted between Britain and the European Union. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government should pursue a no-deal Brexit and, if it comes to it, I won\u2019t support it.\u201d Saying she had confirmed her position to Johnson when the pair spoke by telephone last week after his election as UK Conservative leader, Davidson added: \u201cAs leader of the party in Scotland, my position exists independently of government. I don\u2019t have to sign a no-deal pledge to continue to serve.\u201d The Scottish government also poured scorn on Johnson\u2019s announcement of \u00a3300m for growth deals, saying that with a no-deal Brexit on the table it was \u201cfiddling while Rome burns\u201d. A spokesperson for Derek MacKay, the Scottish finance secretary, said: \u201cInvestment in Scotland is always welcome but on top of delivering on this existing commitment the new prime minister must honour his new found belief in the Barnett formula by transferring a full share of the \u00a33.6bn announced for towns in England to the Scottish government, further funding for no-deal planning as well as the \u00a3160m of farming funding that has been withheld, a fair share of the funds given to the DUP to prop up the UK government and the outstanding \u00a3175m of police and fire VAT charges that have yet to be returned. \u201cIf Mr Johnson thinks he can win over Scotland with recycled and underfunded spending plans he has a lot to learn in his new role.\u201d The announcement of \u00a3300m in cash for development projects comes on top of an existing \u00a32.78bn committed for growth deals across the devolved nations. During his visit to Scotland, Johnson is expected to say: \u201cOur union is the most successful political and economic union in history. We are a global brand and together we are safer, stronger and more prosperous. \u201cSo as we prepare for our bright future after Brexit, it\u2019s vital we renew the ties that bind our United Kingdom. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be in Scotland today to make clear that I am a passionate believer in our great union, and I look forward to visiting Wales and Northern Ireland to ensure that every decision I make as prime minister promotes and strengthens our union.\u201d Johnson has made visiting Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland a priority amid warnings from some Tory colleagues that a no-deal Brexit could increase support for independence. He has infuriated Davidson by sacking her ally, David Mundell, as Scottish secretary, and replacing him with another Scottish Tory MP, Alister Jack, plus an English MP, Robin Walker, as a junior minister. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is reviewing the timetable for a possible second vote on Scottish independence and Johnson has been branded the \u201clast prime minister of the UK\u201d by the SNP. Both Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford, the Labour first minister of Wales, have told the prime minister it would be \u201cunconscionable\u201d for the UK to leave the EU without a deal. Johnson told the first meeting of his cabinet on Thursday that he would be taking the title of minister for the union alongside that of prime minister \u2013 a move described by a spokesman as a statement of his commitment to strengthening the union."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
