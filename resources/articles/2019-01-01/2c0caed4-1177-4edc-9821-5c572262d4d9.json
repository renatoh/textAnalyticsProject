The beach, of course, is a big part of that Eden-like continent, so it is no surprise that coastal locations with glistening sand and glowing skies became an important fixture of Australian cinema. More surprising is how thematically flexible the beach has proved, used by film-makers for a wide range of purposes \u2013 from celebrating physical prowess to evoking metaphors about life, love, freedom and the flesh-piercing dangers of giant renegade umbrellas. Here are 10 excellent examples of Australian beaches on film. The Coolangatta Gold (1984) The director Igor Auzins\u2019s 1984 sports drama has everything you would expect from its title: namely slow-motion shots of Speedo-clad iron men pounding the sand, slicing through water and running into the ocean clutching kayaks. A never-buffer Colin Friels leads the cast in a film both formulaic and messy, obsessed with squeezing in as many recreations as possible (including ballet, gym workouts, band gigs and even nude dancing). Here the beach is a backdrop for testing grit and determination. Puberty Blues (1981) and Storm Boy (1976) In the turbulent years of childhood and adolescence, a good old-fashioned beach can either intensify or calm the rocky experience of growing up. The narrator of the 80s classic Puberty Blues explains that \u201cif you weren\u2019t a surfer girl, you were a nobody\u201d, the director Bruce Beresford using the location to explore societal hierarchy. The director Henri Safran took a more tranquil approach in his 1976 adaptation of the children\u2019s book Storm Boy, tying beautiful coastal wilderness to the life and evolution of the titular character. Sunstruck (1972) Welsh school teacher Stanley (Harry Secombe) decides to migrate down under after stumbling upon a sign advertising teaching in Australia \u2013 which depicts a topless man wearing a mortarboard standing atop golden sand. In this under-seen and underrated film, Stanley then imagines himself conducting a class of bather-clad students singing Waltzing Matilda. When he gets off the plane, however, he finds himself in a Wake in Fright-esque situation, living in a tiny sweltering backwater town. Stanley finds fulfilment teaching enthusiastic kids after discovering that the picturesque beach exists only in his mind. Swinging Safari (2018) Don\u2019t you hate it when you\u2019re flopping around on the beach minding your own business and then, all of a sudden, a huge renegade umbrella tumbles literally straight into you, the stem of it piercing your flesh like a knife penetrating a juicy piece of fruit? Trust the comedy auteur Stephen Elliott to turn the beloved Australian beach into a place of outlandishness and grotesquery. In his 70s-set comedy, a 200-tonne blue whale washes up on the local shore, symbolising a lost and purposeless generation \u2013 or at least a lost and purposeless local community, which contains a range of eccentric characters including an agoraphobic alcoholic played by Kylie Minogue. Down Under (2016) The cut-through line in the director Abe Forsythe\u2019s racially charged, Cronulla riots-inspired comedy about gangs of drongos going to war over nothing is uttered by Evan (Chris Bunton): \u201cIt\u2019s a beach. It belongs to everyone.\u201d The beach is where the conflict between the film\u2019s intemperate meat-headed characters begins and violently concludes, relaying the message that even the most beautiful natural things in life can be ruined by human folly. Breath (2018) The visual style deployed by the director Simon Baker in his adaptation of Tim Winton\u2019s best-selling novel is a far cry from the conventional, radiantly lit way to shoot surfer movies. The film\u2019s colour grading has a melancholic quality, as if emulating seafoam or mist from the crest of a wave. The beach here is not a place of joy and passion, but the centrepiece location in a complex contemplation of the nature of grief and thrill-seeking. High Tide (1987) The best-known collaboration between the actor Judy Davis and the director Gillian Armstrong \u2013 two titans of Australian cinema \u2013 is 1979\u2019s My Brilliant Career. They reunited less than a decade later for the lesser known but also excellent High Tide, which follows a vagabond back-up singer (Davis) who reunites with her estranged daughter (a 15-year-old Claudia Karvan) while stranded in a coastal New South Wales town ironically named Eden. Blue-tinged colour grading communicates that all the characters are submerged in the dramas and details of their lives. The local beach lingers on the story\u2019s peripheries, the director returning to it for moments of dramatic and visual inflection. Age of Consent (1969) The frames of British director Michael Powell\u2019s 1969 classic (adapting Norman Lindsay\u2019s semi-autobiographical novel) is filled with beautiful things. Shot on Queensland\u2019s Dunk Island, capturing the plight of creatively depleted artist Bradley Morahan (James Mason), who recharges his batteries by absconding to a sun-kissed coastal paradise, the gorgeousness of this central location competes against the gorgeousness of the film\u2019s leading lady \u2013 a radiant Helen Mirren, appearing in one of her earliest roles. The beach is a kind of soul-rejuvenating tonic. Dark City (1998) On the subject of beaches that exist only in the mind: the protagonist (Rufus Sewell) of this mind-bending sci-fi from the director Alex Proyas is obsessed with Shell Beach, a coastal town everybody can vaguely remember but nobody knows how to get to. Folks are confused because, to cut a long story short, a bunch of aliens in trenchcoats are messing with their minds. The beach symbolises the natural world that humankind has lost."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
