Entering the studio a hushed, polite wisp of a thing, it's not long before her hair is piled up, her eyes painted and her tiny frame wrapped in designer finery \u2013 like Batman's Poison Ivy, only less sinister. She suggests lip colours to complement the fabrics, and giggles with the styling team. Who is Paloma Faith? \"I've been a life model, a ghost in a ghost train, a cabaret artist, an Agent Provocateur sales assistant and a magician's assistant,\" says the 24-year-old. She's also an actor: she played Andrea the Emo in the St Trinian's film, and is in Terry Gilliam's latest, The Imaginarium Of Dr Parnassus. And her song, I Just Wait, is the soundtrack to that alcohol awareness advert. The song demonstrates Faith's Winehouse-like vocals, but it would be unfair to draw further parallels. \"It's tragic that you can define a whole movement in music by gender alone. People are like, 'Oh, look, another quirky girl.'\" In a climate populated by original female musicians such as La Roux and Florence + The Machine, is she weary of having to work harder to grab attention? \"I'm not competitive. I tried to get signed, but everyone thought I was too risky. Now people are like, 'Oh, weird girls can sell records.' It's a blessing and a curse.\" A cinephile, Faith wears her references proudly. \"Cinema affects everything, from the way I get dressed to how I build my stages.\" And if her live shows are anything to go by \u2013 they feature everything from illusionists to fan dancing \u2013 the creation of a multisensory experience is clearly important. \"I want my shows to be eerie and mysterious,\" she says. Her \"act\", as she calls it, is spellbinding \u2022 Paloma's new single, New York, is released September 14. An album, Do You Want The Truth Or Something Beautiful, is out on September 28. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 September 2004. The original said that Paloma Faith was in a band called Back to the Future and that the album is out on September 21. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
