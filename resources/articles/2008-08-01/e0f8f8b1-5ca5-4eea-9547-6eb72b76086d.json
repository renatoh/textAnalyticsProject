He knows that most of that energy has been sparked by opposition to his idea of supersize prisons containing 2,500 places apiece, but he takes it as a backhanded compliment that he has kickstarted a vital debate over the impact of ever lengthening sentences on the prison population. Eight months after his much vilified proposals for the first series of larger, state of the art prisons to be built by 2012 caught the headlines, the Labour peer, former businessman and government \"Mr Fixit\", is ready to answer his critics. Penal reformers, prison governors and inspectors sharply criticised the titan plans, arguing that they go against evidence that shows smaller prisons work better. But the Carter report, which set the framework for the government's response to the long-term rise in the prison population in England and Wales, did not only back a rapid expansion and acceleration of the current prison-building programme. It also advocated a new permanent Sentencing Commission to introduce a \"structured sentencing framework\" that would take account of the available prison resources and curb the appetite of the courts for longer sentences. That raised the judges' hackles. They rejected linking sentences to prison capacity, flatly dismissing talk of a Minnesota-style sentencing \"grid\", which prescribes sentences, as a major incursion into their judicial independence. \"The American dream would result in a nightmare in England and Wales,\" circuit judges warned. As far as Carter is concerned, there is no evidence that longer sentences are an effective deterrent. Too often, he says, judges are like surgeons who never know if the patient lives or dies because they don't see them once the operation is over. They have too little knowledge of the effect of their sentences, he says. As Carter spoke to Society Guardian last week, the prison population in England and Wales was \"holding level\" at just under 84,000, with no spares cells and 90 inmates \"locked out\" in emergency police cells. And this in August, when most crown courts are closed and judges are more likely to be found in Tuscany than sending offenders to jail. Indecent and unsafe Carter is convinced that, together, titan prisons and a new settlement on sentencing are the way forward. The alternatives to a continuous and expensive building programme, his report concluded, were to allow prisons to become overcrowded to indecent and unsafe levels, or endless measures to release prisoners early - undermining the authority of the courts. Carter recalls a recent visit to north London's Pentonville prison. \"When Pentonville was built, it was always big. It holds over 1,200 people,\" he points out. \"What do people find objectionable about size? They say it is hard to manage a large-scale institution. The implied criticism is that standards will drop and we are incapable of running larger things. \"But the same argument would apply to running bigger shops, such as supermarkets, compared to corner shops. Faced with the challenges of inefficiences, we have to find a better way. By breaking these things into units you can provide an effective and humane regime for people.\" What of his critics' argument that titan jails will lead to prisoners being held further away from their homes and families? \"London is short of 11,000 places. So there are 11,000 people from London postcodes who are stuck in buses and driven up the M1 and A1, and down the M3,\" he says. Sited in the capital, a large-scale prison would bring some of them \"closer to home\", he argues. A recent trip to Hollesley Bay prison in Suffolk brought the issue home. \"I went there as would an offender's mother without a car. Let me tell you that is the toughest ... Getting to visit your child or husband stuck in the middle of nowhere takes hours and hours. If we value this continuity [of family links] then we have got to get over this prejudice about size, and say we have to find a way to do this.\" He points out that ways were found to run big schools decently, and believes that dedicated staff on the five 500-place units that will make up each jail will ensure they avoid institutionalisation. He insists they are not simply warehousing inmates. Those who believe that 500 places is the optimal size for a prison overlook the practical fact that it is highly unlikely that 20-plus sites will be found in London to build them, he says. Talks are already under way about where the first titans would be built; possible sites are the Thames corridor, east of London, and the north-west of England, possibly Warrington. But Carter stresses that if the central question of sentencing is not tackled, then even three titans will not be enough. Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, has questioned expanding a failing prison system at all. \"The question I would ask her is why she, and everybody else, has been so ineffectual in persuading the judiciary of their point of view,\" Carter responds. Political football He acknowledges that the relationship between the government, the judiciary and the public is perhaps the most difficult of all. He believes recent debates over knife crime and proposals for tougher bail laws have hardened the public mood around sentencing. \"One reason incarceration rates are lower in Europe is that [the issue] is not a political football,\" he says. \"The interesting question for the next couple of years is whether this [locking up people] will be depoliticised or not?\" The fact remains that judges have blocked the sentencing grid idea, and a report last month by Lord Justice Gage on a Sentencing Commission did little more than recommend that regional variations in sentencing were ironed out. Will Carter have to go back to the drawing board? \"It is a question of what the parties will agree. It is highly unlikely the government will mandate a grid if the judiciary do not wish to implement it. [But] you have got to have something,\" he responds. Clearer sentencing guidelines could achieve a great deal without necessarily linking sentences directly to prison resources, he says. For Carter, the important thing is to keep the debate going. He believes that the senior judiciary is focused on trying to resolve the conundrum of how to ensure some management of the use of custody while retaining judicial discretion in individual cases. And if there is no agreement? \"Then we have to face up to the fact that we have to build more prisons, and that is it.\" Curriculum Vitae Age 62. Status Married, two daughters.
