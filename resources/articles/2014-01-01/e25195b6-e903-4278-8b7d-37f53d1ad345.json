Puncheon, on loan from Southampton, was guilty of a dreadful penalty attempt during his side's defeat at Tottenham and on Monday defended himself staunchly on Twitter following criticism from his former manager Neil Warnock. The Football Association is investigating a series of tweets that Puncheon published this week regarding Warnock but he is set to line up for Palace on Saturday when the London club play Pulis's former side Stoke City. Asked if Puncheon would remain on penalty duty, Pulis said: \"I hope so. Jon Walters missed two or three penalties at my former club [Stoke] and I still encouraged him to take them. \"It's been an experience for him. It's like falling off your bike the first time round \u2013 the quicker you get on that bike the better it is. I had a good chat with him on Monday in my office for 10 minutes. \"The kid has had a bit of a kicking, you have to expect it, he's in the Premiership and it was a poor penalty. That's fine, we all get that, you just get up and get on with it. \"Everyone has their ups and downs and the important thing for Jason or anybody who feels that their world has caved in is to roll your sleeves up and get on with it.\" When asked if the player had been putting in extra hours improving his spot-kick technique, Pulis added: \"I haven't seen him. He's probably in the dark practising.\" Palace, currently bottom of the Premier League on goal difference, have struggled to strengthen their squad so far in the January window and had been expected to make Puncheon's move from Southampton permanent for \u00a31.2m. However Pulis, who refused to be drawn on the player's controversial tweets, revealed a deal is now unlikely as the clubs cannot agree a fee. He said: \"I'm not sure it's a deal that the football club can afford at the moment. I think what Southampton want and what we're prepared to pay is too far apart. I also think that Jason has reservations in some respects but hopefully if there was a possibility I'd be keen to do it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
