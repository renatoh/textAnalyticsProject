But it would be good to think that Stanley Gene, Huddersfield's chunky stand-off from Papua New Guinea, will at least get a mention at the discussions next month. Gene has always given good value in his seven years in Britain, which previously included stints with both Hull clubs, but in the last two years, under the coaching of Tony Smith, he has toughened up on defence and developed a varied and accurate kicking game to make himself pivotal to this Huddersfield team. For 40 minutes yesterday he ran Widnes ragged, powering through his opposite number Jules O'Neill for one try and playing a part in three more as the Giants took a 30-18 lead. However, Widnes handled him better after the break, scoring the only two tries of the half themselves to secure a point which keeps them level with Warrington in the sixth play-off position, although they have now slipped behind their Cheshire rivals on points difference. Still, as their coach Neil Kelly said afterwards, a point at Huddersfield is not to be sniffed at these days. It is more than Leeds, Wigan or St Helens could manage and ended a run of five consecutive home wins for the Giants. Widnes should have taken both points, with O'Neill fluffing two drop-goal attempts in the last 10 minutes after Steve McCurrie had sent Jason Demetriou over for the equalising try. Earlier, however, O'Neill had kicked impeccably, with a series of conversions from near the touchline with out which Widnes would not have finished level. Huddersfield's first-half performance was all the more impressive as it came despite the absence of Brandon Costin, their influential Australian who was denied the chance of history by scoring a try in a 10th consecutive Super League match by a shoulder injury. They were 12-0 up inside seven minutes after Stuart Spruce's failure to deal with a Gene kick gifted a try to Marcus St Hiliare, then the Giants' Welsh wing Hefin O'Hare caught Widnes napping with a quick tap on his 20-metre line and showed impressive pace to hold off the cover. Widnes replied with the first of two tries from their young wing Paul Devlin but the Giants stretched away to 22-6 with Gene scoring his own try and then laying one on for Julian Bailey. Widnes cut that deficit to four points with two tries in five minutes from Phil Cantillon. However, more good work from Gene laid on another score for Paul Reilly, with two more goals from Paul White, a debutant scrum-half, giving Huddersfield the lead their first-half display deserved. They were unable to go on with the job after the break, with Hughes sending Devlin over for his second before Demetriou's equaliser, to leave Smith an unhappy man. \"I am very disappointed by our second-half performance,\" he said. \"We had five turnovers on the first play, and you must enjoy defending if you do that.\" Huddersfield Giants: Reilly; O'Hare, Cooper, Bailey, St Hilaire; Gene, White; Fleary, Turner, Gannon, Morrison, Roarty, O'Doherty.
