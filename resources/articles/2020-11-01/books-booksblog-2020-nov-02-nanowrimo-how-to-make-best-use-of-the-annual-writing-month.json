NaNoWriMo, or National Novel Writing Month, comes of age this year with its 21st birthday, and the concept remains as simple as it was in 1999: over 30 days, write at least 50,000 words of your novel. Almost 368,000 novels have been completed by participants. There are no prizes or league tables, just the satisfaction of taking part \u2013 and the potential creation of something publishable. There remains some sniffiness over NaNoWriMo in some quarters, usually published novelists who like to point out that some people write all year round. Half the world wants to write, it seems, and that means they think they can. Yes, writing a novel is hard work. And for every author that gets published, hundreds \u2013 possibly thousands \u2013 fail. But does that mean that we shouldn\u2019t write novels just for sheer enjoyment? It\u2019s the same reasoning I used to apply to Parkrun, dragging my unfortunate frame around a 5km course every Saturday morning. I was not running with ambitions to compete in the Olympics or finish a marathon, but does that mean I shouldn\u2019t have done it? It got me in better shape. Each time I improved a little. And I actually liked it. This is how we should approach NaNoWriMo. Beyond the writing, it is a big, global, online support group where writers can cheer each other on via social media. At the end of it, there might be 50,000 words of fiction and a sense of achievement. And it might well lead to bigger things. Crime novelist Elizabeth Haynes has participated in NaNoWriMo every year since 2005. The words she wrote during NaNoWriMo one year formed the bulk of her first novel, Into the Darkest Corner, published in 2011. Every November for the last 15 years, she has used NaNoWriMo to kickstart books, and every year she is fed up with people snarking about it. \u201cEvery year without fail I see something, a tweet, a blog, an article in a national newspaper, the gist of which seems to be, \u2018Oh no, not November again. All those people thinking they can write. All of those manuscripts flooding agents\u2019 offices! Please just don\u2019t!\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a competition. The world needs more novels, more readers, more writers. You want to be heard? Ignore everyone else. Work hard.\u201d Haynes had no intention to publish her first NaNoWriMo effort: \u201cIt was purely for fun. Publishing had always felt like something that happened to others, not me. I had three goes at NaNoWriMo before I had something with a beginning, a middle and an end. That was the first time I had something I thought I could actually edit.\u201d Many writers have used the intense 30-day deadline to get them going with a new project. Erin Morgenstern, author of The Night Circus and The Starless Sea, hasn\u2019t participated for years, \u201cbut when I did, I always liked it for quickly getting words down for rough drafts without overthinking everything. It\u2019s what got me writing seriously in the first place, because I used to write a few pages and hate them so I\u2019d stop. Having peer pressure and a deadline worked wonders.\u201d What everyone can agree on is that bashing out 50k words is just the start of the journey, not the end. Most publishable novels are double that, and need to be edited within an inch of their lives. \u201cI do maintain that the word \u2018draft\u2019 should be somewhere in the name, but National Novel Draft Writing Month doesn\u2019t have the same ring to it,\u201d says Morgenstern. Five tips for taking part in NaNoWriMo 1) To hit the target, you\u2019ll need to write at least 1,667 words a day. Sometimes the writing will flow; other days it won\u2019t. If you write over on the good days, allow yourself a day or two off during the month to recharge. If you fall behind, catch up the next day rather than letting the word deficit pile up to the end of the month. 2) Never mind the quality, feel the width. Get the story down \u2013 you can polish your prose later. 3) Decide: are you a linear writer or a modular writer? If you\u2019re the first, keep writing the story as it happens until you either finish it or the month ends. If you\u2019re modular, write scenes from different points in the novel. They can be stitched together later. Both approaches are perfectly valid. 4) Let your characters drive the story. You can outline your novel, but leave some leeway for your characters to do unexpected things and go along with them for the ride. Plot and structure can be finessed in the edits. 5) Some days you will feel like deleting the whole thing and giving up. Don\u2019t. If you can push on through the bad days, welcome to the world of writing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
