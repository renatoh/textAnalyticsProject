Last year the old place was in a sorry state, with the din made by a JCB digger drowning out the clamour of celebrations while England skittled Pakistan on the first morning. The \u00a332m renovation and extension work that was at its midpoint last August and gave Edgbaston a dispiritingly imperfect aspect for something so familiar \u2013 like a friend with a beard but no moustache \u2013 has now been finished and the new pavilion welcomes its first international teams. However improved the facilities for the players, corporates and members, though, England will hope that the volume generated by the Eric Hollies stand has not been muffled by the vast new development. That particular stand, where it is best to cross your fingers and breathe in as far as humanly possible when men dressed as Barney Rubble attempting to carry eight pints in rapidly disintegrating cardboard beer holders push past you, is the most strident in England. Given that the stewarding on entry is rather draconian, it does make you wonder sometimes on the character of people they turn away. Sir Ian Botham says the stand is a bull ring, presumably meaning it is as intimidating as the Wanderers in Johannesburg rather than like a Birmingham shopping centre. Botham, of course, was the man who first provoked the crowd there to amplify themselves to such a thunderous pinnacle with his spell of five for one after tea on the Sunday of the fourth Test in 1981. Had his captain, Mike Brearley, not firmly instructed the reluctant all-rounder to take off his trainers and put his bowling boots on for the session, Edgbaston may never have been inspired to reverberate so uproariously. Three years before that, it had hosted the first Test between England and Pakistan and in the space of a single over, Chris Old was on a hat-trick twice, ultimately missing out but still taking four wickets in five balls. I remember it vividly but while there was genuine excitement, there was nothing like the noise that boomed out during Botham's marvels. That Test in 1978 was the one where Bob Willis hit the nightwatchman, Iqbal Qasim, in the mouth, having gone round the wicket to target him, and featured a partnership of 89 between Clive Radley, who went on to score a century, and the debutant David Gower, which was like watching a Shetland Pony in harness with an Arabian stallion. It was not without incident, therefore, but only after 1981 did the racket become a regular feature of Edgbaston Tests. In 1982 Derek Randall was cheered as he scored an uncharacteristically dull rearguard century as one-half of arguably England's strangest ever opening partnership alongside Chris Tavar\u00e9. The air was more subdued in 1993 when Tim May and Shane Warne bagged five wickets apiece in England's second innings to earn Australia a crushing victory by eight wickets but four years later, when Andrew Caddick, Darren Gough and Devon Malcolm bowled Australia out on the first morning of the series in 32 overs, the sound was almost deafening. Edgbaston proved the perfect venue for the fightback to begin during the Ashes campaign in 2005 and the events of those four days have been so magnificently chronicled elsewhere that there is no need of a rehash here. But one memory I will always treasure is of a scene while driving through Kings Heath to the match on the first morning. As each car stuck at lights simultaneously heard the news that Glen McGrath had stepped on a ball and was out of the game, the line of traffic gently started to bounce in the manner of Trotters Independent Traders' three-wheeler a few minutes after they had sold their Harrison marine chronometer for \u00a36.2m. As well as all the onfield drama, Edgbaston has also finished the England captaincies of Mike Denness, Nasser Hussain and Michael Vaughan, observed Robin Smith perform heroics on a pig of a pitch in 1995 and Paul Collingwood slam a six to bring up a comeback century in 2008 after Andrew Flintoff had bullied Jacques Kallis with a brutal burst in the same match. It has witnessed so many staging posts on England's slow climb to the top that it would be fitting if they managed to achieve the draw or victory there to secure top spot. If they do, the big noise will begin in Birmingham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
