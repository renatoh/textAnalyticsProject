Eight months on, it was rather different. The relief was etched on the face of Mark McCall face long after Juan Pablo Socino\u2019s last\u2011second conversion attempt had drifted fractionally wide. From 25-13 up with six minutes remaining, tries from Nick Tompkins and Chris Ashton having taken Sarries into the comfort zone, the near-invincibles of last season came perilously close to a draw that would have been their fifth failure to win in the league this season. As McCall, their director of rugby, was quick to underline, the closeness of the contest at the end was a measure of how far Newcastle have come this season. \u201cThey\u2019re the most improved team in the Premiership,\u201d the former Ireland centre said. \u201cThey\u2019re transformed. They\u2019re a much different proposition than they were last season.\u201d Nearly three years into Dean Richards\u2019 stint as director of rugby at Kingston Park, the formerly forlorn Falcons are starting to show the kind of vibrant look that Harlequins had about them when the former England No8 was in the midst of his long-term transformation job at The Stoop. True, they might not have gone so close on Saturday had Saracens chased a bonus point try with less abandon, but the Falcons of old would have lacked the sharpness to strike on the counterattack. As it was, the replacement wing Chris Harris scored two tries on his Premiership debut, adding to the early second-half try Sinoti Sinoti claimed from a similarly clinical break \u2013 courtesy of a superbly judged hack upfield from Tom Catterick, a former utility back who is looking like a fine fly-half in the making, and a deft side-foot on the hoof from the flying Sinoti. The three tries took Newcastle\u2019s tally for the season to 22 \u2013 three more than Quins, two more than Leicester and one more than the Falcons managed in the whole of the 2013-14 campaign. \u201cWe play a really honest brand of rugby,\u201d Richards said, before deflecting praise to Dave Walder, the former Newcastle and England fly-half who returned to the club as attack coach in the summer. \u201cThe attacking style and structure that Dave has brought in has been challenging \u2013 not for us, for other teams.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about a four or five-year plan here \u2013 and we\u2019re probably two years ahead of that in the way the players are playing. We just need to tweak what we\u2019ve got, play in the right areas, take the right options at the right time and we could be winning games that people probably didn\u2019t think that we could win.\u201d As it happens, after all but holding their own against Harlequins and Saracens, Richards and his men face another of those games on Friday night: an acid test at Northampton. Saracens are back on home ground against London Irish on Saturday, relieved to have claimed their first Premiership win on the road since September. \u201cIt would have been gutting to have drawn that game,\u201d a relieved McCall said.
