Five stables raided with clockwork precision on Tuesday morning, 408 negative tests for EPO back by Wednesday teatime. Jeremy Phipps, the ex-SAS man now in charge of the Club's security, had got his first major assignment out of the way - and he didn't even need to blow anything up. So that's that. EPO is not a problem in British racing. Official. Except, of course, that in a sport which thrives on rumours like no other, there will always be cynics who won't believe a word of it, even if they test every last horse in training. Charlie Mann, who was mainly responsible for setting this week's events into motion, certainly hasn't changed his mind. Mann claimed in December that horses were running on EPO in Britain every day. What he also admitted, though, and indeed, still concedes without a murmur, is that there is no evidence to back his claims up. It is simply his opinion. In terms of newspaper copy, \"Trainer alleges widespread doping\" is far sexier than \"Trainer alleges widespread doping, but agrees he could well be wrong\". As a result, his claims were promoted far too readily, and in that sense, a PR exercise to rebut them, if that is what Tuesday's operation was, was a perfectly reasonable step for the Jockey Club to take. Martin Pipe might not see it quite like that, but then, PR and Pipe are barely on nodding terms. The champion trainer has little time for anyone or anything which does not assist in his all-consuming campaign to saddle winners. He is also well aware that his immense success has put plenty of noses out of joint. Pipe was never in any doubt that the results of the drug tests taken from his string would be negative, but he was just as certain, too, that the Jockey Club's claim that the process was random was nonsense. If the Jockey Club was serious about knocking the EPO rumours on the head, they had to test Pipe's horses, and they must have known it. He has been a target for gossip-mongers ever since he arrived on the scene in the 1980s and started to post winning totals which the great names of the past could only have dreamed. His horses invariably made the running at a strong pace, but it was not so much what they did, as what they didn't do, that made people wonder. Because what they didn't do was stop. It didn't help that he was a bookie's son who had learned to train from books, rather than serving his time in one of jumping's grand academies. Back then, jumps racing was something of a genial club for country folk where everyone got their fair share of the decent prizes. More importantly, the fitness of the horses could be a somewhat relative concept. Pipe changed all that, introducing interval training to racing and sending out horses with a completely new level of fitness. It is a routine which many other leading trainers, including Paul Nicholls, have now adopted, but with hindsight, it is no surprise that Pipe simply cleaned up for the best part of a decade. Nor, of course, that his success set envious tongues wagging. Mann denies that professional jealousy has anything to do with his claims, or that he had Pipe in mind when he made them. \"I've never had a conversation with Martin Pipe,\" he said yesterday. \"It's not because I'm jealous of Martin Pipe or that I don't train as many winners as he does. It's been going on for 12 years.\" But has it? Not in three of the top yards in jump racing, for sure. And if any leading trainer was using an illegal substance on a regular basis to improve their horses, surely someone would by now have blown the whistle. It is very hard to keep a secret in a racing yard. Charlie Mann is entitled to his opinion, but what evidence there now is, that provided by eight per cent of the National Hunt horses in training on Tuesday morning, suggests that his opinion is wrong. The Jockey Club, meanwhile, has shown that it has the ability to plan carefully and spring surprises, when once its efforts might have owed more to Monty Python's Spanish Inquisition. The PR exercise is complete, the headlines this morning are all about negative test results, and the only real glitch was the claim by John Maxse, the Club's PR Director, that the stables concerned had been chosen either on a random basis, or as the result of information received. Did they really get a tip-off? Naturally, they refuse to say, but it seems unlikely. That aside, though, they deserve their moment of glory. And if any of Britain's trainers have been fiddling with their horses, they must now realise that this would be a good time to stop. \u00b7 Coral have removed Dubai Destination from their betting on the 2,000 Guineas after receiving reports that he was unlikely to make the race. He had been their 9-2 second favourite. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
