It was a place where magical vaginas could shut down pregnancies; where unwanted pregnancies were a gift from God; where well-qualified women could be found tucked away on office shelves \u2013 whole binders full of them. Tina Fey compared this dark, cobwebby realm to the 1960s, when she quipped, \"What is happening? Am I a secretary on Mad Men?\" It wasn't a bad calculation, but as Republicans broke out their archaic views, it began to feel a good few centuries too optimistic. It was in August that the Grand Old Party should have circulated a memo warning candidates to avoid the subjects of rape and abortion. This was the month Todd Akin, Missouri senate candidate, boggled everyone with his take on female fertility. Asked whether abortion should be allowed when a pregnancy results from rape, he answered, \"From what I understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume that maybe that didn't work or something. I think there should be some punishment. But the punishment ought to be of the rapist, and not attacking the child.\" No mention of the woman involved; she could apparently be punished horrifically, no problem. The fallout from Akin's comments should have warned fellow candidates. But in October Republican state representative Roger Rivard recounted his father's advice that women often lie about consensual sex, telling a reporter, repeatedly, \"Some girls, they rape so easy.\" Then it was Republican Joe Walsh, who said he was against abortion, without exception, including the life of the mother, on the basis he believes the procedure is never medically necessary. Next came Indiana senate candidate Richard Mourdock, asked whether he agreed with abortion being available in cases of rape and incest. \"I think, even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape,\" he said, \"that it is something that God intended to happen.\" Despite all this, at the end of the first presidential debate, in early October, Mitt Romney seemed to be swaying the female vote that helped Obama to power. But in the second, addressing a question about equal pay, he talked of his efforts to improve the representation of women as governor of Massachusetts. He had asked women's groups to find candidates for his cabinet, and \"they brought us whole binders full of women\". The story wasn't true \u2013 women's groups had been working on the project before his election \u2013 but that awkward phrase went viral. And, like his colleagues, he couldn't stop pronouncing on women's rights. The binders comment was compounded by his pledge that, in the economy he would build, employers \"are going to be so anxious to get good workers, they're going to be anxious to hire women\". Well, so long as they've exhausted all other avenues\u2026 Thankfully, women weren't anxious to hire any of these guys. All lost their races.
