The high court granted special leave for the minister to appeal a federal court ruling that found the former immigration minister Scott Morrison instructed his department to set up a process for handling a major data breach, which it determined was guaranteed to fail. In February 2014 Guardian Australia revealed that the names, date of birth, nationalities and other personal identifiers of almost 10,000 asylum seekers held in detention had been publicly disclosed by the immigration department on its website. The disclosure sparked fears the asylum seekers identities may have been revealed to their countries of origin, which could put them at risk of further persecution. The department had advised affected asylum seekers in a letter they had two weeks to raise their concerns about the breach and a limited process was initiated to quickly assess the impacts. The federal court ruling found the immigration department\u2019s response was \u201cunfair to a significant degree\u201d and had not provided procedural fairness to asylum seekers affected. Dutton sought special leave to appeal the matter to the high court. The case had broader ramifications for the government because it was also the first case to consider a series of new laws passed to fast track immigration claims. The minister\u2019s counsel told the special leave bench that among the issues with the federal court\u2019s decision was that the new bill that had passed parliament \u201chas a necessary intendment to exclude procedural fairness\u201d and that this should have been applied to the data breach case. In the course of the special leave hearing, the minister\u2019s lawyer also noted that there were 86 other matters relating to asylum seekers affected by the data breach currently before the federal circuit court and federal court. Naomi Sharp, the barrister representing the asylum seekers, said: \u201cWe say that there are insufficient prospects of success for the applicants in establishing that there was no obligation of procedural fairness.\u201d Justices Virginia Bell and Michelle Gordon granted the minister special leave to appeal the case. A hearing date will likely be set down later in the year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
