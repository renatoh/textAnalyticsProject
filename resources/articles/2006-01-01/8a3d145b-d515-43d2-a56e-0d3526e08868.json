It's the last of his symphonies, but instead of brash bombast and confidence, the piece is shot through with emotional and musical ambiguity. Bernard Haitink's performance with the London Symphony Orchestra revealed the bravery and radicalism of this uniquely enigmatic work. There are weird moments of musical humour in the first movement, in the quotations from Rossini's Barber of Seville Overture, that perforate the music. However, Haitink didn't play these moments for laughs; instead these musical interlopers grimaced with sardonic glee in Shostakovich's chuntering orchestration for brass and woodwind. This musical carnival turned to a darker emotional world in the slow movement. Haitink played this sequence of fragments as a musical cortege, a procession of cello solos and brass chords. It's music that's totally without the grandiose rhetoric of Shostakovich's other symphonies, atomising the orchestra into strange, small groups of instruments. But the finale was the emotional heart of the piece. This time, Wagner is the musical ghost in the machine: the gloomy tread of Siegfried's funeral music from the Ring opened the movement. Shostakovich garlands Wagner's harmonies with a tripping, pastoral melody, and of all the double meanings in Shostakovich's music, this is surely the most baffling and the most chilling, especially when played with the aching tenderness that Haitink coaxed from the LSO. He played the whole movement as a deadly serious game of musical life and death, in which the integrity of the piece was continually threatened by interruptions and discontinuities. The end of the symphony, a solo for the percussion section, sounded less like the playful \"toyshop at night\" that Shostakovich said of the piece and more like the sound of distant gunfire. There was another masterpiece of musical ambivalence in the first half, in Maria Joao Pires's performance of Mozart's D minor Piano Concerto. But her playing was wanting in subtlety or poetry, and Haitink and the orchestra failed to bring to life even the transition from minor key intensity to major key radiance in the final movement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
