I'll keep an ear on him as we wrap. Right now he's making a joke about how he doesn't like turning to the left. Today, in federal politics: The Labor leadership hovered resolutely in the background, even if the story lacked a concrete verb. There's a strange and strained atmosphere around the parliament tonight that may or may not point to the emergence of a verb over the coming days. The Labor caucus had its last scheduled meeting, and so did the Liberal and National parties. Julia Gillard was there, in caucus, Kevin Rudd was not. There was a state memorial service for Hazel Hawke - a lovely send off in Sydney, with tributes and music. The Prime Minister left parliament to attend. Question Time was a surly, roiling affair. There was much outrage and analysis on the sidelines over whether or not the Prime Minister should have graced the pages of The Australian Women's Weekly for a photo shoot which captured her knitting a kangaroo for a prince or princess. Metaphors abounded about spinning and dropped stitches and the rest. The parliament ground on with its law-making business. MPs continued to bid politics farewell. Bye bye Alby. Schultz is currently blasting the anti-male culture of the Child Support Agency. He's saying men have killed themselves because of this agency. It's a long standing view, the one getting a run in this farewell speech. Wind farms are also getting a bash. But for now, good night. Thanks to Mike Bowers, Mary and Madhvi. See you all again tomorrow. Secker says he's been asked very often what got him into politics. My usual response is insanity. (It's a quip. The real response is good parenting, good values.) Now he's broken up about his mother, who passed away very recently. Tony, I think you will make a great prime minister. The public hasn't seen the best of you yet. Patrick Secker, the member for Barker, makes this observation in the opening sweep of his farewell speech. We are choosing to scratch with the turkeys rather than soar with the eagles. This is a reflection on the creep of the nanny state. Leaders must aspire to excellence, Gash says, not coddle mediocrity. The strain of preselection can be worse than divorce, and believe me, I know. Gash reflects on the struggles of entering parliament. And on friendship. Gash mentions Janice Croscio and Jennie George - two Labor women, both good friends. I was there the night Kevin Rudd was knifed. For a moment I felt for him as a person. But then that's politics. But is it politics, she wonders? Gash reflects on a union protest at parliament that got out of hand under the Howard Government. The destruction of property. There are times that I am ashamed about the eorsion of our standards. Gash said shouting loudly doesn't make it right. NSW Liberal MP Joanna Gash is the latest MP to deliver her farewell address in this final sitting week. She's telling colleagues she took some critical advice from the former Prime Minister John Howard - ring home twice a day, because your real friends are your family. Readers with us yesterday will know we mentioned a visit by Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alister Campbell. Campbell sat down with Guardian Australia reporter Oliver Laughland in Sydney. Ollie opened thus: How would you advise Gillard? Chasing through issues we've covered today. The childcare union is very unhappy with Professor Judith Sloan for her outing on Q&amp;A last night. We covered this controversy in posts at 1.30pm and 1.35pm today. Professor Sloan suggested in a blog that toddlers were being instructed by some dim-witted graduate from a second rate university. Michael Crosby, National President of United Voice, in response. There is outrage across the sector today that educators can be treated with such a lack of respect by a prominent commentator. Professor Sloan is Contributing Economics Editor at The Australian newspaper. There is real anger across the sector that they can be treated with such disdain. Prof Sloan sits on the board of the Westfield Group and holds a range of important public positions, including with the University of Melbourne. Early childhood educators feel Professor Sloan\u2019s comments denigrate their profession, which is one of the hardest working and lowest paid in our community. We call on Frank Lowy to repudiate these comments and distance his organisation from these outrageous comments. Here of course is the picture from The Australian Women's Weekly that people have been arguing about all day on social media, and talkback, and elsewhere. Thanks to AWW and Grant Matthews. Sometimes you just need a laugh, even if it's serious. More of the Question Time recap. The senate meanwhile has passed the motion we pointed to earlier today from Greens senator Richard di Natale on vaccinations. See my post at 1.15pm today for particulars if you are interested in the precise wording of the motion. The only other episode of note from Question Time that I've been able to detect following inquiries came from Wayne Swan, in the big chair. I gather Swan suggested Tony Abbott had downed an aperitif or two and missed a critical vote in 2009. Swan: The leader of the Opposition slept right through the critical vote, he was drunk, and didn't come into the house - he slept right through that vote. Bandt's effort to suspend the standing orders to deal with the Yellow Pages workers didn't go do down so well, as Mike Bowers picture shows. Adam Bandt, Andrew Wilkie and Bob Katter say yes. Everyone else says no. I think the no's have it. Breaking news now from the airwaves of Bendigo. Forget Downton Abbey. Tony Abbott has outed himself as a Borgen fan. As a fellow tragic, I'm impressed. HOST: What\u2019s your favourite guilty pleasure? TONY ABBOTT: Well, probably Cadbury\u2019s Diary Milk chocolate. HOST: Oh yes, well that makes you an Australian through and through. Me too. Me too! Hey, are there any TV shows that you have got to watch? TONY ABBOTT: My wife has become a real addict of shows with subtitles and there is a Danish political series about their first female Prime Minister called Borgen. It\u2019s terrific. Oh dear, Tony Abbott doesn't look happy after being sat down by the Speaker, Anna Burke. Presumably Bandt's intervention started here, with a consultation with the Manager of Government Business, Anthony Albanese, prior to the suspension. Albanese is currently arguing that he has sympathy with the plight of Australian workers, but he says the amount of parliamentary time on private members is increasing substantially. There has to be a process. While Bandt speaks to that motion, I'm going to post a couple of responses from readers. I've asked the audience to summarise Question Time in a single tweet. Here are some inspirations. Greens deputy leader Adam Bandt has moved to suspend the standing orders in a debate that concerns protecting Yellow Pages workers. Bandt is attempting to bring on an urgent bill to protect Yellow Pages workers jobs from a plan by Sensis to offshore production of the telephone directory. Treasurer Wayne Swan has placed further questions on the notice paper. There's a flood of personal explanations. Gives me a moment to gather some facts. With a big swallow and with a tissue handy, let's unmute Question Time. Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury is up at the dispatch box currently. Tenor Bradley Daley is back to sing to close the memorial service for Hazel Hawke, accompanied by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. It's Danny Boy. I defy you all not to cry. Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling From glen to glen, and down the mountain side The summer's gone, and all the flow'rs are dying 'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide. But come ye back when summer's in the meadow Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow 'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so. And if you come, and all the flowers are dying If I am dead, as dead I well may be I pray you'll find the place where I am lying And kneel and say an \"Ave\" there for me. And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me And all my grave will warm and sweeter be And then you'll kneel and whisper that you love me And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me. Now David Dillon, Hawke's grandson. She stood graciously in a league of her own. She touched us all, and gave the greatest gift of all, herself. Dillon is reading a poem he composed for his grandmother. There's something so brutal about final goodbyes. Pieters Hawke says she's been speaking for, and about, her mother for twenty years, but it's very hard on this occasion. There's just loss. Hazel is not here anymore. Sue Pieters Hawke, Hazel's daughter and carer, who is very emotional. I don't know how to say goodbye to my mother. Mum had an instinctive uncontrived tendency to pull towards good. Hazel's love was unconditional, but not uncritical. If she thought you were being an ass, she'd tell you. Mum enriched us in so many ways. Love of family, of the garden, of music. She loved the Opera House, she loved the orchestra, and she loved so many of you. Still resolute on the Question Time mute, but we will go back there, at least in summary. Shadow Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has been brandishing a t-shirt. I gather there's been a number of questions on boats and on the national broadband network. More music. Waltz of the Flowers. Ralph Willis - a minister in the Hawke period - opens with a joke about bisons and basins. Then another. The surprise - when Bob was made father of the year. That gets a great laugh in the Opera House. Willis says Hazel let Bob have it, in his presence, about his shortcomings as a parent, after the award was bestowed. Despite that, she was enormously supportive of Bob, Willis says. She performed so well in the role she became a revered figure in her own right. A couple more shots while the choir sings. Bob Hawke's arrival. And Kevin Rudd. That shockingly loud laugh. Her capacity to cut through pomposity. She was systematic and strategic about her causes while prime ministerial spouse. When her marriage ended her friends mattered a great deal. But McCarthy says she grew into her new found independence, found a second career, a great social life - so when Alzheimers came, it was a cruel blow. The loss of autonomy. McCarthy: Hazel was a very special person with an extraordinary capacity for friendship. I was privileged to be her friend. Throsby continues. That smile. It lit up a room. She speaks of Hawke's warmth, which that audio-visual presentation made clear. Now Hawke's friend, Wendy McCarthy, is reflecting on her life. She pays tribute to her bravery - about her life with husband Bob and about the terrible illness that took her. She says Hazel created an incredible sense of intimacy with people. She took her marriage vows seriously and she cherished her family; and she was committed to social justice. She lived through the shifting landscape of being female in Australia. Feminism - and what it might mean for her - was intriguing. The role of prime minister's wife she took very seriously. She had an incredible capacity for friendship. Thunderous applause in the Opera House for the Mozart. Now there's an audio visual presentation, a sequence of photographs of Hawke. Question Time has begun in Canberra. I have Mozart on one screen and Wayne Swan, acting prime minister for this 2pm session, thundering about the national broadband network, on the other. With no offence to Swan, I think he's the one getting the mute button. I'm so lulled by the lovely music I've neglected to explain - the musical tribute for this service is designed to recreate a Mozart piano concerto that Mrs Hawke once performed in at the Opera House. The service for Hazel Hawke is underway now at the Sydney Opera House. Margaret Throsby begins her narration of an inspirational Australian life thus: Hazel Hawke was a great champion of many causes and many endeavours. Music was a great passion. We are about to hear some Mozart. Someone has uploaded that section of Q&amp;A to YouTube. If so inclined, you can watch it here. The House is currently considering childcare legislation. Kate Ellis, the minister responsible, uses the opportunity to launch a beat down on The Australian's columnist Judith Sloan. If you were lucky enough not to see Q&amp;A last night - perhaps go and make yourself a cup of tea for this post. If you did see it last night's firdge nuking episode, you may recall Sloan was rather offensive about childcare workers, and faced a question about her views from a member of the audience. Ellis is rather cranky with Sloan, a lady she derides as a conservative cheer squad member. Sloan's views were offensive, incorrect, outmoded. Ellis says this could have been dismissed as the dinosaur views of an irrelevant commentator except the views are shared, she contends, by those opposite. The Coalition is opposing this legislation. Greens senator Richard di Natale is unhappy with the Australian Vaccination Network. Personally, I'd rate this unhappiness as more than reasonable given it's irresponsible to try and convince parents not to vaccinate their kids, which appears to be the aim of this organisation. This afternoon in the Senate, di Natale intends to move the following motion: That the Senate \u2013 Notes the low vaccination rates in certain parts of Australia, and the threat this poses to the health of Australian children; Notes the irresponsible campaign run by the Australian Vaccination Network, which is spreading misinformation about the risks of vaccination and discouraging parents from vaccinating their children; Calls on the AVN to immediately disband and cease their harmful and unscientific scare campaign against vaccines. Independent Rob Oakeshott is less interested in reading tea leaves on the Labor leadership - and more interested in making an open statement to the Governor General in the event that anyone is thinking about switcheroos. As Lenore Taylor reports, Oakeshott used a late night speech to deliver an \u201copen statement\u201d to the governor general, Quentin Bryce, who would ultimately have to decide which leader, if any, was able to form a government, urging her not to assume the independents would automatically support a new Labor leader. Oakeshott joins the Greens, who have said a leadership change would raise the possibility of going straight to an election rather than supporting a different Labor leader as prime minister. Here's Lenore. As Labor is again consumed by leadership speculation, the added complication of a hung parliament has raised constitutional questions. In a late-night parliamentary speech on Monday, Oakeshott made an \u201copen statement\u201d to the governor general, Quentin Bryce. \u201cWe have still more rumours from those formally and informally stalking Julia Gillard as commissioned prime minister. I want to address this tonight in an open statement to the governor general,\u201d Oakeshott said. \u201cI invite the governor general to assume nothing. I do not automatically support any political party. I support policy for the nation. I make decisions in this parliament, on nothing other than the policies,\u201d he said, nominating road funding, Indigenous constitutional recognition, tax reform, education funding and asylum policies as examples of things he thought were important. Let's look forward, and take stock. My intention this afternoon is to cover Hazel Hawke's memorial service live. I'll also keep a watch on Question Time (to the extent that covering two events simultaneously is actually possible.) The day in federal politics, thus far, all things subject to change without notice: A small frenzy erupted over the Prime Minister's decision to be photographed knitting for The Australian Women's Weekly. Strategic genius or blunder - you decide. (Or perhaps decide to get on with your life and think about something else.) Tea leaves were further consulted on the vexed matter of the Labor leadership. The Labor caucus met for the final scheduled encounter of this 43rd parliament, minus Kevin Rudd, who had to zip. Julia Gillard delivered a fairly mild pre-election pep talk for her troops. The issue of asylum seekers featured in a question to the Foreign Minister Bob Carr; and in an unsuccessful effort by backbencher Laura Smyth to spell out what Labor's no-disadvantage policy actually meant. The Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor seemed to think this course of action was a poor idea. The Senate has begun its sitting for today. It is currently considering legislation relating to the Australia Council. The House will sit very shortly. It really is wonderfully tranquil today. I'm relieved. I've popped below the line for the first time since launching politics live - what a luxury, to have five minutes to talk to readers. Mike Bowers has captured the steady gait of today, with Independent MP Andrew Wilkie enjoying a stroll up the press gallery corridor. Jacqueline Maley, over at The Sydney Morning Herald. Knit on, Prime Minister, and let the anti-knitting brigade carp. More to the point, let them go cold this winter. Over on The Hoopla, Corinne Grant isn't so much tired of knit-gate. She's tired of us. Really, really tired. I\u2019m entirely ready to take a shovel, dig up the press gallery and turn it into a garden for ornamental cacti. Their lack of self awareness is staggering. Who, on one hand, lectures politicians for focusing on leadership instability, while at the same time, reporting on nothing else? Clearly I am not the only cranky pants in possession of a live publishing outlet today. Back to the Labor caucus. This morning's meeting also approved amendments to the government's 457 visa legislation - sight unseen. Trusting souls aren't they? That legislation is still the subject of discussion with the crossbenchers. The House sits today from 1pm. Today's Senate sitting is already underway. Spinning a yarn. Malcolm Farr over on news.com.au is relaxed about the Prime Minister and her needles - but less relaxed about John McTernan - Julia Gillard's communications adviser. Malcolm's view, expressed here, is McTernan should stick to his knitting. Here's Malcolm: Julia Gillard's spin meister John McTernan gets almost as much publicity as his boss, which is a breach of the first rule of political advisers. He has been pinged for raising the prospect of post-election work on talkback radio, and for helping shape Government criticism of the use of 457 visas while he is here on one himself. Today Mr McTernan is up there again, not on the cover of a best-selling magazine but highly visible in the background to its creation. It was Mr McTernan who about two months ago pushed the idea of Prime Minister as domestic goddess, posing with dog and knitting wool. It was at a meeting of senior Labor figures seeking a strategy to soften of Ms Gillard's image. There was disagreement over the plan, but Mr McTernan persisted. The AWW has confirmed he suggested the pose. It must be said that - within the style of the Australian Women's Weekly - the cover photo is a reasonable representation. Julia Gillard does knit and occasionally would have a pooch at her feet. If for some reason she appeared on the cover of Cars and Mechanics Ms Gillard would be depicted in overalls installed carbies. So to see her on the front of The Australian Women's Weekly seamlessly knitting wasn't a huge shock. The so-called outrage over the AWW edition has been pretty strained. But the harm to the Prime Minister from this episode comes in the form of the renewed focus on Mr McTernan's role, and the unpopularity he is generating within the Government. The best political and communications advisers to Prime Ministers are neither seen nor heard by the public, not if they want to be effective. Mr McTernan is beginning to compete with his employer for prominence, and he seems to be doing as good a job presenting a positive image of himself as he is of her. Labor senator Mark Bishop expands on that question Foreign Minister Carr faced, and his answer this morning. Mike Bowers bumped into the Prime Minister wandering back from this morning's caucus meeting. His report is she looked upbeat. The official caucus debrief is on now. Lenore Taylor has wandered down and is sending me updates. The Prime Minister told caucus the election was about investing in the future versus 'cuts to the bone' in education; and DisabilityCare, which Labor could be better trusted to pursue; and the national broadband network. The retiring MP Nicola Roxon moved a condolence motion marking the death of Hazel Hawke. The Foreign Minister Bob Carr faced a question on asylum seekers. He said circumstances had changed, and there were now more economic migrants. A motion by Labor backbencher Laura Smyth calling for more definition on the no advantage test - the test which is supposed to ensure that asylum seekers aren't any better off as a result of paying a people smuggler - was lost on the voices. The Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, spoke against the Smyth motion. Why McLeod at the IPA event? Sir G.J. Coles was the IPA's first chairman in 1943. The last week of the 43rd parliament is crammed with business - parliamentary and social. Tomorrow evening is the annual back tie dinner for the mining industry. The Institute of Public Affairs is also throwing on some cocktails tomorrow evening in one of the private dining rooms in celebration of its 70th anniversary. Special guests for the IPA do include Ian Mcleod, the managing director of Coles; and Miranda Devine - columnist for News Limited. The Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey also gave an interesting speech to CEDA last night. My colleague Lenore Taylor has filed a short piece on the Hockey comments. Given the Coalition's front-and-centre political attacks on Labor's record of debt and deficits - it might surprise some readers to learn that Hockey is thinking about economic stimulus. (Contingency planning. It's the uncertainty, stupid.) Here's Lenore: The shadow treasurer, Joe Hockey, has acknowledged that a Coalition government might have to deliver economic stimulus during a downturn. The Coalition has repeatedly attacked Labor for \u201cwasteful spending\u201d and for presiding over deficits in comparison with the surpluses of the Howard government years, often erasing the stimulus spending during the 2008 global financial crisis from its analysis. But in a speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia on Monday night Hockey conceded that \u201cwell-considered government action could be appropriate\u201d if Australia\u2019s economy slowed further. \u201cI would not be doing my job if I had not already given some thought as to how economic activity could be safeguarded should the downturn in the private sector become more protracted,\u201d Hockey said. \u201cAustralia has not experienced a significant downturn in over 20 years and I am determined that it will not occur on my watch if we are elected on September 14. Protracted downturns in economic activity are very damaging in terms of lost output and lost jobs and it can take a very long time for the damage to be made good. The CEDA conference we mentioned on politics live yesterday is continuing in Canberra this morning. Here's an excerpt from a speech given this morning by the Treasurer Wayne Swan. The high Australian dollar - a double edged sword. There\u2019s no doubt the high Australian dollar has checked the growth of manufacturing in Australia as well as important service export industries such as tourism. It\u2019s obviously also hurt our farmers and hit profitability in mining. So it\u2019s good to see the Australian dollar depreciating, as it should as our terms of trade weaken and as the US begins the very long journey back to normal monetary policy settings. This should make the transition towards non-mining sources of growth a bit easier, although even at current levels it is still putting a handbrake on activity in some sectors. But we can also acknowledge that the higher dollar has increased the real incomes of Australians and helped keep inflation contained, helping the RBA to take interest rates down to record low levels. With a cheap currency, I doubt we could have got through such a big investment boom without high inflation and higher interest rates. Instead, we\u2019ve been able to successfully manage the investment boom without feeling a lot of the pressures we experienced in earlier commodity price booms such as the early 70s and 80s. So as we begin this new period of transition, we should take confidence in the fact that we\u2019ve already come through some extraordinary economic events in very good shape. I knit, therefore I am. (Actually I don't knit. Perhaps I'm jealous of fashionable types who do.) Now to knitting. Personally I think a day spent talking about whether the Prime Minister's decision to do a photo shoot with The Australian Women's Weekly involving her knitting a kangaroo for a far away prince or princess was a strategic blunder, or communications genius, is proof we've entered end times. That the national conversation is all symbols and portents, and zero substance. Perhaps it was just last night's episode of the ABC's Q&amp;A program that has pushed me over the edge into some stage of extreme humourlessness - or perhaps it's weeks of saturation coverage of issues that lack actual verbs - or perhaps I've just woken up grumpy. But anyway - who cares what I think. The Twitters are alight with knitting analogies and laments about how Labor stuffs everything up. Of course the picture is twee. Beyond that, I'm struggling to be outraged. I'll give Christopher Pyne the quick pick up of the morning however. This arch takedown is not bad at all. We know the Prime Minister is good at spinning a yarn and now we have photographic proof of it. Let the unravellings begin. I didn't catch all of the Manager of Opposition Business Christopher Pyne's press conference on the doors of parliament house this morning but I think his rationale for the split on the Senate vote last night was the Coalition intended to highlight the \"no\" case on this proposed change, as well as the \"yes\" case. In some not very genteel circles, this practice is referred to as talking out of both sides of your mouth. Truth is Nationals are supportive, dry Liberals are not supportive. Last night, the senate passed legislation which is the precursor for a referendum later in the year about recognising local government in the Constitution. The proposal passed - but divisions within the Coalition that have been bubbling way for some weeks boiled over. As the ABC has reported this morning: The result of the vote was 46 to 8. Seven Coalition senators voted against the bill, as did the Democratic Labor Party's John Madigan. At least a dozen others abstained, including Opposition Senate leader Eric Abetz, who protested the time limits on debate. Senator Abetz was joined outside the chamber by frontbenchers Michaelia Cash, Mathias Cormann, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Mitch Fifield, David Johnston, Michael Ronaldson and Scott Ryan. There is a strong conservative campaign against this change. It's interesting that Coalition frontbenchers defied the formal position on this policy - which is in support of recognition of local government. Only backbenchers generally exercise free votes. The discord will make the reform much harder to achieve. We are very conservative about Constitutional change in this country. Referenda generally only succeed with rock-solid bipartisanship. Today marks the final meeting of the Labor caucus for this parliament - at least we believe so at this time. The Prime Minister will attend that meeting this morning before flying to Sydney for Hazel Hawke's funeral. The Coalition will also have the final joint party room meeting of this parliament. Tony Abbott will attend that meeting, and be in Canberra for the day. His deputy, Julie Bishop, will be the Coalition's representative at Hazel Hawke's funeral. With so much smoke and mirrors around about the Labor leadership, Guardian Australia political editor Lenore Taylor has complied a useful Q&amp;A style explainer on what might or might not be going on. If you'd like to read that in full, you can find it here. Lenore has boiled the current imbroglio down to six questions in the what, when, where, how mode. My view? It's too soon to say how this week will end. That's the only certainty right now. It could all come to something, or nothing. In the meantime we press on. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the final sitting week of the 43rd parliament. The trajectory of the Labor leadership story remains clear as .. mud. Some papers say it\u2019s on, others say it\u2019s off. There will be a pause in the hostilities in any case as politics notes the passing of the inspirational Hazel Hawke at a state funeral in Sydney this morning. Mike Bowers has the flags of parliament house at half mast this morning. Let\u2019s walk through the main stories in politics today. Polls, because you can never have enough Julia Gillard's attempts to ignite a gender war against Tony Abbott have failed, with the Prime Minister's personal support crashing to record lows and the Opposition Leader now matching her standing among women. A quarterly analysis of Newspoll surveys also reveals that Mr Abbott is almost as popular among female voters as the nation's preferred prime minister, coming within four percentage points of Ms Gillard, the closest for two years. (The Australian, paywalled) Labor is on track to lose up to 35 of its 71\u2009seats at the federal election, including nine held by ministers, according to an exclusive new poll of the party\u2019s most vulnerable electorates. The poll of the 47\u2009Labor seats held by a margin of 12\u2009per cent or less shows there has been a nationwide 7.6\u2009per cent two-party-preferred swing against the ALP in these seats since the August 2010 election. It suggests Labor\u2019s position would improve should Kevin Rudd supplant Julia Gillard as leader but, at the same time, a majority does not believe there should be a leadership change. (Australian Financial Review, paywalled) Greg Combet \u201creportedly\u201d cuts deal with Rudd Climate Change Minister Greg Combet reportedly told Kevin Rudd 18 months ago that, if a leadership change was to happen, he wanted to become treasurer as part of the deal. The conversation, in which Mr Combet was reported to have expressed frustration at Prime Minister Julia Gillard's handling of the carbon tax debate, is said to have taken place in Mr Rudd's office at the end of 2011, just months before the first challenge to Ms Gillard's leadership. (The Daily Telegraph) But Rudd\u2019s gotta zip for Beijing Kevin Rudd has booked an international flight to China on Thursday afternoon to speak at a conference in Beijing on Friday in a move that could bring forward the deadline to resolve Labor's leadership crisis before parliament rises. (The Australian, paywalled) Julia Gillard knits kangaroo and gets interviewed by top selling women\u2019s mag She is both a republican and a trail-blazing feminist, but Julia Gillard has chosen to portray \"a different\" side of herself to the electorate, revealing she is knitting a toy kangaroo for the royal baby, due next month. In a candid interview to be published tomorrow, the Prime Minister reflects on what she hopes will be her legacy. She posed with her knitting needles and her dog Reuben in a shoot for The Australian Women's Weekly, admitting that the experience felt \"slightly absurd\". (The Australian, paywalled) Then everyone starts talking about it The #PM will appear in the Women's Weekly tomorrow knitting a baby kangaroo for the royal baby. What's the strangest thing you've knitted? (ABC 774 Melbourne) People smuggler boasts of exploits on camera An Indonesian former policeman turned people smuggler has been caught on a hidden camera referring to asylum seekers as ''goats'' and boasting of how he bribed police to turn a blind eye to his operation. The man, Freddy Ambon, is one of Indonesia's most active people smugglers, and boasts of sending multiple boats per month to Christmas Island, charging refugees between $5000 and $6000 for the journey. He also talks about a boat he helped arrange last year which sank, killing 96 people. The tragedy prompted a fierce parliamentary debate in Australia, and ultimately forced Labor to reverse its position and reopen Nauru and Manus Island detention centres. (Fairfax Media/ABC) Groundhog day - peppered with goodbyes Leaden skies and a gelid rain falling on the national capital. Another day of pointless argy bargy in Question Time, another week in prospect of pointless speculation about the Labor leadership, another series of valedictory speeches from pollies who, for one reason or another, have decided it is time to get out. And worse, it seems like mostly the good ones are leaving. (The Global Mail) What would Malcolm Tucker do? As the caucus counts down to what many Labor MPs anticipate could be a high noon later this week, it seemed perfectly appropriate that Alastair Campbell, former spin doctor to Tony Blair, should turn up for a meeting with Julia Gillard, and then start spinning.
