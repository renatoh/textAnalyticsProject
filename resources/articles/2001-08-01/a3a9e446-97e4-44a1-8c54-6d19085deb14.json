Robicheaux resides on a bayou in New Iberia, near New Orleans, its ecology of rolling lightning storms, flaming marsh gas and purple sunsets inspiring constant descriptions of similarly florid beauty. Holland has, in Bitterroot, left Texas for the clear streams and cloud-touching green mountains of Missoula, Montana. These are Burke's two homes, too. The dark pasts and bleakly encroaching presents these men and places reveal are also uncomfortably close to their author's life. Robicheaux is an alcoholic with a tendency to blacked-out violence, while Burke's alcoholism crippled his life and career till 1977, when the 12-Step Programme Robicheaux also undertakes saved him from psychic horror so deep that he reportedly considered a lobotomy. Holland's family, meanwhile, is based on that of Burke's mother, including a great-grandfather whose murderous gunfighting in the post-Civil War South is described from his diaries in Lay Down My Sword and Shield (1971). Historic and individual crimes don't stay buried in Burke's America. Its bayous are peppered with Confederate bullets; lynched skeletons float to the surface; withered killers still stalk the land; Custer's death graphically haunts an Indian's dreams. Meanwhile, petrochemical interests poison the vegetation Burke labours to describe in these Edens that were corrupted from the start. Burke was born in 1937, in Houston, Texas, moving to Louisiana soon after. Catholic nuns' stories, a travelling rural library and the example of his cousin, the late short-story writer Andre Dubus, inspired him to write. As in his books, he can recall this lost America clearly. \"I was born in the Depression, and the country was a different place. Houston is like New York down on the plains now. But then, we lived on a dead-end street. Radios played all the time in the windows of people's houses. There were trees on the street and at its end, cane break and a farmer's pasture, with oak trees in it that were maybe 150 years old. That was an urban setting then. That America is pretty well gone. My generation is a transitional one, we're more like our predecessors than we are younger people. We stand at a crossroads, historically.\" Robicheaux, too, almost Burke's age, seems to face in two directions when he investigates - Confederate and Civil Rights ghosts dancing in his head, even as rapacious businessmen creep into sight. \"Dave believes, as I do, that history is sequential,\" Burke says. \"The world is claimed in many ways legitimately by the dead; we stand on their shoulders. You cannot compartmentalise historical events. They have a way of coming back, and biting you in the heel.\" As a newspaperman in the early 1960s, Burke saw the times' violent ferment first-hand. Cadillac Jukebox (1996) is his best attempt to understand how those years have lingered into the present, through the figure of Aaron Crown. \"Poor white trash\" who once killed a civil-rights leader, Crown moves naively through a modern day of crack-cursed ghettos and corporate crime. \"Crown's the saw-tooth on the edge of the blade,\" Burke says. \"The hatreds in him were engendered by far more intelligent people. Leaders who kill hundreds and lose little sleep, and some salespeople and mid-level management, are emotionally little different from those we call psychopaths and lock in cages. Some people are simply evil, of their own volition. They reach a juncture, and deliberately murder all light in their own souls. I've looked into eyes like that. They're of a different species.\" But Burke's books have been more deeply informed by the darkness he's seen in himself. Early critical success with his debut, Half of Paradise (1965), leaked away, till he had to wait 13 years for the publication of his fourth novel, The Lost Get-Back Boogie (1986). During that time, he experienced alcoholic terrors he can hardly describe. \"It was a combination of three psychological conditions,\" he says. \"Psycho-neurotic anxiety, which is like having your skin taken off with pliers, agitated depression, when a person smashes his fists into bricks and cuts his palms with his nails, and obsessive-compulsive behaviour, when he cannot free himself from his bonds. Put that together and it's like being in a black box full of electricity. It has no exit, and people stick guns in their mouths, or they get drunk again, and maybe they should. I tried to describe it in the story of Dave Robicheaux, in Black Cherry Blues (1989) in particular. But no one who has not been there can understand it. It's a place from which you think you will never extricate yourself. Going to the wrong, naive person for help is like going to a shoe salesman when you've got a brain tumour. But if you go into a 12-step, suddenly you hear people speaking the same language.\" In Sunset Limited (1998), confronting alcoholism is equated with confronting one's past. It makes the personal salvation of Robicheaux, and Burke, sound similar to the unveiling of America's enduring evils which both men attempt. \"Robicheaux always indicates it's the truth that sets us free,\" Burke agrees. \"It doesn't matter on what level. Today, in the State Capitol of Mississippi, there are framed photos of black workers being beaten. Now at least those crimes are in plain sight.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
