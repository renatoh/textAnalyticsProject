Yet a good deal is happening, most of it presumably as the result of the Suez crisis. The Iraqis have been making overtures to their rival, Saudi Arabia; Syria and the Lebanese unite in saying they fear that French troops in Cyprus means a plan for their reoccupation by France; Saudi Arabia has called a military conference of Arab states at Riyadh. There are currents and cross-currents, one being the Arab fear of Israel. But it is a reasonable supposition that the Arab governments are finding themselves under some pressure of public opinion to rally to Egypt's support. The Suez crisis may thus be giving a new impetus to Arab unification, and this will be very much to the satisfaction of President Nasser. Some non-Egyptian leaders would like to use the crisis for the purpose of reducing Nasser's rising prestige. They see in him the Bismarck of a United Arabia, and try to stem the national tide. If President Nasser was seen to be slipping from favour because he was making no more headway, or because his countrymen were beginning to feel the economic pinch, some Arab leaders would not be sorry to see him in decline. Their position would be very different if he was directly attacked by western forces. There would be an instant appeal to other Arab states, especially Iraq, to stop the flow of oil \"which feeds the Anglo-French tanks and bombers shedding sacred Arab blood\". The oil would stop, and the flow of oil revenues would stop too. Some people would be hit directly by that, many more indirectly. For the oil revenues are the basis of construction and development in which thousands find employment. The unemployed would demonstrate; demonstrations would grow into riots; governments would try to divert anger from themselves by laying all the blame on \"the imperialists\". What is left of the influence of the Baghdad alliance (and we shall have to consider when the dust of Suez settles if enough is left worth keeping) would be swept away, and with it those in the Middle East who have given it their support. It is seen by Arab nationalists as a grouping meant to divide the Arab world and to keep Iraq at arm's length from Egypt. If, under stress of economic forces, the star of Egypt grew dimmer and that of Iraq brighter, that would open up a different prospect."}, "isHosted": false}}}
