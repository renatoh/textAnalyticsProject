Len McCluskey, the head of Unite, launched the outspoken attack after Labour began an official investigation into Young Labour members. The inquiry is being led by former Labour leader in the Lords, Jan Royall, who will look at the election of a youth representative for the NEC, won last weekend by the Labour First candidate Jasmin Beckett by a slender margin, amid accusations of intimidation from both sides. The party on Tuesday night decided not to rerun the election despite a formal request from James Elliott, the candidate who was supported by Unite. The position on the NEC has become highly sought-after because of the internal struggle between the party\u2019s right and left to control its ruling council. Both sides say that control of the party\u2019s NEC is crucial to deciding policies and future parliamentary candidates. One of the allegations made is that Unite delegates at the Young Labour conference in Scarborough were bullied into supporting James Elliott, the losing candidate. McCluskey issued a statement on Tuesday that described the claims as \u201can organised assault\u201d to \u201cundermine the Labour leadership\u201d. \u201cOn behalf of Unite I want to put on record how proud I am of our young members, and the professional way that they have conducted themselves during the Young Labour elections and conference,\u201d he said \u201cThey put to shame those in our party whose conduct has been nothing short of disgraceful and confirm once again that some in our midst will stop at nothing, including destroying the reputation and hopes of our party\u2019s young activists, in their quest to undermine the Labour leadership.\u201d Elliott, an Oxford University history graduate, was beaten by Beckett, a student at the University of Liverpool, at a febrile Labour Youth conference in Scarborough. Beckett won with 49.55% of the vote, beating Elliott on 49.41%. In a formal complaint to the party obtained by the Guardian, Elliott said last weekend\u2019s election to become the party\u2019s youth representative on the national executive committee should be suspended. Solicitors for Elliott wrote to Iain McNicol, the party\u2019s general secretary, claiming that Elliott\u2019s supporters were stopped from voting by party officials, some of whom were supporters of Beckett. The letter claims: One supporter of Elliott was refused an opportunity to register due to being 20 minutes late to the conference because of an unexpected hospital visit. The delegate claims a party official told him he would only be eligible to cast his vote if had he been in \u201ca train crash\u201d. A delegate claimed he was \u201cbullied and harassed\u201d by Beckett\u2019s supporters, forcing him to leave the conference venue. Another eligible delegate who supported Elliott was denied a ballot paper without being given a valid reason. Six Elliott-supporting delegates were ruled rejected by the returning officer, without a proper reason being given. Named Labour party staff members canvassed for Beckett before the election, in breach of party rules. Elliott\u2019s demand for a recount was denied by a Labour official and \u201cno valid reasons were offered for the denial\u201d and there was no review of many spoilt ballot papers. The letter also refers to an outstanding complaint sent to the party last week by a Scottish delegate that claimed that Beckett had wrongly smeared Elliott as antisemitic and encouraged her supporters to smear him on social media. \u201cIn these circumstances, it is unthinkable that the winner of the election, Jasmin Beckett, should take up her seat on the NEC pending a full and comprehensive inquiry into the lead-up to and the circumstances of the election,\u201d the letter concludes. Royall\u2019s inquiry is also examining claims of antisemitism against Elliott \u2013 claims he vehemently denies. Beckett has not responded to a request for a comment. However, writing for the Labour List website, Beckett said the complaints needed to be investigated and that the weekend\u2019s conference was not \u201cour movement at its best\u201d. She continued: \u201cFactionalism, grievance and outside interference from people who were neither young nor delegates made it difficult for too many. This has got to stop. \u201cI am a working-class woman from Liverpool \u2026 Growing up, life did not seem fair. I got angry. I got into fights. And eventually I was expelled from school. \u201cI ran away from home and was taken back to my mum by the police. Wirral Young Labour taught me that the anger I felt at society could be channelled into fighting for social justice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
