With Wayne Rooney out with a fractured foot, Peter Crouch suspended for the Israel game, Andrew Johnson out of sorts and Alan Smith being deployed as a midfielder by Newcastle, McClaren will not be overjoyed by Allardyce's prognosis. Dyer's injury further reduces his options, with the England coach keen to use the West Ham player as an auxiliary striker. Dyer's injury came as a result of a challenge from the Rovers left winger Joe Jacobson that the West Ham manager Alan Curbishley suggested was reckless. \"We are so devastated for him,\" Curbishley said of Dyer, the club's \u00a36m summer signing. \"I can't put it into words, really. The game was immaterial after that. \"I think the Bristol Rovers player has got to be very disappointed with his tackle. As far as I can see he has lashed out after losing the ball and caught Kieron in a difficult area.\" McClaren needs an in-form Owen, especially if Steven Gerrard is not fit, as England would then be unable to push the Anfield captain forward from midfield and deploy him as a second, deep-lying, striker. Unfortunately for McClaren, Allardyce believes England's coach may need to be patient with Owen. \"I've no doubt in my mind that, if Michael stays injury free, then, in the space of a few months he'll gradually start improving game in, game out and the goals and confidence will start to flow from there,\" Newcastle's manager said. Owen, who has made brief appearances as a substitute in the Premier League games against Aston Villa and Middlesbrough, is expected to start at home to Barnsley in the Carling Cup tonight. \"Michael's not been left out [so far], he's just not been fit enough to be selected,\" Allardyce added. After missing virtually all of the last campaign with a ruptured cruciate knee ligament, Owen seems vulnerable to strains and pulls and Allardyce said: \"We are all keeping our fingers crossed that we've seen the last of Michael's injury problems. He has always looked after himself but after his long rehabilitation [from the cruciate] Michael knows he has to look after himself even better now.\" Allardyce believes Owen will benefit psychologically once he starts scoring again. \"Injuries as serious as that change people's lives. Players see the dangers they face each week playing football,\" he said. \"Michael's still getting in the right position and he's not lost that instinct but now it's just about him putting the ball in the back of the net as quickly as he can and going from there.\" Owen yesterday conceded he was unhappy with his contribution during England's 2-1 defeat against Germany last week and said: \"It was disappointing. I would not say I was happy with my performance - I missed two chances. I am fit, it's just sharpness I lack.\" Yet, unlike Allardyce, Owen feels he is merely \"two or three full games away\" from returning to his old predatory self. England will play a fresh Israel side in the qualifier on September 8 after the Israeli Football Association postponed their league campaign this weekend to give the players a rest with an eye on the national team's visit to Wembley."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
