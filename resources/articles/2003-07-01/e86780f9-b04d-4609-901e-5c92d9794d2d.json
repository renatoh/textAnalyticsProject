His brand of revelatory undercover reporting depends on subterfuge and disguise - most frequently as an Arab millionaire - and the News of the World has never printed a photograph of its \"legendary\" reporter. His methods have delivered many classic Sunday tabloid stories, but have courted an equal amount of controversy. June 2003 The trial of five men accused of plotting to kidnap Victoria Beckham collapses after it is revealed the key witness was paid \u00a315,000 to co-operate with Mahmood, who broke the story. The case is referred to the attorney general, though the press complaints commission takes no action. 2002 Mahmood is involved in establishing evidence that Prince Harry smoked cannabis. Instead of complaining to the PCC, St James's Palace struck a deal with the NoW. 2001 Sophie Wessex and her business partner agreed to meet Mahmood, posing as an Arab sheikh, at a London hotel. She proceeded to unleash a series of indiscreet remarks about the royal family that ended her PR career. John Fashanu John Fashanu began his career in 1983 aged 19 at Norwich City. In contrast to his lavishly gifted brother Justin, who hanged himself in 1998, his greatest assets were his strength and aggression, both of which found an outlet at Wimbledon. Fashanu joined them in 1986, taking his place in a team of notoriously uncompromising players including Vinnie Jones and Dennis Wise. Fashanu helped Wimbledon win the 1988 cup final. In 1994 he almost faced legal action after he elbowed Tottenham's Gary Mabbutt in the face, fracturing his eye socket and cheekbone. Fashanu retired in 1996 following a knee injury and moved into television, presenting Gladiators. His role in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here prompted ITV1 to hire him to present Man Versus Beast, in which humans will compete against animals. The show is scheduled to appear later this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
