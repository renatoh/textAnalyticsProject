While the home side spent 33 minutes in possession compared with the visitors' 20, Scotland had the ball more often in their opponents' 22. England tended to attack from deep and, lacking a specialist open\u2011side flanker, found themselves too often outnumbered at the breakdown, and their error count amounted to 29% of the possession they won. They were unable to sustain pressure, apart from the period when John Barclay was in the sin-bin, when it needed the coolness of Jonny Wilkinson to prompt the opening for the decisive score. Scotland proved that the set piece isn't everything Scotland did exceptionally well to go into the interval level at 9-9 having been largely starved of set-piece possession. They claimed just two lineouts in the opening period \u2013 Ross Ford's first three throws failed to find their target \u2013 and all the scrum yielded was penalties and free-kicks to England as Allan Jacobsen and Moray Low discovered that the referee, Romain Poite, had a low tolerance threshold for front rowers under pressure. When Poite was helped off in the third quarter, Scotland stopped being blown at the scrum. That they were still in the game by then was down to their defence and scavenging ability at the breakdown. After trying to match England for passes in the opening minutes, Scotland settled into a smash-and-grab routine, playing for territory and ended up kicking half their ball. The grand slam decider in Dublin will all come down to defence The England team manager, Martin Johnson, acknowledged that compliments were being paid to his team, largely because of the manner of their victories this season over Australia and Italy when the stereotype of English strategy revolving around set-pieces was shattered. England may have scored 12 tries this Six Nations, more than any other side, but they have conceded only three and they did not miss one tackle on Sunday. Their grand slam victory in 2003 was their last win in Dublin. Ireland are second to England in the try table with eight and Johnson's men will need to be as tight as they were here to win. They will also be mindful of the way Ireland force turnovers, one player holding up the ball-carrier, preventing him going to ground, and another ripping the ball."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
