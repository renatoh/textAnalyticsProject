Tour\u00e9 had a public dispute with the champions due to disquiet over the lack of club celebrations for his birthday, a couple of days after City won the Premier League title. Tour\u00e9, who is with Ivory Coast for the Africa Cup of Nations, which starts on Saturday, was asked if he wanted to stay at City. \u201cThat\u2019s a big question and that\u2019s an easy question as well, and you have an easy answer \u2013 we\u2019ll see,\u201d the 31-year-old told CNN. Pressed if he would be at City next season, Tour\u00e9 said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m at City at the moment.\u201d These comments were put to Pellegrini and the manager claimed: \u201cYaya is 100% committed with our team and with this team. I don\u2019t have any doubts about that.\u201d But asked why the Ivorian would admit he could leave if he was committed to the club, Pellegrini said: \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us know what will happen in six months more. We don\u2019t know where you can be. We cannot know what will happen in the future. It\u2019s not a problem with his commitment.\u201d The Chilean tried to shrug off the idea that Tour\u00e9\u2019s comments were related to last summer\u2019s dispute over his birthday and a perceived lack of recognition for the midfielder. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t link one thing with the other. I repeat Yaya is very happy here. His commitment with our club is not a problem.\u201d City host Arsenal on Sunday and Pellegrini revealed that if the timing had been different he might have considered signing Alexis S\u00e1nchez, who joined the Gunners in July. \u201cIt was not easy. He was a very expensive player in that moment. In the moment Barcelona sold him to Arsenal we were not searching for one striker because we had in that moment Jovetic, Ag\u00fcero, Negredo and Dzeko but I am sure Alexis can play everywhere,\u201d the manager said. Of the qualities of the striker, who has scored 12 Premier League goals, Pellegrini said: \u201cAlexis is a very good player, he is doing a very good season in England. It is not easy for a player in his first season here to score so many goals. Alexis is repeating what he did in the last two seasons at Barcelona and scoring a lot of goals.\u201d City\u2019s 1-1 draw with Everton last weekend allowed Chelsea to take a two-point lead in the chase for the championship. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we dropped two points or if we won one,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cIt is difficult to know about that. Last year we draw here against Sunderland and it was a very important point to go on and win the title. We have to play 17 games more and that is 51 points. I think that 51 and 47 are 98. \u201cWe can drop points and win the title. I am sure that all the teams will drop points between now and the end of the year. The less you drop, the better but it is important to try to recover to the top of the table in this month.\u201d City\u2019s \u00a325m signing of Tour\u00e9\u2019s countryman Wilfried Bony was questioned by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Chelsea\u2019s manager said: \u201cGood striker. If they have the money and no problems with FFP, well done. Rules are different for City.\u201d Predictably, Pellegrini refused to comment. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he said, so I cannot talk about that. Financial things are the same for all the teams,\u201d he said. Sergio Ag\u00fcero is now fully recovered following a knee injury. \u201cYes, he is working with the squad every day so he doesn\u2019t have any problems. We will see if he starts but he is 100 % fit,\u201d said Pellegrini. Samir Nasri, though, has a calf injury which means the midfielder will not play against his old club. \u201cHe will be out around three weeks or a month,\u201d the manager said before offering an update on Vincent Kompany and Edin Dzeko, who were each recently injured. \u201cVincent is 100% fit. He will be OK without problems. We have some doubts about Edin. We must wait to see what the doctor says, what the player says and then we will decide.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
