Hang on a minute, as you were, no they weren't, Monty having asked the media specifically not to say this sad state of affairs is going on. Instead, it appears that the veteran Scot and the Belfast phenom have a slight difference of opinion when it comes to summing up what the big match is all about. First, McIlroy: \"The Ryder Cup is a great spectacle but an exhibition at the end of the day and it should be there to be enjoyed. In the big scheme of things it's not that important to me.\" Crikey. When this was relayed to the captain he did not actually snort but he did go awfully serious, as only he can. \"The Ryder Cup is most definitely not an exhibition. Having played in it, having experienced the emotion and the stress of it, I can assure you of that. Indeed if I manage to lead Europe to victory next year it will be the greatest achievement of my career. Now look, don't try to build this up into some sort of big row between me and Rory.\" Oh, OK then. What remains interesting, however, is that McIlroy's summation of the European Tour's most important cash cow coincides almost exactly with what Tiger Woods thinks of the whole shebang. Hardly surprising, given that Wee Mac has followed Woods' philosophy as only a young, besotted lad can. He and Monty can develop their debate over the next 48 hours as they are paired in the opening rounds of this 3 Irish Open. This playing together is part of Montgomerie's brief from the Tournament Players Committee when it offered him the job and which, this week, also offered him a compromise of three captain's picks. \"The committee wanted not just a younger captain but someone who was still on the circuit and who could really keep an eye on all the contenders,\" said Monty. Would he, I asked, consider stepping back from tournaments to concentrate on his captaincy if things do not begin to improve with his game? Apparently not. \"No, no, I wouldn't do that.\" We'll see. What is certain is that he will need something better than he has shown of late if he is to survive into the weekend here at the County Louth club in Baltray. This is one fine links and with a bitterly cold win hurling in off the Irish Sea and rain forecast, the tournament is going to be a lot things, but fun isn't one of them. Monty may well find himself concentrating too much on survival to chatter with McIlroy. With Padraig 'I've stopped tinkering, honest' Harrington also here and the likes of Lee Westwood, Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal in town this is the strongest Euro Tour event since Dubai three months ago. McIlroy won that one in some style, of course, and he goes into this tournament as the local hero. \"It's McIlroy for me,\" yelped the lad who took my toll money on the motorway yesterday. And a local hotel has tried to drum up some business by offering a full refund to anyone booking a room for four days if McIlroy pulls if off. If I was Rory, I'd try desperately hard to regard this as an exhibition match rather than one of the oldest and more significant titles in the game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
