The Paul Nicholls-trained runner, winner of the County Hurdle last season, has been made ante-post favourite for the Arkle Trophy but his supporters at Exeter suffered an anxious time when the grey stumbled on landing at the second fence, with Ruby Walsh having to use all his skill to stay in the saddle. The five-year-old recovered well and despite getting in close at the second-last fence he strolled home by 13 lengths. Ladbrokes responded by making the winner a 12-1 shot for his Festival target. Meanwhile, in a controversial move which could have important ramifications throughout the industry, the European Pattern Race committee yesterday gave the initial thumbs-up to the proposal to cut the distance of the French Derby from 12 to 10 furlongs. France Galop, the ruling body across the Channel, wants to change the distance of the race - the Prix du Jockey-Club - from the traditional mile and a half to the shorter trip among a number of changes to key races. The suggested changes have split the French racing community. Prominent figures such as the master trainer Andr\u00e9 Fabre are in favour while others including a key owner, the Aga Khan, and the top jockey Olivier Peslier are among 200 leading figures who have signed a petition opposing the plan There are fears that the France Galop proposals will discourage competition between the three-year-olds and older horses and have a major impact on high-profile races in Britain such as the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown and Ascot's King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes. \u00b7 Newcastle called a precautionary inspection for 7.30 today after heavy overnight rain was forecast."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
