Because that mic-drop soundtrack you can hear is the noise of the first glossy covers of the new decade hitting newsstands with a serious bang. Fashion has a new algorithm, and the new year now trumps the new season. The US edition of Vogue has no fewer than four covers, a quartet of portraits of motherhood by Annie Leibovitz. Stella McCartney is surrounded by all four of her children \u2013 the first time the McCartney kids have been seen in the limelight, and the first time a designer has covered US Vogue. Cardi B holds daughter Kulture on her lap, Greta Gerwig cuddles her baby son Harold, and Ashley Graham cradles a bump draped in gold Oscar de la Renta lam\u00e9. British Vogue\u2019s January cover stars Taylor Swift in a Chanel jacket, which might not sound all that groundbreaking \u2013 except it is, because the jacket is from the Chanel archives. A Vogue cover is the ultimate shop window for fashion brands, so to showcase a vintage piece that readers can\u2019t go out and buy is not just a strong fashion statement, but a strong cultural one as well. In his editor\u2019s letter, Edward Enninful calls the cover: \u201ca thoughtful template for what a more sustainable notion of luxury can look like.\u201d Cosmopolitan\u2019s UK cover is even more radical \u2013 Queer Eye\u2019s Jonathan Van Ness, who identifies as non-binary, is the first solo non-female cover star of the magazine in 35 years. As a triple-A-list cover star, Beyonc\u00e9 would once have insisted on the cachet of a September appearance \u2013 her last Vogue cover was for September 2018 \u2013 but for January 2020, she is the star of US Elle, shot by Queen &amp; Slim director Melina Matsoukas, her Lemonade collaborator. The interview, which coincides with a relaunch of Ivy Park, celebrates Beyonc\u00e9 as being the only African-American woman with 100% ownership of an athleisure brand. And, for an athleisure brand, a January moment in the limelight makes a lot of sense. January is when gym memberships are bought \u2013 and the kit to go with them. (And Vogue cover girl Stella McCartney, don\u2019t forget, helms a commercially successful Adidas line which is a key element in her empire.) The tradition of September as fashion\u2019s new year is a legacy of a crumbling power structure. The days when that month\u2019s issues contained the first reveal of autumn\u2019s fashion are long gone \u2013 these days, every look from the autumn shows is on Instagram as it hits the catwalk, six months earlier. Fashion has shifted from a biannual model to more frequent \u201cdrops\u201d \u2013 the cruise collections, which arrive in stores in November rather than August, now account for the bulk of what used to be autumn/winter retail. The style calendar is now dictated by the life moments thatconsumers deem important, rather than structured around a timetable that happens to suit retailers. (January issues happen to land in mid-December, just in time for Christmas and New Year dress-up.) The mood music of the new year \u2013 of fitness and dry January, fresh starts and good intentions \u2013 harmonises sweetly with fashion as it shifts towards wellness, grapples with sustainability, and flirts with activism. In tandem with their January issues, all 26 editors of Vogues around the world co-signed a mission statement of \u201cVogue Values\u201d, pledging \u201cto be socially responsible, to represent people from all backgrounds, and to have a strong voice on current affairs on global issues.\u201d Anna Wintour flagged the significance of her Stella McCartney January cover, lauding \u201cher pioneering work around fashion and sustainability\u201d. September \u2013 yoked to red-blooded consumerism, and slavishly echoing the academic year \u2013 seems old-fashioned by comparison. The bleakest, darkest, most joyless of months just got a seriously glossy makeover. January is so hot right now. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 December 2019 to clarify that Jonathan Van Ness is Cosmopolitan\u2019s first solo non-female cover star in 35 years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
