Photograph: Dan Chung/Guardian Welcome to Fat Tuesday. With Lent beginning tomorrow, the carnival season is coming to a climax today - and in some parts of the world, that means the last fevered surge of party time. This year, there has been a lot of interest in Mardis Gras, and reports from New Orleans show that despite the city remaining in mourning six months after Hurricane Katrina, the celebration has gone ahead undeterred. Guardian photographer Dan Chung has sent these photographs back from the city. Mardi Gras has, inevitably, been smaller in scale this year, but theAssociated Press (AP) reports today that of the 1,882 restaurants in the city before Katina, 506 were open this week, which is quite remarkable when you remember how much devastation was caused. Crowds were smaller than usual, but turnout was still impressive as the city tried to rebuild its tourist industry. In Rio de Janeiro, the party is as big as ever. In the city yesterday some 4,000 exotic dancers entertained around 70,000 carnival revellers. Presumably, though, security has been stepped up at the city's museums after a gang of six thieves capitalised on the distraction of carnival last Friday to steal works by Monet, Matisse and Picasso. Carnival is thought to have its origins in the Roman Catholic church, and is celebrated in most countries around the world that have significant Catholics communities. Revellers in Germany call the event Fasching, and there are celebrations in cities including Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf and Mainz. Wikipedia has a good list of carnivals around the world, including those in C\u00e1diz, in Spain, and Venice, in Italy. The carnival season is usually the two weeks leading up to Lent. Some people believe carnival developed as a way for people in cultures that were otherwise repressive to let off steam, and say they are not necessarily a good thing; others think they are absolutely brilliant. The Russian scholar Mikhail Bakhtin was very interested in carnivals and what he called the carnivalesque, which he linked closely to grotesqueness. He believed carnivals were characterised by \"moments of death and revival\". Today is also, of course, Shrove Tuesday, which obviously means pancakes. Sitting writing this in an office in London on a cold February, it is a bit of a stretch to imagine the Bacchanalian debauchery going on at the big carnival destinations, but in the spirit of carnival solidarity I went a bit crazy this lunchtime and had a ginger beer. News blog would welcome comments from anyone who has a slightly more impressive carnival experience to relate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
