To add to the midfielder's embarrassment, Prutton's parents had travelled down from Hull to watch him play. It is not known whether parental admonishment contributed to the 23-year-old's decision to apologise publicly to the referee Alan Wiley, his assistant, the fans and Arsenal's midfielder Robert Pires, who bore the brunt of the crass tackle that earned Prutton's second yellow card. But even the player is expecting a lengthy ban for pushing Wiley - even though he insists that, in his fury at the red card, he did not even know it was the referee he was pushing. \"It could have been anyone,\" he said. \"It was one of those out-of control moments I've got to learn from.\" The first charge against Prutton relates to his failure to leave the field of play promptly following his dismissal and his attempt to remonstrate with the assistant referee, during which he pushed the referee on at least one occasion. The second charge relates to threatening behaviour towards a match official. \"I was stupid,\" Prutton said. \"I should have known that but I could only see it when I saw the reaction of my family and friends afterwards. I'm not proud of it at all. I honestly don't know what came over me. This was one of those moments when you feel completely out of control. \"But I know now I am in the wrong and I will take whatever the FA decide to give me. With hindsight I should have kept my mouth shut and got down the tunnel.\" The Southampton manager Harry Redknapp, who had to drag Prutton away from the officials, said: \"When I saw him afterwards with his family I've rarely seen anybody look so down.\" Oldham Athletic are expected to name Ronnie Moore as their new manager following the departure last week of Brian Talbot. The former Rotherham United manager is likely to agree a deal to the end of the season. Everton have agreed a deal with Cambridge United to sign their 18-year-old goalkeeper John Ruddy at the end of the season. The player will be offered a two-year contract. Billy Turley has been sacked by Rushden and Diamonds for gross misconduct after being found guilty of taking cocaine. The 31-year-old was given a six-month ban by the FA after testing positive for the substance last week. Hearts have been paired with the favourites and holders Celtic in the Tennent's Scottish Cup semi-finals. In the other tie, Hibernian have been paired with Dundee United. - PA"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
