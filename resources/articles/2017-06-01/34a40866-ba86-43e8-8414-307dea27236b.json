The 31\u2011year\u2011old Spaniard\u2019s 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 victory against Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland made him the first man to win any of the grand slam events 10 times, a feat he achieved without dropping a single set. \u201cThis has been, I think, a perfect Roland Garros for me,\u201d said Nadal, who dropped just 35 games in total on his way to a 15th grand slam title but his first for three years. Nadal was shown a montage of his 10 victories before the trophy presentation and said the historic nature of the triumph added to his satisfaction. \u201cIt is true that this one is going to be one of the more special for the number, for what happened on the ceremony after the final, for so many things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because I am 31 already and not a kid any more. Today was a very important day for me. [There] have been some tough moments last times, injuries, so it\u2019s great to have big success like this again.\u201d Nadal said when he first won the title in 2005 he would not have imagined he would still be playing in 2017, let alone winning, and said 10 titles had a special ring to it. \u201cAs I like to say, if I can do it, someone else can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you need the right circumstances, the right ingredients to win 10 French Open titles. I don\u2019t know if I will ever get to meet the player who will do better than I did. It has been very special to me, and it\u2019s true that it is unprecedented. Trust me, I\u2019m very happy that I\u2019m the one who did it. I\u2019m very happy.\u201d Wawrinka, who lost a grand slam final for the first time, said he had been beaten by a man at the peak of his game. \u201cFor sure he\u2019s playing the best he\u2019s ever played,\u201d Wawrinka said. \u201cBut not only here. I think since the beginning of the year, you can see he\u2019s playing more aggressive, staying more close [to] the line. But that\u2019s clearly the best he has ever played. That\u2019s why he\u2019s winning so much again.\u201d The Swiss said he had recovered well physically from the effort of defeating Andy Murray in a semi-final which lasted more than four and a half hours, but that mentally the efforts of the past few weeks had caught up with him. \u201cFrom the beginning from my side, for sure, I didn\u2019t play my best tennis,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I was a little bit hesitating with my selection of shots. I was always a little bit between [thoughts]. One, because I play against him and he puts this doubt in your head when you play against him because he\u2019s playing so well. And second, all the effort I have been doing [in the] last few weeks to get to my best level again, to get some confidence again, and to win all those matches \u2026 some tough matches.\u201d Wawrinka said the positives of the fortnight outweighed the negatives of losing a grand slam final, having shrugged off a poor clay-court season to make the final for the second time in three years. Nadal\u2019s 10th win, he said, was an incredible achievement. \u201cIt\u2019s something tough to describe when you just say you won 10 French Opens,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a grand slam, but it\u2019s the same grand slam. That\u2019s something so big for the sport. He\u2019s the best-ever player on clay.\u201d Nadal said his chances at Wimbledon, where he has not won since 2010, depended on how his aching knees respond on the grass. \u201cIf I have pain in the knees, then I know from experience that it\u2019s almost impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I need to feel strong, low and powerful legs to play well in Wimbledon. If I don\u2019t feel that, then probably my chances are not there, no? But if I am healthy and I am able to have the right preparation and feel healthy during Wimbledon, then I am probably going to have my chances to play well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
