Nowhere more so than the gruelling world of ballet. But could it be that the principal taskmasters have asked a bit too much in the past of the top performers? The question arises from the new book by Daria Klimentov\u00e1, a former prima ballerina at the English National Ballet (ENB), who repeats her contentious recollection of the day she told Derek Deane, the then artistic director, that she was pregnant. He, you may recall, gained some notoriety when his robust route to excellence was highlighted in a fly-on-the-wall documentary. \"My pregnancy was confirmed by the doctor,\" writes Klimentov\u00e1. \"So I then had to go and tell Derek. His first reaction amazed me. I was happily married and approaching 30, and yet he asked me immediately, 'Are you going to keep it?' I suppose that I shouldn't have been so shocked. Derek had given his life to ballet. To him, this child was an inconvenience, and he showed it. I did not feel any sentiment, caring or understanding; he was just irritated that I wouldn't be available to dance as Aurora in his new production. Funnily enough, his reaction didn't upset me, it just shocked me.\" Shocking indeed. But does he remember it differently? \u2022 Deane, whose new ENB production of Swan Lake premieres at the Royal Albert Hall in June, does indeed have a different take. \"I remember the conversation very well,\" he tells us. \"She came to me to say she was expecting a child. I said 'are you sure this is the right time for you privately and professionally to be having a baby. I am about to do Sleeping Beauty and your career is taking off. What do you really want?' She said I want to have the baby, so I said you have to be very sure of that. I accepted what she said and cast someone else. There was no way I was making any demand to Daria to terminate her pregnancy. I wanted her to be very clear that that was what she really wanted.\" He was \"upset and angry\", but \"then I moved on\". It's more on the theme of Derek Deane as the \"monster\", he tells us. \"I have been criticised so much since the Agony and the Ecstasy programme that it is water off a duck's back. I know what happened and that is enough for me.\" When next they meet it should be interesting. \u2022 More on Iain Duncan Smith's Universal Jobmatch website, because it does seem that the position advertised by \"I.D.S. Pest Control Services\" was actually bogus. Soon after we flagged it up on Monday, the ad just disappeared. An opportunity lost. Maybe IDS is going to do the job himself. \u2022 He might sensibly have involved himself a bit more from the outset, because it has been a bit of a fiasco. We hinted at this last year. We find that we didn't know the half of it. But we do now, thanks to a Freedom of Information request triggered by our report last December, which confirms that the first tendering process was botched and had to be run twice. \"Steria Ltd challenged the evaluation process informally by making a complaint to DWP [Department for Work and Pensions],\" officials admit. \"Methods consulting commenced a legal challenge after Monster Worldwide Limited's bid was announced as the winning bid.\" Steria's complaint was addressed by running the tender process the second time, but dealing with Methods wasn't as easy. \"A payment was made to Methods,\" the DWP admits. How much? The DWP won't tell, for it says the figure will be revealed in its annual report in July. Methods won't say either. But seems to have been enough to keep the whole debacle out of the public eye. \u2022 Finally, the world according to communities secretary Eric Pickles is a fascinating place, to say the least. Today we learned of his joy at the prospect of pesky hacks being put in their place by press regulation. Now his thoughts on the Chris Huhne-Vicky Pryce affair. \"With regard to the issue of marital coercion, my wife says, 'I have to tell you that it's been years since I listened to a word you said,'\" he told lobby hacks. Hurrah for Mrs Pickles. She sounds too good for him, quite frankly. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
