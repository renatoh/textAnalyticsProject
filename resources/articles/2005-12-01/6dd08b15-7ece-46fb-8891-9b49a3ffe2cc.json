You don't get people saying you can't go into this bar or that bar because you haven't got the right badge. One time, I was at a course with Robert [Alner, his trainer], and the man who sponsors the whole yard was there too, and we got told we couldn't go into the owners and trainers bar because I didn't have the right badge. I said to Robert, you wonder why I say 'bugger National Hunt racing'?\" But Sendell does have a horse of Kingscliff's calibre and so, for one more day at least, he will suffer the indignities of racing under Rules. Kingscliff, bought after a day's racing at Punchestown three years ago, has graduated from west country point-to-points to stand two races away from millionaire status. Victory at Sandown on Monday, where he takes on the Gold Cup winner Kicking King, and then at Cheltenham in March would earn a seven-figure bonus and make him the highest earner in National Hunt history. Even 15 years ago, racing's winter code was still pretty much a Corinthian pursuit in which the idea of a million-pound bonus would have seemed almost vulgar. Now, with jumping increasingly controlled by big-money owners with dozens of horses, Sendell, whose entire string rarely runs to more than four legs and a tail, could be the first person in the sport to bank a seven-figure cheque. The idea seems refreshing, like a homeopathic remedy for the immense wads of cash that have taken control of National Hunt. Sendell, though, is not about to be cast as a grassroots hero. \"I've had big money offers for Kingscliff almost from the start,\" he says. \"I agreed to sell him once, and then changed my mind. I'm coming up to 74, I've got no worries, no kids in school, and if you haven't made a bob or two to have fun with by the time you get to my age, well, you're not going to have a lot of chance afterwards, are you? \"But I don't want to be put up on any sort of pedestal, because if I'd been a younger man in different circumstances, he'd have gone, simple as that. In fact, he'd have gone as a five-year-old, because I got offered ridiculous money for him even then after he'd won his first two point-to-points. \"The only reason I didn't sell him was that Robert said he thought he could win the Foxhunters [at the Cheltenham Festival] for me, and he might even do it the next year. I took a gamble, and that's just what he did.\" Sendell, who spent his working life as an electrical engineer, is a man of Somerset and its countryside to the core. \"I think we probably go back to Domesday,\" he says. \"The first parish register they've got around here is from the 1500s, and there's Sendells in there.\" He used to race greyhounds too, including Westpark Mustard, who won 20 races in a row in 1974 to beat Mick The Miller's long-standing record, a mark that stood until Ballyregan Bob came along 10 years later. Like Kingscliff, Sendell is a regular with his local hunt. \"A lot of people wouldn't take a horse like that out hunting, and certainly not a week before a big race like the King George, but he absolutely loves it, and it lights him up tremendously,\" the owner says. \"It's only on Robert's farm and Robert will ride him, so it's not like he doesn't know where he's going. It's like having a kid and taking him to a party, that's how much he enjoys it. \"Kingscliff is a very laid-back horse. A cat once jumped on to his back at the yard and then sat there cleaning its paws before it jumped off again, and he stood there like a police horse. You wouldn't get many racehorses doing that, so if he had had to just go up and down the gallops every day, he could get lazy and sulk.\" Sendell is a hands-on owner who had the final say in the choice of jockey for Kingscliff when Robert Walford, his partner at Haydock last month, was ruled out by injury. His decision to opt for Tony Dobbin in preference to Andrew Thornton, who famously won a race on Kingscliff at Ascot with a broken rein, was a surprise for many. \"Andrew didn't agree with me and he argued his corner but I said to him: 'I don't think the horse suits you, it's as simple as that.' I remember when Henrietta Knight didn't want Tony McCoy to ride Best Mate - no one was calling him a poor jockey. \"I'm not a big owner, so I like getting involved. I enjoy my horses, I buy them all myself, and sometimes I'm lucky and sometimes I'm not. My horse is really, really well, this is the first year we haven't had some silly little problem with him. I'm not saying that Kicking King won't come along and beat us, but I will say this: if he's going to, he'll have to improve a bit.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
