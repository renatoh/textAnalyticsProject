This episode's skilfully wrought interviews and archive footage revisit the vertiginous rise and fall of the 1980s. As traditional manufacturing and mining declined, there was a scramble for the offshore platforms (and the offices of the banks they were enriching), while the country became besotted with the delusions of perpetual wealth associated with any such boom. AM Private Practice 9pm, Living Naomi is still blanking Sam and Addison, Coop has a secret girlfriend and Pete is branching out into cellulite removal. As an afterthought, a couple of patients are thrown into the mix; a young couple with fertility issues and a terminal teen whose dad won't accept defeat. But most time is spent on the staff's shiny, sculpted faces, shooting each other a selection of looks that cover the spectrum from slight bafflement to mild lust. Occasionally a character appears to be leaking beneath the eyes, but those regular, symmetrical puddles of fluid were so applied with a dropper. JR That Mitchell and Webb Look 9.30pm, BBC2 Tonight's joyous patchwork of silliness includes a righteous meat-eater striking a blow against the vegetarians, a brief moment of clarity for Sir Digby Chicken Caesar's sidekick Ginger, and a glorious Bond parody set in a very English casino. Webb's dancing prowess even gets a brief outing in an Austen parody. There seem to be no limits to the scope of subjects M&amp;W tackle - unlike Little Britain, their targets are never predictable; it's just an ever-changing buffet of the unexpected. This is properly crafted funniness for people who like their jokes to contain words and ideas. Superb. JR Psychoville 10pm, BBC2 Like The League Of Gentlemen turned up past 11 - which is a good thing, by the way - Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton's grotesque blackmail comedy continues. Tonight, there's the revelation of a terrible secret from the past, which leads on to the discovery that toys can be \"commodities\" and that dwarf porn is issued under the Midget Gems moniker. God alone knows how it's all going to turn out, but the journey's the thing. JW"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
