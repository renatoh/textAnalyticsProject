At just 22, the Portland Timbers striker has already learned to dismiss that notion. \u201cThe idea of sticking to sports is unrealistic,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the same way it\u2019s tough to separate rap music from the experience that the rap music is describing. You can appreciate the music, but at what point can you appreciate the fact that a rapper\u2019s talking about poverty, talking about killings going on, talking about ambitions\u201d Ebobisse, who broke into the Portland Timbers\u2019 starting line-up last season, had already made a name for himself before finding success in Major League Soccer. The striker is known for his unapologetic presence on Twitter, where he speaks candidly about race, immigration, homelessness and a host of other topics. It\u2019s not the attitude one might expect from a kid who grew up in one of DC\u2019s wealthiest suburbs. \u201c\u2018Bubble\u2019 is a term that gets thrown out a lot, but there\u2019s no other way to describe Bethesda and Montgomery County,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing around comfortable financial situations allowed me to progress on my own track and not worry about a lot of things, but inevitably they all found their way into my life, at different moments.\u201d One such wake-up call came during his second and final year at Duke, when a noose was discovered hanging on campus. The school\u2019s investigation subsequently blamed the incident on ignorance rather than racism, but the damage was done. Coming as it did amidst a spate of headlines about racism on American campuses and police killings of black Americans, the incident set off a firestorm that taught Ebobisse about the people around him, and about himself. \u201cYou really found where people stood, from \u2018Oh, it\u2019s not that big of a deal. He didn\u2019t know what he was doing. It was an accident,\u2019 to the other side, which was like, \u2018This is unacceptable,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cYou find yourself in the middle of all that, trying to find your voice, and from there, I think I felt pretty comfortable with who I was, and speaking out.\u201d His platform grew when he left college to sign an MLS contract, a decision he did not take lightly. In addition to tweeting about criminal justice reform and speaking out against detention of migrants at the border \u2013 \u201cWhat\u2019s going on right now is shocking on a number of levels\u201d \u2013 Ebobisse unequivocally supports athletes who prioritize their professional careers over a college degree. \u201cThese guys do everything and bring in a lot of money, and the person selling their jersey at the campus bookstore can make money off of them, the coaches can make millions of dollars, tens of thousands off camps, they can sign autographs and get their own individual endorsement deals, and a player can\u2019t do anything, and they\u2019re actually the ones putting it out there?\u201d he asks. Ebobisse\u2019s experiences in high school and at Duke shaped his views on education, racial justice and the connections between the two. As a boy, he says, he took offense when people chalked his accomplishments up to affirmative action. As he matured, he started to articulate his response. \u201cWe talk about reparations in this country \u2013 because that\u2019s been a hot topic recently \u2013 I think affirmative action is the bare minimum, when you think about it, because it\u2019s giving us an opportunity to get into these elite institutions that have for so long barred the door,\u201d he argues. \u201cNow, we can say that Brown v Board of Education allowed everything to be equal, took the shackles off, but if you give one group that much of a head start, it\u2019s unrealistic to say, \u2018OK, everything\u2019s equal, now catch up.\u2019\u201d Ebobisee remembers driving on a highway named after Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, as a child. He believes education policy needs to address the racial history many Americans don\u2019t know, or prefer to ignore. \u201cI was having an argument about the Civil War with one of my friends who went to school in Texas. He was telling me that the Civil War had little or nothing to do with slavery, and l was lost on that point,\u201d Ebobisse said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t even have the same fundamental, basic education where we\u2019re learning the same things, how can we have arguments about larger policies?\u201d Education reform, he believes, should start \u201con a very fundamental level, with how education\u2019s funded.\u201d His school in Bethesda was excellent, he says, because American schools are funded by local property taxes. In neighboring counties with lower property values, children didn\u2019t get the same opportunities he enjoyed. Unsurprisingly, when asked about his role models, Ebobisse immediately names LeBron James. In addition to James\u2019s own interest in education, Ebobisse admires his ability to control his own narrative and refusal to change his personality in response to criticism. In that respect, the young striker emulates James. Plenty of people have warned him to tone down the political talk, he says, but \u201cthere was nothing they could do to change it.\u201d He adds that he\u2019s \u201cnever gotten even an ounce of criticism\u201d from anyone in the Timbers organization. Ebobisse has started the 2019 season well, scoring four goals in 13 appearances. In January, he received his first senior international cap, starting for the United States against Panama. \u201cI can\u2019t overstate how important that was to me,\u201d he says of his national team call-up. Does playing for the USMNT mean he can\u2019t criticize the US? \u201cRight now, I\u2019m more critical because of who\u2019s in office and what he\u2019s doing. I don\u2019t see myself as representing him at all,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, him aside, I\u2019m critical of government because I believe in its ability for good. I believe in big government. I think big government can help protect a lot of things that are important, from a social to economic aspect, where an individual might be taken advantage of.\u201d Just three years into his career, Ebobisse says he\u2019s \u201cconstantly thinking about\u201d ways to use his platform to promote social change, with an eye toward the work he will do when his playing days are over. He also hopes more of his fellow soccer players find their voices as he continues to develop his. \u201cIt\u2019d be cool to see more soccer players speaking out more,\u201d he said. \u201cTwitter\u2019s like a microphone, and hopefully that microphone reaches more and more people, but I want to do something more off the field, off the screen, something that\u2019s gonna have a wider impact.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
