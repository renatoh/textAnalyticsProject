The insurer asked revenue and customs to clarify the status of a new tax that some of its customers might have had to pay. It feared the 1 million policyholders who will receive their share windfalls into personal pension plans might have incurred tax bills at 40% as a result of rule changes being implemented in April. The possibility has been averted after negotiations with revenue and customers and means the shares will be received tax free."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
