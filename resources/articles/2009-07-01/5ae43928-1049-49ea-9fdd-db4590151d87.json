Free rainwater for the garden. Marvellous. But only for a day or so, because soon a nasty scum formed on top of the water and it started to stink \u2013 first like fermenting fruit, then like sick. What was it? A dead rat in the gutter? The dripping lime trees? The sun glaring on the butt? Nobody knew, so I watered my beautifully scented plants and the whole garden smelled of vomit. My few square yards of paradise were ruined. And what if I watered my vegetables with this swill? Would I poison myself? So during the heatwave I had to use the hose anyway. Someone rang, I dropped the hose into the pond, ran to answer the phone, forgot the hose, had my dinner, went out a couple of hours later to pick raspberries, and waded into a flood plain. Ten thousand baths had been poured away, the pond overflowed, the lilies drowned, baby frog-tadpoles swept into the flowerbeds. Tragedy. And I was being so careful: having one bath a week to save water, schlepping the bathwater downstairs to the garden, pulling the chains only when things got serious, and for what? One little senior moment and it's all for nothing. It will take a lifetime of no baths at all to recoup my loss. This is why I hesitated before requesting a water meter. I knew this sort of slip-up was on the cards. Losing one's mind can be frightfully costly. Like a good girl I bought my parking permit weeks in advance. Then I forgot to display it. I leave the computer on all night, hot\u2013water and chargers on forever. I park the car, the dog spots a squirrel, someone says hello, or I'm distracted by some charming foliage. So I forget the parking ticket \u2013 goodbye \u00a350. I can appeal, of course. Imagine my defence. \"I'm sorry, I forgot.\" And we are all getting older and more forgetful. Lucky utilities, councils and clampers. There's always a silver lining. For someone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
