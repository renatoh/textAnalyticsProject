Eighty-three years on, her grandson, Thomas Harding, along with members of the local community, reopened it to the public on Sunday after a painstaking restoration process in which the house by the lake \u2013 the subject of his bestselling 2015 book of the same name \u2013 was saved from demolition and turned into a educational meeting place for young Europeans. \u201cMy family was initially very anxious and angry about my idea to save the house,\u201d Harding explained. \u201cIt was associated with the profound trauma the family had experienced having to flee their homeland. Family members said, \u2018why should we help restore something the Germans stole from us?\u2019 But six years on they are completely behind the project and I think Elsie would be delighted.\u201d Harding\u2019s book captures how the house in Gro\u00df Glienicke, a village 14km (nine miles) west of central Berlin, encompasses a very German story \u2013 spanning the last years of imperial Germany, the Weimar Republic, the Third Reich and communist rule. Built in 1928 by Elsie\u2019s father and Harding\u2019s great-grandfather, Alfred Alexander \u2013 a prominent Berlin doctor whose patients included Albert Einstein and Marlene Dietrich \u2013 who sought a retreat from hectic Berlin life, the family were forced to abandon it six years later after Adolf Hitler came to power, because they were Jewish. The Nazi state, its new owners, rented it to the music publisher Will Meisel and his film star wife Eliza Illiard, before his manager and his Jewish wife used it as a hiding place. During the cold war it was severed from its lakeside location with the erection of the Berlin Wall, the iron curtain literally slicing a menacing barrier along the bottom of the garden. Among its residents was a communist border guard and Stasi informer. Representatives of all five families who lived there were present at the opening party also attended by villagers and local dignitaries who have lent the project their support. Harding visited the house with Elsie in 1993, four years after the collapse of communism, when she regaled the residents with stories of her family\u2019s summers. She furnished her grandson with anecdotes such as how Einstein had been among the intellectuals to visit, arriving in his slippers and discussing detective novels with her father. Harding set about saving it from demolition in 2013 after hearing from a local that it had fallen into such a state of disrepair it was threatened with demolition amid plans to build new homes on the site. \u201cWhen we found it it had been uninhabited for 10 years, and was being used as a drug den, with gaping holes in the roof,\u201d Harding recalls. Posters of western rock bands had been pasted over the wood panelling by one of its residents during communism. He organised a clean-up day with family members and locals, \u201cand soon even the most sceptical members of my family were won over\u201d. So too were authorities who said if he could prove it was of historic value then it would warrant preservation. Architects, restorers and a dedicated team of locals over four years and at a cost of more than \u20ac300,000 (\u00a3268,000) in donations and state support, have returned the Alexander Haus, as it is to be known, to the quaint and colourful wooden retreat described by Elsie in a letter as the \u201cfoundation of the family\u2019s good fortune\u201d. Designed by Otto Lenz in the Bauhaus style, the house\u2019s striking cobalt blue and white windows emblazoned with large diamond shape shutters, against its dark-stained wooden exterior, as well as a strikingly colourfully interior of tongue and groove pine walls in oranges, reds greens and blues, have been reinstated. It has been given a Denkmal \u2013 or listed \u2013 status, enabling the family to receive some state support towards the restoration. The rest of the money has been raised by private donors in Germany and the UK. The family was able to escape Nazi Germany in 1936, after Elsie\u2019s sister, Bella, married a British man \u2013 who later died as an RAF pilot in 1945 \u2013 whom she had met and fallen in love with at the summer house. When Alfred Alexander was in London visiting Bella\u2019s first child, Peter Sussmann, who was born in December 1934, his family in Germany got wind of the fact that he was due to be seized by the Nazis and warned him not to return. The rest of the family was able to follow him to the UK thanks to Bella\u2019s status as a British citizen. They sought refuge in Britain and eventually settled there. Now 84, Peter Sussmann looked proudly on on Sunday as family members cut a red ribbon across the front door to cries of \u2018mazel tov\u2019, accompanied by a rabbinical blessing. \u201cMy mother talked about this place frequently,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very important to her. We once came back together in the early 70s, but could only view it with binoculars from the West German side of the lake shore when the wall was up. She showed me the house, the vague outline of which we could just about see through the trees.\u201d On Friday night, the family broke bread under the eaves of the house \u201cfor the first time in over eight decades\u201d, he said. \u201cThen it came home to me \u2013 having at first belonged to the sceptical wing of the family \u2013 just how important it is as a sign of reconciliation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
