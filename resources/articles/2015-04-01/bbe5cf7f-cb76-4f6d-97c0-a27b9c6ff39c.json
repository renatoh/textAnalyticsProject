With a five-man defence supported when Liverpool had the ball by at least three others \u2013 often N\u2019Doye was the only man ahead of the ball as they battled to regain possession \u2013 they formed a formidable barrier, but at the expense of ceding possession and limiting their offensive options. It is hard to be critical in the context of a precious victory, but their opportunities were few and had one of Liverpool\u2019s late thrusts come to fruition they would surely have regretted their failure to subject the visitors\u2019 defence to greater examination. 2) Another bad night for Balotelli Sone Aluko was the outstanding forward in this game, happy to carry the ball past opponents, running the channels, creating chances. Mario Balotelli meanwhile continues to inflict misery on all those who support his side: just one touch in the Hull penalty area (a ludicrously optimistic backheeled shot), and only one touch of any sort in the 20 second-half minutes he was on the field. As if his attacking fecklessness wasn\u2019t enough, as a bonus he was involved in Hull\u2019s goal, lazily lumbering forward after a corner while his team-mates sprinted, and playing Michael Dawson onside in the process. Had he swapped sides it would have massively weakened Hull\u2019s chances. 3) Can second best in fight for the right It is not just in attack that Liverpool\u2019s lack of effective options has been exposed this season. With Alberto Moreno injured and Jos\u00e9 Enrique not fully fit Glen Johnson filled in at left-back, with Emre Can on the right for most of the game. The German looked uncomfortable from the start, with Robbie Brady bursting past him with ease in the 27th minute before whipping in a cross-shot which Simon Migonolet pushed onto the head of Jake Livermore, whose effort was saved. It was one of several Hull raids down that flank, where Stephen Quinn offered Brady support \u2013 another bringing the corner from which Hull scored. It was ironic that he was exposed by Brady, another player shoehorned into a full\u2011back role (and whose left-footed set-piece delivery was also excellent) but perhaps Johnson might have moved to the right once it became clear this was where Hull\u2019s greatest threat lay. 4) Coutinho the brightest spark for Reds It was a poor performance but there was some encouragement for Liverpool. Philippe Coutinho once again stood out, not so much a light in his side\u2019s darkness as a blazing bonfire. The Brazilian was at the heart of Liverpool\u2019s best moments, whether coming deep to collect the ball, threatening down the left or skimming across the edge of the area, even if his ability to pick a pass through a defence is wasted when his striker is as immobile as Balotelli. The centre-backs were also impressive, with Dejan Lovren, until his injury, and Martin Skrtel dominant in the air and timing their challenges well, most noticeably when the Slovak snuffed out a two-on-two break by dispossessing Aluko. 5) Harper the hero despite spillages Hull recently dropped the goalkeeper Allan McGregor for a string of costly errors, including goals after he spilled shots against West Ham and Swansea. His replacement, 40-year-old Steve Harper, has now kept clean sheets in consecutive victories, but he is far from immune to potentially spillages of his own. Several times he failed either to hold on to shots or to shovel them clear of danger. Jordan Henderson saw efforts bounce off the keeper in each half but Liverpool\u2019s forwards did not close him down in search of scraps. Harper left the field a hero despite repeating the kind of errors that saw his colleague criticised."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
