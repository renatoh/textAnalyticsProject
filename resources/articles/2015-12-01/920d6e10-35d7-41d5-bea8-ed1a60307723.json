This predates Simon Rattle, and the deficiencies of both the Festival Hall and the Barbican have been acknowledged by many leading musicians. One need not travel to Berlin, Paris, Tokyo or Boston to be aware of what a good hall sounds like. We lived in the West Midlands through the Rattle years. It is not an exaggeration to say that the whole bustling Broad Street area of Birmingham was transformed by the building of the conference centre and Symphony Hall. Georg Solti was so impressed on his first visit to the hall that he booked more dates on the spot. Birmingham rarely had top international ensembles visit before. Mark Hebert St Ives, Cambridgeshire \u2022 Let\u2019s have a new concert hall for London costed, pro bono, and then distribute the estimated sum for musical education in schools worldwide. Rattle et al want there to be audiences for the future, don\u2019t they? Or are they all too interested in having others\u2019 money spent on new temples in which to display their own magnificence?
