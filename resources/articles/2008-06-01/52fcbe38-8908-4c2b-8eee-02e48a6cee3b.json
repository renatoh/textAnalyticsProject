It is easy to forget just how little dance could be seen outside London 50 years ago; change only began when Elizabeth West and Peter Darrell founded Western Theatre Ballet (WTB) in Bristol in 1957. Meyer was an early member of that company, and his experiences there inspired him to found Northern Dance Theatre (NDT) in Manchester. It is now called Northern Ballet and is based in Leeds; next year it will celebrate its 40th birthday. He was born in Guelph, in the Canadian province of Ontario. He rejected university to pursue ballet training in Toronto with Boris Volkov, before coming to Britain in 1956 to study at Sadler's Wells ballet school. He greatly admired Elizabeth West, who invited him to join WTB soon after it was formed, as a dancer (he took one of the principal roles in the notorious WTB ballet Mods and Rockers). West died in 1962, and the following year Meyer was appointed balletmaster, then associate artistic director in 1966. In 1968, Meyer won support from the Arts Council to explore the possibility of starting a new company in Manchester. The omens were good, and when WTB settled in Scotland in 1969, he left to found NDT, which became England's only regional dance company. Formed with just 10 dancers, the company gave its first performance on November 28 1969. It offered triple bills, with a mix of classical and modern works. Several of these were rarely performed early dance classics, such as Death and the Maiden by Andr\u00e9e Howard, and The Green Table (its first performance in Britain) and The Big City, both by Kurt Jooss. Meyer revived works originally performed by WTB and created new works of his own, besides encouraging members of the company to do the same. One dancer, Jonathan Thorpe, proved to be an especially talented choreographer, creating Tancredi and Clorinda, Quartet, and A Woman's Love, the last danced by Ursula Hageli and Simon Mottram, to Schumann's song cycle, Frauenliebe und Leben, beautifully sung by Alfreda Hodgson. Meyer was creating longer ballets in a classical style to meet the demands of the board and local audiences: Schubert Variations, then Cinderella and Aladdin, the last two both full-length productions. The reorganisation of local government in the early 1970s was an anxious but hopeful period. Meyer and his administrator, Freda Steel, negotiated funding from the new Greater Manchester council. As the council's arts adviser, and having seen all NDT's productions, I was happy to attend board meetings as their observer. The councillors were uncomfortable about supporting ballet, and they demanded glowing reviews, which were not always forthcoming. By 1975, after several years of directing, training, creating new work and negotiating, Meyer was tired. He was a quietly spoken man and not the kind of personality to thrive in the macho world of north-west politics. Tensions arose, and it was suspected that he was not the leader to take the company into the new, grander phase that was desired by the board. Simon Townley, as chairman, took a tough line (I was at the meeting), and Meyer was more or less forced to resign there and then. It was brutal, undignified and unappreciative of what he had achieved in a short time; it came as an enormous shock to him. It is very much to his credit, and consistent with his character, that he stayed on good terms with members of the company afterwards. Meyer went to Israel for two or three years to restore his confidence and to work there with the Bat Dor and the Kibbutz contemporary dance companies. On his return to England he became director of the Legat school at Wadhurst college in Sussex, then senior lecturer at the Laban centre in London, establishing the Laban's classical ballet syllabus. He retired in 2006. In his leisure time, Meyer enjoyed working on his allotment, visiting antique markets and joining in the activities of the Barnes community association. He was an intelligent, modest and self-contained man, who enjoyed lifelong friendships. Having lost contact with his family in Canada, towards the end of his life he rediscovered a brother, who survives him. He had an affectionate adopted father-daughter relationship with Ursula Hageli, who is his executor. \u00b7 Laverne Meyer, dancer, choreographer, teacher and artistic director, born February 1 1935; died April 25 2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
