Ahead of a meeting of Nationals MPs on Monday morning, Williams, a New South Wales Nationals senator, told the ABC he wasn\u2019t sure if Joyce had \u201cdone anything wrong by the law of the taxpayers\u201d. \u201cHopefully he hasn\u2019t breached any regulations in terms of travel allowances and spending of the public purse,\u201d he said. Williams said Joyce had previously told the ABC there were no problems, so \u201clet\u2019s hope it is the situation, and see what pans out\u201d. \u201cMy job is to keep my nose clean and look after my staff. I can\u2019t answer for other people. Let\u2019s see how the travel thing comes out,\u201d he said. When asked directly if Joyce would still be leading the Nationals at the next election, Williams said he could not answer that for sure. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s done anything wrong by the law of the taxpayers. I can\u2019t judge on that. How do I form an opinion when I don\u2019t know. That is just speculation.\u201d Pressure has mounted on Joyce over the weekend following confirmation last week that his 24-year marriage had ended, and he was expecting a child with his new partner and former staffer, Vikki Campion. There has been a focus on taxpayer-funded travel and on Campion\u2019s movements in government staff positions once she left Joyce\u2019s office. Labor has signalled over the weekend that it intends to investigate Joyce\u2019s expenditure of taxpayer funds. Campion was first moved to the office of then resources minister Matt Canavan, but once he moved to the backbench after becoming embroiled in the dual citizenship controversy, she was employed in the office of Nationals whip, Damian Drum. As the Daily Telegraph first reported over the weekend, Drum\u2019s staffing allocation was increased from six to seven to accommodate Campion. Campion was understood to have moved to Drum\u2019s office on her six-figure salary as a senior advisor. Campion\u2019s contract ended in December last year. An assessment of staffing allocations, tabled for Senate estimates over the last three years, shows the Nationals whip does not usually receive an allocation for a senior advisor. Of the four electorate officers, plus one or two personal staff allocations, the maximum level has traditionally been that of advisor. The highest position allocated to the chief government whip, a more senior position than that of the Nationals whip, is also advisor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
