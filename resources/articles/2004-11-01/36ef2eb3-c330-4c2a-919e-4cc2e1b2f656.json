It was the first major policy announced by Washington after the re-election of George Bush. There was jubilation in Macedonia, a US ally in Iraq, but anger in Greece, which is a Nato member, where the news came out of the blue. The EU also did not appear to have been informed in advance. Mr Crvenkovski confirmed the move on national television. \"Today is a great day for Macedonia and all Macedonians wherever they are,\" he said. In Athens, the Greek foreign minister, Petros Molyviatis, protested to the US ambassador about the \"unilateral decision\" which he said would have \"many negative effects\". Greece has opposed the name ever since Macedonia, a neighbour, won independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. Until now it had the support of all Nato allies, except Turkey, for refusing recognition. They refer to it in all documents as FYROM, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
