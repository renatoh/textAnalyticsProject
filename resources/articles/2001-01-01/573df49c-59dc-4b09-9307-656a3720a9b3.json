Such was the animosity between the European and world governing bodies that talk of a split between the two was being regarded as a real possibility. Uefa officials were incensed by what they feel is Fifa's high-handed approach to negotiations with the EC. They were astonished when they found out on Thursday that Fifa had effectively ended co-operation over negotiations with the EC. Fifa had sent an official negotiation document to Brussels outlining its latest proposals on how the transfer system can be amended to comply with the Treaty of Rome without informing or consulting Uefa. In a heated meeting yesterday Uefa officials demanded that Fifa withdraw the document and is asking that Fifa notify the EC that it is not official policy and that in future it will consult Uefa over all aspects of the transfer system. Fifa's plan is understood to make radical proposals that give players greater freedom to walk out on contracts and a system of compensation that could see clubs receive considerably less for players whom they nurture and then move on. There is also disagreement on a proposal to ban transfers on players aged under 18, which is supported by Uefa but opposed by Fifa and the EC. This is a direct contradiction of Uefa's position, which insists that both players and clubs need greater stability and that clubs should also be rewarded for footballers who leave. Until Fifa decided to dispense with a joint negotiating position, Uefa had been making real progress in having this view adopted as football's position in talks with the EC. There was growing unrest within Uefa at Fifa's actions yesterday. Gerhard Aigner, Uefa's chief executive who has been in charge of negotiations over transfers, made his anger plain in telephone conversations with heads of European leagues. He spoke with officials from England, Italy, Spain and German, the four most powerful and richest leagues in Europe, and aired the thought that Uefa might be forced into a breakaway from the world governing body. Despite having worked on the transfer issue together for some months, Fifa and Uefa remain polarised. Uefa, for example, is proposing a minimum three- to five-year period of contract which players must honour. Under Fifa's latest proposal players would be able to walk out on a contract following a specified period of notice, perhaps three months. Fifa agrees with the EC that players cannot be put in a position where they cannot walk out on clubs but clubs can sell them. Plans to amend the transfer system first came under the spotlight last year when it emerged that Fifa was not planning to oppose any of the changes demanded by the EC, first issued 18 months ago. Uefa officials reacted angrily, claiming that abolishing the transfer system could spell the end of the game and kill small clubs. A joint Uefa/Fifa working party on the issue was formed but effectively fell apart this week. Uefa officials privately maintain that, given European football's powerful economic position and global popularity, it would be able to split from Fifa, although such a move would be considered only when every other option had been exhausted. Mike Lee, Uefa director of communications, said: \"We are disappointed that a new set of proposals were submitted to the EC without consultation with European football.\" Fifa and Uefa are due to meet early next week to see if they can once again thrash out a compromise and formulate a united repose to the EC's demand for a reformed football transfer system. This latest battle is being played out against the backdrop of an increasingly annoyed EC and increasingly frustrated football clubs who are not feeling confident about negotiating big money deals while the system is under discussion. The EC, which has promised a resolution of the whole affair by the end of January, is upset by football's inability to formulate a solution and primarily blames Europe. Christophe Forax, spokesman for EC sports commissioner Viviane Reding, who is spearheading attempts to change the transfer system said: \"We are currently looking at Fifa's new proposals and will discuss them next week. In recent weeks we have had the impression that Uefa does not want to find a solution. I hope that over the next few days the football family will be able to sit down and resolve its differences.\" If it does not, the consequences for the game could be huge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
