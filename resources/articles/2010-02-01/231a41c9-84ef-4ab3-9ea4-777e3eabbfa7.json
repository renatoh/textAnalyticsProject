A more appropriate moniker might be Billy Perpetual Adolescent for a man who seems stuck in the depressions and self-pity of his teenage years. A placard on which he's written a kind of manifesto for Childishness paints a picture of a genuinely miserable existence, a scenario for the devil's sitcom. And yet his music, playing nearby, is likable stuff, and so are the record sleeves telling of a career in punk that began in 1977. These engaging ephemera are confined to the upstairs gallery at the ICA, set up as a sort of Billy Childish archive. Downstairs are his new paintings, on which this well-earned exhibition by such a veteran cult figure will be judged. Childish is a much better painter than Damien Hirst, but that's like saying a live dog catches a stick faster than a dead dog. Perhaps more to the point is that his paintings have something in common with those of his former girlfriend Tracey Emin: both are addicted to the expressionist fjords of Edvard Munch, while being mired in the shorescapes of south-east England. Childish seems to me a mirror image of Emin, if she had a sex change and gave up conceptual art. There's the same scratchy insistence on me, me, me that is at once maddening and heroic. Childish is no Munch, but these paintings of isolated figures and coastal dreck have the guts to be totally joyless and maudlin, and might well have come out of a 1950s art school. This cussed quality makes for an interesting exhibition \u2013 and I trust Billy Childish to go on irritating the skin of modern Britain for some time to come. Until 18 April.
