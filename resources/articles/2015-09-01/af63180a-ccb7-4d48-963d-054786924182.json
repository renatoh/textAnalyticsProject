Rather, it is a fact of a person\u2019s life that affects everything, not least their ability to work. Despite the government\u2019s boast that the Work Programme is helping many long-term unemployed into work (and even there one might question what kind of work), charities say that the scheme continues to let down physically and mentally disabled people, not finding them employment and failing to understand their particular difficulties in embarking on job hunting and navigating the workplace. Does this surprise anyone? It seems clear to me that the system is stacked against disabled people. Some might point out that such back-to-work schemes are supposed to be voluntary for disabled people. However, increasingly, it would appear that there is good voluntary and bad voluntary. The bad type of voluntary being the kind that can be forced upon people if their disabled status is queried or refuted (the system is awash with cases of people claiming they\u2019ve been wrongly and unfairly assessed). Lest we forget, for a significant number of disabled people even the basics of employment are intimidating \u2013 from actually getting to work and having enough energy for a working day, to adjusting to the workplace as a long-term unemployed disabled person and fitting in any health appointments they may need. Even the job search can be daunting. Job hunting is becoming more complex and punishing for everyone, with disastrous benefits penalties for those who fail to keep pace. By all accounts, job hunting circa 2015 is an exhausting, relentless, soul-sapping crapshoot \u2013 even healthy people need computers, transport and endless stamina for interviews and filling out questionnaires. How are disabled people supposed to keep up? Short answer: without sustained, focused, properly managed and funded support, they can\u2019t. Recently, Iain Duncan Smith mused on his department\u2019s pathetic record in this area and deduced that, rather than it being his own failing, it must be the fault of vast swaths of diabolically prejudiced anti-disability employers \u2013 presumably twirling their evil moustaches. Does he think that we\u2019re all idiots? While obviously this is true of some employers, it would be a bit of a stretch to claim that it fully explains the astounding failure rate. Duncan Smith also pondered on the fact that the employment and support allowance (ESA) assesses disabled people as either fit or unfit to work. \u201cThings are rarely that simplistic,\u201d he concluded. Well, \u201csimplistic\u201d ain\u2019t good \u2013 then again, this fit/unfit business could make a soul feel uneasy. Excuse my suspicious mind, but it\u2019s almost as though Duncan Smith is plotting to introduce a sliding scale whereupon even more disabled people are magically \u201creassessed\u201d as fit to work. Perhaps it\u2019s time to readdress some facts that keep getting mysteriously lost in the Tory mix. First, a sizable number of disabled people are genuinely unable to work, through no fault of their own \u2013 it would seem to be a marker of a civilised society to stop hounding them with ongoing demands for proof when their circumstances have remained unchanged. And of those people who could work, many require sustained assistance in both sourcing and maintaining long-term employment \u2013 the same help that charities are saying is not forthcoming. Without this support, trying to force disabled people into work looks about as logical as chucking a pair of damp trainers at them and suggesting they enter the London Marathon. No one wants to stop disabled people working, to patronise or stereotype them, or condemn them to a life in the shadows. However, helping disabled people back into employment should be just about that \u2013 helping them. Instead, we\u2019re left with a flimsy cover for herding and bullying highly vulnerable people out of the benefits system. This is America. We don\u2019t do free speech, Emily Poor Emily Blunt. The actress made a joke about watching a Republican debate and wondering whether she\u2019d done the right thing in becoming a US citizen (Blunt is married to American actor John Krasinski, and they have a child), and there was uproar, with one television presenter ordering her to leave America. Blunt has since apologised, but she shouldn\u2019t have to. The reaction was so out of proportion you\u2019d have thought that she\u2019d taken the American flag and burnt it live on-air, complete with a Hanoi Jane air-punch. Even had Blunt meant it seriously (she didn\u2019t), in a free country such as America, citizenship doesn\u2019t mean blind unquestioning allegiance to everything and everyone American on pain of expulsion. It means that an individual is now a citizen and thus entitled to, say, feel slightly aghast by a Republican debate, and express this with a vague half-witticism. In this context, Blunt being told to go home is puzzling. She\u2019s already home. Evidently, she felt so at home that she was able to crack a political joke. If she\u2019d chosen to go for citizenship in North Korea all this might make a bit more sense. Roadkill pie? It\u2019s ethical eating There\u2019s been a Middle England rumpus at The Great British Bake Off. Contestant Ian Cumming presented a dish he\u2019d named Roadkill Pie, saying he\u2019d first been inspired to use \u201cfound meat\u201d by a hare he\u2019d discovered by the side of the road. As his pie contained guinea fowl, venison, sausage, streaky bacon, and partridge, some people started wondering where Cumming was doing his motoring \u2013 my guess would be Selfridge\u2019s food hall. Others were scandalised by the very idea of eating roadkill, but I don\u2019t see why. Food safety issues aside, there\u2019s a compelling argument for it being the ethical thing to do. Why are people shocked at the thought of eating creatures that have been killed by vehicles, but remain serene about the ongoing horrors of sections of the organised commercial food industry? If I were an animal I\u2019d take being randomly bumped off by a car over the machinations of an abattoir any day. In fact, eating an animal which has been killed naturally in this way is probably about as close to \u201cvegan\u201d as a meat-eater could get. Cumming then blew any chance of animal rights kudos by announcing that he tests how dangerous his roadkill morsels are by feeding bits to his cat first, as if the feline in question were some kind of ersatz royal taster, prepared to throw down one of its nine lives on behalf of its human master. Not many animal lovers, even the non-vegetarian ones, would appreciate the idea of a pet copping it from ingesting toxic roadkill. Thanks to Bake Off for what could be viewed as yet another smudged, cracked window on the confused attitudes to animal welfare in Britain today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
