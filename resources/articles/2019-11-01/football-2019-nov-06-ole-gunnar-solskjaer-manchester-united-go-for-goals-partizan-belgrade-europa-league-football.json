Though his side opened their league campaign with an impressive 4-0 demolition of Chelsea, the six home matches since have featured a single goal in each and Solskj\u00e6r believes United can do better. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few results go against us through fine margins this season but now we know we are on the right track,\u201d the United manager said. \u201cThe defeat at Bournemouth put an end to that mini-run we were on but we can start another one against Partizan if things go well. \u201cWe have kept three cleans sheets already in the competition, which is impressive, and now we would like to score a few more goals. If we get off to a good start in a game like this we could fill our boots, and we want to go for it.\u201d United beat Partizan in Belgrade a fortnight ago and would qualify for the knockout stages with two games to spare by winning again in the return fixture. Victor Lindel\u00f6f will miss the game with a back injury, sustained against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup and exacerbated at Bournemouth, and Solskj\u00e6r does not expect to see Paul Pogba in action again until the beginning of December. The midfielder still has a cast on an ankle injury, though his manager feels he should be ready to start training again soon after the next international break. If United do qualify early, Solskj\u00e6r intends to continue with his policy of picking young players and reserves for the remaining games against Astana and AZ Alkmaar. \u201cOne of the best things about this competition is the opportunity it allows you to give young players a chance to come through,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a distraction from the league programme at all. We have given quite a few of our young lads the chance to play and they have all acquitted themselves very well.\u201d That policy may change in the knockout stages next year, especially if United find there is too much ground to make up in the league. United won the Europa League under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in 2017 and with the club currently 10th in the Premier League the competition could once again be their most realistic route to Champions League participation. \u201cIt\u2019s one route into the Champions League,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cWe are not about to give up on the other one at the beginning of November. It is still too early for anyone to predict the final league table. At the moment we don\u2019t have as many points as we would like but things can change very quickly.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r believes the return of Anthony Martial has made a difference and hopes to have more of his more experienced players back from injury after the international break. \u201cAnthony is a vital player for us, he\u2019s got different attributes to the rest of our attacking players,\u201d the manager said. \u201cHe holds the ball up well for us on the pitch, for example, but he\u2019s been missed in training as well. When he\u2019s in a good mood he really lifts the atmosphere.\u201d Ashley Young claims Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s enthusiasm is equally important in that regard. \u201cHe\u2019s very positive,\u201d said United\u2019s likely captain on Thursday. \u201cSometimes in training you feel he wants to put his boots on and join in. We like that, but we don\u2019t let him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
