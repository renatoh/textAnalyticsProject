He looks up and catches the eye of a girl nearby. They share a knowing glance. And that\u2019s the moment. It\u2019s a scene from a litany of TV shows and films. But, it\u2019s also the story of Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir\u2019s rebirth. And given the hopelessly romantic and cinematic dimension to their partnership, the story fits perfectly. \u201cWe were on a charity trip to Scotland [in 2015] and they were showing an Olympic video,\u201d Moir remembers. \u201cI looked over at Tessa. We kind of have our own language. And I was like, \u2018We\u2019re going to do one more Olympics, aren\u2019t we?\u2019 And she was like, \u2018Oh, yeah\u2019. I turned around to the bartender, ordered three more beers and just thought, \u2018Okay, here we go\u2019\u201d. At the time, the celebrated Canadian ice-dance duo were on a break. Embittered and irritated with skating, they\u2019d stepped away from competing and were mulling their next move. After a period of unprecedented success between 2010 and 2012, things shifted substantially prior to the Winter Olympics in Sochi. The entire experience, which culminated in a bitterly disappointing silver medal, was clouded by a simmering rift with coach Marina Zoueva and newspaper claims that the ice-dance result had been fixed by American and Russian judges. It was supposed to be Virtue and Moir\u2019s perfect swansong but instead they headed into presumed retirement full of anger, frustration and resentment. Moir, in particular, was disillusioned by all of it. \u201cI was just kind of sour with the sport,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anything to do with it. I went into a period of excessive partying and doing anything that wasn\u2019t figure skating, really. I went and built a house with my brother. I shut the whole world out and shut everything down.\u201d But the break \u2013 regardless of the emotions that came with it \u2013 was badly needed. \u201cGaining the perspective to reflect and reassess was paramount,\u201d Virtue says. After discussing a comeback in more detail, they earmarked former Canadian ice-dancers Marie-France Dubreuil and Patrice Lauzon as coaches and were eager to move to Montreal and get things started. But during their first conversation, Lauzon wanted them to explain their motivation for returning. It was a pre-requisite, he told them. \u201cThat floored us,\u201d Moir says. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get out of it by just saying, \u2018We want to win.\u2019 He just said, \u2018Well, that might not be enough. You need more than that if you want to come to our school.\u2019 It came down to the fact that we just felt we had more to give.\u201d In a new place and with a new coaching team, they were determined to push boundaries and rediscover the sport. \u201cWe weren\u2019t conforming to any one thing,\u201d Virtue says. \u201cWe lost this sense of trying to appease everyone else. We were more secure in who we were as people and athletes. We were more secure in what we stood for, what we valued and the art we wanted to create. I always loved skating but you can get hardened by it and it\u2019s discouraging and disheartening. You can lose that spark. Montreal ignited it again.\u201d In September 2016, they stepped into a rink in the Montreal borough of Pierrefonds and competed for the first time in two-and-a-half years at the Skate Canada Autumn Classic. The short dance was an electric, sensual tribute to Prince. Paired with the tenderness and contemporary slant of their free dance, it was a magnetic and thrilling package. Even so, it seemed a long shot that they would get the better of Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron, the French duo who were back-to-back world champions and unbeaten in two years. So, it was astonishing when Virtue and Moir ended the year on top of the Grand Prix podium for the first time in their careers and followed that up with a World Championship gold in 2017. \u201cI don\u2019t think people truly understand how difficult that is,\u201d Moir says. \u201cThree years is a long time. The game had evolved. And we\u2019re back in the arena, with the bright lights and everyone\u2019s faces looking back at us again. We did everything we could to prepare but there were a lot of tough steps. The goal was to not be our old selves. We knew we made a mistake in 2014. We didn\u2019t pick music that was dear to our hearts and weren\u2019t personally invested in a program. We vowed to never do that again.\u201d The new era was exciting but still left Virtue slightly underwhelmed. She was expecting something bigger, more explosive. \u201cI thought we\u2019d have this Ziggy Stardust moment,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018Representing Canada, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir\u2019 and the whole crowd would turn and gasp and say, \u2018Who? Who\u2019s that blonde girl? That\u2019s not Tessa.\u2019 I thought we would totally reinvent ourselves. But it was finding the balance. \u2018Are we doing things differently just to be different or to be better?\u2019 And that was a constant dialogue between us.\u201d For Moir, the entire process became a safe harbour as he navigated a particularly difficult period. \u201c2017 was probably one of the hardest years of my life,\u201d he admits. \u201cThere were a lot of personal struggles. I lost some very important people. I had a best friend and then a grandfather pass away. Through it all, skating became an anchor. I used to think of it as a job. Now it was getting me through and giving me hope. Through all the heartache, it seemed worth it. Heading into the Olympic season, we were ready for almost anything.\u201d In the build-up to Pyeongchang, they were consistently behind Papadakis and Cizeron, particularly in the free dance. So, they dramatically altered their sombre Moulin Rouge routine to make it more Olympic-friendly. \u201cWe changed about two minutes of our program entirely,\u201d Virtue says. \u201cWe listened to people for eight years telling us we needed a big ending, people on their feet and the music to reach this massive crescendo. That\u2019s the Olympic moment people want. Once we were able to find that, it soared and began to take shape.\u201d It worked. The subsequent free dance performance sits alongside Torvill and Dean\u2019s 1984 Bolero as the greatest ice-dance moment in history. Those four spellbinding minutes were not only enough to ensure astounding and unlikely Olympic golds for the pair but to also define Virtue and Moir\u2019s legacy. \u201cI had never felt momentum during a performance before,\u201d Virtue says. \u201cWe felt flow in Vancouver [when they won gold in 2010] and we chased that feeling for eight years. I went into the penultimate lift in Pyeongchang and I got chills because I felt the energy and electricity in the building shift.\u201d A different kind of momentum had been growing for a while too. Unlike their French rivals, Virtue and Moir took part in the team figure skating event a week earlier and quickly became viral sensations. In front of a global audience, the intensity of their chemistry, their innate closeness and the suggestiveness of certain choreography whipped new-found fans into a frenzy, especially across social media. When they found out Virtue and Moir were not involved in a romantic relationship, they didn\u2019t really accept it. Instead, they started to fantasize. There are dark corners of the digital sphere devoted to them, including some intense fan fiction. The disciples \u2013 and there are a lot of them \u2013 obsess over every look and every caress. \u201cIt\u2019s probably healthier to avoid it,\u201d Virtue says. But that\u2019s easier said than done. Last year, Moir spoke eloquently about the impact his unique athletic setup had on his personal life and how some partners found it difficult to properly understand his dynamic with Virtue. Before the Olympics, he was already daydreaming about what was on the other side. It\u2019s why he\u2019s so ready to move on to a new post-skating chapter and focus on things he spent so long sacrificing. \u201cI was ready for that transition,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was always skating first and I was finally at a point in my life where I could be a contributing member of my family and actually search for a life partner.\u201d Their relationship is a curious thing. When I ask Virtue to define it, she takes a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019re the worst at answering this question\u201d, she begins. \u201cI wish we could help ourselves and everyone else.\u201d She speaks uninterrupted for a few minutes. It\u2019s essentially a meandering run-on sentence. Then she apologizes profusely for not supplying the right answer. But, of course, she had done. It\u2019s why the moment of their eyes meeting in Scotland explains so much of their story. Words are limiting and what Virtue and Moir have goes far beyond that, almost existing in the abstract. \u201cWe were made for each other, in a work relationship,\u201d Moir says. \u201cThere\u2019s real love there. We\u2019re so proud of the business relationship we have. And that\u2019s the story we want to tell more than anything. Judging by my girlfriend\u2019s Twitter, I think fans are disappointed a little bit that we\u2019re not a couple but we have a very amazing, unique relationship that hopefully young people can look at and think, \u2018Wow, that should be inspirational in its own right\u2019\u201d. When they stood on the podium immediately after their Olympic victory, Virtue \u2013 normally so poised \u2013 uncharacteristically welled up. \u201cIt was seeing 20 years flash in front of me,\u201d she says. Her voice cracks so she nervously laughs to cover the lump in her throat. \u201cThe little seven and nine-year-old kids who got together, who didn\u2019t speak and who just skated around a rink holding hands. On the world\u2019s biggest stage, with all of that pressure, in that very moment ... I was just very proud of Scott. It\u2019s funny. We both have this thing where it\u2019s hard for us to acknowledge our own success but we\u2019re able to see it in each other.\u201d Currently, there\u2019s an adjustment period. It\u2019s not about the Olympics anymore. There are touring shows to produce and various other projects to plan for. They both admit that fully appreciating what they have and what they\u2019ve gone through together is something that will only come much later. For Moir, he\u2019s still struggling to wrap his head around the last year and a half. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it and I don\u2019t think I even have a proper perspective on it yet,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seems like it was a fairytale when I look back now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
