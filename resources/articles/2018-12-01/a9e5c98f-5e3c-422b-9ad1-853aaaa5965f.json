He left his note for the Democratic 42nd president on 20 January 1993. \u201cDear Bill,\u201d he began. \u201cWhen I walked into this office just now I felt the same sense of wonder and respect that I felt four years ago. I know you will feel that, too.\u201d Presidents traditionally leave such letters. But Bush\u2019s note to Clinton has taken on greater popular significance since January 2017 when Donald Trump, the 45th president, succeeded the 44th, Barack Obama. When the two met at the White House, they were stiffly formal. Obama\u2019s letter to Trump followed suit. In office, Trump has devoted himself to undoing Obama\u2019s legacy. In return, Obama has involved himself in the political fight to a greater extent than usual. \u201cI wish you great happiness here,\u201d Bush wrote in his letter to Clinton, with a warmth that might now seem as from another world. \u201cI never felt the loneliness some presidents have described. There will be very tough times, made even more difficult by criticism you may not think is fair. I\u2019m not a very good one to give advice; but just don\u2019t let the critics discourage you or push you off course. Underlining \u201cour\u201d, he added: \u201cYou will be our president when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well. Your success now is our country\u2019s success. I am rooting hard for you. \u201cGood Luck, George.\u201d Writing in the Washington Post, Bill Clinton said Bush\u2019s words showed \u201cnatural humanity\u201d. He added that while his friendship with Bush was at first \u201crespectful\u201d, it was after they became involved in relief efforts for the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 that the relationship blossomed. \u201cHis friendship has been one of the great gifts of my life,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI cherished every opportunity I had to learn and laugh with him.\u201d He added: \u201cGiven what politics looks like in America and around the world today, it\u2019s easy to sigh and say George HW Bush belonged to an era that is gone and never coming back \u2013 where our opponents are not our enemies, where we are open to different ideas and changing our minds, where facts matter and where our devotion to our children\u2019s future leads to honest compromise and shared progress. \u201cI know what he would say: \u2018Nonsense. It\u2019s your duty to get that America back.\u2019\u201d Clinton\u2019s wife lost the 2016 presidential election to Trump, who has constantly called for her to be imprisoned. In an Instagram post on Saturday, she said the letter reminded her of a gentler time. It made her cry when she first read it, Hillary Clinton wrote, and did so again when she heard Bush was dead. Obama was one of Bush\u2019s last visitors in Houston this week. Jimmy Carter, the 39th president, said in a statement Bush\u2019s presidency was \u201cmarked by grace, civility, and social conscience\u201d. Quoting James Baker, Bush\u2019s secretary of state, the New York Times reported that the 41st president\u2019s last words were spoken to the 43rd, his son George W Bush. \u201cI love you too,\u201d Bush Sr was quoted as saying."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
