In addition Durham's Paul Collingwood may miss the Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka in September because of a trapped nerve in his back. White, who made an unbeaten 94 in England's only innings of the drawn second Test at Trent Bridge, was in the process of re-establishing himself in the side and had been named in the squad for Sri Lanka. Now he is expected to be out of action for anything up to a month. With Andy Flintoff already suffering from a long-term groin niggle which will require rest, it means England may go into next week's Test without an all-rounder. Possible replacements for the limited-overs team would include the Surrey captain Adam Hollioake, who led the England one-day side four years ago and has played some scintillating cricket in the past few months, Rikki Clarke, another Surrey youngster, and Sussex's Robin Martin-Jenkins. The injuries are only the latest on a long list. Darren Gough is already out for the season, possibly longer, and Marcus Trescothick probably so. Andy Caddick has been absent for two months, James Foster has missed most of the summer because of a broken arm, and Alex Tudor and Simon Jones have suffered shin and side injuries respectively. Mark Butcher's knee, operated on earlier in the season, continues to give trouble, as do those of Dominic Cork and the Hampsire batsman John Crawley, who underwent a scan today which revealed no cartilage tear in his left knee so he may yet play in the today's championship match against Somerset. Cork's strained right knee means he will miss Derbyshire's match with Worcestershire, which ought to rule him out of the Test, although that may be offset by the return of Caddick and Tudor. It is not all gloom, however, because injuries to key bowlers have enabled England to blood the likes of Jones at Lord's and Steve Harmison at Trent Bridge. Neither let the side down, although Duncan Fletcher's assertion that Harmison rather than Matthew Hoggard was England's best bowler on the final day appeared no more than an attempt at morale-boosting. Both may yet have a part to play in Australia this winter. The batting has been the real mainstay of the side this summer. There could have been no greater advertisement for the improvement in technique - especially against spin - and the massive increase in confidence than the wonderful innings played by Michael Vaughan at Trent Bridge Then in recent times there have been, for example, Butcher's Headingley destruction of Australia last summer, grittymatch-winning skipper's knocks from Nasser Hussain, Flintoff's maiden Test century, and the establishment of Trescothick as a world-class opening batsman. He and Vaughan will provide a compelling counterpoint to the Australian pair Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer this winter. Now England are consistently posting totals that are intimidatory and not merely competitive. Four times in seven innings this summer they have topped 500 (600-plus in the last match) and once only 13 fewer. They have scored 3,316 runs in the five Tests so far, for the loss of 61 wickets, an average of 54.16 per wicket. A total of 10 centuries have been scored by seven different batsmen, as many as had been registered at home in 18 Tests over the previous three seasons. And they are scoring rapidly. Only four times in the past has England's scoring rate of 71 runs per 100 balls for their innings in the last Test been exceeded by them in an innings topping 450, and the top figure - 80.69 - was achieved in Christchurch barely five months ago. In part this can be put down to the quality of pitches that are being prepared, with outstanding offerings this summer at Lord's, Trent Bridge and Old Trafford, despite poor weather hindering preparation. Although it has to be acknowledged that the overall standard of opposition bowling has been modest, five England batsmen have averaged over 40 home and away in the past two years, the accepted benchmark for very good players. There is depth and consistency now as well as quality."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
