They could have had eight games to play with and failed to overtake the leaders, for during the past two months they have won once - at home to Sunderland, which barely counts. Now, after scoring against the run of play, they won again, their victory more comfortable than the margin suggests. Initially the match was dominated by West Ham. A mis-hit from Nigel Reo-Coker allowed Matthew Etherington to spear a shot across the face of the goal. Next a proper contact from Reo-Coker saw Hermann Hreidarsson clear off the line. It all seemed too easy for West Ham. 'We started terrific,' said Alan Pardew. Charlton, meanwhile, were as poor as Sunderland. And yet. Darren Bent broke down the right after 21 minutes and crossed perfectly for Shaun Bartlett to score his first of the season, from very close range. If Bartlett could score, anyone could. Charlton were invigorated. A minute later Dennis Rommedahl cut in from the right and Roy Carroll had to be at full stretch to turn wide. It was a brief spell. Etherington set up Shaun Newton, only for Thomas Myhre to save well. Marlon Harewood flashed a shot wide of the post. An Etherington effort was cleared off the line. Charlton rallied, though, and Bent might have given them a doubly undeserved lead at the end of a half packed with chances. The second half opened with Rommedahl, continuing to impress, creating a trio of chances for himself, the best of which hit the post. Charlton were dominant; West Ham dormant. \"We petered out, unfortunately,\" said Pardew. Bartlett and Bent fashioned a clever one-two, but lightning didn't strike twice. Then a cross from Chris Powell was met by Bent and headed confidently into the net for his tenth of the season. They might have had a third when a powerful header from Hreidarsson was saved one-handed by Carroll. Or when Bryan Hughes just failed to get on the end of a smart move involving Bent and Rommedahl. Victory took Charlton to within a point of West Ham with two games in hand. Mid-table security beckons. As for West Ham, if they continue to play as insipidly as they did in the second half, they might be about to embark on a run as dismal as Charlton's. \"I think we needed it,\" said Charlton manager Alan Curbishley. \"In the first half we looked very nervous, very edgy. But we got the goal on the break. Confidence is a big thing in football. This run we've had has been hard to take.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
