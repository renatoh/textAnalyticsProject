Writing in the Guardian, John Healey, the party\u2019s shadow defence secretary, described the bill as \u201cdishonest and damaging\u201d and said it was \u201cnot in the best interests of British troops, British justice or British military standing in the world\u201d. Labour sources indicated that the party would abandon its previous policy of abstaining should the amendments it was supporting fail, and oppose the bill at its third and final Commons reading. Critics argue the bill effectively legalises torture and war crimes by soldiers serving abroad because it introduces an effective five-year time limit to criminal prosecutions to almost all crimes for soldiers serving overseas. Healey wrote that he believed the government\u2019s approach \u201crisks the international criminal court acting to put British forces personnel on trial in the Hague if the UK justice system won\u2019t\u201d. Last month, three of Labour junior shadow ministers were sacked after joining Corbyn and 14 other MPs from the party in the division lobby by voting against, when the leadership had called for an abstention. It was the first of three human rights-related rebellions against the party leadership, including two others on the covert human intelligence sources bill, the last of which attracted 34 rebels, the largest rebellion since Keir Starmer took over as leader. Andrew Scattergood, the co-chair of the party pressure group Momentum, which had been campaigning on the bill, said Labour\u2019s leadership had \u201cdone the right thing\u201d but added: \u201cThey have only done so because of concerted pressure from Labour members and left MPs. This is a vindication of their principled opposition.\u201d Those on the left believe that Labour\u2019s tactic of repeated abstention had been designed to \u201cprovoke leftwing resignations\u201d \u2013 including the subsequent departures of Dan Carden and Margaret Greenwood at the most recent rebellion. The party faces a greater crisis following the suspension of Corbyn, who had said the scale of Labour\u2019s antisemitism problem \u201cwas also dramatically overstated for political reasons\u201d in the aftermath of a scathing EHRC investigation. Focus is expected to switch to amendments put down by the Conservative MP David Davis and Labour\u2019s Dan Jarvis, which aims to ensure that torture and related offences would not be covered by the five-year limit. The amendments have been supported by five Conservative MP, including former cabinet ministers Davis and Andrew Mitchell, as well as Crispin Blunt, Ian Liddell-Grainger and Pauline Latham. \u201cI am very concerned about the reciprocal danger to our soldiers if the government does not take a strong line,\u201d Mitchell said. The government \u2013 bringing the concluding stage of the bill in the run-up to Armistice Day this Sunday \u2013 says the bill is necessary to prevent soldiers from being affected by vexatious claims. A defence source added: \u201cWhilst it is admirable that Labour have this time chosen to fall down on one side or another of the vote \u2013 instead of sitting on the fence \u2013 they\u2019ve unfortunately chosen the side that confirms their long-held disdain for armed forces personnel.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
