Germany\u2019s RWE has warned that work to connect the growing number of windfarms off the UK coast to the onshore electricity grid will not keep pace with the government\u2019s goals unless decades-old regulation allows for faster investments. \u201cThe one thing that is delaying our projects is the onshore connections,\u201d said Tom Glover, RWE\u2019s UK boss. \u201cIt\u2019s getting quite serious. We are getting to the point of concern over whether that 40GW target can be met purely because of the onshore grid. It is only the onshore grid which could stop this happening.\u201d RWE is one of the world\u2019s largest renewable energy developers and plans to spend just under one-third of its investment budget in the UK. However, many of its projects have been delayed because the company has not been able to secure a grid connection for their projects in time to compete in the government\u2019s contract auction rounds. \u201cWe would like to see some anticipatory investment in the onshore network so that we can get the offshore connected in time,\u201d Glover said. The cost of energy grid investments is ultimately paid through energy bills, which means they are carefully considered by the industry regulator, Ofgem, to avoid saddling households with the cost of projects which aren\u2019t necessary. \u201cTen years ago it was completely understandable that the energy system operator and Ofgem didn\u2019t want to support these anticipatory investments because you could waste a lot of money preparing the grid for projects which didn\u2019t come on line,\u201d Glover said. \u201cThat regime and thinking was suitable for the industry at that time. But today we know that offshore wind is coming, we have a clear government target for 40GW, and we know that it will connect into the north-west, the north-east and the south-east of the energy grid,\u201d he added. The warning from a major energy generator follows similar criticism from energy network companies, including Scottish Power and National Grid, which have argued that the regulator should allow more investment or risk putting the UK\u2019s net zero climate targets in doubt. A spokesman for the regulator said its new regulatory framework \u201caims to secure billions of pounds of new investment in the grid to enable the UK to hit net zero and help drive the green recovery\u201d. \u201cWe are working with the government and the industry to develop proposals for a coordinated programme of anticipatory investments in the onshore and offshore networks to enable 40GW of offshore windfarms in the North Sea. All this must be delivered at the lowest cost to consumers, so we are challenging the industry to be much more efficient in how it runs and finances itself,\u201d the spokesman added. Energy companies have argued that the regulator\u2019s focus on energy bills ignores the wider economic benefits of green energy upgrades which would lead to lower-cost electricity and investments which could power a green economic recovery from the coronavirus. \u201cThe regulation needs to catch up with a different paradigm. It was perfect for where we were five to 10 years ago but it\u2019s different now,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
