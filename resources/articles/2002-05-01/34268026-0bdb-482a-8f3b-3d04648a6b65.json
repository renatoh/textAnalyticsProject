Referring to a pilot study of two institutions, commissioned by Hefce and UniversitiesUK, she said results suggested the extra funds needed to support, recruit and retain students from non-traditional backgrounds were as high as 35% over and above the average student's funding. The government currently offers a 10% premium. Reporting on the work of institutions since the publication of UniversitiesUK's report on social class and participation in higher education, published in March, Baroness Warwick outlined a number of schemes that universities across the country were adopting to widen participation. She said universities that have liaised with local schools, provided summer courses for new students, developed new course structures and provided support to students were all contributing to meeting the government's target of getting 50% of 18 to 30-year-olds into further education by 2010. She said alternative courses such as Plymouth University's surf science and technology degree encouraged participation and should not be discounted. But Baroness Warwick told the Lords \"there's no such thing as a free lunch\". \"There is now recognition in all quarters that to recruit, retain and transfer non-traditional students effectively into work or further study means additional costs. These costs make up a significant part of the total bill for the next three years of almost \u00a310bn, which we have submitted to the government. The access premium and the way in which it targets resources is a critical driver of change,\" she said. \"We need government to invest, and as our submission to the spending review makes clear - it's investment for success - not only for success in reaching the 50% target by 2010, or for success in widening participation, but investing to ensure the future success of an increasingly diverse student population.\" The pilot study was based on two institutions and its aim was to develop a methodology which could apply to the whole sector and which could then deliver indicative costings. It has yet to be completed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
