The 29-year-old, who has scored 28 goals in 69 appearances for the London club since signing from Cologne for \u00a311m two years ago, was the only one of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s trio of World Cup winners not involved in the squad at Goodison Park on Saturday having been granted extended leave after the tournament in Brazil. Podolski\u2019s contract does not expire until 2016 but he has found himself reduced to a peripheral role at the Emirates. Juve may prefer to take him on a season-long loan, though Arsenal will push for a permanent deal worth up to \u00a310m, with interest having alsocoming from Bundesliga sides such as Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
