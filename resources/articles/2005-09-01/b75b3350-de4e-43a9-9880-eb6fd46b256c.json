It may have been an overstatement when one MP claimed that in his constituency more school leavers went to prison than to higher education, but we now know that in rich boroughs nearly two-thirds of children expect to go to university and, in the poorest, less than one in 10. Fewer than half consider it an option, and while more students from all backgrounds have benefitted from higher education expansion, middle-class children have benefitted most. So yesterday's proposals from Sir Alan Wilson of the government's higher education directorate are welcome, if overdue. But they are cautious recommendations following the already cautious Schwartz report. Sir Alan has refused to come down in favour of the big bang solution of total post-qualification applications. Instead, alongside complete reform of the system, there will also be consultation on a hybrid plan where only a limited number of places would be available for post-qualification application - a kind of pumped-up clearing system. Improving access to higher education, and particulary the admissions process, is of course a notoriously delicate policy area. Universities are jealous of their right to choose whom they teach, and dismissive of what some regard as the sacrifice of academic standards to base social engineering. But introducing post-qualification applications has the advantage of leaving university admissions tutors in charge of the system, with the benefit of factual rather than hypothetical evidence that is shown to be wrong in more than a third of cases: 36% of grades are over-predicted. At the same time the 15% of students who do better than expected - predominantly from schools who have less experience of assessing the most able students - will be given the confidence to apply for a university or a course they might previously have considered to be beyond them. Such a change would rock other aspects of the existing system. In particular, A-level results would have to be delivered earlier, at least by early August, and directly to students themselves to enable them to make their final choices. The summer would be dominated by the admissions procedure, an uncomfortable breach with history for universities and students alike. But it would mean that the whole system of admissions was professionalised. Students who were rejected would get proper feedback about the reasons. It would mean the development of attributes against which candidates would be judged. No doubt the best schools would quickly ensure that their students knew how to meet them, but at least there would be the advantage of transparency and perhaps fewer accusations of prejudice. With the exception of the notably hard but correct decision on tuition fees, this government has all too often shied away from radical options. It may do so again now. And reform of applications, though useful, cannot be more than another building block in the long campaign to improve access. Yet if Tony Blair was casting round for a political legacy that old Labour could cheer as much as new Labour, then the ending of class discrimination in access to higher education should be a leading candidate. This is a defining challenge for a party whose objective is both a more equal and a more economically efficient society. The fear is that a less attractive aspect of Blairism - the desire to achieve consensus - may outweigh even the urge to modernise. But the government that is transforming prospects for pre-schoolers ought to do better than that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
