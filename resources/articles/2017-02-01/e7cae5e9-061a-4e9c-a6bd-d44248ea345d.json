Not surprising perhaps. Also not surprising that soon after last night\u2019s interview was recorded for Piers Morgan\u2019s Life Stories on ITV it emerged that Nigel and Kirsten were living separate lives. Oi, and don\u2019t you look so shocked about the singing, Piers \u2013 you, who once put the headline \u201cAchtung! Surrender! For you Fritz ze Euro Championship is Over\u201d as the headline on the front of your newspaper. It was never going to be the easiest one to stomach \u2013 Morgan\u2019n\u2019Farage, in similar blue suits, chewing the fat, guffawing at each other, in front of a very sympathetic audience. Not many of the 48% in there, by the sound of it. And it got less palatable still when Piers asked about a tryst Nigel had with a Latvian TV reporter. Were there, as was reported, ice cubes involved? Nooooo, don\u2019t go there, no one needs to have that image. He \u2013 Morgan, usually so self-effacing \u2013 had uncharacteristically been tweeting this one up for days. It was going to be a \u201chuge, huge TV event\u201d he said. And \u201cI confidently predict 52% of viewers will declare my show \u2018best TV ever\u2019 &amp; 48% \u2018worst TV ever\u2019.\u201d Because we live in age of extremes and polarisation, where everything has to be right over here or right over there, and there\u2019s nothing in between. But actually it was somewhere in between. Quite good television, if you had the constitution for it. The timing was odd, the day after the failure of the current Ukip leader to win himself a seat, but recorded long before, so the old leader couldn\u2019t talk about that. Or about whether Ukip has any relevance now that it\u2019s achieved its goal. You\u2019d think Morgan, being a news man, would have been concerned about its newsworthyness. But then these aren\u2019t political interviews. And, however odious you find both of them, you can\u2019t deny Farage\u2019s impact, and it\u2019s hard to argue that Morgan isn\u2019t a good interviewer. It wasn\u2019t all an easy ride; he pressed Farage on the vilest controversies and the racism in the party, held him to account, riled him (I think these were the promised \u201cfireworks\u201d). He asked if he thought he was a good father and good husband, about his testicular cancer and what it was like to nearly die in a plane crash, as well as about Donald Trump and whether he could ever envisage himself in No 10. He asked him if he thought politics had made him an unlikely sex symbol \u2026 Stop it! About the sex. No one, none of the 52% even, want to see Nigel Farage and sex in the same sentence. Or him talking about sex with Piers Morgan. And at the end of the hour, though I didn\u2019t like him any more than before, I did feel like I knew Nigel Farage a little better. Which must have been the idea. Oh, and he doesn\u2019t 100% rule out No 10. Brilliant\u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
