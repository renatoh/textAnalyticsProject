Irish homelessness expert Eoin O\u2019Sullivan will on Wednesday give the keynote address to Victoria\u2019s homelessness conference. O\u2019Sullivan will warn governments against concentrating their resources in crisis accommodation, such as shelters or hostels. Instead, he says, governments would save money and improve effectiveness by boosting permanent housing options through adding to social and community housing stocks. He is an advocate of the \u201chousing first\u201d model, which gives fast access to permanent housing, before deploying support and mental health services to ensure people are able to remain in accommodation. In the housing first model, people do not need to earn a right to housing by proving they are capable of managing their own lives. \u201cI think a lot of people find it difficult to make that conceptual leap,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan told Guardian Australia. \u201cI was walking in Melbourne last night and [many rough sleepers] appear quite dishevelled and people assume \u2018you couldn\u2019t give them a house\u2019, but in practice you can,\u201d he said. He said once people were in permanent housing, many social or health problems associated with homelessness tend to dissipate. In Australia, growth in social housing stock stagnated and numbers on waiting lists have increased between 2009 and 2016. The failure was one of several that caused the federal government to announce it would develop a new homelessness and housing agreement with the states. The number of homeless Australians in crisis accommodation, meanwhile, has increased significantly. Those in crisis accommodation who reported accessing homelessness services grew from 7,871 in 2012-13 to 14,569 in 2015-16. The Council to Homeless Persons chief executive, Jenny Smith, said Australian governments must commit to boosting the social housing stock. \u201cWith our federal government brokering a new national homelessness and housing agreement with the states, as a nation we need to commit to significant increases in social housing for low-income earners so we can emulate the success from abroad, not continue with failure,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe won\u2019t end homelessness in Australia by building more crisis accommodation while neglecting social housing, and cannot rely on the private market to house our most vulnerable citizens.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan points to Finland as an example of the benefits of boosting permanent housing stocks. There are just 52 shelter beds in the entire country, a reduction from 600 in 2008. Finland has now all but eradicated sleeping rough. \u201cNo matter what you do in the system, unless there\u2019s a supply of affordable housing, you\u2019re stymied all the time,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said. He also said recent moves in Sydney and Melbourne to disperse homelessness camps were ineffective and simply hid the problem. \u201cThere are other ways of doing it better, which are certainly more humane and more effective than simply dispersing people,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
