A woman, believed to be the baby's mother, was rescued from the sea near Holywood in County Down after the incident, and received medical treatment at a Belfast hospital. The woman and baby were on a Stena ferry from Cairnryan in Scotland to Belfast. A spokesman for the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said two ambulance crews treated the woman. \"She had been in the water for a while so you can understand that with the coldness of the water she would have been hypothermic,\" he said. A police helicopter, the Irish coastguard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution are all involved in the search for the baby. Police officers have boarded the ferry, which is docked in Belfast port. In a statement, a police spokesman said: \"It was reported that two people fell into the water from a ferry. One person was rescued and was taken to hospital for treatment for suspected hypothermia. The search operation is ongoing for the second person. This is believed to be a young child.\" The search for the baby, who is believed to be only days old, was due to resume at first light. All Stena sailings to and from Belfast harbour have been cancelled while the port is closed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
