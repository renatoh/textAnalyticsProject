Their push for the Premier League title has run into Arsenal and to keep their hopes alive, they must surely beat their rivals at White Hart Lane on Sunday. On its own, that adds up to pressure of the most extreme variety but the layers of the challenge go deeper. Pochettino\u2019s players will know that it will be the last derby to be staged at the stadium and the second-last fixture. Manchester United are to visit on 14 May. The club finally confirmed on Friday afternoon that they are to decommission the old ground and move to Wembley next season, while the work on their new 61,000-seat venue next to the existing site is completed. After 118 years, it has come down to nothing more than a couple of matches. It promises to be emotional, particularly as the league leaders, Chelsea, will have played earlier in the day at Everton \u2013 the most difficult game of their run-in. It is far from inconceivable that the west London club will drop points, which would leave Tottenham \u2013 currently four points back \u2013 eyeing a golden opportunity. Pochettino was peppered with questions on Friday about the significance of his team finishing above Arsenal for the first time in 22 years, which would be assured if they were to win the derby. He sidestepped this additional strand of the drama, maintaining his line that it was not about Arsenal, rather the quest for Tottenham to be better than all the other 19 clubs in the division. Around derby time there tends to be discussion of power shifts. Pochettino gave it short shrift. \u201cI think the power is equal,\u201d he said. Pochettino is preoccupied with broader issues and one of the biggest relates to mentality. Will his team be able to cope with everything that is thrown their way on Sunday? Will they be overtaken by the emotion? The manager was bullish with his answer. \u201cYou cannot ignore that it is a derby, with all that means, and we are also playing for another big thing, to be alive in the title race,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIt is a very tough job to be focused and it\u2019s true that emotion will be involved \u2013 maybe more than in other games. But the team has learned a lot. They know that football is emotion. It will not be new for the team to feel that emotion on Sunday. \u201cEvery game, you test your personality, your character and mentality but the good thing in our minds is that there is no doubt we can win. The most important thing is that the team is so strong in that aspect. We are so strong now in our minds.\u201d The White Hart Lane factor cannot be overlooked and even though the club said for sure only on Friday that this would be the final season there, Pochettino said the team had \u201cplayed every game like the last one\u201d. They are on a run of 15 successive wins at the stadium, with 12 of them having come in the league. The sense of momentum, together with the connection between the fans and players, has become a powerful tool. \u201cOur fans are so excited and so are the players,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cThat feeling, that energy, that the fans translate to the team, is fantastic. And it is key. The team plays exciting football and the fans are completely involved with them. They feel very close to the team. It\u2019s a fantastic union that can only benefit the club.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
