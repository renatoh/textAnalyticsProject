Dave is a victor in a really strong field, full of artists who stepped up and articulated what it is to live on a burning planet, in an absolute socio-political mess, while staring at your phone. Like you are now, perhaps. But thanks for following along nonetheless! We\u2019re off to bulk order some foul-mouthed Slowthai merch. It\u2019s a hugely, hugely deserving winner of the 2019 Mercury prize. Psychodrama straddles so much ground, zooming from grand black historical narratives to ultra-intimate stories of lives lived hand to mouth on the streets of south London. Written after he had already become famous, he seems wretched amid his success, traumatised by the poverty he\u2019s only just stepped up from, and jaded by the sex and money he\u2019s stepped into. And all of it with such pinpoint exactitude to his flow, such clear-headedness even when the road ahead seems fogged. It\u2019s often heavy going \u2013 a totally different kind of catharsis to the Idles or Slowthai albums for instance. But it\u2019s another British rap classic anointed by the Mercury judges, that is certainly the equal of former winners like Dizzee Rascal\u2019s Boy in Da Corner or Skepta\u2019s Konnichiwa. Dave looks ecstatic as he hugs anyone in his vicinity, and steps up. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to firstly thank God. I want to invite my mum up on stage.\u201d She comes up in a fabulous print dress and looks so chuffed. \u201cI want to thank everyone that made this happen, I want to thank all of the exceptional musicians who performed tonight... I respect you all so highly.\u201d He picks out Little Simz, Slowthai and Nao for special mentions, and thanks, \u201cmy mum, my family, my friends\u201d. And then finally pays tribute to his brother, who is currently in prison \u2013 a phone call from him closes out Psychodrama, and it\u2019s incredibly moving every time you hear it. \u201cEven though you can\u2019t be here today, I know you\u2019re watching this bro. I\u2019m so grateful.\u201d He picks up the mic again for another performance of Psycho. IT\u2019S DAVE! For his album Psychodrama. Annie Mac says: \u201cWhat a privilege it is to be in this room... what an exceptional list... The winning album showed remarkable levels of musicianship, artistry, courage and honesty.\u201d Ok... Lauren Laverne is building the tension, and says the judges have reached a decision. Getting the feeling this might have been one of the years where they\u2019re deciding right until the end. Now recapping the performances \u2013 they really were all excellent this year. Still vibing off Anna Calvi\u2019s vocal power and Dave\u2019s exactitude. And Slowthai and Idles\u2019 two flavours of punk. Laura says that what you missed on BBC Four was Slowthai saying: \u201cFuck Boris Johnson, fuck everything, and there\u2019s nothing great about Britain.\u201d Holding up a decapitated Boris head. Idles\u2019 guitarist goes one up on Slowthai by starting their performance of Never Fight a Man With a Perm shirtless, rather than ending it that way. This is one of the Bristol band\u2019s biggest anthems, railing against coked-up toxic masculinity by using the energy of a coked-up toxic man. \u201cYou look like a walking thyroid!\u201d Joe Talbot lashes out at the crowd, stepping about like a cartoon spider and staring like the lights have just come on in the club at 7am. He gives a handshake to Slowthai down in the crowd, who then gets up on stage to hug out a tremendous pair of closing performances. \u201cFuck Boris!\u201d That\u2019s how Slowthai\u2019s performance of Doorman begins. He\u2019s straight down amid the tables, taking off his extremely nice cardigan to reveal the aforementioned slogan T-shirt. You getting the theme yet? His nomination gong quickly becomes a phallus for some lewd gestures, then the T-shirt comes off too. And then BBC Four cuts it off in its prime. \u201cSlowthai, with his own views there,\u201d says a droll Laverne. Nao now, performing Another Lifetime. The bookies don\u2019t think Nao has a chance, and I\u2019m afraid they\u2019re probably right \u2013 her album, Saturn, has made a pretty light impression with only one week in the Top 100. Its airy sensuality and loose cosmic framework means it kind of orbits the rest of the decidedly earthbound shortlist, and so would be a truly outlying choice for the win. But even if it sits alongside Foals and Anna Calvi in the second-tier records here, she is a magnetic live presence. In fact, serious live chops are something shared by the whole shortlist this year. FYI: Slowthai has put a \u201cFuck Boris\u201d T-shirt on pre-order in his web shop and it is magnificent. He\u2019s up next... Matty and George from the 1975 send a message from Australia \u2013 they say they considered cancelling the tour to be at the Mercury prize, but didn\u2019t because they remembered the fans who put them and everyone on the shortlist where they are. While we get a video of a live performance of theirs, let\u2019s catch up with Cassie Kinoshi from SEED Ensemble, who was speaking to Laura on the red carpet. Laura: What did you want people to take away from this record? Cassie Kinoshi: I think the some of the most important things was the stuff on British politics, a lot of the stuff I feel needs to be continually discussed and highlighted. The track Wake is there to make sure that we continue to keep Grenfell at the forefront of people\u2019s minds. And the first track on there, The Darkies is about what it means to exist as a black British person in society where you\u2019re treated as an other. Laura: I feel like the existence of the record is political \u2013 so many of you got started with the Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors collective, and funding for British music has been cut so badly. I feel like we need 10 Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors \u2013 is there enough funding? Cassie Kinoshi: Yeah, I think there needs to be more. They do a great job, they\u2019ve done a lot and not just in jazz, but other genres, for example, the guys who play in Jorja Smith\u2019s band. Laura: In the UK, a lot of people are waking up to jazz for the first time and it\u2019s written about as if it\u2019s all the same. Can you talk about the specific sounds and traditions you drawn from? Cassie Kinoshi: It\u2019s very influenced by what we\u2019ve all grown up listening to \u2013 jazz is a genre that\u2019s really evolved over time and always picked up influences. So it\u2019s not one thing. Laura: What does this nomination mean to you? It feels like real recognition of a community. Cassie Kinoshi: Yeah, I think it\u2019s great in the way it\u2019s giving a platform to the band for people outside of the jazz community. Black Midi didn\u2019t do the red carpet apparently \u2013 divas! Their debut album Schlagenheim has been absolute Marmite on the Guardian\u2019s music desk \u2013 I love it, Laura hates it, and Alexis was someone in the middle with his 3-star review. I will admit it is very clever and in a way that could potentially be annoying, like a Mensa-affiliated nephew who keeps reciting pi to a thousand places during Christmas dinner. There\u2019s lots of faffing with time signatures, silly voices, squalls of improvised noise, and so forth; they\u2019re as well-drilled as you\u2019d expect a crop of Brit-schooled musicians to be. But I think this debut album absolutely hangs together and ends up transcending all this aforementioned stuff, to become something really vital and exuberant. In an extremely strong field, they are also the best live act on the shortlist. The likelihood of the entire judging panel uniting around their shared love for it is extremely low, but then again I expected my mum to hate it at a festival this summer and she was happily nodding along, in a cagoule, in 5/4 time, so you never know. Their live performance turns out to be a very free-form take on Bmbmbm, with Geordie Greep in maximum creep-vocal mode. They turn left into an epic noise-punk meltdown, complete with acrobatic front flips, and then a cute little funk coda. They could have done something much more crowdpleasing, even by their standards, but where\u2019s the fun in that? Dave now, with his \u201csocially conscious and unflinching lyrics\u201d celebrated by presenter Lauren Laverne. He takes on Psycho in a lime green Stone Island tracksuit. Where this is really trudging and grim on record, he brings more musicality to his flow when delivering it live, his band giving him silence and space to shout out his native Streatham. The halfway-point switch up is expertly etched by some on-point backing vocalists, as sax swims round the climax \u2013 and then it\u2019s back to mournful piano-driven clarity. A brilliant chapter to the Psychodrama. Cate Le Bon now, looking quite a lot like a supply art teacher who asks you to interpret your dreams using broken ink cartridges. Me and Laura were discussing this album \u2013 Reward \u2013 earlier today, and she said it was the only one that she could imagine listening to in years and years\u2019 time. It\u2019s a good point \u2013 compared with the rest of the shortlist, it doesn\u2019t feel as rooted in the cut and thrust of political and social life of the UK in 2019, but that is absolutely one of its strengths. If you haven\u2019t checked it out yet I absolutely implore you to \u2013 it is a magical blend of Broadcast, Vashti Bunyan, 60s girl group pop, scrappy post-punk and much more, i.e. something that only she could have come up with. Easily in the two or three best albums here, and it would be a wonderful curveball winner \u2013 but it just doesn\u2019t feel enough of the moment, perhaps. The song here was Home to You, home to some quality mallet percussion and a maypole-worthy chorus. So Laura, who is at the ceremony which is happening a bit further ahead of the broadcast, has said Slowthai held up a decapitated and bloodied Boris Johnson head during his performance, and shouted: \u201cFuck Boris!\u201d repeatedly. Incoming! Let\u2019s see how much BBC Four show of that, eh. My boys Fontaines DC now, with Boys in the Better Land. This is an absolutely rollicking track touching on the current wave of anti-British sentiment in Ireland \u2013 can\u2019t imagine why! Such a satisfying wall of sound \u2013 the kind of thing that other bands would make sound extremely leaden, but Fontaines keep buoyant and insouciant. SEED Ensemble now, a 10-piece UK jazz outfit led by Cassie Kinoshi, using that sumptuous, big-hearted post-Kamasi style \u2013 those six brass players out front generate such a warm front of sound, and the drummer gets a chance to do some extremely nimble fills. There is some really uplifting melodic writing on their record Driftglass, but I kind of wanted them to break out of the smooth lounge mood a bit more \u2013 for me, their track WAKE (For Grenfell) didn\u2019t have the unhinged ferocity it needed. You could equally argue, however, that such anger would have been too on-the-nose. Anyway, if Sons of Kemet couldn\u2019t win the prize last year with their even more politically incendiary Your Queen is a Reptile, this probably won\u2019t make it either \u2013 but credit to the Mercury for continuing to champion London\u2019s vibrant young jazz scene. Laura also caught up with Simz to discuss the reaction to her album. Laura: What kind of response did you get to the album? Little Simz: That\u2019s the thing about music \u2013 once it\u2019s out in the world it\u2019s out and you can\u2019t take anything back. And I don\u2019t wanna take anything back, I\u2019m super proud of it. I said everything I wanted to say, I got a lot off my chest. The reception has been crazy. I\u2019m happy it\u2019s connecting in ways I couldn\u2019t have dreamed of. I think it\u2019s let my fans know that they\u2019re not alone. Whatever it is, I still deal with the things that they deal with because I\u2019m human and a young woman in today\u2019s society and I go through the same things. Laura: You\u2019ve been outspoken about not getting support from the industry in the past \u2013 this must be really meaningful. Little Simz: Yeah, yeah, super meaningful. Even with that, I just think it was timing. I think maybe I wouldn\u2019t have been ready to deal with all that at that time in my life. Now I feel like I\u2019m coming into myself a lot more \u2013 I\u2019m more strong-minded, I feel like I\u2019m ready for whatever life\u2019s gonna throw at me. I\u2019m a lot more confident in myself, making the music I really want to make. Laura: It\u2019s so exciting to have you, Dave, Slowthai, they all make really striking statements about what it means to be young, black and British. Are those messages reaching the mainstream or is there more of a way to go? Little Simz: I think there\u2019s a ways to go. But I think we\u2019re getting there. Even outside of music, like Top Boy [which Simz stars in], that represents something that is bigger than ourselves and that will hopefully ignite change and make people really aware of and understand issues in gang culture and London. I think we\u2019re doing that through London as well. I feel like everyone\u2019s on the same mission. Laura: Do you have any hope that politicians will listen? Or will they keep demonising young people? Little Simz: I don\u2019t know, man. I don\u2019t pay attention to politics like that. I just hope that it is representing so many people \u2013 I hope they pay attention but who knows. Laura: What should have been nominated? Little Simz: Do you know what, I think they got \u2019em all in the bag! There was a lot of great albums but \u2013 removing myself \u2013 the 11 nominated are great. I really like Dave\u2019s album. Little Simz here, whose red carpet accessories created a crazed sort of equilibrium \u2013 that awful fat tie belongs at a New Jersey funeral but those socks and shoes absolutely pop. She is the most technically gifted MC in the lineup \u2013 not for nothing has Kendrick Lamar praised her as one of the best out there \u2013 and her album Grey Area is her best yet, with some beautifully hook-y choruses. Her actual lyrics are perhaps less impressive than their delivery, however \u2013 but that delivery! Hers is interior music, compared with the exterior music of Slowthai; Dave stands on the threshold between the two. As a trio they make a great showcase for the health of British rap, which is as stylistically broad as it\u2019s ever been. She changes into a white suit along with her band for her live performance of Selfish \u2013 the best and most instantly appealing track on the album \u2013 beginning on the piano before stepping up in a pair of amazing flares to bring the rapping up a gear, absolutely crushing the second verse. The propulsiveness of her flow paired with the smoother neo-soul backing is a perfect combination. Deploying eyeliner to almost Batman proportions, it\u2019s Anna Calvi, performing Don\u2019t Beat the Girl Out of My Boy. Her album is actually my least favourite on this list \u2013 there\u2019s a sturdy sense of songwriting, but to these ears her melodies staying on a well-marked, brightly lit bit of tarmac rather than straying off on more interesting paths. She\u2019s been nominated for all three of her albums, but I can\u2019t see this one pushing ahead of the competition here. That said, it has its fans, like the Guardian\u2019s Michael Hann, who gave it a five-star review on its release. And this was an awesome live performance \u2013 gorgeous guitar tone to her soloing, and spectacular hollering at its climax. Lauren Laverne calls it \u201ctruly magnificent\u201d, and she ain\u2019t wrong. Foals did a laudable protest on the red carpet, holding a banner reading: \u201cNo music on a dead planet\u201d, following on from fellow nominees the 1975, whose forthcoming album will open with a speech from Greta Thunberg. Laura spoke to the band on the red carpet. Laura: Do you agree with the critical view that this year\u2019s list shows a rejuvenated political focus in music, or has it always been there and people have only just woken up to it? Yannis Philippakis: I think that there\u2019s a genuine thrust of more political music as a response to the current climate, whether it\u2019s to do with British social issues or more of a general feeling that we\u2019re entering into more of a dystopia. I certainly can say, speaking from our experience, that there\u2019s no way we would have written this album five years ago. It\u2019s in direct reaction to what we perceive as the perils of the time, and I think that probably defines a lot of the records on the list. Laura: You have always been politicised in interviews \u2013 why not in music? Yannis: I don\u2019t know \u2013 maybe partly I felt that, at the time, I wanted to write lyrics that were more interested in my internal landscape. Maybe because it\u2019s our fifth record and a lot of that quarry\u2019s been mined already. I remember feeling that, certainly with the lyrics on these two records, I just wanted the lyrics to orbit the idea of the outside world and try to make the record more communicative and more direct. Laura: Has it changed the way fans talk to you, what they talk to you about? Yannis: It definitely changed the nature of interviews. And I think that a lot of fans, when we discuss with certain fans, the feeling is that they appreciate that the record is acting as a bridge between us and them, using social fabric as the \u2026 I was actively desiring using the things that unite us in a negative way as a bridge. Laura: What are you writing about on part two of this pair of albums? Yannis: Part two takes place in the aftermath of part one \u2013 the last couple of songs on part one are apocalyptic, essentially, and part two is about the individual trying to pick themselves back up and find a sense of purpose in the world. And then the second half of part two kind of goes into space. The last refuge! Laura: How have you found that sense of purpose? Edwin Congreave: I haven\u2019t. It\u2019s been hard on tour because we\u2019re in America and I\u2019m reading the news and I feel so disconnected from what\u2019s going on in the UK. In the last few weeks I\u2019ve been at home, and just through hanging out in my neighbourhood, I feel more rooted. I think it\u2019s really about connection. The live show kicks off with Foals playing On the Luna. They\u2019re one of the properly big, successful names on the list \u2013 four out of five of their records have reached the UK Top 3, and three of them have been nominated for the Mercury prize. They\u2019ve reached cruising altitude, both in terms of popularity \u2013 reliable festival headliners, one of the few convincing arena bands in the UK \u2013 and, to my mind, in terms of creativity. Big, muscular songs like 2013\u2019s Inhaler were such a step up for them; they\u2019ve now settled into this as their chief mode, and their songs are now just a little bit unremarkable as a result. But the likes of this, Exits, White Onions and In Degrees off their nominated album Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Pt 1 still have plenty of heft to them, even if their shape is familiar. As for my personal favourite, it\u2019s Dublin band Fontaines DC and their album Dogrel, which is just full of great tunes, top to tail: fast ones, slow ones, wry ones, sad ones. Like Slowthai, frontman Grian Chatten leans into his accent, and like Idles they face social ills head on \u2013 but with undoubtedly more sophistication and poetry. I think that were the jury to rally around a guitar record though, they\u2019d go for Idles, for their sheer populist vision and breakthrough success. There\u2019s always one bloke who makes absolutely no sartorial effort at all and this year it\u2019s That Guy On The Right from Fontaines DC, in tie-dye T-shirt and Adidas joggers. It\u2019s actually quite fashion in the end \u2013 he\u2019s probably been mood-boarding this for weeks. Laura Snapes caught up with the Idles boys on the red carpet: Laura: Your live shows are so rowdy, and the record is so personal and political \u2013 have people always understood the message in the music? If that matters? Joe Talbot: It\u2019s a language, it\u2019s very idiosyncratic to us. It\u2019s a democratic process, five voices come together and make one message, and it\u2019s still gonna be misread. We can only control us and our behaviours. The reason this was written was to be as mindful as possible with our message, our language, our narrative, but we can\u2019t lose sleep from that, we gotta keep going and enjoy ourselves. Laura: I\u2019m curious about the kind of things fans say to you about the record, and particularly men. Mark Bowen: We get people on social media and come up to us at the end of shows talking about how the album for them has been a form of catharsis, and they\u2019ve been able to open up more and talk more and that\u2019s had a positive effect on their lives. That\u2019s literally what\u2019s happened with us as well, that\u2019s how the album came about. It\u2019s nice to have that shared experience going from closed off, especially in my case, to being more in touch with our feelings and being able to share and move forward. Joe: We aimed at men cos we were aiming at ourselves. We were voicing our experiences of improving as individuals \u2013 my experience of going to therapy and learning about my masculinity as kind of like a stoic gag, and where I wanted to be, and realising how much weight I was carrying and how dangerous that was. In addiction, in silence, in all sorts of ways that it often comes out with men. Portraying that is holding up a mirror to people and giving you an opportunity to see that and change over time. The idea of having a violent show on stage \u2013 and it is a violent show \u2013 it\u2019s not, like, physically abusive but there is a violence there, violent brushstrokes, whatever that is, and that portrayal is a delicate balance. Sometimes we get it wrong and people in the audience have been awful, and we\u2019ve had to react to that and try and stop it. But over time, the more we display violence in a beautiful way \u2013 and the more mindful we become as a mirror \u2013 as something to hold up to them, hopefully the conversation will change over time and people will treat themselves with a bit more respect. Mark: The conversation about masculinity has been aimed at the inappropriate use of catharsis through that use of violence by men, and what we\u2019re trying to do, through what we\u2019re learning as a band, is how to use that catharsis in a safe, positive and respectful way. Joe: For us, though. This is us. We constantly need to learn how to open up and improve as a group because we travel together all the time. And put everything we have into the live shows. And that\u2019s a lot. Psychologically it\u2019s a lot. Our mental health suffers, my cycles of alcoholism and drug addiction are there, and you have to stay mindful and improve on that. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m lecturing anyone, but I don\u2019t know how to not be transparent because that\u2019s the language I\u2019ve learned over the last four years, and that\u2019s been the most vibrant for me. We\u2019re not trying to change the world, we\u2019re just trying to show people you can be an asshole or not be an asshole. Laura: Do you find it easy to communicate about feelings and hold each other to account when necessary? Joe: 100%. That\u2019s one of the first things we had to get through. Writing music, and a lot of people forget we actually write songs, it\u2019s a democratic process, and that means really quickly having to be like, \u201cthat\u2019s shit\u201d and not just that, but, \u201cthat\u2019s shit because\u2026\u201d We need to write what\u2019s best for this part, what\u2019s best for you, then you\u2019re like, OK, cool. And you work beyond that. That goes into our emotions. Two days ago we [points at bandmate Lee Kiernan] were talking about how we hadn\u2019t really connected recently for a couple of months, and then we get through this, then we\u2019ll realign properly, because we love each other. Mark: The reason for any relationship breaking down is poor communication, or negative communication or lack of communication. We\u2019re always open with each other and always ready to hear each other. Laura: The philosophy of the last album is \u201cjoy as an act of resistance\u201d, but is anything guiding the next record? Joe: It\u2019s still joy as an act of resistance. Absolutely. It\u2019s just \u2013 joy as an act of resistance was the opening of a conversation that we wanted to start in a very nursery-rhyme, overt way. Now this conversation has started, we\u2019ve had reaction from the press, but from an audience that we wanted to engage. So now, they\u2019ve responded, it\u2019s now our response to that response. We\u2019re always gonna stay momentary. There\u2019s no point in trying to force anything else. We\u2019re playing bigger rooms, talking to more journalists, spending more time with each other away from our families, so we have to start a new conversation. Having said that \u2026 I think that tonight\u2019s winner will be Idles. Another favourite with the bookies \u2013 most have them joint with Dave in second place \u2013 they are just as socially engaged as Dave but wear it all much more lightly. Their previous record, Brutalism, made their name with its reflections on grief and its savaging of the Tories over the NHS; nominated album Joy As An Act of Resistance adds even more besides. They slamdance against so many of today\u2019s worst ills \u2013 poor self-worth, toxic masculinity, class snobbery, xenophobia, the tabloid press \u2013 but with heads held high. Their sheer earnestness might irritate a few, but their big, honest emotion feels like a really necessary corrective to all the aforementioned awfulness. \u201cMy blood brother is Malala, a Polish butcher, he\u2019s Mo Farah\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s almost cringeworthy, but we do need this stuff saying out loud. They have made a bit of an effort tonight, too, with their blazers and stuff; loving the polo neck from frontman Joe Talbot, looking like Steve Jobs if the iMac hadn\u2019t worked out and he\u2019d become a stick-and-poke tattooist in a polyamorous relationship. The other much-fancied rapper \u2013 in every sense, just look at him up top! \u2013 is Dave, whose star is even higher than Slowthai\u2019s. He\u2019s collaborated with Drake, had a UK No 1 single, and created not one but two of the moments of Glastonbury 2019: when he brought on the surprisingly on-point bucket-hatted teenager Alex, and when he thanked Stormzy for everything he\u2019d done for the UK scene, during the latter\u2019s Pyramid stage headline set. Stormzy is on the voting panel this year and will no doubt be doing some extremely charismatic and persuasive gong-banging for Dave \u2013 but will the rest of the panel agree? For me this album, Psychodrama, is spellbinding, occasionally flawed \u2013 the therapist framework is a bit cringe, and muddies the sledgehammer ending where his real-life brother calls him from prison to congratulate him \u2013 and actually much bleaker than it seems, coming as it does in the wake of Dave\u2019s breakthrough fame. He seems to almost buckle under the weight of his concern for his peers, the trauma of his impoverished past and the history of violence against black people. Even when he\u2019s rapping about getting head he seems to be staring into the middle distance. It\u2019s an important, clear-eyed and devastating record, but arguably difficult to truly love \u2013 still, I think the bookies are mad not to have this as their favourite. The bookies\u2019 favourite \u2013 which never wins \u2013 is Slowthai with his album Nothing Great About Britain. This would be a worthy winner: quite apart from his lyrics, his voice is one of the most satisfying here. His broad east Midlands burr is another one of the strong regional accents that are currently keeping British rap so tangibly British \u2013 alongside Aitch, Jaykae, Jay1, Bugzy Malone et al \u2013 and he moves through his lyrics with the bobbing and weaving stance of a grime or garage MC, but there\u2019s straight up punk and trudging hip-hop production too. Lyrically it\u2019s really evocative \u2013 social realism blended with neat wordplay (\u201cselling wraps to a mummy\u201d) to make a portrait of working-class Britain that is neither moping nor moralistic. Drug Dealer also has one of the best disses in ages: \u201cYou\u2019re mediocre like Katie and Peter.\u201d Laura says he has been the toast of the red carpet, storming up and down, beer in hand. He said that if he won, he\u2019d spend the money on \u201cstupid stuff! Like blow up a car! ... Nah, I just wanna have time to spend with my friends and family.\u201d He also revealed that he has a special pair of pants for his performance this evening \u2013 this being a man who will get down to his smalls at the slightest provocation. The award tends to be decided on the night, with the judges reconvening one final time, so I don\u2019t think nominees the 1975 will be winning \u2013 they can\u2019t make it to the ceremony because they\u2019re on tour in Australia. Their album A Brief History of Online Relationships has been rightly lauded, and in some ways is the perfect album for two of the main tenets of the Mercury prize remit: \u201cto recognise and celebrate artistic achievement\u201d and \u201cprovide a snapshot of the year in music\u201d. In blending new wave, disco, ambient techno, Big Music, and acoustic balladry \u2013 in the first five songs alone! \u2013 with powerful pop hooks, it absolutely nails the first, and by confronting technophobia, Donald Trump, addiction and more, it feels absolutely rooted in 2019. But with two Brit awards earlier in the year, and no one to hand the prize to this evening, the panel will likely decide it\u2019s better to give someone else a look in here. Every other one of the nominated artists will be performing tonight. Here\u2019s the judging panel. A bunch of industry people \u2013 of whom the most notable is the wonderful Tshepo Mokoena formerly of this parish and now editorial director of Vice \u2013 and some famous people too: Stormzy, Jamie Cullum, Jorja Smith, Gaz Coombes of Supergrass, and Radio 1 pair Clara Amfo and Annie Mac. You can expect the Sun to have employed a body language analyst to compare Stormzy and Jorja Smith within the hour. The shortlist once again, with links to our reviews of the albums: Anna Calvi \u2013 Hunter Black Midi \u2013 Schlagenheim Cate Le Bon \u2013 Reward Dave \u2013 Psychodrama Foals \u2013 Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Fontaines DC \u2013 Dogrel Idles \u2013 Joy As an Act of Resistance Little Simz \u2013 Grey Area Nao \u2013 Saturn SEED Ensemble \u2013 Driftglass Slowthai \u2013 Nothing Great About Britain The 1975 \u2013 A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships Welcome to the Mercury prize ceremony 2019! This is one of the strongest fields in the history of the prize, with none of the outright stinkers that have managed to sneak on to shortlists in recent years (Alt-J, Everything is Recorded, Glass Animals, etc) and plenty of records that really have something to say about the way we live now. I\u2019ll be liveblogging all the arrivals and red carpet lewks, and then the ceremony as it is screened on BBC Four from 9pm; deputy music editor Laura Snapes is covering news at the ceremony itself and will be sending back bits of goss. The winner will be announced at around 10.10pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
