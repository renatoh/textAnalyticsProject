On tonight's final World Cup Football Daily, we've got AC Jimbo, James Horncastle and Scott Murray in the studio, Rafa Honigstein and Jonathan Wilson in Rio and Archie Rhind-Tutt in Munich to discuss every aspect of the final and plenty more besides. And that, as they say, humanoids, is it. Thanks for listening to us whitter on for the last month. We'll see you again in August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
