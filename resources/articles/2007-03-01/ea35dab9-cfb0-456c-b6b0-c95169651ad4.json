I myself have had horrible experiences like this. I remember watching Miss Congeniality and having a terrible premonition that I was going to die of embarrassment while watching future Sandra Bullock films in which she was going to act in exactly the same horrifically annoying way. Then I watched Miss Congeniality 2, and my scalp prickled with fear. I sat down to The Lake House, her supernatural romcom with Keanu Reeves, and it was all I could do not to scream with terror. Now this. How many times can the nightmare that is Sandra Bullock keep recurring?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
