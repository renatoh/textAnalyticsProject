Tom's Kitchen is a facsimile of his successful Chelsea brasserie; the menus are identical, offering posh gastropub dishes in a British vein. If the ingredients are carefully chosen \u2013 Daylesford lamb for instance \u2013 then there are prices to match; the fish and chips is nearly \u00a320, though the cod is line-caught. Still, a salmon rillette starter may have fish sourced from Loch Duart, but the resulting dish was distinctly underwhelming with an anaemic flavour. Mains were more successful, with an exuberant seasonal vegetable risotto and a succulent slow roast pork belly, abetted by some tasty Chantenay carrots. For dessert the cheeseboard was too cold \u2013 the Stinking Bishop should have been collapsing on the plate \u2013 but the Chocolate Hot Pot was rich and lingered in the mouth. Overall, it's unpretentious, well-executed fare, though the prices may leave you hankering for a little extra.

Cheese-tasting in Chorlton kicks things off, but things really start heating up at the Chilli Lovers' Fair, incorporating a chilli-eating contest, as well as introducing tasters to the delights of Edible Ornamentals' chilli beer and chilli toffee from One Stop Hot Shop. Next Saturday, there are 150 varieties of whisky to be sampled at the Castlefield Rooms, while Albert Square hosts a chocolate festival bringing together makers from around the UK. Next week, there's a typically lengthy list of chefs and celeb foodies speaking, pouring and cooking, including the Guardian's own Matthew Fort, as well as Paul Heathcote (Heathcotes), Northcote Manor's Lisa Allen and even a representative from Holland's, the north-west's mainstream pie supplier of choice. Various venues, Fri to 11 Oct, foodanddrinkfestival.com Stuart Goodwin The Three Tuns, Henley-on-Thames Chef-patron Simon Bonwick won rave reviews at the Blackboys Inn with his signature French bourgeois cooking replete with a contemporary edge and fresh, clean flavours. With his new pub venture, not only does Bonwick repeat his culinary success, he's given an even better showcase in charmingly rustic surroundings and a grown-up drinks list rendered at the bar by his business partner Oliver Reichhold. The minimalist menu brings provenance to the fore and includes starters such as tuna tartare with liquorice and saffron dressings, exuding a perfectly judged harmony of ingredients and tastes. Toasted salsify with cep cream and cep dressing is also good. Mains are comforting: the star is the meltingly tender and satisfying daube of beef with truffle, while a generically named dish of milk, camomile and chestnut rice is a wonderfully risotto-like vegetarian option. Looks like Bonwick has another hit on his hands. 5 Market Place (Tel: 01491 411588) price per head \u00a330 Humayun Hussain"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
