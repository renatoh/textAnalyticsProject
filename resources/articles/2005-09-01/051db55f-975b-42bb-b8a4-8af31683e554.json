So how does it work? The backpack consists of bag suspended from a fixed frame by vertical springs. As the bag is moved up and down by the wearer's walking motion it creates enough mechanical energy to drive a generator mounted on the frame. Meanwhile the Globe &amp; Mail adds: Dr Rome said the prototype weighs 10 to 15 pounds, but his team hopes to bring the weight down to about six or seven pounds, slightly heavier than a normal large backpack."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
