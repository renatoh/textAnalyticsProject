The 16-year-old Watson, who defeated Japan's Miyabi Inoue 7\u20136 (7\u20131), 4\u20136, 6\u20134 to join Laura Robson in the quarter-finals, was born in Guernsey and is based at the Bollettieri Academy in Florida. Her father, Ian, said yesterday: \"She is a very athletic girl. They were distraught at the swimming club when she chose to concentrate on tennis. I remember her picture was in the local paper once after she'd won the freestyle, breaststroke, butterfly and backstroke events for her age group at a gala.\" While Robson, the fifth seed, was expected to do well, Watson's progress has been more of a surprise, although she has a world junior ranking of 13 and was seeded nine in Melbourne. She played the third seed, Ksenia Pervak of Russia, in a quarter-final earlier today. Watson recalled when, in 2000, he and his wife first realised their daughter was good at tennis. \"She was only seven and put her name down, unknown to us, for a short tennis tournament at our club. She came to tell us she'd got through the first round, then the second, and finally she came out and said, 'Oh, I've won the final'. After that we just nurtured her talent.\" Her progress was such that in 2004 she went to the Bollettieri Academy in Bradenton, Florida. She is coached there by the Peruvian Percy Melzi. Her parents considered sending her to a British academy but did not feel easy about the marriage of \"academia and sport\". They had heard of the Bollettieri centres and decided to find out more. \"We left her at Bollettieri's for a week and told her we weren't going to contact her at all while she was there,\" Watson said. \"When we picked her up she said, 'Dad, I want to come here'. \"When she went she was so mature and independent we never once got a call of complaint from her.\" For four years she lived in the dormitories but for the past 18 months her mother has been living with her in Florida and has been with her in Melbourne for the Australian Open.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
