The problem is when outcomes are confused by ideology. The language of \"activism\", \"left\" and \"right\" etc should have no place in the educational debate. What springs out of John Harris's even-handed article is the passion each school has in creating what it believes are effective environments for children's development. But this is not exclusively the province of free schools: many educators in state schools, local authorities and even the Department for Education are driven by this same desire and not poisoned by ideological dogma. Tim Taylor Trowse, Norfolk Free schools have the potential to become unregulated centres for prejudice, ignorance and exclusivity, because they will be permitted to be run outside the remit of state supervision and cherry-pick intake. The myth that they are responsive to local needs is shattered when you examine those who have set up such schools, the children they allow in them, and the schemes that were rejected which had about them far more of a sense of localism. The dead hand of central government lies on these schools because they are controlled from the centre, not at local level, under the spurious title of \"free school\" while stuffing the pockets of privateers. Peter Cameron Kingsteignton, Devon Any dieter will tell you that you will lose half a stone in a week, but a lot of that will be water. I've lost nearly two stone recently. I gave up sugar and white flour, and ate smaller portions but with more greens and protein, and upped my exercise levels. I also bought a skipping rope. I don't believe in evil, but if I did, it would look like sugar. B Merryweather Brighton \"Suddenly the government decided to make tax avoidance a moral issue\". I think you'll find it was UK Uncut protesters who did that. The government was merely stung into some kind of a response. (Tax) credit where it's due, please.

Siobhan Wall Amsterdam As a single mum who was without my boys at Christmas because they went to their dad's, Erika Rudasha story about spending it in in a B&amp;B with her young daughter certainly provoked a few wobbles. Lucy Wilkes Lewes, East Sussex I was interested to read that Peter Jones has invented Boxing Day as a life-changing concept. He describes it as a day with no plans, where you put everything on hold, and that leaves you rested, energised and happy. I wonder what he does on Sundays? Penny Dakin Kiley Didcot, Oxfordshire Call me a pleb, but both the Shelter and the care home Christmas dinners looked more inviting than the Savoy's. Also, how many homeless people could you feed for the \u00a3390 that the Ritz was charging? Graeme Ross Gateshead, Tyne and Wear I never wear blusher, but even if I did I would not contemplate one called Deep Throat.
