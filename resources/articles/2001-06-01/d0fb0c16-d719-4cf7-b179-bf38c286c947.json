This means that the first people to go all have to leave it by backing out. I had a near miss recently with another car as I was leaving. I wonder if there are rules governing the layouts of employers' car parks. There are no specific rules covering the layout of private car parks. Your employer is not obviously breaching a law by having you back out. But employers do have to meet basic health and safety standards in the workplace and they have a duty to take reasonable care to prevent harm coming to neighbours and passers-by. If you are backing out into a very busy road or in front of a school, it is more likely that your employer is being negligent. They might be well advised to put up warning notices - both to employees and to other pedestrians or cars in the area. And it might be best to reduce the number of spaces in the car park. In your mind, you will be weighing up the potential danger and whether you want your employer to make turning possible by cutting down on the number of spaces available in the car park. You might be one of the people told you cannot park there anymore."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
