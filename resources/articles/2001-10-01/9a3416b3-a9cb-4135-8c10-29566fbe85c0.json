Who he?", "bodyText": "Midway through Mayor Rudy Giuliani's Wednesday press conference, a reporter sneezed. 'Wanna get checked?' rasped the mayor - his only reference to anthrax during a feel-good encomium to his beloved New York Yankees, busy symbolising the city's fighting spirit with a miraculous comeback in the play-offs for baseball's World Series. In Washington that day, Congress closed itself down in the same breath as instructing all other Americans to carry on as usual. New York governor George Pataki started taking the antibiotic of the moment, Cipro, after anthrax spores were found at his Manhattan office. Urged by his staff to do likewise, after visiting every anthrax scene in the city, even sorting some mail himself, Giuliani declined. So let's take rugged Rudy's lead, and calm down long enough for a dispassionate examination of the facts. Every day last week saw a new case of anthrax confirmed somewhere along the eastern seaboard; in Manhattan alone it progressed from NBC to ABC to CBS to Rupert Murdoch's New York Post. Even the most diehard sceptic might concede a pattern here. Media offices yet to have a scare in the mailroom are beginning to feel left out. One man in Florida has died. All other eight confirmed cases are well on their way to recovery. The gallant British-born woman who opens the mail of CBS News anchor Dan Rather has not even missed a day's work. Cutaneous rather than pulmonary anthrax - yes, we're all experts now - is less serious than flu, and yet we are haunted by it. One sneeze or pimple, and New Yorkers head for the hospital. One suspicious envelope is enough to close a building, one spilt packet of powdered milk enough to ground a plane. From water-cooler to tap-room to dinner-table, the conversation invariably comes round to anthrax. Apart from the word itself, with its menacing sci-fi ring, the fear is all in the timing. Although these cases are only now coming to light, all the letters carrying this same sophisticated, 'weapon-grade' strain of the disease were mailed soon after 11 September. And these are the first cases of anthrax in the US for nearly 30 years. Whoever is sending them can only be called terrorists. Whether or not they are also Islamic fundamentalists we do not yet know, although the FBI is doing its damnedest to prove it. 'I wouldn't put it past them,' was the considered verdict of President Bush, as he unnerved Americans even more by leaving the country in mid-crisis. What will happen next. Smallpox? Suicide truck-drivers? Wherever this scary white powder is coming from (a deeply ironic reminder of that other white powder which fuelled Manhattan through the Nineties), it is surely the prelude to the next World Trade Centre-style spectacular. That, in shell-shocked New York, is a universal assumption. The invisibility of the war in Afghanistan ensures that 24-hour TV news offers little but wall-to-wall anthrax. Which is why we may be forgiven for opening our mail with unusual care, for feeling more scared than Giuliani wants us to. The mayor is fond of citing British stiff upper lips during the Blitz, which may also be why Prince Andrew turned up to give him an honorary knighthood. But hang on a minute: isn't Andrew the one better-known (if at all) here as an ageing playboy? The one whose ex-wife does those ads for Weight-Watchers? Is that the best the British monarchy can do to encourage New Yorkers through their own Blitz? Where is Charles? Him we've heard of. Grateful as he was for the gong, Sir Rudy didn't consider Andrew important enough to escort him personally around Ground Zero, leaving that to New York's fire chief (who got the CBE). Such is the status of British royalty these days, while Tony Blair is hailed on all sides as a neo-Churchill, the president of the rest of the free world. 'Sorry,' emailed one of my UK penpals, 'but I just can't take the anthrax seriously until it arrives here.' Well, frankly, we New Yorkers won't be at all surprised if it does. Then see if you, too, don't get a case of the jitters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
