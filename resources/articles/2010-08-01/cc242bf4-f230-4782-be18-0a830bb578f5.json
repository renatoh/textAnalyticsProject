Setting off from Kiplingcotes station, near Market Weighton, I followed the disused railway track, which was edged with wildflowers in varying shades of purple: knapweed, scabious, cornflower, vetch, harebells, and feathered rosebay willowherb. All were attracting an abundance of butterflies, mainly whites and browns. I only saw singletons of red admiral and small tortoiseshell, and three peacocks. On the bridge over the country lane, gazing past the scrubby grassland and rosebay willowherb over to the rolling hills of golden corn, something caught my eye: a red kite was flying over the field, circling and reeling round, almost skimming the ears of corn before rising up again. Horseshoe prints in the dried-up mud brought the Kiplingcotes Derby to mind. It is said to be the oldest horse race in England, and was introduced nearly 500 years ago, as proof of how a horse had come through the winter. Run on the third Thursday in March, it is a gruelling four-and-a-half-mile race along farm tracks and country lanes. Depending on how many entrants there are, the rider who comes in second can often take home the most prize money! I arrived at the Kiplingcotes Chalk Pit nature reserve, owned and managed by the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust since 1974. The nature reserve is home to 500 species, with 250 invertebrates and 90 birds. Yellow bird's-foot trefoil was attracting common blue butterflies, while the pretty brown-and-orange small copper seemed to like the clumps of wild marjoram. Watching butterflies is very relaxing: I was awakened from my daydream by the chacking of a magpie, as if to tell me to be on my way, for the sun had disappeared behind darkening clouds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
