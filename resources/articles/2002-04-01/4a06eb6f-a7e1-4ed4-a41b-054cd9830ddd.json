He was found hanging at his north London home, where he lived alone. Friends say that the former Covent Garden porter had been deeply depressed by the deaths in recent years of his wife Joan and youngest son Simon from cancer. Conteh, who won the WBC light-heavyweight title in 1974, led the tributes last night. \"He was a great trainer, but more than that he was my mentor,\" he said. \"I remember him as a great motivator. He was there at the beginning and with me at the end.\" Francis was able to instil discipline and fitness in Conteh, a boxer who was probably as talented as any British fighter to have graced the ring, and his formula changed little over the ensuing years. When Bruno won his WBC world heavyweight title in 1995 it would have been fair to reflect that many fighters have been more technically accomplished than him, but rarely, if ever, was a man's physique honed into better shape. \"He didn't mind what time he had to get up to run with his fighters over Hampstead Heath; he loved it,\" said the veteran fight manager Dennie Mancini. \"He would run with Conteh for five miles, then have him sprint up a hill before doing calisthenic exercises. Then he'd have him run back down and jump in the pond for a swim.\" Francis's own level of fitness was inspirational and in Bruno he found the ideal pupil. The two worked happily at training camps before major contests, where Francis would say: \"Believe it or not, one of the problems I have with Frank is that he can train too much. I have to make sure he doesn't leave it in the gym.\" His partnership with Bruno was also a happy one and their finest moment came with Bruno's world title victory over Oliver McCall. Although Francis was reluctant to boast of his achievements, there was unanimous acclaim within the sport for his ability to prepare a fighter - even if some questioned his tactical acumen. \"Fitness and conditioning was his life, and his strength was that he was a very good teacher,\" said the former promoter and manager Mickey Duff. \"If you were asked to name two of the best fighters to come out of Britain you would have to say Conteh and Bruno - and they were with him. Nobody could have done much better than he did with the talent at hand and I am so sad that his life has ended in this way.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
