If victory can be achieved at the Riverside next Thursday, this dogged performance will look even better. Boro lost their last two away ties in Europe and progressed and that should act as an omen for Steve McClaren's team. Other good news is that, while Boro will be stronger next Thursday, Steaua Bucharest will be weaker. Nicolae Dica's 30th- minute strike separates the teams but the four yellow cards for Steaua included one each for Banel Nicolita and Sorin Paraschiv. Those two players will be missing on Teesside and, given that Steaua are by their own admission not bulging with quality, that should tell. So, too, should the likely return of Gareth Southgate, Chris Riggott and Mark Viduka. With Sven-Goran Eriksson present - Middlesbrough fielded five Englishmen in the starting XI with four more on the bench - Boro endured a tense last half- hour and McClaren mentioned \"fatigue\" afterwards. It cannot be allowed to set in permanently, though, as Boro head for an FA Cup semi-final against West Ham at Villa Park on Sunday. \"This was our 57th game of the season, so we're bound to be tired,\" said McClaren, once again the subject of rumours regarding England, although senior figures at Middlesbrough last night refused to comment on these. \"But in the last 20 minutes, half-hour, we showed our character, grit and determination. We dug in. At 2-0, 3-0, it might have been impossible to come back but at 1-0 I have seen enough tonight to think we'll get chances in the second leg. I'm delighted we're still in the tie but we know we can play better.\" Everything McClaren does is now scrutinised as never before and, if improvisation is a managerial quality, then he earned marks last night. Faced by an intimidating, throwback arena and crowd, and lacking his two regular centre-halves, McClaren selected Ugo Ehiogu and the 19-year-old Matthew Bates. It was the biggest night of the Stockton teenager's career and he can review it with pride. Bates is no novice - he appeared in the draw at AZ Alkmaar before Christmas and has accumulated more European experience than Ehiogu this season - but it was still a personal display that warranted McClaren's assessment: \"Mature\". As with the rest of the team, Bates and Ehiogu were better in the first half, despite conceding, and were grateful to Mark Schwarzer for a 53rd-minute tip away from a close-range header by Dorin Goian. Eight minutes later Schwarzer made another block, this time from the dangerous Dica after an error by Stuart Parnaby. Those two incidents fit the \"defining moments\" McClaren usually talks about and, although Schwarzer and Ehiogu collided later, creating a brief opportunity for Steaua, Massimo Maccarone, a second-half substitute, worried the Romanians with a useful late shot. But Boro were wobbling at that point. McClaren said he thought his side were \"in control\" for most of the first half and until the half- hour Middlesbrough were comfortable. As in Basle they were taunted before kick-off with a display of the opposition's thoughts. \"Finala\" was the message spelled out by fans pumped up by a couple of hours of eastern bloc Europop. But Steaua were unable to tear Boro apart in the manner those supporters will have hoped. There was no sense of inevitability about a home breakthrough. Indeed Stewart Downing was prominent on the left and Aiyegbeni Yakubu was close with a 20-yard shot on a Boro breakaway. But the half-hour brought Steaua their lead and disappointingly for the Teessiders it originated from a throw-in. George Ogararu took it and found his captain Mirel Radoi in space five yards outside the area. From Radoi the ball went first-time to Dica who had George Boateng for company but was able to swivel and shoot, his right-footed effort soaring into the net past Schwarzer's forlorn dive. Playing some good possession football, mainly through Fabio Rochemback, Boro stabilised. At times they were also able to counter-attack and twice before half-time they might have equalised. In the 41st minute Yakubu squeezed between two blue shirts to make contact with a Boateng cross. The Nigeria striker appeared not to know too much about what happened next but the ball hit the turf and then bounced on to the crossbar. A minute later from a Downing corner Franck Queudrue won a header that resulted in a seven-yard snapshot from James Morrison. Carlos Fernandes, Steaua's Portuguese keeper, parried the ball away. That was to be Boro's attacking highlight. They will look forward to a few more next Thursday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
