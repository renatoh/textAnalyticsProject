Shares slumped by 6.7% after a whistleblower revealed a vast data breach that affected tens of millions of people. Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic are demanding answers. In America, senators are pushing for senior executives to be questioned on Capitol Hill. The Connecticut Attorney General is also opening a probe. In the UK, the information commissioner is launching an investigation. The ICO may search the offices of Cambridge Analytica on Tuesday, after Theresa May\u2019s spokesperson expressed concern over the revelations. Tonight, Channel 4 have revealed how the company\u2019s bosses talked of using honey traps, spies and fake news to help clients World stock markets were also dragged down by worries that Donald Trump\u2019s steel and aluminium tariffs would spark a trade war. In London, the FTSE 100 sagged to a 15-month low That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. Just in: the Connecticut Attorney General is launching an investigation into Facebook. It will centre on the Observer\u2019s revelations that the Facebook profiles of 50 million people were harvested by Cambridge Analytica. Attorney General George Jepsen says: \u201cNews reports that personal user information from Facebook profiles was provided to third parties without user consent are concerning and raise serious questions about how this happened in the specific situation involving Cambridge Analytica and about Facebook\u2019s policies and practices more generally. Today, my office has in writing initiated an inquiry asking Facebook to answer a series of questions about this matter. While we cannot comment further at this time, Connecticut residents should know that my office takes privacy matters very seriously, and we will move as quickly as we responsibly can to get to the bottom of this situation.\u201d Bloomberg have more details of the growing pressure to make top tech executives face a Capitol Hill grilling: U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have called on the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to bring in technology company CEOs, including from Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, for public questioning In a letter Monday to Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, Klobuchar and Kennedy said they have \u201cserious concern regarding recent reports that data from millions of American was misused in order to influence voters.\u201d \u201cThe lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights,\u201d the senators wrote. A hearing with the CEOs would allow the committee to learn \u201cwhat is being done to protect Americans\u2019 data and limit abuse of the platforms, as well as to assess what measures should be taken before the next elections.\u201d Global stock markets are now on their worst run since last November, according to Reuters data. Facebook was obviously one factor behind today\u2019s selloff. But, traders are also worried about a protectionist trade war breaking out. This overshadowed the \u2018Brexit breakthrough\u2019 between the UK and Brussels over a transition deal this morning. Breaking! Around $36bn has been wiped off Facebook\u2019s value today, as trading ends in New York after a rough session. Shares in the embattled social media giant ended down 6.7% at $172.5. That looks to be its biggest one-day loss in four years (and its biggest drop in value ever). That takes Facebook\u2019s market capitalisation down to just over $500bn, from $537bn on Friday night. Other tech stocks also suffered, dragging the Nasdaq down by 1.8%. The broad S&amp;P 500 index fell by 1.4%, with Facebook the biggest faller. Facebook\u2019s decision to hire a data forensic firm to examine the claims against Cambridge Analytica has caused some concern. Particularly as the UK Information Commissioner is planning to obtain a warrant on Tuesday to search its offices. New details of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s activities are emerging tonight. Undercover Channel 4 News reporters have recorded CEO Alexander Nix discussing the tactics it used. Here\u2019s a flavour: In a series of meetings with a reporter posing as a representative of a wealthy Sri Lankan family seeking political influence, Cambridge Analytica executives initially denied the company was in the business of using entrapment techniques. But Nix later detailed the dirty tricks the company would be prepared to pull behind the scenes to help its clients. When the reporter asked if Cambridge Analytica could offer investigations into the damaging secrets of rivals, Nix said it worked with former spies from Britain and Israel to look for political dirt. He also volunteered that his team were ready to go further than an investigation. \u201cOh, we do a lot more than that,\u201d he said over dinner at an exclusive hotel in London. \u201cDeep digging is interesting, but you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that\u2019s too good to be true and make sure that that\u2019s video recorded. Newsflash: Facebook has just released a statement, saying it has hired a forensics firm to investigate the claims against Cambridge Analytica. The social media giant says that Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan, who orchestrated the harvesting of Facebook data, has verbally agreed to take part in the audit. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie has \u2018thus far declined\u2019, Facebook says. The Wall Street selloff is gathering pace. Facebook\u2019s problems seem to be sparking wider alarm in the markets, with investors also worried about the risk of a trade war (and the prospect of a US interest rate rise on Wednesday) With just over an hour\u2019s trading to go, the Nasdaq is down almost 3% while the Dow is staring at a 450-point loss (-1.8%). More than $100bn has been wiped off the value of America\u2019s biggest tech companies today. Facebook is the worst performer (-7%), shedding around $35bn at pixel time. According to the Financial Times, that is one of the ten biggest one-day losses (in dollar terms) ever suffered by a technology company. Every member of the Nasdaq is currently in the red; Alphabet/Google is down 3.5%, Amazon are down 2.3%, NVIDIA has lost 4.8%, Apple is off 2% and Microsoft has shed 2.2%. The revelations about how Cambridge Analytica harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles is fuelling calls for tighter regulation of the tech sector. And if that happens, the world\u2019s largest technology firms could find their growth squeezed, making it hard to justify their immense valuations (Facebook is still worth half a trillion dollars, despite today\u2019s share price slide) Jake Dollarhide of Longbow Asset Management believes the implications could be huge. He says (via Reuters): \u201cThere\u2019s the thought that the government might try to regulate tech. You open a slippery slope. If you regulate Facebook what\u2019s to say that wouldn\u2019t have a domino effect. Google, maybe Uber?\u201d What\u2019s to stop the government for getting its fingers in all these areas. People have thought right now the tech growth rate has no boundaries, no ceiling. Today people are beginning to question that. If it\u2019s the case now, will it still be the case in the future.\u201d US senator Amy Klobuchar, who represents Minnesota, is calling for top tech executives including Mark Zuckerberg to be called to account: Facebook\u2019s share price is stubbornly in the red, and on track for its worst day in five years: The UK government has weighed in on the unfolding Facebook data story. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman has said the PM backs an investigation by the information commissioner into the use of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica, adding: The allegations are clearly very concerning, it\u2019s essential people can have confidence that their personal data can be protected and used in an appropriate way. More here: It\u2019s a grim start to the week for stock markets, as a combination of factors leave investors nursing losses. The technology sector has been hit by the Facebook controversy, and in the UK, the slump in Micro Focus shares following a profit warning. There is also nervousness ahead of this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, which is expected to sanction another interest rate rise. The interest will be in seeing whether new Fed chair Jerome Powell hints at three or four increases in total this year. Signs of some agreement in the Brexit transition talks has lifted the pound to a one month high against the dollar. But the strength of sterling has helped push the FTSE 100 to its lowest level since December 2016. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 121.21 points or 1.69% to 7042.93 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.39% to 12,217.02 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.13% at 5222.84 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 0.98% lower at 22,633.10 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.99% at 9664.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.79% to 807.44 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 429 points or 1.72%. The Facebook controversy means investors are shying away from risk in general, sayd Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Markets are in full retreat this afternoon, and the drop has been exemplified by a triple-digit decline on the FTSE 100. The index has returned to December 2016 levels, a remarkable change from last when it was riding high above 7200. Devoid of big macro data, investors have focused on the growing scandal at Facebook and this has resulted in a full-blown flight from risk. Investors have begun to fear that the social media giant has encountered its first real obstacle, and that further investigation will uncover other data breaches. The market has been in love with Facebook for a long time now, but with questions surrounding other tech giants and their use of data, it could be only a matter of time until others of the hitherto untouchable \u2018FANG\u2019 stocks find themselves dragged into an official investigation. Another retailer in trouble, as US jewellery and accessories group Claire\u2019s files for bankruptcy. The company said its international operations were not included but it does plan to cut back on the number of its stores in Europe. The full story is here: Meanwhile in the UK, Carpetright shares are down 17.5% and Mothercare has lost 12.5% as investors fret about store closures and future prospects for both chains. It\u2019s not getting any better for Facebook. It\u2019s shares are now down 7% in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. The technology gloom on both sides of the Atlantic, including worries about an EU tax and in the UK the slump in Micro Focus shares, is one of the reasons for the day\u2019s market weakness. On Wall Street the Nasdaq Composite is down 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 280 points or 1.1%. Investors are also nervous ahead of this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. A rate rise announcement on Wednesday is almost a done deal, but there is much nervousness about whether there will be three or four increases in total this year. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.2% and France\u2019s Cac is 0.89% lower while the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.59%, not helped by a stronger pound after positive noises from the Brexit negotiations. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: A sharp decline in tech stocks, US politcal tension between and a \u2018death cross\u2019 on Germany\u2019s benchmark DAX index were all weighing on sentiment. Investors are extra touchy in the lead up to Wednesday\u2019s FOMC meeting and the first press conference from new Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The death cross, when the 50 day moving average crosses below the two-hundred day moving average, is a technical indication that the price trend for German stocks has turned downwards. Tech stocks saw some of the biggest declines on the day. Facebook\u2019s monopoly on personal data has put the company under the microscope again. There has been public outcry over the use of personal data harvested from Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica for use in election campaigns. The latest data scandal might well be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back for tighter industry regulation. Tighter regulation of how data is collected and used will inevitably curb growth for tech and social media companies that use the data to attract advertisers. Back with Facebook, and the company could now face regulation, sayis Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank: Facebook shares are down almost 4% as the Cambridge Analytica Files were revealed over the weekend by the Guardian. The files expose a major data scandal that Facebook did little to contain or correct. This scandal will fuel into the Mueller investigation and potentially pave the way for the regulation of Facebook as the social media platform is a national security asset because people\u2019s behaviour can be impacted through the network. Garney also warns about the impact of the EU Commission considering a technology tax of 3% on revenues: This is move to make technology companies, that are extensively using transfer pricing to avoid taxes in high tax rate countries, to pay more to society. These are just the first signs that major technology companies will be more regulated in the future. It is key for long-term investors in technology to have this on the radar. On a day when markets in Europe and the US are heavily in negative territory, Barclays is one exception to the rule. The bank\u2019s shares are up nearly 4% after it emerged that activist investor Edward Bramson had taken control of a 5% stake through his Sherborne Investors. It owns 1.94% of the bank\u2019s shares directly and the rest of the 5% through derivatives. Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director, said: Sherborne has built a formidable reputation for squeezing improved financial and operational performance from the companies in which it invests and Edward Bramson clearly feels that Barclays shares are going cheap, given the prevailing discount to the book, or net asset value. The question now is what the activist investor thinks Barclays should be doing differently and how he intends to get those views across to the bank\u2019s boss, Jes Staley. The fall in Facebook\u2019s value has also hit founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal wealth. His stake in the business has fallen by around $4bn in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. But don\u2019t worry too much. He is still worth around $71bn, making him the world\u2019s fourth richest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Today\u2019s sell off has wiped some $27bn off Facebook\u2019s value, as investors react to the revelations about its relationship with Cambridge Analytica. Breaking: Shares in Facebook have fallen at the start of trading in New York, after the social media giant was hit by a major data scandal. Yesterday, the Observer reported that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested the Facebook profiles of millions of US voters, and used them to built a sophisticated tools to predict, and influence, how they would vote. The disclosure creates some huge questions for Facebook, as Cambridge Analytica worked for Donald Trump\u2019s successful election campaign. As my colleague Carole Cadwalladr reported: Christopher Wylie, who worked with a Cambridge University academic to obtain the data, told the Observer: \u201cWe exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people\u2019s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\u201d Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals. Facebook is now facing criticism from politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. There are with suggestions that founder Mark Zuckerberg could be summoned to the UK parliament to answer questions. Conservative MP Damian Collins, who chairs the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, has said he plans to recall Cambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO to explain why he told MPs last month that his company had not received data from Facebook. Collins says: \u201cWe will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments\u201d. Tech shares are also being hit by reports that Brussels is preparing to impose a digital tax on the EU revenues of companies such as Google, Facebook and Apple. Facebook is leading the selloff, falling from $185 per share to below $176 in early trading. Ding ding. The New York stock market has opened, and stocks are dropping in a broad-based selloff. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed around 100 points, or 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1%. Adam Leyland of The Grocer reckons the Conviviality crisis began after it floated on the stock market in 2013, and started executing ambitious takeover deal to consolidate the drinks trade. He point out that the company changed CFOs last autumn, and has also been hit by recent bad weather and the post-festive slump. Leyland writes: It seems incredible that a business could unravel as quickly as Conviviality has. But with tighter margins and sales commonplace after Christmas, plus tough trading and the snow to contend with, it\u2019s not inconceivable that an operation can quickly lose control of cashflow. And you lose it at your peril. The Grocer: Why has Conviviality spent out on company-owned stores? Newsflash: The CEO of Conviviality, which owns the Bargain Booze and Wine Rack chains, has resigned. Diana Hunter has stepped down with immediate effect, the company says, less than a week after the company\u2019s shares were suspended after two profits warnings. Conviviality is in a pickle. Firstly, it revealed that a spreadsheet error meant profits this year would be \u00a35.2m lower than expected. That was compounded last week when it discovered an unpaid \u00a330m tax bill. Conviviality, which is also a drinks wholesaler, is urgently seeking fresh funds from investors. Last week, Sky News reported that some were demanding Hunter\u2019s exit in return for their support. Brexit means colour-coding! The new draft Brexit deal text has been neatly shaded to show areas where there is full agreement (green), political agreement (yellow) and areas which are still under discussion (white0). It\u2019s official! Britain and the EU have taken a \u201cdecisive step\u201d towards withdrawal agreement, says Michel Barnier in Brussels. After intensive work, the two sides have jointly published a new version of the draft withdrawal deal for Brexit, says Barnier at his joint press-conference with David Davis. This includes \u201ccomplete accord\u201d on citizens right and Britain\u2019s financial settlement. But.. Barnier also cautions that a step is just a step - a lot of work remains to be done, especially on the Ireland border issue. So, they\u2019re closer, but they\u2019re not there yet. The pound is pushing a little higher, now up 0.7% against both the US dollar (to $1.405), and the euro (to \u20ac1.147). Politics Live has full details. Disappointingly, another 46 Carillion workers have been made redundant today by the Official Receiver. The receiver was unable to find fresh employment for these staff, following Carillion\u2019s fall into liquidation two months ago. This takes the total laid off to 1,582. In better news, 71 workers have been successfully transferred to a new supplier, which means 8,592 jobs have been saved - or almost half Carillion\u2019s workers. That leaves around 7,000 workers who are still working on outsourced public or private sector contracts which haven\u2019t yet been transferred to a new operator, or cancelled. The surge in the pound is helping to drag Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 down to a two-week low. Micro Focus is also doing its bit - shares are down a staggering 55% after this morning\u2019s gloomy update. This has helped wipe 90 points off the Footsie, or 1.2%. Other European markets are also starting the new week rather, er, weakly, with losses in Frankfurt (-0.9%), Paris (-0.7%), Milan (-0.4%) and Madrid (-0.5%) Investors are edgy ahead of several big news events this week, including the G20 finance ministers meeting in Buenos Aires (ending tomorrow), and Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting which is likely to lead to a hike in US interest rates. Fed chair Jerome Powell\u2019s first press conference since replacing Janet Yellen will give the markets an insight into his thinking, and the likely pace of future rate hikes. A frisson of excitement is rippling through the foreign exchange floors, amid rumours of a Brexit breakthough. Britain\u2019s Brexit secretary David David is meeting with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier now, ahead of the crunch EU summit later this week. And there are rumours that the two men will announce that the \u2018broad\u2019 terms of a transition deal have been agreed. If so, that would calm fears that Britain would crash over the cliff-edge into a hard Brexit in March 2019. The pound has gained almost a cent against the US dollar to $1.40, and is up 0.5% against the euro to \u20ac1.14 (both the highest levels since February) Barnier and Davis are due to hold a press conference at around 12.45pm Brussels time (11.45am GMT). Our Politics Live blog will have all the action (plus the latest on the Skripal poisoning). Back to GKN.... and Melrose has swiftly rubbished today\u2019s news that America\u2019s Dana will list shares in London if it succeeds in merging with GKN\u2019s auto business. A Melrose spokeswoman argues that City investors will still lose out, due to London\u2019s listing rules. \u2018A secondary UK listing will make little difference to the problems it creates for UK holders with Ohio-headquartered Dana maintaining its primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Without a primary UK listing the shares will remain outside the investment mandate of many UK funds who benchmark their performance against the UK indices. Such a listing does not allow indexation, so UK tracker funds can\u2019t hold the shares. Perhaps more significantly many of the UK listing rules which govern corporate behaviour, such as shareholder approval for significant acquisitions, do not apply to a standard listing. There will still be a major flowback issue which has implications for the underlying price the shares are offered at. Basically, it\u2019s a fudge which is unattractive to UK shareholders\u2019 In a busy morning for takeover news, UK property group Hammerson is fending off an approach from French mall operator Kl\u00e9pierre. Kl\u00e9pierre has announced this morning that it approached Hammerson about a possible \u00a35bn offer. If it went through, it would thwart Hammerson\u2019s attempt to merge with rival Intu and create Britain\u2019s biggest property firm. Hammerson has swiftly rejected Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s approach as \u201centirely opportunistic\u201d and without merit, even though the 615p per share offer is around 40% over Hammerson\u2019s value last week. Hammerson shares have jumped 25% this morning, as traders anticipate a bidding battle for the company - which owns 37 shopping centres and retail parks including Birmingham\u2019s Bullring shopping centre. More here: Reuters reckons the takeover battle for GKN is heating up today, with both sides sweetening their pitch to shareholders. They write: Melrose, making a hostile bid, said it would inject about 1 billion pounds ($1.39 billion) into GKN\u2019s pension scheme, its latest attempt to convince shareholders to back its offer and win over political opponents of the deal. Shareholders have until March 29 to decide on that offer. GKN is trying to fight off the Melrose bid with an alternative $6.1 billion deal to merge its automotive business with U.S. company Dana Incorporated leaving GKN focused on its aerospace division. Dana said on Monday it would seek a secondary listing in London, enabling more UK shareholders to back the rival plan as some funds are subject to rules which prevent them from holding US stock. The US company also promised GKN investors a slice of its dividend as it said it would pay its current quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share to the enlarged shareholder base. Bloomberg\u2019s Sam Unsted says it\u2019s turning into a full-blown saga: Over in the City, investors have been distracted from the GKN-Melrose battle by a truly grim announcement from tech firm Micro Focus. Micro Focus, a FTSE 100-listed software provider, warned that revenues will fall by between 6% and 9% this year, which will eat into profits. It blames integration problems following its \u00a36.8bn takeover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s software business last autumn, a deal that made Micro Focus Britain\u2019s biggest tech company. Micro Focus admits that it has struggled to implement its new IT system, which hit sales - leading to sales people quitting the business. Splitting HP\u2019s software operations from the rest of the business has caused further disruption to customer accounts, it admits, making it harder to win sales. Quite a mess. CEO Chris Hsu has resigned and is leaving with immediate effect to \u201cspend more time with his family and pursue another opportunity\u201d. Micro Focus insists it can fix these problems, and that the HP deal makes sense. But shareholders have reacted by wiping 50% off Micro Focus\u2019s share price. The unions who represent GKN employees across the UK will demand answers from Melrose over its plans for the company, when they meet today. Many GKN workers fear for their future, as Melrose\u2019s business model is to buy companies, make them more profitable, and then sell them again. One person\u2019s \u2018asset-stripper\u2019 is another one\u2019s \u2018turnaround specialist\u2019, of course. But unions are concerned that Melrose could load GKN up with debt, and take a dangerously short-term approach. Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary Steve Turner has warned: \u201cMelrose\u2019s bosses have been far from clear about the detail of their true intentions for GKN beyond vague platitudes and soundbites. \u201cQuestion marks remain around the levels of debt Melrose will pile on the company and what it means for jobs, long-term investment and product development. Turner also points out that aerospace giant Airbus - GKN\u2019s largest customer - has warned it couldn\u2019t work with the firm unless it knew its long-term plans. \u201cGKN\u2019s highly skilled UK workforce fear they will end up being sold off piecemeal, with their jobs either axed or shipped overseas to fund a debt-fuelled pay day if Melrose gets its way. That concern over Melrose\u2019s short-termism extends to major GKN customers such as Airbus too, which relies on a long-term relationship with GKN to develop the wings of the future. \u201cIf Airbus or other major customers take their business elsewhere it would blow a hole in revenues and destroy jobs and innovation. In another development, Melrose has lowered the \u2018Acceptance Condition\u2019 of its GKN offer, from 90% to 50% plus one share. That means it has lowered the bar to a successful takeover. GKN has hit back against Melrose\u2019s takeover bid. The UK engineering group has announced that, once it sells its Driveline business to American firm Dana, the resulting company will have a secondary listing on the London stock exchange as well as a primary listing in New York. That is designed to help GKN investors, who might have been forced to sell the shares they\u2019ll own in Dana-GKN Driveline if the deal goes through Driveline is GKN\u2019s automobile division. The \u00a34.4bn sale to Dana (who make axels and driveshafts) was hammered out 10 days ago as GKN battled to repel Melrose\u2019s advances. CEO Anne Stevens says that the deal makes sense for GKN shareholders, especially if they\u2019ll be able to hold onto equity in the new business through a London listing. \u201cSince announcing the deal to bring GKN Driveline and Dana together, I have had the opportunity to speak to many of our shareholders and explain why I am so excited about this prospect. \u201cThe complementary nature of the two businesses and our shared commitment to R&amp;D and long term investment creates a fantastic opportunity to build a world leading company and create meaningful shareholder value by delivering $235 million in synergies. \u201cThe listing on the London Stock Exchange will make it possible for more of our shareholders to participate in the expected value creation opportunity from the combined Dana and GKN Driveline business.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The battle to take control of one of Britain\u2019s oldest engineering firms is hotting up today. Melrose, the turnaround group, has intensified the pressure as it tries to seize control of GKN, in an increasingly bitter fight. Over the weekend, Melrose CEO Simon Peckham blasted GKN\u2019s management, telling the Sunday Telegraph that: \u201cGKN has been run by people who don\u2019t have an owner mentality, they have a manager mentality. \u201cIt\u2019s a business that has slowly but surely lost the support of the UK institutional investment community.\u201d Relations between the two companies were already chilly (Melrose\u2019s plan for GKN includes dismissing its management and giving its staff more involvement). Peckham\u2019s intervention, at a time when major shareholders are having to choose who to back, ensures they are now sub-zero. And this morning, Melrose has announced that it has offered to put more money into GKN\u2019s pension scheme -- roughly \u00a31bn over the time it expected to own GKN. It told the City that this proposal is almost twice the amount of the \u00a3528 million deficit reduction package that the trustees recently agreed with GKN. Melrose chairman Christopher Miller says: The proposal we have made to the trustees of up to \u00a31 billion of contributions under our ownership is a clear example of what Melrose does which is good for pensioners and shareholders alike and shows we are a good custodian for all stakeholders. Melrose\u2019s measured approach represents certainty of strategy, value and management. We strongly urge GKN shareholders to accept our offer without delay.\u201d That might assuage some concerns about whether Melrose is a suitable owner for GKN. GKN, though, insists that Melrose\u2019s latest offer (worth around \u00a38bn) is too low. MPs also have concerns, given Melrose\u2019s track record of buying companies and breaking them up to release value. Unions also fear job losses - and are expect to meet with Melrose today. Shareholders have until 29th March to make a decision.... Also coming up today.... Finance ministers from the G20 group of advanced economies are meeting in Argentina today. They\u2019ll be discussing trade, financial stability and cryptocurrencies (among other issues). The economic calendar heats up later this week, with UK inflation and unemployment data, plus interest rate decisions from the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve. However, today is quieter, apart from some eurozone trade and construction data. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone trade balance for January 10am GMT: Eurozone construction output figures for January All day: G20 finance ministers meet in Buenos Aires"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
