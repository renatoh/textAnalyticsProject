Regardless of whether he lifts the trophy on Monday, the 21-year-old Trump has been this year's star of the show. \"He's the new wonderboy the sport's been looking for,\" said Higgins in advance of what he expected to be \"as hard a final as any I've ever played\". In his flair and enterprise Trump is like Alex Higgins without his unpleasant streak of self-destruction, Jimmy White without his ill restrained and ultimately undermining hedonism and Ronnie O'Sullivan without the depressive psychological baggage which has impeded him for years. This junior prodigy made slower than expected progress on the professional circuit, encouraging wins being offset by surprising defeats. When he was 80-1 for the title, he regarded it as \"a decent achievement\" even to qualify for The Crucible for the second time but winning the China Open four weeks ago \"changed everything in my head.\" Higgins, who has stayed the distance in this annual 17-day marathon of the mind four times, winning three, led 3-2 but then it was Trump's turn. An explosive pack opener spread the balls invitingly for 102 and from another uninhibited scattering of the reds he potted eight red/blacks. Unwisely, he chose to pursue a 147 by attempting to retain black-ball position when he could have made sure of clinching the frame by rolling the cue ball through for blue. A maximum would have been a crowdpleaser and Trump likes to please but Higgins made him pay for his inappropriate ambition. Somewhat surprisingly, Higgins did not clear up in one but 42 and, after a safety duel, a clearance of the colours, put him in front again at 4-3. The Scot had a chance to steal the last frame of the afternoon as well after obtaining the snooker he needed but he failed to pot the black he required from the last red and the session ended all square. In the evening Higgins led 5-4, 45-0 but missed an easy green to middle and did not score again until Trump had clinched a 7-5 lead with a flying 103. Prior to the match Trump doubted that he\u201a \"would be able to out-safety John\" while Higgins anticipated \"wondering where to put the white because Judd just pots and pots.\" The next two frames went to Higgins, who was exuding ferocious determination and vast experience, but, though he was level again at 7-7 , his potting was uncharacteristically unreliable and, with a top break of 64 for the day, he did not score heavily enough. Trump, embodying Steve Davis's axiomatic ideal of \"to play as if it means nothing when it means everything\", accumulated a 9-7 lead, increased to 10-7 at the close after Higgins, having missed a basic black from its spot on 35-0, did not pot another ball in the last frame of the day. Like the rest of the players Trump holds Higgins in the highest respect, although he did remark the other day: \"Some of the leading players are getting that bit older and a few gaps are opening up.\" Depending on the outcome of the final he will be either 10th or ninth in the end- of-season world rankings from his start-of- season 24th. Beyond this and the \u00a3250,000 first prize, though, his life would change for ever if he could win eight of Monday's 18 frames to become, after Stephen Hendry, the second youngest champion in the event's 84-year history."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
