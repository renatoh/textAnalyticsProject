You are who you are. A leopard don\u2019t change its spots. I am what I am. I\u2019m keeping it real.\u201d Looking ahead to what he hopes will be a decade at the summit of the division to emulate Klitschko\u2019s 11-year reign, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to achieve it now but what would be better for me is to maintain it. That\u2019s what I said to Klitschko: for me this was not a defining fight. It\u2019s just part of my journey.\u201d Joshua, who says he is a \u201cnot bad\u201d tennis player, is already an unbackable 11-1 on favourite to displace Murray as the BBC\u2019s sports personality of the year, paid tribute to the Scot\u2019s longevity and hard work. \u201cHe is a really good guy, dedicated. We talked boxing [at the Rio Olympics]. I think he would have enjoyed that fight, where ever he is in the world. He\u2019s done it for a long time so he definitely does deserve the credit he receives. I think that speaks volumes. It\u2019s not just, like, arriving. And it\u2019s not just so much what you do inside, it\u2019s how you conduct [yourself] outside, because that determines whether you go back on the same level or not.\u201d Joshua\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, has been hitting the phones since Saturday night to make sense of a complicated landscape. The odds are Joshua will not fight again until October, possibly in Madison Square Garden against a lesser challenger, or at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff against the WBC champion, Deontay Wilder \u2013 or even the still-suspended former champion, Tyson Fury, who is Joshua\u2019s preferred option and who claimed on Monday: \u201cI can beat AJ with one arm tied behind my back. I don\u2019t even need a warm-up.\u201d It could be a rematch against Klitschko \u2013 although Joshua thinks the Ukrainian\u2019s elder brother, Vitali, and his partner, the American actress Hayden Panettiere, will counsel against his continuing in the sport at 41 after taking a heavy beating in the 11th and final round. Hearn, clarified the remaining options (none of which will be nailed down for at least a month): \u201c[Joseph] Parker [who defends his WBO title against the obscure Razvan Cojanu in New Zealand on 6 May] is an interesting pawn in this because he\u2019s looking for that big fight. Parker might fight Wilder and he may fight [David Haye\u2019s recent conqueror, Tony] Bellew. Bellew\u2019s not a future opponent for Josh.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
