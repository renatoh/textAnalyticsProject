The Telegraph through its parent company, Nationwide News, began its appeal on Monday against the federal court justice Michael Wigney\u2019s ruling that the Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper had defamed Rush by alleging he \u201cengaged in inappropriate behaviour\u201d during a Sydney Theatre Company production of King Lear in 2015. The first day of a two-day trial ended on a dramatic note, when in an 11th-hour change of heart the newspaper dropped its claim that Wigney\u2019s conduct in the case \u201cgave rise to an apprehension of bias\u201d. The last-minute decision to drop the claim drew an angry response from Rush\u2019s barrister, Bret Walker SC, who told the court the Telegraph\u2019s \u201cvery grave\u201d allegation of bias had been \u201ca slur both on the trial judge and on the cogency of the vindication our client has enjoyed\u201d. But the Telegraph is still arguing Wigney erred both in finding that the newspaper\u2019s star witness, Eryn Jean Norvill, gave unreliable evidence and in awarding special damages to Rush based on an \u201cinference\u201d the actor would no longer be able to work. If the appeal is unsuccessful, Rush is due to receive $2.9m in damages \u2013 the largest defamation payout to a single person in Australia \u2013 including just under $2m in special damages, $850,000 in general damages to compensate for loss of reputation and hurt feelings, and $42,000 interest. In written submissions, the newspaper has also argued the general damages awarded to Rush were \u201cmanifestly excessive\u201d and pointed to a New South Wales supreme court decision to award the West Indies cricketer Chris Gayle $300,000 after a jury found a series of articles published by Fairfax Media in 2016 which alleged he exposed his penis to a masseuse were untrue. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The two cases, the Telegraph argues, had \u201cseveral significant similarities\u201d including that both Rush and Gayle were \u201cwell known internationally in their respective fields\u201d, and \u201ccritically, the imputations all relate to the same kind of imputations, namely sexual impropriety towards a woman in the workplace\u201d. \u201cThe key differences are that in the Gayle case there were more publications (28 versus three) and in the Gayle case there was no award for aggravated damages,\u201d the Telegraph\u2019s lawyers wrote in their submissions to the appeal court. \u201cIt is difficult to see how the matters of aggravation found by the primary judge in this case resulted in a damages award $550,000 higher than Mr Gayle\u2019s award given the similarities in the cases,\u201d they wrote. On Monday the Telegraph\u2019s barrister, Tom Blackburn SC, told the court that Rush\u2019s damages for economic loss were \u201csubstantial\u201d and based on a belief that he couldn\u2019t work, which was \u201ccobbled together with speculation and inferences\u201d. The decision to award them, he said, was \u201cextraordinary and absurd\u201d because while the actor had \u201cdelivered his lines\u201d over three days in the witness box, he had never told the court he had not received offers to work. \u201cHere\u2019s one thing he didn\u2019t say, that is, \u2018I am unable to work because of these articles.\u2019 He just didn\u2019t say it,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cNeither did he say I have received no or fewer offers because of these articles. His American agent, Fred Specktor, did not say he has received no or fewer offers because of these articles, his Australian agent wasn\u2019t called, no one gave that evidence.\u201d Blackburn said the \u201cfailure\u201d to ask Rush that question was \u201cnot explicable on any other conceivable basis other than that it was a deliberate decision\u201d. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t clearly come out and say \u2018I have received no offers of work\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWe say it is very strange for the court to be having to draw inferences about his state of mind.\u201d The trial continues on Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
