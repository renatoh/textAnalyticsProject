He should know - he's a tax inspector. The Parliamentary ombudsman and Citizens Advice agree with our reader. This week they gave the government a drubbing in two separate reports detailing how low income families have been overpaid tax credits, often following a computer error, and then harassed to return the money. Now pressure is building for ministers to admit that payments made following computer and staff inputting errors should be written off along with cases where low income families face hardship if the are forced to pay the money back. But many families remain confused about how the Inland Revenue, now part of Revenue &amp; Customs, calculates tax credit awards and how to appeal when it makes mistakes. Award notices remain a mystery to all but a few eggheads in the Revenue, so it is hard to spot mistakes. But anyone who changes their circumstances in a way that affects their income is vulnerable. Caroline Dixon of Sunderland can trace her problems with the Revenue to last year when she split from her husband. Other readers have found that jobs with short-term contracts trigger instant claims for backdated tax credits, plunging them into debt. Moving house, having more children and getting a promotion can all send the system into a spin. Advisers say anyone who depends on tax credits needs to be watchful of changes and keep records of all correspondence and phone calls. If you think you can trust the Revenue, think again. So what can victims do to get redress? Ann Abraham, the parliamentary ombudsman, says errors by Revenue staff can form the basis of an appeal to keep cash you honestly believed was rightly yours. Treasury minister Dawn Primarolo has hinted that she may tell the Revenue to write off all overpayments that result from official error. So send in a complaint form and keep the up the political pressure. Write a letter to your MP and copy it to Ms Primarolo telling them how you were defeated by the system. What else can you do? If you haven't complained to the Revenue get a copy of the complaint form from the Revenue &amp; Customs website (hmrc.gov.uk) and send it off. You can only appeal to the Inland Revenue ombudsman once the Revenue has rejected your complaint. The Adjudicator published its annual report earlier this week and said it upheld 86% of complaints refused by the Revenue. Adjudicator Barbara Mills echoed criticism from the parliamentary ombudsman and Citizens Advice, saying often the advice given to claimants was \"plain wrong\". Another reader contacted Jobs &amp; Money this week to say she was a victim of bad advice. She has been paying back \u00a380 a month for over a year following overpayments totalling \u00a34,000. Nicola Sayer of Bude, Cornwall, was told she should have noticed from her tax credit award that vital information was wrong. She says she phoned the tax credit helpline to question the figures but was told they were correct. The Revenue denied her version of events until she produced phone bills showing the time and duration of calls to the helpline. In response the Revenue claimed that call time was too short to appear on its records. It was also too short to access helpline staff at a time when staff were taking up to half an hour to answer calls. In other words the system was in such a parlous state there was no way she could have been given advice in the time she spent making calls. The tax inspector who contacted us this week was himself a tax credit claimant. He has asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing his job. He lost his tax credit and has been told he owes hundreds of pounds. \"I really dread to think of the turmoil 'lay' people must be experiencing,\" he says. To make a complaint ask for form Cop1 at your local tax office, hmrc.gov.uk or call 0845 9000404 and the Revenue will send you a copy. For independent information there is a Citizens Advice fact sheet, available under \"what's new\" on the website adviceguide.org.uk How J&amp;M tracked the chaos The Guardian was the first newspaper to reveal the tax credit system was in trouble and Jobs &amp; Money has campaigned tirelessly for two years for the Inland Revenue officials to take a more lenient stance on repayments. Last year, under the headline \"Don't make it easy for the taxman\" we told how Citizens Advice was advising claimants to check their records before agreeing to make overpayments. Given the official reports detailing how Inland Revenue systems make thousands of errors a month, it turned out be sound advice. In the spring we offered further tips on how to appeal if the Revenue had begun to claw back overpayments (\"Tax credit victims in fightback\") and reported on calls by MPs for ministers to tackle the \"tax credit shambles\". It would be a further two months before Dawn Primarolo, the minister in charge would concede to conducting a limited review. Calls for her resignation this week were rebuffed by the government. The government has resisted calls for an overhaul of the tax credits system ever since it was launched in 2003 amid chaos and confusion. Ms Primarolo ordered a limited review last month, but this week's critical reports have failed to persuade her the system is flawed. She has also ignored calls by charities representing low income families, MPs and civil service unions, which have campaigned for a moratorium on demands for tax credits to be repaid until basic defects in the system are investigated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
