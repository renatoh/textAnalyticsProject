The Liverpool manager is on a shortlist of possible successors drawn up by the FA as part of their contingency plan in the event of the Swede's departure. News that Eriksson had met the Chelsea chief executive, Peter Kenyon, last Thursday has surprised the FA but they are not panicking. Mark Palios, the FA's chief executive, continues to believe that Eriksson - who watched Charlton play Aston Villa yesterday - will remain in the job and sign the new contract on offer that would extend his tenure to 2008. That looks unlikely. Sources in Madrid say that the Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is keen to recruit Eriksson, no matter how much Carlos Queiroz achieves at the Bernabeu this season. It is an exact echo of Claudio Ranieri's situation at Chelsea, who clearly also want to woo Eriksson. Ranieri, according to a senior figure at Stamford Bridge, will end up at Tottenham. Eriksson has thus worked himself into an enviable position: in demand by two of Europe's top, and most liberal-spending clubs. He is also sought by Inter Milan, and can expect a grilling when he faces the press this week ahead of England's friendly in Sweden. The FA, though continuing to insist that Eriksson remains committed to his job, have always had a plan B. They have let it be known that the new man, if needed this summer, must have a detailed and lengthy working knowledge of English football. Among the names not being considered are Ottmar Hitzfeld, the outgoing Bayern Munich manager, Roma's Fabio Capello - who wants to work in England - and Giovanni Trapattoni, the Italy national coach. Among the few English candidates being considered are Middlesbrough's Steve McClaren, who has considerable experience of the national team set-up having worked with Eriksson, and Charlton's Alan Curbishley. Houllier is far more experienced than the English contenders and has impressive credentials. As technical director of French football, he was the power behind the throne for a decade, culminating in the World Cup win of 1998. He also had a spell as national team coach during that time. With his position at Liverpool apparently less secure, it is a job that could tempt Houllier, who has a year left on his contract at Anfield but conceded in the wake of Liverpool's Uefa Cup exit at Marseille last week that, while he expected to carry on next season, the decision could be taken out of his hands. He is aware that much depends on Liverpool achieving a Champions League place this season but wants to continue working in football, whatever his future at Anfield. Eriksson can expect a considerable backlash if he has been talking to Chelsea about taking over at Stamford Bridge or - more likely - playing them off against Real. He would find it very difficult to work in peace in this country, and the way he has conducted himself could even count against Houllier. The Liverpool manager has always been an Anglophile and loves both this country and its football. His has admirable international credentials and he believes the current England generation has a serious chance of winning the World Cup of 2006. If Houllier does move this summer, it will be part of a managerial merry-go-round, with jobs likely to be on offer also at Celtic, where Martin O'Neill is expected to move on, Chelsea, Tottenham, Real Madrid, and maybe Inter and Roma. With top managers more important these days, the focus is as much on them as player transfers. It is becoming more evident that the Real job is the one that really interests Eriksson, who can expect renewed calls for him to leave now. It is not that simple or practical in the modern game. Even Bobby Robson, whose patriotism could never be questioned, was negotiating in 1990 a move to PSV Eindhoven before leading England to the World Cup semi-finals. He had had eight years in the job, though, and both the FA and Robson knew it was time for a change. Nor did he do anything to undermine England's preparations for a major tournament. France, the favourites for Euro 2004, are in a similar situation with their coach, Jacques Santini, whose contract expires after the tournament. If Eriksson makes clear his intention to leave, the FA can get on with activating their shortlist, perhaps talking to Houllier and Liverpool come season's end. Should the dust not settle, however, Eriksson's position could become untenable, and Trevor Brooking could become caretaker. The FA made no official response before Eriksson took his seat at The Valley yesterday. Eriksson has always been good for England, as his record shows. His more thoughtful and tactical approach - found wanting only against Brazil in the second half of the World Cup match quarter-final of two years ago - has brought memorable moments, such as the 5-1 win over Germany in Munich, and the best out of many players, who would be sorry to see him go. It was just what England needed after the Kevin Keegan years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
