The Methodist conference in Birmingham is being urged to support proposals to allow same-sex marriage in its chapels. If successful, a final decision would be taken next year after wider consultation. Among the Christian denominations in the UK that allow same-sex marriages are the Quakers, the Scottish Episcopal church, the United Reformed church and the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches. The Church of England has restated traditional doctrine that marriage is a union between a man and a woman. The Methodist church \u2013 Britain\u2019s fourth largest Christian denomination after the C of E, the Roman Catholic church and the Church of Scotland \u2013 set up a task group in 2016 to consider its definition of marriage in the light of legal and social changes. A report from the group to be presented to the conference this week highlights \u201cthe hurt felt by those who perceive that the current definition implies they are \u2018lesser persons\u2019 \u201d. At the same time, it says, feelings of \u201calienation and distress\u201d among those adhering to a traditional definition of marriage should be acknowledged. It concludes that the church should \u201cvalue all committed faithful loving relationships\u201d and offer dignity and inclusion \u201cto those who cohabit, are single, or are developing relationships, irrespective of sexuality and gender\u201d. It proposes \u201cwe take steps to enable same-sex couples to get married in the Methodist church\u201d. A clause would exempt ministers who felt prevented by their \u201cpersonal beliefs and integrity\u201d from officiating at same-sex weddings. Methodist evangelicals opposed to the move called on Christians around the world to join a day of prayer and fasting last week aimed at upholding \u201cthe biblical understanding of marriage as the lifelong union of one man and one woman\u201d. Two years ago, the Scottish Episcopal church voted overwhelmingly to allow same-sex couples to marry in church. It was later sanctioned by the global Anglican communion over its decision. C of E leaders have striven to reconcile those who want it to be more inclusive to LGBT Christians and allow same-sex marriage, and those who want to uphold traditional biblical teaching. It has set up a string of working groups to examine the issues. The vote at the Methodist conference comes just days before the Church of England\u2019s governing body, the general synod, is to debate controversial steps towards closer ties between the two denominations. A proposal to allow \u201cinterchangeability\u201d of ministers is seen by some as a move towards reunification of the two churches, which split in the 18th century. The synod is being asked to pass an \u201cenabling measure\u201d to allow legislation to be drawn up. However, opposition on theological grounds is likely to be voiced, and some members of the synod will resist closer ties with a church likely to allow same-sex marriage. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 July 2019 to clarify that more than three Christian denominations in the UK allow same-sex marriages."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
