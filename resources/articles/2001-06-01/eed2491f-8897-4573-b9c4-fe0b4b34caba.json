So does Jonathan Gee, the brilliant postbop pianist who is partnering him on a short UK tour this week. Brown and Gee are joined in a fine international quartet by an Israeli rhythm section featuring Yorai Oron on bass and New York-based Yaaki Levy on drums. Brown is a jazz buff but with no perceptible anorak. When he announces his engagingly hard-boppish, melodically inquisitive mid-tempo groover Harold's Souk, he declares, \"This is for Harold Land, a fantastic tenor player who worked with Clifford Brown\". In that short statement lies a wealth of information about Brown's affections for shapely improvisation, thoughtful spontaneity without bop's more manic aspect, elegant tone, and the residing of the message in the spaces as well as the sounds. Brown has a bright, gleaming tone, a superbly poised attack, and a fine rhythmic sense that paces high long notes, stuttery phrases, pauses and sudden foot-on-the-gas accelerations against each other in eloquent conjunction. The repertoire mostly spans a style of jazz that began in the mid-1950s with Miles Davis's Workin' and Steamin' discs and the Clifford Brown/Max Roach band, and runs up to the eloquent, emphatic Latin-flavoured modal music of 1970s' McCoy Tyner. But it isn't a history lesson, or a timid cloning operation - Brown and Gee are far more free-spirited improvisers than that, and Oron and Levy maintain an urgent crackle and snap behind them. The pieces they play - mostly originals by the co-leaders - are an absorbing confection of mixed-tempo themes (surging four-four swingers drifting into ruminative counter-themes and back), warm lyrical works that break into trots and then turn smoky again, and fast groovers that bring out the best in both leaders. Particularly notable is Gee's originality of phrasing and shrewd sense of when to crank up the intensity with flag-waving devices such as McCoy Tyner's jostling, percussive chords. This may be a legacy band, but it is a very inventive one. \u0095 Damon Brown and Jon Gee play the Band on the Wall, Manchester (0161-833 0682) tonight, then tour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
