Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, told reporters: \u201cWe will immediately proceed to inform Bolivia\u2019s foreign ministry that under international law, it should offer safe conduct [to Morales].\u201d Mexico had \u201cdecided to grant political asylum to Evo Morales in virtue of the urgent situation which he faces in Bolivia where his life and safety are at risk\u201d, Ebrard added. The minister confirmed that Morales had accepted the asylum offer. The president\u2019s exit has created chaos and uncertainty in Bolivia as well as stoking fears about a power vacuum. Looting, vandalism and arson carried out by both his supporters and opponents have been already been reported. Morales\u2019 decision to step down followed several quick-fire developments on Sunday, beginning with the release of a report by the Organization of American States (OAS) that said it had found \u201cclear manipulations\u201d of the voting system in last month\u2019s presidential election and could not verify the first-round victory for Morales. The president responded by saying he would call fresh elections but stepped down after the head of the army publicly called for him to leave his post. On Monday, Morales used social media to accuse the opposition leaders Carlos Mesa and Luis Fernando Camacho of instigating a coup against him. \u201c[They] lie and try to blame us for the chaos and violence that they provoked,\u201d he said. The news brought mixed reactions around the world. Donald Trump welcomed it as \u201ca significant moment for democracy in the Western Hemisphere\u201d. The US president said in a written statement: \u201cAfter nearly 14 years and his recent attempt to override the Bolivian constitution and the will of the people, Morales\u2019s departure preserves democracy and paves the way for the Bolivian people to have their voices heard. \u201cThe United States applauds the Bolivian people for demanding freedom and the Bolivian military for abiding by its oath to protect not just a single person, but Bolivia\u2019s constitution.\u201d Morales, Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous leader, is an iconic figure for the international left and was the last survivor of Latin America\u2019s \u201cpink tide\u201d of two decades ago. But the country has been roiled by mass protests since last month\u2019s disputed election result. In Mexico Ebrard issued a statement on Monday defining what had happened as a \u201cmilitary coup\u201d, and calling for an urgent meeting of the OAS. \u201cWhat happened yesterday [in Bolivia] is a step backwards for the whole continent,\u201d he said. \u201cMilitary coups never bring anything positive and that is why we are worried.\u201d Mesa, Morales\u2019 closest rival in October\u2019s disputed election, said the president was brought down by a popular uprising, not the military. He said the military had made a decision not to deploy in the streets because \u201cthey didn\u2019t want to take lives\u201d. In Bolivia the immediate concern was the void left as resignations by Morales and his vice-president, \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Linares, were followed by the next in line, the senate president, Adriana Salvatierra. Her deputy, Jeanine A\u00f1ez, is expected to assume the interim presidency. In a wave of resignations, parliamentarians, local politicians and top brass in the army and police also stepped down. \u201cWe are living in chaos with no one assuming the reins of power, said Carlos Cordero, a political scientist at La Paz\u2019s San Andr\u00e9s university. He said no clear timeline had emerged for scheduling a fresh vote. A senior US state department official said a copy of Morales\u2019s resignation letter was circulating: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to determine if that is a valid document or something else that somebody fabricated, but we have seen a draft that has been signed.\u201d Giving Washington\u2019s view, a senior US official said: \u201cOur understanding is that what happens in fact is that people serving in public security forces and the police declined to repress the protests and later that members of the armed forces declined to repress these protests. \u201cAnd at that point Evo Morales resigned when leaders of the security forces pointed out the obvious: he had lost the faith of the public, and that the security situation had become especially grave.\u201d Commenting on the wave of resignations, the official said. \u201cThere is still a constitutional structure and therefore a clear line in the constitution for creating a legitimate succession of authority \u2026 if there is a vacuum of power, there are people who clearly have it within their reach to help reestablish a legitimate structure of governance.\u201d Another senior US official said he expected the legislative assembly to meet later on Monday or on Tuesday, and that talks were ongoing to ensure enough politicians are present to form a quorum. \u201cWe certainly hope that all members of the assembly participate fully,\u201d the official said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s important to say that they have the absolute right to participate fully in the political debates that their country is facing without hindrance, without threats, without violence and that they deserve protection.\u201d On the question of who should be able to stand in new elections, the same US official said: \u201cOur position is that people who are directly implicated in trying to distort the outcome of the elections should not participate in the follow-on election \u2026 That\u2019s not a statement about any political party.\u201d The US state department issued a statement calling for the OAS to send a mission to Bolivia to oversee the electoral process. \u201cThe Bolivian people deserve free and fair elections,\u201d it said. Social media fuelled competing claims of arson attacks or death threats against both sides after Morales\u2019 resignation. Armed intruders broke into Morales\u2019 home in Cochabamba and he accused \u201ccoup plotters\u2019 of an arson attack on his sister\u2019s home and of making death threats against his ministers and their children. Spain\u2019s foreign ministry criticised the role of Bolivia\u2019s police and army in the resignation and urged \u201call actors to avoid resorting to violence\u201d and \u201cguarantee the safety of all Bolivians \u2026 including former president Morales himself, his relatives and members of his administration\u201d. Amid claims of a witch-hunt, the head of Bolivia\u2019s supreme electoral tribunal, Mar\u00eda Eugenia Choque, stepped down after the release of the OAS report. The attorney general\u2019s office said it would investigate the tribunal\u2019s judges for possible fraud, and police later said Choque had been detained along with 37 other officials on suspicion of electoral crimes. Local media later quoted her as saying: \u201cI have been the prisoner of imposed decisions.\u201d On Monday a tense calm returned to La Paz after weeks of street protests. Gone were the crowds chanting: \u201cThis is not Cuba, nor Venezuela. This is Bolivia, and Bolivia is respected.\u201d One resident, Carlos Jim\u00e9nez, 50, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty \u2026 The people are divided but most of us think the president abused his power. [He] has to accept the people don\u2019t want him any more.\u201d Bolivia\u2019s state news agency, ABI, said Morales announced his resignation from Chapare province, where he began his political career as a union leader. He said he was returning there. \u201cI return to my people who never left me. The fight goes on,\u201d he said. However, the Democratic congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, alleged that the events in Bolivia amounted to a coup. \u201cThe people of Bolivia deserve free, fair, and peaceful elections \u2013 not violent seizures of power,\u201d she tweeted.
