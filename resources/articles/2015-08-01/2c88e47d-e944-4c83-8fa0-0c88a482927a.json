He deserved it, I think: he played well in the first and the third, and Djokovic, although he showed flashes, probably wasn\u2019t at his best. Great final, though: maybe a prequel of the upcoming US Open final? Thanks for reading: I appreciate it. Good night. What a match. What a finish! Andy Murray snaps his unbeaten record against Djokovic. Well played! Djokovic 4-6 6-4 3-6 Murray He deserves this, does Murray: he\u2019s come back brilliantly in this third set. 15-0, but then he misses a straightforward forehand, and it\u2019s 15-15. This is now about mental strength. Murray nets. 15-30. Is it unravelling? And that is absurd: Murray had all the time in the world to put away a forehand smash, and he couldn\u2019t. 15-40. Amazing. Two break points for Djokovic. Murray saves one, and then produces a quite brilliant serve down the middle. Djokovic\u2019s return is long. Deuce. And an ace from Murray! What a time to find one. Another championship point! Can he do it this time? No! What a whipped forehand winner from Djokovic! \u201cOh come on!\u201d yells Chris Fowler on commentary. Back to deuce! Next up, Djokovic is long, and it\u2019s a fifth match point. Just end this already! And he does! Murray wins! Djokovic 4-6 6-4 3-5 Murray* (*denotes next server) He\u2019s so close to ending his barren run, Murray, but Djokovic isn\u2019t going to let him have it easy: the Serb moves to 30-15. But then he moves in, chip-and-charge style, and Murray passes him easily. 30-30. And that\u2019s long on a Djokovic second serve! Murray has championship point! Can he do it?? No \u2013 because Djokovic\u2019s first serve is awesome, and Murray\u2019s return floats long. Djokovic is long again! Second match point! But now Murray is long. We\u2019re back to deuce. Beautiful return from Murray: he\u2019s up for this, and he wants to win it now. Third chance. No! Misses the backhand. And then he\u2019s too eager for the forehand! He\u2019s getting tight. Advantage Djokovic. Hold Djokovic. Murray knows: he should have won the match at that visit. *Djokovic 4-6 6-4 2-5 Murray (*denotes next server) Murray just needs to get through this game. He\u2019s off to a good start for 15-0, and then Djokovic tries to force a backhand winner, and is wide. Great serve, there: 133mph, and that\u2019s his biggest of the match. 40-0 \u2013 and that\u2019s the game. Such an efficient hold. Great tennis. Djokovic 4-6 6-4 2-4 Murray* (*denotes next server) Djokovic makes his overhead this time. And again! Djokovic isn\u2019t always the most reliable when it comes to the overhead smash, but he made two goodies just there. It\u2019s 40-15, and Murray comes to the net, but Djokovic\u2019s passing shot is too firm. Djokovic hold. That really was an amazing game. Murray did so well, but I can\u2019t believe Djokovic didn\u2019t break him. Seven chances spurned! The players are having a long, and deserved, break. *Djokovic 4-6 6-4 1-4 Murray (*denotes next server) Murray really needs to hold here, and he\u2019s up 30-0 after two fine points where he really looked to be in control. He\u2019s long next point, needlessly, but that\u2019s an excellent booming serve, and no negative chirps or impulses, it seems. 40-15. What a service return from Djokovic, though, and another blistering forehand brings it back to deuce. This is tense! That\u2019s a brilliant flipped backhand from Murray, though, and he has the advantage, but Djokovic scratches it off with a lovely soft drop shot with Murray nowhere. Deuce again! Long from Murray! That was wild. But a kick serve sets up a down-the-line winner, and we\u2019re at a third deuce. Another bad miss! Djokovic with another break, but his lob is just long. Deuce for a fourth time! This time Murray gets the advantage \u2026 but he can\u2019t make it count! Fifth deuce! Phew. This is so nervy. Double fault Murray! Can you believe it? What a battle this is. Murray refuses to give in, and we\u2019re back at deuce. Ten and a half minutes for the game so far. Now Murray is in a fight with the umpire about whether or not he bumped into the TV cameraman. That was dumb from Fergus Murphy \u2013 Murray barely did anything. Murray gets it back to deuce, but his backhand down the line is long \u2026 and Djokovic has a chance to break again! This is so to and fro. We\u2019re at an eighth deuce. Now a sixth break point for Djokovic! Murray saves again! What happens if this game never ends? Game point Murray, but he can\u2019t do it. A 10th deuce. This is epic. Murray wins the game! What a marathon. Eighteen minutes, seven break points survived, and Murray has a 4-1 lead. Phew. Djokovic 4-6 6-4 1-3 Murray* (*denotes next server) What a miss! Djokovic moved Murray all around the court, but his overhead was appalling, and into the net. Then he\u2019s long! 0-30, and Murray has a real chance. Djokovic has gone right off the boil. It\u2019s back at 30-30, though: Murray was a little tentative on that last point. 40-30 after Murray nets, and then Murray is long. Djokovic on the scoreboard. *Djokovic 4-6 6-4 0-3 Murray (*denotes next server) The TV pundits are reflecting on Murray\u2019s positive body language. But he floats one long to give Djokovic the impetus, and then Djokovic kicks the ball away angrily after he finds the net. 15-15. And what a get! Djokovic\u2019s crosscourt forehand looked like a certain winner, but Murray picked it up and put it away: so deft and sure. Top-notch, and Djokovic applauds. Now 40-15, after another beautifully constructed point. Murray looks like he\u2019s enjoying this! And that\u2019s the game! Djokovic 4-6 6-4 0-2 Murray* (*denotes next server) Ooh, that was right on the line from Djokovic, and it\u2019s 15-15 rather than 0-30. Mere inches. But then he tosses in a double fault \u2026 ha! And follows it up with an ace. 30-30. The wind has got up, according to Brad Gilbert: gusting up to about 19mph. And now Murray with a break! Can he take it? No! He misses his volley! He has Djokovic scrambling, but just couldn\u2019t execute the backhand volley. Deuce. Good response, and a second break point \u2026 which he takes! Murray is happy! *Djokovic 4-6 6-4 0-1 Murray (*denotes next server) Murray starts with a double fault, which doesn\u2019t bode well, but produces a slice of magic to drop a volley that Djokovic can\u2019t reach after a 25-ball rally. Great play, but Murray looks beat. \u201cBoth players sucking air,\u201d says Darren Cahill. 30-15, but a slice of bad luck for Murray there after his forehand clipped the tape. And that\u2019s unbelievable from Djokovic! A beautiful touch lob, and it\u2019s break point! Saved by Murray. Deuce. And Murray holds! That was so important. Both players have left the court with their bags for a \u201cgear break\u201d. Back soon. Djokovic 4-6 6-4 0-0 Murray* (*denotes next server) Superb touch from Djokovic, and Murray did really well to reach the drop shot, but it\u2019s easily put away, and three set points. Murray saves one with an excellent cross-court backhand winner, but not the next. Djokovic levels. Who\u2019s in charge now? *Djokovic 4-6 5-4 Murray (*denotes next server) Wow, that was quick. Murray with a solid hold to love, and he at least makes Djokovic have to serve for this second set. Here\u2019s Jan with some great analysis: \u201cAn interesting stat for you. Nine previous Murray-Djokovic matches have gone to one set all. The record in those? Djokovic leads 9-0! This includes best of three and best of five matches. It is 5-0 in three setters. And even 4-0 in five setters, despite the theoretical chance of coming back from two sets to one down. \u201cIn all 8 of Murray\u2019s wins, he won the first two sets, six times taking a straight sets non-Slam/Davis Cup match, and even the two Slam wins, leading 2-0 in the 2012 U.S. Open final, being pegged back to 2-2 but then winning 3-2. And the 2013 Wimbledon Final, which was straight sets. \u201cSo this second set is rather important to Murray\u2019s chances.\u201d Djokovic 4-6 5-3 Murray* (*denotes next server) It\u2019s so difficult to say who\u2019s got the momentum. I guess Djokovic, and that\u2019s a perfect pickup at the net that prompts a \u201cwow\u201d from Darren Cahill on commentary. Murray\u2019s back at 15-15, though, and now 15-30, but Djokovic comes up with a big first serve there: 30-30. He\u2019s pumped, and he\u2019s a game away from levelling the match. *Djokovic 4-6 4-3 Murray (*denotes next server) That\u2019s really aggressive from Murray, and he needs to maintain this: he\u2019s 0-8 in games against Djokovic, and this is a chance to snap that losing streak. But that\u2019s a poor shot choice from Murray, tossing in a drop shot that just wasn\u2019t on. 15-30. And now 15-40! Djokovic ups the intensity, and here\u2019s a chance to break right back. Missed! And a howl from the Serb. But it doesn\u2019t matter: Murray nets, and Djokovic is a break up again! Djokovic 4-6 3-3 Murray* (*denotes next server) Djokovic in a spot of bother at 15-30 after a missed drop shot that he should have made. And now 15-40! Double break point! Murray suddenly with a real sniff. Djokovic decides it\u2019s time for a racquet change, and it does him good: he saves the first, and then fires a serve that Murray does well to even reach. Deuce. Murray just two of 12 break point chances converted. But Djokovic yelps in anguish after missing a regulation forehand. Third break point for Murray. Saved again! Djokovic just won\u2019t lie down. But once again he\u2019s beaten for pace from Murray\u2019s groundstrokes, and it\u2019s a fourth chance, and he takes it! Murray breaks! *Djokovic 4-6 3-2 Murray (*denotes next server) Lovely clean winner to start from Murray, and then Djokovic can only find the net. 30-0. I think Murray is trying to shorten these points. 40-0 now! A serve-and-volley, and then Djokovic catches the top of the net, and it\u2019s Murray\u2019s point. Things are quickening up here. Djokovic 4-6 3-1 Murray* (*denotes next server) Better from Murray, and a perfectly placed backhand volley for 0-15. Djokovic takes advantage of a Murray mishit, though, and it\u2019s 30-15, and now 40-15: some lovely power hitting from the Serb. And an ace to finish. Well played. *Djokovic 4-6 2-1 Murray (*denotes next server) Murray is on the board! 15-0, 30-0, 40-0 \u2013 we\u2019re really rattling through this second set. I guess the players don\u2019t want to be out here too long in this heat. Lovely flipped backhand, down low, from Djokovic, and it\u2019s 40-30. Now deuce, after Murray can only find the net. This is worrying for Murray. But he finds something for the advantage, and then seemed to stop: he thought the ball from Djokovic was long. It wasn\u2019t. Deuce again. Murray nudges back head, and then finished it with an ace: his fourth. Important hold. Djokovic 4-6 2-0 Murray* (*denotes next server) Djokovic has won six straight points in this second set. Maybe it\u2019s the fact he\u2019s wearing a cap. Now 40-0 after Murray misses a forehand down the line. And that\u2019s a great winner from Djokovic to round out the game. Two games in this second set, and Murray hasn\u2019t won a point. *Djokovic 4-6 1-0 Murray (*denotes next server) I know we keep mentioning this, but to think that Murray\u2019s last victory over Djokovic was the Wimbledon final in 2013 \u2026 crazy. We\u2019ve been playing for 1hr 11min. I\u2019m already fatigued. And this is trouble for Murray: Djokovic is all over him here, and it\u2019s 0-40 in no time. And then a speculative challenge turns out to be a good one: Djokovic breaks in the first game of the second set! Djokovic 4-6 0-0 Murray* (*denotes next server) It\u2019s windy out there, and it\u2019s having an effect. Nice play from Murray, though, bringing Djokovic to the net and flicking a backhand for a clear winner. Djokovic is into the net, and this is two set points! Bjorkman grimaces. Murray has to make this count. But that\u2019s a stellar serve from Djokovic. Unreturnable. 30-40. But that\u2019s a mishit from Djokovic, and Murray wins the first set! *Djokovic 4-5 Murray (*denotes next server) Djokovic looks as though he\u2019s moving through the gears here, but Murray is on it: he wins a trio of cheap points for 40-15. Djokovic makes it 40-30, and then a funny moment: Murray was annoyed that his service was called long by the umpire Fergus Murphy, and complained, but Murphy was absolutely insistent that his call was right. \u201cYou can do what you like, but it was definitely long,\u201d Murphy said. So Murray accepted the call, but the replay showed the serve was good! Now Djokovic has a break! He couldn\u2019t sneak a lead, could he? Murray pulls out an amazing second serve that just clipped the line: he went all out and got his reward. Deuce. Now advantage Murray, and he closes it out. That\u2019s a crucial hold for him: he pumps his fist. Djokovic 4-4 Murray* (*denotes next server) Murray must be so cranky: at 4-1, he had all those chances, which he passed up, and suddenly Djokovic is back in the match. He took his opportunity; Murray didn\u2019t. There\u2019s my hot take. But Murray is on it here, and that\u2019s 15-30, and a chance. Novak closes the door, though: nice passing winner down the line. 30-30. An overrule on a tight line call gives him 40-30, but Murray gets the better of a baseline rally and it\u2019s deuce. So many deuces today. But Djokovic has too much, and we\u2019re level at four-all. *Djokovic 3-4 Murray (*denotes next server) We\u2019re looking at Jonas Bjorkman in the box. He looks good for 43! Formidable winner from Murray for 15-0, and then Djokovic totally fluffs an easy volley. 30-0! What is wrong with Djokovic? But that\u2019s a bad miss from Murray: again, much too fierce, and it\u2019s long, and we\u2019re at 30-30. This is an important point for Murray, and he wins it, set up by a fine kick serve out wide. But that\u2019s an excellent, back-and-forth point, with lobs and drop shots and net play, and Djokovic wins it. Deuce. What a return from Djokovic! A fizzing backhand, and it sets up his first break point of the match. Which he wins! Djokovic breaks back. Amazing. Djokovic 2-4 Murray* (*denotes next server) Just watching a commercial for business cards, which I think gives more credence to business cards than business cards really deserve. Modern life, eh? \u201cMurray\u2019s on fire with the backhand,\u201d says Chris Fowler on commentary, and it\u2019s 0-15. And now 0-30! Murray is sniffing an opening here, but that\u2019s more like it from Djokovic, crunching a winner for 15-30. Djokovic has been flat so far, and that\u2019s long! Just an easy forehand that he missed. Double break point! First serve is out wide, and Murray does enough to get a racquet on it, but Djokovic puts him away. 30-40. And now Djokovic goes down the middle, and Murray\u2019s return is tame. Deuce. Murray looks confident from the back of the court, and was in control of that point until a slight mishit on his forehand, but Djokovic can\u2019t make it count, and we\u2019re back to deuce. He looks pained. But that was a zany service return from Murray: wild and reckless, like his 2008 hair cut. Djokovic is out of a jam there: that was a chance for Murray to earn his second break. Here\u2019s Simon McMahon: \u201cEvening Tim. That was some game. COME ON ANDY!!!\u201d *Djokovic 1-4 Murray (*denotes next server) Belinda Bencic wins the women\u2019s final after Simona Halep retires at 0-3 down in the final set. Well done to her. Murray has been hitting the ball well so far, but Djokovic is back at 30-30. Now deuce: Murray\u2019s serve was malfunctioning in that last point. But that\u2019s an ace! Down the middle, and he has the advantage, and that\u2019s good pressure from Murray, pushing a deep forehand down the line and coming to the net. He leads 4-1. Djokovic 1-3 Murray* (*denotes next server) Brad Gilbert says courtside is \u201cincredibly toasty. Touching a buck 22 down there.\u201d I think that\u2019s 122F: jeez, that\u2019s hot. Djokovic misses an easy put-away and it\u2019s 0-15, but then cushions a nice volley that Murray can\u2019t return. Djokovic isn\u2019t quite into his serving stride, and Murray moves to 15-30, and now two break points! He really peppered Djokovic in that point, but Nole missed a midcourt forehand he should have made: 15-40, and a real chance to break. Murray challenges a ball that\u2019s six inches long. He knew it. 30-40. And that\u2019s beautiful from Djokovic a lovely wide second serve, and a delicate cushioned volley to win the point. Deuce, and two break points saved. Murray responds, though, and that\u2019s another break point! Murray is seriously pissed with himself: he got a good look at that passing shot, and missed it. Fume! Djokovic doesn\u2019t miss the chance to get out of trouble, but Murray evens things up after a lovely deft volley. Deuce again! This is going to be a long afternoon, isn\u2019t it? Advantage Murray! Break point no 4! And he just floats a nothing backhand long! He\u2019s so mad with himself. But that\u2019s advantage, and now he breaks! About time! *Djokovic 1-2 Murray (*denotes next server) Murray hits an ace down the line that is called in. Djokovic challenges \u2013 he\u2019s unsuccessful: the ball was in. But Nole doesn\u2019t like it! The ball definitely looked out on the replay, but the caption flashed up: \u201cIn.\u201d Djokovic doesn\u2019t like it. 30-0. Murray is wide with a forehand \u2013 that was sloppy \u2013 and it\u2019s 30-15, and then a whipped forehand is just the wrong side of the line. 30-30. Murray\u2019s first serve is powerful, and Djokovic can\u2019t return it, but that\u2019s a fabulous answer from Djokovic, and we\u2019re at deuce. Advantage Murray, but then he\u2019s long after a monster rally! How many shots was that? 30? Second deuce. And again, advantage Murray, and then back to deuce! Murray just about does enough: that was a battle. Djokovic 1-1 *Murray (*denotes next server) Easy hold for Djokovic. The women\u2019s final, by the way, is into a tie-break in the second. *Djokovic 0-1 Murray (*denotes next server) And Murray gets the opening game under his belt. It\u2019s really hot in Montreal, but Murray begins with a service game to 15. Solid start. Five-five in this second set. Bencic is really tight; Halep is really injured. Who wants to win it? Of Halep, Pam Shriver says on commentary: \u201cI don\u2019t know how she\u2019s still in this.\u201d But now Halep breaks back! Ah, here we go: Murray and Nole have just walked out in Montreal, but ESPN is following the women\u2019s final for the time being. Bencic has just broken back! So she\u2019s serving for the title. This would be just her second tour championship: she won in Eastbourne earlier this year. I *think* I\u2019m right in saying that even though these finals are taking place in opposing cities \u2013 Canada\u2019s best cities! Sorry Vancouver \u2013 the men won\u2019t start till the women finish: for television purposes, I guess. Halep looked dead and buried, and she\u2019s suffering with injury in the heat, but she\u2019s just broken Bencic, and it\u2019s 3-4 in the second. Ergo, we could be waiting a while yet. This is lovely story by my colleague Bryan Graham on Vicky Duval, who, after breaking into the top 100, was told she had Hodgkins lymphona. On Wednesday, she played her first match in 14 months, and she\u2019s got an eye on this month\u2019s US Open in New York: No 2 seed Simona Halip is taking on Belinda Bencic in the final of the women\u2019s singles in Toronto, but Bencic has taken the first set. It\u2019s 2-2 in the second. A nice match-up today in the final of the Rogers Cup in Montreal: Andy Murray takes on Novak Djokovic for cash, prizes and prestige. Regardless of the outcome, Murray will move up to No2 in the world, for the first time since 2013, and has the chance to snap an eight-match losing streak against Nole. Djokovic, for his part, wants to win his seventh title of the year, and for someone to stop lighting up that fat one. Play begins at 3pm local time, 8pm BST. Join me! Tim will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s why Novak Djokovic thought someone was high: Djokovic said of the cannabis smell after his semi-final: \u201cYou can\u2019t believe how bad it was. Whoever it is, I hope he doesn\u2019t come back tomorrow. He\u2019s probably on the seventh sky somewhere.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
