The clubs, including Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea, Leeds and Rangers, agreed that change was necessary to give the competition more credibility and exposure, as well as greater television revenue. Under the new system clubs knocked out of the Champions League will no longer drop into the lesser competition, which will start a group stage of its own to guarantee more matches for the big clubs. To make room for the group stage, the tournament will be trimmed from 96 to 64 teams, starting with a seeded, knock-out preliminary round with 32 teams making up the groups. Representatives of 73 clubs are at the two-day meeting. They considered several proposals for the reorganisation of the Uefa Cup, submitted after the current format became increasingly unpopular with leading teams, before agreeing upon this solution. \"The consensus was that the Uefa Cup must change and that there should be no step down from the Champions League,\" said the Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein, whose club dropped out of the continent's premier competition two years ago and progressed to the Uefa Cup final. \"This is only a recommendation and the first stage of a process that will have to be rubber-stamped by the various committees but the view of the clubs is that there should be no second bite of the cherry.\" Sources within Uefa insist that any consensus reached during the two-day meeting of leading clubs, which ends this afternoon, is extremely unlikely to be challenged. But the changes will not be ratified in time for the start of next season, leaving 2003 as the likely start date. \"We are trying to get as much feedback as possible,\" said the Uefa general secretary Gerhard Aigner. \"Even if the clubs in the Uefa Cup want to play more matches we still have to see whether the market can absorb the idea.\" Other items on the agenda for the annual meeting, held at Uefa's headquarters in Nyon, include the adoption of Europe-wide transfer windows and the possible return of artificial turf to top-level football. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
