Mr Ravalomanana's vow to crush the \"enemies of the nation\" amounted to a declaration of war on supporters of the incumbent president, Didier Ratsiraka, who was forced to flee a velvet revolution in the capital, Antananarivo, in February after ruling for 20 years. Mr Ratsiraka has since established a rival capital in the second city, Toamasina, and has rallied support in the provinces and blockaded the capital. Loyal paratroopers have set up barricades and blown up bridges to cut off the three main roads into Antananarivo, starving its 2 million inhabitants of food and fuel supplies for nearly two months. Madagascar's political crisis began with disputed elections in December. While officially no candidate won a majority, Mr Ravalomanana claimed more than 50% of the vote, and the presidency. Refusing a rerun, he called a million people on to the streets in mostly peaceful protests, culminating in his party's seizure of government offices and Mr Ratsiraka's flight. It has since been unclear who controls the Indian Ocean island state. Although virtually friendless in Antananarivo, where he is blamed for the effects of World Bank-sponsored austerity measures, Mr Ratsiraka commands wide support in rural areas. In a bid to extend his control, Mr Ravalomanana has appointed local administrations to run Madagascar's six provinces. But five of the existing governors have refused to step down, and Mr Ravalomanana is unsure of the army's loyalty in forcing them to leave. The army's decision to stand aside as Mr Ravalomanana's supporters - led by a band of nuns - stormed the government offices, was crucial to his success. At the time, Mr Ravalomanana, a self-made yoghurt millionaire, was hailed as a popular leader. But during recent clashes be tween rival supporters, claiming up to 26 lives, the revolution has turned bloody. Last week, police fired on a crowd of pro-Ravalomanana protesters in the southern town of Fianarantsoa, killing three people and wounding 31. Meanwhile, Antananarivo has almost run out of fuel and is experiencing food queues. \"Essential supplies, especially those that come from the coast, have disappeared from the markets,\" an Antananarivo resident told Reuters. \"It's really hard for me to get sugar, salt, oil - if you want good quality you have to go to the black market.\" On Wednesday, the UN warned of a scarcity of essential medicines and the prospect of cholera. Scorning a French effort to mediate between the sides, Mr Ratsiraka is refusing to negotiate until Mr Ravalomanana renounces the presidency. Mr Ravalomanana insists the blockade must first be lifted. Analysts say Mr Ratsiraka is gaining most from the impasse, as the shortages in Antananarivo turn residents against the man they swept to power. Mr Ravalomanana's declaration of war was seen more as an attempt to rally his supporters than as signalling an invasion of the provinces. A colonel in the capital said that troops loyal to Mr Ravalomanana did not have enough guns for such an attack. Meanwhile, prostitutes loyal to Mr Ravalomanana launched an alternative attack on the barricades, stripping naked outside Toamasina to demand an end to the blockade. They were persuaded to put their clothes back on after bribes from the local governor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
