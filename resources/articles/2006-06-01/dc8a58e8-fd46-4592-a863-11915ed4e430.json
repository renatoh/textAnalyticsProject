It tends to pass quickly but is uncomfortable and alarming. My GP can't shed any light on it. What do you advise? Generally, for cystitis, I would advise avoiding alcohol, vinegar and caffeine, and drinking at least 1.5 litres of still filtered or mineral water throughout the day. Unsweetened cranberry or blueberry juice (300ml a day), or cranberry extract (400mg twice a day), make the urine less inviting to bacteria and reduce the ability of bacteria to adhere to the lining of the bladder. Even if there is no evidence of infection, your body is telling you that something is not right and you are wise to listen to it. There could be an irritation or allergic reaction perhaps aggravated by alcohol and linked to other factors such as hormone imbalance, stress or food intolerance. Your fierce symptoms can be 'cooled' with herbs - 1tsp slippery elm powder daily (mixed with a mug of hot water) and St John's wort (two tablets a day) would soothe and calm the bladder. Combine these with vitamin C (ascorbic acid), goldenseal extract and probiotics (eg Acidophilus Extra 10). Cranberry, probiotics, vitamin C and herbs from Nature's Best (01892 552117, naturesbest.co.uk); slippery elm from G Baldwin &amp; Co (020-7703 5550, baldwins.co.uk). My husband and I have recently returned from a trip to New Zealand. We have suffered terrible jet lag and are now worried about one of our sons, culminating in our feeling very stressed, low on energy and having trouble sleeping. Can you help? Neurotone is a herbal remedy for the relief of stress, anxiety and irritability. It contains hops, valerian and skullcap, which act on the nervous system to reduce tension, and gentian to settle nervous stomachs and boost immunity. You could also take Goodnight, a herbal concoction that contains valerian, passiflora, hops and wild lettuce - all recommended for stress-related sleep disorders - and vervain, which calms anxiety. Both are by Bio-Health, from independent pharmacies and health-food shops. Take daily exercise such as a brisk walk, and try yoga. Emotional freedom techniques can be excellent for bringing calm and balance to your life - go to emofree.com. \u00b7 Emma Mitchell is a natural health therapist.
