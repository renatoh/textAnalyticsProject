The Liverpool manager remains livid with Barry for favouring City's ambitions above Champions League football at Anfield, having spent 12 months attempting to lure the England international from Aston Villa. Ben\u00edtez was caught cold by Barry's \u00a312m move to City as soon as the transfer window reopened last month and, despite the midfielder's protestations that he wanted to avoid a repeat of last year's saga with Liverpool, believes the decision was based entirely on the offer of \u00a3130,000 a week. City's package is at least \u00a330,000 a week more than Barry would have earned at Anfield and, Ben\u00edtez argued, tempted the former Villa captain to make the wrong career move. \"Maybe it's just me but in this market, the top level, I don't think money is the most important thing,\" the Liverpool manager said. \"At this level everyone earns big money. The question is do you make the right decisions and do what is best for your career? If it's just for money sometimes you will make mistakes and I've been surprised by some decisions this summer \u2013 like Barry. I won't say too much but it was clearly 100% for money. The most important thing for me, though, is the passion of the players.\" Barry's transfer was beyond Ben\u00edtez's control but he is determined to dictate the futures of Alonso and Mascherano, two midfielders under contract at Anfield but coveted by Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively. Liverpool have not received an offer from either of the Spanish giants for their midfield pair, despite almost daily declarations of intent from the Bernab\u00e9u and Camp Nou, and Ben\u00edtez is adamant he will not be forced into a sale either by his players or their suitors. Liverpool's hardball stance could change if they receive a staggering offer from Real or Barcelona and a transfer request from Alonso or Mascherano in the coming weeks. Ben\u00edtez, however, is aggrieved at the uncertainty surrounding two influential players, and the fact it is largely of the midfielders' own making, with his transfer strategy now heavily dependent on whether Alonso and/or Mascherano stay or leave. The Liverpool manager said: \"When you are the manager of a top side you can tell players that they are staying. You have to decide about the way to do things but I don't have a problem with that. We have to be strong enough and, if we have to be, we will be. Both players are under contract and we are really pleased about that. \"Don't forget we signed Alonso from Real Sociedad when nobody knew about him and we renewed his contract two years ago, so he was happy then, and you know what happened with Mascherano at West Ham before we brought him here. Both players owe a lot to Liverpool. They owe Liverpool some loyalty and they both know that.\" Ben\u00edtez would not divulge what his response would be should Alonso or Mascherano submit a transfer request, however. \"That is not the case at the moment,\" he added. \"At the moment we are pleased with them. I don't know what can happen but both players are under contract.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
