Attracting attention will be the leaders of the new vanguard of brands blazing a trail including Craig Green, Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, Liam Hodges, Edward Crutchley, A-Cold-Wall and Martine Rose. They are joined by high-profile fashion houses Iceberg, E.Tautz, Chalayan and Alexander McQueen \u2013 the latter a new addition to the regular schedule \u2013 as well as a crop of designers breaking with convention such as Art School, Stefan Cooke, Paria/Farzaneh and Xander Zhou. Proving that the UK remains fertile ground for the freshest of fashion talent, the incubator Fashion East will once again showcase the work of three emerging talents. This season, its ones to watch are Mowalola, Robyn Lynch and Saul Nash. Notable absentees include Kent &amp; Curwen \u2013 David Beckham\u2019s brand \u2013 and the award-winning Cottweiler, which has opted for an online presentation instead of a show. \u201cIt\u2019s a strong season with amazing names,\u201d says Dylan Jones, chair of the British Fashion Council and editor-in-chief of GQ. \u201cLondon seems to be the only fashion capital of the world regenerating itself on a regular basis. It\u2019s always had an innate ability to produce creative people, whether it\u2019s in music, art or fashion design.\u201d The busyness of the schedule is rivalled by only Paris, with this summer\u2019s New York and Milan events struggling to secure back-to-back highlights. It lands in London as new figures reveal that the UK menswear market is estimated to have grown by 3.5% since 2017. In order to maintain momentum, Jones says that it\u2019s imperative to surprise people. \u201cConsumers are curious \u2013 we all want the new, the fresh, the modern.\u201d The new is currently proving tricky ground to navigate, with an increased focus on sustainability and efforts to curb the insatiable consumption of clothes in particular. It can make for bittersweet appreciation of a showcase designed to present copious amounts of newness. Jones says that \u201cit\u2019s incumbent on the fashion industry to find new ways of engaging with the consumer\u201d and that while menswear \u2013 with its focus on functionality \u2013 tends to lend itself more naturally to a buy less, buy better model, the responsibility lies at the door of fast fashion and poorly made product. \u201cObviously we\u2019re all in the business of selling and commerce \u2013 its a transactional industry, but there needs to be a tradeoff,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the main [this argument] should be directed at the high street. Fast fashion is terrible, not only for the environment, but for the halo effect it has on the whole of the industry in total. If you look at a lot of the luxury brands, they are making goods to last. Think of a Herm\u00e8s handbag, you\u2019re not buying a new one every six months. That\u2019s investment buying, which is what menswear has always been about.\u201d Presenting their collections this weekend are several designers celebrated for adopting an ethical and considered approach, including Ahluwalia Studio, Samuel Ross and Bethany Williams, who was awarded the Queen Elizabeth award in February for her endeavours. Also joining proceedings will be sustainable designers Christopher Raeburn and Duran Lantinck, who will take part in an upcycling masterclass with producer, actor and activist Lena Waithe. While LFWM is held in London, the BFC is currently actively incubating talent from around the UK. Three years ago, it launched its Saturday Clubs in collaboration with the Sorrell Foundation. It\u2019s an initiative that aims to give young people aged 14 to 16 the chance to study at a local institution for free. The aim, says Jones, is to give future talent the support and advice needed to be pursue successful careers. \u201cIt\u2019s a version of apprenticeship,\u201d says Jones. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s missing is a vertical line of people getting into our industry. People think about the fashion industry and think you can only be a fashion designer but think about the hundreds of different jobs involved in fashion. From design to manufacturing to content to production, it\u2019s a huge business and it\u2019s always very important to try and encourage young people. A lot of these teenagers don\u2019t leave their borough and its difficult to draw a line between their situations and people in the fashion industry. It\u2019s incumbent on us to do the outreach \u2013 we need to go into these communities to try and help.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
