Showing little ambition to attack despite playing at home, Southampton held Liverpool to a goalless draw with the sort of tactics that Liverpool may well have to get used to as opponents try to nullify the threat of Klopp\u2019s free-flowing team. Far from criticising Southampton, Klopp empathised with Claude Puel, his opposite number, and admitted it would be \u201ccrazy\u201d for teams to open up against Liverpool. The German said the onus was on Liverpool to find ways to break down obdurate opponents while retaining their concentration at the other end of the pitch \u2013 something he took encouragement from at Southampton, where Liverpool enjoyed 65% possession and were rarely troubled at the back. \u201cI felt we had more possession. My feeling was we had 70%, no problem,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cIf we play this football then it would be crazy to give us space, so why would they do that? That is what we have to work on, it is our job and we have the players for it. It is never easy, you cannot only play counterattack, you cannot only play high-press, you have to prepare for everything. \u201cThere is nothing to moan about, you can\u2019t ask them: \u2018Come on, give us a little more space or something?\u2019 Before the season we had to work on this, and that is what I meant when I say we are happy with the performance against Southampton, because again we did well. It isn\u2019t a game where you have 20 chances, we had four or five. That is more than enough, especially how big those chances were.\u201d It was put to Klopp that United set up with a similar mindset in the 0-0 draw at Anfield last month. \u201cUnited was different. We weren\u2019t good,\u201d Klopp said, before reinforcing the point that he has no qualms about facing opponents who defend in numbers. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a problem. A lot of teams play against us like this, we move on. We cannot change what other teams do. \u201cThe only thing we have to make sure is that [failing to get a good result] isn\u2019t because of us \u2013 that is what I am so happy about [against Southampton]. The players are concentrating, staying in games when it doesn\u2019t work and not letting them counterattack if we defend. My favourite situation was when [Nathan] Redmond counterattacked against four Liverpool players and we got the ball back because he couldn\u2019t see another Southampton player \u2013 that is what we have to do. We have to take the ball and try again. We cannot do any more and then we will come through. We have the quality to score.\u201d The clean sheet at Southampton was only Liverpool\u2019s second of the season in the league, although Klopp feels far too much has been made of their defensive weaknesses. \u201cWhen you only look at the numbers and you see 14 goals conceded, then that is obviously too much for a team like this, but look how we conceded them \u2013 three goals we conceded are from set pieces. Well, in my analysis afterwards they were offside but nobody spoke about it, just that we have a problem with set pieces. \u201cWe always need to be cool with it, we have to work, improve, we know this. But we are able to defend. We are not weak in defending. If somebody wants to say that then do it. But I know we aren\u2019t.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
