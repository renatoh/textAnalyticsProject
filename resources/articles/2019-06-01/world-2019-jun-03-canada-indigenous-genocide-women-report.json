Indigenous communities across the country have for decades attempted to convey the depth and scope of a tragedy that has haunted thousands of families. As many as 4,000 Indigenous women and girls are believed to have been killed or gone missing in Canada over the past 30 years \u2013 although the true number of victims is unlikely ever to be known. On Monday the findings of a three-year inquiry were released at a solemn ceremony in Quebec, attended by victims\u2019 families, survivors, Indigenous leaders and senior government officials. \u201cThis is an uncomfortable day for Canada,\u201d said the prime minister, Justin Trudeau. \u201cWe have failed you. We will fail you no longer.\u201d The inquiry\u2019s final report, a 1,200-page catalogue of historical and contemporary injustices, concludes that decades of policy and state indifference amounted to genocide against Indigenous peoples. The report\u2019s authors were blunt in their assessment: \u201cIf you\u2019re not outraged, you\u2019re not paying attention \u2026 This is every Canadian\u2019s responsibility not to turn a blind eye.\u201d The report, called Reclaiming Power and Place, marks the government\u2019s most signifiant attempt at determining the scope of the epidemic of violence that has claimed the lives of thousands of indigenous women. \u201cThe violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA [two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and asexual] people is a national tragedy of epic proportion,\u201d wrote the chief commissioner, Marion Buller. Commission members conceded that the term \u201cgenocide\u201d is likely to provoke controversy in the country but said they carefully examined the United Nations definition of the term \u2013 as well as its original intent from the 1940s. \u201cGenocide is the sum of the social practices, assumptions, and actions detailed within this report,\u201d they wrote. Indigenous activists hailed the report as an important turning point. \u201cIt\u2019s powerful. It\u2019s sad. It angers me. But it\u2019s also hopeful because it shows the real strength, resilience and determination of Indigenous women and girls,\u201d said Pam Palmater, a Mi\u2019kmaq law professor at Ryerson University. \u201cOur First Nations communities, our leaders and our activists just never gave up. They kept pushing and pushing.\u201d But others who attended the ceremony were disappointed by Trudeau\u2019s failure to present new policies. \u201cThe prime minister really offered up nothing more than words,\u201d said Cindy Blackstock, a Gitxsan child welfare advocate and professor. \u201cI was looking for something that would actually make a difference in the lives of women and girls today.\u201d Blackstock noted that the government\u2019s recent budget that did not allocate any funding to implement the recommendations of the long-expected inquiry. The inquiry \u2013 an electoral promise by Trudeau after the previous Conservative government refused to open one \u2013 accepted submissions from 2,380 people, including the testimony of 468 family members of survivors and victims across the country at 15 community hearings. \u201cMany Indigenous people have grown up normalized to violence, while Canadian society shows an appalling apathy to addressing the issue,\u201d the commissioners wrote. The report also includes 231 recommendations for future action. \u201cIt must be understood that these recommendations, which we frame as \u2018Calls for Justice,\u2019 are legal imperatives \u2013 they are not optional,\u201d said the report. The wide-ranging recommendations include overhauling policing practices in Indigenous communities, giving Indigenous languages official status, creating a universal basic income and investing in early childhood programs for Indigenous youth. While the document exposes a damning narrative of the country\u2019s history, it also encourages a path forward. \u201cFor many non-Indigenous people, it\u2019s important to be ready to \u2018unlearn\u2019 some learned behaviours,\u201d said the report. Veldon Coburn, who teaches Indigenous studies at Carleton University, said Canadians need to understand the role of state institutions such as residential schools where more than 150,000 aboriginal children were taken in an attempt to forcibly assimilate them into Canadian society \u2013 and work to dismantle those practices. But he added that Canadians also need to work to dismantle those practices. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any settler Canadian who should feel personally responsible for this. They\u2019ve never carried this out themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be forward looking, in the true spirit of reconciliation with one another, saying we want to live in a community and respect the existence of our shared humanity.\u201d Before Canadian society begins to grapple with such difficult questions, Coburn said attention should be focused on the memories of the thousands of Indigenous peoples were murdered or have gone missing. \u201cThe biggest point today is to honour those that are the most vulnerable within Canadian society, and who have borne the brunt of considerable discrimination and marginalization,\u201d he said. \u201c[Their] lives are worthy of equal concern and respect.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
