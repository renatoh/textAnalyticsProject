But the conversation continues, despite factors that threaten to subvert it or to drown it out. The difficulties appear to be, in ascending order of significance: the amount of personal abuse directed at writers, particularly those dealing with controversial issues, such as the Middle East; the sheer volume of email, which exceptionally can reach several hundred in response to a single article; and the smothering effect of spam, unsolicited and unwanted junk mail. Spam, despite a recent great improvement in filtering, remains the biggest problem for many journalists. To put it in context, one of the leading anti-spam companies has calculated that the spam and virus content of email traffic rose from 49% in June last year to 64% for last month, May. Guardian figures are comparable. In April the Guardian received about 2m emails, 66% of which were stopped by spam filters. In May there were 1.8m incoming emails of which 64% were filtered out. A small number of genuine emails are lost in this battle to keep clear what is now easily the most preferred channel of communication. Despite all efforts, spam will continue to increase in email queues because no system can block it all, because total spam traffic is increasing hugely, and because the originators of spam will find ways round filters. The worst-case scenario is that within a few years the system will be overwhelmed and what was widely welcomed as an empowering tool of democracy will be rendered useless. In their correspondence with me this week, some journalists suggested that in addition to to putting up filters, email addresses on the website should be \"cloaked\" so that, while still providing users with the details, they could not be harvested by software robots which gather the addresses to sell on to the senders of spam. A middle way, suggested by several journalists, would be to encourage greater use of section postboxes, of the kind the Comment desk offers. In fact, the Comment editors regard the section postbox as a back up for writers who for some reason do not want their individual email addresses published. Monitoring these sectional email addresses is an extra demand on already stretched administrative resources. It means taking time daily to sift through the emails, throwing out the rubbish and identifying those that should be sent on to the journalist. About a dozen high-profile journalists, who cover particularly controversial areas, have a second email address for publication, so their personal queue is kept clear. One of the paper's political journalists underlined the problem experienced in varying degree by others. \"When I first joined the Guardian a couple of years ago, I was delighted to find a crop of emails after every piece I wrote, but I fear they have now become a huge burden. \"It is true that they are slightly more manageable since the anti-spam device was introduced but I still find that I spend too many hours ploughing through them ... time which I think could be spent more fruitfully elsewhere.\" A leading columnist had a similar story. \"I spend more and more time each week answering emails and I do try to answer all of them.\" That was not possible, though, if the column had mentioned Iraq, or anything apparently anti-American, or the Middle East. Then \"the whole world\" replied. \"I have been thinking recently that spending so many hours - probably at least eight a week or more, evenings and weekends - answering them all is madness. It becomes obsessive and you start arguing back with all kinds of people, trying to persuade the whole world out there of something or other. Though people do appreciate, and are surprised by, a personal reply.\" This columnist suggested that a feedback facility in place of a personal email address at the foot of pieces on the website could be one way to ease the burden. Then the correspondent could dip in to add comments or to answer points in exchanges which would be open to all. In fact, this is something that is being explored at the moment.
