The disc\u2019s capacious theme is the ground bass (in which a melodic pattern recurs in the bass part) through musical history, from early Spanish chaconnes, or chacona, to Purcell (Dido\u2019s Lament Remix) to Bach\u2019s Partita in D minor for Solo Violin, BWV 1004. The ensemble\u2019s Swedish name means Un/Modern, encouraging a refreshing exchange of past and present styles. It works, helped by injections of new sounds from composers Du\u0161an Bogdanovi\u0107 and Johannes Marm\u00e9n, all beautifully played. \u2022 You\u2019d be forgiven for scratching your head at the name Chiara Margarita Cozzolani (1602-c77). The music of the Italian Benedictine sister, like that of other cloistered nuns of the period, has remained virtually unknown. She was the abbess of a thriving monastery in Milan, yet managed to have four volumes of her sacred music published. Emiliano Gonzalez Toro and his ensemble I Gemelli, a group specialising in 17th-century music, have reconstructed Cozzolani\u2019s Vespers (Na\u00efve) based on the printed edition of 1650. This collection of psalm settings and motets displays Cozzolani\u2019s gift for complexity, sensuality and variety, sometimes using two choirs (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), or solo voices, and often reminiscent of Monteverdi\u2019s Vespers of 1610. There\u2019s also a ciaccona ground bass at the end of the delicate O quam bonus es. \u2022 Taking the bottom line question a step further, in an old episode of Radio 3\u2019s The Listening Service (BBC Sounds) Tom Service asks: \u201cWhy are we all addicted to bass?\u201d From baroque vocal to orchestral to dubstep to R&amp;B, the answers are stranger than you\u2019d think."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
