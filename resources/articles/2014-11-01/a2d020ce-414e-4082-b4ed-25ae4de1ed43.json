City face Bayern Munich at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday evening needing victory to retain the best hope of emerging from Group E after taking only two points from four games. If Pep Guardiola\u2019s team are defeated City will need to beat Roma in the final match and hope other results go their way. Bayern, who have already qualified for the knockout stage, handed City a 1-0 defeat in the opening group match. Yet after Pellegrini guided the champions to the last 16 for the first time last season, Nasri is clear the squad will have failed if they do not emerge from the group once more. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, with the salary of every player and the level of those players, 90% of the team is world class, then not to qualify from the first round of the Champions League would be a huge blow for the club \u2013 and for us as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing in the Champions League is not just the talent, it\u2019s not being a team, it\u2019s the experience as well. We need to show we are smart players and to use what happened in the last couple of years to improve. We still have a chance and we need to take it. Now is the moment.\u201d Many of Pellegrini\u2019s team are in their prime and Nasri understands now is the time to deliver. \u201cSometimes people have said our team is a little bit old and for example a midfield player is in his prime at 27-31, 28-32, so I think it\u2019s the perfect age,\u201d the Frenchman said, before suggesting players\u2019 futures could be in danger. \u201cWe need to do something or otherwise next year it is going to be new players, it\u2019s going to be everything. That\u2019s how we work when you play for a big team, a big club. You have to respond and show everyone you deserve to qualify. \u201cWe need to show hunger and ambition in every game but most important in this kind of game. In the last three years I have been here we have won the league twice and been runners-up but now we have to improve in the Champions League if we want to be a top club. It\u2019s not enough to be top in your league if you don\u2019t do anything in the Champions League. With the players we have and everything, the owner gives us his trust, we have to return it in the Champions League. It\u2019s the perfect scene to show we can compete with the best teams in the world.\u201d After the defeat at Bayern, City drew 1-1 with Roma and 2-2 at CSKA Moscow before losing 2-1 to the Russian champions. Nasri believes the talking has to stop. \u201cWe are a team that wants to win no matter what,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a chance to play for a big club, we are treated the right way and sometimes as well it\u2019s not good to talk too much, it\u2019s better to talk with your feet and I think it\u2019s the best answer to give. But we have leaders in the squad and the manager talks a lot as well. So stop talking.\u201d Bayern are in impressive form. They lead the Bundesliga by seven points and beat Hoffenheim 4-0 at the weekend. Nasri hopes they will field a weakened team. \u201cHopefully Guardiola will not play his full squad \u2013 I saw that all of them played on Saturday \u2013 so let\u2019s see,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, they\u2019ve topped the group but I don\u2019t think Guardiola will do us any favours. He\u2019s a guy who likes to win every game. We don\u2019t know what system he will play \u2013 he can play 4-5-1, 3-6-1, 3-5-2 so we\u2019ll see.\u201d City have gone behind in their past two Premier League games but Nasri added they cannot afford to do that against Bayern. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial,\u201d he said. \u201cA team like Bayern, once they take the lead it\u2019s really hard as you have to run after the ball and they always have an extra man in midfield so it\u2019s going to be really important to start the game really well against this kind of team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
