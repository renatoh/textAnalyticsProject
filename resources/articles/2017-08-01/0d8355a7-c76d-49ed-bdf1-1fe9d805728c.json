Top stories Details of the Queensland government\u2019s royalty deal with Adani for its Carmichael mine in Queensland are being kept secret, with freedom of information requests resulting in thousands of pages of redacted or withheld documents. But the correspondence that was released on its \u201ctransparent policy framework\u201d appears to show public servants scrambling to find an economic justification for the policy announcement and suggests the framework \u2013 touted as a way to open the Galilee and Surat basins \u2013 was designed specifically for Adani. Anastacia Palaszczuk promised before the election to not do any \u201csecret deals\u201d, and argued the Adani project must \u201cstand alone on its feet \u2026 on the economics of the project itself\u201d. But an Australia Institute researcher, Tom Swann, says that is not how the deal has revealed itself. \u201cThere was backlash about giving Adani free coal so they worked out another way to support Adani through royalties. It\u2019s ended up being a subsidised loan and in the process they\u2019ve created a framework that is open to any new coalmine in the state in a greenfield area.\u201d A former White House lawyer says he believes Donald Trump \u201cobstructed justice\u201d by drafting his son\u2019s statement about his meeting with a Russian lawyer. Richard Painter, an ethics lawyer under George W Bush, told the Guardian: \u201cYou\u2019re boxing in a witness into a false story\u201d and that \u201cputs them under enormous pressure to turn around and lie under oath to be consistent with their story.\u201d The White House faces further scrutiny this week after the Washington Post reported on Monday that Trump dictated the statement that dismissed the significance of a meeting between his son Donald Trump Jr, his top campaign aides Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, and the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June 2016. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders has denied Trump dictated the statement but said: \u201cHe weighed in, offered suggestion like any father would do.\u201d One of the most radical transformations in Australian households has been in attitudes to same-sex rights, as an in-depth snapshot of Australian domestic life released today finds. Almost two-thirds of Australians now support equal rights for same-sex couples, a dramatic rise from just 38% in 2005, according to the latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey. The Tasmanian Liberal senator Eric Abetz says the Turnbull government should pursue a postal plebiscite and has warned Liberal MPs against crossing the floor. The Hilda survey further revealed that poverty rates are increasing among single-parent families, with rising childcare costs, stagnant wage growth, falling home ownership and low child support payments fuelling financial strain. The report described the likelihood of child poverty in single-parent families as \u201cvery high\u201d, hovering at a rate between 20% to 25%, well above the general community rate of about 10%. Labor will today outline its plans to overhaul Australia\u2019s workplace laws and boost the bargaining power of workers at a time when wage growth is stagnant and the labour market is in transition. The opposition workplace relations spokesman, Brendan O\u2019Connor, will use a major speech to the Sydney Institute this evening to make the case that the dwindling bargaining power of workers and trade unions has played a central role in low wages growth and the \u201cproliferation\u201d of insecure work. One person is killed every day in India by a roaming elephant or tiger as humans and wildlife continue to clash while the animals\u2019 natural habits is encroached on. Statistics released this week by India\u2019s environment ministry reveal that 1,144 people were killed between April 2014 and May 2017. India\u2019s population of 1.3bn is still growing, and as it does it is increasingly encroaching into the country\u2019s traditional wild spaces and animal sanctuaries, where people compete with wildlife for food and other resources. India\u2019s elephants remain some of the most hunted animals in the country; sought for their ivory tusks and bones that are sold on the black market, or threatened by speeding trains. Sport The superstar runner Usain Bolt has warned his fellow runners to stop doping otherwise track and field events will die. The Jamaican sprinter said the sport was on the mend after the staggering revelations of state-sponsored doping in Russia but conceded more needed to be done to tackle the scourge of performance-enhancing drugs. \u201cI said a couple of years ago it had to get really bad, when there\u2019s nowhere else to go but up. The only way track and field has left to go is up.\u201d The AFL International Cup lands in Melbourne this weekend but for all the fanfare around the tournament, the AFL still views itself through the prism of its own 18-team competition and not as the authority for an entire sport, writes Antoun Issa. The Australian Rugby Union has agreed to cut one of Australia\u2019s five Super Rugby teams to help Sanzaar reduce the number of sides in the competition from 18 to 15 for next season. The convoluted process has dragged on for months and shows no sign of resolution \u2013 should Australia follow the New Zealand\u2019s centralised rugby system instead? Yes, writes Bret Harris. Remodelling of the franchise structure is key to the future health of super rugby. Thinking time Most pet owners consider their animals part of the family, and some even include them in census returns. But a growing body of research casts doubt on the ethics of owning a pet. From increasingly unhealthy purebred canines to the goldfish sold by the bag pet-keeping denies animals the right of self-determination, some ethicists argue, and treats them as a commodity. Science continues to prove animals are intelligent and emotionally complex beings, and some countries have bestowed them sentient status \u2013 so should we stop keeping them as pets? With earnings for median income households stalling and people under 40 less able to afford a home than ever inequality remains a major political issue, writes Greg Jericho, who mines the rich data of this year\u2019s Hilda report. \u201cThe Hilda report highlights that while it is all very well to split hairs about short-term movements of income inequality measures like the Gini coefficient, for median income households income has now stalled for six years,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe report provides damning evidence that inequality across generations has increased \u2013 with those under 40 now much less able to buy a home than were young people in previous years.\u201d Despite their beauty and abundance, modern-day flowers are something of a scientific mystery, with little known about their evolution and origin. The evolution of flowering plants also foxed Charles Darwin, who described their sudden diversification as an \u201can abominable mystery\u201d. Now a team of scientists has constructed a family tree of flowering plants based on genetic data from 792 species, and mapped the structural characteristics of the plants\u2019 flowers. So what does the ancestral flower of all living flowering plants look like? White, delicate, and upturned. See for yourself. What\u2019s he done now? Amid internal fighting at the White House and claims he dictated son Donald Trump Jr\u2019s statement about a meeting with a Russian lawyer, the US president has had a quiet night on Twitter by his standards. \u201cOnly the Fake News Media and Trump enemies want me to stop using Social Media (110 million people),\u201d he tweeted this morning. \u201cOnly way for me to get the truth out!\u201d Media roundup The Australian splashes with a report on the declining writing skills of schoolchildren, with the latest Naplan results showing they have slipped in the past six years. Staying on the education theme the Sydney Morning Herald says almost 70% of year 9 students in New South Wales will need to sit an extra reading, writing or numeracy test to be eligible for their HSC. And the ABC has an encouraging report from last night\u2019s Lateline revealing some regional and small-town newspapers might be bucking the general trend of declining readership numbers, and have become trusted and valued sources of local news for their often isolated communities. Coming up The same-sex marriage debate and the release of the latest Naplan results are likely to dominate the news agenda today. The Lowy Institute for International Policy\u2019s executive director, Michael Fullilove, will speak about \u201cAustralia in the Trump era\u201d at the National Press Club.
