The site, with its tall chimneys overlooking the Torrens River, has been making beer deeply associated with a South Australian and working-class identity. The business had endured for 160 years until parent company Lion Nathan announced last month that it was shuttering the operation and shifting production east. Having started up in 1859 on Hindley Street on Adelaide\u2019s west edge, the brewery grew in a series of mergers until 1983 when it moved from the city to its current premises in Thebarton where it made West End draught and Southwark stout. Speaking to reporters, Lion Australia managing director James Brindley blamed the decision to close on \u201clong-term trends and the ongoing viability of the brewery\u201d. \u201cOver the last few decades consumer preferences have changed, the beer market en masse continues to decline and is now at its lowest per capita consumption ever recorded in Australia, while 700 new craft breweries have sprung up so competition is intense \u2026 and the cost base continues to increase,\u201d Brindley said. Market research company Roy Morgan\u2019s work in this area appears to back Lion Nathan\u2019s view, in part. Work from earlier this year found Australians were actually drinking less alcohol overall during the pandemic \u2013 with older people more likely to drink at home. For her part Jade Flavell, the publican of the Wheatsheaf Hotel, a microbrewery, live music venue and pub that operates in Thebarton, says pinning the closure of the brewery on craft beer is \u201cconvenient\u201d cover for deeper issues. \u201cThat\u2019s a cute line from Lion Nathan. I\u2019m sure craft beer would love to have West End as a scalp,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is quite sad. A lot of the people who work there pop in for a beer and a chat. In a broader sense it\u2019s equally as sad, if not more so, that the [company] sold out in the 90s.\u201d She says the closure is what happens when an international conglomerate swoops in to snap up local brands. An ACCC assessment in May 2020 found that two companies, Lion and CUB, account for 80% of Australia\u2019s beer market. In June 2020, CUB was acquired by Asahi Holdings Group. \u201cYes, the beer\u2019s been brewed in Thebarton, but it\u2019s also a brand owned by a global company,\u201d Flavell says. \u201cOnce that happens it\u2019s a bigger creature and they\u2019re not so concerned with local communities. Making money takes priority, not us.\u201d That sentiment is shared by Mark Whenan, United Workers Union SA coordinator of food and beverages, who says the decision was more about achieving economies of scale, which meant the 94 people thrown out of work just didn\u2019t factor. Over the years the workforce watched Lion Nathan \u2013 owned by Japanese beverage company Kirin Brewery Company \u2013 close the Swan Brewery\u2019s Canning Vale operation in Western Australia and shift production of the Swan and Emu brands to South Australia. Later, the company again shifted this production to the east coast, further reducing volume. \u201cAs soon as the decision to close West End was announced, the company were already asking workers in their plants in Victoria to pick up overtime shifts,\u201d Whenan said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been running down the plant for a while now. The company has made deliberate decisions to expand production at Tooheys and XXXX.\u201d Whenan said the union wasn\u2019t given notice of the decision until it was about to happen and some in the workforce were left to find out from the media. Lion Nathan told Guardian Australia they would not comment further on the closure, but said, via media release, that they would \u201cbe consulting with each and every team member to support them through this proposed change\u201d. Billy Ryan, category manager for craft and local beer at Endeavour Group, which supplies Dan Murphy\u2019s and BWS, says it is true consumer tastes are changing. \u201cWhen I started there were 200, 300 breweries in the country and that number has grown phenomenally since,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cOur range has grown with it, though we only stock 140 to 150 different products in store.\u201d With brewers and alcohol merchants looking to the US for the next trend, many have picked up a growing thirst for pre-mixed drinks such as hard seltzer \u2013 a mix of sparkling water and spirit \u2013 that saw massive growth in July when sales jumped 255% in one week. Hard seltzer now accounts for more than 10% of the US beer market. The question is whether Australians will also pick it up. Major brands such Lion Nathan have already cast their bet. In May the company locked down the rights to sell Australians White Claw, the top-selling hard seltzer brand in the US that has captured 60% of the market. Meanwhile, hundreds of smaller breweries across Australia have launched their own hard seltzer product in time for summer \u2013 partly in response to the pandemic. \u201cWhen Covid hit a lot of the smaller breweries, many took a bit of a pause and took some time to reassess their portfolios,\u201d says Danielle Allen, the co-owner of Two Birds, which claims the title of Australia\u2019s first female-owned brewery. \u201cEverybody\u2019s done one. In some shape or form.\u201d When Allen\u2019s business partner, Jayne Lewis, caught the trend for hard seltzer 18 months out, they released their first grapefruit-flavoured drink a year ago and have now followed it up with a watermelon flavour. The women say that while the lockdown kept them from running their tap rooms in inner-city Melbourne, it has brought them closer to their customers, who have made a point to support them. \u201cEvery state is unique in climate, culture and heritage,\u201d Allen says. \u201cEvery single state has its own unique beer that people drink and support. More and more that\u2019s going to become a local brewer, as opposed to one beer drunk across a state. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be unique these days. But you know, hard seltzer is only part of the future ... Beer is timeless. Beer is king. Or queen. Whichever way you look at it.\u201d With the average person now able to choose between 150 different kinds of beer, it\u2019s possible that choice now carries more weight than ever \u2013 especially in a pandemic. Mass market or craft, local or global, what people drink and where they drink it ends up shaping more than just a night out.
