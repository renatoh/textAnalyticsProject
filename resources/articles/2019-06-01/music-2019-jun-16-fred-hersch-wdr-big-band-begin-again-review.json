Not because he\u2019s unknown \u2013 far from it \u2013 but because his constant, undemonstrative presence is too often taken for granted. His best work has been as a soloist or with his piano trio, performing his own shapely, lyrical compositions. He is also a much-praised accompanist to singers. If all this seems a little bland, I suggest you listen to a track here, entitled Out Someplace, subtitled Blues for Matthew Shepard, in memory of a gay man murdered in Wyoming in 1998. A more angry and disturbing piece it\u2019s difficult to imagine, made positively terrifying by the orchestration of Vince Mendoza. Indeed all nine of Hersch\u2019s compositions here, some already well known, gain in colour from Mendoza\u2019s arrangements, not to mention the playing of the Cologne-based WDR band. The sheer brilliance of some European radio bands ensures a regular flow of top US musicians, eager to make use of their talents. The same was true of our own BBC Big Band, but things seem to have gone suspiciously quiet there lately."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
