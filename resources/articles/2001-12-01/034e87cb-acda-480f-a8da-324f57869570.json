But Francois Pienaar's Saracens, like the Springboks themselves, have had an unhappy autumn. In another leafy corner of London's suburbia, though, Dr Brendan Venter's Sunbury-based London Irish have risen to the occasion like patients on Viagra. Nine days ago, the Exiles added to Pienaar's ills as they pulverised an out-of-sorts Saracens 55-13 at Watford, running in seven tries. Four days earlier they had scored a similar number against Northampton. Tomorrow, second-placed Irish entertain the leaders Leicester at Reading in what is the acid test for Venter's exhilarating young side. Irish, whose weekday base is just down the road from Kempton racecourse, are the form-horses of the Premiership and they play rugby at a gallop. If the Springboks have been undone by a drab lack of adventure, Venter's team are leaping the fences. The former Springbok centre's arrival last summer has transformed the club. It has also been ironic. Venter was a player at Irish until he returned home after the 1999 World Cup, and the Exiles' then director of rugby, Dick Best, would forever praise his skills. Last spring, however, Best was told his contract would not be renewed - and Irish began to court Venter. \"The first thing Francois Pienaar said when I told him I was going to become a player-coach was 'Don't',\" Venter says. \"And it is difficult combining the jobs. But I think it gives me an empathy with the players. I know how hard it is out there. The only thing I won't take is mediocrity. And I ask the players to take responsibility on the pitch.\" When attempting to explain Irish's startling form this season, Venter can sound positively Corinthian. But he also knows that, on the Madejski stadium's wide billiard-table surface, rugby should be played at a fast tempo - and that Irish can compete with the Leicesters of this world when it is. \"We want to play proper rugby that our supporters can enjoy,\" he says in the aftermath of a gruelling training session. \"We are performance-driven, not results-driven.\" Appropriate sentiments perhaps for a club who, until recently, would have regarded running out of stout as a far bigger crisis than languishing near the foot of the Premiership like Saracens. But make no mistake, Venter is as hard-nosed about rugby as any Springbok. \"I am not going to rant and rave at players because they make mistakes. We will lose matches but it won't be for a lack of concentration or attitude. I video each game and I assess the players' performance, but they know that I will not castigate them for mistakes. If they don't pull their weight, however, I will destroy them.\" No one, it seems, is given any slack on this score, however old they are and however many caps they possess. \"Chris Sheasby, at 35, is treated the same way as a young player like Paul Sackey,\" Venter says. \"You don't get picked because of the number of internationals you've played. \" Naka Drotske [the Exiles' hooker] is a great friend of mine, I've played most of my rugby with him, but he would be dropped if he wasn't pulling his weight. You don't play yourself into this team, you play yourself out of it. Which is why our young centres Jason Wright and Rob Hoadley won't make way for me when I'm fit, if they continue to play like they did against Saracens.\" Venter will not have that selection problem tomorrow having injured his shoulder recently against Wasps, but in 10 games this season he has helped reinvigorate the Irish backline. He is 32 this month, though, and knows his best playing days are behind him. In fact he has retired once, following an unhappy period playing for the Western Stormers in the Super 12 last year. \"I had another career as a GP, a young family and I decided medicine was where my future lay. I began a practice in Cape Town, but then Irish got in touch and last March I went over to watch them play - on St Patrick's Day - against Northampton. It was obvious things weren't quite right any more so I decided to return. It was difficult for my partner in the practice, but my wife has been very supportive. \"Now I have no interest in retiring - I love it, and I look at Conor O'Shea and my injury problems are put in perspective.\" O'Shea, the former Ireland full-back and the Exiles' club captain, was forced to retire from playing last month with a nagging ankle injury. He has now been appointed director of rugby, a promotion that will have caused a raised eyebrow in the Best household, as the job was deemed redundant last spring. Venter says O'Shea is the best full-back he has played with - \"a remarkable talent\" - which is something from a player who has played alongside Andre Joubert and Percy Montgomery. He is more reluctant to speak about Best, but it is clear the players were unhappy at the former England coach's brand of man-management. Not for nothing was he known as \"Sulphuric\" for his acid tongue. Venter is also annoyed that some of his players would still go unrecognised down Reading High Street. \"Declan Danaher is potentially a great player and our Welsh scrum-half Darren Edwards is the equal of Gareth Cooper or Andy Williams at Bath, but Graham Henry never seems to give him a look-in. He is a star in a team that is second in the Premiership.\" Venter knows, though, that Leicester, with their England contingent back on board, will be a different proposition from an injury-racked Saracens. \"I saw them destroy Perpignan a few weeks ago and they are a mightily impressive team - still the yardstick by which we judge ourselves.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
