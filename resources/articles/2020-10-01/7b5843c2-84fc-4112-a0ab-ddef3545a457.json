He played with such joy'", "bodyText": "Jack Grealish mentions it as an after-thought, bringing it up in a matter-of-fact manner, cool Brummie tones somehow amplifying the nonchalance. \u201cIt was actually a weird one,\u201d the Aston Villa captain says. \u201cI had a fitness test on the day of the Liverpool game [last Sunday]. I hadn\u2019t even trained for the two days before it because I had a sore hamstring. I didn\u2019t expect to play the way I did.\u201d Grealish rolled his socks down, sauntered out, scored two, set three up, twisted the blood of the Liverpool defenders and drove his team to a wild 7-2 victory. He has carried the confidence on to international duty. Making his first England start in Thursday\u2019s 3-0 friendly win over Wales at Wembley, he was the game\u2019s outstanding performer, creating the opening goal for Dominic Calvert-Lewin and, more broadly, drifting into spaces, running with the ball, getting his team playing. The 25-year-old says that he does not obsess about his diet; he does not work on those bulging calf muscles and he does not care where he plays. He just plays. And when everything clicks, as it has done so far this season, the sense of excitement and possibility is tangible. England need a midfielder like Grealish, a player to break the lines, to get up the pitch, maybe to win a free-kick, to make something happen. The question is whether Gareth Southgate can accommodate him. The manager does not use a No 10 in his 3-4-3 or 4-3-3 systems and he has said that he does not see Grealish as a No 8. Which leaves him fighting it out for one of the wide forward spots, where England have genuine strength in Raheem Sterling, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford. Southgate played Grealish off the left in a 3-4-3 against Wales, in what was an inexperienced and experimental line-up. Although Sterling is injured, Sancho and Rashford hope to return for Sunday\u2019s glamour Nations League tie against Belgium at Wembley. \u201cI had a long chat with the manager in the last camp,\u201d Grealish says, with a nod towards the September internationals when he made his debut as a substitute in the 0-0 draw against Denmark. \u201cHe\u2019s good for that, he lets you speak your mind. I said to him: \u2018I see myself playing as No 8 for England, as No 10, as a left-winger or right-winger.\u2019 Wherever I am on the pitch, I will play. I couldn\u2019t care less where I play. \u201cThere is so much talent in the wing positions and it will be difficult to get into those positions. I have full respect for those guys and the numbers they have got. But I also have respect for how much ability I have got. In the last two or three years, I have played half my games on the wing and half my games as a No 8 or No 10. I fully believe that I can do both going forward. I think the manager knows that now.\u201d Grealish does not appear to want for self-assurance but he can tell the story of when, aged 15, he passed out because of nerves at an England trial. \u201cI woke up in the middle of the night, I went to go to the toilet and my roommate, who was Diego Poyet, Gus Poyet\u2019s son, heard a bang and then I just woke up in the bathroom,\u201d Grealish says. \u201cI had obviously collapsed. I didn\u2019t want to go home the following day but England said they thought it was best that I did.\u201d Grealish went to play for Republic of Ireland at youth level \u2013 he qualified through his grandparents \u2013 but as he got older, in his own words and as he has said before: \u201cI realised I am English.\u201d He adds: \u201cEveryone knows one of my long-term goals was to get into the England squad and play for England. Now that I am here, I want to cement my place. I was absolutely desperate to come here.\u201d Grealish talks about how he goes \u201cwith the flow,\u201d how he tries \u201cnot to let nerves get to me\u201d or become bogged down with anything. It is all about expression and being in the right place to show that \u2013 a little like it was for Paul Gascoigne, to whom he has drawn comparisons. \u201cI would love to be like Gazza,\u201d Grealish says. \u201cHe played with such joy and that is what I want to do. One of the biggest compliments for people to say to you is that you make them happy watching football.\u201d A feature of the Wales game was how often Grealish was fouled but this is nothing new to him. Last season, he was fouled a Premier League high 177 times \u2013 Crystal Palace\u2019s Wilfried Zaha was next on 133 \u2013 and it is because he constantly demands possession and is prepared to risk it. He wants opponents to lunge in, he almost dares them to. In deeper areas, Southgate said that he saw him as a \u201cmatador\u201d with the ball as his cloak. \u201cA few of the lads said: \u2018We\u2019ve never seen anyone get kicked as much as you\u2019,\u201d Grealish says. \u201cBut I enjoy it. Getting kicked means I\u2019m doing something right.\u201d These are heady days for Grealish, with the Liverpool game, according to him, being one that \u201cdoesn\u2019t come around often in your lifetime as a footballer, it was crazy.\u201d He knows how good he can be. The quest now is for consistency. \u201cI\u2019m capable of these types of performances,\u201d Grealish says. \u201cThe aim is to do it every weekend like some of the players in this squad \u2013 Harry Kane, Raheem, Marcus. It is the standard these guys set. You only have to look at Harry Kane. He is first on the training pitch, he is first in the meetings. He is last off the training pitch, he is practising his finishing, free-kicks \u2013 every single day. No wonder he is one of the best strikers in the world. It makes you want to go back to Villa and set those standards.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
