Albion's experienced striker recorded the 200th league strike of his career before the rookie winger registered his first to earn Palace a point. It denied the FA Cup semi-finalists a return to third place and meant that, rather than celebrating Phillips' milestone, they were lamenting a defensive mishap. Phillips, 34, was recently voted the foremost player in the Football League and, while many acclaim Albion as the Championship's finest team, they may be headed for Wembley in both the FA Cup and the play-offs. It was an early indication of the two managers' differing ambitions that Neil Warnock relegated his top scorer, Clinton Morrison, to the bench, while Tony Mowbray promoted his, Phillips, to the starting line-up. Nevertheless the Palace selection permitted the precocious Moses only the fourth start of his career. With a low centre of gravity and sharp acceleration, the 17-year-old made a series of incursions into Albion territory. When chances materialised, however, they were fashioned by West Brom, with Phillips' sharpness notable from the start. He had steered one shot wide and headed into the side netting before completing his double century of goals in suitable style. Paul Robinson's pass from the left flank appeared a little underhit. Phillips was not deterred, however, a fine first touch allowing him to execute a superb second, lifted over the Palace goalkeeper, Julian Speroni, and into the net. It brought up a second landmark, with Phillips reaching the 20-goal milestone for the second season running. In the process, he breached the most frugal defence away from home in the division. Warnock's attempt to extend that record - Phillips' goal was only the 14th they have conceded on the road - entailed a back four comprised entirely of players who are, by trade, centre-backs, shielded by Shaun Derry. The merits of such a tall defence were apparent when one of their number, Mark Hudson, almost headed Palace level from Ben Watson's free-kick. Albion's susceptibility in the air was apparent again when Watson delivered a second ball and James Scowcroft headed it into the path of Moses. The teenager converted for his first senior goal, which preceded a cartwheeling celebration and then his withdrawal. Injuries then compelled Mowbray to remove Chris Brunt and then his replacement, James Morrison, with the latter lasting only five minutes. Do-Heon Kim, his deputy, attempted a shot within 20 seconds of his introduction but conceded possession to enable Palace to equalise. The changes upset Albion's rhythm until a flurry of late chances which, with Palace remaining obstinate, did not yield a winner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
