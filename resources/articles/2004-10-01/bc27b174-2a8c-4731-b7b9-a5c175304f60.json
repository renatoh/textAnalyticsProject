Indians, meanwhile, were consoling themselves with the arrival of a gifted all-rounder for whom Miller would have had high regard. If Harbhajan Singh was India's outstanding player in the 217-run defeat in the first Test, with 11 wickets in all and a hard-hit 42 runs in the second innings, he was followed closely by Irfan Pathan, who at 19 reminds many of the young Wasim Akram, the former Pakistan all-rounder who played a part in his development. At the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore, in his first home Test, Pathan's left-arm seam bowling overshadowed that of the more experienced Zaheer Khan. He also struck a vigorous lost-cause 55, including eight fours and two sixes, in the final act of the game. If England supporters feel that in Andy Flintoff they have found someone who roughly measures up to Ian Botham's standards, Indians are willing Pathan to be their new Kapil Dev. \"His focus has to be on his bowling,\" Kapil himself said yesterday. \"The runs are a bonus. Irfan is India's key bowler. There should be no pressure on him as a batsman.\" And Wasim said: \"Irfan's an all-rounder but a bowling all-rounder. His talent should be treated with care. There shouldn't be over-dependence on him to score runs.\" Imran Khan, the former Pakistan great, agreed: \"He should not be burdened with the all-rounder's tag. Let him become a complete bowler first. He's taking the new ball; let him understand the responsibility that comes with it.\" Pathan, who also has the athletic good looks to become major box-office material, made his Test debut only a year ago. But whereas there is something essentially boyish about Australia's recent debutant Michael Clarke - the 23-year-old has a poster of the captain Ricky Ponting on his bedroom wall and says one of his ambitions is to meet David Beckham - Pathan already looks a grown-up cricketer. Wasim added: \"Irfan should keep working on his fitness and shut himself from the outside world. He is not only an intelligent cricketer but seems mature as well. That's where the seniors in his team, or former India cricketers, can have a big influence. He's a star - look after him.\" But the modern game offers little time for nursemaiding. Pathan will be back in the fray here on Thursday, when the second Test begins. India's coach John Wright was in doggedly optimistic mood as his team prepared to fly into the heat and humidity of the city long known as Madras. \"We can bounce back in what will be a very important game,\" he said. \"I was disappointed with the result but not with the commitment and attitude of the team. It was closer than it seemed. The really encouraging thing is that when the ball spun we bowled them out for less than 250, even though Australia are better equipped to face spin bowling than they were last time. \"Our recent Test successes have been built around big first-innings scores. The boys just need to get their rhythm going. They've played a lot of one-day cricket and there have also been some weather problems.\" It looks as though India will have to compile those big scores without the assistance of Sachin Tendulkar, however, because he is unlikely to have recovered from tennis elbow in time. Indeed, there is now speculation that his condition has been underestimated and that he may miss the entire series."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
