As chairman of British Airways, he is just the kind of corporate big-hitter the club's banker, Royal Bank of Scotland, who insisted on his appointment, needs to keep Liverpool's owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett, in line. Provided, that is, he has the time. For, once the ongoing merger between BA and Iberia is concluded, he will also sit as the deputy chair of the board of the consolidated International Airlines Group. Meanwhile this horse racing, golf and football lover is also the deputy president of the Confederation of British Industries. Given that cornucopia of commitments, it is interesting that BA are leading the opposition to changes to rules governing the time that nonexecutive directors must give to their posts. In a letter last October to the Financial Reporting Council \u2013 whose Combined Code on Corporate Governance has been under review by Sir David Walker \u2013 BA's company secretary, Alan Buchanan, stated: \"We do not support Walker's recommendation that nonexecutive directors should make a minimum expected time commitment.\" Walker wanted a bare minimum of at least six working weeks' worth of hours to be given over to each nonexecutive post (with chairmanships presumably, in the spirit of it, requiring rather more). But his proposal was overruled, leaving Broughton free to take over at Anfield. With all that on his plate one thing is for sure: he'll never walk alone. Foundation crumbling One of football's great success stories of recent years, the Football Foundation, looks set to lay off staff after coming under pressure from its funding partners over strategy and finance. The organisation's community section will be axed amid fears its work duplicates that of the Football Association and the Premier League. Although there are hopes that the three staff whose posts are under threat can be repositioned within the foundation, redundancies have not been ruled out. The foundation is labouring under the decline in its guaranteed income streams after the FA told it that \u00a34m of its payments this year would have to be deferred following the collapse of Setanta. With the FA reducing its commitment, its fellow trustees \u2013 government and the Premier League \u2013 are expected to follow suit. Lib Dems get radical With Man United Man being wooed by both the government and the opposition ahead of the general election, with their promises to extend supporter ownership, what of the Liberal Democrats? \"It's a nice idea but it will be nothing more than a pipe dream for most fans,\" a spokesman told Digger. So is there nothing the visionary Nick Clegg can offer football supporters? Not so, apparently. \"We are the only party looking to introduce safe standing at football grounds \u2013 we would change the regulations that currently prevent football stadiums from providing safe-standing areas if they can meet stringent safety requirements.\" And that is not all, apparently: \"A radical overhaul of the FA is essential so that it better represents supporters and acts in the interests of the game.\" Radical indeed. Pini playing matchmaker? David Lampitt's job-switch from the FA's head of financial regulation to Portsmouth's chief executive was certainly out of left field, although on the face of it there are some dots that can be joined. About 18 months ago Lampitt was spotted in a London nightclub having dinner with the agent Pini Zahavi, whose long association with Pompey continues. Zahavi has been a regular guest in the Fratton Park directors' box and accompanied the Pompey delegation to Wembley on Sunday. But he says he has by no means been Lampitt's sponsor for the Pompey job. Both the agent and the FA say the nightclub meeting was to discuss the Quest inquiry's findings in transfers involving Zahavi. Perhaps Lampitt just sent in his CV."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
