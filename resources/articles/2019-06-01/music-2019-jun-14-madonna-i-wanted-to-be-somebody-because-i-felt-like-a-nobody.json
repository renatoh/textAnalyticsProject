She is still promoting her eponymous debut album, released six months before, and still just one among a raft of young singers mining a vein of post-disco dance-pop. She has yet to have a Top 10 hit in the United States, and the host, Dick Clark, still finds it necessary to explain who she is when introducing her. Her label\u2019s expectations for the single she performs, Holiday, are so modest, it hasn\u2019t bothered commissioning a video for it. And yet it\u2019s not just hindsight that makes the viewer realise something big is about to happen to her career. After she mimes to Holiday, the audience won\u2019t stop screaming and cheering: Clark has to plead for quiet so he can interview her. Answering his questions, Madonna is funny and flirtatious and very, very confident. He asks her what her ambitions are. \u201cTo rule the world,\u201d she answers. Thirty-five years on, Madonna laughs when I mention it. \u201cYes,\u201d she nods. \u201cSorry for saying that.\u201d The thing is, she says, she wasn\u2019t confident at all back then: it was all a front. \u201cI may have been insecure, I may have felt like a nobody, but I knew I had to do something. If I was going to make something out of my life, I had to, you know, hurl myself into the dark space, go down the road less travelled. Otherwise, why live?\u201d She recalls feeling as startled as anyone else when she realised how famous she had become, less than 18 months after she had informed Clark she was going to rule the world. The Like a Virgin album had come out and sold 3.5m copies in 14 weeks in the US alone. She had scored six transatlantic Top 10 hit singles in under a year. Desperately Seeking Susan was in cinemas: her presence as the titular heroine had turned a low-budget film packed with cameos from New York underground luminaries \u2013 Richard Hell, Arto Lindsay, Ann Magnuson \u2013 into a box-office smash. No one was talking about her being just one among a raft of young post-disco dance-pop singers any more. \u201cIt took my breath away. I can\u2019t begin to tell you. I remember the first concert I did on the Virgin tour, in Seattle, when everything became big and I had no way of being prepared for it. It literally sucked the life out of me, sucked the air out of my lungs when I walked on stage. I sort of had an out-of-body experience. Not a bad feeling, not an out-of-control feeling, but an otherworldly feeling that nothing could prepare you for. I mean,\u201d she smiles, \u201ceventually you get used to it.\u201d You clearly do. The Madonna that sits before me, perched on an overstuffed sofa in a swish hotel not far from the house she owns in central London, certainly doesn\u2019t give the impression of being a woman terribly plagued by insecurity: a solitary wobble comes when talk turns to her then-forthcoming appearance on Eurovision, a venerable television institution almost unknown in the US and that, it quickly becomes apparent, Madonna has never actually seen. \u201cWell, Jean-Paul Gaultier is obsessed with it,\u201d she shrugs. Her unexpected, apparently unresearched and ultimately divisive plunge into the world of Ding-a-Dong, Dana International and nul points pour le Royaume-Uni notwithstanding, she radiates starry self-assurance. And why wouldn\u2019t she? A list of her achievements in the intervening 35 years includes becoming the bestselling female artist ever, the most successful solo artist in the history of the American charts, the highest-grossing solo touring artist ever and, as she dryly notes, \u201cstill being alive\u201d, her only real competition for the title of most legendary pop artist of her era, Michael Jackson and Prince, having both prematurely passed away. Sometimes when she talks, she unmistakably sounds like a pop star forged in a different era. She is \u201cdizzy\u201d at the sheer turnover of pop in the digital age \u2013 \u201cThere are so many distractions, so much noise, so many people coming and going so quickly, it takes away the artist\u2019s ability to grow\u201d \u2013 and says the modern way of writing pop songs, where artists are thrown together with a rotating cast of random star producers and writers at songwriting camps, didn\u2019t suit her at all. \u201cOh, I tried that on MDNA and Rebel Heart. I worked with a lot of talented people, but it\u2019s too hard to have a vision when you work with so many people: there\u2019s so much input. I didn\u2019t enjoy the process at all. Sometimes it was great, but it\u2019s very weird to sit in a room with strangers and go: \u2018OK, on your marks, set, write a song together!\u2019 You have to reveal yourself, you have to be vulnerable, and it\u2019s hard to do that right away.\u201d She says the person she had the best experience with in the writing camps was Avicii, the Swedish EDM star who killed himself in April 2018. \u201cI called his group of writers the Viking Harem \u2013 all these six-foot gorgeous blond men. I thought we wrote a lot of great songs together, but many of them never got finished. For a minute there, I felt like I was having that moment with one group of people, but then that switched, then it switched again and then it switched again. I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d Nevertheless, uniquely among her peers, she is still resolutely a pop artist, still making music informed by what is happening in the charts and the clubs. These days, she sometimes learns about it via her 13-year-old daughter, Mercy, an \u201curban queen\u201d whose taste in hip-hop apparently sits badly with her Elton John-loving brother, David: \u201cHe says the lyrics degrade women, and he\u2019s right.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing forced about it,\u201d she says of her continuing quest to personify pop. \u201cThis is the music that I listen to in my house, this is the music that inspires me. Oh, you\u2019re not allowed to make youthful, fun, sexy music if you\u2019re a certain age? That\u2019s a load of\u201d \u2013 she dips into an English accent \u2013 \u201cbollocks, to speak your language.\u201d And, whatever ups and downs her career has taken, she very much belongs to a select band of stars so impossibly famous that interviewing her is, by default, a discombobulating experience. Not because she\u2019s difficult or unpleasant in any way; far from it. There\u2019s no mistaking a certain don\u2019t-mess steeliness, but she\u2019s thoughtful and engaging. It\u2019s just that she\u2019s her. As she talks, I keep catching myself thinking: bloody hell, that\u2019s Madonna. This state of affairs is compounded by the fact that she has turned up dressed as, well, Madonna, or rather Madonna as Madame X, the persona she inhabits on her new album, complete with the same bejewelled eyepatch that will subsequently cause Graham Norton to congratulate her for appearing at Eurovision \u201cdespite clearly suffering from a terrible case of conjunctivitis\u201d. Madame X is apparently \u201ca secret agent, travelling around the world, bringing light to dark places, a spy in the house of love, curious, hungry for knowledge, wants to wake people up\u201d. The album itself is a lot of things that fans want a Madonna album to be: provocative, personal, political, funny, quite eccentric and, as she puts it, \u201ccheeky\u201d, a charmingly decorous way of describing the lyrical content of Bitch I\u2019m Loca, a track that ends with her urging the Colombian singer Maluma to \u201cput it inside\u201d. It reunites her with Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef, the French producer who worked on her two undisputed latterday classics \u2013 2000\u2019s Music and 2005\u2019s Confessions on a Dancefloor \u2013 and serves up an eclectic grab-bag of mumble rap, reggae, post-Despacito Latin pop, pounding hi-NRG, an electronic version of Dance of the Reed Pipes from Tchaikovsky\u2019s Nutcracker, and fado, the latter influenced by her relocation to Lisbon two years ago. She \u201c100% moved there only for David\u201d \u2013 he plays football for Benfica\u2019s youth academy \u2013 and initially endured \u201ca few months of lonely anguish, not really knowing anyone, not speaking Portuguese, trying to figure out how to fit in that world and make my children comfortable\u201d, before making friends and being drawn into the city\u2019s music scene. She talks enthusiastically about house parties \u201cwhere you can\u2019t move for musicians playing fado\u201d and tiny bars without music licences where audiences are forbidden to clap the performers \u201cso you have to rub your hands together as a sign of applause, which is pretty cool\u201d. The lyrics, meanwhile, variously touch on school shootings, the sitting US president, the decline in the value of celebrity, and sexual abuse and harassment. She\u2019s not sure why the music industry hasn\u2019t yet had a #MeToo moment to rival Hollywood\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same \u2013 there are people abusing their power everywhere, in all areas of life, not just film and not just music. A musical artist is allowed to speak in a more personal way and be themselves and talk about issues in a way that say, an actor is not; they don\u2019t have a voice, the voice and the opinions belong to the director or the studios. And if you\u2019re a movie star and you want a part in a movie, there are a lot of people, mostly men, who are willing to exploit and abuse that power to degrade women. And they\u2019re untouchable.\u201d She has recently spoken of how Harvey Weinstein was \u201cincredibly sexually flirtatious\u201d with her and \u201ccrossed lines and boundaries\u201d when they worked together on 1991 tour documentary In Bed With Madonna. \u201cHarvey Weinstein was untouchable. His reputation was universal \u2013 everybody knew he was, you know, the guy that he was. I\u2019m not into name-calling, but it was like: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s Harvey, that\u2019s what he does.\u2019 It just became accepted. And I suppose that\u2019s the scary thing about it. Because if people do things enough, no matter how heinous and awful and unacceptable it is, people accept it. And that certainly exists in the music industry, too.\u201d She came up against it herself in the years when she was trying to get a record deal. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many men said: \u2018OK, well, if you give me a blow job\u2019, or: \u2018OK, if you sleep with me.\u2019 Sex is the trade, you know? I feel like maybe there isn\u2019t a movement so much because we\u2019re already used to expressing ourselves in a way, or fighting for things, although I do wish there were more women in the music business that were more political and more outspoken about all things in life, not just \u2026 the inequality of the sexes.\u201d My time is nearly up, and our conversation turns back to the old American Bandstand footage of an ambitious 25-year-old. She says she still has ambitions: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve just put a record out, so I must still have ambitions. Yes, I want to be successful, I am ambitious. Yes!\u201d But you\u2019ve been as successful as a pop star can ever hope to be \u2013 does that not curb your hunger a bit? She frowns. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think my ambition has ever really been generated by what you maybe perceive as conventional success. I mean, being super-famous or super-rich was never my goal.\u201d Hang on a minute: you said you wanted to rule the world. \u201cWhen I said I wanted to rule the world, I didn\u2019t say: \u2018I want to be the most famous person in the world.\u2019 I didn\u2019t say: \u2018I want to be the richest person in the world.\u2019 I said I wanted to rule the world.\u201d She thinks for a moment. \u201cWell, what did I mean then, in my very young mind? I think I just meant I want to make a mark on the world, I want to be a somebody. Because I grew up feeling like a nobody, and I wanted to make a difference. I think that\u2019s what I meant.\u201d And with a handshake, she\u2019s off, or rather, I\u2019m off: politely ushered from the room, while Madonna sits on the sofa, immaculate, still sporting her eyepatch, looking as much like a somebody as it\u2019s possible to imagine a human being looking. \u2022 Madame X is out now, on Live Nation/Interscope/Maverick"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
