Answer: A New Zealander. The Ocker stereotype that's perpetuated by jokes like this doesn't only apply to people. Ask most consumers to describe a typical Aussie wine and I suspect the words 'full-flavoured', 'unsubtle' and 'in your face' would come close to the top of the list. Producers Down Under should shoulder some of the blame for this. 'Sunshine in a glass', '75cl of fun' and 'bottles that appeal to the heart rather than the head' are all descriptions I've heard them apply to their own wines. But that's only part of the story. Taste the best cool-climate whites and reds from the Eden Valley, Coonawarra, Tumbarumba, Geelong, Canberra, the Yarra Valley, Pemberton and the Mornington Peninsula and you'll find a very different set of aromas and flavours. The popular perception may be otherwise, but Australia can do subtlety, elegance and restraint as well as almost anyone. Dr Andrew Pirie, a former academic with a frighteningly large brain, has been preaching this gospel since the early Seventies. That's when he set up his first vineyard in the north-east corner of Tasmania, an island that was famous as a lowest-of-the-low penal colony but was almost unknown as a source of decent wine. Even when I visited in the early Nineties, the place was struggling to establish itself. As Pirie told me then: 'We make at least one very good wine each year, but we never know which one it's going to be.' A lot of the island's production was more miss than hit. High acidity, lean flavours (particularly for reds) and lack of concentration were frequent criticisms. I said so in a piece and received rude middle-of-the-night faxes from an aggrieved producer in the Tamar Valley for years. I was partly put off returning by the prospect of bumping into my accuser, but only partly. The bigger drawback was that, excluding the odd sparkling wine, I wasn't that impressed by the Tasmanian wines that came my way. But travelling from one end of the island to the other recently, I was forced to change my mind. It might be the result of climate change or the fact that a lot of the vineyards are older and more established, but Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir all have a bright future here. I even had an impressive Cabernet Sauvignon, a grape that used to struggle in Tasmania's climate, at Domaine A in the Coal River Valley. Andrew Pirie is still living and working in Tasmania. In fact, he's in charge of the island's biggest producer, Tamar Ridge. He resisted the temptation to say 'I told you so' when I saw him (he's far too cultured for that), but he's clearly proud of what has happened over the past 15 years. 'As consumers become more sophisticated,' he smiled, 'they are moving towards more elegant styles.' If so, Tasmania is increasingly in a position to supply them. Three wines that stand out for me are the intense, gooseberry-scented, New Zealand-like 2007 Tasmania Sauvignon Blanc, Tamar Ridge Estates (\u00a37.99, 13%, Marks &amp; Spencer), the honeyed, refreshing, stylishly oaked 2006 The Society's Exhibition Tasmanian Chardonnay, Freycinet (\u00a39.95, 14%, The Wine Society, 01438 740 222) and the youthful, structured, multi-dimensional, Burgundian-style 2005 Apsley Gorge Pinot Noir, East Coast (\u00a315.42, 14%, Justerini &amp; Brooks, 020 7484 6400). These are all excellent, but Tasmania's strongest suit is its sparkling wines. Piper's Brook, Clover Hill, Jansz, Pirie and especially Bay of Fires (owned by Hardys) are all worth seeking out. Try the fresh, strawberryish, all Pinot Noir 2005 Clover Hill Ros\u00e9 (\u00a316.99, Oddbins) or the dry, attractively toasty Jansz Premium NV (\u00a310.99, Oddbins). Ockers might frown upon them, but frankly, who cares? \u00b7 tim.atkin@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
