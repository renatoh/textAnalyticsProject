Neither of them mentions my trousers, so I make a mental note to burn them when I get home. The three of us are meeting in a central London hotel and although outside it is dark and rainy, the two of them, in little black dresses and black high heels, are as golden and glossy as a pair of show ponies on a summer\u2019s day. I, on the other hand, have rain-soaked hair and at least one surplus stone in post-partum weight. But Aniston and Witherspoon will not be swayed from their lovebombing (\u201cI love the Guardian!\u201d \u2013 Witherspoon). It is a supremely girly way of easing into an interview, engaging in the female lingua franca of insistently complimenting another woman. If it weren\u2019t for the fact there are three PRs in the room with us \u2013 one next to Aniston, two next to Witherspoon \u2013 I could almost believe that we were just three gals, hanging out for giggles on a Friday afternoon. The actual reason we are hanging out today is to discuss Aniston and Witherspoon\u2019s extremely shiny new television series, The Morning Show, in which they both star, and produce \u2013 it\u2019s very much the showpiece of the new streaming service, Apple TV+. It is the first time the women have worked together since playing sisters on Friends, and, as all the press releases excitedly emphasise, it is the first TV show Aniston has committed to since the sitcom that made her a star. The two women have stayed friends since playing Rachel and Jill Greene \u2013 \u201cJen throws an amazing Christmas party!\u201d \u201cI do love entertaining!\u201d \u201cAnd you\u2019re so good at it, you need to teach me!\u201d \u2013 and stress keenly that they are hands on \u201cfrom top to bottom, from script, to casting, to the tone\u201d of The Morning Show. \u201cIt\u2019s a great partnership because I\u2019m a morning person and she\u2019s a night person,\u201d says Witherspoon. \u201cLiterally,\u201d agrees Aniston. \u201cWe literally share the responsibility together, and there\u2019s something so refreshing about that,\u201d finishes Witherspoon. Watching and listening to them talk gives a sense of their working dynamic. Witherspoon takes the conversational lead, Aniston gamely backs her up, Witherspoon makes the concluding statement. Bish bash done. Both women are experienced producers with their own production companies. I\u2019ve met many male producers and Aniston and Witherspoon definitely have a less macho, more personable energy than, say, Jerry Bruckheimer, and let\u2019s not even mention the Weinstein brothers (at least, not yet). \u201cWe have to change the power structures. Just the fact that she and I are producing our own material, and things are starting to get better in terms of equal gender [representation] in rooms of power, that\u2019s going to prevent a lot of workplace misconduct,\u201d says Witherspoon. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d echoes Aniston. Why it\u2019s necessary for these power structures to change, and how that started to happen, is precisely what The Morning Show is about. The series was originally envisioned as a TV drama about breakfast TV, but just as they were starting to work on it in 2017, Matt Lauer, the much-loved presenter of NBC\u2019s hugely popular breakfast programme, Today, was accused of sexual misconduct. Instead of dumping their planned programme, Aniston and Witherspoon helped to rejig the story. It now opens with the male newscaster, Mitch (Steve Carell), being accused of sexual harassment, to the horror of his long-term co-host, Alex (Aniston). \u201cSo now, instead of dancing around that subject, we were like, OK, episode one \u2013 there it is,\u201d says Witherspoon, who plays Bradley, the newscaster brought in to replace Mitch. For two decades, Lauer was one of the biggest television stars in the US. Imagine Phillip Schofield combined with Gary Lineker and Ant and Dec and you have some sense of Lauer\u2019s ubiquity and seemingly clean-cut appeal. Although Carell isn\u2019t explicitly playing Lauer on The Morning Show, he absolutely nails his onscreen all-American-dad charm and the creepy darkness beneath it. The allegations against Lauer were shocking from the start \u2013 it was said that he had a button on his desk that enabled him to lock his office door as soon as a woman entered the room \u2013 and they have only become more gothic. He has been accused of anal rape and, in his new book, Catch and Kill, the former NBC journalist Ronan Farrow says not only did network management know about Lauer\u2019s behaviour, but they killed Farrow\u2019s investigations into Harvey Weinstein out of fear that the movie producer would retaliate by exposing the truth about Lauer. NBC and Lauer \u2013 and Weinstein \u2013 deny all allegations against them. When I ask if they have read Farrow\u2019s book, Aniston points to Witherspoon and says, \u201cShe has,\u201d in a \u201cshe\u2019s the reader\u201d tone of voice. \u201cYes, and [the cover-up he describes] is so disturbing. It happens in so many industries, but hopefully that\u2019s changing,\u201d Witherspoon says. Lauer was not the only US breakfast TV host to be accused of sexual misconduct in 2017: CBS\u2019s Charlie Rose also stepped down after multiple women accused him of harassment. (Rose apologised for his \u201cinappropriate behaviour\u201d but said he did not believe all the allegations made against him were accurate.) Aniston and Witherspoon spoke to Rose\u2019s former colleague Gayle King about what the revelations felt like for her, given they sat next to each other for years. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s heartbreaking. You miss them,\u201d says Aniston. \u201cHe was a friend. And they were on air for so long and you didn\u2019t know this about your colleague\u2019s personality,\u201d says Witherspoon. The show isn\u2019t perfect. Aniston is great as the brittle TV anchor seemingly on the verge of losing her mind. But the plot is clunky and the characters\u2019 motivations are so baffling that even they seem confused by them: \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d they shout at one another. Given that the series is ostensibly about the #MeToo movement, its stakes are bewilderingly low: the show\u2019s main concern is whether a wealthy female presenter\u2019s career will suffer because of her male colleague\u2019s behaviour. Is that really the worst thing those involved can imagine happening to a woman \u2013 losing a highly paid job? Yet the show deserves credit for touching on some of the ambiguities within the #MeToo movement, such as whether a man sleazing on younger subordinates should be discussed in the same breath as an accused rapist, and how we unpick the complexities of consent when a sexual experience can be interpreted totally differently by the involved parties. \u201cThere\u2019s this absolute denial \u2013 \u2018It was consensual, it was consensual\u2019 \u2013 if you\u2019re a narcissist to the degree a lot of these guys are. They think, of course every woman wants to sleep with me,\u201d says Aniston. \u201cThis is not an echo chamber of women talking about #MeToo,\u201d says Witherspoon. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a very gender-balanced conversation because we need men watching the show. Real change doesn\u2019t happen unless the incumbent power structure accepts it.\u201d That seems a somewhat debatable point \u2013 has the patriarchy ever really accepted feminism? \u2013 but I want to talk to Witherspoon about her character in particular. One of the key moments in the series is when she realises that almost everyone knew about Mitch and she sets out to expose this culture of corporate silence. In 2017, Witherspoon revealed that she had been sexually assaulted by a director when she was 16, and was instructed by agents and producers to keep quiet about it. \u201cI wish I could tell you that was an isolated incident in my career but, sadly, it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve had multiple experiences of harassment and sexual assault,\u201d she said. She felt, she added, \u201cguilt for not speaking up earlier\u201d. I ask how it felt to play a character so fearless about revealing the kind of experiences she endured when she was younger. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that you say that. When stories [about assault and harassment] come out, I sometimes get really upset and it runs the gamut from sad to heartbroken to extreme anger. I think it probably drives me to tell more stories about it because art is the best antidote,\u201d she says. \u201cYes,\u201d adds Aniston supportively. How does she think her experiences affected her personally? \u201cIt makes me determined not to let this happen to other young women. I\u2019m so grateful to the women who spoke out about things in their past because I\u2019m in a different position, obviously, but those women had nothing to gain, and some lost their jobs over it. They are the real heroes in my mind.\u201d So does she wish she could have spoken out sooner? The temperature in the room drops palpably. \u201cUmmm no. It was a culture of silence and silence was a condition of my employment. That\u2019s what I was told,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d adds Aniston. I wouldn\u2019t normally press a woman about her experiences of sexual harassment and assault. But given that for the past 20 minutes we have been talking about the importance of talking about sexual assault allegations and cover-ups, and the courage of women who speak up, I am surprised that Witherspoon is shutting down any discussion of her experiences with aphorisms about art. Perhaps I\u2019m asking the wrong questions. I try again: are the people who harassed her or told her to stay silent still working in the entertainment industry? The room goes sub-Arctic. \u201cUmmmmm no,\u201d Witherspoon eventually says. She shoots a frowny-smiley face towards her PRs. \u201cI think we\u2019ll move on now, OK?\u201d one of them says firmly to me. Aniston is looking at me dazed, as if shocked that I\u2019ve broken some code. I feel a little as if I am about to be ejected from the cool girls\u2019 table. But it\u2019s fine. We\u2019re all professionals, so we move on to Harvey Weinstein, a less controversial subject, given that everyone agrees he is Bad. He distributed Witherspoon\u2019s 2002 film The Importance of Being Earnest and produced Aniston\u2019s 2005 film Derailed. \u201cI was never alone in a room with him,\u201d says Aniston. \u201cI was never alone with him either. But I didn\u2019t know why,\u201d adds Witherspoon. \u201cMe neither. But always someone would stand in the room,\u201d Aniston echoes. \u201cNow I look back and I\u2019m very grateful to those people who stayed in the room with me. What they knew, I don\u2019t know,\u201d says Witherspoon. Witherspoon, 43, and Aniston, 50, have been hugely famous for more than half their lives, with the former shooting to fame in the 90s teen film Cruel Intentions when she was 23, and the latter becoming a TV icon at 25 in Friends. Probably the most fun part of The Morning Show is watching Aniston show, through her character, how being in the spotlight can drive a woman to near breaking point. \u201cThere is something very interesting about being a public person and playing a public person and incorporating those challenges and bringing them out into the open,\u201d she agrees. Few modern celebrities have been more in the white-hot light of public fascination than Aniston. Ever since the end of her marriage to Brad Pitt in 2005, she has been treated by the media and public as more of a soap opera character than an actual person, one whose life (will she have children? Will she marry again?) we can all follow breathlessly. When she joined Instagram last month, posting a photo of herself and her Friends co-stars, she caused the site to crash. Is she comfortable with the amount of exposure she has? \u201cI find it very odd,\u201d she says, leaning forward earnestly. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make sense to me. I\u2019d love for someone to break it down, but there it is and now it has to keep going.\u201d Does it control her life? \u201cNo! No, no, no,\u201d she scoffs. She admits she joined Instagram mainly to promote the show. \u201cBut also, I think I had this idea \u2026 I don\u2019t want to be the only person \u2026 Let\u2019s see, what do I want to say here?\u201d she says, with the wariness of one accustomed to having their most casual comments blown up into headlines. \u201cI thought, \u2018Why would I do this? People are already in my panty drawers all the time.\u2019 \u201cAnd I want them out of my panty drawers. But now I can decide which pair to show them.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the best thing you ever said!\u201d hoots Witherspoon. On that note, our time is up. \u201cThank you for your thoughtful questions,\u201d says Witherspoon, as if thanking me for a kidney. \u201cYes, thanks!\u201d Aniston adds. And I leave them fighting for the #MeToo movement, within their limits. The Morning Show is on Apple TV+."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
