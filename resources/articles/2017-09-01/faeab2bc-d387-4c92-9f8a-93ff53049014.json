It\u2019s been, in its way, actually quite exciting. Bye! Final score in the shoot-out: Burnley 3-5 Leeds United! Dallas shoots to his left, Pope dives to his left, and Leeds United are through! Burnley 3-4 Leeds United! Alioski\u2019s penalty is an absolute cracker, flying right into the top corner! MISS! Burnley 3-3 Leeds United! Tarkowski\u2019s shot is low, his shot is hard, and his shot hits Lonergan and bounces clear! We have our first miss! Burnley 3-3 Leeds United! The keeper goes the right way, but Brady\u2019s penalty is too good! Burnley 2-3 Leeds United! Klich\u2019s penalty is ice-cool, casually passed to his right as the keeper goes left! Burnley 2-2 Leeds United! Hern\u00e1ndez, who scored Leeds\u2019s penalty in normal time, sends his effort just inside the right-hand post! Burnley 2-1 Leeds United! Barnes sidefoots to his right, with Pope diving the wrong way. Wood scores from the spot! Burnley 1-1 Leeds United Chris Wood slams the ball straight down the middle, and into the roof of the net! It\u2019s in! Burnley 0-1 Leeds United Smashed hard into the left corner. Pope goes the right way but gets nowhere near. Penalties are about to get under way, and Lasogga is going to take the first for Leeds. There\u2019s some unhappiness among the Leeds ranks at Burnley, where the police appear to have requested that the shoot-out take place at the home end. Final score: Burnley 2-2 Leeds United So this tie will be decided by penalty kicks. Final score: Wolves 1-0 Bristol Rovers Bright Enobakhare wins the game, and the best-first-name-of-the-night award. Final score: Bournemouth 1-0 Brighton It\u2019s all over at the Vitality, and Bournemouth are through. David Hytner has spent his evening at Wembley: And Wolves still lead Bristol Rovers 1-0, where the visitors\u2019 Tom Lockyer has been sent off for a professional foul. In Bournemouth they\u2019re into added time at the end of extra time, and the Cherries remain a goal to the good. Another update from Burnley-focused JR: \u201cA possible source of controversy at Burnley would be referee Darren Bond pulling six added minutes out of his pants (it should not have been more than four) and then Brady equalising in the 96th minute,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut what a free kick that was. Love Brady. Anyway, if nuclear armageddon arrives before I contact you again at least we had Sako/Sakho/Sacko day.\u201d Tonight has been unusually Sakful. There are, it seems, only two top-level footballing Sakhos in world football, and just one Sako (though Yuya Osako plays for K\u00f6ln, Abdoulaye Sissako for Auxerre and Vajebah Sakor for Gothenburg). There\u2019s only one renowned Sacko, unless you count Falaye Sacko of Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es. In short, every single noteworthy Sacko/Sakho/Sako in world football has been in Carabao Cup action tonight. The three extra-time matches continue, and are all in the second half. Wolves and Bournemouth lead 1-0, while Burnley and Leeds remain tied at 2-2, and are presumably saving themselves for a ludicrously manic last two minutes. Finally (for now), Jacob Steinberg witnessed West Ham\u2019s comfortable romp against Bolton: While Stuart James saw Leicester\u2019s logic-busting victory over Liverpool. According to our occasionally-reliable match stats, Leicester had eight shots in total of which five were on target, while Liverpool had 21 shots in total of which three were on target. That is some commitment to profligacy: Some match reports for you. First, Dominic Fifield watched Crystal Palace beat Huddersfield: Final score: Tottenham 1-0 Barnsley It\u2019s all over at Wembley, and Tottenham are still in the hat! Could they be on their way to Wembley (again)? Jon Fanning has got an issue with JR\u2019s Burnley v Leeds report, and specifically the suggestion that Jeff Hendrick has been \u201cliterally invisible\u201d. \u201cIf he is literally invisible at Turf Moor, I suspect it is more likely he isn\u2019t there at all and they are just pretending he is,\u201d he writes, not unreasonably. After battling through 90 goalless minutes, and some goalless stoppage time, within moments of extra time getting under way it\u2019s \u2026 GOAL! Wolves 1-0 Bristol Rovers (Enobakhare, 98 mins) and also GOAL! Bournemouth 1-0 Brighton (King, 99 mins) I meant I didn\u2019t see what it was doing there stylistically, though I hadn\u2019t thought of this obvious potential excuse. It has finished 2-2 at Burnley, so they, like the goalless pair, Bournemouth v Brighton and Wolves v Bristol Rovers, head into stoppage time. I certainly don\u2019t see anything very admirable in it. Is it the green stripe that gets your juices flowing? Because I\u2019ve got no idea what it\u2019s doing there. GOAL! Reading 0-2 Swansea (Ayew, 83 mins) I don\u2019t know much about this goal, except that it was \u201csuperb\u201d. GOAL! Burnley 2-2 Leeds (Brady, 90+6 mins) A totally ludicrous final few minutes at Burnley, and after Robbie Brady curls in a lovely 30-yard free kick it once again looks like extra time is inevitable there. GOALS! Brentford 1-3 Borwich (Clarke, 90 mins) West Ham 3-0 Bolton (Masuaku, 90 mins) I\u2019ve only seen the latter, which was a beautiful left-footed strike into the far top corner from 30 yards. Final score: Bristol City 2-0 Stoke City Another Premier League scalp is, um, scalped in Bristol, where Stoke played poorly and were punished for it. Final score: Leicester 2-0 Liverpool Anyone who turned off at half-time will be absolutely astonished by this scoreline. GOAL! Burnley 1-2 Leeds (Hernandez pen, 90+4 mins) It\u2019s not a great penalty, low, slow and nowhere near the corner, but happily the goalkeeper goes the wrong way, so it doesn\u2019t much matter! Penalty to Leeds! Tarkowski pulls Roofe\u2019s shirt, and in the middle of six minutes of stoppage time Leeds have a chance to retake the lead! Bad news for text-based live-update service providers everywhere: there will be extra time in at least one game, the final whistle having gone at Bournemouth. Oh yes. How quickly we forget. GOAL! Burley 1-1 Leeds (Wood pen, 89 mins) And Wood sends the goalkeeper the wrong way to haul Burnley level at the last! He celebrates with a demure fist-pump. Burnley, a goal down at home to Leeds, have a penalty in the 88th minute! And former Leeds striker Chris Wood will take it! There are now only two goalless games, at Bournemouth and Wolves. Extra time appears very likely. Hamza Choudhury has just come on for Leicester, making his first-team debut. He has the most spectacular afro. When did the top-flight last revel in a \u2019do like this? Meanwhile Gray nearly puts Leicester three goals ahead against Liverpool, his lovely curling shot being tipped round the post. GOAL! Burnley 0-1 Leeds (Sacko, 80 mins) That\u2019s an excellent long-range through-ball that sends Sacko screaming into all sorts of space in Burnley\u2019s half, and he puts Leeds ahead with 10 minutes to play! GOAL! Tottenham 1-0 Barnsley (Alli, 65 mins) Trippier bursts into the box and sends the ball bobbling across goal, where Dele Alli anticipates and taps in from six yards! GOAL! Leicester 2-0 Liverpool (Slimani, 78 mins) That is an absolute cracker from Slimani! Okazaki slips the ball into his path, and he takes a few strides towards the penalty area before slamming a beautiful left-footed shot into the top corner! More news from our temporary voluntary Burnley corresponent: \u201cAmong those wishing that Roy Keane wasn\u2019t at Turf Moor would be Jeff Hendrick, who has been literally invisible, and Kevin Long who missed the target completely with a wide open header in the first half,\u201d writes JR. \u201cOn the bright side Conor Shaughnessy looks to be doing pretty good. And look! What\u2019s this?! Yes, another Sacko (with another spelling) has entered the epic third round of the Carabao Cup! Hadi Sacko just came on for Leeds.\u201d It\u2019s a big night for returning players: after Pape Soare, Danny Ings comes on for Liverpool, replacing Wijnaldum. Oof. GOAL! Brentford 0-3 Norwich (Murphy, 68 mins) Murphy speeds onto a through-ball into the left-hand side of the area and lifts the ball gently over the advancing goalkeeper! GOAL! Reading 0-1 Swansea (Mawson, 52 mins) Mawson\u2019s shot from a Renato Sanches corner is deflected into the back of the net, and the goals are really flying in now! GOAL! Aston Villa 0-2 Middlesbrough (Bamford, 67 mins) That\u2019s a lovely long, curling, dipping cross from the left, and Bamford rises at the back stick and sends a looping header back across goal and in. GOAL! Leicester 1-0 Liverpool (Okazaki, 66 mins) Okazaki, Ulloa\u2019s replacement, scuffs the ball in from 12 yards and Liverpool, utterly dominant in the first half, are behind! GOAL! Bristol City 2-0 Stoke City (Taylor, 60 mins) A long ball is flicked on, Matty Taylor drives into the area and then shoots low across goal and in. Stoke\u2019s official Twitter feed admits the Premier League side \u201cjust haven\u2019t been at the races\u201d. Oooh! Ike Ugbo has just missed a brilliant chance to put Barnsley ahead at Spurs! GOAL! Aston Villa 0-1 Middlesbrough (Bamford pen, 58mins) Bamford strokes the penalty high and just left of centre, while the goalkeeper dives low and right. Middlesbrough have a penalty, and Aston Villa\u2019s Tommy Elphick has been sent off! \u201cPlease don\u2019t disparage goalless games. Or dull ones, or rubbish ones,\u201d weites Charles Antaki. \u201cCleave the Carabou Cup to your bosom, aware that this world may not have much time left, with nuclear Armageddon announced at the UN tonight.\u201d I get your logic, but do I really have to? GOAL! ANOTHER GOAL! Brentford 0-2 Norwich (Vrancic, 51 mins) Having scored from a penalty in the first half, Mario Vrancic scores from a free-kick in the second, sneaking it low inside the near post from 20 yards or so. In other substitution news, Pape Souare has come on at half-time for Crystal Palace, a year and a week after his car crash. Ulloa isn\u2019t fine \u2013 he\u2019s had to go off. GOAL! YES, A GOAL! Bristol City 1-0 Stoke City (Di\u00e9dhiou, 50 mins) A simple but stylishly converted header from Famara Di\u00e9dhiou, and there is a potential upset on the cards at Ashton Gate. Strange goings-on at Leicester, where Ulloa is entirely unchallenged as he heads away a corner but then crumples to the ground and stays there. He seems fine now, mind. Solanke spins, shoots and a defender slids in to block smartly. In other Liverpool news, Ben Woodburn has replaced Coutinho at half-time. \u2026 Gray scoops his effort miles over the bar. And a bit wide of the post. The game has restarted at Leicester, and the home side have an excellent free-kick shooting opportunity inside a minute. The two 8pm kick-offs have both reached half-time without a goal having been scored. The second half \u2013 which is about to start in all the 7.45pm games \u2013 can only be an improvement, surely. The half-time whistle has blown in most of the 7.45pm kick-offs. The games at Aston Villa, Bournemouth, Bristol City, Burnley, Leicester and Wolves are all goalless. Norwich at Brentford and Crystal Palace at home to Huddersfield lead 1-0, while West Ham are two goals to the good against Bolton. The two 8pm kick-offs are also both goalless. Harumph. I have just been made aware of this. Oh my god, my ears. I have just seen the free-est header-from-a-set-piece that I have ever seen. It\u2019s from a Spurs corner on the right wing, and it picks out Llorente, who is absolutely fantastic with his head but is clearly overwhelmed with agoraphobia or something, so much space is he in, and his effort goes over the bar. Coutinho\u2019s shot is terrible, and both wide and high. Liverpool have a free-kick in an excellent shooting position, with five minutes of the first half remaining. Meanwhile Swansea have had a goal disallowed at Reading. Tonight\u2019s is the first league hat-trick of Zaza\u2019s career. \u201cWatching Burnley\u2019s second string against Leeds\u2019 second string is like \u2026 well, it\u2019s like something. Burnley\u2019s second stringers look more likely to score,\u201d reports JR. \u201cThe only things to report are Phil Bardsley has taken three very stupid, bad, and ultimately futile shots from way outside the box and the Leeds fans seem to be enjoying themselves a lot by abusing Charlie Taylor.\u201d Talking of West Ham and goals, a former Hammers flop is making headlines elsewhere tonight \u2013 Simone Zaza has scored an eight-minute hat-trick for Valencia against Malaga. His side are 4-0 up, with 25 minutes to play. GOAL! West Ham 2-0 Bolton (Sakho, 31 mins) A pull-back from the left and Sakho sidefoots smartly across goal and in at the back stick. More penalty action at Griffin Park. The clearest of silly sliding fouls, and the wildest of wild penalty misses. Liverpool\u2019s ability to miss chances continues to astound. Coutinho brings the ball to the edge of the area, Solanke\u2019s shot rebounds to Robertson, and he drives low across goal. Somehow it misses everybody and goes out the other side for a goal kick. Liverpool are 7-1 up on shots at present. Gray had Leicester\u2019s shot, running the length of the field after a Liverpool corner before shooting gently down the middle of goal. Liverpool miss another chance, Robertson\u2019s lovely cross being spooned over the bar at the far post by Solanke. It is extremely inconsiderate for the same club to employ both Sako and Sakho, and there should be something in the regulations to prevent them both being on the field simultaneously. Liverpool seem to be having much the better of things at Leicester, but remain goalless. Oxlade-Chamberlain wasted their latest effort, blasting wide from an unpromising position on the right. It was, I\u2019m informed, a Bakary Sako header from an Andros Townsend corner. GOAL! Crystal Palace 1-0 Huddersfield (Sako, 13 mins) I can\u2019t tell you much more about this, except that it has happened. GOAL! Brentford 0-1 Norwich (Vrancic pen, 10 mins) Watkins is fouled in the penalty area, and Mario Vrancic scores from the spot! At Leicester, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Solanke both go close, the former leading to a corner and the latter from the corner. Neither effort goes in, though. GOAL! West Ham 1-0 Bolton (Ogbonna, 4 mins) West Ham take a free-kick from the right wing, send in a lovely cross and Ogbonna thumps in the most emphatic of headers. On foreign shores, Barcelona are kicking off at 10pm. Mad crazy Spaniards with their late-night antics. We have a kick-off situation. I repeat, we have a kick-off situation. The teams are out (except where there are 8pm kick-offs) and we\u2019re about to get some actual action to chat about! One further headline, courtesy of Tony Bartholemew: \u201cBONG! There\u2019s a bloke in the Brighton line-up called Bong.\u201d Indeed, and with Bong and Skalak next to each other on the team sheet, tonight would seem a perfect opportunity for the Brighton fans to go the full Apache Indian. J\u00fcrgen Klopp talks about Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain: I don\u2019t care about his best position. I don\u2019t want to see him always on one wing or something like this. I don\u2019t want to see him fixed in his position. It\u2019s football. You have to be very flexible, and that\u2019s what I expect from him in the long term. Today he will start for the first time, and that\u2019s another thing I\u2019m excited about. A pretty strong Spurs side, with Juan Foyth making his full debut.
