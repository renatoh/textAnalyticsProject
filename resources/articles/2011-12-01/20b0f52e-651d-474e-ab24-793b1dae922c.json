It's been a watershed year for the music industry. The line between music access and ownership is blurring now that you can listen to whatever music you want, wherever you are. We've seen a big psychological shift with the realisation that you don't need to own music, that your musical universe can be blown wide open by not only having all of your tunes at your fingertips, but that of your friends, your favourite artist, that person you met backpacking in 2004, haven't seen in three years but can see in real time that they're loving a bit of Baxter Dury. Music forms such an important part of people's lives and to be given the power to discover, share and enjoy an unlimited amount \u2013 that's hugely powerful. 2011 will be remembered as the year that music subscription services began coming into their own. \u2022 What was your best and worst moment? My best moment has to be Spotify's roll out in the US. Watching all the buzz in the hours and days after we pushed the button, in what is the world's biggest music market, was amazing. I'm still recovering, mind you. Linked to the US launch, my worst moment was probably explaining to my three year old that yes, I was going to be in New York for another week - but he soon perked up when he heard he'd be getting a fleet of toy fire engines as compensation. \u2022 What's your hot tip for 2012? The Spotify Platform (shameless plug alert). We've already got some fantastic apps on offer but I think people are going to be surprised at just what's possible. Some of the stuff we have in the pipeline has been blowing the minds of people here. 2011 has been a big year for us, but 2012 is going to be a whole lot of fun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
