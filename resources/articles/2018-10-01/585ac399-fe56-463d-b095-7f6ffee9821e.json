The opposition intensified its calls to extend the commission, which is due to hand down its final findings in February next year. An interim report released last week found a culture of \u201cgreed\u201d had led to misconduct. The government has maintained it will consider extending the inquiry at the request of the commissioner, Kenneth Hayne, who has so far not indicated a desire for a later deadline. But Labor has called for more people to be given a platform to tell their story, with just 27 customers appearing in person at the commission, from the more than 10,000 customers who made written submissions. Hayne made it clear at the opening of the commission that each submission would be read, but the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said it was not enough. \u201cAll of the hearings of the commission have been in just three capital cities \u2013 regional and rural customers have not had a sufficient chance to have their say in this process,\u201d he said. \u201cMisconduct in the financial services sector is a national issue and Australians across the country deserve their chance to be heard.\u201d The roundtables will be led by Labor\u2019s shadow financial services minister, Clare O\u2019Neil. Nationals senator John Williams, a longtime advocate for the royal commission within the Coalition party room, has also called for the inquiry to be extended. Labor\u2019s announcement comes as Scott Morrison and his ministry continue to face down Labor\u2019s attacks highlighting that the government voted down the royal commission 26 times before Morrison, as then treasurer, announced it as a \u201cregrettable but necessary action\u201d in November last year. On Sunday, Morrison told the ABC that he was \u201cnot going to lecture the royal commissioner about how they should do their job\u201d and if Hayne wanted more time, the government would consider it, but he said Labor\u2019s attempts to extend the inquiry were purely political in nature. \u201cThe royal commissioner Hayne has made a number of comments about this,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is, I think, trying to very carefully balance ensuring that he gets to the issues \u2013 and I think he\u2019s been doing a very good job at that \u2013 over 9,000 submissions and pieces of communication and all of that has been gone over by the royal commission in coming to their views to where they\u2019ve expressed them today. \u201cBut he\u2019s also highlighted the need to deal with these issues to ensure that you can maintain stability and confidence in the economy and the banking system and so on.\u201d Labor has previously called for draft recommendations made by the commission to be released while the inquiry was still going, to better consult with the sector about how any reforms would feasibly be applied. The royal commission cannot change laws or lay charges, with its powers limited to recommendations the government and relevant authorities can choose whether or not to accept. Morrison said the government had already sought to act in a lot of areas the commission had examined. \u201cKicking banking executives out of the banking industry when they\u2019ve been doing the wrong thing is the regulation that I introduced and passed through the parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s good regulation and Apra needed to increase its attention on those sorts of duties. Now Asic, I think, has been found wanting and I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve made the change in Asic in its leadership. I\u2019m glad that we\u2019ve got James Shipton in there, I\u2019m glad that we\u2019ve increased its powers, its penalties, its resources and in particular its focus on prosecution, with Dan Crennan in there as, effectively, the chief prosecutor [of Asic].\u201d O\u2019Neil plans on beginning the tour this week, with travel to be paid through the usual parliamentary travel expenses regime. But she and Labor are limited by the tight timeframe the commission has set for additional submissions on its interim report, which closes at the end of the month, with O\u2019Neil also required to attend the two-week October parliamentary sitting. The royal commission will re-convene next month, with the focus shifting to policy questions arising from the first six rounds of hearings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
