Demarai Gray, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Dominic Solanke are set to join a senior squad already denied six of the manager\u2019s original selections by injury after Friday\u2019s European Under-21 Championship qualifier in Ukraine. Southgate prefers to blood them rather than turn to players such as Daniel Sturridge, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jermain Defoe. Danny Drinkwater, with whom the manager spoke this week after England\u2019s midfield options were reduced, declined a call-up, citing a lack of match fitness. The Chelsea midfielder has played only 22 minutes as a substitute in the Premier League since his \u00a335m summer move from Leicester City; he arrived hampered by a calf injury, which he aggravated in a late appearance off the bench in Sunday\u2019s victory over Manchester United. Drinkwater was unable to complete the post-match warm-down on the pitch at Stamford Bridge and has been limited to light training in the period since, meaning he has been injured for, or withdrawn from, all of Southgate\u2019s squads. \u201cHe felt he wasn\u2019t ready yet to play at this level,\u201d said the manager. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to cover the ground, you\u2019ve got to feel you are in peak physical condition. If Danny didn\u2019t feel he was ready for that, I can understand. He\u2019s not been fit for the last three camps. You can\u2019t do anything about that. \u201cI\u2019d say there are quite a few places in the squad [for the World Cup] still up for grabs. There are players who have played pretty consistently for us and made big contributions, but then there are a group who have supported that. Over the next couple of games some of those guys will get opportunities. Then there are the younger ones coming through who are also going to push that.\u201d Abraham, like Loftus-Cheek a product of Chelsea\u2019s academy, has scored four top-flight goals in 10 Premier League starts on loan at Swansea having impressed last year in the Championship at Bristol City. The 20-year-old has resisted overtures to represent Nigeria and will partner Jamie Vardy after more experienced players were overlooked for Southgate\u2019s squad despite the withdrawals. \u201cFor Defoe and Sturridge to come in and impress us in these games, that really is a big jump given the minimal amount of playing time they have had,\u201d said the manager. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean either of them are ruled out going forward. \u201cThey are both top goalscorers. But we\u2019ve got some exciting young strikers playing with the under-21s \u2013 Solanke, Calvert-Lewin and Gray \u2013 and if we think we need cover we might look to call those players up [for the Brazil match].\u201d Gary Cahill is still struggling with a back injury and will be considered only for Tuesday. So, in the absence of Harry Kane and with Joe Hart on the bench, Eric Dier will captain the side against Germany, with Southgate praising his \u201cmaturity and intelligence\u201d. The manager still considers Hart his first-choice goalkeeper but will give Pickford, Everton\u2019s \u00a330m signing from Sunderland, a first cap after Jack Butland broke a finger in training and returned to Stoke. Loftus-Cheek, who boasts 12 Premier League starts of which six have come on loan at Crystal Palace from Chelsea this season, will partner Dier in central midfield. Southgate has been in contact with Manchester United, after suggesting last week that Chris Smalling might not be up to the required standard on the ball, and intends to speak with Jack Wilshere after the international window to outline what the Arsenal midfielder, a fringe player at the Emirates, needs to do to break back into the squad. Wilshere\u2019s game-time has largely been spent as a No10 over recent times, while Southgate\u2019s 3-4-3 and its variants means the midfielder has to feature more often in a deeper role if he is to earn a recall. \u201cI have a lot of respect for him as a player, and when he was with the squad last year I really liked his mentality and personality,\u201d said Southgate. \u201cI don\u2019t think Jack is a No10. I think he is a deeper player but he is not playing deeper. But I want to be clear: I really like Jack Wilshere as a player, I think he is a talent and I really respect him as an individual.\u201d Germany, too, intend to experiment in the game at Wembley, which should attract a near-capacity crowd, as Joachim L\u00f6w prepares to defend the World Cup in Russia. The RB Leipzig defender Marcel Halstenberg will gain a first cap but Toni Kroos could be omitted because of a stomach bug. \u201cWe want to play well but I want to experiment a bit,\u201d said L\u00f6w. \u201cWe still have a few games to prepare for the World Cup. It\u2019s a bit of a test phase still, this year. With the tournament in mind, I want to see not only those players who play regularly.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
