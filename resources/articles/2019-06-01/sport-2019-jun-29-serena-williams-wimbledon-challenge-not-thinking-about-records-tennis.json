The shorter than average season on grass courts means players often arrive at the All England Club in differing states of confidence, fitness and belief. This year, that seems to be more true than ever, with Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka and Petra Kvitova all underdone as they prepare for a crack at the title. It has been a tough year for Williams, who turns 38 in September. Injuries have restricted her to five events and she comes into Wimbledon having not played a warm-up event. Over the years, the 23-times grand slam champion has made a habit of playing well at Wimbledon without much practice but, with so little tennis under her belt, she does not know how she will perform when the tournament begins on Monday. \u201cObviously, I haven\u2019t had the best time and preparation that I normally would have,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a good week and a half but I have been really just mentally training, physically training for that time here. I\u2019m just going to do the best that I can now that I\u2019m here. I know how to play tennis. I was dealing with some bad injuries all year. I just haven\u2019t had enough match play, quite frankly. I finally feel like I found some good results in Paris. I stayed there. I saw some good doctors. Yeah, I\u2019m feeling better.\u201d The knee injury that hampered her at the French Open, where she lost in the third round, has held her back physically but at times, it has seemed as if the quest for her 24th grand slam title, which would equal the record held by the Australian Margaret Court, has weighed heavily on her shoulders. But the American, whose last grand slam title came at the Australian Open in 2017, when she was pregnant with her first child, is not getting ahead of herself. \u201cI can\u2019t go into grand slams thinking about records. I just have to go into a grand slam and think about just the first match. If I get that, I think about the next match. If I\u2019m in the final, try to win one for once. That\u2019s kind of what I think about.\u201d Osaka, who was deposed this past week as the world No 1 by the French Open champion, Ashleigh Barty, went into Roland Garros with a hand injury and arrives at Wimbledon in less than confident mood having won only one match on grass in the buildup. Having won the US Open and Australian Open, the Japanese player was under the spotlight in Paris and lost early, the weight of expectation too much to cope with. \u201cMentally it was way more stress and pressure than I could have imagined,\u201d Osaka said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was anything that could have prepared me for that, especially since I\u2019m kind of an overthinker. I think it\u2019s better for me to be No 2 here because the only upside is if you win the tournament, you\u2019re automatically No 1. That, for sure, is a really big goal of mine. I don\u2019t have to think about defending the ranking or anything.\u201d Kvitova pulled out on the eve of the French Open with a muscle injury to her left arm and began practising a few days ago. The champion in 2011 and 2014 admits that had it not been Wimbledon, she probably would have taken another week. \u201cOf course, my expectations are not really high,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe this can help me, as well, to be more relaxed on the court. Sometimes when playing, the expectations come, suddenly I cannot put the ball in. Now, I\u2019m relaxed. I\u2019m not really happy that I didn\u2019t have my best preparation [but] I think from the past I learned a lot about me. Sometimes I don\u2019t really have to hit for so many hours to be prepared.\u201d If Williams, Osaka and Kvitova are all missing something, the same cannot be said for Barty, who followed up her French Open win by winning Birmingham to top the rankings for the first time. Barty looks a worthy favourite and pressure, it seems, does not bother her. \u201cThe only pressure that I put on myself is to make sure I do everything correctly and prepare as best I can to try and play a good tennis match, try and play well, to enjoy myself,\u201d a smiling Barty said. \u201cRegardless of whether I win or lose the match, I can walk off with a smile, know I\u2019ve done everything possible to try to do my best.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
