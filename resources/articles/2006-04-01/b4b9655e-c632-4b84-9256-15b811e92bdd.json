He can when his songs are sung in Portuguese and given a gentle bossa nova once-over by the Brazilian singer and actor, Seu Jorge. Some of these songs first appeared in the film The Life Aquatic, in which Jorge appeared as a Bowie-obsessed sailor. They have become a key part of his show, and, finally, a set of 13 Bowie favourites (and one by Jorge) appear on this tediously titled album. Thankfully, the music is better than the marketing. There's everything from a languid Rebel Rebel to a thoughtful Five Years. A gently charming set that could become a cult success."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
