With four others, the ex-minister of law and order admitted trying to murder an anti-apartheid activist in 1989 by poisoning his underwear with a nerve agent. On Friday he got a suspended prison sentence. For some, the Vlok case has raised fears of a belated witch-hunt and a reopening of divisions that many had hoped to see healed by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, whose monumental documentation of atrocities by both sides in the conflict was published in 1998. The commission's achievements are still debated; many feel it did not fulfil its promise. But it was never really in a position to deliver a total solution: those who confessed and made a public admission of their crimes could be granted amnesty. Those who did not, however, remained open to prosecution. The prosecution of Mr Vlok is perhaps best viewed in the spirit of reconciliation that was established by the commission. Far from being vindictive in its motivation, the case came to court only because Mr Vlok, now a born-again Christian, had sought forgiveness from his intended victim, Frank Chikane (who was secretary-general of the South African Council of Churches at the time of the attack), presented him with a Bible and symbolically washed his feet. Though Mr Vlok and the Reverend Chikane have made their peace, the case has revived calls for justice, not just truth and reconciliation. So far, only the lower level agents of apartheid have paid a price, and the idea that Mr Vlok was the only minister guilty of crimes stretches credulity. This has again raised questions about the role of FW de Klerk, South Africa's last white president, who received a Nobel prize for ending apartheid. Did he know about the campaign of assassinations, bombings and torture directed against the regime's opponents? Mr de Klerk, who was a member of the state security council under apartheid, blames rogue elements in the security forces and insists his conscience is clear - but that has not stopped some newspapers calling him a murderer and saying his Nobel prize is \"soaked in blood\". Whatever their dissatisfaction or suspicion, though, it is questionable how many South Africans really have the appetite to pursue it. In any case, time is limited: Mr de Klerk is 71 and his predecessor, PW Botha, died last year. There is now a rising generation for whom apartheid is only a childhood memory, or something they learn as history. For those who still demand justice, it is a history with gaps that may never be filled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
