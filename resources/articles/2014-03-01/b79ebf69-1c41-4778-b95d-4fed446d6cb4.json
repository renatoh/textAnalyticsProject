So it was intriguing to hear him lay down a grand challenge to Daniel Sturridge. The Liverpool striker, who is this season the most prolific of forwards available for England, should be targeting a century of games according to his manager. \"He should be looking at 50 caps and, when he has his 50, look at 100 because he's got the talent,\" enthuses Hodgson. That is a not inconsiderable gauntlet. Sir Bobby Charlton is the closest England have to a striking centurion, although it is pertinent that positionally he flowed forward from midfield. It is hardly commonplace to produce an attacker able to reach such a milestone. In the current era Wayne Rooney is closing in, with 88 caps and counting. Rooney, remember, first played for England's senior team at the age of 17. He had reached his half-century of caps by the time he was the age Sturridge is now. So it is a fascinating notion for Hodgson to invite Sturridge, who has nine caps, to set his sights on such a lofty aim. As a means to encourage the player, and to boost a sense of his importance to the national team, this looks like a useful piece of psychology ahead of the final friendly before the World Cup squad is picked. It is no bad thing for certain players to feel they have particular status in the team. Of course it depends on the personalities but, if a pivotal player is expected to deliver, it does not hurt for him to feel trusted as a main man. Sturridge might feel that way for his club but for his country he has had only two competitive starts under Hodgson. The 24-year-old is emerging as the natural choice to lead England's attack in Brazil in what will be his first major international tournament. Although Danny Welbeck has enjoyed more opportunities during Hodgson's 22 months in charge, Sturridge's whirlwind season at Anfield, during a period when Welbeck's performances for Manchester United have dipped, puts him in prime position. Hodgson certainly gives the impression he wants to make up for lost time with a player who has missed too many opportunities for his liking. \"He's hardly played for England,\" Hodgson observes. \"We've been very unlucky with Daniel. Since he's gone to Liverpool, he's done very, very well. But quite often, when we've had matches, we've been unlucky he's not been available through injury. \"In my 25 games Daniel hasn't featured anywhere near as often as I would like. Now, I'm hoping, in the next 25 he's going to feature a lot. Because he's a great talent and, if we can bottle his form and he remains fit and able, I'm confident he'll produce. It's exceptional the way he's been playing this year and now it's incumbent on him that he does that in an English shirt because there's an awful lot of England supporters out there, not just Liverpool supporters, that would be very happy to see him replicate his Liverpool form in an England shirt.\" In order to do so there is the possibility of transferring some of the connections he has built up at Liverpool into the England team, with Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling (who have only eight caps between them and are eager to seize this opportunity) joining Steven Gerrard in the squad of 30 Hodgson picked to face Denmark on Wednesday. With Rooney operating in the role Luis Su\u00e1rez takes for Liverpool, there is an option to recreate the dynamic that has helped Sturridge into such prolific form. Is Hodgson a believer in translating club links into international football? \"You certainly don't turn your nose up at it, that's for sure,\" he says. \"Whether you can actually translate it, that will depend to some extent on some of your other players. You have to accept that Germany have had a lot of joy from their Bayern Munich connection and, in particular, Spain have had enormous joy from their Bar\u00e7a connection. At the moment Juventus are having quite a big say in what Italy are doing so I think there's enough proof that this, if anything, is a positive thing. But I don't think you should be putting people in the team just because they have to play alongside somebody in their club side if they're not the best man for the job, so I've got a very open attitude towards it.\" Hodgson is keeping an open mind on just about everything at the moment, considering the fates that might befall his players between now and the end of season. It was put to him that Rooney might be affected by Manchester United's season but Hodgson expects England's top scorer not to be deflated when it comes to the World Cup. \"Is he immune? No one knows,\" shrugs Hodgson. \"To get a clear answer you'd have to go to Wayne himself and ask: 'Look Wayne if you have a bad season with Man United and things don't go well for the club, is that going to make it difficult for you, for England?' Now, what I'd hope he'd say is: 'No, when I go to England it's something different, I can compartmentalise. Whatever happened there, it's not going to affect me here.' Wayne Rooney wants to play for England. He wants to go to Brazil. He'll want to do well whatever happens at Man United.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
