Subs: Arphexad, Baros, Barmby, McAllister, Diomede, Biscan, Wright. Roma: Antonioli, Panucci, Samuel, Aldair, Tommasi, Emerson, Assuncao, Lima, Candela, Totti, Batistuta. Subs: Pelizzoli, Zago, Montella, Zebina, Cassano, Delvecchio, Guigou. Referee: R Pedersen (Norway) 1 Roma get the game underway with Gabriel Batistuta. Anfield fairly humming after the emergence of G\u00e9rard Houllier on the touchline. No Owen, so it's Emile Heskey and Jari Litmanen up front for the Reds. 2 Vladimir Smicer playing well up on the left already, but looking ready to cut in and support Heskey when needed. Danny Murphy, Steven Gerard and John Arne Riise strung across the middle. 6 Great work through the middle leaves Smicer with a shooting chance 25 yards out - well-struck, saved by Francesco Antonioli; corner comes in for Xavier and it's a penalty as Roma fluff their lines and go for the hack after a half-hearted clearance... 6 GOAL: Liverpool 1 - 0 Roma... Litmanen steps up to beat Antonioli inside his right-hand post. 9 Free-kick to Liverpool 28 yards out. Riise tees it up and Gerard whacks it; Antonioli does well to meet it but the rebound ends up as corner. Comes to nothing. 11 Liverpool looking sharp for another corner; Riise takes towards the near post, cleared to Hyypia. The Liverpool caprtain plays it across the line but Heskey's eagerness gets the better of him and he is called offside. 17 Roma starting to find their feet a bit more as Liverpool slow the pace a little. 19 Only briefly, however. A rocket of a cross by Riise is touched behind by Antonioli - but the ref didn't see the touch so no corner given. 28 Gerard picks the pocket of Emerson after a patch of much movement but little result. He centres for Smicer but Roma pressure means he cannot shoot; ethe ball comes to Riise 30 yards out but his shot clears the crossbar. 30 Roma free-kick 30 yards out; Batistuta blasts it but the wall does its job. 35 Roma free-kick out to the Liverpool right; Abel Xavier and Jerzy Dudek go up for it but Carragher clears for a corner. Dudek loses the corner and Liverpool lucky not see Batistuta, under pressure from Heskey, convert for the equaliser. 39 Heskey with a fine cross from the right into the six-yard box, cleared by Aldair. Comes out to Carragher, who crosses swiftly for Heskey to head one foot over. 44 Emerson has a crack from just over 20 yards... and that's how it stays. Shocking effort, really. 45 Gerard is clattered into the boards and ends with a bad knock on his leg and head. Good job that the ref blew for half-time soon after, then. 46 Substitutions Vincenzo Montella and Marco Delvecchio on for Lima and Batistuta. Instant corner for Liverpool; Riise takes, Tommasi heads clear. 50 Free-kick to Liverpool out on their right after Heskey is hacked down. Riise takes, cleared as far as Murphy, who tries to find Gerard on the left but Roma intercept. 51 Liverpool corner after Heskey takes on Aldair; Riise takes again, back out of Aldair for Riise to blast it into the side-netting. 54 Roma corner after Candela and Toitti work it well for Marcos Assuncao to fluff his chance in front of goal. Much more aggression about Roma this half as they up the ante and attempt to put Liverpool on the back foot. 57 Dudek almost cuaght when when he loses a cross. Heskey breaks down the right and wins a free-kick off Aldair; Riise takes for Litmanen at the far post to head back... Hyypia unable to capitalise. 59 More Roma pressure as Xavier just gets in front of Totti to deny him possession en route to goal 60 Liverpool corner after Antonioli was forced to the ground by a Riise shot. Comes to nothing, but Roma get lucky when Hyypia takes an elbow in the neck. 61 Good news from Istanbul where Barcelona have gone one up against Galatasaray, a situation that would see Liverpool through with a one-goal victory. 64 GOAL: Liverpool 2 - 0 Roma Towering header from Heskey on the the six-yard line gives Liverpool some breathing space. If they hold firm at Anfield the result in Istanbul will be irrelevant. 67 Another Liverpool corner; comes to nothing. 68 Crucial block by Hyypia in front of Totti on the Liverpool six-yard line. Substitution Antonio Cassano, Italy's most wanted youngster, on for Assuncao as Roma attempt to give themselves yet more attacking options. 78 Liverpool still full of running while the introduction of Cassano to create a four-man attack does not appear to have helped Roma. Totti looking particularly frustrated up front. 83 Liverpool free-kick over 25 yards out; Gerard takes, goes for a corner off Samuel. Riise with the corner towards Hyypia but Roma clear as Litmanen is flagged offside. 88 Substitution Igor Biscan on for Litmanen. 89 Liverpool free-kick on the edge of the Roma penalty area; Murphy takes, appeal for handball in the wall, Roma clear. Full-time So there you have it - Liverpool and Barcelona go on to the quarter-finals, while Roma and Galatasaray must count the cost of going out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
