Here's a summary of where things stand: Egypt \u2022 Violent clashes raged for at least 8 hours outside the presidential palace after Muslim Brotherhood supporters responded to a call to rally at the site, where opposition members had held a major protest and set up a minor encampment a day earlier. Security forces used tear gas but proved impotent to stop the clashes, which played out over a wide area among thousands on both sides. Weapons included rocks, gas, Molotov cocktails, guns, and clubs. An unknown number were killed. The ministry of health reported upwards of 100 injuries. Graphic images of bloody victims emerged. \u2022 President Morsi did not deliver a statement on the clashes. Prime Minister Hesham Kandil appeared outside the palace and called for calm. The Muslim Brotherhood blamed the violence on the opposition. A war of words broke out over who was responsible for the violence. \u2022 Mohamed ElBaradei emerged as the head of the opposition. In a joint press conference with other former presidential candidates, ElBaradei called on President Morsi to rescind his 22 November decree of power over the courts and to cancel a planned referendum on the constitution. \u2022 The official in charge of the planned 15 December referendum on the constitution, Zaghloul El-Bashi, resigned. \u201cI will not participate in a referendum that spilled Egyptian blood,\u201d El-Balshi said in a television interview in the late hours of Wednesday evening. Syria \u2022 Syria has dismissed claims that Assad and his inner circle are considering fleeing to Latin America. Syria's ambassador to Venezuela Ghassan Abbas said: \"It is not worth honouring these claims with a response.\" The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said the issue was discussed by Syria's deputy foreign minister during a trip to the region last week. \u2022 Hillary Clinton said the US is concerned that an \"increasingly desperate\" Assad regime could resort to chemical weapons. After a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, Clinton said: \"This would cross a red line and those responsible would be held to account.\" \u2022 Hungary has become the last European country to close its embassy in Damascus. All Hungarian diplomats have left Syria due to the \"critical situation\" according to a statement by Hungary's foreign ministry. An activist in Damascus claimed many wealthy Syrians were also fleeing the capital amid widespread fears of a battle for the city. There are reports that a Muslim Brotherhood leader was detained in Alexandria by opposition protesters and his car was destroyed. It is unknown whether he is currently detained. Six months after the Egyptian presidential election, the winning candidate is invisible and silent as violent \u2013 and reportedly fatal \u2013 clashes play out in the streets, and three of the men who ran against him appear together on television to call on him to give in to opposition demands. Pictured below at a joint press conference this evening are, from left, Hamden Sabbahi, Mohamed ElBaradei and Amr Moussa. Update: centrist leader Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a former Muslim Brotherhood member, weighs in against Morsi as well: While security forces appear to have surrounded the palace, fighting continues in adjacent streets. Sarah El-Deeb reports for the Associated Press: It is unclear how many have been killed in today's clashes. The Ministry of Health appears to have confirmed no deaths, but television stations are broadcasting reports of multiple deaths. Egypt Independent reports that four people have been killed in today's clashes, but the number does not appear to come from the Ministry of Health, and seems to count at least one rumored death that was retracted over the course of the day. The Independent reports: Clashes had spread earlier to more streets in Heliopolis as security forces tried to restore calm to the area surrounding the presidential palace, after at least four people reportedly died in clashes between protesters against the new constitution and Brotherhood supporters. ONTV presenter Yousri Fouda reported that Mohamed Essam and Karam Gergis had died in the clashes, saying this was confirmed by the Popular Current. Earlier Wednesday, Amr Zaky of the Freedom and Justice Party said that a young Muslim Brotherhood member died in the clashes, and Amer al-Wekil, general coordinator of Egypt\u2019s Alliance of Revolutionaries, told the Middle East News Agency that a woman died as well. At least one report of the death of a woman connected to the Revolutionary Socialist movement, Magdy Taha, was retracted over the course of the day. It is unclear whether the Independent report above is in reference to her. The death of the unnamed Muslim Brotherhood member is likewise unconfirmed. Rather graphic video and photography of today's violence is beginning to circulate. Brutal fights, heavy bloodshed. The ministry of health has yet to confirm any fatalities. Abdel-Rahman Hussein reports that Morsi supporters seem to be withdrawing from the palace area. And then adds: In a sign that tonight's violence could interrupt the planned 15 December referendum on the constitution, the official who was to oversee the referendum has resigned, Ahram online reports: Zaghloul El-Balshi, the general secretary of the constitution referendum supreme committee, resigned on Wednesday less than two days after he was appointed by President Mohamed Morsi following the clashes that erupted between supporters and opponents of Morsi. \u201cI will not participate in a referendum that spilled Egyptian blood,\u201d El-Balshi said in a television interview in the late hours of Wednesday evening. [...] \u201cI call on Morsi to cancel the constitutional declaration immediately,\u201d El-Balshi added. (h/t: @sedgate) Clashes continue. Al-Jazeera's Gregg Carlstrom: Guardian pen Abdel-Rahman Hussein is at the site of the clashes near the palace. The crowd chants, \"the people want to overthrow the regime.\" In the developing war of words over who is responsible for today's violence in Heliopolis, the Muslim Brotherhood disputes that the dismantling of opposition tents outside the palace today was an act of violence, with spokesman Gehad El-Hadded framing the episode as \"supporters taking down empty sit-in tents erected on public property.\" Confronted with one video of the incident, El-Haddad tweeted, \"I dont see \"militants\" in that video, or even any attacks.\" A second video posted to the news site Al-Jadeed shows young men, apparently protesters, fleeing the scene as a mob moves in to tear down the tents. Members of the group taking apart the encampment pick up stones. One can be seen firing a slingshot. The Muslim Brotherhood accuses the opposition of a \"severe escalation\" by demonstrating at the presidential palace, in a statement on today's violence reproduced here in part: Forces opposed to Morsi and Islamists are out to cause more institutional vacuum, anxiety, chaos and confusion in the political scene. In a severe escalation, demonstrations were directed to the Presidential Palace \u2013 symbol of the State and the Government \u2013 amid calls to storm and destroy the palace. New unlawful and unacceptable calls to sidestep the people's choice began to appear yet again. In fact, these calls ignore legitimacy \u2013 the presence of an elected Head of State chosen by the people in an undeniably democratic way. Furthermore, the attempt to prevent the popular referendum on the constitution can only be a stumbling block in the way of building the constitutional institutions along the path of stability that should lead to public safety and security, increase employment opportunities, raise production and attract investment. Amid these unfortunate events and collusion against the best interests of the people and the homeland, the entire Egyptian people will protect constitutional legitimacy and the choices they made by their own free will. The people will come out to the ballot-boxes for the referendum on the constitution, and later for the forthcoming parliamentary elections. [...] The Global Post's Erin Cunningham notes what the statement leaves out: There's frustration at Morsi's silence. Nadia El-Awady and The Big Pharoah are widely followed Egyptian writers and bloggers: Guardian diplomatic editor Julian Borger reports: Mystery surrounds the whereabouts of Jihad al-Makdissi, the former Syrian former foreign ministry spokesman and one of the most widely-known faces of the Assad regime. Based on a tip from usually reliable diplomatic sources, The Guardian reported yesterday that he had defected and was on the way to the US. However, the state department says he has not turned up there. A state department spokesman, Mark Toner, told al-Hayat newspaper: \"We believe Jihad Makdissi is in London, we cannot confirm. Not aware of him reaching out to US embassy,\" according to a tweet by the paper's Washington correspondent. The comment has raised British eyebrows, as UK officials were insistent throughout the day that Makdissi had not arrived in London. I understand there have been some transatlantic emails and phone calls aimed at getting the US and the UK on the same page. Meanwhile, Syria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal Makdad told Sky News that Makdissi had not defected at all and was on a \"three-month sabbatical\". It is not clear where the former spokesman is supposed to be spending the sabbatical, nor how the government claim squared with reports from Damascus yesterday that Makdissi's house had been burned down by the pro-government Shabiha militia. Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Gehad el-Haddad floats a conspiracy theory as to what group is behind today's violence. The United States gives Egypt about $2bn a year. Or is El-Haddad referring to the deal for $4.8bn in new IMF assistance that Morsi closed two weeks ago? Protest activity has been reported in Alexandria, with both Morsi supporters and the opposition in the streets. And there are reports that violence has spread farther afield. The headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party in the city of Ismailia east of Cairo has been set on fire, Reuters reports, attributing the account to a witness. UPDATE: there are no reports of violence in Alexandria, people in the street and ambulances standing by, but a prevailing mood of calm. UPDATE 2: The Muslim Brotherhood confirms the attack on the headquarters, along the Suez canal. Shadi Rahimi is a documentary filmmaker and journalist in Cairo reporting tonight on the violent clashes near the presidential palace. The Ministry of Health has not confirmed any deaths in this evening's clashes. Mohamed ElBaradei said earlier that two had died. There are onging attempts to resolve the conflicting reports. Prime Minister Hesham Kandil has arrived at the scene of clashes outside the presidential palace and is urging Morsi supporters to disperse. Amira Salah-Ahmed is an editor of the Egypt Independent: There are multiple reports of police firing tear gas in Roxy square near the palace. Sarah El-Deeb reports for the Associated Press: France 24 correspondent Sonia Dridi repeats a common sentiment: The Egypt Independent reports on the elevation of Mohamed ElBaradei to lead the National Salvation Front. The mechanism of ElBaradei's ascent is partially hidden \u2013 he appears to have been simply appointed by leaders of various factions \u2013 and there is some dissent within the opposition about the move. The Independent: Nobel Laureate Mohamed ElBaradei, in his new position as general coordinator of the National Salvation Front, threatened nationwide protests until President Mohamed Morsy responds to calls for national dialogue over the draft constitution and retracts his recent constitutional declaration. The leader of the Popular Current Hamden Sabbahi announced Tuesday night that the Front decided to appoint ElBaradei as its general coordinator. [...] ElBaradei held Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood group responsible for the violent clashes at the presidential palace in Heliopolis between pro and anti-Morsy protesters. \u201cEgyptians will protests in every place, and use all legitimate measures, and won't back down from this battle we began for freedom,\u201d ElBaradei said. He described the administration of Morsy as \u201ca repressive regime.\u201d \u201cThe demands of the revolution were for social justice, freedom and dignity. Our battle continues, and will be peaceful. Our strength is in our unity and numbers, and we will be victorious because we are in the right,\u201d he said. \u201cI call on Morsy to appear on TV to address the nation to announce that he is open to national dialogue,\u201d ElBaradei said. The area around the palace of the republic remains filled with people, although there is another apparent lull in clashes. The ONTV live stream is here. Evan Hill reports for the Times of London. 18 days refers to the gap between the large 25 January 2011 Tahrir rally and Mubarak's exit on 12 February: ElBaradei calls on Morsi to enter into talks about the constitution and stop the bloodshed. The tweet, in Arabic, reads roughly: Dr. Morsi: drop the constitutional decree and the referendum, stop the bloodshed and take up direct dialogue with the opposition. History will not forgive and the people will not forget. UPDATE: ElBaradei follows up with a tweet in English. The Muslim Brotherhood, meanwhile, continues a campaign deeply infuriating to the opposition to paint the violence as instigated by Mubarak loyalists and enemies of the Egyptian revolution. In the context of tensions over the legacy of the revolution and the current direction of Egypt's nascent democracy, these truly do feel like fighting words: At the end of his news conference this evening, Mohamed ElBaradei said that two protesters had been killed outside the presidential palace. Others warn that no deaths have been confirmed by the Health Ministry. Meanwhile, a Morsi adviser, Seif Abdel-Fatah, a professor of political science at Cairo University, has resigned on Al-Jazeera. UPDATE: there are reports that three Morsi advisers have resigned: Abdel-Fatah, Ayman el-Sayyad and Amr el-Leithy. Clashes appear to be picking up again near the presidential palace. Shaimaa Khalil reports for the BBC. Basil El-Dabh is with Daily News Egypt. Bassem Sabry is a leading voice of the opposition. On ONTV we've just seen a phalanx of Central Security Forces officers arrive at the palace, to the cheer of the pro-Morsi crowd. The CSF engaged in a brief standoff outside the palace with opposition protesters yesterday but were quickly overwhelmed. In a seemingly rapid solidification of his leadership of the opposition, Mohamed ElBaradei has told a news conference that the constitution is illegitimate and the opposition will block the national referendum on the document planned for 15 December. ElBaradei, head of the Constitution Party and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, calls on President Morsi to negotiate with the opposition. He says a dialogue must take place. Earlier today Morsi's vice president, Mahmoud Mekki, said that street protests would not dissuade the government from its plan for a referendum, and that Morsi would not repeal his decree giving himself power over the courts. Rawya Rageh reports for Al-Jazeera English in Cairo: The ONTV live video stream of the crowds around the palace and in Tahrir is here. The video views \u2013 three from the palace area and one, at bottom left, from Tahrir in the screen grab below \u2013 do not currently show active clashes. There are many people at the scene. The Muslim Brotherhood accuses the opposition of starting the violence. NPR's Andy Carvin and others have asked how that assertion squares with video earlier today showing Morsi supporters tearing down opposition tents outside the palace, and reports of violent attacks on journalists at the scene and others. Here's the video of the tents being dismantled: Many people near the presidential palace report that the opposition protesters are heavily outnumbered. Last night they staged a peaceful, much larger protest in the area and were met with little or no Muslim Brotherhood presence. Opposition activist Tarek Shalaby posted this video of clashes near the palace about a half-hour ago, just before 7pm local time. The two-minute video shows what appear to be opposition supporters throwing stones at a rival group in the distance. Loud booms are occasionally audible and a firework explodes near the end. The two groups appear to rush each other and then fall back. Violent clashes between Morsi supporters and the opposition near the presidential palace seem to be escalating as the evening wears on. Evan Hill of the Times of London is at the scene: Here's a summary of today's events: Syria \u2022 Syria has dismissed claims that Assad and his inner circle are considering fleeing to Latin America. Syria's ambassador to Venezuela Ghassan Abbas said: \"It is not worth honouring these claims with a response.\" The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said the issue was discussed by Syria's deputy foreign minister during a trip to the region last week. \u2022 Hillary Clinton said the US is concerned that an \"increasingly desperate\" Assad regime could resort to chemical weapons. After a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, Clinton said: \"This would cross a red line and those responsible would be held to account.\" \u2022 Hungary has become the last European country to close its embassy in Damascus. All Hungarian diplomats have left Syria due to the \"critical situation\" according to a statement by Hungary's foreign ministry. An activist in Damascus claimed many wealthy Syrians were also fleeing the capital amid widespread fears of a battle for the city. \u2022 Russia has urged Turkey not to exaggerate the threat from Syria after Nato approved the deployment of Patriot missiles to Turkish-Syrian border. The foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Nato foreign minsters assured him they were looking for a political not a military solution to the conflict in Syria. \u2022 The US Senate has asked the Pentagon to consider military options to stop the Assad regime killing its own people, Foreign Policy magazine's the Cable blog reports. The mandated and classified report must include detailed evaluations of the resources needed and potential effectiveness of at least three military options: deploying Patriot missiles to neighboring countries, establishing no-fly zones over Syrian population centers, and conducting limited airstrikes aimed at Assad's air power assets. Egypt \u2022 Supporters and opponents of Egyptian leader Mohammed Morsi pelted each other with rocks and fought with sticks outside the presidential palace in as a new round of protests deepened the country's political crisis. Mohamed ElBaradei, a leading opposition advocate of reform and democracy, accused the president's supporters of a \"vicious and deliberate\" attack against peaceful demonstrators. \u2022 Egypt's vice president Mahmoud Mekki has confirmed that the referendum schedule for 15 December will go ahead as planned. He also called for a dialogue between the president and the opposition to reach a \"consensus\" on the disputed articles of the constitution. Hillary Clinton also said the crisis should be resolved by dialogue. \u2022 The public prosecutor referred a complaint against three former presidential candidates to the country's state prosecution service for espionage and plotting against the state. The complaint against Mohamed ElBaradei, Hamdein Sabahy and Amr Moussa, as well as Wafd party leader Sayed Badawi, was filed by Hamed Sadek, a lawyer who is accusing the opposition figureheads of being embroiled in a \"Zionist plot\" to overthrow the Islamist-led government of Mohamed Morsi. Syria's ambassador to Venezuela has dismissed reports that president Assad and his inner circle are considering fleeing to Latin America, writes Virginia Lopez in Caracas. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz suggested Assad was planning to flee after Syria's deputy foreign minister Faisal al-Miqdad held meetings in Cuba,Venezuela and Ecuador last week. It said Miqdad brought with him classified personal letters from Assad to local leaders. Syria's ambassador to Venezuela Ghassan Abbas said: \"It is not worth honouring these claims with a response. You can ask our Venezuelan counterparts. In several interviews Assad ahs said he was born in Syria and will die in Syria. Right now he is not afraid. He is in a strong position.There is no probability that this news is true.\" Asked about Miqdad's visit Abbas said: \"This visit like other visits, served no other purpose than to further bilateral cooperation and to thank the Venezuelan government for its support. The letters were sealed but we know more or less what they contained. A spokesman for Venezuela's minister of information said: \"The only person authorized to give a statement is the ministry of foreign affairs and to date he has made no statement\". AP has more on the clashes between pro and anti-Morsi protesters in Cairo. Supporters and opponents of Egyptian leader Mohammed Morsi pelted each other with rocks and fought with sticks outside the presidential palace in as a new round of protests deepened the country's political crisis. The duelling demonstrations and violence are part of a political crisis that has left the country divided into two camps: Morsi, his Muslim Brotherhood and their ultraconservative Islamist allies, versus an opposition made up of youth groups, liberal parties and large sectors of the public. Both sides have dug in their heels, signalling a protracted standoff. The clashes began when thousands of Islamist supporters of Morsi descended on the area around the palace where some 300 of his opponents were staging a sit-in. The Islamists, members of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, chased the protesters away from their location outside the palace's main gate and tore down their tents. The protesters scattered in side streets where they chanted anti-Morsi slogans. Several opposition groups said they were calling on their supporters to head to the palace area, a move that portends more violence. Mohamed ElBaradei, a leading opposition advocate of reform and democracy, accused the president's supporters of a \"vicious and deliberate\" attack against peaceful demonstrators. \"This, in my view, is the end of any legitimacy this regime has,\" said the Nobel Peace laureate. \"A regime that is not able to protect its people and is siding with his own sect, (and) thugs is a regime that lost its legitimacy and is leading Egypt into violence and bloodshed,\" he told The Associated Press. While calling for more mass rallies is the obvious course of action, activists said opposition leaders also were discussing whether to campaign for a \"no\" vote in a Dec. 15 constitutional referendum or to call for a boycott. Brotherhood leaders have been calling on the opposition to enter a dialogue with the Islamist leader. But the opposition contends that a dialogue is pointless unless the president first rescinds his decrees and shelves the draft charter. Vice president Mahmoud Mekki called for a dialogue between the president and the opposition to reach a \"consensus\" on the disputed articles of the constitution and put their agreement in writing and have it discussed by the next parliament. But he said the referendum must go ahead and that he was making his \"initiative\" in a personal capacity. If the referendum goes ahead and the draft constitution is adopted, elections for parliament's lawmaking lower chamber will be held in February. UN forces based inside Syria to monitor a longtime ceasefire between Syria and Israel will bring in armour to reinforce their security because of a threat posed by an influx of Syrian rebels, Reuters reports. The UN force deployed after the 1973 Middle East war, in which Syria failed to recapture the Golan Heights taken by Israel seven years before and later annexed by the Jewish state in a move never recognised internationally. Speaking in Paris, peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous said a number of countries contributing to the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) had voiced concerns after two Austrian soldiers were shot on 29 November n an area of Damascus where government troops and rebels have been fighting. \"Certain countries are concerned,\" Ladsous told reporters. \"We will reinforce security, most notably with armoured vehicles and we plan to send more political advisers to analyse the situation on the ground.\" Ladsous said that while there was no plan to reduce the force, the situation in the area had \"abruptly\" changed dynamics surrounding the 36-year mission as the rebellion against President Bashar al Assad turns ever bloodier. \"The situation in Syria sparked a cascade of insecurity which has had consequences highlighted by the presence of armed groups belonging to the Syrian opposition in the disengagement zones ... There are people being trained that appear a lot like (hardline Muslim) Salafists,\" he said. There is a widespread fear of a battle for Damascus, according to a resident and activist who claimed the rebels were gaining the upper hand. Majd Arar, an engineer currently based in the Mezzeh district of western Damascus, said: \u201cThe government has lots the initiative and the Free Syrian Army is calling the shots ... the power balance is shifting because the FSA is getting more ammo and conducting more operations.: The latest clashes on the airport road and in the suburb of Darayya indicate that the battle is moving in favour of the rebels, he claimed. He said the rebels were trying to link up access to the south-east and south-west of the city. The fighting is beyond the Damascus southern highway. It almost 3.5km from the Damascus centre. So you can easily hear the sound of explosions, gunfire and shelling in the heart of Damascus. This is something that has become very usual for Damascus residents. Arar said rebels had looted arms and ammunition from airforce camps and were establishing training centres around the capital. The cost of food and fuel has risen in the capital as fears of battle for the capital spread, Arar said. Petrol prices have trebled, he said. And diplomats and wealthy Syrians from upmarket districts such as Mezzeh and Malki are now leaving and heading for Egypt or Turkey, he claimed. Everyone is fearing what is coming to Damascus. But it has to be done in terms of bringing down the regime, because until now the regime seems not willing to surrender. It is not clear yet if the FSA is willing or able to enter and storm Damascus. People here are saying the FSA should be more prepared and not revisit the same fate as [the rebels had] in Aleppo. Even if Assad chose to flee Syria, many of his inner circle, will continue to fight for their lives, Arar said. \u201cThey will not surrender because they don\u2019t have a place to go to,\u201d he said. Arar said it was unclear whether the regime was nearing the end, but added: What is happening now in Damascus is a great milestone in the whole uprising, because we are feeling the weakness of the government - it\u2019s not able to control the city. He said fewer tanks were seen in capital as the government relies more on machine guns mounted on trucks. He speculated that the regime could be trying to reserve its tanks for the last stand in Damascus. \u201cWe are optimistic about the future because it seems like we have reached a final point in what is going on in Syria,\u201d Arar said. Egypt's vice president Mahmoud Mekki has confirmed that the referendum schedule for 15 December will go ahead as planned, Abdel-Rahman Hussein reports from Cairo. As he delivered a TV address inside the presidential palace scores of Morsi supporters marched to the place in an attempt to remove opposition protesters camped out from the night before. Tents were destroyed and people attacked by the crowds. The security forces did not intervene. The violence was sporadic and temporary and a tense stand-off continues. Mekki stated that the sweeping powers Morsi granted himself were necessary because of the \"delicate period\" Egypt was in. He said they would help bring to an end the country's transition period. He also called for protests to remain peaceful, just as Morsi supporters attacked opposition protesters outside the gates of the place. Coordinator of the opposition National Salvation Front Mohamed ElBardei is due to hold a press conference at 7pm local time. He condemned the violence outside the palace. Clinton said the US is concerned that an increasingly desperate Assad regime could resort to chemical weapons. After a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, Reuters quoted Clinton saying: Our concerns are that an increasingly desperate Assad regime might turn to chemical weapons, or might lose control of them to one of the many groups that are now operating within Syria. And so as part of the absolute unity that we all have on this issue we have sent an unmistakable message that this would cross a red line and those responsible would be held to account. The US secretary of state also said Nato's decision to deploy Patriot missiles to the Turkey-Syria border sent a clear message to Assad that Turkey is backed by its allies, AP reports. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, says dialogue is the key to resolving the Egyptian crisis as she again stopped short of condemning President Mohamed Morsi's power grab. AP quotes the US secretary of state as saying: The upheaval we are seeing now once again in the streets of Cairo and other cities indicates that dialogue is urgently needed. It needs to be a two-way dialogue, not one side talking at another side, but actual respectful exchanges of views and concerns among Egyptians themselves about the constitutional process and the substance of the constitution. Analyst Michael Hanna Walid, a fellow at the Century Foundation, says America's softly-softly approach to Morsi is flawed. Writing in Foreign Policy, he says: By downplaying US concerns about Morsi's manoeuvring, the United States seems to have forgotten the most important lesson of the Arab uprisings: Usurping authority or trampling rights are not recipes for political stability. The scenes of outraged opposition in Tahrir Square and elsewhere in Egypt indicate that the Brotherhood cannot claim to represent Egypt by itself. Its efforts to do so bode ill for the country's future and have precipitated a climate where political contestation is now accompanied with overt threats and incendiary rhetoric. An unstable Egypt led by repressive rulers is a bad bet for the United States - from the perspective of values and interests ... If America acquiesces anew to authoritarian behaviour in Cairo, it won't win a new stable ally; it will only further alienate the many Egyptians who find the transactional nature of US-Egyptian ties repugnant. Even worse, it will encourage a destructive political culture that provides an unstable foundation for future relations. Hungary has become the last European country to close its embassy in Damascus. All Hungarian diplomats have left Syria due to the \"critical situation\" according to a statement by Hungary's foreign ministry. Hungary had represented Britain's interests in Syria after the UK closed its embassy in Syria. Earlier Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab British Understanding, said there were currently no European diplomats in Damascus. Russia has urged Turkey not to exaggerate the threat from Syria after Nato approved the deployment of Patriot missiles to Turkish-Syrian border. The foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, denied that Russia had tried to block the deployment of the defensive missile system. Speaking at a news conference he said: We did not protest, but merely drew attention to the fact that one should not exaggerate the threat. Yes, there were [mortar] attacks [from Syria] but we are convinced they were random ... Basically, we are saying that the accumulation of arms always creates additional risk that these weapons will be used. Lavrov said Nato foreign minsters assured him they were looking for a political not a military solution to the conflict in Syria. He said: \"It is necessary to intervene politically and diplomatically, and make all those who are fighting in Syria to stop the bloodshed and to negotiate.\" He also dismissed as \"rumours\" reports that Syria was preparing to use chemical weapons. \"Always recheck such claims,\" he said. Syria's former foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi has been debriefed by Foreign Office officials in London after defecting from the Assad regime, according to Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding. The Foreign Office refused to confirm the claim. But Doyle said he was told by a \"credible\" source this morning that Makdissi has been debriefed by UK officials. Last night the Guardian reported that Makdissi was on his way to the US. Doyle said: I know he was always interested in going to the United States so it would not necessarily be a shock if he went there as well .... The person I spoke was very straight and very assured that he was in London and that he was here under the auspicious of the government. If Makdissi is in London he is expected to make a statement later, Doyle said. Doyle also said that he has been told there are currently no European diplomats in Damascus amid signs that the \"regime is far more under the cosh than it was a couple of months ago\". He added: What will bring it down? Who knows. My gut instinct is that it will probably take some time of fighting. And even when some elements of the regime are gone, there is no guarantee that peace and security will return to Syria for quite some time. Mohamed Morsi has returned to the presidential palace, after he left it through a back gate during Tuesday's protests, AP reports citing an official. The official says Morsi was back at work at the Ithadiya palace on Wednesday. About 300 opposition supporters are camped out in front of the palace's main gate. Morsi and his aides routinely use other gates. The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, has suggested he would disapprove on any asylum deal for Assad. Speaking to AP he refused to comment directly on the matter but added: \"whoever commits (a) gross violation of human rights must be held accountable and should be brought to justice. This is a fundamental principle\". Last month David Cameron said safe passage and a possible immunity deal or Assad \u201ccould be arranged\". Speaking to al-Arabiya, the prime minister said: Anything, anything, to get that man out of the country and to have a safe transition in Syria. Of course I would favour him facing the full force of international law and justice for what he\u2019s done. I am certainly not offering him an exit plan to Britain but if he wants to leave he could leave, that could be arranged. There was no suggestion of an asylum deal being discussed in AP's write up of deputy foreign minister Faisal al-Miqdad's visit to Latin America last week. During trips to Ecuador, Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, Syria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal al-Miqdad, received mostly symbolic backing for his government's 20-month battle against rebels. But it noted Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez's support for Assad. Chavez has gone even further than his neighbours to prop up Assad, sending at least three shipments of diesel oil to the Syrian government, which is straining under economic embargoes imposed by the United States and the European Union. Chavez was also a vocal supporter of the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and has cultivated ties to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has followed a similar itinerary while mustering Latin American solidarity. Reports of Middle East dictators seeking asylum abroad should be treated with caution. In the runup to Nato's action in Libya, Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, famously claimed Gaddafi had fled Libya and was on his way to Venezuela. He cited \"credible western intelligence\". But the Syrian activist The 47th says the latest speculation should be taken seriously. Welcome to Middle East Live. Here's a roundup of the latest developments, speculation and analysis: Syria \u2022 Syria's President Bashar Assad has been looking into the possibility of claiming political asylum for himself, his family and his associates in Latin America, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. There is little confirmation for the claim but Syria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal al-Miqdad, held meetings in Cuba, Venezuela and Ecuador over the past week. Assad vowed in an interview with Russia Today last month that he would never be forced into exile and that he would \"live and die in Syria.\" \u2022 Nato has agreed to send Patriot missiles to Turkey to defend against a possible Syrian missile attack and voiced grave concern about reports that Damascus may be preparing to use chemical weapons. \"To the Turkish people we say: We are determined to defend you and your territory. To anyone who would want to attack Turkey we say: Don't even think about it,\" Nato's secretary-general, Anders-Fogh Rasmussen, said after the 28-nation alliance foreign ministers took the decision at a meeting in Brussels. \u2022 The US is ready to launch military action in Syria \u201cwithin days\u201d if President Assad resorts to mobilising chemical weapons, an official told the Times. The official stressed that the action is not imminent, but said: It won\u2019t require major movement to make action happen. The muscle is already there to be flexed. It\u2019s premature to say what could happen if a decision is made to intervene. That hasn\u2019t taken shape, we\u2019ve not reached that kind of decision. There are a lot of options, but it [military action] could be launched rapidly, within days. \u2022 The former Syrian foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi is on his way to the United States after apparently defecting, the Guardian has learned. Makdissi, the most senior Christian official yet to abandon Bashar al-Assad's regime, was reported on Monday to have variously been sacked or defected and to have arrived in London, where he used to serve in the Syrian embassy. But usually reliable diplomatic sources revealed on Tuesday that he is en route for \u2013 or already in \u2013 the US after managing to leave the Syrian capital, Damascus, for Beirut. \u2022 The US Senate has asked the Pentagon to consider military options to stop the Assad regime killing its own people, Foreign Policy magazine's the Cable blog reports. The mandated and classified report must include detailed evaluations of the resources needed and potential effectiveness of at least three military options: deploying Patriot missiles to neighboring countries, establishing no-fly zones over Syrian population centers, and conducting limited airstrikes aimed at Assad's air power assets. Egypt \u2022 Egyptian security forces have clashed with opponents of Mohamed Morsi who gathered outside the presidential palace in Cairo to protest against his assumption of new powers. Opponents say the drafting of a new constitution has been rushed and is a move towards dictatorial rule. Morsi has called for a referendum on the draft constitution on 15 December. \u2022 The public prosecutor referred a complaint against three former presidential candidates to the country's state prosecution service for espionage and plotting against the state. The complaint against Mohamed ElBaradei, Hamdein Sabahy and Amr Moussa, as well as Wafd party leader Sayed Badawi, was filed by Hamed Sadek, a lawyer who is accusing the opposition figureheads of being embroiled in a \"Zionist plot\" to overthrow the Islamist-led government of Mohamed Morsi. \u2022 Once again Egypt faces an awful choice, this time in the referendum on 15 December on the hastily drawn up constitution, according to the Economist's Pomegranate blog. A yes vote would enshrine a national charter that is packed with vague clauses, would weaken citizens\u2019 rights, provide for an over-strong presidency and greatly empower unelected religious authorities. But it would also pave the way for fresh legislative elections and set legal limits to Morsi\u2019s now-unbound executive power. A no vote would represent a blunt rebuff to Morsi\u2019s and the Islamists\u2019 ambitions. But it would also return the draft constitution to the same flawed body that passed it, and effectively prolong Morsi\u2019s 'temporary' dictatorial authority. Just now, either choice looks terrible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
