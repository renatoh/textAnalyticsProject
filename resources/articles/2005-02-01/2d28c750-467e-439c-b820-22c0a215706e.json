A blighted paradise, but a paradise all the same. I was being driven by Geoffrey Dobbs, a British businessman who pioneered luxury tourism in Sri Lanka and who's fallen in love with the place. What he showed me was was extraordinary .... mile after mile of destruction. Houses, schools, shops and small hotels either badly damaged or wiped out completely. Dobbs is fortunate - his properties survived virtually untouched by the tsunami. Even so, his response has been remarkable. He's decided to devote the next year of his life to helping the communities around him; rebuilding the fishing fleet, constructing new schools, providing new uniforms and setting up the widows of fishermen killed by the disaster in small businesses. He's received hundreds of thousands of pounds in donations from overseas, but remains adamant about one thing. If people really want to help, they should continue coming to Sri Lanka. As we drove, it became clear that tourism has borne the brunt. There were very few foreigners to be seen, the beaches were deserted. To an area that survives on the annual influx of tourists at this time of year, the tsunami has been a crippling blow. Dobbs understands why people have cancelled but insists there are still places to visit in Sri Lanka which are untouched by the tsunami. A few hotels on the coast are in operation and he says there are wonderful holidays to be had in the central highlands of the island around the tea plantations. The essential infrastructure of the place remains intact. \"People can throw a tenner in the tsunami appeal bucket, but the best way to help is to support the tourist industry,\" he said. \"If people stay away, it will be like a second tsunami for this place.\" Thailand, of course, faces similar problems. Within days of the tsunami, I was despatched to Phuket and here, a confession: television can be misleading. Looking at the pictures, you could be forgiven for thinking that the whole place was devastated. Many areas were, of course, and the consequences were appalling - I'm thinking of Khao Lak and the island of Phi Phi. But the vast majority of the resorts on Phuket were largely unaffected and are working as normal; and the rapid return of tourists to these places will unquestionably aid the recovery of the stricken areas. When I was in Sri Lanka, I met an American photographing the rubble. \"I've come over to help these people,\" he told me. \"But I've also come to get the pictures, just to say I've been here and seen it.\" Disaster tourism is nothing new and the tsunami has attracted its fair share of it. Much of it is sick. The macabre souvenir industry emerging in Phuket, for instance - the sale of tasteless T-shirts and gory pictures. But the reality is that horror attracts. As ITN's Africa correspondent in 1994, I covered the genocide in Rwanda ... a more ghastly vision of hell on earth is difficult to imagine. The images will never be erased from my mind. But now, more than 10 years on, the tourists who trek to central Africa to see the Rwandan gorillas also take time out to visit the \"memorial of skulls\". Likewise, the Killing Fields and preserved torture centres of Pol Pot's Cambodia are as prominent on the tourist itinerary as Angkor Wat. And what about Ground Zero in New York? There is justification here - a sense of \"lest we ever forget\", a feeling that the world must remember the appalling events of the past . But surely it's too early for tsunami tours as are reportedly being planned by local entrepreneurs in Thailand. After all, people are still trying to identify the corpses they're digging out. \"We don't want disaster tourists,\" said Geoffrey Dobbs in Sri Lanka. \"But there is a very strong case for tourists coming to the areas unaffected by the tsunami. They will not be insulting the dead; they will be helping the living.\" And make no mistake, many of the stricken areas will recover very quickly. The world has pledged colossal sums to help these places rebuild. I reported on the devastating floods in Mozambique and returned less than a year later to find a poor community already managing somehow to get back on its feet. And now, of course, it's become one of the fashionable tourist destinations. A final thought: Banda Aceh, in Indonesia, the other place I reported from last month, is not on the tourist map. A low-intensity civil war means the Indonesian authorities ban most foreigners. It, too, is a coastline of stunning beauty, but unlike Sri Lanka and Thailand, it will have to rebuild without the foreign currency of thousands of overseas visitors. And Banda Aceh needs it more than anywhere. Can nature ever have launched such a violent assault on man? View on the ground Sri Lanka The teardrop-shaped island at the tip of India was the hardest hit in south Asia. The string of tourist resorts along its southern coast stretching from the country's capital were either battered or just washed away by the waves. Worst hit were Hikkaduwa and Unawatuna. A month on, about a sixth of the country's 246 hotels remain closed. Almost all are on the southwestern coast of the country. But with the tourist authorities declaring that a holiday in Sri Lanka amounts to disaster aid, there is a concerted effort to bring the industry back to life. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, tourism represents 11% of Sri Lanka's GDP. There have been some immediate results. Cruise ships have started docking in Colombo again, and in a significant step Thomas Cook announced that it is resuming charter flights to Sri Lanka today. Sri Lanka has many inland attractions such as tea plantations and the beautiful hill country around the historic city of Kandy, and these are being heavily marketed as alternative holidays in the country. Maldives One-third of the Maldives' national income is generated by tourism, and the country has moved quickly to try to attract people back to its beaches and blue-water diving spots. Although more than a third of the 1,110 coral atolls that make up the Maldives were swamped, the tsunami drenched the place rather than destroying it. The ministry of tourism told reporters that occupancy rates, usually close to 100% during Christmas and New Year, were down by more than 40%. Of the Maldives' 87 resorts, 63 are operating normally. Only six were badly damaged and will need at least half-a-year to rebuild. India The tsunami bypassed most haunts frequented by tourists apart from one of the few places determined to attract more visitors: the Andaman and Nicobar islands. Before the tsunami, an estimated 100,000 people arrived every year. Now, with a huge effort to rebuild homes and roads, there seems little prospect of tourists returning in great numbers for some time. Some damage was sustained to the southern Indian town of Pondicherry, and also in Kollam, gateway to Kerala's idyllic backwaters. In Chennai, formerly known as Madras, the sandy beachfront area and promenade Marine Drive was sealed off for a few days but is open again Randeep Ramesh South Asia correspondent Thailand Within days of the tsunami, hoteliers on Phuket were eager to claim it was business as usual. The island's main beaches of Patong, Karon and Kata on the west coast were hit by the tsunami, but damage was confined to less than a kilometre inland. Of 549 hotels on the island, 200 were affected, and 3,000 rooms were lost from a total stock of 32,000. It's a different story in Khao Lak, the newer beach resort up the coast from Phuket island. Hoteliers say full recovery will take three years, and it's hard to imagine anyone choosing to loll on beaches where the most bodies were found. Similarly shattered - for the moment - is Phi Phi island. Much of the development here had been backpacker-style, on the beach, and all of that has gone. Further afield, Krabi's popular beaches are in relatively fine form, and other beaches such as Koh Tarutao, Koh Khai, Koh Adang, Koh Rawi, Koh Bulon and Koh Leepeh appear to be unaffected. Many tourists already heading toward southern Thailand have simply changed their itineraries to visit islands in the Gulf of Thailand instead of in the Andaman sea. Resorts on Koh Samui and Koh Chang are busy, as are Pattaya and Jomtien beach areas. Chiang Mai and hill-tribe villages to the west and north are busier since the tsunami tragedy. Malaysia No foreign tourists died in Malaysia as a result of the tsunami, and virtually no significant damage was recorded at any major hotel on Penang or Langkawi islands. But Malaysia's location within the region so harshly hit by the tsunami has led to cancellation of bookings. There is no reason to cancel any trip to Malaysia, but fear of insensitivity is preventing a full-scale advertisement of the fact.
