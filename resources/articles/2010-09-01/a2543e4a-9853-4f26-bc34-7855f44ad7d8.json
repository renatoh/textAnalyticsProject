In the Netherlands too it was widely maintained that open debate would diminish, not bolster, Geert Wilders's Freedom party, yet now it is one of the largest parties in the Dutch parliament and (new) government. This, it seems to me, has occurred because, firstly, the Dutch media heavily over-report anything to do with Wilders because of the sensation and excitement his statements invoke, and, secondly, it has become almost a taboo in the Netherlands to criticise Wilders's views strongly both for fear of being seen to \"demonise\" those who voted for him and for fear of making oneself politically and socially marginal. It is now entirely acceptable and mainstream in the Netherlands to \"respect\" the \"gut feelings\" (as the Dutch call them) of \"the people\" (as in \"the populace\") who vote for Wilders as a \"true indicator\" of the state of the nation, especially with respect to the equally widely accepted assertion that multiculturalism has failed. There is astonishingly little cogent opposition to these views, and to Wilders's Islamophobia, even among the so-called thinking classes in the Netherlands. I am originally Dutch, and watch with horror how a formerly civilised and forward-thinking country descends gratuitously in to a self-destructive tragedy.
