Brian Cox had joined D:Ream while he was at Manchester University. But as he did lab work by day, he also turned in crepuscular shifts in many other arenas. Eventually, a year after they disbanded in 1997, Cox was awarded his PhD in high energy particle physics. Cox, now the Hadron Collider of TV personalities, played the keyboards for Cool Britannia. His relationship with the current education secretary took a momentary hit after journalist Sarah Vine, married to Michael Gove, suggested Cox's \"intergalactic\" ego made his TV programmes hard to watch. Cox's career is an interesting cross section of political trivia and intellectual graft. CP Snow \u2013 who believed that artists and scientists, the \"two cultures\", were ignorant of each other \u2013 would have approved. Musician Cox clearly struggled with his love of science (he got a D for A-level maths, Wikipedia reports) but in the end, he didn't need help. Others do. The new English baccalaureate (EBacc) requires pupils to gain good GCSEs in a language, either history or geography, two sciences, English and Maths. There is however, a lot of opposition and teaching unions are unhappy. They are irritated at another rejig of the curriculum and angry at the loss of jobs for those teachers whose subjects have been cut. Even Nick Clegg has been heard to say privately he will not be opposing the Ebacc. Instead the debate across Whitehall is about what should be in the curriculum. CP Snow would enjoy the prospect that tomorrow's pupils will gain a deeper understanding in both the arts and sciences. While there are warm words for the humanities and languages in particular, there is a push for the sciences \u2013 maths and the sciences \u2013 to benefit more than other subjects. As all three party leaders attend the inauguration of a new Nobel style prize for engineering, they will know that current Maths provision makes it difficult for many British children to do well. The latest youth unemployment figures show there are a shortage of jobs, especially in the north-east, but experts also report there is a high demand for quantitative skills at the top end of the labour market. It is the moment for maths to shine. Professor Alison Wolf, in her report for the government on vocational education, calls maths an employee sifting device\". If an applicant has maths they get looked at. A graduate can earn \u00a3240,000 more than a non-maths graduate. Only engineering and medicine have better premiums. This is true whether you get an A or an E. New Tory MP Liz Truss, who did maths A-levels and further maths and who champions her father's profession \u2013 he is a maths professor at Leeds university \u2013 has similar figures. Independent schools exploit this maths premium better than comprehensive schools and their pupils are twice as likely to study maths and three times as likely to take further mathematics A-levels. Half of sixth forms in comprehensive schools don't offer further mathematics at A-level, meaning those children don't get the chance to try to take it further. Lib Dems are interested, but want to see evidence the subject could be the key to social mobility. It is also in favour with Steve Hilton, the prime minister's strategy chief. Hilton \u2013 along with one of Cameron's advisers, Rohan Silva \u2013 has pushed for technological and software firms to locate to the UK and for that to happen the UK's technological aptitude needs to increase. So the government is considering splitting the maths GCSE into two \u2013 maths applications, focused on practical uses, and maths methods, focused on traditional maths but perhaps including advanced elements like calculus and Bayes theory. The study of both could be compulsory, just as most schools have done with English language and English literature. There would be purism in science teaching too. Dual science is currently taught as themes. But the national curriculum review is likely to suggest that three separate sciences be restored. According to Wolf, poor numeracy has a greater effect on life chances than poor literacy, non-maths students will also soon be expected to do some kind of maths. England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are four of six countries surveyed by the Nuffield Foundation that do not require compulsory participation in mathematics at post-16 for any students. The government has said that from next year all humanities students should do a maths course between the ages of 16-18 but there was none available. Now there is a new project afoot. Non A-level students will be expected \u2013 through maths provision in apprenticeships \u2013 to learn maths up to the age of 18. Experts believe universities need to play their part by being more public about the value of maths A-levels rather than complaining in private for fear of being called \"elitist\". There will also be a move to tackle the calibre of maths teaching \u2013 the government is likely to offer further teaching bursaries for those with maths A-levels and they hope, in time, funding will follow. MPs now know, as one source put it, that in the 60s the car industry involved bashing metal but what now sets a BMW apart is its software. For this reason, officials are looking into a new computer science GCSE and A-level. It does not take a scientist to explain that with this expansion things will be displaced, and it doesn't take a professor to work out that media studies and citizenship studies will be in jeopardy. Political support for the Lib Dems comes from a muscular teaching base that is reluctant to allow this to happen. This will make it difficult for the Lib Dems to support the push towards more maths, even if it is on the grounds of social mobility. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2011.
