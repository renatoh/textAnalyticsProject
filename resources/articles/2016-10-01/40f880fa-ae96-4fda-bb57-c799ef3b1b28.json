Monday marks the 100-day anniversary of the Coalition\u2019s close-run election result and the Newspoll, published in the Australian, points to an almost even divide between support for the parties with 52% backing Labor and 48% to the Coalition. Malcolm Turnbull however has increased his lead over Bill Shorten as preferred prime minister by one point to 45%, while the opposition leader has slipped from 33% to 30%. The poll showed little improvement for the Coalition from last month, which was the worst two-party result since Tony Abbott was toppled as prime minister. Voters were also asked about the prospect of paying more for renewable energy, with 45% saying they would be willing to do so. However, 44% don\u2019t want to pay anything for energy generated through sources such as wind and solar. Nearly two-thirds of those who were open to paying more would spend about $100 a year more or less than $10 a month on renewable power. Just over half of all Coalition voters said they would not be prepared to pay more for renewable energy, with 39% of Labor voters and 25% of Greens voters also unwilling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
