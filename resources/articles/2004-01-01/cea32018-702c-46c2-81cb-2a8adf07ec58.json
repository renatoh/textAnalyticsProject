Ahead of me lay 20th-century art. In the Landscape suite at Tate Modern, I could contemplate Beuys, Smithson, Pollock. But I was detained. This painting at the entrance, placed there as a prelude, evidence of the ancien r\u00e9gime we had left behind, had me. What was it, this big, too big, panel? And why did it seem to be deliberately courting neglect, with a musty surface and a mottled, diffuse pallor? Edouard Vuillard's Lunch at Vasouy was painted in 1901, and reworked 34 years later. In fact there are two parts of the painting, separated and revised by the artist after the man who commissioned it died. It is a decoration, a mural-scale canvas painted in distemper, hence the appearance, as if it were dusty. The original dimensions are more than two metres high and nearly four metres wide. But the subject is scarcely the stuff of history painting, or joyous decoration, or anything to justify this scale. A group of middle-class people are having lunch in the open air, in the Normandy countryside near Honfleur. While couples walk and children play in a cultivated garden or park, well-dressed men and women gather around a lunch table covered with a red and white cloth. There are bottles of wine on the table, flowers in a vase. The men wear straw hats, the women long dresses. The trees above them form a fractured pattern. Vuillard's paintings monumentalise a life that might look, to us, safe and - for once the word is not loaded, just factual - bourgeois, but for him this world was a utopia he watched with desire, admiration, envy. The unfathomable quirky emotion in the Tate painting is love - love for these people, this world. The civilised milieu at Vasouy is that of his friends Jos and Lucie Hessel, rich art and theatre aficionados. Vuillard (1868-1940) led a double life, like that of a character in Proust. He lived with his mother until he was 60. When she died in 1928, the Hessels took care of him. Yet he was also a man about town, always at the theatre, the Ballets Russes, the cabaret. He was Lucie's lover, as well as her surrogate son. A retrospective of his work is about to open at the Royal Academy. And it is a moment to consider what makes art, or painting, worth bothering with. Vuillard definitely belongs to the category of artists it is easy to dismiss as not interesting. You only have to compare Lunch at Vasouy, or his even more ambitious large-scale decoration The Park, in their pastoral dignity, with Edouard Manet's D\u00e9jeuner sur l'Herbe (1863) to see the problem. Painted five years before Vuillard was born, Manet's painting is satirical, violent, embarrassing, funny, surreal, disturbing. It both inaugurates the French modern pastoral tradition, to which Vuillard's Park belongs, and mocks it. Fully-dressed bourgeois men recline in a woody landscape as if they were in a canvas by Titian, while their lovers' clothes lie abandoned with the picnic basket. Is it a sweet scene, or a corrupt one, sociable or alienated, egalitarian or exploitative? Manet leaves all possibilities open, but no one would call this a reassuring image. The reason Manet still excites us as a modern painter while Vuillard can seem - as he already did to the French by the 1930s - a bit of an old fart is that Manet is ironic about the middle class, Vuillard is not. It's time, however, to speak up for the bourgeoisie - the French 19th- and early 20th-century one. Modern art was invented by this class, shaped by this society; it existed to entertain, shock and decorate this world. Vuillard turned himself - especially in the latter part of his career after the first world war - into a reductio ad absurdum of modern French painting. His overt obsession with nice people in nice houses or gardens only makes explicit what, for some, is a turn-off about the whole of French impressionism and post-impressionism. Today, when everyone is bourgeois, no one wants to think they are bourgeois, and modern art appeals precisely because it takes us away from the dull mainstream into an imaginative space (albeit confined to a museum) where everything is in crisis. And French painting, where modernism began, really has become contemporary art's embarrassing ancestor. All those long days by the Seine, those apples, that poppy field - what was that long French afternoon? Monet's Poppies (1873) with its parasol-swinging, blue-dressed woman and white-clothed child walking through tall grass specked with red flowers on a mild half-cloudy day, with another, identical woman and child following on the brow of the hill, as if this is an idyll that repeats itself for ever; Renoir's The Umbrellas (c1881-86), with its looks of desire and solitude and its child with a hoop all under the rooftops of the umbrellas - what to do with these paintings, except dismiss them as cosy ? It's actually easy to show that French impressionist painting was full of images of the sidelines of city life, prostitutes sipping their drinks in cafes, the dingy suburbs, even manual workers; take Caillebotte's The Floor Scrapers (1875), with its glistening, naked male torsos as men strip the varnish off the floor of a smart Paris room. This is a troubling image of the bourgeois world's relationship with the non-bourgeois. Caillebotte's eye is that, apparently, of the master who may be more than \"naturally\" interested in his employees (who also exchange looks of their own). Not only that, but the setting, a grand apartment with a tall window overlooking the city, is so French upper crust. And you can go on like this (art historians do). But why should I? Why do I have to find reasons other than visual ones for liking a painting? Modernism - which is over-believed specifically and, at its purest, solely in visual values. All that mattered to a modernist looking at Caillebotte's painting was the glare of it. It was the French bourgeoisie who first started looking at art in this way. Light and colour became separated from narrative and symbolism in Paris in the 1870s, and were allowed to go their own way, find their own fun. They wandered into dances at the Moulin de la Galette and watched trains at the Gare Saint-Lazare, but none of this was for purposes of social commentary. The sunlight plays on people's faces and bodies in Renoir's painting Dance at the Moulin Galette, Montmartre (1876) like a sublime glitter ball; the broad expanse of people and chairs and trees becomes a weightless kiss of colour. Brightness is joy. The liberation of colour in French painting is one of the great ecstatic moments in the history of art, and the beginning of modernism: a modernism that was formal, visual and whose subject matter may as well have been - and often was - just some flowers in a vase, or the artist's room. By the time Vuillard painted his Octagonal Self-Portrait (c1890) the legacy of impressionism had already been chewed up and spat out as a theory of abstraction: Vuillard's Self-Portrait is a manifesto for colour, for the sheer life of it. He is a man composed of colours, his red beard a modernist dare, his yellow hair wildly setting him off. This was painted more than a decade before the Fauves got their nickname for throwing about colours like wild beasts. Vuillard belonged to a group called the Nabis - from a Hebrew word for prophet or visionary - who were influenced by the experiments in abstraction led by Paul Gauguin in Pont-Aven in the late 1880s. Vuillard's Self-Portrait is not the only Nabi painting that flirts with absolute freedom. Maurice Denis's Sunlight on the Terrace (1890) is a blast of red and orange. They were inspired by Paul S\u00e9rusier's Le Bois d'Amour (1888), a purely abstract painting made on Gauguin's instructions at Pont-Aven. And yet, by 1900, this particular avant garde felt like old men. They were figures of the 19th century, born at the wrong time. Vuillard was only 32, but the new century, in art, rapidly defined itself against the old - including the formerly new. \"The pace of progress speeded up,\" said Vuillard's friend Paul Bonnard, \"Society was ready to accept Cubism and Surrealism before we had achieved what we set out to do. We were left, as it were, hanging in the air.\" Vuillard and Bonnard both found a refuge in the domestic, bourgeois world. Vuillard began painting interiors in the 1890s; as a theatre designer he was intensely aware of modern Scandinavian theatre; paintings such as Under the Lamp (1892) make you think of Strindberg, Ibsen - and Munch. So this was not a refuge in some fatuous, consolatory sense. Bourgeois life, with its secrets and unstated emotions, offered Vuillard a passionate, poetic subject. Some of his interiors from the 1890s are terrifying - especially the ones that involve his mother. But he's very different from Munch. That fervent connection between colour and feeling in Munch would have been impossible for Vuillard. However much emotion saturates his interiors, it is never identical, as in expressionism, with emotion. It is colour. Elaborate wallpaper patterns, women's hair and clothes, carpets, flowers - for him, an interior is an intense accumulation of chromatic pleasures. And this is true even in his later paintings when, after the first world war, he reverted to a crowded realism, and to social portraits. Gauguin was the true father not just of abstract painting, but of intimism, the subtle evocation of domestic life. Gauguin, famously, did not live a snug bourgeois life. He sailed off to the south seas and became the painter of Tahiti. Gauguin's Tahiti paintings, though, are joyously domestic. They are of boys eating a meal, women talking, the artist's house, the flowers he arranges in a vase, a woman lying down. The women are Tahitian, the flowers exotic, the house a hut - but all the elements of intimism are there, including the deep life of colour. Vuillard was a Gauguin who preferred to stay at home. \u00b7 Vuillard: From Post Impressionist To Modern Master is at the Royal Academy, London W1, from January 31 until April 18.
