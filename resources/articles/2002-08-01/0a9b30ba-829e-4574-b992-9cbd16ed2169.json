The Berlin-based group Transparency International - which has been compiling the corruption index (CPI) since 1993 - studied public perception of corruption in 102 countries and found that 70 nations scored less than five points out of a possible \"clean\" score of 10. Bangladesh, Nigeria, Paraguay, Madagascar, Angola, Kenya and Indonesia - where corruption is \"rampant\" - scored less than two points each. Peter Eigen, the chairman of Transparency International, said: \"Corrupt political elites in the developing world, working hand-in-hand with greedy business people and unscrupulous investors, are putting private gain before the welfare of citizens and the economic development of their countries. From illegal logging to blood diamonds, we are seeing the plundering of the earth and its people in an unsustainable way.\" Mr Eigen said perceived corruption had increased from last year, although in some Eastern European countries the situation had improved. The former Yugoslav republic of Slovenia, in particular, ranked higher, with six points, than EU members Italy (5.2) and Greece (4.2). The UK ranked 10th, making it one of the least corrupt nations on earth, along with Finland, Denmark and New Zealand. Transparency International defined corruption as the abuse of public office for personal gain, taking in practices such as kickbacks and bribes. Mr Eigen reserved special criticism for rulers in Central and South America, where he said the graft and misrule of political elites had drained confidence in the democratic structures. \"In Argentina, first under president Menem, then president de la Rua, the state seems to have been captured by a network of leaders who misuse it in the service of their business and political interests. That is why an economic and social crisis has spiralled out of control,\" he said. Despite recent high-profile accounting scandals such as WorldCom and Enron, the US ranked as the 16th cleanest nation, perhaps because the CPI measures corruption in the public sector, rather than the private. Mr Eigen said, however, that his group was concerned about the \"abuse of the power entrusted to executives by shareholders, employees and customers.\" \"The recent revelations about money laundering and fraud, to which former Enron executive Michael Kopper has already pleaded guilty, could well be just the tip of the iceberg,\" he said. The situation may well be worse than the survey has indicated. Transparency International's index took in less than half of the world's countries - there are more than 200 - those left out due to insufficient data were \"likely to be very corrupt\", Mr Eigen said.
