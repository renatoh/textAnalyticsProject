The American swept aside the challenge of the 10th seed Anastasia Myskina without a second thought. Capriati completed a perfectly timed victory on the unflattering surroundings of court No18 as the rain began to fall at 2.20pm. She now faces Serena Williams in the quarter-finals today and can expect a considerably more substantial challenge than that posed by Myskina. Facing down Williams is like trying to pin down a hungry lioness; beating Myskina was like swatting a fly. \"I really expected a tough match and that's maybe why I played so well. I was ready for her,\" Capriati said. \"I didn't want this day to really drag on with the weather and so I really tried to close it out at the end.\" With the score at 0-2 and 40-40 in the first set, Myskina mistimed a forehand, looked over to her coach and shouted: \"I want to go home now.\" With bilingual petulance throughout - she kept what were presumably her bluest outbursts to Russian - she capitulated in the same lacklustre manner as the other Russians who faced American opponents yesterday. All Capriati - seeded eighth but better than two places ahead of her opponent on yesterday's evidence - had to do was to keep her patience and, in the main, the ball in play. With the exception of a scrappy game at the beginning of the second set she dominated, her forehand and serve proving particularly potent. Two breaks in either set were plenty as she strolled through 6-2, 6-3. Myskina did not manage even to carve out a break point. Cheered on by her usual bizarre entourage of divorced parents, brother and Friends star Matthew Perry, Capriati showed promising form. This was the first real test she had faced since losing to Chanda Rubin in the semi- finals in the pre-Wimbledon tournament in Eastbourne and she will meet Williams with confidence high. Capriati also reached the finals in the doubles in Eastbourne so has had the necessary match practice to give her hope of progressing further here. What is less of a boost to Capriati is her record against Williams. She has lost their past seven matches, although six of those went to three sets and the other to a tie-break in the second. She did, however, win their one meeting here, in the quarter-finals two years ago. \"Anyone I play, especially the No1 player in the world, I'm going to get fired up for,\" Capriati said. \"This is the quarter-finals of Wimbledon so it doesn't matter who I'm playing. You know, I'm trying to win this tournament. \"We've had some great matches in the past and I'm going to try to just concentrate on my own game and not see Serena across the net.\" This is easier said than done and facing the defending champion will be a mighty step up for Capriati. But she said: \"I'm going to be really psyched up and apply everything that I've been doing and hopefully it will be more of the same. \"Things won't change in my game and I can continue to be aggressive and serve well.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
