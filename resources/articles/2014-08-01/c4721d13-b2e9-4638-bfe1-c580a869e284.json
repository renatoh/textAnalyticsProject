Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: A prospective ceasefire in Gaza fell apart Friday morning when two Israeli soldiers were killed in fighting inside Gaza and a third was suspected captured. Subsequent Israeli strikes killed at least 62 Palestinians in east Rafah, where the capture was reported, and 19 in south Rafah later in the day, according to the Gaza health ministry. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very hard to put a ceasefire back together again,\u201d US president Barack Obama said. He condemned Hamas. Obama said that \u201cinnocent civilians in Gaza caught in the crossfire have to weigh on our conscience and we have to do more to protect them.\u201d 1,600 Palestinians have been killed and an estimated 8,750 wounded in the conflict so far, the ministry said. Israel continued striking Gaza Friday night. Rockets continued to fly into Israel, the army said, and air raid sirens were reported in Ashkelon and elsewhere. The Israeli army named the missing soldier as Second Lieutenant Hadar Goldin, 23. Sixty-three soldiers have been killed in the conflict. Hamas political officials denied knowledge of a captured soldier. One said, \u201cEven if it was true, the military leadership are the only ones authorized to report such an event.\u201d Israeli forces killed two Palestinians in clashes in the West Bank on Friday, Palestinian medical officials said. An estimated 250,000 Gazans have sought refuge in UN shelters, UNRWA said, warning of an imminent collapse of its support network. Gazan Nalan al-Sarraj recounts on Twitter getting trapped Friday with many others in no man\u2019s land at the Rafah crossing. \u201cI lived the worst terrifying experience in my life today,\u201d she writes: I was leaving to #Egypt with my mother (foreigner) and @KayanAlSarraj and @deemameshal and we got trapped in between ! #gaza We were out of connection, open area between the two gates palestinian and Egyptian Egyptian border closed because of the massive israeli attack on the area and rafah was dangerous to cross to go back to We were trapped under fire and airstrikes.We were around 120 traveler . Mostly foreigners. Crying for help the whole day The horror we lived ! We reached that point were we hold each other praying expecting the next airstrike on us. Hamas officials continue to deny knowledge of a captured soldier. A deputy said earlier Friday, \u201cEven if it was true, the military leadership are the only ones authorized to report such an event\u201d: \u201cToday\u2019s short lived ceasefire in Gaza gave many a glimmer of hope,\u201d the International Committee of the Red Cross writes in a series of tweets: Some did not know what they\u2019d find, and when hostilities resumed a few hours later, many must have been trapped anew. Even a few hours allowed for families to stock up on clean drinking water. Emergency workers were eager to go out and help. The Qassam Brigades, Hamas\u2019 military wing, has issued its first statement in the West Bank today, calling for popular retaliation, reports Gershon Baskin, founder of the Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information. Baskin tweets: Hamas says Israel has \u201cconducted crimes against Palestinians in Shujaiyeh, Khan Younis, and Rafeh\u201d. Al Qassam says West Bankers must express their rejection for the Israeli aggression, and to launch al-Quds Intifada against the occupation. \u201cIt\u2019s started,\u201d a BBC correspondent in Gaza writes: At least six bodies were discovered \u201cpiled\u201d in a room in a home in Khuza\u2019a, southern Gaza, Friday morning, witnesses told reporter Jesse Rosenfeld, who visited the scene and has described what he saw in the Daily Beast: A barefoot corpse in camouflaged khakis is being carried into the street, partially wrapped in rug, as I enter the house. His partly burned and partly decomposing face is unrecognizable as anyone who was ever alive and breathing. Witnesses say there were at least six bodies piled together inside this one tiled room where the air is poisonous with decay. [...] The house is filled with casings from the bullets used in assault rifles. They are marked on the bottom as \u201cIMI\u201d (Israel Military Industries). Rosenfeld says it\u2019s unclear what happened in the house. \u201cNear the ruins of a demolished store, the black ammunition vests worn by Palestinian fighters lie in tatters as if hastily stripped off,\u201d he writes. Reporters gained access to Khuza\u2019a, which was pulverized in 10 days of strikes, during the brief ceasefire window Friday morning. Read the full piece here. (h/t @rayajalabi) Via Guardian Washington correspondent Paul Lewis: A last question for Obama on Gaza, which is very close to the first question, and sympathetic to the Israeli description of the drivers of the current conflict: How is a ceasefire possible with tunnels still in operation? \u201cThe ceasefire would have given Israel the capability to continue to dismantle these tunnel networks,\u201d Obama says, but it was broken. Obama says the Israelis have a right to dismantle the tunnels, but there\u2019s a way of dismantling the tunnels \u201cwhile still reducing the bloodshed.\u201d Anybody who\u2019s been watching some of these images I\u2019d like to think should recognize the costs. You have children getting killed... You have Israelis whose lives are disrupted constantly, and living in fear. And those are costs that are avoidable if we were able to get a ceasefire that preserves Israel\u2019s ability to defend itself... and, conversely, an agreement that recognizes the Palestinian need to make a living... to live a decent life. But it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s going to be hard to get. There\u2019s a lot of anger, and a lot of despair.. but we have to keep trying. As our live blog coverage continues, here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: President Obama condemned Hamas for killing two Israeli soldiers inside Gaza and \u201cabducting a third minutes after a ceasefire was announced.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very hard to put a ceasefire back together again,\u201d Obama said. The US president said the captured soldier \u201cneeds to be unconditionally released.\u201d Obama: \u201cinnocent civilians in Gaza caught in the crossfire have to weigh on our conscience and we have to do more to protect them.\u201d A planned ceasefire crumbled Friday as clashes in southern Gaza left two Israeli soldiers dead and one missing and suspected captured by Hamas. Subsequent strikes by Israel killed at least 62 in Rafah, the Gaza health ministry said. The Israeli army said second lieutenant Hadar Goldin, 23, was suspected to have been captured. The total number of Israeli soldiers killed in the conflict stands at 63. Hamas officials have said the group\u2019s political leadership has no information about a captured Israeli soldier. 1,600 Palestianians have been killed, the health ministry said. 250,000 Gazans have been displaced, the UN said. Israeli forces killed two Palestinians in clashes in the West Bank on Friday, Palestinian medical officials said. Air raid sirens were reported in Ashkelon and elsewhere in Israel as rockets and mortar fire from Gaza resumed. Obama continues on the theme of American power: \u201cIt\u2019s a big world out there, and as indispensable as we are to try to lead it, there\u2019s still going to be tragedies out there, there\u2019s still conflicts, our job is to just make sure that we continue to project\u201d leadership, he says. Obama is asked whether he could\u2019ve done more. Which conflict? he asks. Then he talks about Kerry\u2019s failed effort to broker a broader Israeli-Palestinian peace deal: This administration invested an enormous amount to try to bring the two sides together... In the end, it\u2019s up to the two parties to make a decision. We can lead them to resolve some of the technical issues and to show them a path, but they\u2019ve got to want it. Obama is asked whether the United States is helpless to resolve the Gaza conflict and other global conflicts. \u201cAmerica as the most powerful country on earth still does not control everything througout the world,\u201d Obama says. \u201c...That\u2019s the nature of world affairs... it\u2019s not smooth.\u201d Obama decries the \u201cincredibly irresponsible actions on the part of Hamas to oftentimes house these rocket launches right in the middle of civilian neighborhoods.\u201d Obama says Israel has a right to defend itself and that the threats from rockets and tunnels is intolerable. At the same time we must be clear that innocent civilians in Gaza caught in the crossfire have to weigh on our conscience and we have to do more to protect them... a ceasefire was one way. Israel commited to that 72-hour ceasefire, and it was violated. And putting that back together will be difficult. Obama credits Kerry with working hard and enduring \u201creally unfair criticism simply to try to get to the point where the killing stops.\u201d I think it\u2019s going to be very hard to put a ceasefire back together again if the Israelis and the international community can\u2019t feel confident that Hamas can follow through.\u201d First question for Obama: why should Israel embrace a ceasefire with reports of a captured soldier? First of all I think it\u2019s important to note that we have and Ihave unequivocally condemned Hamas and the Palestinian factions that were responsible for killing two Israeli soldiers and abducting a third minutes after a ceasefire was announced. I want to make sure they are listening... That soldier needs to be unconditionally released as soon as possible. Obama begins speaking. Watch here. He announces he will take questions after saying \u201ca few words about the economy.\u201d Turkey will do what it can to help free an Israeli soldier suspected captured Friday, but the priority should be the reinstatement of a truce, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has said. Reuters reports: \u201cWhat is important is that the ceasefire is reinstated. To ensure this, together with others, we can take any step that could resolve this Israeli soldier issue. If Turkey can do anything, we will do our best,\u201d Davutoglu told reporters. \u201cBut if the ceasefire is stopped because an Israeli soldier is kidnapped, somebody should account for the 70 Palestinians killed (today). In our eyes, all people are equal. ... \u201cThis ceasefire was something that we built together and we agreed as a matter of principle that we will not let it crumble,\u201d Davutoglu said of his discussion with Kerry, adding that renewed talks would now be held involving Turkey, the United States and Qatar. \u201cWe\u2019ll do what is necessary to get the ceasefire we worked so hard for back on track. We\u2019ll put together a framework that is based not on allegations from one side but one that is satisfactory for both sides,\u201d he said. The IDF reports that 61 rockets were fired at Israel Friday and nine were intercepted, and that in the course of the conflict 3,025 rockets have been fired at Israel and 549 intercepted. President Obama is scheduled to make a statement at the White House at 2.35pm ET. He spoke earlier Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Obama is likely to address fighting in Ukraine as well as Gaza, although the occasion for the address is unspecified. The daily state department briefing was canceled. It\u2019s just past 9pm local time in the region. The latest figures from the Gaza health ministry put the number of Palestinian dead in the current conflict at 1,600, with an estimated 8,750 wounded. Hamas official Ismail Radwan has said the group\u2019s political leadership has no information about a captured Israeli soldier, Jack Khoury of Haaretz reports. Radwan went on to say: Even if it was true, the military leadership are the only ones authorized to report such an event. At 7:00 A.M. Al-Qassam Brigades were fighting Israeli forces entering Rafah. These forces planned to remain in place, violating the cease-fire, so we acted against the forces and harmed soldiers. Update: Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum is reported also to have said that Hamas political leaders don\u2019t have any information about a captured soldier. Israeli forces killed two Palestinians in clashes in the occupied West Bank on Friday, Palestinian medical officials said, Reuters reports: The violence erupted when a few thousand Palestinians took to the street to protest at Israel\u2019s military operation in the Gaza Strip. Both men were killed by live fire in two separate incidents, Palestinian medical officials said. An Israeli military spokeswoman said troops shot one man in the city of Tulkarm after violence got out of control, with protesters throwing stones and petrol bombs at soldiers. The spokeswoman said she was looking into the second incident. The death toll from the pounding of east Rafah Friday has risen to 62, with at least 350 wounded, the Gaza health ministry reports. The number of Gazans in UN shelters has reached 250,000, meanwhile, UNRWA reports: In its story on the suspected capture of an Israeli soldier Friday, the New York Times reports that it received its first censorship notification in two years, from Israeli military censors informing the newspaper that \u201cfurther information related to the soldier would have to be submitted for prior review\u201d: The Israeli military identified the missing soldier as Second Lt. Hadar Goldin, a 23-year-old officer in an infantry brigade. After the initial publication of this article, the military\u2019s censor informed The New York Times that further information related to the soldier would have to be submitted for prior review. Journalists for foreign news organizations must agree in writing to the military censorship system to work in Israel. This was the first censorship notification The Times had received in more than two years. UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon has condemned the breaking of the ceasefire and called on \u201cboth sides\u201d to return to it. \u201cHe is shocked and profoundly disappointed by these developments,\u201d Ban spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric said. \u201cThe secretary-general is deeply concerned about the resumption of Israeli attacks on Gaza.\u201d \u201cThe secretary-general urges both sides to show maximum restraint and return to the agreed 72-hour humanitarian ceasefire that tragically lasted such a brief period of time,\u201d Dujarric said. As our live blog coverage continues, here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: A planned ceasefire crumbled Friday morning in a clash in southern Gaza in which two Israeli soldiers were killed and a third \u201csuspected\u201d captured, the Israeli military said. US secretary of state condemned the \u201coutrageous\u201d violation of the ceasefire and called on Hamas to \u201cimmediately and unconditionally release the missing Israeli soldier\u201d. He appealed to Turkey and Qatar to intercede with Hamas. 40 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes on Rafah Friday morning and more than 250 were wounded, the health ministry said. Air raid sirens were reported in Ashkelon and elsewhere in Israel as rockets and mortar fire from Gaza resumed. The Israeli military said 2nd lieutenant Hadar Goldin, 23, was suspected captured. Hamas at first confirmed and then denied knowledge of a capture, Haaretz reported. Five Israeli soldiers were killed Thursday, the Israeli military announced Friday, bringing the total killed in the conflict to 63. The Gaza health ministry recorded the number of Palestinians killed as of Friday morning local time at 1,422. Journalists gained access Friday morning to Khuza\u2019a in south Gaza, after the area saw 10 days of shelling and bombing. They found a field of total destruction. Gazans returned to shelters in Gaza City and elsewhere after using the brief ceasefire Friday to visit their homes or former homes. There was \u201csignificant concern that Gaza is facing a very tough night,\u201d Jason Burke reported. US secretary of state John Kerry called on Turkey and Qatar on Friday to use their influence to secure the release of 2nd lieutenant Hadar Goldin, suspected captured by Hamas Friday morning, Reuters reports: Kerry called Qatari Foreign Minister Khalid bin Mohammed al Attiyah and Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu soon after an aide informed him of reports of the abduction, and the killings of two Israeli soldiers, while flying back from a visit to India. The incidents led to the quick breakdown of a ceasefire Kerry had worked hard to broker. \u201cWe have urged them, implored them to use their influence to do whatever they can to get that soldier returned,\u201d a senior State Department official told reporters traveling with Kerry. \u201cAbsent that, the risk of this continuing to escalate, leading to further loss of life is very high.\u201d The US Senate unanimously passed legislation on Friday to provide $225m for Israel\u2019s \u201cIron Dome\u201d missile defense system, Reuters reports: An earlier version of the funding plan had failed on Thursday when Senate Republicans blocked a broader spending bill that was largely intended to provide money to handle the current immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. But lawmakers reached an agreement overnight to pass the missile funding measure. To become law, the funding plan must still pass the House of Representatives and be signed by President Barack Obama. Given U.S. lawmakers traditionally strong support for Israel, it is not expected to encounter significant resistance in the House. Haaretz carries further reports of a Hamas denial that a soldier was captured. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, has called on Hamas to \u201cimmediately and unconditionally release the missing Israeli soldier\u201d and has condemned the \u201coutrageous\u201d violation of the ceasefire. NBC News has Kerry\u2019s statement: Early on Friday, the Israeli military reported that five soldiers had been killed on Thursday by mortar fire \u201cduring operational activity along the Gaza border\u201d. The IDF has named the two additional soldiers killed in the fighting in east Rafah on Friday morning. They are Major Benaya Sarel, 26, and Staff Sergeant Liel Gidoni, 20. The total number of Israeli soldiers killed in the current conflict stands at 63, not counting one soldier now missing, Second Lieutenant Hadar Goldin. On Friday morning journalists gained significant access \u2013 cut short by reported Israeli tank fire \u2013 to the former village of Khuza\u2019a in south Gaza, which was demolished over the last 10 days by Israeli bombing: Here is a passage from a first-person account of the decimation of Khuza\u2019a, by a writer identified as student Mahmoud Ismail. It was posted to Facebook and published on Global Voices Online on Monday, 28 July: The first attack was on the road to Khan Younis, cutting Khuza\u2019a off. The second hit the power transformers. The third, the mobile phone towers. The fourth, the landlines. We were alone, and the night in Khuza\u2019a was pitch black, and the bombardment wasn\u2019t stopping. The planes were hitting everything. The glass was falling from the windows, shrapnel was flying into the house and all around us. We sheltered in a place we thought was less dangerous, taking a position we thought would protect us. We counted the attacks and calculated the possibilities: is this the sound of a missile on its way to us? Is this shell in the house? Why hasn\u2019t it exploded? Is so-and-so\u2019s house targeted? Such-and-such mosque? This is a F16 attack, that is an artillery bombardment. The whole night was spent trying to hold on to our minds and what remained of our nerves. Unexploded ordnance in Gaza: The father of missing soldier Hadar Goldin has made a statement, Reuters reports: The Guardian\u2019s Jason Burke (@burke_jason) is in Gaza City, where he reports an atmosphere that \u201cis very tense, clearly\u201d: A lot of people went out this morning during the ceasefire to either go home or check on their homes \u2013 including one family of 50 I spoke to an hour ago who shifted en masse back to their village. They are all back now in the temporary shelters, such as the schools, or with their relatives in safer zones. Everyone is hearing the reports of heavy firing and fighting in Rafah, in the south, and there is significant concern that Gaza is facing a very tough night and a very tough time in coming days. Streets that were bustling at 8.30 this morning are now empty. I was in one UN-run IDP shelter earlier where one woman said she just wanted \u201call this to be over\u201d. Her son, 15, said he could not imagine peace and would see many more wars in the years to come. The status of missing soldier Hadar Goldin is unclear. The Israeli military refers to him as \u201csuspected kidnapped\u201d. Hamas earlier said a soldier had been captured but now multiple sources including Haaretz and an analyst with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, below, say Hamas is \u201cbacktracking\u201d on that claim. Guardian Middle East editor Ian Black (@Ian_Black) writes: Ten days into the latest Gaza war, Hamas claimed to have captured an Israeli soldier in heavy fighting in Shujai\u2019iya. But the army said later that he was presumed dead. The possibility remains that Palestinian fighters may be holding his remains for another bout of bargaining between unequal but bitter enemies. A Facebook page, Hadar Goldin Come Home, has been set up. Channel 4 News is reporting that the soldier is from a family of British Jewish immigrants and that it is understood he is a cousin \u2013 either second or third \u2013 of Israel\u2019s defence minister, Moshe Ya\u2019alon. Update: This report has been contradicted. My colleague, Matthew Taylor, has a story on the rise of antisemitic attacks this year. He writes: Antisemitic hate crime rose by more than a third in the first six months of the year and spiked to a five-year high in July, figures show. The Community Security Trust, which records attacks on the Jewish community in the UK, found there had been a 36% rise in antisemitic incidents, including violent crime and vandalism, to 304 between January and June. This was followed by 130 incidents in July alone, which coincided with the Israeli military offensive in Gaza. CST spokesman Mark Gardner said: \u201cThere is no excuse for this wave of racist intimidation and violence and we call upon all good people to unequivocally condemn it.\u201d You can read the piece in full here. The Guardian\u2019s Middle East editor, Ian Black, explains the significance of the capture of the Israeli officer, which looks certain to doom any prospect for an early end to the fighting. It looked like a significant gain for Hamas when Palestinian fighters captured an Israeli officer near Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on Friday in an operation that was apparently designed to take advantage of a ceasefire and improve the terms of any eventual cessation of hostilities. Uncertainty about the details of the incident nothwithstanding, the capture of the officer \u2013 named by the army as Second Lieutenant Hadar Goldin \u2013 looks certain to end any prospect of an immediate ceasefire and reinforce the Israeli government\u2019s determination to carry on fighting. Any capture of Israeli personnel inevitably recalls the case of Gilad Shalit, a young conscript captured by Palestinian fighters on the border with Gaza in 2006 and held for five years before being traded for the release of 1,027 Palestinians. Gershon Baskin, an Israeli peace activist who helped negotiate Shalit\u2019s release, said he believed that the Izzedine Al-Qassam brigades, the military wing of Hamas, had made a grievous error. \u201cAl-Qassam just signed the death sentence of many Hamas leaders,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThere will not be another Shalit deal.\u201d Capturing Israelis, dead or alive, is seen by Hamas and other Palestinian groups as a strategic weapon that can help redress the huge military imbalance between the two sides. Corpses and body parts have been traded in previous exchanges. Ominously, one senior Israeli figure compared the Rafah capture to the \u201cstrategic\u201d cross-border operation mounted by Hezbollah in 2006, in which three Israelis soldiers were killed and two captured in an elaborate ambush \u2013 and which triggered that year\u2019s war. Two years later the bodies of the two soldiers were returned to Israel by Hezbollah in exchange for a Palestinian and four Hezbollah prisoners. \u201cThis prevents any possibility of dialogue,\u201d Giora Eiland, a former general and national security adviser, told Israel Radio. \u201cNo Israeli government would agree to that after a breach like this of an an agreed ceasefire.\u201d Israel would now be unlikely to agree to any truce without at least obtaining information via the Red Cross about the prisoner, he said. The Hamas move suggests that the Al-Qassam brigades had not been prepared for negotiations without a significant victory \u2013 and a strong negotiating hand \u2013 to show for the sacrifices of the last three weeks, in which more than 1,400 Palestinians have now been killed. Shalit\u2019s is the most recent case, but the abduction of Israeli soldiers is an emotional issue in a society where almost every Jewish family has a connection to the military. Israeli Jews are required to do military service from the age of 18. Hundreds of thousands remain liable for reserve duty for years afterwards. Combat units are required to do everything possible to avoid capture. The so-called \u201cHannibal directive\u201d was drawn up in 1986 following the capture of two soldiers in Lebanon. It stated: \u201cAt the time of a kidnapping the main mission becomes forcing the release of the abducted soldiers from their kidnappers, even if that means injury to our soldiers.\u201d Ten days into the latest Gaza war, Hamas claimed to have captured an Israeli soldier in heaving fighting in Shujai\u2019iya. But the army said later that he was presumed dead. The possibility remains that Palestinian fighters may be holding his remains for another bout of bargaining between unequal but bitter enemies. US officials have strongly condemned the capture of an Israeli soldier. \u201cThat apparently Hamas individuals used the cover of a humanitarian ceasefire to attack Israeli soldiers and even to take one hostage. That would be a rather barbaric violation of the ceasefire agreement,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest told CNN. Calling on Hamas to release the Israeli soldier, he said John Kerry, the secretary of state, had already spoken to the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, about the next steps in the crisis. The US urged the international community to condemn the Hamas ceasefire violation in the \u201cstrongest possible terms\u201d, Earnest said. \u201cAnd we would encourage those who have influence with Hamas to get them back on to the terms of the ceasefire and to get them to abide by the agreements that they struck just yesterday.\u201d The 72-hour humanitarian ceasefire has collapsed as Israeli forces launched a search for a soldier they fear may have been captured by militants. He has been named as 2nd Lieutenant Hadar Goldin, Israel Radio reports. An Israeli official said the soldier went missing during a fight with fighters who emerged from a concealed tunnel, one of whom blew himself up with an explosives belt. Hamas said the incident occurred before the ceasefire. Heavy Israeli shelling in Rafah in southern Gaza has killed at least 40 Palestinians. A Hamas official said Israel\u2019s announcement of the capture was simply a justification for Israel breaking the truce. The dramatic collapse of the ceasefire calls into question scheduled talks in Cairo. Israeli and Palestinian delegations had been expected for discussions moderated by the Egyptian government. The abducted soldier has been named as 2nd Lieutenant Hadar Goldin, 23, from Kfar Saba, Israel Radio reports. AFP has a roundup of today\u2019s developments. Israeli forces in the southern Gaza Strip are searching for a missing soldier they fear may have been captured by militants at the start of a new ceasefire Friday, the army said. The UN said two soldiers had been reported killed, apparently during the same firefight that led to the abduction. \u201cInitial indications suggest that a soldier has been abducted by terrorists in an incident where terrorists breached the ceasefire,\u201d Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner told journalists. Asked if that meant the truce was over, he replied: \u201cYes. We are continuing our activities on the ground.\u201d Hamas, the main political and military power in Gaza, neither confirmed nor denied the capture. But it said Israel\u2019s announcement of the capture was simply a \u201cjustification for Israel retreating from the truce, and a cover-up for massacres especially in Rafah,\u201d referring to Israeli shelling that killed at least 35 people just hours after the truce took hold. Lerner said the soldier went missing during a fight with militants who emerged from a concealed tunnel, one of whom blew himself up with an explosives belt. He said the clash took place in Rafah, on the border with Egypt, where an AFP correspondent earlier reported fierce fighting as the army warned residents by telephone to stay in their houses as it \u201cpursued terrorist elements.\u201d A separate military statement said the incident took place at around 0630 GMT, 90 minutes after a 72-hour ceasefire was to have gone into effect. But Hamas said it was Israel which violated the truce. \u201cIt is the occupation which violated the ceasefire. The Palestinian resistance acted based on \u2026 the right to self defence (and) to stop the massacres of our people,\u201d spokesman Fawzi Barhum said in a statement. The UN said it was informed by Israel of \u201ca serious incident this morning after the start of the humanitarian ceasefire at 8am (0500 GMT), involving a tunnel behind IDF (army) lines in the Rafah area.\u201d \u201cTwo soldiers were reportedly killed, as well as a number of Palestinians,\u201d said a statement from the UN special coordinator for Middle East peace, Robert Serry. \u201cIf corroborated, this would constitute a serious violation of the humanitarian ceasefire \u2026 by Gazan militant factions, which should be condemned in the strongest terms,\u201d the statement said. Turkey\u2019s Anadolu Agency has this report on the capture of the Israeli soldier, in which Hamas blames Israel for the breakdown of the ceasefire. An Israeli officer was captured and two soldiers were killed ahead of the start of a 72-hour humanitarian ceasefire in the Gaza strip on Friday, senior Hamas leader Moussa Abu Marzouk has said. \u201cThere is no justification for Israel to violate the truce as the officer was captured and the two soldiers were killed ahead of the truce,\u201d Abu Marzouk told Anadolu Agency. He said that Palestinian factions were abiding by the truce and were only responding to Israeli \u201caggression\u201d. \u201cIsrael ended the truce unilaterally,\u201d Abu Marzouq said. \u201cWe are committed to the truce and only respond to aggression.\u201d The Jerusalem Post has this account of the Israeli soldier\u2019s kidnapping, which has added another layer of complexity to the conflict. A Hamas attack on IDF soldiers in southern Gaza, which occurred an hour-and-a-half after the start of a humanitarian [ceasefire], ended with the suspected kidnapping of a soldier, the IDF said Friday. Terrorists emerged from a tunnel shaft, and a suicide bomber detonated himself in the vicinity of soldiers. Heavy exchanges of fire ensued, before one of the IDF soldiers was kidnapped, a senior army source said. \u201cThe incident is ongoing, and the IDF is in the midst of operational and intelligence efforts to track down the soldier,\u201d the army added. The statement came after Palestinians reported heavy exchanges of fire in southern Gaza, in which several Hamas attackers were reportedly killed in IDF return fire. Around 10am rocket and artillery fire resumed, bringing an end to the 72-hour humanitarian ceasefire brokered by the UN and the US that went into effect just two hours prior. In this leader, the Guardian argues that the Netanyahu government is paying the price of failing to engage in serious negotiations for years: The more fundamental reason why Israel went in is not related to what Hamas or Israel has done, but to what Israel has left undone. The distinguished Israeli writer David Grossman, addressing himself to Israeli leaders, asks: \u201cHow could you have wasted the years since the last conflict without initiating dialogue, without even making the slightest gesture toward dialogue with Hamas, without attempting to change our explosive reality? Why, for these past few years, has Israel avoided judicious negotiations with the moderate and more conversable sectors of the Palestinian people \u2026 Why have you ignored, for 12 years, the Arab League initiative that could have enlisted moderate Arab states with the power to impose, perhaps, a compromise on Hamas?\u201d If you want peace, prepare for war, says the Roman proverb. But here it is the opposite: if you want to avoid war, prepare for peace. The Netanyahu government is paying the price for having sedulously avoided real negotiations with the Palestinians through a long series of subterfuges and distractions culminating in the recent barren passage that, over many months, wore down even the ever- patient and optimistic John Kerry. Any capture of Israeli soldiers will bring to mind the drama over Gilad Shalit, who was captured by Hamas in 2006 and held for five years before being traded for the release of 1,027 Palestinians. Haaretz\u2019s Anshel Pfeffer links the shelling in southern Gaza to the apparent capture of an Israeli soldier. My colleague, Jason Burke, was in the town of Beit Hanoun when the ceasefire began to crumble after just a few hours. It was quite a heavy night with a fair amount of naval shelling coming in and what sounded like some significant airstrikes but all was quiet after 8am. In Gaza City, fishermen immediately put to sea, cautiously keeping close to the shore, after nearly four weeks without working. There was a general sense of real relief. Most people I spoke to seemed to think the ceasefire would hold. Up in Beit Hanoun, a town near the northern border of Gaza which has seen sustained bombardment and fighting, hundreds of families were making their way back to find their homes, or what remained of them. A couple of bulldozers were trying to clear some of the streets. Power lines coiled across the streets, amid the putrefying corpses of dead donkeys. One woman sat sobbing in the rubble. Many people were very angry. \u201cThis is like the second world war, like a nuclear explosion,\u201d said Ahmed Kufurna, 40. All hoped the ceasefire would hold. \u201cThis is the worst and the hardest war I have seen,\u201d said Seehan Nassr, 42. \u201cGod willing now it will be peaceful.\u201d But about 11am, we could hear small arms fire and see what appeared to be strikes from artillery or tank fire around the town\u2019s edges a few hundred metres from where we were. In Shujai\u2019iya, to the east of Gaza City, the situation and sentiments were similar \u2013 a lot of families heading back to salvage belongings or see what had happened to their homes, and then a rush back for safety when shelling started. As reports of fighting and shelling and casualties in Rafah, down on the Egyptian border, started filtering in, the streets in Gaza City began to empty. Now we can hear what sounds like artillery fire, possibly from offshore. It\u2019s not as heavy as it was overnight but is fairly steady. The fishermen are gone, except one small boat making its way back in. An Israeli soldier was apparently captured by Palestinian militants during a clash in southern Gaza, an Israeli military spokesman said, according to Reuters. \u201c(Israeli) forces operating to decommission an (infiltration) tunnel were attacked. Initial indications are that a soldier has been abducted by terrorists during the operation,\u201d the spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, said in a conference call with journalists. Rafah in southern Gaza came under heavy shelling this morning. AP and AFP put the number of deaths from Israeli shelling in Rafah in southern Gaza at 27. Reuters earlier reported 40 deaths. Yigal Palmor, an Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, tells the BBC that the truce was \u201cbrazenly broken\u201d by Hamas and that Israeli forces were \u201cresponding all along the frontline\u201d. \u201cI can confirm that Israel responded to Hamas fire, rockets and attacks against our troops,\u201d he said. My colleague, Harriet Sherwood, speaks to an Israeli soldier. At Erez, the main border crossing between Israel and Gaza, a soldier told me the ceasefire \u201cwas broken\u201d. Rocket fire from Gaza had resumed, and Israel had responded, he said. At a cafe a mile away, Israeli troops on a break from the fighting milled about in dusty kit, some meeting up with loved ones. One hugged his three young children and pregnant wife, declining to speculate whether the war would continue. A group of three young soldiers in sweat-drenched uniforms and with assault rifles slung over their shoulders had just returned from the other side of the border. The truce was over, said one. Asked what it was like in Gaza, he shrugged. Soldiers are banned from speaking to the media. Haaretz, which is one of the more critical voices of Israeli policy, argues that the Israeli army is relying too much on firepower in the absence of good intelligence. MI (military intelligence) failed to uncover the Hamas command centre and locate the hiding place of its commanders. Senior IDF officers boasted during the first days of Operation Protective Edge of huge achievements, of striking a mortal blow at Hamas, of signs the enemy was breaking. But Mohammed Deif and his men continue to control their forces, launch rockets at Israel and attack IDF troops even in the fourth week of the fighting. Absent high-quality intelligence and battle plans, the IDF chose the Operation Cast Lead solution \u2013 massive fire at populated zones, with major harm to civilians. The number of Palestinian dead has reached 1,400, most of them civilians. Hundreds of thousands have become refugees; many homes have been destroyed. Despite the cloak of legal approval with which the army covers itself, it is hard to be persuaded that a real effort has been made to limit harm to the innocent, to maintain the morality of the fighting, and to avoid deepening the hatred of our neighbours, next to whom we will have to live when the weapons fall silent. The Israeli Defence Forces tweets on rocket and mortar fire. The persistently high civilian death toll in Gaza has raised questions among military analysts and humanitarian law experts over the quality of training of Israeli gunners and their rules of engagement in such heavily populated areas, writes Julian Borger, the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor. He quotes Amnesty International\u2019s Donatella Rovera. \u201cReckless targeting is a recurring problem, and the hand-wringing and words of regret no longer have any value. If you are making the same mistakes again and again, you would hope something is being learned,\u201d she said, adding there was no sign of any disciplinary action for IDF mistakes that kill civilians. \u201cThere is no pattern of anyone being held to account, and impunity just leads to more reckless behaviour.\u201d The death toll from Israeli shelling near the southern Gaza town of Rafah is rising sharply. Reuters is now reporting that at least 40 people have died, which would make this one of the deadliest days of the conflict. Ayman Mohyeldin of NBC News captures the change of mood. The fragility of the ceasefire puts even more pressure on diplomats meeting in Cairo today to find a more durable settlement. Here\u2019s a snippet from AP on diplomatic efforts. Israeli and Palestinian delegations were expected to travel immediately to Cairo for talks moderated by the Egyptian government. It\u2019s not clear which other nations will be attending the talks, and aides to Kerry said Egypt will ultimately decide who will participate. It is expected that members of Hamas will be part of the Palestinian delegation named by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, although Egypt will have to serve as a go-between for the militants and Israel. Both the US and Israel consider Hamas a terrorist organisation and will not directly deal with the militant group. Over the last several weeks, diplomats from Qatar and Turkey have served as intermediators between the US and Hamas in a role that state department officials described as key in securing an agreement. Qatar, Turkey and Hamas all have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been outlawed in Egypt following last year\u2019s ousting in Cairo of former president Mohammed Morsi and his Brotherhood-led government. The US will be represented in Cairo by Frank Lowenstein, the State Department\u2019s top envoy to the Middle East. After falling short of winning a truce last week, Kerry left Cairo disappointed and, officials have said, angry but quietly soldiered on. Reuters is snapping that 25 people have been killed in Israeli shelling in southern Gaza, so the three-day humanitarian ceasefire is not much of one so far. The ceasefire seems to be unravelling fast, going by this tweet from Barak Ravid, Haaretz\u2019s diplomatic correspondent. The Associated Press reports that four Palestinians were killed in Rafah in southern Gaza this morning despite the ceasefire that took effect at 8am local time. Agence France-Presse says eight Palestinians died. Here\u2019s AP: Shortly before 10am Israeli tanks shelled the eastern part of the town of Rafah in southern Gaza, killing at least four people and wounding 15, said health ministry official Ashraf al-Kidra and Gaza police spokesman Ayman Batniji. An Israeli Army spokesman said a heavy exchange of fire had erupted in the Rafah area, without providing further details. This is AFP\u2019s version. But within hours an AFP journalist on the Israeli side of the border heard air raid sirens warning of a rocket attack, and the sound of outgoing Israeli artillery fire. Medics said eight people were killed in bombardment east of the town of Rafah, in southern Gaza, as heavy shelling of the area was heard. Israel immediately accused Hamas and other Gaza militants of committing a \u201cflagrant breach\u201d of the truce. Israeli tank and air fire killed 14 Palestinians in Gaza prior to Friday\u2019s ceasefire deadline, and the army said five of its soldiers died in mortar fire near the border with the Palestinian coastal enclave. My colleague Jason Burke, who is in Gaza, sent this earlier, just as the ceasefire took effect: Fishermen in Gaza City set out to sea for the first time since the war began as inhabitants tentatively left their homes, some for the first time for days. Queues formed for taxis. Most of those immediately on the streets were hoping to return to homes they had not seen for weeks, or salvage belongings. Grocery shops rapidly opened, selling basic foodstuffs. While most seemed optimistic and pleased that the ceasfire had been declared others remained defiant. Rocket fire from Hamas also continued until the ceasefire came into effect. Samira Attar, 27, a housewife, sitting in a donkey cart with her husband and five children and three mattresses, said she was heading back to her house in Atattraa, in the north of the strip. \u201cI am going back to my house for the first time for 17 days. I hope this ceasefire will hold for the whole 72 hours and longer, God willing. We don\u2019t need more bloodshed, or more devastation. I\u2019d like to see Israel to be defeated and broken but the circumstances were very difficult,\u201d Attar said. Harth Nassr, 34, a restaurant worker from Beit Hanoun, a heavily-hit village in the north east of the Gaza Strip, said he too was optimistic. \u201cI think it will hold this time. Everybody is tired of this war,\u201d he said. Nassr\u2019s home was destroyed after he evacuated following a warning from Israeli forces to leave the area. \u201cI left my house ten days ago. I went there only once in the last ten days and found the whole building, all three storeys, destroyed. I\u2019m going back today to see if I can get any of my belongings.\u201d However, others doubted that the war, in which 59 Israelis and more than 1,440 Palestinians, largely civilians, have died, was over. Isham Abu Ramadan, 42, said he was not optimistic: \u201cWe have long experience of Israel. They break the ceasefire all the time. They want to hit us more. They want more massacres. \u201cIsrael doesn\u2019t want to end the war as well as they don\u2019t want a peace settlement. I don\u2019t want a ceasefire. I want the resistance to fire until the end when Israel is defeated and asks for a truce,\u201d Ramadan, a construction worker who said his house was destroyed in an air strike earlier this month, told the Guardian. \u2022 Israel and Hamas begin a 72-hour ceasefire brokered by the US and UN. \u2022 At least four Palestinians are killed by tank fire after the ceasefire starts at 8am local time. \u2022 Delegations from Israel and Palestine due to convene in Cairo for negotiations to be mediated by the Egyptian government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
