With little to lose, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger certainly transmitted positivity. His selection of Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9, sounder defensively than the more enterprising Theo Walcott on the right, gave his full-back, Kolo Tour\u00e9, confidence to raid. Emmanuel Adebayor, linking the play brilliantly and enjoying the benefit of Alexander Hleb's wanderings behind him, found chances coming his way. Hleb was electric with his movement and continually found space, whereas neither Rio Ferdinand nor Gerard Piqu\u00e9 was getting tight enough to Adebayor. As a result Arsenal were able to pin United back and they might have led at the break. To Wenger's disappointment the tall Togolese striker could not finish. Arsenal were in no way downbeat after the emotion of last Tuesday's defeat at Liverpool. They should not worry about their future: with a fit Hleb, Tomas Rosicky to return, Cesc F\u00e1bregas's subtlety and the wonderfully improving Ga\u00ebl Clichy it is in good hands. They could well have won here had they taken their chances or had Edwin van der Sar, the busier goalkeeper, not saved Wes Brown and Ferdinand from own-goal embarrassments. United could not put enough consecutive passes together in the first period to introduce their full-backs into the attack. After half-time, and particularly when Adebayor somewhat luckily squeezed in Arsenal's opener, we awaited a response. Following United's penalty equaliser, William Gallas having been penalised for handball, we got it. Finally United threw off the shackles, went positive and the game crackled. Paul Scholes and Park Ji-sung were sacrificed for a more cavalier 4-4-2. Wayne Rooney, now with the indefatigable Carlos Tevez, benefited. The mood changed. Owen Hargreaves' free-kick winner may steal the headlines but it was United's second-half handling of Adebayor and Hleb that was more significant. Carrick tightened on the Belorussian forward, stopping the main supporting threat so effectively that Wenger pushed him wider when Nicklas Bendtner joined the fray. Alongside the Englishman, Anderson, fresher, ran gleefully from midfield to give F\u00e1bregas more defensive work. At the back Ferdinand and Piqu\u00e9, though never dominant in the air, went tighter with Adebayor who, deprived of service from Hleb, lost his freedom and faded. Ferguson used his substitutes with perfect timing but it was the subtle adjustments to stop Arsenal's forward rhythm that probably decided the outcome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
