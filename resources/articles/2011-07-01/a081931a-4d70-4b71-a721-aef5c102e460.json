Had they come to hear the solicitor general's measured condemnation of human trafficking? Certainly not. The swearing-in of Iain McKenzie, Labour's Inverclyde by-election winner? You must be joking, though they cheered him politely. What they were here for was to savour what the Sun would call a \"Gotcha\" moment when public ire has turned, not against MPs for once, but against their tormentors in the press, the people who expose their shortcomings (or invent them) and make their children cry. Most voters don't much care what phone hackers, blaggers and paparazzi do to MPs, to overpaid footballers, dodgy bankers or the tangled love lives of film stars. But they do care about the ordeal of murdered Milly Dowler's family. Such public revulsion happens only once in a decade \u2013 and does not last. It fell to Chris Bryant of tabloid Y-fronts fame to throw the brick through News International's window by successfully demanding an emergency debate over the Guardian's Dowler revelation. But plenty of colleagues had spent the afternoon throwing gravel, starting with Harriet Harman. Would Nick Clegg join her (\"Hotwheels Hattie\" to the hacks) in condemning this monstrous behaviour, she asked? He certainly would: it was \"beneath contempt\". Would he also support a public inquiry to \"clean up the British press\", thundered Hotwheels? Er, no. Clegg still thinks a police inquiry will suffice, bless him. It shows he has managed to keep a sense of humour. If Scotland Yard's inquiry pursues the evidence \"ruthlessly wherever it leads,\" as the DPM suggests, the boys in blue could find themselves bursting into David Cameron's Witney kitchen to feel the collars of Rebekah Brooks, Andy Coulson and other weekend cronies who know even less about the hacking conspiracy than Dave does. There again, perhaps not. The Yard has shown as strange a reluctance as successive prime ministers on four continents to cross News International's shadowy Australian Mr Big, the Ernst Blofeld of global media, whose white Persian cat, Sheila, is said to drink the blood of Sun readers' children. Mr Big would have to be caught personally hacking the Pope's voice mail (\"It's God here, Benny, please ring me back\") before being in trouble. That immunity does not extend to his associates. If ad revenue implodes and Blofeld starts stroking Sheila in a menacing way it may be time for Mrs Brooks to clear her desk. Yet one person did not hesitate yesterday to rattle Mr Big's gilded cage, whatever the risk to life or limb. His name? Mr Speaker, John Bercow. No sooner had Labour's Bryant completed his tremendous rant against the NoW \"playing God with a family's emotions\" than the Speaker declared unhesitatingly that, yes, he would grant an emergency debate later today if MPs so wished. It would have taken a brave, libertarian Tory to defend the press by trying to block the debate when even Cameron has jettisoned his mates from the relative safety of Afghanistan. None was available and as a wall of Labour MPs rose to endorse Bryant, a handful of Tories did likewise. They will not be named in this column. They have vulnerable families and mobile phones too. Hordes of reporters will have to settle for Bercow's bins. There can only be one explanation. Between the hacks, his Tory colleagues and Mrs Bercow's Twitter feed, the speaker's reputation may be beyond repair. There is nothing more they can do to harm him. It's an interesting theory. Good luck, Mr Speaker."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
