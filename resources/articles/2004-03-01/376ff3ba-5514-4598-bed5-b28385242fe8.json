Bournemouth University's annual Fantasy Budget competition for schoolchildren closes tomorrow, coinciding with the chancellor's budget announcement. Hundreds of 15 to 18-year-olds from schools all over the country have been mulling over what they would put in the little red box. This year's entries have an emphasis on food, a spokesperson for the university said. Children have proposed a tax on high-calorie content food and hidden sugar. One suggestion was to save all the tax from alcohol and cigarettes to spend on public gyms. Another school proposed an \"irresponsibility tax\" on vandals and people who litter, while another entry called for parents of truants to be taxed for every day their child takes off school without reason. And despite more children having mobile phones than ever, one school recommended that there should be a tax on text messages. Last year, Poole Grammar school won the competition for its plans to tax single drivers, encourage car pools and reduce pollution. The competition is in its eighth year - it has been running as long as Gordon Brown has been chancellor. A spokesperson for the university said: \"We teach tax, tax is boring. But it's important. We're trying to get kids excited about the idea.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
