Buttler suffered a hip injury when striking an almighty six into the river Taff off Mosaddek Hossain during England\u2019s total of 386 for six against Bangladesh. While he batted on, making 64 from 44 balls, the 28-year-old was in obvious discomfort when running between the wickets and did not emerge for the second innings, with Jonny Bairstow taking over the gloves. Speaking after the 106-run victory, Morgan said: \u201cThere\u2019s no serious concern at the moment. He\u2019s going to be monitored over the next 48 hours but at the moment it\u2019s more precautionary rather than not being able to do his job. I\u2019m quite confident that it\u2019s not a serious injury. \u201cWe\u2019ll use every day as much as we can to try to get him back on the park. If he is a risk going into the next game [in Southampton], it might not be worth it.\u201d Beyond concerns over Buttler, Morgan was effusive in his praise of Jason Roy, whose 121-ball 153 helped England pass the 338 for eight made in the 2011 tie against India in Bangalore for their highest World Cup total in history. The right-hander\u2019s ninth one-day century will once again give rise to talk of him entering England\u2019s thoughts for this summer\u2019s Ashes series, with his one-day captain confident his skills can indeed transfer over. Morgan said: \u201cHe\u2019s a luxury. He just goes on and gets big scores. They can range from 140 to 180 and the rate he gets them at is so difficult to defend. He scores all the way around the ground, he takes really good bowlers down and hits good balls for boundaries. He\u2019s great to have in the side. \u201cOne of his biggest strengths at the moment is his temperament. I\u2019ve said this before but I do think he could play Test cricket at some stage. He has every attribute to be a Test cricketer, whether that\u2019s now or in a couple of years\u2019 time is not for me to decide. He certainly has all the attributes.\u201d Morgan confirmed Moeen Ali was left out of the XI solely for tactical reasons \u2013 chiefly the ground\u2019s short boundaries \u2013 but his return later in the week could depend on matters at home, with the all-rounder\u2019s wife due to have their second child in the coming days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
