Vegetarian pizza", "bodyText": "So much was wrong with this week's halal pizza \"scandal\" that it's hard to know where to start. For one thing there was the crashing condemnation of ugly scenes in Muslim slaughter houses, unmatched by any curiosity about whether things are prettier in Christian abattoirs. For another, for a row supposed to be about food, it was striking that taste never got a mention: some foodies reckon that blood-drained halal carcasses yield a somewhat lighter taste than meats where the gore has settled into the tissue for a while. But surely the biggest slice of baloney were the protestations made on behalf of the beasts that Pizza Express's non-Muslim diners were happy to eat before they had clocked that these had ended their days in ritualistic style. The last halal hurricane, after all, beset Subway for ditching pork products from some stores. It brought outrage from all the same voices, and yet nobody could pretend that the pigs concerned would have preferred to stay on the menu. With some classes of cuisine, the right way to kill may always remain contentious, but with pizza, the easy escape route is not killing at all. Walnuts, aubergines, sun dried tomatoes and even fried eggs all lend texture and tang, and that's before we've got to the gamut of smoked, soft and blue rennet-free cheeses which can all add a dimension. Keep meat out of the pizza oven, and there is every chance that the product will not only be halal but kosher as well, while also placating the selectively squeamish of all faiths and none."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
