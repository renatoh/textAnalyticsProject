Yours what? Sincerely, hopefully, faithfully, truly, in haste, or just \"yours\"? Kind regards or regards ? Love and kisses, if you have a joking relationship? Then there's best - wishes, luck, regards, or just \"best\"? Is it best to put just your name? Kind regards seems to be the usual sign off in business, though it's flowery and most likely untrue. \"If you get an email without some note of esteem or whatever at the end, it does look terse and impersonal,\" says Ben, a recruitment interviewer. \"So I always put something, though it's just a matter of form.\" If you're a cake decorator, the dedicated ones always sign themselves \"yours in sugar\". Trust me - I used to work for a cake magazine. So that makes it easy for them - the rest of us still have to think about it. Should you put kisses after your signature to people you don't know, haven't met and are dealing with on a business basis? It depends on the industry - what might be OK in creative media is less so in utilities or security. Most people don't mind this sign-off from a woman they don't know and who doesn't know them, though they probably still find it surprising. But it's more disconcerting coming from an unknown man. Roguish, arch sign-offs are always a turn-off. Avoid \"over to you!\" or adding the phrase \"you guys\" (\"best to you guys over there!\") to anything. Terrible things like \"over and out\", \"roger\", \"keep the faith\" or even \" keep your eye on the prize\" still crop up. And \"keep smiling\" has been known to drive previously unflappable models of decorum into homicidal furies. I was taken aback by an email from a Famous Person, can't say who, when I asked for her address. She emailed back \"2 Posh Street, Oxford. Fast!\" I could almost smell her irritation. Well, we're all busy - she could have saved precious time by not adding the redundant adjective. Never try to give an impression of your fantastically busy life by your sign-off unless you want to show off. It doesn't take much longer to type \"yours\" than \"yrs\" or \"regards\" rather than \"regs\". \"Cheers!\" is beyond the pale - though I often use it if want to sound confident and, well, cheerful. If you want to be honest, \"yours wearily\" or \"yours pointlessly\" would be more like it - but never be sarcastic by email. Anything written down is taken more seriously by people than the things they hear. They can't hear your tone of voice which might be amused, jokey, affectionate - not mocking, cold and critical, as they imagine it. Respect the recipient's space, says Susan St Maur, author of Powerwriting (Prentice Hall Business, \u00a312 99). \"Knock before you enter, then be the perfect guest, remember to say please and thank you. Leave before you've worn out your welcome,\" she says. So don't use words in your email that you wouldn't use in person. Sometimes, the shortest exchange can be the most effective, like this one, said to be between Victor Hugo and his publisher after The Hunchback of Notre Dame was published and easily adaptable to our electronic age. Dear Paul ? Victor And the reply: Dear Victor ! Paul. So you see - you don't necessarily need a sign-off at all. Sign-off language \u00b7 If you mix typefaces and use a lot of icons in your sign-off, you risk coming across as unstable and immature. \u00b7 Underlining or putting things in caps too often can have a similar effect. \u00b7 Don't abbreviate the words in sign-offs. \u00b7 If signing by hand, your signature should be legible. \u00b7 A big signature is always better than a little one. \u00b7 Vary your sign-off occasionally so that your communications don't seem routine to recipients. \u00b7 Not to have a sign-off is OK as long as you include \"thanks\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
