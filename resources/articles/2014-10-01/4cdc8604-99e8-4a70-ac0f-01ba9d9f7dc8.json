What could possibly go wrong\u2026", "bodyText": "Last week I experienced a chilling illustration of the phrase \u201cNo publicity is bad publicity\u201d. I was reading about how David Nicholls, author of One Day, which, back in 2010, peppered many a British-holidaymaker-strewn poolside (making those poolsides deliciously seasoned with accessible fiction \u2013 it\u2019s fine, I\u2019m on top of this), and was subsequently made into a successful film starring that thin actress, you know the one. OK, I realise that hardly narrows down the options \u2013 they\u2019re narrowed down by the demands and constraints of a body-image-obsessed patriarchy, which insists they have no dinner. But yes, there are lots of thin actresses. But this one\u2019s really thin. Come on, you remember \u2013 she had that award-winning haircut in the miserable musical, same name as Shakespeare\u2019s wife. Something to do with a cottage. I\u2019d Google her if I had time. Anyway, she\u2019s in it. I feel I\u2019ve left a sentence open somewhere there \u2013 a dangling demi-clause (as when the Christmas float sped under the low bridge). Yes! That\u2019s it: David Nicholls was explaining to the Cheltenham literature festival why there was such a long gap between One Day and his latest novel, Us. Which wasn\u2019t that he refused to rush his new novel \u2013 it was that he didn\u2019t. Refuse to, that is. He did rush it, is what I\u2019m saying. What he specifically did was download a piece of software called Write or Die that requires you to bang the words out at a certain rate or it starts deleting them. Nicholls described it as like \u201cwriting with a gun to my head\u201d. It enabled him quickly to generate 35,000 unusable words. That\u2019s enough for another series of Top Gear. It sounds like a nightmare. Even though most writers have chosen their careers and, if they make a living, feel privileged to do so, the writing itself can be like a glowering, unapproachable chore. A post-party student flat\u2019s worth of washing up. Much pacing and procrastination is required as part of the process. But an app that converts it into a self-undoing chore if you don\u2019t get on with it must be the work of Satan. It\u2019s like washing-up that breeds, a tax return that turns into two tax returns if you don\u2019t fill it in today, a lawn that, if unmowed, reverts to the crown from which you then have to buy it back. Or an ungrouted bathroom wall that if\u2026 Actually, I suppose DIY already is like that \u2013 if you don\u2019t fix the dripping pipe or leaky roof now, the problem becomes bigger. A stitch in time saves nine. Et tu, sewing!? I always suspected there was something diabolical about it. So why, having heard all that, would I suddenly start using this software? Which I am doing, in case you hadn\u2019t guessed \u2013 maybe you hadn\u2019t. Maybe \u201cet tu, sewing\u201d struck you as my trademark crap. Maybe everything I write is this slapdash but usually it takes me all day. That \u201cusually\u201d was a risk, I can tell you. It usually takes me a moment or two to remember how to spell usually and that\u2019s time I can usually afford but not today \u2013 all that just cost me a paragraph. It was a cracker \u2013 wish I could remember it. I\u2019m writing at breakneck speed while being pursued by a terrifying invisible assailant. It\u2019s like the bit in The Day After Tomorrow where they have to run away from waves of super-freezing air and get as near as possible to a brazier before it catches up with them. And if you want a better simile than that, you\u2019ll have to ask someone who isn\u2019t in the grip of the process it\u2019s alluding to. And ditto if you don\u2019t like sentences ending in prepositions. Or containing \u201cditto\u201d. This is fraught. The answer to the question I vaguely remember recently posing (but daren\u2019t look back to check in case everything in between gets destroyed) is, like I said at the start before my hair went white, that no publicity is bad publicity. It\u2019s like the photos of horrendous facelifts that still drive an upturn in the cosmetic surgery business. Or someone saying \u201cDon\u2019t touch that \u2013 it\u2019s hot!\u201d Or Facebook. It\u2019s what killed the cat. I noticed something being mentioned, so I thought I\u2019d give it a go, despite not having heard well of it. I think I\u2019m beginning to understand why there\u2019s a drugs crisis. I\u2019ll leave it to the sub-editor to take that last paragraph out of caps. Apart from a sudden realisation of how Downton Abbey must get written, what am I going to take away from this experience other than my fee and a first official warning? Well, I can totally see why it doesn\u2019t work for novel-writing. There\u2019s no time to leaf back and remind yourself what the characters are called \u2013 which must be a key part of novel-writing, if novel-reading is anything by which to go (I\u2019m getting the hang of this). The first draft would be packed with references to \u201cThingy\u201d and \u201cYou know, the tall one who did the murder \u2013 whoops!\u201d It\u2019s all very forward-moving, like talking. Like a phone call rather than an email. If you realise you missed something out, you can only chuck it in late \u2013 you can\u2019t go back and make \u201chappy birthday\u201d the first thing you said. You have to correct earlier omissions with later inclusions \u2013 or, alternatively, just go with the flow, correcting nothing and being swept along in the direction of whatever you seem to be saying. I\u2019m beginning to suspect that a lot of newspaper columns get written like this. It explains both the terrifying rhetorical certainty of the barnstorming tabloid opinion piece \u2013 unwavering in its diatribe against toffs, scroungers, immigrants or career women \u2013 and the unashamed meandering of the colour supplement navel-gazer \u2013 \u201cOn Tuesday, I was popping to the shops and the car wouldn\u2019t initially start and I thought, \u2018There\u2019s an anecdote in this!\u2019 but then it did start so never mind\u2026\u201d Perhaps Write or Die is based on a secret Fleet Street contraption of the Victorian era \u2013 a sort of treadmill typewriter that required you to type at a certain speed or become ensnared in the printing machinery. The first \u201cred tops\u201d may have been so coloured by the blood of leader-writers who vacillated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
