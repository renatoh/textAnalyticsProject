The Parisian club are anxious to conclude the transfer by tomorrow, when the Brazilian forward is due to report back for a fortnight of pre-season training at Aix-les-Bains. The PSG president Francis Graille yesterday met his Real Madrid counterpart Florentino Perez, a United delegation including Sir Alex Ferguson, and the player's agent, with negotiations over the fee all but agreed. \"One way or another this transfer will be sorted out this week,\" said Graille, who confirmed there had been a late approach from Chelsea. \"We've been in contact with the interested clubs every day but it's not up to me to rush things. United will have to make a significant offer to persuade us to let Ronaldinho go and, at the moment, I have yet to receive that bid in writing.\" PSG, their transfer embargo lifted last week, are satisfied with the offer relayed to them by United officials and are anxious to raise funds so their new coach Vahid Halilhodzic can add to the squad, with around \u00a33.5m earmarked for Bordeaux's Portuguese international striker Pauleta. For his part Ronaldinho, who is enjoying a short break in Rio de Janeiro, has suggested to his brother and agent Roberto Assis that he may not report for PSG's training camp if he has not sealed a move by then. Both would prefer not to have to resort to such drastic action, however. Blackburn Rovers are hoping to complete the signing of the Australian international Brett Emerton today after the player underwent a medical at Ewood Park. The Rovers chief executive John Williams has already agreed a fee with Feyenoord of around \u00a32.75m for the 24-year-old, with Graeme Souness confident he can beat off any late interest from the midfielder's other long-term suitors - most notably Newcastle - to sign him as a replacement for the departed David Dunn. Blackburn's other Australian, the full-back Lucas Neill, has agreed a contract extension to stay at Rovers until the summer of 2007. The Wolves manager Dave Jones has maintained the Ukrainian connection at Molineux in making his second signing of the close season by recruiting Isaac Okoronkwo from Shakhtar Donetsk. The 25-year-old Nigerian international central defender follows the Ukranian international and former Arsenal defender Oleg Luzhny into the club and has agreed a one-year contract. Jones is set to unveil his third newcomer today and also expects the former Manchester United pair Denis Irwin and Paul Ince to commit themselves to the club for another year. The Northern Ireland winger Keith Gillespie has agreed a two-year deal with the Premiership newcomers Leicester City, having been released by Blackburn. The out-of-contract former Manchester United and Newcastle player completed a medical at Walkers Stadium yesterday. \"He is an experienced Premiership player and will fit into the way we want to play,\" said the Leicester manager Micky Adams. The sports minister Richard Caborn has written to the Luton chief executive John Gurney to express his concern at recent events at the Second Division club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
