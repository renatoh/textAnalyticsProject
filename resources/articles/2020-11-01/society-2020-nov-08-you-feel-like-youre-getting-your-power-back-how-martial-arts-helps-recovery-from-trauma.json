She had signed up to coach Claire Hayes\u2019s new six-week course of trauma-informed Brazilian jiu-jitsu, as someone who has survived trauma herself. But she also had her professional hat on, because Nikki works with those who have suffered trauma. She wondered if rolling and grappling was really a good idea. \u201cI thought, how is jiu-jitsu going to work?\u201d Nikki said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of contact, a lot of risk. But actually, particularly if you\u2019ve been a victim of a crime where you\u2019ve lost your power, it teaches you to use your opponent\u2019s strength against them. You feel like you\u2019re getting your power back.\u201d You\u2019ve probably heard of trauma-informed yoga, developed in 2002 at the Justice Resource Institute\u2019s Trauma Center in Massachusetts to help survivors get a greater sense of mind-body connection. Now, trauma-informed martial arts is on the rise. Psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk, a trauma treatment expert who wrote the best-selling book The Body Keeps the Score, believes martial arts to be among the best treatments for traumatic stress because they reinstate a sense that the individual \u201cis not a helpless tool of fate\u201d. Hayes\u2019s journey began when she founded the website Grapple Isle while still a white belt, having seen the need for a central BJJ community in Tasmania. But her plan was always to develop a program that helped people who had experienced trauma, including sexual violence. It\u2019s open to anyone who identifies as a woman who has experienced trauma. \u201cYou get control back over your own body and you realise that it can do things you never knew it could do,\u201d Hayes tells Guardian Australia. The group might start off with grip breaks, but it\u2019s always in the context of jiu-jitsu as a sport, rather than as self-defence, which might be triggering. \u201cWe don\u2019t say, \u2018Okay, if someone on the street grabs you by the wrist, this is what you do\u2019,\u201d Hayes says. She\u2019s also mindful that bodies can be as traumatised as minds. \u201cI have a lot of injuries from my trauma,\u201d says Nikki, \u201cso my body doesn\u2019t move in ways that it used to, but BJJ is about being adaptable and keeping your injuries safe.\u201d By week three, Hayes\u2019s first group was keen to progress to throws and takedowns. She\u2019s had to hit pause while Covid-19 restrictions are in place, but she\u2019s creating an evidence-based course framework that could be rolled out by other gyms, and has already had interest as far away as Canada. Closer to home, in Melbourne, is exercise scientist Georgia Verry\u2019s trauma-informed kickboxing practice, The Fight Back Project. During the pandemic she\u2019s gone national by delivering the course via Zoom. Verry is herself a Muay Thai fighter, and tells Guardian Australia that she heard the phrase \u201cfighting saved my life\u201d so frequently on the scene that she started The Fight Back Podcast in parallel to her course to explore that concept. Her guests are either fighters who have experienced mental health issues, or researchers and practitioners interested in the field of martial arts and mental health. As for the course, the kickboxing movements \u2013 carried out via shadow boxing, or on bags or with pads \u2013 are used to bolster confidence and assertiveness. Other components draw on meditation, a stretching routine and somatic experiencing, which analyses the bodily sensations that come up with emotional triggers and tries to expand a person\u2019s window of tolerance. \u201cThe classic analogy is when dogs are hit by a car, they get up and physically shake,\u201d she says. \u201cHumans don\u2019t do that. Their response might be to cry, but you get told to move on and to not be a baby. So I want to help people release the stored emotion that came from something traumatic.\u201d Jessie, a 31-year-old from Sydney\u2019s inner west, was referred to Verry by her psychologist. Her mother died when she was five and she was shunted between families, being sexually abused along the way. When she was 18 she was sexually assaulted on a number of occasions, although she hardly recognised it as such, having been groomed to expect it. She wound up turning to ice use. \u201cI always saw myself as the instigator of these situations, as though I was causing people to behave in this way,\u201d she says. \u201cI took responsibility. I didn\u2019t know what my boundaries were and I couldn\u2019t say no.\u201d Verry\u2019s course has helped Jessie to assert her aggression and express anger, but she\u2019s also got a lot out of the grounding techniques that follow the high-intensity interval training. \u201cGrounding creates a space and time to come back into our bodies,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe come back to our breathing or touch the ground. Sometimes we\u2019ll feel our pulse in our neck. For me, that is setting a boundary for keeping myself safe, because sometimes in exercise I go so hard that I can disassociate or injure myself.\u201d Jessie appreciates the sense of mastery that can come with learning martial arts, which makes these trauma-informed courses so different to self-defence workshops. \u201cThere\u2019s an implicit statement in self-defence that you WILL be attacked at some stage, so you\u2019d better be ready to defend yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cMartial arts make you feel more powerful because you have a skill.\u201d Seventeen per cent of women and 4.3% of men in Australia have experienced sexual violence. When you consider those statistics, it\u2019s unsurprising that everyone Guardian Australia spoke to believed that all martial arts instructors should have trauma-informed experience. \u201cReceiving education surrounding trauma \u2013 what it is, what it looks like, what the short and long term impacts are \u2013 is immensely beneficial,\u201d says Nikki. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying in my field that as long as you are trauma-informed in everything you do, you will never do any harm.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
