It has to be one of the most beautiful and romantic countries in the world. The best thing: There are two - Capri and Sicily. My perfect day: I would spend it on Capri, arriving in style from Naples by private yacht, and spend the rest of the day strolling around the wonderful shops. My advice: If you are going to stay on Capri, then travel light. Some hotel porters have to pull your luggage up to the top of the hill by handcart, so unless you want to exhaust them it's best to only take a couple of suitcases. Getting there: Cheapflights (cheapflights.com) has flights from Gatwick to Naples from \u00a399 return. Ferries run between Naples and Capri. Where was your best holiday? When I was a teenager, I stayed with my aunt in Cannes. I spent all my time partying on the beach. I've been writing about it ever since! What is the best hotel you have stayed in? The Four Seasons, New York (001 212 758 5700, fourseasons.com/newyorkfs/). It's very clean, modern and art deco. Where do you want to go next? I'd like to return to Capri. What do you never travel without? A CD player, make-up and several cameras. \u00b7 Jackie Collins's latest novel is Deadly Embrace (Simon &amp; Schuster, \u00a316.99)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
