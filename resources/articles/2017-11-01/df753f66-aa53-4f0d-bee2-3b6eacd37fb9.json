We are speaking shortly before her Jarman win is made public. Ashery has just staged, in the run-up to the announcement, a short fragment of her ongoing project NoNothing Salons in the Dark, a series of collaborative storytelling works, at the Whitechapel gallery, London. The fragment contained stories of Syrian refugees and the people trying to help them, recorded in a darkened room in Thessaloniki, Greece, earlier this year. \u201cI was interested in how people work together,\u201d she explains, \u201ctelling stories in a darkened room. Even if no one speaks, that is a story, too.\u201d In her 12-part, web-based video series Revisiting Genesis, we meet an artist with cystic fibrosis and a painter who has had cancer, as well as carers, friends and curators. Ashery herself is an absent presence. Like a lot of people born in the 60s, she began to feel a level of disillusionment with political struggle and asked herself what alternatives there might be, what fights to turn to. \u201cEmotionally,\u201d she says, \u201cI felt a move into political melancholia. Melancholia can be a kind of withdrawal. In Revisiting Genesis, there is a sense that partial withdrawal can be a response to artistic overproduction and the culture that drives us so hard. Artists can never stop. You always have to self-present. You are always \u2018on\u2019. If you are not, it is as though you are dead.\u201d Genesis Revisited looks at the modern death industry. Vulnerable people with limited life expectancy are encouraged to clean up their online profiles and accounts, to create immortal, virtual avatars \u2013 and to buy tombstones that can deliver slideshows of the deceased to tablets or smartphones. It also presents us with IT companies that offer \u201cemotional wills\u201d, recording messages to be released up to 25 years into the future. Creating and editing a posthumous online presence, the sales pitch says, can be part of preparing yourself for the end. Is this for real? \u201cIt is all real,\u201d Ashery says. \u201cIt is a way of making money, especially from vulnerable people who are dying.\u201d These are fantasies of a kind of immortality, the prospect of extinction, and the probability that one might be forgotten, being difficult for people to deal with. At one point, we meet a guitarist who plays personalised songs to the dying. This kind of succour I can die without. I want no feelgood slideshows, no tidying up of my own messy online existence, no mawkish troubadours at my bedside. \u201cThe way we live is the way we die,\u201d she says. \u201cThe way poor people die. Black people, women, gay people. Dying alone, or not. It is all extremely political.\u201d She tells me about a conversation she had with a doctor who runs an interfaith hospice in London. \u201cHe told me that Jews and Muslims die a lot louder than English Christians, who die politely.\u201d At the height of the Aids crisis, she says, the artist David Wojnarowicz asked: \u201cWhy should we die politely?\u201d We should, he said, die with rage. Ashery recorded nurses involved in palliative care, discussing how they deal with their own grief at losing patients with whom they have developed relationships. \u201cThe only thing I asked the nurses to talk about was the breaks they have together with a cup of tea. It gives them a time out, to reflect and to talk. Otherwise, they get burnt out.\u201d This is one of the most affecting sections of the Revisiting Genesis project. \u201cWe live in a reality that is increasingly fictional,\u201d says Ashery. \u201cGenesis is really my story. The death of my brother and of several artists I know all influenced it.\u201d The loss of social infrastructure and the welfare state are deaths, too, she says. Revisiting Genesis works on lots of levels. It is funny, excruciating, embarrassing, confessional, filled both with candour and fantasy, history and play. The project is as idiosyncratic, as baggy and complex as any Derek Jarman film. In one episode, the many personas of Latvian-born, 20th-century sculptor Dora Gordine and Amy Winehouse collide. The Genesis character somehow inhabits both of them. What a strange work this is. Ashery wants to spend the next year writing about the implications of the project. She is also fascinated by the trial and imprisonment of Gayle Newland, convicted this year \u2013 after two trials \u2013 of deceiving her girlfriend into believing that she was a man. It was a bizarre case of deception and mistaken identity \u2013 and rich artistic territory for Ashery to get involved in. \u201cWhat about all those women who live with secret policemen,\u201d she says, \u201cand never know their real identities?\u201d How we live and die are remembered and recorded, our self-inventions and our disappearances are all part of Revisiting Genesis. The last episode of the film consists of a long prayer, a song written by Ashery. \u201cSuddenly my secular Jewishness came in,\u201d she says. \u201cThe song is a Kaddish. Suddenly it was great to pray.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
