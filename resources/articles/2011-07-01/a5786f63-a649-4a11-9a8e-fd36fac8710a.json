I haven't met him, but I hope he has a sense of humour, or at least a sense of irony. It was barely three weeks ago that the general flew to London to meet the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Sir Paul Stephenson. He'd travelled to the UK to discuss ideas about how to regenerate his police force, which has been riddled with corruption over the years. He is trying to clean it up. Who better to ask for ideas than Stephenson? After their talks, and with no sense of false modesty, the commissioner told reporters: \"New Scotland Yard is a natural place for foreign police chiefs to visit given the international reputation of the Metropolitan police.\" Fast forward three weeks and Stephenson has quit, so has his assistant commissioner, John Yates, and the Met is in turmoil over the phone-hacking scandal. I wonder if General Angar will spare a thought for them later today, when he takes his place among the other dignitaries to celebrate the \"transition\" of Lashkar Gah to the control of Afghan security forces. There are lots of odd things here that I don't think I fully understand. For instance \u2013 the children around Laskhar Gah like to throw rocks and stones at British army vehicles when they drive through town. I was told by one officer that this was a sort of sport. It's not because they didn't like the Brits, but because they like throwing stones. Particularly when they know they can get away with it. They don't just lob little things from the roadside, they use catapults to sling rocks from behind walls \u2013 hard enough to crack the windows on bomb-proof, heavily armed vehicles, like the Husky. And why does the mobile phone network go down every night at 7pm, and come back on at 7am the next morning? There are two theories \u2013 it's either for security reasons, or it's because the Taliban have told the network that if they don't, they will become a target. Nobody seems entirely sure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
