You know the sort: biceps the size of genetically modified grapefruits, voiceover by Kurt Russell or Mel Gibson, enough ammunition to sustain permanent ultraviolence until the game-over music pipes up. In reality, the man responsible for drug-testing Norwegian athletes for nearly a decade is serious beyond his 32 years. Which makes the hot whiff of anger and revelation in his new book, Den Store Dopingbloffen \u2013 The Great Doping Bluff, all the more pungent. Drange says that \"you have to be stupid to fail a test at a major tournament\". That \"there is neither the resources, expertise nor willingness to take hold of cheating in sport\". And, the dill sauce on the smoked salmon, that \"the system has failed\". His frustration, he says, stems from finding evidence of EPO and blood transfusions in Norwegian athletes' profiles between 2000 and 2009 but being unable to prosecute cases. But Anders Solheim, the head of Anti-Doping Norway, insists: \"If we had received good enough evidence we would have prosecuted the athletes through the prosecution committee.\" The World Anti-Doping Agency, meanwhile, is yet to comment. Drange is big news in Norway, a nation that finished fourth in the medal table at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, but his critique is global. He claims some national bodies are not rigorous enough with their testing for fear of what they might find, and that the anti-doping system is both ineffective and serves as an alibi for sport's reputation. He not only admonishes the International Olympic Committee and World Anti\u2011Doping Agency, but also himself. \"After years as a full-time doping hunter, I sat with a sneaking feeling that I had wasted several years of being a useful idiot for the sport's own reputation,\" he writes. \"With some notable exceptions most anti-doping organisations are without the skills to expose those who cheat.\" This is strong stuff. Or at least it should be. In a journalistic variant of what goes on in Vegas stays in Vegas, what's news in Norway is rarely news anywhere else. Not everyone in anti\u2011doping is as doomy as Drange but there is agreement that the guerilla war against cheats is not getting any easier. Certainly Wada is not the drug-busting sporting interpol that is often assumed. How can it be when its budget for 2014 is just over \u00a316m \u2013 equivalent to the combined wages of Stoke City's first XI last season? And when, in effect, it is forced to act like the well-intentioned sheriff of a wild west frontier town: God-honest values and a Colt 45 single action revolver only go so far when your gun is not fully loaded, you haven't enough staff and you don't always have jurisdiction. In the United States, for instance, Wada has no power over the major league sports. In the NFL players are banned for only four matches for a first performance enhancing drug offence and there is no human growth hormone testing. It leaves a gaping hole in the defensive line. Another lurking fear is that some sports are pushing back against Wada because they fear its investigations paint them in a bad light. In November the IAAF president, Lamine Diack, was extraordinarily critical, accusing Wada of mounting a \"ridiculous campaign\" against Jamaica and Kenya, saying: \"They went to Jamaica and what did they find? Nothing. We have to be clear on that.\" Diack's remarks deserved more traction than they got, especially given Renee Anne Shirley, the former executive director of the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission (Jadco), had revealed that only one random test was conducted on the island between March and July 2012, and that Jadco had no Whereabouts Information Officer to keep track of its athletes out of competition. Wada was not mounting a ridiculous campaign, it was doing its job. The latest incarnation of Wada's code calls for anti-doping organisations to devote more resources to gathering intelligence, so that those who supply banned substances can be infiltrated and brought to justice. In short, fewer in-competition urine tests and more private dicks. The change in emphasis makes sense: look at the Balco scandal or the United States' Anti-Doping Agency's investigation into Lance Armstrong. Sometimes big targets need large investigations. If you are a smart doper you are unlikely to be caught weeing into a pot at a major championship. But finding highly skilled investigative specialists is not easy, especially when many organisations are having their funding sliced. United Kingdom Anti-Doping, widely recognised as a leading example of best practice, will have had its budget cut from \u00a36.45m in 2010 to \u00a34.69m by 2015. That is not so much a haircut as a close-skulled going-over with clippers. It means more cheats may slip through. So what can be done? Asking the public to pay more to address this funding gap isn't on, even if the economic clouds are lifting. But a small levy on TV rights deals to finance the fight against sporting corruption in its many guises and disguises might, even if the practicalities are not easy to wade through. Meanwhile, if nothing else, Drange's book reminds us that one of the most fundamental questions in sport is this: do we trust what we see. That he fears that the interminable wrestle between tester and cheat, light and dark, isn't going particularly well should chill us all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
