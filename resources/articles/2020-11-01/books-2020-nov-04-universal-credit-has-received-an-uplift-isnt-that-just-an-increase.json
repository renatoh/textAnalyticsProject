The media dutifully mentioned the \u201cuplift\u201d, but when did it become impermissible to say simply \u201craise\u201d or \u201cincrease\u201d? It was the American writer Nathaniel Parker Willis, friend of Edgar Allan Poe, who first used \u201cuplift\u201d as a compound noun in 1845, in a poem describing the baby prophet Nathan\u2019s presentation to King David: \u201cHis brow / Had the inspired up-lift of the king\u2019s.\u201d In the following decade geologists described how land could be subject to \u201cuplift\u201d over time. Not until the mid-20th century was it adopted in business to mean (at first) an increase in prices, and therefore profits \u2013 as in the fees charged to the government by Serco. Perhaps the government hopes that by causing everyone to refer to an \u201cuplift\u201d in universal credit, they will seed the idea that their policies are uplifting in the happy-making sense (from the late 19th century). Meanwhile scientists have been keeping a close eye in recent years on \u201cuplifts\u201d in Yellowstone Park, caused by fresh magma deep in the supervolcano. A new mega-eruption would surely be very 2020. \u2022 Steven Poole\u2019s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
