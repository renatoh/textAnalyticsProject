The main problem was that I went out and didn\u2019t come home. I\u2019d go on these benders that were incredibly destructive to my wellbeing. And then when I was working, I\u2019d never leave the house. I\u2019d just sit in front of the laptop thinking about all the work I had to do, moping, writing, moping again. I felt frozen in time. Unable to move forward. There are some things you don\u2019t question because they\u2019re family lore and in my family it was that you can\u2019t have a dog in London. But when I met my boyfriend and we got a flat together, I realised I really, really wanted a dog. After many failed attempts, we found a man who was getting rid of a lurcher. The night before we met him, I was out and someone offered me drugs. I said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m getting a dog in the morning.\u201d They looked at me like, \u201cSo?\u201d But it felt massive to me. That morning, my boyfriend and I drove to a place near the M25 to meet the man with the lurcher. The dog walked towards us and was a bit sad-looking, really dirty and smelled terrible. But he was still so elegant and funny, too. It was exciting having this other little soul come into our tiny orbit. I put myself on \u201cpeternity leave\u201d and Wolfy, as we called him, and I just hung out for a while. We\u2019d go for lunch together and on lots of walks. He loved it. Obviously he\u2019s simple, he\u2019s an animal, but his presence pulled me out of myself and centred me back to a calm part of myself. I was 45 and had worked as a freelancer in London for 25 years and was pretty hardened. But he softened me and helped me love unconditionally. I now had a reason to come home at night. I still went to parties, but in a less destructive way. Sometimes I\u2019d take him with me and he\u2019d just look at me like, \u201cWhat the fuck? Let\u2019s go home.\u201d And I\u2019d be like, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d It\u2019s been an ongoing thing since then to disentangle from doing things that harm me. And to do things that make my short time on this earth joyful and positive; Wolfy is my daily lesson in how to live that life. Kate Spicer\u2019s book Lost Dog: A Love Story is published by Ebury.

Our family immediately loved her, but she didn\u2019t necessarily show that she loved us back. She didn\u2019t like being picked up or cuddled. Everything was on her terms. In April 2013, when she was less than one year old, we were all playing on the floor when she jumped on my chest and I thought, \u201cOoh, that hurt a little.\u201d After that, whenever I was lying down she\u2019d lie on me and paw at this one spot on my right breast. If I moved her paw, she\u2019d put it back in the same place. If I was sitting down, she\u2019d get up on my lap and nudge her head there. She started following me around everywhere. She wasn\u2019t like that with anyone else. It was three months of that behaviour before I admitted it wasn\u2019t going to stop. I knew it sounded crazy to go to the doctor and say, \u201cMy cat keeps bothering me,\u201d but I had some discomfort, too. The doctor found atypical cells and calcification in the same spot Missy had been nudging. It wasn\u2019t full-blown breast cancer, but it had the potential to change, so I had an operation to remove the cells. I felt so grateful to Missy; I wouldn\u2019t have gone to the doctor if it hadn\u2019t been for her. I\u2019d heard of dogs doing that kind of thing, but not cats. When I got home I rewarded her with some Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s prawns \u2013 rather than the Asda ones that she\u2019s used to. As my wound healed she backed off and went back to her aloof self. It was weird for me. I felt like maybe she didn\u2019t love me as much any more. I was back to being treated like everyone else. But I was comforted that there was a reason for her behaviour. One night two years later, she came and lay on my chest in bed. I said to my partner: \u201cDo you think she\u2019s trying to tell me something?\u201d He laughed it off. But the next night was the same. She started following me again. It was really unsettling. I\u2019d got used to her barely bothering to get off the bed. When I went back to the same doctor with no symptoms other than my cat pestering me I had to plead with her to believe me. She sent me to the hospital and I was given the same diagnosis and they did the same operation again. It was the same consultant and team. They were fantastic \u2013 and believed me. Not everyone does, but that\u2019s up to them. Two years later when it all happened a third time, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. There were eight areas of calcification in my breast. I had a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery and they removed the lymph nodes. That was 2017. Thankfully, Missy\u2019s been consistently aloof since then and I\u2019ve been fine. I know it sounds strange but I feel as if she saved my life. She will forever be my hero, whether she likes it or not. \u2018After I lost everything, he made life worth living\u2019: Ben Coles, 33, unemployed, and Biggie the iguana, 4, Chippenham, Wiltshire When I first got Biggie, I had a job, a house, a girlfriend. He was six months old and about 18in long. But about six months into having him, I went through a bad spell of mental health. As a result, I lost my job, then my house, broke up with my girlfriend, and was almost declared bankrupt. Everything just toppled on me. I had anxiety and I was very easily irritated. I don\u2019t blame them, but my family and friends eventually became sick of me. It felt like Biggie was the only being not giving me grief and I just felt this closeness to him. But it was a struggle for me to keep hold of him. No landlords wanted to take us in and I was left homeless. People hear \u201ciguana\u201d and they think, \u201cOh God, it\u2019s going to rip everything apart.\u201d I spent three months living on my mum\u2019s sofa, paying friends to look after Biggie. I fell out with my mum for not taking him in. For a period, he lived in Bristol and I went back and forth every day to see him, because obviously all the moving and being apart from each other was stressful for the lizard as well. I\u2019d lost everything in my life, but he was my partner in crime and the only thing I was living for. I can\u2019t imagine how much harder that time would have been without him. Keeping him alive saved my life. Eventually I got a place in Chippenham. He\u2019s grown to four-and-a-half-foot long now. He thinks he\u2019s a cat and just loves attention. When I do the dishes, he comes and sits on my head. If I turn my face, he\u2019ll give me a little lick on the lips. With certain people he\u2019ll climb up their leg and sit and stare at them until they start stroking him. When he outgrew his vivarium, I set out basking areas with UV lights, and now he roams free around the house. I bathe him twice a day because he\u2019s a rainforest lizard. He makes a fuss to get in the tub, but loves it once he\u2019s in. My girlfriend works in an expensive supermarket and Biggie loves their fruit, which is quite a pricey habit. His favourite is Candyfloss grapes. At night, he sits on my chest and I put my dressing gown over us. Luckily, my girlfriend loves him, too. \u2018Trixie helps me control my obsessive thoughts\u2019: Stephanie Lynch, 25, civil servant, and Trixie the hamster, 1, Port Talbot, Wales So often in my life I feel like what I say or what I do is going to have a grave consequence, but with Trixie I don\u2019t feel that way. When I shut the bedroom door to be with her, she\u2019s so present in the room, everything else just goes away. I have OCD which stems from guilt towards a lot of things. As a child, my family had a house fire and one of my little brothers passed away. After that, if I heard a noise in the night, I had to sit up to check everything was OK; if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d feel like there would be another fire. I became obsessed with thinking about accidents. Every 10 minutes I was imagining falling and would have the physical feeling you get just before you fall. It was about me, my boyfriend, anyone around me. But Trixie helped change that. Late last summer, I started medication and got her not long afterwards. Hamsters need a lot of care and having a positive impact on her through feeding, changing her bedding, just making the right choices, really helped me. Watching Trixie play, sniff around, climb all over me, I found myself smiling on my own, which is not something I do. It was such a light feeling of joy. And a break from my thoughts. Our boxroom is her room now. I love changing her cage. I think, \u201cWell, what might she find interesting?\u201d I know her different moods and have learned her favourite treat is watermelon. I still get the obsessive thoughts, but I can choose to let them go and think of Trixie. She doesn\u2019t know how much she means to me. Or how I feel. But that doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s something to be said for getting comfort from another being without telling them why you\u2019re upset. Obviously I know hamsters don\u2019t live forever and hate the thought of her dying, but I know I\u2019m giving her the best life possible. And she gives me so much back. \u2018I felt so isolated, but he helped connect to the world\u2019: Majid Sohrabi, 49, and Oxford the dog, 5, Alexandria, Dumbertonshire The first time I saw Oxford he was a puppy. I thought, \u201cHe needs someone to look after him; how\u2019s he going to help me?\u201d But within months, he had changed my life. I can\u2019t bend down any more so when I drop things, which is all the time, he picks them up. He helps me get dressed. If I ask him, he gets the landline phone. He kind of stands and puts his paws around the handset and then grabs it with his jaws, very gently. It\u2019s especially helpful when I\u2019ve had a fall. Back in 2010, I was working as a nurse in Glasgow and writing my dissertation for my master\u2019s when I started to get this feeling like I had cushions under my heels, within days it turned into unbearable pain. I was having lunch with my girlfriend when I realised I couldn\u2019t stand up on my own. Later that year I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Physically, the disease made me uncoordinated and I became unstable. I had to give in to using a wheelchair. To me, it felt like the end of the road. I used to love cycling from Glasgow to Loch Lomond and running. I couldn\u2019t stand looking out of the window at people going about their normal life. My girlfriend and I broke up and my family were all in Tehran. I had to move out of the city to find a bungalow. I didn\u2019t know anyone in my new town and just spent my time on my own behind the computer watching movies. My physiotherapist suggested I get a dog through the charity Canine Partners. Oxford was key to reconnecting me to the world. He made me get out of the house to take him for walks. I started sailing and playing wheelchair basketball. He\u2019s changed my body image, too. When I used to go shopping I felt like this strange thing everyone was staring at in the middle of the shopping centre. When you\u2019re at a lower level to everyone else, you can think of yourself as not a part of society. But with him next to me, more people say hello or approach me and ask about him. His foster parents, from when he was a puppy, Jan and Peter, live in Sussex and we\u2019ve become close. They come to visit us once a year and we travel around Scotland. I can\u2019t believe how pessimistic I was before I got him. He\u2019s my best mate and we\u2019ve become a great team. Majid has received support from the MS Society"}, "isHosted": false}}}
