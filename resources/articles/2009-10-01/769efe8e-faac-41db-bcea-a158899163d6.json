The letter to Prince Faisal, a senior member of Jordan's royal family who is a close adviser to Vatanen's campaign, was introduced to a conference of motorsport governing bodies in Amman. Responding to Vatanen \u2013 who is opposing Mosley's favoured candidate, Jean Todt \u2013 and his claims of FIA \"autocracy\", Mosley wrote: \"Any thoughts that after this election everyone in motorsport can unite and work together can now be forgotten. It is not possible to make statements like Vatanen's and then expect the victims of those insults to forget what has been said. The simple fact is that Vatanen will lose the election and lose badly, not least because he chose to denigrate the FIA and those currently in office.\" Prince Faisal expressed his \"grave concerns\" at \"the insinuations of this letter\". Observers of the electoral campaign were taken aback by the strength of Mosley's conviction that Todt will win the election, given that it is a secret ballot which as outgoing president he will oversee. And there was a storm of protest from within the conference, where Mosley's tone towards a senior royal, who is also president of the Jordanian Olympic committee, raised hackles. Arsenal's lose Friar power Football will soon lose one of its most loyal servants as Ken Friar turns his thoughts to retirement. The Arsenal director has spent an almost unbroken 60 years with the club after being taken on by the then secretary-manager, Tom Whittaker, as a teenager. Since that time Friar has occupied a number of senior roles at the north London club, rising to the position of managing director. Most recently he has worked on the Highbury Square redevelopment, but with the project now officially launched and its senior loan refinanced, he is preparing to step down, six weeks after his 75th birthday The chairman, Peter Hill-Wood, has been trying to persuade Friar not to leave the club but he seems determined to do so on his own terms. Bloody nonsense Lawrence Dallaglio is a hard man who deals with hard facts. \"I played 16 years and I never saw anything like the Harlequins incident,\" said the former England No8 when fronting the Rugby Football Union task force's post-Bloodgate verdict about cheating in the game. Strictly speaking, Dallaglio is right. Indeed he never \"saw\" anything like a man chewing on a joke-shop blood capsule in order to get himself replaced, as Harlequins' Tom Williams did last season. But we have only to turn to p155 of Dallaglio's autobiography, released a little over two years ago, to find out that he knew more than he was letting on. Speaking of a Wasps game against Bath in April 1997, Dallaglio recalled how the kicker Jon Callard's introduction as a blood replacement was engineered. \"I was subsequently told by a Bath player that no one was cut; they just dabbed a bit of ketchup on a player, rushed him off the field and got Callard on,\" he wrote. \"Hey ho, you do what you have to do to win.\" Owen's horse code They say it matters more when there's money on it. Well there's more than money at stake in the 8.20 at Wolverhampton tonight, where Supercast goes up against Uncle Bertie. The intrigue in the outing lies in the fact that Supercast is Nicky Vaughan's first runner since he was given the boot by Michael Owen at Manor House \u2013 where Uncle Bertie is stabled. Revenge is on the race cards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
