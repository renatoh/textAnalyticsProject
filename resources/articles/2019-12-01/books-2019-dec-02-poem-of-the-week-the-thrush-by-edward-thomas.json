I hear the thrush, and I see Him alone at the end of the lane Near the bare poplar\u2019s tip, Singing continuously. Is it more that you know Than that, even as in April, So in November, Winter is gone that must go? Or is all your lore Not to call November November, And April April, And Winter Winter \u2013 no more? But I know the months all, And their sweet names, April, May and June and October, As you call and call I must remember What died into April And consider what will be born Of a fair November; And April I love for what It was born of, and November For what it will die in, What they are and what they are not, While you love what is kind, What you can sing in And love and forget in All that\u2019s ahead and behind. The first thing that seems unusual in this apparently traditional \u201cnature poem\u201d is the use of the verb \u201cread\u201d and its application to the months. The metaphorical meaning of read is probably more familiar to us than it was to Edward Thomas\u2019s audience: at least it feels strangely contemporary in our age of \u201cecopoetry\u201d: we have grown used to poets, though not thrushes, reading landscape as varieties of text. Thomas goes on to respond to the bird in a more traditional way, through hearing and sight. There\u2019s a beautifully precise and poignant description of the exact spot the thrush is occupying, \u201calone at the end of the lane / Near the bare poplar\u2019s tip\u201d. Then the grammatical perspective seems to shift, and the first person narrative about the bird (\u201cI hear the thrush\u201d) shifts to the vocative. Who else, in stanza three, could the \u201cyou\u201d refer to? So the first stanza asks to be reread, and the second seems to become parenthetical. . Thomas was seemingly addressing the thrush, not only the reader or himself, in that first, quatrain-length question. The question arises for the speaker because the bird doesn\u2019t obviously \u201cread\u201d any difference: he sings on regardless, in November as in April. Thomas may partly be conducting the conversation with himself, of course. At heart, the poem is an inquiry into different modes of consciousness, and how differently a bird and a person may perceive things. The thrush may know that winter will give way to spring, or simply not be influenced by the seasons as humans know them. His more instinctive \u201clore\u201d (the term is perfectly chosen) may not include such distinctions. The speaker has a sharper knowledge, closer, perhaps, to \u201claw\u201d. He can name the months, and chants his litany of favourites in stanza five: \u201cBut I know the months all, / And their sweet names, April, / May and June and October \u2026\u201d This creates a vivid echo with the flatter emphases of the previous stanza, where, owning up to the educated tendency to call a spade a spade, Thomas makes bold use of repetition: unlike the thrush, perhaps, humans call \u201cNovember November, / And April April, / And Winter Winter\u201d. Thomas makes no Romantic assumptions in his poetry. Here, he treats the themes which another poet might sentimentalise, in a characteristically quizzical way, nudging himself gradually towards optimism with: \u201cI must remember / What died into April / And consider what will be born / Of a fair November.\u201d It\u2019s interesting that he qualifies November with \u201cfair\u201d \u2013 and perhaps he means something more than seasonal clemency by the adjective. November is fair in the sense that dying and death are fair, if necessities of rebirth and regrowth are to occur. Finally, poet and thrush find the amplitude in which to sing \u2013 and therefore, the space and tranquility to \u201clove and forget in\u201d. The poem avoids anthropomorphism: it finds, instead, the song-thrush in the man, and the thrush\u2019s lore accessible to him despite his better knowledge, his closer reading. The song-thrush has a varied and rather etiolated though liquidescent call: listening to it is like following a small stream descending unevenly over pebbles and making twists and turns echoed in sound. There\u2019s another poem where Thomas talks about the \u201cpure thrush word\u201d \u2013 suggesting he likes, and even marvels at, the prosaic as well as the lyrical aspects of its voice. This poem, though, is pure word music: its sounds always emphasise the song. \u2022 Smart Devices: 52 Poems from the Guardian Poem of the Week, edited by Carol Rumens, is published by Carcanet.
