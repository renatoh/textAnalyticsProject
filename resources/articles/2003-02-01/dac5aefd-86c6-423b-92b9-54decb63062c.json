They probably thought it couldn't get any worse than losing to Canada in their opening match, then along came Chaminda Vaas to take a hat-trick with the first three balls they faced against Sri Lanka. The ICC, the game's governing body, should now take a long look at the situation and accept that they might have made a mistake by rushing Bangladesh to the top table. I can sympathise with the desire to expand the game around the world - and no-one is suggesting the smaller teams shouldn't be at the World Cup - but we need to retain the integrity of Test cricket, and at the moment Bangladesh are not up to the task. They are a very young side showing all the signs of a team who have been asked to run before they can walk, and it would be doing them a favour to suspend their Test programme while the ICC start investing heavily in a programme to bring out the potential that is plainly there. Let's give them a breather, a couple of years to regroup and get themselves in some sort of order. The ICC should have learnt by now that you can't just give a country Test status and expect them to be capable of playing Test cricket. It takes time. It takes good players. It takes a good structure at home and experience of playing overseas. Bangladesh are due to play two Tests in Australia later this year - to what purpose? Even the most diehard Aussie fan will struggle to gain any pleasure from watching such a one-sided affair. It will be like putting Audley Harrison in the ring with Lennox Lewis; there simply isn't the experience there yet to make it in to anything approaching a contest. You don't learn as a boxer by fighting vastly superior opponents - you just get knocked out all the time. When Sri Lanka were admitted to Test cricket in the 1980s they had a nucleus of top-quality players in Mendis, de Silva and a couple of decent bowlers. There are no similar stars in the Bangladeshi team, and you would have to say that Kenya, with Steve Tikolo, Maurice Odumbe and Martin Suji, might have made more of the five-day game in recent years. You would certainly fancy Kenya to win when they meet in this World Cup. I'm convinced that Bangladesh will one day become a strong Test nation because they have good facilities, a large base of players and a cricket-crazy population. But the present situation is doing them no favours at all. If you think it's tough being an England fan at times, just imagine what it's like to follow a team who are annihilated in every Test they play. When I visited the country as manager of an England A team a few years ago, I was taken aback by the knowledge of the fans and their love of the game. It was very much like touring India, with everyone wanting to shake your hand and talk about cricket. Two stadiums we played in were top-class in terms of facilities, and they had just set up an academy in university grounds outside Dacca. But at that time they weren't playing any four-day domestic matches, and I had serious doubts about their ability to adapt from limited overs to five-day Tests. What I'd like to see is the ICC organising matches for Bangladesh against opponents they have a chance of beating, particularly four-day games. There has been talk of setting up a cradle competition, a sort of second-tier Test competition involving the likes of Kenya, Holland, Namibia and Canada - maybe Scotland, Ireland and Denmark, too. If that proves too expensive there are simpler ways of gaining experience. The England A side learned a lot playing in the West Indies domestic championship back in 2001 and something similar would bring on talented players such as the 18-year-old Mohammad Ashraful. This summer Scotland will be playing in our National League. Great idea. In three years time they will have played 54 matches against county opposition. It is also important that potential Test players get more experience overseas, where the ball nips around more off the seam. Again, this would be neither difficult to arrange nor expensive, especially given support from the Bangladeshi community in this country. A summer playing for a club in the Lancashire league is going to be far more productive in the long term than facing Brett Lee in Darwin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
