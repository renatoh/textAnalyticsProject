In a bid to reduce waiting times to 50 days, the new NDIS minister, Stuart Robert, announced on Wednesday the government would offer interim plans for children aged six and under who were expected to face long delays to get onto the scheme. The average waiting time for an NDIS plan to be finalised is more than 100 days, but Robert pledged the new policy would give those expected to wait longer than 50 days a $10,000 \u201cstandardised interim plan\u201d while their full package was being worked out. \u201cI have been working with the NDIA to identify what more can be done to reduce the backlogs that are currently being experienced by families in some locations,\u201d he said. The scheme \u2013 which now covers 280,000 participants, including 11,500 aged 0-6 who access the NDIS Early Childhood Early Intervention program \u2013 has been plagued by delays. Some parents have complained about waiting nearly 12 months for access to a finalised plan, while MPs have said their offices have received reports of parents waiting more than six months for their first planning meeting. Romola Hollywood, the director of policy and advocacy at People with Disability Australia, said the organisation was pleased the government had taken \u201cthe first steps\u201d in addressing \u201cconsiderable delays for people with disability in accessing supports through the NDIS\u201d. But she warned that Wednesday\u2019s announcement should only be seen as a temporary fix. \u201cIn addition, the introduction of standard interim plans while individual plans are being implemented must be seen as only a stopgap measure, and not as a move away from the individualised supports that people with disability need,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe also need to see measures to reduce delays, such as removing the staff cap at the NDIA, and better training for staff, introduced as soon as possible.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Council for Intellectual Disability chief executive, Justine O\u2019Neill, also said the changes would \u201cgo some way to reduce the delays\u201d but were a \u201cstop-gap measure and not a solution\u201d. \u201cIt is encouraging that this announcement provides a better pathway for children with complex support needs with these children being immediately streamed to an NDIA Early Childhood specialist to develop their NDIS plan,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. Piers Gooding, an NDIS researcher at the University of Melbourne, said the changes were \u201ca good thing\u201d but would only help a small number of overall participants despite delays across the entire scheme. A spokesman for Robert said the changes announced on Wednesday would be funded through existing NDIS operational funding. The scheme recorded a $1.6bn underspend in the federal budget, which proved to be a major point of contention at the May election. The government said the changes would give children who don\u2019t currently receive state disability funding a \u201cstandard plan\u201d. It would be replaced by their full package within six months (around 180 days). Those who are currently receiving support from the states or territories would also get the $10,000 package, even if their existing plan was worth less than that. The NDIA told Senate estimates last year children aged six and under were waiting an average of 107 days to to have their plans approved. It said in its most recent quarterly report the delays were down to \u201crapidity of the roll-out in some jurisdictions\u201d, where large numbers of files may be transferred on a single day\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
