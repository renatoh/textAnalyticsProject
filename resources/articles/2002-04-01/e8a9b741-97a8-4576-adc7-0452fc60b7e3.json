Put in to bat on a pitch with such a mottled complexion it should have been rushed into intensive care at the nearby Royal Free Hospital, they were bowled out for that score in just 38 overs. As the holders of the Benson and Hedges Cup this represented a less than impressive start to the defence of their title. They were caught cold and are now under pressure to perform against Hampshire at The Oval on Wednesday. Middlesex knocked off the runs with almost 20 overs to spare and for the loss of just two wickets, led by an unbeaten 50 from Owais Shah. Of the eleven completed Benson and Hedges Cup ties between these two counties Middlesex have now won eight. In this rain-interrupted match they were more likely to be thwarted by Duckworth/Lewis than Tudor/Bicknell. But despite three breaks for the weather no overs were deducted because the Surrey innings had taken up so little time. This was a heartening victory for a young Middlesex side entering a fresh, post Gus Fraser epoch against one of the outstanding sides in the land. As for Surrey, it would be cruel to read too much into the result, especially given the magnificent start they have made to the season. Mark Butcher, alone among their specialist batsmen, reached double figures on a surface where the ball swung and seamed generously. Credit, though, should go to the Middlesex bowlers Chad Keegan and Ashley Noffke who exploited the conditions superbly and shared seven wickets. Alec Stewart, already with a brace of championship nineties, looked disconcerted and was soon caught behind, driving with little foot movement. Mark Ramprakash should have been out lbw to the next ball of Keegan's over but failed to cash in on his reprieve. He was caught at second slip by Paul Weekes for an uncertain four. Nadeem Shahid was caught behind as he pushed forward with some diffidence to a delivery from Fraser that straightened up the hill; leaving his side on 42 for three in the 13th over. Surrey lost their fourth wicket in the next over when Alistair Brown was caught at second slip from an indecisive push-drive against Keegan. And Ian Ward was fifth out at 51, run out by Sven Koenig's direct throw after being rightly sent back by Butcher. Poor Butcher. The acting Surrey captain, who at least picked up the Gold Award, was playing Middlesex on his own. He reached his fifty from 70 deliveries, with seven fours, and seemed bewildered by the failings of his fellows. Azhar Mahmood went lbw to the Australian Noffke - like himself a stand-in overseas player - who bowled one that nipped back sharply. Then Alex Tudor was run out by Andy Strauss at cover. Butcher was eighth out when he was bowled by a Noffke delivery that moved in sharply and the innings closed shortly afterwards. Middlesex were never under any pressure, though Koenig was dropped at third slip by Azhar off Tudor when he had scored only three. Azhar made partial amends when he caught Strauss in the gully off Jim Ormond, but by then Middlesex had 37 on the board and were well launched. Koenig was run out by Martin Bicknell's throw from mid-off five runs later. But Shah and Ben Hutton made light of the conditions. No Matthau. No thriller. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
