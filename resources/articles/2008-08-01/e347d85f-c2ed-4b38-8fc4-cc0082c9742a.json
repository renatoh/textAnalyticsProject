By night she joins her boyfriend clambering over the rooftops of Bath. \"Buildering\", they call it. One evening, looking down from the Royal Crescent, they spot a woman asleep on a bench, a half-finished sketch in her lap. On a whim, Joss decides to complete it. Wendy, the woman on the bench, is a retired art teacher. She's fled to Bath after finding a lump in her stomach. She should be seeing a specialist; instead she's gawping at buildings. When Wendy wakes up, does she a) blow her nose into Joss's sketch after declaring it the biggest load of rubbish she's ever seen, or b) decide it's \"a masterpiece\" and vow to get her new friend into architecture school if it's the last thing she does? Find out in Daniel Jamieson's play Building Happiness (2.15pm, Radio 4). Or you could join Stephen Fry on his journey through the English language. Today's Fry's English Delight (9am, Radio 4) is looking at metaphors. Cue maritime historians squabbling over the original meanings of \"balls\" and \"brass monkey\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
