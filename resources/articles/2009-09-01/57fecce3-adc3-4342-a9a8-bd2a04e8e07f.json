Nothing could prepare even the most experienced horse watcher for the splendour of Sea The Stars as he steps from his box: calm, strong and maybe bound for immortality. John Oxx, his trainer, might justifiably have objected to the thought of disturbing his \"horse of a lifetime\" for a spell with our photographer. But Oxx knows what he has on the end of that lead. With feline gait and still-gleaming coat, Sea The Stars ambles through the yard, passing good but lesser creatures, to allow the lens to record his majesty. Here, as all of racing knows, is the distillation of everything breeders and owners and trainers have searched for over centuries. This has been a stellar season for this three-year-old colt of aristocratic breeding. Owned by Christopher Tsui, a wealthy 27-year-old Hong Kong nightclub proprietor, the horse will break even higher ground if he wins either the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris on 4 October or the Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita in California on 7 November. Or both \u2013 though Oxx advises punters not to book both trips just yet. \"I'd say that if he had to miss the Arc because of the weather [Sea The Stars is averse to soft ground] then we'd have to be giving the Breeders' Cup serious thought. His owners have the view that it's either/or \u2013 that we can't be asking him for too much. We'll have to see how the Arc goes, how he comes out of it. Santa Anita is there as an option, but we have to thrash it out.\" Alongside this pageant of equine brilliance an academic debate is hotting up. The respected Timeform organisation now rate Oxx's horse the equal of Dancing Brave, Shergar and Dubai Millennium on a ranking of 140. An emphatic victory in France or America could yet push Sea The Stars past Mill Reef (141) and Brigadier Gerard (144), those stars of the early 70s, to become the most exalted Flat racer of the post-war age. \"It's marvellous just that he's up there with them. I wouldn't get into any debate about who's the best horse. Nobody can answer that,\" Oxx says. \"His next race will have a bearing on the final figure. He merits the rating he's getting, that's for sure. Not only has he been winning but he's been winning easily. \"Brigadier Gerard and Mill Reef also won over a variety of distances, you know. They were marvellous horses. Sea Bird was the flashiest Arc winner in my time. Mill Reef was such a generous sort of horse. He could stretch clear and win by large margins. He didn't seem to mind flying away from them. Brigadier Gerard ran a lot of races, he was outstanding. Nijinsky was a Triple Crown winner [2,000 Guineas, Derby, St Leger]. They are the ones.\" By now, most horses capable of winning the 2,000 Guineas in the first days of May are clinging to power. Vitality is on the wane, winter's coat is sprouting, the body is calling out for rest. But if Sea The Stars is on the slide, he earns an Oscar for his mastery of concealment. Two weeks ago, in his first run in Ireland since his two-year-old days, he answered those who thought his previous victory at York in the Juddmonte International Stakes a shade laboured by demolishing the Irish Derby winner, Fame And Glory, in the Irish Champion Stakes. To recap: Sea The Stars has won five Group 1 races this season from a mile to a mile and a half. Those include two Classics \u2013 the 2,000 Guineas and the Derby \u2013 as well as the prestigious Eclipse Stakes at Sandown, plus the 10-furlong championship events at York and Leopardstown. His only defeat in eight races was on his debut, at The Curragh, in July last year, when he finished fourth. His sire, Cape Cross, is Europe's leading stallion and his dam, Urban Sea, won the Arc, so there is a family tradition to live up to. In the sitting room of a house that looks across the Curragh plain to the racecourse where Nijinsky established his credentials as the last Triple Crown winner, Oxx smiles as he recalls the York race and the subsequent accusation that Sea The Stars had been laboured in his one-length defeat of Mastercraftsman. \"York would mislead the inexperienced race watcher, really,\" he says. \"They wouldn't understand this thing of quickening up once and then taking a pull, relaxing just at the moment the other horse is asked to quicken. What he did there \u2013 very few horses would do that. He flashed through the gap and was right on the heels of Mastercraftsman. Mick [Kinane, his rider] just wanted to pull him off the heels of Mastercraftsman and didn't want to take him on that soon. As he said himself, it made it look harder than it should have been.\" With doubt buried, Oxx returns to the \"miracle\" of finding a beast so good, and the intellectual challenge of stretching his form from bright May to muddy October. \"With most horses, you wouldn't attempt what we're attempting with this fellah. Most horses couldn't do it,\" he says. \"But also there are a lot of horses you wouldn't be so brave with. \"He's got a great pedigree \u2013 that's the first thing. He's bred to be a champion. He's a big strong horse, good looking, very attractive, great size, strength, length, great economical action. He's a great stride to him, but it's a very economical one, too. He has a great constitution, he seems to be able to shake off ailments and doesn't get them much to begin with. He had a temperature on 17 March and was able to recover in time to win the Guineas, which was quite remarkable. Very few horses would be able to do that. That was a big pointer to his general constitution \u2013 his ability not to miss training days. \"Then there's his temperament. He doesn't worry about anything. He has this tremendous appetite. He gets fed four times a day at six-hourly intervals. And he demolishes every feed. That's a terrific thing in a horse. You get a small number will eat like he does. Whether he's done a hard day's work or not he's the same. Those horses have this toughness, this temperament that sets them apart from the rest. \"He needs work. He needs to keep on the move, to keep settled and quiet in himself. He's a big strong athlete who likes to canter and likes to work. So you wouldn't give him a holiday anyway. You'd find it hard to give him a holiday. You'd find it hard to just trot him for three weeks. He'd be on springs.\" Oxx, who also trained the champions Sinndar and Ridgewood Pearl, remembers an early sense of revelation: \"We always liked him. We always thought he might be a special horse. We didn't really stoke him up as a two-year-old. He just came along and did what was required. It was always going to be about this year. His work in the springtime when we were a bit hampered by wet weather was encouraging. We got the chance to do some work on good ground and he flew up. Mick felt he had the speed for the Guineas and could be the special one.\" The trainer agrees that these days Flat racers are a harder sell outside the Turf's esoteric realm. \"It's getting harder. At the time of Nijinsky and all those horses, racing had a higher profile, didn't it? It was a bigger sport nationally than it is today. Newspapers are taken over by football and all sorts of things. Racing is struggling to keep its share. I think Sea The Stars is getting there, all right. People who don't have a racing interest have said to me they know about Sea The Stars.\" To the rural Irish, where the veneration of great horses was always an alternative religion, Sea The Stars is a community treasure. \"There was a lot of disappointment he didn't run in the Irish Derby, as people were looking forward to seeing him, but there's a bit of excitement around The Curragh,\" Oxx says, not wanting to overstate it. \"The lads from other strings \u2013 they know him, by this stage. You see them talking to one another as he goes by. So there's a feeling that there's something special around. And there's a feeling he'll only be around for this year. The reception he got at Leopardstown \u2013 the enthusiasm for him \u2013 showed that people do appreciate him.\" \"Only around for this year\" is the language of stud fees. The Classic generation tend to retire at the end of their three-year-old campaigns to protect their stallion valuation. But Sea The Stars is a veteran compared to the fly-by-night lotharios who used to be carted off to the covering sheds in mid-summer. No one could reasonably disparage a programme that will have featured outings in every month from May to October and against all-comers. But could he still be with us next year? Oxx says: \"I can't see it. Owners always ask the same thing. A horse like that \u2013 what more can we do, what more could he prove, how could he elevate his reputation? And you say, well he could do this, that and the other, but it probably wouldn't elevate him any higher than he is now. He's not going to go to a Timeform rating of 150, you know?\" The Timeform game is good for the pub. It relies on mathematical criteria that always collide with emotional allegiance. For trainers, the music of chance plays in all their searches for the horse that will make sense of the early mornings, the stress, the letdowns. \"My father was a great dreamer. I would have always hoped as a youngster to have really good horses. That means more to a trainer \u2013 to have a star horse, rather than a load of winners,\" Oxx says. \"It certainly means more to me. I was always reading about racing and great horses of the past. So when you grow up with the history of racing and the history of breeding, the landmark horses that come along over a century, and more \u2013 to train one that's in that league gives you the greatest satisfaction. \"It's what you've worked for all your life and not something you can expect to get. It's a miracle really. You can work and work away, but these horses have to walk through your gate, don't they? You don't make them. It's just by chance they come along, and when they do you want to do them justice.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
