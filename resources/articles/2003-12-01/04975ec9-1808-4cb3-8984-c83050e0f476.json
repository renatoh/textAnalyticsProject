If the club can stay out of administration, Leeds will then order a warts-and-all inquest into how they have accumulated debts of \u00a380m, losing \u00a3952,000 a week in the last financial year. The proposal was put forward at a stormy and vitriolic AGM yesterday, notable for the hostility shown towards the former vice-chairman Allan Leighton, with the club's board giving provisional backing to a review of the excesses of the past five years. It would mean, for instance, that the former chairman Peter Ridsdale will be invited to explain his extravagant tenure and why, in the words of one shareholder, Leeds were now \"the laughing stock of the football world, the financial market and the business community\". Ridsdale and Leighton probably chose well to stay away from two hours of mudslinging and raised tempers at Elland Road, where more than 200 shareholders turned up to ensure Professor John McKenzie remembers his final day as chairman for all the wrong reasons. He and his fellow directors were accused of \"telling a pack of lies\" and being \"handsomely rewarded for abject failure\" as well as being \"inept, incompetent, bungling and ham-fisted\". The mood was not eased when the finance director Neil Robson admitted that, as part of the bizarre deal that means Leeds still pay half of Robbie Fowler's wages at Manchester City, he will receive \u00a33.78m from them by June 2006. One shareholder asked whether that would continue even if Fowler was \"transferred to Port Vale\". Robson replied: \"Yes.\" Most of the vitriol was reserved for Leighton, who resigned from the board last month to avoid a potential conflict of interest while he heads one of the consortiums hoping to buy the club. They have a January 19 deadline to do so otherwise administration is a near certainty, but one shareholder earned applause when he said Leighton should \"have resigned months ago along with all the other failures\". It was notable, too, that the club's new chief executive Trevor Birch appeared to sympathise with that particular grievance. \"I know what you're saying,\" he said. At the same time, Birch defended McKenzie: \"John took control of the ship at a difficult and traumatic time and steered it through some turbulent waters. The reality is the ship is still afloat when it may well have sunk if John hadn't implemented some very difficult decisions.\" Birch will replace McKenzie as acting chairman while the takeover talks continue. Xu Ming, the Chinese millionaire businessman, can be discounted, but Birch seemed cautiously optimistic of success in a \"very, very delicate set of negotiations\". He added: \"The next five weeks is the most critical period in Leeds's history. If we go into administration, we will be the first Premiership club to do so and nobody knows what will happen.\" As for an independent inquiry, Birch said: \"It sounds a sensible thing.\" He continued: \"Shareholders have a right to be angry. It's difficult to defend because the [financial] results speak for themselves.\" The outcry continued even when Birch insisted players such as Mark Viduka and Alan Smith would not be sold in next month's transfer window and subsided only when Eddie Gray, the caretaker manager, took to the stage and was given a standing ovation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
