The 29-year-old man is not one of the three men thrown out of the IRA for the killing but detectives believe he was in a Belfast bar with the gang on the same night they battered and stabbed Mr McCartney to death. He volunteered to meet officers at Musgrave Street police station in Belfast as the government demanded more action by the IRA to turn in the murderers. Sisters of the dead man, from the Short Strand district of the city, claim witnesses to Mr McCartney's killing have been been intimidated by republicans. The family claim at least nine others implicated in the killing are being sheltered by the organisation. With Gerry Adams and the Sinn F\u00e9in leadership facing a major political crisis over the murder, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Paul Murphy, today said the decision by the IRA to expel the three men allegedly involved was not enough. \"The important thing is that we actually catch the murderers and also that witnesses in the Short Strand and elsewhere who might know something about this come to police,\" he said. The murder has threatened to inflict serious damage on a republican movement still reeling from the multi-million pound Northern Bank robbery blamed on the IRA and allegations of a massive money laundering racket. Mr Murphy praised 33-year-old Mr McCartney's sisters for staging street rallies to appeal for witnesses to come forward. Even though some of the customers of Magennis's Bar on the night of the murder have come forward, police have still to get anyone willing to testify and supply vital evidence. Hugh Orde, the Northern Ireland chief constable, also took a swipe at the IRA's action, saying: \"I'm not that impressed by illegal organisations ejecting people who have committed illegal acts. \"This was not committed just by three people. We are looking to gather evidence against anyone that was involved in the actual offence, or in a conspiracy to commit the offence or in the affray around the offence.\" As the pressure surrounding republicans showed no sign of easing, the Sinn F\u00e9in chief negotiator, Martin McGuinness, insisted he wanted to see the murderers brought to court but stopped short of saying witnesses should speak to the police. \"Paul Murphy is aware of the huge difficulties that the nationalist and republican constituency has with the PSNI [Police Service of Northern Ireland. \"Some people are saying 'Why doesn't Sinn F\u00e9in hand these people over?' Do they want Sinn F\u00e9in to go out and abduct people and then Sinn F\u00e9in is in even more trouble? Do they want the IRA to abduct people and then the IRA is in more trouble?\" One of Mr McCartney's sisters today claimed at a council debate that one of the gang members was still walking the streets. \"One of them was in St Matthew's social club the night before last,\" said Paula McCartney. \"Those involved are going about their daily lives, being seen in the community. It's sickening. Our lives are ripped apart and we are the victims.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
