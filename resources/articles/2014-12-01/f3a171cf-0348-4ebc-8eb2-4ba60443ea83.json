Now the group \u2013 Water and Sanitation Health, or Wash \u2013 has filed an additional lawsuit against the Rainforest Alliance, claiming that the environmental organization is also responsible for unfair marketing because it certified Chiquita farms as sustainable. In a statement, the Rainforest Alliance called Wash\u2019s allegations untrue and said it stands by its auditing practices. The environmental group also objected to the lawsuit\u2019s charges that the alliance sells its endorsement. Businesses that receive certifications must meet rigorous sustainability standards, the statement said. Wash sued the Chiquita at the end of last year, saying that the North Carolina-based fruit distributor\u2019s partner farms in southern Guatemala have contaminated drinking water with fertilizers and fungicides \u2013 and have air-dropped pesticides perilously close to schools and homes. Wash unknowingly and unintentionally helped fund \u201csignificant environmental harm to ecosystems\u201d when it bought Chiquita bananas, the now-settled suit alleges. The new suit, filed Wednesday, claims the Rainforest Alliance is also complicit because the group certified Chiquita farms and advertised its collaboration with the fruit company. Chiquita\u2019s website claims the company makes sparing use of agrochemicals and protection of local communities. The company stands by its sustainability record, said spokesman Ed Loyd, adding that Chiquita first started working with environmental groups 20 years ago, long before such measures were common in the industry. The Wash lawsuit \u201cis particularly unfortunate considering Chiquita has had a very extensive and long record of collaboration with a lot of different organizations,\u201d Loyd said. \u201cChiquita believes in the strength of its [corporate social responsibility] programs and we will defend against any lawsuits that may be filed.\u201d The Chiquita settlement prevents Wash from pursuing further legal action against the company, but yet more lawsuits \u2013 from other parties \u2013 are already in the works and should be filed within weeks, said Eric John Harrison, an attorney and the executive director of Wash. \u201cI am not precluded from representing other people who purchased Chiquita bananas, believing they were grown in an environmentally conscious and responsible manner,\u201d Harrison said. \u2018Less tolerance for greenwashing\u2019 The allegations raised in these lawsuits come at a moment when it is growing more difficult for companies to get away with making false environmental claims, a practice known as \u201cgreenwashing.\u201d Consumers have grown more discerning when faced with marketing that promotes a product as environmentally friendly, and legal authorities are more likely to take action against false claims, said Richard J Sobelsohn, an attorney who works for LexisNexis in New York City and has taught and written about sustainability law. \u201cThere\u2019s no question about it \u2013 there\u2019s less tolerance for greenwashing,\u201d Sobelsohn said. In the past few years, the Federal Trade Commission has cracked down on deceptive environmental marketing practices. This year alone, the agency has settled with three plastic lumber makers, a diaper company, and a plastics manufacturer over charges that the businesses exaggerated the environmental benefits of their products. Meanwhile, several high-profile lawsuits have also cropped up over the use of promotional terms that aren\u2019t legally defined. General Mills was sued by consumers who claim the term \u201cnatural\u201d should not be used on products containing genetically modified ingredients, for example, and chicken giant Perdue Farms agreed to drop the phrase \u201chumanely raised\u201d from some of its labeling. Rainforest Alliance audited certified farms Chiquita has long bolstered its green credentials through its collaboration with the Rainforest Alliance. The banana company, which promotes \u201cLoving Our Planet\u201d as one of the pillars of its operation, has been working with the Rainforest Alliance since the early 1990s. \u201cIn the early 90s, it was actually something that was very forward-leaning for our industry. To embrace that there would be third-party auditors that would come on to our own farms,\u201d Loyd said. All of the banana farms owned by Chiquita and all third-party growers with which the company has long-term contracts are certified by the Rainforest Alliance, Loyd said, adding that roughly 75% of the bananas sold under the Chiquita name are grown on these certified farms. The latest lawsuit, however, alleges Rainforest Alliance staff told Harrison that as little as 15% of Chiquita bananas are grown under sustainable conditions. In June, the Rainforest Alliance conducted an audit of five farms in the area mentioned in the lawsuit, according to a prior statement provided by the organization. The audits found the farms to be in compliance, and the operations retain their certifications. Pesticides and pollution Harrison, however, said his visits to these growing operations in October 2013 and May 2014 paint a different picture. He found chemical residues on the communities\u2019 schools and playgrounds, he claimed in the lawsuit, and talked to community members who reported rashes and vomiting when the bananas were fumigated. He also took water samples from local rivers and wells, and had them tested for pollutants, according to the claim. The results, the lawsuit alleges, show nitrate as much as 10 times the levels considered safe for infants by the World Health Organization. \u201cMy concern is the level of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides that go into producing the bananas \u2026 is causing the ground water and the rivers in this area to be polluted,\u201d Harrison said. After Harrison\u2019s claims came to the Rainforest Alliance\u2019s attention, the group \u201cupdated our website material regarding Chiquita to ensure it was up to date\u201d, said RA spokeswoman Donita Dooley. Harrison says the website previously exaggerated Chiquita\u2019s sustainability. Chiquita is not the first banana enterprise Harrison has taken on. In 2011, Wash filed a similar suit against Dole. In that case, the company agreed to take measures to improve the quality of water in the areas Harrison identified. He had been hoping for a similar response from Chiquita, he said, adding that he believes producers should provide water filters for affected communities. \u201cIt was my hope that Chiquita would do the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have chosen not to take that path.\u201d Sarah Shemkus is a freelance reporter and editor who writes about business, technology, food and the places where they all meet.
