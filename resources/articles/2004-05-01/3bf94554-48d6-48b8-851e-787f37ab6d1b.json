The winner of the Arsenal - Fulham match will have won the league; if they draw, it will belong to Charlton. After weeks of negotiation, a time and place have been agreed. When the crowds finally filter out of Highbury on Saturday after seeing their team presented with the Premiership trophy, they will be invited to re-enter it free of charge for a match kicking off at 7pm. Arsenal have fought back after last season's trophyless campaign. \"I found that hard to take,\" said Faye White, the club captain. \"But once you experience defeat you remember what winning was like. Sometimes you need that disappointment.\" Saturday's match represents the completion of a revival for White, too. It was against Fulham in November 2002 that she limped off with a cruciate injury that would keep her out of the game for nine months and leave her career as a personal trainer in ruins. Then Arsenal stepped in and now her uniform is her Gunners tracksuit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
