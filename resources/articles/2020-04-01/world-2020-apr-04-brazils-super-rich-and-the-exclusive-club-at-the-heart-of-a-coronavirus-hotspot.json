But the Rio de Janeiro Country Club \u2013 founded by British executives in 1916 and frequented since by the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of carioca society \u2013 has been thrown into mourning by the coronavirus pandemic, sparking a nationwide debate about class and inequality in one of the most economically lopsided societies on earth. At least 60 of the club\u2019s 850 globe-trotting members have reportedly been struck down with Covid-19, while one \u2013 the septuagenarian businesswoman Mirna Bandeira de Mello \u2013 has died and been laid to rest during a funeral attended by no one but her son. \u201cIn normal times there would have been millions at her burial,\u201d Christiano Bandeira de Mello lamented in an interview with the Brazilian magazine \u00c9poca. Anna Maria Ramalho, a society columnist who had known the victim since school, said she had been forced to say goodbye by logging on to an online mass. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a life-long friend,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was such a special person, so very down-to-earth.\u201d Coronavirus appears to have breached the country club\u2019s white wooden gates \u2013 just metres from Ipanema beach \u2013 on the afternoon of 7 March \u2013 although exactly how is now a topic of bitter dispute. Hours earlier, descendants of Brazil\u2019s former royal family had gathered at a nearby mansion to toast the engagement of 31-year-old Pedro Alberto de Orl\u00e9ans e Bragan\u00e7a \u2013 the great-great-great grandson of Brazil\u2019s last emperor, Pedro II \u2013 and his 26-year-old partner, Alessandra Fragoso Pires. Guests included Pires\u2019 mother and stepfather, who had jetted in from their home in London, and others from Belgium, Italy and the United States. More than half of the 70-or-so people at the lunch have since tested positive for Covid-19 including the bride\u2019s father and grandfather and the groom\u2019s aunt. Three remain in hospital, in serious condition. \u201cIt\u2019s just horrible,\u201d said one family member who attended the celebration and asked not to be named. \u201cNobody could have imagined the virus would strike with such devastating force.\u201d After lunch, several guests spent the afternoon at the \u201ccountry\u201d \u2013 sparking speculation they had caused its coronavirus cluster \u2013 something strenuously denied by one friend of Brazil\u2019s former monarchy. \u201cOne thing has nothing to do with the other,\u201d they insisted. \u201cNobody knows what happened \u2013 who brought it [the virus] and who didn\u2019t. They were surprised by this.\u201d Whatever the truth, two days later on 9 March, coronavirus continued to contaminate the club\u2019s illustrious membership. At a packed assembly \u2013 reportedly convened to thrash out a dispute between its old guard and a new generation of associates who lack the traditional surnames of past members, but not their deep pockets \u2013 cross words, and then kisses and hugs were exchanged. \u201cLots of people lost their fortunes in the financial crisis \u2013 people who were stinking rich and ended up with nothing \u2013 so they had to sell their membership,\u201d one prominent Rio socialite said of the generational tug-of-war at the club where members are chosen by secret ballot and it costs around \u00a370,000 to join. The 270-strong audience also included people who were at the imperial family\u2019s commemoration \u2013 further fueling suspicions they were to blame for the outbreak. \u201cIt was a tense meeting, big names in business were there,\u201d the high-society source said. \u201cSeveral people left the meeting infected.\u201d The country club is not the only oasis of Brazilian prosperity and influence touched by coronavirus. A pop star, an actress and the daughter of a top government official were infected during a celebrity wedding at a beach resort that boasts of being \u201cconceived with the philosophy of exclusiveness\u201d. Some affluent guests had reportedly flown in from holidays in Europe and Aspen, Colorado. Brazil\u2019s presidential palace has also been hit, with more than 20 members of a delegation that flew to meet Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate testing positive for Covid-19. The president, Jair Bolsonaro, claims he tested negative but has refused to make those results public. The connection between the spread of coronavirus and Brazil\u2019s super-rich has sparked discussion over their role in introducing the ailment to Brazil \u2013 and the gulf between rich and poor in one of the most unequal societies on earth. Many fear that while the first coronavirus wave has crashed over Brazil\u2019s largely white political and economic elite, it is the poor and mostly black masses who will eventually suffer the most \u2013 without the luxury of being able to self-isolate at home or resort to expensive private hospitals. One of the first deaths recorded in Brazil was that of Cleonice Gon\u00e7alves, a 63-year-old domestic helper who was reportedly infected by her wealthy employer when she returned from holiday in Italy. \u201cIt goes without saying that the most vulnerable will always be the most affected, irrespective of whether there is a pandemic or not,\u201d the black feminist intellectual Djamila Ribeiro wrote in the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper recently. \u201cThese are structural issues.\u201d Others, including some country club members, wonder whether some of Brazil\u2019s mega-moneyed coronavirus patients exposed others to the illness by failing to properly isolate or quarantine themselves \u2013 perhaps believing their economic status meant they were above such mundane measures. One Brazilian tycoon is reportedly being investigated by police for allegedly flying his private jet to the beach last month despite having tested positive for Covid-19. The man \u2013 an investment banker who denies the charges \u2013 is accused of infecting at least two locals in Trancoso, a glamorous seaside town in Bahia state. Rio de Janeiro \u2013 which has so far suffered 1074 coronavirus cases and 47 deaths \u2013 has been in lockdown since late March, forcing a succession of high-society soir\u00e9es to be scrapped. Among the aborted events was a bash for 1,000 people at the beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel to celebrate the marriage of Alexandre Birman, a multi-millionaire footwear designer who makes crocodile and snakeskin shoes for Hollywood stars. A confidant of the Orl\u00e9ans e Bragan\u00e7a family said they had more pressing concerns with two relatives still in intensive care. \u201cThey feel sad, apprehensive and worried \u2026 They are frightened with all this repercussion,\u201d they said. Some have pointed an accusing finger at Brazil\u2019s jet-setting elites for importing the illness after eye-wateringly expensive overseas adventures, with one left-wing website last week announcing: \u201cThe rich and famous have spread coronavirus around Brazil.\u201d Another blog declared: \u201cThe rich have contaminated Brazil.\u201d But a guest at the royal family\u2019s fateful lunch said it was wrong to scapegoat the wealthy for a sickness uninterested in social class. \u201cBoth poor and rich are dying all around the world,\u201d they said. \u201cPeople who travel more might have caught it first but the virus doesn\u2019t choose its victims. It can attack anyone.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
