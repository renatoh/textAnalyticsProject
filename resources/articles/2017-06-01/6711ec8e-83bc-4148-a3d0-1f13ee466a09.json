Drag Queen Story Hour riles the right, but delights kids", "bodyText": "It was the Drag Queen Story Hour at the San Francisco public library and six-year-old James Mendenhall intended to get right to the bottom of things. \u201cAre you a boy or a girl?\u201d he asked the 6ft 2in story reader, who was wearing a maroon satin gown, a hot pink frock, silver high-heeled pumps and false eyelashes. The drag queen, who goes by the name Honey Mahogany, leaned her delicately-braided blond wig towards him and paused for effect. \u201cWell, I guess I was born a boy,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut I like to dress like a girl. It\u2019s for fun.\u201d For the 175 or so children and parents who turned out for the event last weekend at San Francisco\u2019s main library, the program \u2013 which also runs regularly at libraries in New York City and sporadically in bookstores and classrooms around the country \u2013 offers a mix of gay pride and kid-friendly entertainment. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun for the kids to see a princess, dressed up and in makeup,\u201d said library spokeswomen Katherine Jardine, who added the program is a way for children to learn about the city\u2019s diversity. The story hours have come under fire recently by conservative publications for allegedly using public resources to indoctrinate children with leftist views. \u201cApparently, people around the country are interested in having their tax dollars spent paying for drag queens to read to their children,\u201d wrote education blogger Amelia Hamilton in the National Review last month. \u201cWhile this story time is ostensibly meant to introduce children to new ideas and open their minds, it is clear that the events skew in a particular political direction. What sort of outcry would there be if there were a children\u2019s event promoting American exceptionalism or traditional values? An event with books about gun rights or the value of life in the womb? No, that would never do.\u201d Attacks have turned up in places such as Breitbart News and as a discussion item in the ultra-religious Rapture Forum. The rightwing Daily Wire ran an article entitled \u201cLeftists push \u2018Drag Queen Story Hour\u2019 for public schools, libraries.\u201d But San Francisco\u2019s librarians emphasized that the program, founded in 2015 in San Francisco by writer Michelle Tea, does not use any taxpayer dollars. For each Drag Queen Story Hour, the nonprofit Friends of the Library group \u2013 a privately run organization \u2013 pays a $250 stipend to the production company that created the event, Radar Productions. Jardine said she believes much of that is passed onto the drag queens. Virgie Tolvar, managing director of Radar Productions, said that aside from the backlash in the conservative press, reception has been largely positive. \u201cWe get emails every day from places like Australia and Sweden. We\u2019re definitely thinking of doing a Drag Queen Story Hour tour.\u201d Lyn Davidson, who manages the main San Francisco children\u2019s library, said that the library \u201cis about giving everybody equal access to books, to stories, to ideas. It\u2019s about opening our doors so that every single member of our community is included. Our drag queen community has something special to share too\u201d. Honey Mahogany started on Saturday by reading Families, Families, Families, a book about how families can have a mom and a dad or just one mom or two dads. \u201cHow many of you recognize your own families in here right now?\u201d she asked, gesturing around the room with her shimmering silver bracelet glinting in the light. \u201cBecause families can come in all shapes, sizes and forms, right?\u201d After leading a rendition of Heads, Shoulders, Knees and Toes, Honey Mahogany settled in to read a second book, about a dog who didn\u2019t want to do normal dog stuff, but wanted to do ballet instead. Every once in a while a toddler would dart toward her, reaching out to touch her layers of puffy pink tulle and then run back into the audience. After the reading, a long line of children waited for a chance to talk to Honey Mahogany. Heather Bird not only brought her own two sons, but she organized other families from her children\u2019s school to come to the event as well. \u201cIt was a lot more interesting than anything going on at our house this morning,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why people have time to criticize people who are being kind to each other and coming together as a community.\u201d Fourteen-year-old CJ, a San Francisco middle school student who asked not to use his last name, came because he had seen Honey Mahogany on Rupaul\u2019s Drag Race, a TV show in which contestants in drag compete for who will be \u201cqueen\u201d. \u201cIt was great for me, because I got to meet someone I saw on TV,\u201d he said, adding that it is a great program for little kids as well. \u201cIt introduces kids to the idea that there could be more than two genders, so when they get older, maybe they won\u2019t be so mean. The world needs less trans-phobia right now.\u201d Honey Mahogany, who co-owns a business and also works as a social worker, said it was ridiculous to think that introducing children to gender issues would somehow turn them gay. But for those youth who do question their gender identities, having a role model could be a life-saver. \u201cI grew up with no LGBT role models and I still turned out gay,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cFamilies need to support and accept their children, because it is the difference between having a happy, healthy family and having kids who are much more likely to commit suicide.\u201d Panda Dulce is another drag queen who regularly reads for story hour, sometimes showing up in a bright teal wig wearing blue lipstick and swirling eye shadow. With a day job as a social worker, Dulce is attuned to the hardships of being different. \u201cWhen I came out in the seventh grade, I lost all of my friends,\u201d said Dulce, whose legal name is Kyle Casey Chu. \u201cI thought the closet was the loneliest place, but I was wrong. It was being out in the open, vulnerable and alone. Drag Queen Story Hour is so important to me, and for our youth, because it converts our differences from shame into power.\u201d Panda Dulce recalled one story time when a child in blue glitter eye shadow came running up to proclaim, \u201cDid you know I\u2019m a boy?\u201d Near the end of the greeting line on Saturday, six-year-old Mendenhall was waiting with another question brash enough to make even a drag queen blush. \u201cHow did you get your breasts?\u201d he asked Honey Mahogany. She gazed down at her modest bosom and decided to stick with the truth. \u201cI told him they were fake and I put them on under my bra,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat else was I going to say?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
