With no way of calculating their position, ships were running off course, and costing lives and trade. And so a prize of \u00a320,000 \u2013 several million in today's money \u2013 was offered for anyone who could find a way to measure longitude. The eventual winner was an outsider: rather than an astronomer, as had been expected, the prize was won by a clockmaker, John Harrison. Three hundred years on, Harrison's story of eccentricity and sheer doggedness is being told again as a new \u00a310m Longitude prize is launched. This time the challenge of our age will be voted on by the public. The choices are six global problems, including antibiotics resistance and food supply. But closer to home another great shipwreck looms. The NHS is battling through the longest funding squeeze in its history while demand from an ageing and increasingly obese population soars. Managers and doctors say they have cut costs where they can. But they and health thinktanks stress that funding has to rise if the NHS is to fend off a diabetes timebomb and meet the crushing cost of dementia care. Savings alone cannot cover soaring costs. Spending must recover. But at the same time, in its moment of crisis, the NHS has the opportunity to look for its own game-changing solutions. Necessity is the mother of invention, or \u2013 as NHS England medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh said recently \u2013 the current difficult times, if handled in the right way, could herald a new era of innovation and development. The good news is that the spirit of the Longitude prize can be found in NHS England, in the form of a body that poses problems to the private sector in the hope that inventors and small businesses will come back with new solutions. The other good news is that this Small Business Research Initiative for Healthcare (SBRI Healthcare) has seen its budget rise in recent years. It remains to be seen how quickly the new products it spawns will be adopted across the NHS, the world's biggest integrated healthcare system. History would suggest that any savings from innovations will take years to come through. But discoveries made so far offer some very real reasons to be cheerful. And they are not just about saving money; first and foremost they are about improving patients' lives. A favourite example used by SBRI Healthcare is a light-emitting mask being trialled for the treatment and prevention of blindness in diabetes patients. Developed with government support by County Durham startup PolyPhotonix, the masks could save the NHS \u00a31bn a year by replacing expensive clinic-based care with a home-based solution that works while patients sleep. For NHS managers, the breakthrough promises to be that holy grail of inventions: better and cheaper. Another innovation to come out of the SBRI's's health-related competitions is a nitric oxide dressing for diabetic foot ulcers, which often remain open and unhealed for months, and can lead to amputation. SBRI head Stephen Browning says the innovation, from Edinburgh-based EdixoMed, has the potential to address a huge challenge for the health service: \"There are 100 amputations a week in the NHS due to diabetic foot ulcers. That is catastrophic for individuals, and for the NHS it costs \u00a39,000 every time. Each [EdixoMed] dressing costs \u00a32 to \u00a33.\" In an ideal world, SBRI Healthcare and the wider SBRI, which sets other public sector challenges for industry, should in turn boost the private sector and the wider economy. Businesses which might otherwise struggle to get their ideas off the ground, win financial support and the kudos of working with a globally known health system. That opens up export markets, and may even allow the government to bring its promised economic rebalancing act a step closer. Yet for all the optimism around these life-changing inventions, NHS insiders and small businesses are less upbeat. Past estimates put the time lag between research expenditure and eventual health benefits at around 17 years. In a sprawling and diverse NHS this is a massive challenge, one which regional Academic Health Science Networks (AHSN) have been set up to tackle, by driving the adoption and dissemination of innovative healthcare. Their staff must be acutely aware that, on current budget projections, the NHS does not have anything like 17 years for the big money-saving changes to start paying back. But achieving big changes is as much about stopping doing the wrong things as adopting the better things. It seems the new NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens, recognises this as a key cultural battleground. He was talking about management last week when he put out a call for leaders to question the way they do things. But he might just as well have been talking about treatments and technology when he quoted the father of modern management, Peter Drucker: \"There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.\" The NHS is right to look for innovations that add value and not cost, but its many managers must be sure to make way for them. It took Harrison decades to persuade the Longitude board that he had solved its challenge. Let's hope the NHS is quicker to adopt the breakthroughs from today's Harrisons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
