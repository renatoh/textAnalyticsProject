Speaking at the White House on Tuesday, Trump confirmed he had called Putin to \u201ccongratulate him on his electoral victory\u201d, and said the two would \u201cprobably get together in the not too distant future so that we can discuss the arms race\u201d. But the two leaders did not discuss Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 US election or the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, the former double agent targeted with a nerve agent in the UK. The former US presidential candidate John McCain was quick to criticize Trump for his failure to raise allegations of widespread voter irregularities. \u201cAn American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections\u201d McCain said in a statement. \u201cAnd by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country\u2019s future, including the countless Russian patriots who have risked so much to protest and resist Putin\u2019s regime.\u201d The US president has consistently refused to criticise Putin, or acknowledge that Moscow might have played any part in putting him in the White House. But any meeting between the two leaders would be controversial, given the ongoing investigations into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 elections. The phone callcame just days after the United States imposed sanctions against 19 Russian nationals and five entities over Russian interference in the US elections. Those sanctioned included a wealthy businessman nicknamed \u201cPutin\u2019s chef\u201d and the Internet Research Agency, a producer of politically charged online content which has gained notoriety as a \u201ctroll factory\u201d. Western leaders had avoided offering direct congratulations to Putin, as is customary after an election win, to avoid legitimising Sunday\u2019s elections. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the elections, said they were well administered but had a \u201clack of genuine competition\u201d. German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and President Emmanuel Macron of France called Putin but both avoided explicitly using the word \u201ccongratulated\u201d. Instead both \u201cwished success\u201d to Putin. The White House struggled to explain the details of Trump\u2019s congratulatory call to Putin on Tuesday, which came amid escalating tensions over Russian meddling in US politics. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, repeatedly declined to say if the Trump administration believed the Russian election was free and fair. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on our elections. We don\u2019t get to dictate how other countries operate,\u201d Sanders told reporters. \u201cWhat we do know is that Putin has been elected in their country, and that\u2019s not something that we can dictate to them how they operate.\u201d She claimed that Russian interference in the US election \u201cdidn\u2019t come up\u201d during Trump\u2019s call with Putin. Sanders also said the poisoning in the UK \u201cwas not discussed\u201d. Of a potential meeting between Trump and Putin, Sanders said there were \u201cno specific plans made at this time\u201d, while adding: \u201cWe disagree with the fact that we shouldn\u2019t have conversations with Russia.\u201d Trump and Putin did not discuss the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, the former double agent, the Kremlin told the Interfax news agency on Tuesday.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said that the two leaders would probably discuss the \u201carms race, which is getting out of control. We will never allow anybody to have anything close to what we have.\u201d Talk of an \u201carms race\u201d has increased since Putin recently showed off Russia\u2019s newest nuclear weapons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
