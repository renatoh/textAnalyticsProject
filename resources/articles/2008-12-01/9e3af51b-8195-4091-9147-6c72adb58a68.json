Speaking in London, the world champion told BBC Sport: \"I don't think that [a standard engine] is ever going to happen ... simply because the manufacturers play such a huge role in the sport.\" Hamilton was spot-on. Plans for a standard-specification engine, supplied to strict FIA rules, will be unmasked tomorrow as no more than a successful negotiating ploy by the sport's governing body to force teams to cut costs for 2009 and beyond. The FIA world motor sport council, due to meet in the morning in Monaco, is instead expected to approve wide-ranging proposals that will see the current generation of 2.4-litre V8 engines extensively detuned. The manufacturers have also each agreed in principle to supply up to two independent teams from the start of the 2010 season at a fee not to exceed \u20ac5m (\u00a34.4m) per team. This is a clever compromise calculated to retain the interest of the big carmakers Renault, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Toyota only a week after Honda withdrew and put its team up for sale. In the meantime, for 2009 the existing engines will have their maximum engine speed cut back to 18,000rpm rather than the current limit of 19,000rpm. In addition they will have to last four races, rather than the present two, and most testing will be banned in the racing season. It is also expected that the FIA will supply to the teams' association details of the tendering process to which the engine specialist Cosworth submitted in order to be selected as the preferred standard engine supplier. The manufacturers think this will help them understand what specification they need to adopt for 2010 in order to balance power with durability and the need to keep within a tight budget."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
