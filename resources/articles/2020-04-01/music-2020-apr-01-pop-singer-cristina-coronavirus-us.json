The singer, whose full name was Cristina Monet-Zilkha, is believed to have died of complications from Covid-19, according to reports from various music channels and those close to the musician. Fans flooded the singer\u2019s Instagram account with comments, expressing their grief. Cristina is known for dance-pop tunes such as Things Fall Apart, Disco Clone and a cover of Peggy Lee\u2019s Is That All There Is? that were emblematic of the 1980s underground New York scene. She enjoyed brief success through club hits co-written with her husband, Ze Records label owner Michael Zilkha, before the two retired from music and moved to Texas in 1985. After her divorce in 1990, she returned to New York and wrote a number of music essays. In a Facebook post, Steve Wasserman, a UC Berkeley professor and friend of the late singer, said Cristina posted to social media that she was experiencing a high fever, but \u201cher lungs were clear\u201d and she appeared to be recovering. \u201cThen, with appalling swiftness, she was gone this morning,\u201d Wasserman wrote. Singer Zola Jesus paid tribute on Twitter, calling her a \u201cHUGE inspiration\u201d and praising her for being \u201ctoo weird for the pop world and too pop for the weird world\u201d. Notable names in music who have died from the virus include singer Alan Merrill, the songwriter behind I Love Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, and country musician Joe Diffie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
