Quietly audacious in form and timing, this strange and beautiful piece produced by Antler refuses to abide by the normal rules of storytelling. It makes mundanity electric. A young woman played by Sophie Steer returns from her partner\u2019s funeral and performs ordinary actions in the nonsensical way you do when no one\u2019s watching. Under Jaz Woodcock-Stewart\u2019s astute direction, nothing is of note and everything is noticed. The playful staging is constantly surprising, and there\u2019s a small thrill in watching Steer do things you can\u2019t fake on stage, such as frying eggs or playing a high-stakes game of Bop It. It\u2019s intoxicating to watch even as she mindlessly stares at her laptop while Dragon\u2019s Den plays to unlistening ears. Steer\u2019s character is oblivious to the three dancers \u2013 James Olivo, Emily Thompson-Smith and Alethia Antonia \u2013 who invade her space. They move wildly to music we hear only some of the time; the moments of silence are like held breath. Choreographer Morgann Runacre-Temple steals Steer\u2019s actions \u2013 the Marie Kondo method of folding, the jiggle of frying the eggs \u2013 and mutates them into complex, balletic movements. Threading through her home, the dancers echo today\u2019s constant distractions: the half-watched TV shows, the unreplied-to texts, the short attention spans, the ignored letters, the unhealthy investment in strangers\u2019 lives. Civilisation simultaneously evokes the feeling of loneliness and never being able to be truly alone. We don\u2019t fully understand the link between the two worlds, but the strange symbiosis of dramatic realism and contemporary dance creates an intimate, alien portrait of loss and isolation. I could watch for ever. \u2022 At Underbelly Cowgate, Edinburgh, until 25 August. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
