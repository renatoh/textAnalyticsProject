The Doors were now at the forefront of the Dionysiac wing of the hippy movement, with all the altered states, carnality, disorder and disregard for authority that entailed. One hot, late night in Miami, a worse-for-wear Morrison baited the crowd at a gig, disrobing. The incident has gone down in rock lore as the beginning of the end for Morrison, who died two years later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
