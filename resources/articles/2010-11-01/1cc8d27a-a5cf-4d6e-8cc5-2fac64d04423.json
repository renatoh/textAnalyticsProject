How excited are we all this chilly November evening? I'm on tenterhooks here, time-honoured pessimism giving way to a strange sense of pride that started taking hold midway through yesterday's afternoon session. I know we've all been here before with England but the way both openers and then Jonathan Trott went about their business yesterday made me feel this is a genuinely tough side. All that could go out of the window with a devastating burst from Australia this morning but reading the press Down Under it seems they're not holding out much hope for that. Mitchell Johnson has gone from enigma to being portrayed as a bit soft, more 90 pies an hour than 90mph. Gideon Haigh wrote in the Business Spectator: \"After one over, no fewer than seven team-mates ran past to ruffle his hair, pat his backside or maybe compliment him on his moustache. But he is wicketless so far here, and has taken three for 328 since his successful first innings in Mohali.\" On TMS the consensus is that England should get 300 ahead and then, regardless of whether a win is possible, try to inflict psychological damage on Australia by knocking a few of them over to undermine their confidence for Adelaide. Counting chickens, dangerous hubris or the sort of expectation that this England team deserves. I'm not sure, my brain's too frazzled by excitement. Early email department: Here's Alec Cochrane: \"Did you know that there were highlights on terrestrial television? I stumbled across them while channel surfing earlier. On ITV4. At 10 in the evening. What the hell? Why don't ITV tell you about these sorts of things. I know I don't watch it often because most of what they have is dross. It's the same as the English premier rugby highlights. Put it on a decent channel and at a decent time. End rant. PS - I had a two hour nap this afternoon so that I can make it through to at least lunch. That should give an indication of whether it's going to be a draw or whether we're going to set them a target. I'm feeling confident.\" I knew they were on but haven't seen them. Presumably they're using the C9 commentary so you'll get Bill Lawry, Tony Greig and the men who made Billy Birmingham rich. Are they showing the Gator Tracker? Marie Meyer \u2013 send me your thoughts and I'll get them up. Evening, too, to Gary Naylor: \"If the fire alarm goes off tonight, do evacuate the building. An 'expert' interviewed just now on Five Live has suggested calling in air strikes on Guardian servers!! Usually a couple of tech support guys running overnight back-ups are sufficient for the OBO to fall over.\" Sounds ominous Gary. More correspondence: John Starbuck writes:\"Given that both teams seem to have about the same number of missed chances - dropped catches, failed run-outs - what about the field settings? Are the bowlers bowling to their best fields? And are the best fielders in their best positions? If not, why not? You can understand captains wishing to rotate fielders a bit to give some people a rest, aka 'freshening up' which sounds like creeping management jargon, but how much do they maintain the optimum? Or is it just that the bowlers aren't up to it when the pitch doesn't wear out enough? Not that I'm complaining; England should stick it out at least from here. We can but hope.\" I think the plans, dread word, weren't adhered to yesterday but Ricky Ponting's 7-2 fields for the spinners seemed bizarre to me and catches go down when the legs and brains go. It must scramble the mind to be out there all day, expecting things to go your way and being bemused that it isn't. Daddy hundreds: Goochie is being interviewed by Nasser Hussain on Sky and he says he wants a \"daddy hundred\" from Alastair Cook. Is this a Keith Fletcher Essexism? It surely sounds like it. Gooch reckons in the best of worlds they'll bat for three hours and take it from there. Sounds like a plan. The target: \"One is tempted to point out that England only need 23 more for a 111 lead... Aussie implosion time? I do hope so...\" writes Toby Fenwick. Isn't it 87 for Australia, Toby? And what about the Twitter attack on Bumble. Really. Have a bit of respect for the man whose levity and astuteness has made England's renaissance such a joy to watch. Have you read his messages on Stephen Brenkley's Independent blog during the Bangladesh tour? Priceless. 102nd Over: England 310-1 (Cook 132, Trott 54) Siddle to Cook and he immediately hits Sir Geoff's corridor and Trott watches them pass then steers the third ball to gully's feet. A bit of low bounce is dug out by Trott \u2013 did that hit a crack? There's a red mark on the pitch. Trott takes a single just in front of square on the leg side, judiciously tip and running and Cook blocks the last. Will Sinclair, a Sydneysider, has this to say of The Gabba: \"It occurred to me this morning that the Gabba pitch is a metaphor for Queensland itself. Exciting and interesting for a couple of days \u2013 hot, dry and boring thereafter.\" Glad you said that Will, not me. 103rd Over: England 310-1 (Cook 132, Trott 54) The majestic Hilfenhaus resumes and, understandably, looks a bit tired. For those of you who don't know here's Bumble's response to the Twitter attack. Hilfenhaus sticks to an off-stump line and the fourth ball has more zip than the preceding three but Trott gets up and guides it downwards. No run. Maiden from Hilfenhaus, watchfully played by Trott. It's pretty empty in the stands out there. 104th Over: England 312-1 (Cook 134, Trott 54) Danny Clayton has had ITV4 rage: \"Regarding those ITV highlights I did know about them but took a decision to watch ITV4 +1 and watch MOTD2 at 10. Imagine my horror when I came across this message at 11: 'Sorry, for legal reasons we cannot broadcast the programme that was shown earlier on ITV4.' Can you imagine my rage? Furious.\" Not good, Danny. Siddle's round the wicket to Cook and he has to play at a couple of the first three balls, killing them into the legside. Siddle's grunting like a tennis player here, stretching to get some lift and makes Cook play and miss. But he pushes the next ball between midwicket and mid on and takes two. \"Re Bumble's Twitter abuse, does anyone know if Mitchell Johnson has an account?\" writes Gary Naylor. \"If Bumble has a look at that, he might feel better.\" Yes, there's getting abuse and then there's getting abuse. 105th Over: England 316-1 (Cook 135, Trott 57) Sky have just put up the Adelaide scoreboard from 2006 to make sure we're not too optimistic. It's the drunk at the party telling us we're all deluded and that a reckoning is due. Hilfenhaus is sticking to his plan and an off-stump line. Trott punches his fifth ball past mid off and scampers three and Cook turns the last ball to long leg to keep the strike. 106th Over: England 320-1 (Cook 139, Trott 57) Siddle is really bending his back and is getting some bounce, with that heavy ball that stings the hands. Seth Levine worries about the lack of home spectators: \"Sir Iron Bottom was just making the rather gloating observation that the Gabba crowd is almost exclusively English. Personally, I find it a worrying trend that Test match cricket is becoming the preserve, in terms of spectator interest, of the English. There seems to have been a lot of empty seats throughout this Test.\" It fills up when Australia are doing well. Cook gets a thickish edge that flies through the empty third slip place for four. And on 139 Cook now has England's highest Test score in Brisbane. As Thomas Botwell says: He's had his tribulations at home, but Cook's been pretty decent away from home for the past two years. 107th Over: England 320-1 (Cook 139, Trott 57) Solid start, this, as if Cook and Trott are doing what they'd said they'd do last night and imagine it was 0 for one and take it from there. Here's Sunder Katwala: \"Seems a bit unsporting of the Australian fans not to turn up, especially when there could still be a game on. Or is it just a bit of 'great sporting nation' bias to think there would be a pretty good home crowd in England on 5th day for a Test in this position? Can the OBO team identify the relevant examples to clear that one up please.\" I think we all know the answer to that one, Sunder. There seems to be some problem with the Gabba members and their usual privileges not being honoured. That may have something to do with the lack of numbers. The prices, though, are still cheaper than they are here. Maiden from Hilfenhaus. 108th Over: England 327-1 (Cook 146, Trott 57) Cook pulls Siddle for four, off the bottom edge, streakily down to the finest of fine legs. Here's Selve on the Brenkley baiters: \"bluntnortherner and billybowman have been longstanding and regular contributors to brenkley blogs for a considerable time. Obviously you know who Blunt is. I can't imagine who billy is. For the best stuff you need to go back to the Caribbean tour. bumble was going to include a chapter on the exchanges between us in his 'start the car' book but when he came to do the audio book, they kept stopping him, not understanding. So it was scrapped. Pity.\" Top work Selve, it was always a joy to log on and read how Mr Brinkley was being appreciated by blunt, billy and their various lady friends. Burt Bosma tells us: \"Umm \u2026 the reason there are empty seats at the Gabba is that it's Monday and, unlike the Brits, Irish and most of Europe, Australians pretty well all have jobs.\" Glorious cover drive from Cook and they run three. 109th Over: England 327-1 (Cook 146, Trott 57) The Gator Tracker has been seen by Ian Copestake, the gadget for the bleedin' obvious it seems: \"Morning, Rob. Channel Nine's Gator tracker is indeed in use. They had an umpire strapped to it yesterday. Seems their heart rate goes up when faced with a tough decision. No, honestly.\" Thanks, Ian. All the Australians are coming on like football supporters visiting Anfield and Goodison 20+ years ago. Here's Sarah Bacon, among many: \"Contrary to Sir Ian \u2013 and Seth Levine's \u2013 opinion, crowd figures over the past few days have been healthy from a 'home' perspective. They should both be reminded that (a) it's a Monday; and (b) Unlike the English, strangled as they're being by the worldwide recession, most Aussies still have jobs to go to.\" Maide from Hilfenhaus \u2013 I'm going to get a macro of that. 110th Over: England 337-1 (Cook 147, Trott 66) A ripsnorter from Siddle is dealt with very well by Trott, bouncing slightly higher than expected but he rode the bounce and turned it to midwicket and strolled a single. You can see, first innings wickets notwithstanding, why Siddle is so highly rated by his team-mates. There's a raw industriousness about him, that just relishes bowling. He then overpitches and Trott squirts it with an open face behind pint for four. And he follows it with another slightly streaky four. 111th Over: England 340-1 (Cook 150, Trott 66) Sir Ian is playing spot the Aussie much to his delight. Evelyn Williames has some evidence: \"Tickets for today's game only went on sale yesterday afternoon (apart from those who bought a ticket for every day) and I doubt many people expected a five-day game so wouldn't have taken the day off work. It's only $25 for a ticket, presumably to all areas, so very good value. The first three days were sell-outs or close to \u2013 yesterday only 21,000 but maybe everyone was watching at home on free-to-air. There are still people talking about an Australian win so it can't be just that they've given up hope though there's a fair bit of criticism around certain players and selections so enthusiasm for the team isn't at an all-time high.\" Huge delay while Ponting tinkers with the field before the start of Hilfenhaus's over. Gary Naylor! \"All these Aussies with jobs to go to - none of them seem to be working as 'Test Match Bowler'\". Very good. Except just as I pasted that Hilfenhaus hit a crack and nipped through Cook's gate with a fine delivery. Too wide, though. But Cook isn't rattled, punching his next ball through the covers and running three to get to 150 and the 150 partnership. The Barmies sing Ali Cook to the tune of Baby Give It Up. 112th Over: England 343-1 (Cook 152, Trott 67) Neill Brown points out pertinently that the sheer size of Australian grounds gives an unfair portrait: \"In terms of empty seats, has the crowd figures been announced (I doubt it, given how early it in the day)? It's all well and good saying there are lots of empty seats but the Gabba holds 40,000-odd. I went to the Boxing Day test at the MCG last year for Aussie v Pakistan and there was about 36,000 there. Of course that meant it was a third empty but it's still an impressive crowd.\" Here comes Johnson, the strike bowler who's now first change today but has been second so far in this Test. His arm really is as low as Lasith Malinga's at the moment. Both batsmen take comfortable singles. Is Vaughanie joining in with the Ali Cook song? Here's Dom O'Reilly: \"Listening to TMS while following OBO. Michael Vaughan has just told CMJ that he's a 'great advert for the Barmy Army'. And then repeated it. I feel he meant 'advocate' but I like the sound of Vaughan walking around Brisbane with 'Barmy Army' emblazoned on his clothing.\" Cook saunters a single to end the over. 113th Over: England 343-1 (Cook 152, Trott 67) The Australians are exercised by the attendance: \"I wouldn't buy the 'It's Monday, everyone's at work' explanation for low attendance. 'Chucking a sickie', particularly for sport, is a well established national trait here, and you can bet your bottom dollar that if the occasion held more promise there would be many more people at the ground.\" Amar Breckenridge, thanks for that and the positively Benaudesque bet your bottom dollar. Hilfenhaus went unmolested. 114th Over: England 343-1 (Cook 152, Trott 67) Eddy Richards would like some advice about his bedtime: \"So when will England be safe from losing? As a long time England follower I have an innate pessimism, in spite of recent apparent improvements in their fighting qualities. Obviously if they bat till tea, having scored another 150, they'll be OK, but at what point before that can I breathe a sigh of relief and go to bed? Half way through the second session? Nowadays, with teams used to scoring quick runs, I wouldn't fancy anything before that.\" It's looking safeish, honestly Eddy. Johnson again with a softish Kooka and though he's getting a bit of bounce there's nothing off the seam as Michael Holding points out. Thomas Bowtell has this insight on Cook: \"Cook's a month shy of his 26th birthday and has scored 4583 Test runs, at the same age, his mentor Graham Gooch (who ended up with 8,900) had a grand total of 547 runs. Not sure what point I'm trying to make, but there you go.\" I was watching the highlights with my mother-in-law this afternoon and she was convinced that Cook looks younger by the year. Dorian Gray portrait in the attic etc. Also that he's a very good looking chap. Maiden from Johnson. 115th Over: England 347-1 (Cook 156, Trott 67) David Holding asks: \"Tempting fate but when was the last time the top three English batsmen all scored 100s or 400 for for the loss of 1\". Thanks to Smyth we can tell you it's here and here are the times it's happened to Australia. Watson comes on for Hilfenhaus and he's targeting the cracks with more accuracy than the other three quicks. Cook thicke edges four off his last ball through the underpopulated slip area. Watson has what you would call a classic Yorkshire fast bowler's backside. I'll leave that observation there. 116th Over: England 355-1 (Cook 156, Trott 75) Here's Martin Kelner's take on Bumble from today's paper. Trott breaks the shackles and smashes Johnson through cover for four. Fine shot and then opens the face to smear the next wide of gully for four more. He's still gardening. Has there been a batsman more in his own concentration zone? Ed Packard has been doing some research of his own. \"For various reasons, I was googling for images of Bull and Smyth. The results are eclectic/horrific. 117th Over: England 360-1 (Cook 161, Trott 75) Another edge from Cook reaps four through the slips. Ponting has stationed himself in that off short mid on position, presumably to make Cook wary of using the bottom hand too much when turning straight balls to leg. Cook takes no notice, though, and shovels a single backward of square. Here's more on the empty seats from Richard Brenchley: \"I'm writing this at work, in Australia, during the day. To an English newspaper, at night. I'm dual nationality, and obviously in some confusion, as I've got you're live scorecard on the go. Anyway, just because I'm at work &amp; not filling the Gabba doesn't mean I'm actually working.\" I'm not really working, either, Richard. Huge roars as Michael Clarke drops a sitter in the slips, straight into his hands from Trott's low cut and straight out again. Wheels are coming off. Pretty ordinary as they say in Oz. 118th Over: England 370-1 (Cook 166, Trott 75) Here comes the slinger and Cook treats him with some contempt, belting a cut shot for four. With his angle of delivery, if he's wide it's a gimme. Both batsmen have white grips on their bats. Why that is I don't know. We only ever had a choice of black. White grips \u2026 luxury. Controlled hook from Cook and he takes a single. The replays of Clarke's drop keep coming. My God, Johnson has just bowled a huge wide for four, from round the wicket it flew to long leg. That was as bad as Harmison's from four years ago. He looks as if he doesn't have any confidence in his method at all and is just, as he said, whanging it down. Drinks. 119th Over: England 371-1 (Cook 167, Trott 75) Tim Lotherington asks: Did I hear the barmy army correctly signing 'God save YOUR queen' captured by Sky?\" You did as well as Rule Britannia. No Great Escape so far but the self-preservation society can't be far behind. Thinking of Bumble's experiences with the locals, wasn't Brisbane where John Crawley got chinned a few tours back? Laurence Davison says: \"After four years in the country my observation is that, outside of Melbourne, Australians generally don't turn up to stuff. The point about ground sizes is also well made and it's clearly embarrassing to see 10,000 people ratting about at a rugby league game in the Sydney Olympic stadium (capacity 80,000) but it doesn't necessarily foretell the impending demise of a sporting code. My impression is that people are more into this Ashes series than they have been any other cricket for a while, even if being into it in this case mainly consists of taking the piss out of me at a party on Saturday night.\" Did you have to go to Australia for people to take the piss on a Saturday night. It happens most Saturdays for me and that's just the wife. Here's the man Shane Warne calls EX-Avier Doherty. And his first ball turns but Cook turns it into the legside. Nicholas Mirzoeff has been eating Pumpkin Pie: \"Hello: It's the end of the long Thanksgiving weekend here in New York. The turkey has met the first of its annual slaughters and the general confusion about what actually happened with the indigenous population has passed. The way this is going I'm very tempted to head down to the local Australian bar, Eight Mile Creek, and enjoy the gloom. But it's probably safer to keep my English accent indoors.\" Humility till the fourth Test, Nick, that's the safest bet. Marie Meyer has a query: \"I've only ever seen Mitchell Johnson bowl against England. Anyone here ever see any of the matches that made him such a star? What did he used to do that he doesn't do now?\" Against South Africa he got bounce and movement at decent pace. He looks slow by comparison now. 120th Over: England 379-1 (Cook 175, Trott 75) Someone moves behind the sightscreen and makes Cook stop Watson in his tracks. Brad Haddin shouts \"Sit down, you muppet.\" And Mitchell Johnson sits down. Another fine cut shot from Cook takes him to 171, followed by a glorious cover drive for four to register his highest Test score. Clare Davies has the answer for white grips: \"Maybe Rob, it's in recognition of the white-covered land in which their fans are suffering Arctic conditions. I'm actually listening to TMS and following the OBO wearing a hat and mitts tonight.\" That was me last night, Clare. Scarf on in the house and a hat. 121st Over: England 387-1 (Cook 175, Trott 83) Do you think Johnson's brooding, now, in the field. It seems clear Ponting can't trust him and his chin has dropped. \"Are the batsmen sledging Johnson yet?\" asks Adam Hirst. \"They should be, just for fun. That or letting him take their wickets to boost his figures so he doesn't get dropped. Mind you, it isn't easy to get out to a bowler pitching it in the footmarks on his own side of the pitch, like that four wides delivery. I've only seen worse when somebody pitched one on his own front foot in league cricket.\" 'Ex' is round the wicket to Trott, good line at first then loose, short and wide and Trott rocks on to his back foot and creams four to third man, then more of an edge gets him four more. 122nd Over: England 388-1 (Cook 176, Trott 83) A single posts the 200 partnership. David Haslett has the info on the the man Ian Chappell called \"Second Innings SID\": \"No - John Crawley got punched in Cairns. The Mayor of Cairns came out with an interesting quote too: 'I'd like to catch the bloke who did this and give him a good boot up the backside.'\" Watson responds to the single with a bouncer to Trott who was caught on the front foot and hooked down in front of midwicket. Good improvisation but it looked ugly. 123rd Over: England 402-1 (Cook 182, Trott 83) Peter Black tells us to man up: \"There are only two possible outcomes of this Test and they are a draw or an England win. Get the Australians in for 45 overs looking for about 250 and they will wet their knickers. Some of the OBOers are a little too pessimistic. Or am I just blindly optimistic.\" Cook climbs in Doherty, dances down the wicket and lofts him for four. Doherty gets big turn from the rough and the ball skittles down the legside for four byes. Then Cook gets half down to sweep but it fizzes off a crack and four more byes. We have the Holy Grail of 400+ for one. Amazing. 124th Over: England 409-1 (Cook 182, Trott 89) Clare Davies has a word on that quote from Peter Roebuck. \"Rob, the Aussie Press do seem to be turning on their own quite quickly given that this in only the first Test. Always good fun to read of course but I found Roebuck's comment in a very grudging piece quite hard to swallow \u2013 while being critical of the Aussies, he just had to say this: 'Now England, or at any rate a team bearing that name \u2026' Where does that man get off? Does he know anything about international sport? Has he seen the weird and wonderful way in which the latest teams in rugby get their men? Just yesterday I watched a man who had played Under-19s for New Zealand get a cap for Samoa? And those athletes who change nationality depending on when the Olympics are? I think the ECB's requirements for playing for England are pretty tough. And I don't remember the Aussies ever calling Andrew Symonds a Brummie!!\" Or Khawaja a Pakistani. Roebuck is an Englishman, though, which makes it all the more odd. Trott gets four more through the vacant wide slips. As Rob Smyth points out that's 60 in the last eight and a half overs. Their tempo has been exemplary today and yesterday. 125th Over: England 409-1 (Cook 182, Trott 89) David Laslett, I stand corrected: \"I was so excited when that story about John Crawley and the Mayor of Cairns was published, but excitement quickly turned into despair when I saw you hadn't spelt my name correctly. I'd now like to boot you up the backside.\" Ouch, but deserved. Sorry. Shall I make the mother of all hostages to fortune? There has been some shambolic stuff from the Australians this morning, fielding and bowling. Ah \u2026 here's Warnie. And he says it's been pretty poor. \"Day five and the OBO readership is looking decidedly sober,\" writes Sarah Bacon. \"The first four days comprised a veritable catalogue of stomach-turning drops [limoncello, anyone?] accompanied by the requisite late-night drunken missives from pessimistic English fans. I know it's Monday, but surely you haven't given up on the demon drink yet with several crucial hours' play to go? Me? 5.32am in Dubai and I'm tucking into my first Bloody Mary. But then ... I'm Australian.\" I was going to have a swift half in the pub on the way here but then I chickened out. I'm not worthy. 126th Over: England 414-1 (Cook 184, Trott 92) This is the first time a side has ever got to four hundred for the loss of one wicket in the second innings of a match. Remarkable. Marcus North on now. Why doesn't Ponting have a bowl himself, or Katich, or Clarke. Captaincy by numbers? Warne, it transpires, was in the wrong box and has gone off to Channel 9 leaving Bumble flying solo. 127th Over: England 419-1 (Cook 188, Trott 93) James Duffy captures the odd sensation of being in this position for all England fans with longish memories: \"What I'm loving about this is just how unEnglish it is. We're never as unrelenting in piling on the runs; in snatching away what appeared a good winning position from the other side and making that side look foolish for ever being so confident. It's what other teams do to us.\" Well put, James. Lovely Cover drive off Doherty from Cook, against the spin. His foot movement has been a revelation. He's still got that trigger movement but he's added some daintiness to his repertoire now. Beefy reckons it's the perfect occasion to grind Australia under the heel and put down a marker for the rest of the series. 128th Over: England 419-1 (Cook 188, Trott 93) Lawrie Colliver's blogging for ABC here. What are you drinking, Lawrie. They seem to be calling Marcus North \"Snorts\" when he bowls a good one. He's bowling at Emburey pace here but it's not turning as much for him this innings. Maiden nonetheless. 129th Over: England 420-1 (Cook 189, Trott 93) William Kay's on the Pacifico, Clare Davies fruit tea and I'm on some caffeine kick with a low calorie beverage I think I've become addicted to despite it giving me palpitations after the fifth can. \"Doh\" resumes and Cook takes a single. 130th Over: England 430-1 (Cook 199, Trott 93) Colin Gray thinks Roebuck may not have been as damning as we think: \"Englishman in New Zealand here following the game. I personally think Roebuck is brilliant \u2013 both on Aussie radio and in print. When I read that line from him I actually thought it was a backhanded compliment to the fighting spirit England had demonstrated (ie they look more Australian than the Aussie team), rather than a crack at the foreign born players.\" That's certainly a view, Col, that I'd have more sympathy with given how much I've admired his writing. Great expansive batting from Cook with a pair of scintillating boundaries and a two that takes him to 199. They're milking old Snorts now. 131st Over: England 432-1 (Cook 200, Trott 94) Paddle sweep from Trott puts Cook on strike and with a chance to become the fifth Englishman to score a Test double hundred in Australia. And he does it thanks to a misfield after Australia had a Hussain/Richard Dawson moment and tried to keep him waiting. It's his highest ever score \u2013 200 off 361 balls. 132nd Over: England 434-1 (Cook 201, Trott 95) Snorts comes in and Cook straight bats his first two balls. William Sinclair points out, not unreasonably: \"I wouldn't get too carried away with this record breaking England performance, Rob. Remember, we've seen two top order wickets (three if you include Haddin, which is a stretch) in two and a half days\u2026\" Carried away us, William? We're English damn it. 133rd Over: England 439-1 (Cook 201, Trott 100) Mtthew Hardy writes: \"I'm an Australian comedian (truly, though rarely as funny as yourselves or your contributors: keep up the great work etc), currently working/living in London, who has endured disrupted shows all weekend due to 'our' (Australian cricket team) haphazard, rapid unravelling. Crowds hear my accent and it's apparently 'game on'. All in good spirits and nothing I cant handle but relentless for the whole half-hour nonetheless. \"You're all losers baby, so why don't we kill you\" was one makeshift sing-a-long, appropriating the break-out hit by Beck. Amusing, agreed, but good grief. And as for stomach-turning drops to steel the spine, who can beat 8 year old Baileys (it's all my sleeping UK girfriend has left in her stash), after an earlier bottle of white wine? Could choose not to booze but the score's sent me into self-harm mode.\" Where's the punchline Matthew? How did you deal with the hecklers? And Trott picks off two then sort of flat bats it to mid off before taking an easy three to midwicket, turned off his pads. Two Ashes Tests for Trott and two second-innings centuries. What resilience. That's lunch. Thanks for your emails, I'll be back after tea. Please email Rob Smyth with your afternoon thoughts. Lunch: Rob Smyth will be here in 15 minutes or so. Here's Liz Rippin: \"A double century and a century in the space of five minutes? If that isn't cause for a celebratory Creme de Menthe then I don't know what is!\" Hmm! Creme de Menthe. Hello again. Everyone remembers Trent Bridge 1989. Geoff Marsh and Mark Taylor batting throughout the first day. The nadir's nadir. Yet it's often forgotten that the second day was hardly a laugh riot either. At various stages Australia were 329-0, then 430-1, then 502-3. Eventually they had a dramatic collapse of six wickets for 231 runs before declaring on 602 for six. (England were soon one for two and 14 for three, but that's another story.) I remember lying on my bed, idling away the summer holidays like any other working-class kid who didn't know any better, flicking back and forth between that on BBC1 and Scooby Doo on ITV (seriously, watching Scooby Doo at the age of 13. Psychoanalysis please!), wondering if I'd ever see England pose such absurd high-rise scores. And today I did. They reached 434 for one after an amazing morning session in which Australia's fielding went to pieces in a way you would not believe. They mentally disintegrated. They gave showers a bad name. They were slaughtered in their own Gabbatoir. And they had to endure the bloody Barmy Army laughing it all up. It's bad enough being abused from all sides, but now even Statsguru has turned against Australia. The morning produced all manner of statistics to quantify the perception that they are now just an average side. Here are a few: \u2022 England reached the highest-ever score for the loss of only one wicket in the second innings of a Test. \u2022 Alastair Cook became only the seventh opener to score a Test double-hundred against the Aussies. (His second against them, after that tour match in 2005.) \u2022 England's top three scored centuries for only the second time in Tests, and the first since 1924. \u2022 The top three scored centuries against Australia for only the second time in a Test, and the first since 1986. You can find millions more. I've been like a pig in Statsguru all morning. Four-hundred and thirty-nine for one. Four-hundred and thirty-nine for one. This really is surreal. Nobody would script this. David Lynch wouldn't script this in his wildest dreams. David Lloyd wouldn't script this in his wildest dreams. Tw**ter update Remember that business with @theashes yesterday? Well now her Mom has lumbered in! When my colleague Jacob Steinberg sent me the link, saying \"It's @theashes' Mom\", I feared some Milf-related tomfoolery. Better still, we got this. These quotes don't really require any further comment. luvshorses68 Dawn Kerekes OMG cant even believe my daughter is mistaken with a cricket match You know if people in Australia and England knew how to type proper grammer they would @theashes DONT change your name if people cant type with captial letters SCREW Themnot have this problem. @theashes big difference between TheAshes and theashes She's less Milf, more Milttafwget (a Mom I'd like to teach a few wee grammar essentials to, since you didn't ask) 134th over: England 441-1 (Cook 201, Trott 102) Mitchell Johnson, who appears hell-bent on proving that 2009 wasn't - as we previously thought - hisAshes horribilis, starts after lunch. Trott drives him nicely through extra cover for a couple. In the commentary box talk turns to Adelaide, and possible changes. None for England - next! - but apparently there is talk that Australia will bring in Smith for North and Bollinger for Johnson. I don't like changing a side after one Test unless the circumstances are truly exceptional. I suppose you could argue they are for Johnson, who is all over the place, but it still doesn't sit comfortably. That said, I think Bollinger will give England significant agita at some stage in this series. \"Rob,\" says Mac Millings. \"Some clown with too much time on his hands has created a Rob Smyth wikipedia page. Just saying.\" Oh Millings, my Millings. That's extremely amusing, but I just need to talk to you about some of those apostrophes... 135th over: England 442-1 (Cook 202, Trott 102) Xavier Doherty bowls a tidy over that brings one run. \"Your views on strategy please, Rob?\" says Chris Wright. I'd just bat on all day, allow Australia's humiliation to marinate. With Adelaide starting in three days' time, there's no real need to give the fast bowlers any more work. There would be two reasons to declare: in the hope of winning, and in the hope of landing some psychological blows like at Headingley in 1994. No chance of either on this pitch, so the best thing to do is to land psychological blows by batting on and on and on and then - when Ponting offers to call the game off halfway through the final hour - batting on some more. Put 60 more overs in these Australian bowlers' legs. 136th over: England 443-1 (Cook 203, Trott 102) Johnson's radar is more Jackson Pollock than Shaun Pollock. It's shocking stuff, all over the show. Cook pings one off the pads but Watson at short midwicket fields well. \"Referral system in Scrabble doesn't work,\" says Anus McGuigan. \"BELIEVE ME. I tried it during a game, but lost both lives when challenging words that subsequently proved to be in the dictionary. Then nursey putting down words that were clearly made up (ZDOTN for example). With no challenges left, I was doomed. My letter to the ICC was strongly worded. But immaculately spelt.\" Tell it to Ashes Mom. 137th over: England 444-1 (Cook 204, Trott 102) The game is drifting, with just one coming from that Doherty over. England's sedate start after lunch suggests they have no thoughts of victory. That might not be very exciting, but it's entirely realistic and also sensible given the fact that we are at the start of a five-Test series squeezed into seven weeks. Bull had a lovely thing going on yesterday, and for once I'm not referring to that shambling noir chic he pulls off so effortlessly. He started a riff about OBOers in unlikely places, prompting some charming stories, and here's another. \"The call to prayer echos across the Diplomatic Quarter of Riyadh before every dawn,\" says Peter Hall, \"but this morning it was a very welcome early morning call: 'get up and watch the cricket'. What a nice morning it is!\" 138th over: England 449-1 (Cook 205, Trott 106) That's a fine, trademark shot from Trott, working Johnson off the hip and through midwicket for four. He plays that shot remorselessly. \"She's supporting England!\" says Patrick Viner. \"You go girl!\" Right here, right now, Jonathan Trott has a Test average of 58.45. 139th over: England 452-1 (Cook 208, Trott 106) \"It's a statsfest!\" says Bumble on Sky as Alastair Cook drives Doherty for three, moving past Nasser Hussain's 207 as the highest score by an Essex batsman in an Ashes Test. The Sky boys have moved on to talking about Monopoly. \"What d'ya reckon would be, he'd be the top hat,\" says Bumble. He's on fire today, going off on all sorts of tangents. \"Mrs Lloyd asked me for one of those i- things: an iPod or an iPad. I bought here an iRon.\" Honk! 140th over: England 457-1 (Cook 209, Trott 106) Johnson snakes in to bowl to Cook and Harmisons a shocking delivery miles down the leg side for four byes. Haddin does well to stop a repeat next ball. This is a full-scale meltdown, and pretty sad to see really. Nobody deserves this. \"I think Peter Roebuck has long since made a professional decision to relinquish his Englishness and attack it with even greater venom than most Australians do,\" says Chris Wright. \"He seems embarrassed by it. Many of his columns feature sentences like 'drier than a Pommy's towel'. I find it very odd.\" 141st over: England 457-1 (Cook 209, Trott 106) Doherty is into his 30th over, still wicketless. Shades of another left-arm spinner, Clive Eksteen, in Atherton's match all those years ago. He so nearly gets a wicket when Cook chips one low to Ponting, diving forward at short midwicket. Ponting did not celebrate, and the umpires went to the TV replay. Once you do that with low catches, there is only one outcome: Cook survives. As so often in these cases, instinct suggests it was probably a clean catch, but the third umpire could not have given that with a clear conscience. Ponting is very unhappy. He has a few words with Aleem Dar and then storms off shouting \"piss-weak umpiring\". Part of the confusion was Ponting's non-celebration: at first you thought that was an admission that he did not know whether it carried, but in fact it was just because of the score. He was certain he had caught it, and of course he is Test cricket's premier advocate of trusting the fielder's word. You can completely understand his frustration, although calling the umpires \"piss-weak\" isn't fair. The system is at fault, not them. 142nd over: England 466-1 (Cook 214, Trott 110) \"That is filth from Mitchell Johnson\" says Nasser Hussain when Cook blazes a short, wide delivery up and over backward point for four. He is 13 runs away from making England's highest Test score since Graham Gooch's 333 in 1990. This, as a few of you have pointed out, is the daddy hundred of which Gooch and Cook are so beloved. What a staggering performance. \"Earlier on, someone defended the presence of wall-to-wall South African in the England team by claiming that Andrew Symonds was a Pom,\" says Burt Bosma. \"Say that to his face and you'd have no face three seconds later. He came to Australia when he was five months old and learnt all his cricket here. You can't compare that to Trott and Pietersen, who learnt their cricket in South Africa and still mentally translate pounds into rand.\" Arf. I'm still chuckling at the businesslike 'Say that to his face and you'd have no face three seconds later.'. 143rd over: England 476-1 (Cook 218, Trott 115) Cook takes a couple of steps down the track to Doherty and crashes him majestically through mid-off for four. He then survives a big LBW shout when he misses a sweep. That looked a pretty decent shout. The only thing that could have saved Cook was getting outside the line - and replays show that he was, indeed, fractionally outside the line. That is yet another exceptional decision from Aleem Dar. Gee he is good. From the next ball, Trott plays a gorgeous straight drive for four more. 144th over: England 485-1 (Cook 223, Trott 119) Cook hooks Watson contemptuously for four, and then he is dropped by Ponting. Unreal. Cook went for a big drive and it flew off the edge to Ponting in a wide slip position. He dived to his right but couldn't hold on. That was a sharp chance but, even so, I've never seen Australia this ragged in the field. And nobody - not even Richie Benaud, not even Uncle Statsguru - has seen a side on a score of 485 for one against Australia. It is the first time in Test history that a team has passed 450 for the loss of only one wicket against them. This is astonishing, and Trott adds to the mood by lifting Watson disdainfully back over his head for four. Ridiculous. 145th over: England 487-1 (Cook 224, Trott 120) On Sky, Warne and Atherton reckon England should declare. They know a wee bit about cricket between them, so I'm now hastily rewriting earlier entries to the contrary on this subject. \"Peter Roebuck,\" says Chris Pitts, \"is a very, very naughty boy.\" 146th over: England 494-1 (Cook 225, Trott 126) Trott drives Watson for a single to bring up \u2013 and you'll like this \u2013 the 300 partnership. The 300 partnership. The 300 partnership. The 300 partnership. Trott is now batting like a dream, and he waves Watson gorgeously wide of extra cover for four. \"I am listening to TMS on the internet as I follow the OBO, and it is really disturbing me how the otherwise excellent Simon Hughes keeps saying things like dirty bowling, or dirty comes in again, here are dirty's figures or this is dirty's last ball of this over,\" says Phil Keegan. \"What is he talking about?\" Ha. Have you seen the film Kissing Jessica Stein? In that, one of the lead characters prescribes dropping the word 'sexy' into conversation in as many ways different ways as possible, to hint tantalisingly at an ocean of cerebral sexuality lurking a millimetre below the surface. Or something. 147th over: England 502-1 (Cook 229, Trott 127) Yet another statgasm: England have, for the first time in Test history, gone past 500 for the lost of only one wicket. Nurse, the Wisdens! First Cook clouted Doherty sexily over mid-on for four, and then there were four byes when Doherty speared a yorker down leg. Ricky Ponting can only smile wryly as another piece of his empire goes into the river. I wonder what odds you'd have got on England being 500-1? 500-1 maybe? I bet Dennis Lilee never thought they'd see that in Ashes Test ever again. \"Can we all just agree to knock this one on the head?\" says Tom Godfrey. \"I'll crack on with an honest afternoon's work, in preparation for a oh-so-ineffective Friday. Meanwhile, you lot up north stock up on sleep and creme de menthe for Round 2?\" It's weird to see an Ashes Test meandering to a draw. Apart from two heavily rain-affected contests at Lord's in 1997 and Edgbaston in 2009, it hasn't happened since 1987-88. 148th over: England 505-1 (Cook 230, Trott 128) Marcus North is on for Mitchell Johnson (27-5-1004-0). Nothing happens. Mike Atherton wonders what Australia would least like England to do. I still think the sexy answer to that is bat on. \"This is the first day I haven't been to the Gabba, having had too much $7.00 mid strength beer and a back that has been destroyed by those plastic chairs in your photo,\" says Andrew Jolly. \"I'm now sitting here with the single man's holy trinity of cricket on the TV, and OBO and Football Manager on the laptop. I have never seen Australians look so dejected either on the field or in the streets or in the stands - its fantastic. Australians under the age of 30 or so just have never seen their attack being so brutally demoralised in this manner - to the point where the Barmy Army were chanting \"Are you England in disguise\" yesterday. I just can't wait to go back into work tomorrow, especially as all my colleagues were bombarding me with sledge e-mails and texts during Saturday.\" DRINKS BREAK Here is a sexy list of the highest Test scores up to the loss of the second wicket. I see it, but I still don't really believe it. 149th over: England 509-1 (Cook 231, Trott 131) Alastair Cook's 230 is the highest Test score at the Gabba, ahead of Don Bradman's 226 against some poor helpless suckers back in the day. There's a statgasm per over at the moment. Trott works Doherty to leg for a couple. \"Any chance you could plug mine and Jarrod's video diary if you think it worthy?\" says Sam Collins. \"Two pricks at the Ashes...\" Actually I meant to plug this earlier - it's very good, I almost smiled once - but totally forgot as England roared past 850. 150th over: England 513-1 (Cook 233, Trott 133) Trott takes a sharp single to mid-off. Watson hits the stumps but Trott was home. A few more singles take the score up to 512 for one. It's 512 for one. Someone should make an emoticon for this, although I don't know if one graphic can simultaneously portray confusion, joy, incredulity, delirum, delirium tremens, confusion, joy and multiple statgasms. \"There is now a Twitter campaign (#gettheashestotheashes) to persuade Qantas to get @theashes on a plane to Australia,\" says Scott Collier. \"Which rather makes me wish I had thought of that username.\" Sod that. I'm more interested in #gettheashesmomoncountdowninsusiedent'schair. Imagine that. 151st over: England 515-1 (Cook 234, Trott 134) \"A wikipedia entry for Rob Smyth and no mention of his experimentation in underground Berbarotica?\" says Jonathan Francis. \"Someone needs to correct this glaring oversight.\" Thankfully not any old clown can update Wikipedia, otherwise you'd have some joker in his bedroom in America inventing scurrilous stories about Monster Munch and the like. 152nd over: England 517-1 declared (Cook 235, Trott 134) Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson are in the nets, which suggests England will be bowling at some stage. Paul Collingwood is putting his pads away, a big dumb grin etched all over his face. England probably won't need him to save this one for them. Indeed, there comes the declaration from Andrew Strauss. This has been an extraordinary innings, one that nobody on the planet could have imagined. Cook ends on 235, Trott on 135, their partnership an unbeaten 329 and England's lead 296. It hurst just trying to comprehend those statistics. I'm off for a 182-second power nap; see you back here in a few minutes for the Australian innings. INNINGS BREAK The score in this series is still 0-0. It doesn't feel like it though, eh. There are 41 overs remaining for England to take 10 wickets and change that score. No, no it won't. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (target: 297; Watson 0, Katich 0) A good, straight first over is defended well by Watson. England certainly fancy him for LBW early on. This is a great email from Ranajit Dam, a tale of what happens when life doesn't quite pan out as you'd expect. \"This reminds me of that time, back in the day, when I used to play EA Sports' Cricket 07. I once decided to bat as long as possible at Level 2 (the toughest being level 5); the openers got to 2043/0 (or something) at around lunch on the second day before I finally gave up decided to look for a life. Too bad Trott and Cook don't have Day 6. I currently don't play Cricket 07 any more, but I don't think I've found that life yet.\" 2nd over: Australia 2-0 (target: 297; Watson 0, Katich 2) Broad goes straight around the wicket to Katich, the plan being to aim for the massive crack not far from a good length. Katich misses an attempted cut but is otherwise fairly untroubled. Broad is steaming in with purpose to three slips but, while this is not a 517-1 pitch, nor is it a 51-7 pitch. I'd be amazed if we had any drama. \"I work at Channel 9 in Australia and being the lone Pom in the office I thought I'd show off and wore my England shirt into work on the first day of the Test,\" says Tony King. \" we all know what happened that day. Needless to say I got a hammering from pretty much everyone at the station, even the CEO came by to have a pop. To make matters worse I was still wearing the shirt for our Xmas party that night and kept getting asked to leave. I'm feeling pretty smug right now, but do I wear my shirt in again for the first day of the next Test and potentially suffer the same fate?\" As the saying doesn't go, do what your native co-workers least want you to do. So wear it. I like the idea of the T-shirt being the reason you were repeatedly asked to leave, rather than the swaying, the leering and all the other ailments that afflict the Englishman abroad. Or at home. Anywhere there's booze, basically. Peculiar coincidence. 3rd over: Australia 2-0 (target: 297; Watson 0, Katich 2) The ball isn't swinging much, but Anderson is extremely accurate and again Watson is restricted to defence. Another maiden, and here's William Kay, in praise of my legendary people skills. \"\"Here in Tijuana, you have started a full-scale argument. Foolishly I agreed with you, let the Aussies bowl all day. My Mexican wife, who has been following the game for a year now, is convinced that a declaration should be made, and victory should be achieved. As she puts it: Before the match started, everyone was cautiously optimistic of victory. She is convinced that 'cautious optimism' is just a way that the English self-delude themselves. At the moment the Aussies have rolled over and died, she wants us to 'put our boots on their necks and squeeze the life out of them'. She is a very loving and caring person. She just doesn't like people upsetting her English husband, and for what the Aussies did on the third day, they MUST suffer. Gotta lurve my wife.\" 4th over: Australia 4-0 (target: 297; Watson 0, Katich 3) Broad is wided on height for a bouncer to Katich. That's been a feature of this match, and must surely be the result of an ICC directive. I wonder how Bumble feels in the Sky box, watching all these wides being given. Only 14 years too late. \"So everyone else has gone to bed at this hostel in Patagonia - one month into four months travelling in South America where lack of Ashes coverage is the only sour note,\" says Charlie Talbot. \"Which means I\u00b4ve just managed to stay on the computer long enough to find a working feed for the first time this Test - Tony Greig describing it as 'QWAR-NAGE'. Is this really happening? And how much of a bad idea is it to stay awake until a 6am two-day bus to El Chalten? Surely nothing will happen will it? If we couldn\u00b4t get make Ponting crack at Old Trafford 2005 we won\u00b4t do it here. And how have I managed to be booked into trekking around beautiful national parks looking at stunningly beautiful glaciers with the wife during the next Test? It seems all the young kids these days travel with netbooks, they don't even remember a time when finding one dial-up connection per village seemed advanced, never mind waiting for a newspaper three days later to find out how Martin McCague had bowled. I was impressed with grabbing an OBO update on the iPhone every time I walked into a wifi hotspot, but Tony Greig describing the Aussies being flayed for 500-1 in a wood cabin in Patagonia is just too weird. I must be dreaming.\" 5th over: Australia 5-0 (target: 297; Watson 0, Katich 4) Anderson beats Watson with a beautiful delivery that cut away just enough to beat the edge. The match is winding down really. I like this period of a drawn Test, where we all have our last drink before the lights go on and try to make sense of what has happened before moving on to the next match. It'll take a helluva long time to make sense of this game. WICKET! Australia 5-1 (Katich c Strauss b Broad 4) England's day just gets better. Katich fiddled unnecessarily at a shortish delivery outside off stump, bowled from around the wicket, and Strauss took a straightforward catch at first slip. \"I'm here,\" says Sarah Bacon. \"In Dubai. Contemplating third Bloody Mary. This is $!&amp;\u00a3-ing dire. Hic.\" 6th over: Australia 6-1 (target: 297; Watson 0, Ponting 1) Ricky Ponting is booed to the wicket by a phalanx of morons. One of the all-time greats, treated like something out of a pantomime. That crap disgusts me. He is greeted by a bouncer from Broad that he completely ignores, and then awkwardly shovels one into the leg side to get off the mark. \"Didn't Peter Roebuck suffer the ignominy of captaining an England A side to defeat in a tour of the Netherlands?\" says Greg Wilkinson. \"Perhaps that is the source of his self-loathing\u2026\" What's our excuse? Yeah, he did. Decent England team too, with eight past or future Test players in it, although for the life of me I can't remember SJ Base's first name. 7th over: Australia 11-1 (target: 297; Watson 0, Ponting 6) Anderson turns Ponting round with a good delivery. The ball squirts into the off side and Ponting sets off for a quick single. There is no chance of a run out, but Pietersen throws the ball anyway, miles wide of the stumps and away for four. Anderson is justifiably radged off and has a few words with Pietersen. He takes his frustration out on Watson with a storming leg-cutter that beats the defensive grope. Watson has 0 from 20 balls, and that's tea. I'm off to repeatedly shake my head and mumble '517 for one'. Thanks for all your emails throughout this Test. Rob Bagchi will be here for the final session: email him on rob.bagchi@theguardian.com TEA \"I'm in a hotel room in Miami Beach with a dodgy internet connection and I'm reading that England are 517-1. If only! Real score please?\" Ho, ho, James Hobbs. What a couple of days \u2013 Trott and Cook batting for more than an entire day and reducing Australia to the sort of raggedy performance that will have had memories of the pre-Border backbone transplant team under Kim Hughes against the Windies. And then to get Katich, too, in that brief dart before tea. Heady days indeed. Chris Drew is in France: \"Just switched on here in France, and even though it's only quarter to sparrow's, my day has been made already. Glad England are rubbing the Aussie's noses a little bit. Tried to explain cricket to a local yesterday via the medium of stickcricket. It didn't work...\" Did you try French cricket, or Katich's stance as it's now known? Here's Dan Jackson in WA: \"I'm loving this (both your OBO and the state of the test), sitting at work in Perth surrounded by my Aussie colleges, they finally seem to be taking this team seriously.\" It's taken a long time, they tend to write off 2005 and 2009, but this team is a credible threat and one that takes bad sessions in their stride, unlike the deep bouts of self-doubt that used to take hold of them in the past after a pasting. The teeth, the horror: Jez Wyke sends this re Shane Warner: \"His teeth are glowing in the dark! I seem to remember that was on of the signs of impending apocalypse.\" They're luminous, indeed. Jamie in Melbourne has this insight: \"The Labor (sic) government here in Melbourne is on the brink of being turfed out after the weekend's election. Everyone is waiting on some kind of resignation announcement from current Premier. Some Aussie colleagues just asked if there had been any news and I was very happy to tell them that England had just past the 500 mark. Roll on Boxing Day.\" Went out at lunch to try to bag some food. Kings Cross 2am. It's Ginsters Paradise. Seamus Byrne has Cardiff revenge on his mind: \"I'm annoyed because I was prepared for THIS before day one. Then Siddle, Hussey and Haddin had to go and build my hopes up again! What will save this Test for me is if we get to 9-down and Strauss just can't take the last one\u2026 fast forward to Sydney and a series still in the balance and the screams of 'if only' will ring in your ears like Cardiff '09 still does for us. I count 15 wasted overs after lunch. And Joe Johnston says \"Tend to write off 2005 and 2009? Really? Must be because of 2006-07 stuck in the middle there, not that anyone over there would know about that.\" We all know about it, Joe. But it wasn't a case of the old order reasserting itself. It was a team in disarray, badly led and in transition. 8th over: Australia 17-1 (target: 297; Watson 5, Ponting 7) Mikey Holding reckons they'll try to play some big shots to show they're not at all cowed. BRoad begins with another short ball that Ponting rides around the corner. Very odd field for Watson with a short mid off and short midwicket. A beauty from Broad, almost a leg cutter that Watson leaves. Watson clips a legside delivery down to fine leg for four. Andrew Goulden feels a T-shirt coming on: \"I'm not sure if it's already been mentioned but a T-shirt with '517-1, it doesn't get any better' would look pretty natty I feel. Maybe having a picture of a downcast Ponting underneath would really set it off. Or a shot of Johnson dropping that catch off Strauss. Either would do nicely.\" OBO Enterprises in on the case. Watson takes a single bringing Ponting on to strike and he plays the last ball with a slightly wobbly bat. Broad does hit the deck remarkably hard. 9th over: Australia 26-1 (target: 297; Watson 14, Ponting 7) Anderson's been pretty much on the money from the start, off-stump line, fullish length and he's getting good carry. Slightly overpitches his third ball, though and Watson drives it arrow straight down the ground for four. He then cuts and runs four. James Hudson is taking pleasure where he can: \"I'm living in the comforts of a possible war zone in Seoul, South Korea - just 30 miles from the border with the North. I've got an emergency survival bag ready in case we have to do one but not even the threat of a nuclear winter can tear me away from how much I'm loving the shelling of the Ozzies.\" 10th over: Australia 30-1 (target: 297; Watson 17, Ponting 8) Jimmy Anderson and Ricky Ponting exchanged a few words and the umpires had to get involved. The stump mic was turned down as it started so not sure what was said. Here comes Broad and he gives Ponting the hurry-up with one that lifts and jags back into him and he underedges it into his box. Broad is diplomatically carrying on where Anderson left off with a few pithy phrases. Here's Steven Littlewood: \"Rob, as a fellow Englishman I can appreciate your confusion but your use of \"(sic)\" following Jamie of Melbourne referring to a Labor government was incorrect. The word labour is spelled the same in Australia as in the UK but the ALP is in fact called the Australian Labor Party, not the Labour Party as in the UK. This is due to the fact that King O'Malley, one of the ALP's founders, was American-born and considered that the US spelling was more modern.\" I din't sic it James. I'm too shagged out to be bothered sicing anything this morning. 11th over: Australia 36-1 (target: 297; Watson 18, Ponting 13) Graeme Swann comes into the attack with a silly point, short leg, slip and short midwicket. Good flight and dip with the first ball then Ponting hits a beautiful ondrive for four. Thanks for the colour, James Rees, but sadly the lawyers are watching. Oh and Collingwood drops Watson, an easyish chance, at first slip. 12th over: Australia 36-1 (target: 297; Watson 18, Ponting 13) Paul Connelly writes: \"You know, if every match turns out this way, the Aussies will retain the Ashes, don't you? I'm not trying to rain on your parade, but not getting hammered isn't the same as winning.\" If they held them, they would Paul. But they don't. Steve Hudson is feeling lyrical: \"Just woken and seen the score. Oh, sweet mystery of life, at last I have found you\u2026\" Broad pegs Watson back on his crease and the fifth ball keeps worryingly low but Watson digs it out. James Elroy puts the call out in Argentina: \"In Buenos Aires, here working on a film and my american colleges are at a loss to why i'm so oddly tired these past few days. I told them I had met a girl, didn't want to confuse them by mentioning the word cricket, let alone the ashes. I'm giddy now. Bbeen watching in fake Irish pubs with a distinct lack of Irish and they keep changing the channel and I have to bribe them to change it back- they are fleecing me but I really don't care. Any English folk here want to jeer at two Aussie backpackers?\" Message passed on. Maiden from Broad. 13th over: Australia 37-1 (target: 297; Watson 18, Ponting 14) Swann returns with the swagger still in his stride and tempts Watson to swish outside leg and Prior whips the bails off. Good flight and not as short as he was in the first innings. Sara Torvalds, what have you done? \"OK, Colly's drop in the 11th over was my fault - I just woke up to see the end of the match, but I should know there are no Aussie wicket unless I'm asleep (see 23rd over, day 4). I'm sorry. I'm grovelling. I'll try to go right back to sleep, I promise!\" 14th over: Australia 40-1 (target: 297; Watson 20, Ponting 15) Broad is sticking to his off-stump line for Watson \u2013 the old lbw ploy hasn't come into service yet since tea. He's bowling well with vim and the usual line in aggression. Watson gets the maker's name out a couple of times and plays the ball back to the bowler. Oliver Pattenden thinks we may be talking about this for years but not for the right reasons: \"Is it not slightly tragic how exciting it is for us English to gloat over this score that is ultimately going to lead to a draw? I mean, we're all so proud of being able not to be beaten by Australia... still, remember that time England declared on 517-1 in Brisbane Rob? Ay? It was grand, it was...\" Grand, indeed, Gromit. 15th over: Australia 43-1 (target: 297; Watson 22, Ponting 16) Tim Grey gets relief in Melbourne: \"I'm still here, albeit sitting in my office in (moderately) sunny Melbourne where the locals have gone strangely quiet; I haven't heard a reference to warm beer or soap-dodging all day, long may it continue!\" Brief hesitation almost gets Ponting into run-out trouble but Watson sprints through to make his ground. \"Sat here in Woodstock NY USA listening to Aggers guest on the ABC radio feed and they just gave us a slightly better aural glimpse of the Barmy Army,\" writes Mark Zip. I swear I heard Billy Cooper playing Love Will Tear Us Apart. Have you or any of the other OBO'ers any idea what the Army sings to this otherwise blissfully morose tune?\" They have taken Ian Curtis's words, Mark, and switched Broad for love. 16th over: Australia 54-1 (target: 297; Watson 22, Ponting 26) Here comes the Finn. And he tries an inswinging yorker first up but over pitches and Ponting launches into it with a lovely straight drive for four and then a trademark swivel pull for four. Fred Lane says: \"Despite their macho image, Aussies are very sensitive. They fail to win a game of cricket, and there's talk of changing their government.\" Ha. Finn pitches short gain and Ponting ducked into it and it clips him on the earpiece. Kat Petersen is thinking of doing a gloating wake-up call: \"I have just woken up from migraine-induced hallucinations to see the genuine score (though it took much blinking to convince me), but the only person to share with as my sister who is German - shouting \"517-1! 517!!!\" doesn't quite have the same effect if you then have to spend ten minutes trying to explain the basic concepts of cricket. I am waiting for my Aussie housemate to wake up so I can share the news with her instead...\" She'll love you for that, Kat. 17th over: Australia 62-1 (target: 297; Watson 23, Ponting 33) We have a lot of correspondents in Seoul this morning, keeping calm and carrying on. \"I'm sat here in north east Seoul, about 20 miles from the DMZ, just waiting for Kim Jong-Il to rain down fire on me, \" writes John Allen. \"Still, when he does at least I'll have the memory of 517-1 to go out with with. Thanks boys!\" Looser from Swann and leaking singles to the deep fielders on the legside. Ponting finsihes the over by going down on one knee and thwacking Swann for six over mid on. 18th over: Australia 68-1 (target: 297; Watson 24, Ponting 38) This has been a fine, positive partnership from Ponting and Watson, a bit like Strauss and Cook at the beginning of yesterday's play. Finn keeps feeding Ponting's pull but he hasn't got the pace, and neither has this pitch, to be effective unless Ponting misjudges the length. He doesn't and spanks him for four just in front of square. Too short from Finn, in general so far. David Welch says: \"11 runs of the last over, so they are scoring at the required rate... I'm still picking the upset victory here. What a foolish declaration! Go Australia!\" Slim pickings, David. But they're playing very well. 19th over: Australia 71-1 (target: 297; Watson 24, Ponting 41) Time for the Monty Panesar song as Swann keeps it tight and Ponting opens the face of his bat to steer it past slip for three and Watson gets very far forward and over the ball in two identical forward defensives. 20th over: Australia 77-1 (target: 297; Watson 29, Ponting 41) Ponting gets over another short ball from Finn and toes a pull for a single. \"I'm with David Welch. Ponting and Watson should get on with it and win this Test match. It will be like Adelaide in 2006, only better,\" writes Matt Kwan. We try not to talk about Adelaide around here. Matt. Very poor form. Watson unveils his hook now and blasts it through midwicket for four. Not good from Finn this innings so far. And another legside ball is pushed for a single. His last is better, forcing Ponting on to the back foot with an assured backward defensive. 21st over: Australia 83-1 (target: 297; Watson 31, Ponting 41) Swann spins his first ball and the second rips past the bat and goes for four byes down the legside. The second two don't turn and Watson, playing for the spin squirts edges to short third man and gets two off the fourth ball. Big talk of Mitchell Johnson getting dropped, apparently gleaned from someone overhearing Greg Chappell saying he was on borrowed time. Good morning Neil Gouldson: \"I'm currently working as a kindergarten teacher in Guangzhou, China. I've been sat in the computer room on my lunch break, which started at 11am our time and goes on til 3pm, surrounded by the entirely female staff, following OBO. They are wondering why I am looking so delighted at the moment, but the language barrier alone deters me from any attempted explanation. God knows how I'll explain myself if the wickets start to tumble!\" 21st over: Australia 86-1 (target: 297; Watson 31, Ponting 44) Finn's going to get a lengthy spell though he doesn't look at his best, in the low 80mphs and more than a tad too much variation in length. When he pitches it up, as he does twice to Watson, he looks impressive and keeps Watson on the front foot, looking assured for now but not too threatening. 22nd over: Australia 90-1 (target: 297; Watson 33, Ponting 47) Davids Gahr and Lloyd in the box for the last half hour. Should be fun. Swann bowling to Watson and being turned to the deep fielders with the spin. Ponting follows suit with a pair of shorter balls. \"We're going to win 4-0,\" sing the gleeful Barmies. Hmm. 23rd over: Australia 99-1 (target: 297; Watson 35, Ponting 49) Kevin Pietersen is having a bowl now and drops the first ball horribly short and KP gets a taste of his own medicine with overthrows from Finn that hit the helmet and cost him an extra five. His last ball grips and rips but he's been very short this over. Two overs left if they agree to call it a day. 24th over: Australia 105-1 (target: 297; Watson 40, Ponting 50) Ponting takes a single to get to 50 and then Watson creams an ondrive for four. Useful stuff from the Australians, no psychological scars and refusing to let Swann settle. Here's KAt Petersen: \"Suggestion for Neil Gouldson (21st over): I've found an easy way to explain cricket related happiness/despair with as little language as possible is to pretend the score works as in football. Point to the 517 and say \"England\" (ying guo), point to the 1 and say \"Australia\". They will understand.\" 25th over: Australia 107-1 (target: 297; Watson 41, Ponting 51) Pietersen again, better length this over. Perhaps having spent 11 hours padded up he needed to get the lethargy out of his legs. And both captains shake hands and that's it. England have drawn the first Test at the Gabba for the first time since 1998 and this time they didn't need the rain. An excellent second innings in every respect, all batted brilliantly with Strauss setting the tone and Cook and Trott turning the screw. That was a valuable bit of confident batting from Watson and Ponting, though, and several of you have suggested that the declaration was unnecessary and gave Australia the opportunity to dent Swann's fortitude. I'm on the side that it had to be done and if Collingwood had held that catch it would have been beneficial to see if Clarke really is fit. Anyway, a fine, absorbing Test. No, it was better than that. It was a simply gobsmacking fightback from England. They were said to need a Houdini act but it was far, far better than escapology. It was a counter-attack of real character and courage. It's going to be a great series. Join Andy and Rob on Thursday night. Thanks for all your emails. Good morning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
