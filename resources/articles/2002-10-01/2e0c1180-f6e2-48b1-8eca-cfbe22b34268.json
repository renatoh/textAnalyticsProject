Deep unease was expressed yesterday after it was revealed that the Barclays were among six bidders to make it through to the next round in the battle for the prized titles, which are currently owned by the Scottish Media Group organisation - renamed smg in 2000. Members of the Scottish Parliament's cross-party group on media and culture and journalists' representatives said they would be doing everything possible to ensure the matter was referred to the Competition Commission. The Barclay twins, Sir Frederick and Sir David, are understood to have made a \u00a3220 million bid through a company called Ellerman Investments, chaired by Aidan Barclay, Sir David's son. In an apparent attempt to circumnavigate the Competition Commission, he will claim that Ellerman is a separately run company which has no connection with Neil, publisher of the Scotsman. The reclusive twins, who also own the Ritz hotel in London, are clearly in an acquisitive mood, having snapped up high street retailer Littlewoods for \u00a3750m on Friday. The Barclays' newspapers, the Scotsman, Scotland on Sunday and the Edinburgh Evening News, have made no mention of their owners' bid for the Herald titles. Other industry offers to make it into smg's final round came from Gannett, owner of USA Today and a number of titles in the south of England; the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, which owns the Aberdeen-based Press &amp; Journal; and Independent News &amp; Media, owner of the Independent, the Irish Independent and the Belfast Telegraph. Venture capitalists 3i, with former Mirror Group chief executive David Montgomery aboard and Candover, advised by ex-Regional Independent Media boss Chris Oakley, were also successful in having bids clear the first hurdle. The former Scottish Sun editor Jack Irvine, now the boss of Media House PR company, is acting as an adviser to the 3i/Montgomery bid. Assurances are being sought from the Scottish Executive and the Department of Trade and Industry that the commission will scrutinise all the industry offers. Dorothy Grace Elder, an independent MSP and award-winning journalist, said it was unthinkable that central Scotland's main broadsheet newspapers could all end up under the same ownership, and called on the Scottish Parliament to debate the sale. The National Union of Journalists' Scottish organiser, Paul Holleran, warned of a journalistic revolution should the Barclays be successful. 'This does not just impact upon journalists at the Herald , the Sunday Herald and the Evening Times,' he said. 'This is about the nature of public debate in post-devolutionary Scotland.' Recent plans to merge picture desk and magazine operations at the Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday had met with an angry reception from staff, he said. Mike Russell, the Scottish National Party's spokesman on education and culture, has lodged a motion with the Parliament stating that it was important the sale helped increase the diversity of media ownership in Scotland. A senior source at The Herald said: 'The Barclays are the nightmare scenario. The Scotsman has gone from being a great newspaper into a snarling anti-European, anti-devolutionary monolith. It would be a disaster for us all if the Herald were to join that stable.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
