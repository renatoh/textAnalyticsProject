DSG International, the electricals retailer formerly known as Dixons, jumped 8.6p to 129.5p on reports that US group Best Buy might be looking at the business. The American retailer has previously been linked with Carphone Warehouse, where it has taken a 3% stake, but dealers were by no means convinced it was interested in DSG. Meanwhile Premier Oil climbed 72p to \u00a312.40 as traders heard talk that Royal Dutch Shell, down 2p to \u00a321.05, might be running the slide rule over the company. Italy's ENI and Australia's Santos were other names in the frame, although sources close to Premier said: \"There is nothing going on at this stage that we are aware of.\" Later Shell revealed it had bought back shares for cancellation, which it would be unable to do were it in bid talks. Pubs group Mitchells &amp; Butler jumped 40.5p to 665.5p as Irish tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus revealed a 3.4% stake in the company through their Elpida Group investment fund. Kaupthing analysts said: \"A recent purchase of about 1.5m shares on October 26 took their investment from just under 3% to their current declarable holding of 3.4%. The only comment associated with this investment was that the duo viewed Mitchells as a 'value investment' with 'great potential'. \"We would echo those thoughts and reiterate our positive stance on the stock (with results due on 29 November) and our target price of 781p, which does not include any property company benefit. If we were to do so our target price would be around 900p.\" By the close the FTSE 100 index was 62.6 points higher at 6721.6, with the FTSE 250 up 186.9 points at 11,666.0. Wall Street was ahead around 60 points by the time London closed. Despite stronger-than-expected US GDP figures, the Fed did what most economists had expected and cut rates by 25 basis points. Even though the Fed cut, the prospect of a reduction on this side of the Atlantic receded after the Nationwide reported a 1.1% rise in house prices in October. This news, alongside an in-line trading statement, helped Britain's biggest housebuilder Taylor Wimpey rise 14p to 247.5p. But consumer goods group Unilever lost 27p to \u00a316.25p ahead of third quarter results today on fears of a slowdown in growth. US rival Procter &amp; Gamble has just announced its quarterly earnings will be below expectations, partly due to increased costs because of rising commodity prices. To add to Unilever's woes, its Indian division yesterday reported a higher than expected 22% fall in quarterly earnings. Concerns about a consumer slowdown also hit Reckitt Benckiser, off 26p at \u00a327.89. Supermarkets were little changed after what was seen as a benign Competition Commission report, with Tesco the major mover, up 16.25p to 488p. Elsewhere Premier Foods was 7.75p better at 225.5p as Collins Stewart upgraded to buy with a 250p target. The broker said: \"In September we wrote that there was a good story waiting to emerge from Premier, but that it might take time to emerge. While it may still be next year before the story becomes better fleshed out, the risk-reward has shifted in favour of the latter at the current valuation and we expect the market to begin to look through some of the near-term issues.\" Retailer Woolworths rose 0.75p to 21.25p after a trading update which, although it showed some caution ahead of Christmas, was no worse than expected. Recruitment group Imprint added 2.5p to 107p after rival OPD confirmed it was in talks to buy the company for a mixture of cash and shares, worth 108.6p a share. Landsbanki said: \"At long last OPD has stated that it is in advanced discussions concerning a possible recommended offer for Imprint. Crucially the Takeover Panel has granted dispensation to OPD not to have to offer 183.5p, which was the highest price it paid for its 5% stake back in June. We consider that it was crucial to Imprint's business that a quick resolution of this saga of bid or no bid was achieved, as it had been affecting staff morale and Imprint's ability to retain and recruit new consultants. This affected September's trading - hence the recent profit warning. \"We recommend Imprint shareholders accept any offer that results in an exit price of around 105p.\" But dry cleaning and workwear business Johnson Service slumped 66.25p to 146.5p after a profit warning. This year's figures will be hit by problems at three non-core businesses, which it wants to sell. On top of that, chief executive Charles Skinner said market forecasts of 32p of earnings for 2008 were too ambitious, given a lack of past investment in its operations. He added that Johnson needed to change its financial structure. Finally Umbro slipped 2.75p to 190.75p as doubts were raised about Nike's bid for the business after Mike Ashley's Sports Direct raised its stake in Umbro to 29.9%. Sports Direct added 8.75p to 144.25p. nick.fletcher@theguardian.com Out of controls? Engineering group Invensys added 17.5 to 327p yesterday as it sold its APV division for \u00a3250m to US manufacturer SPX Corporation. Analysts believe its controls business could be next on the block, which would put it in a good position to make a \u00a31.5bn acquisition of its own. Harry Philips of Evolution Securities said: \"Invensys is transforming itself into a pure infrastructure play based around process automation and rail. The next stage will be the exit, whether as a whole or in parts, from controls, and this will leave the company with a cash position of between \u00a3900m and \u00a31bn. While the credit crunch has seen private equity disappear momentarily from the possibilities, the fact that a trade buyer has popped up for APV demonstrates there is a bigger world out there.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
