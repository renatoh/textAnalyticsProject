With three games remaining, Nottinghamshire are one of only two teams with realistic hopes of reeling in the leaders. As they play Warwickshire in two of those matches, their fate is largely in their own hands but failure to beat the Bears in Birmingham would reduce their hopes to a sliver. This match will take a lot of winning by Chris Read's side after their seamers made only sporadic inroads on a good batting track on the first day. Warwickshire closed on 298 for five after winning a crucial toss which gave their batsmen the chance to shape the match and their bowlers some important further rest after getting home from a CB40 game in Scarborough at 12.30am. While never completely dominant, enough of their batsmen contributed to build a strong position. With rain expected to take time out of the game on Wednesday, Warwickshire would be dismayed to lose from this position. Sentenced to bowl first a good batting track, Nottinghamshire were happy enough to collect two wickets before lunch but Ian Westwood, with 81 (164 balls, 11 fours), and Jim Troughton (40, 64 balls) prevented a collapse by adding 83 in 22 overs for the third wicket. Paul Franks removed both in an impressive burst from the City End. Armed with a ball more than 50 overs old, Franks deviated it enough to dismiss two well-entrenched batsmen and, at 178 for four, leave the game finely balanced. Nottinghamshire scented an opportunity but the former England pair Tim Ambrose and Rikki Clarke make up an experienced mid-order engine room and they rebuilt with a measured alliance of 102 in 30 overs. The latter (47, 93 balls) edged a steepling delivery from Luke Fletcher with the new ball but Ambrose, whose form this season and last is close to that which forced him into the England team a few years ago, saw it through to the close. He followed his brilliant 87 in the rain and gloom of Scarborough the day before with a fluent unbeaten 64 (109 balls, 11 fours) and has power to add on Wednesday when Warwickshire will strive to bat the opposition out of the game \u2013 and the title race. Nottinghamshire must strike early. Elsewhere in Division One, Lancashire's relegation trouble looked to be deepening when they slumped to 11 for four against Durham at Liverpool. Tom Smith (86, 177 balls), with support from Gareth Cross and Kyle Hogg, led a recovery to 221 for six by the close which will give their bowlers something to work with. With the leaders Warwickshire to play next week, struggling Worcestershire badly need to beat Middlesex at New Road in the current game and Daryl Mitchell's century kept them afloat on Tuesday. The captain batted through the day for 129 out of 295 for eight, defying Toby Roland-Jones, who collected another four wickets in his impressive season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
