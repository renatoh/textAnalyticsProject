I studied English and fine art at university but as a portrait painter I found that approach to art too conceptual, and when I started a career in PR I let the painting slide. These days I work as a manager at a big London-based PR company called Rain Communications Ltd. I look after and promote clients from the retail, consumer and business sectors and much of my time is spent writing press releases, speaking to journalists and overseeing my team. It's a great job and, in its own way, pretty creative. But when, about two years ago, a colleague asked me to do her portrait I realised just how much I'd missed painting. I took a few classes, things snowballed and these days I spend most of my free time in front of an easel. I love working with oil on canvas, but I'll do pencil or charcoal sketches, too. And although I can work from photos I prefer to have someone in front of me as it's much easier to gauge skin tones and mannerisms. If it's someone I haven't painted before I'll go out with them a few times to get a better sense of their personality because how my sitter responds is defi nitely refl ected in my work. If they're laidback my brush strokes are long and relaxed. If they're nervous that shows, too. I paint from a rented room near my home and sometimes I show at open studio events where all the studios in a certain area will open their doors to the public. This year I'll be entering the National Portrait Gallery's BP Portrait Awards so right now my major task is to find a suitable sitter. When I'm painting it takes over my mind like nothing else - I can be at it for hours and then suddenly realise that I haven't eaten, the light's going and my back's hurting. And that just makes me love it even more! www.faceportrait.co.uk \u00b7 Caroline Wade was talking to Maia Adams"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
