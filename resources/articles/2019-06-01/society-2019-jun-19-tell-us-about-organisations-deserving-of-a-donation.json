Alongside the Schwarzman Centre for the Humanities, an Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence will be built to ensure that such powerful technologies are used \u2018to the benefit of society\u2019 not its detriment. Share your thoughts Do you think the money could have been spent in other ways, such as scholarship and bursary schemes? Could such a large sum be better used outside of academia, for example by charitable organisations or environmentalist projects? Do you know of local groups or little known organisations close to your heart that deserve a similar donation? How would it be valuable for them?
