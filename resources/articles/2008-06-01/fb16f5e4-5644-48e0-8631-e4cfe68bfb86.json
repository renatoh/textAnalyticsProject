So will the chair of governors. So will the student union president. The vice-chancellor, one of her deputies and one of her pro- vice-chancellors already are. Down the road 50 miles, at the University of Winchester, the chancellor, vice-chancellor, assistant vice-chancellor and two out of three deans are women. Travel 100 miles back up the road, to the University of Northampton, and the vice-chancellor, director of finance, registrar and chair of the governing council will, from September, all be women, too. Hang on, wasn't higher education thought to have been left behind when gender equality at work took off? Weren't women who \"showed potential\" given roles in teaching or learning, leaving the men in charge of resources, research and running the whole show? After all, 38% of academics with a permanent contract are women, but just 14% of UK vice-chancellors - 19 at present - are women. And the proportion of women increases the lower the grade you go. At professor level, 19% are female, according to the latest figures for 2005-06 from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce). At researcher and senior lecturer grade, 32% are women. At lecturer level, 47% are. Education Guardian's poll of 110 UK universities found that only 17 had female chancellors. In a study on pro-vice-chancellors, a rank just below deputy vice-chancellor, the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education last October reported: \"There is an extensive gender imbalance.\" But while higher education may still be thought of as trailing behind other sectors as far as gender equality goes, it is catching up, as Northampton, Oxford Brookes and Winchester show. In 2006, 42% of senior management posts in UK universities were held by women, while in 2003, 28% were, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency. It might not be by much, but the percentage of professors who are female has also nudged ahead from 15% in 2003 to 17.5% in 2006. And it is the new universities, in particular the post-92s such as Oxford Brookes, that are leading the change. How have they done it? \"Women typically wait until they have more papers published than Dickens before they apply for a professorship, while men have a go,\" says Professor Janet Beer, vice-chancellor of Oxford Brookes. \"We've changed this by developing a culture in which people, regardless of gender and ethnicity, feel they can put themselves forward for leadership positions.\" Brookes encourages flexible working, career breaks, and offers maternity and paternity leave that is more generous than usual. It has paid off. The university is soon to have a predominantly female top team, with Beer as vice-chancellor; Shami Chakrabarti, director of the civil rights pressure group Liberty, as its new chancellor; a new chair of governors, the Oxfordshire county council chief executive, Joanna Simons; and a new student union president, Lina Mughal. A pro- vice-chancellor and deputy vice-chancellor are also female. This leaves just two out of five senior management posts occupied by men - a deputy vice-chancellor and a pro- vice-chancellor. Critical mass Simonetta Manfredi, co-director of Brookes's centre for diversity policy research and practice, says this \"critical mass\" of women in senior management posts is vital if a university wants to encourage women to apply for top roles. \"Women are aware of gender differences that can act as barriers to career progression,\" she says. \"In many cases, they have experienced these challenges themselves and are committed to keeping gender equality high on the agenda.\" It is equally important, though, that men in senior management understand and champion gender equality too, she says. Brookes offers workshops with heads of academic departments on barriers women might face in their careers. Ann Tate, vice-chancellor of Northampton University, puts the newer universities' success down to a \"clearer management career structure\". \"Many of the older universities operate a rotating basis where an academic is elected to do three or four years in a position of management. The people who come forward tend to be clones of those who went before,\" she says. \"The modern universities are much more assiduous at defining management talent.\" Professor Robin Middlehurst, director of strategy, research and international activities for the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, advises universities to openly advertise for posts, rather than just use headhunters or nomination committees, if they want to encourage more women to apply. But when doing so, she cautions against wording a job spec in a way that leads people to believe the successful candidate will need to \"walk on water\". \"Sometimes, you get the impression a single individual is expected to achieve such and such, when it's actually that person and their team. \"Universities should also encourage people to apply even if they think they don't fit all the criteria or have all the experience desired,\" she says. This works, says Tate. \"Many women see an advert and think, 'I can do only nine out of 10 of the things they're asking, so I won't apply.' Men see one of the 10 they can do and think to themselves, 'I'll have a go.'\" We have got to stop telling women that they need to be 10 times better than men to get on, says Chakrabarti. \"It's not true. Getting on can be the confidence to ask questions, to network and to delegate.\" Not everyone agrees. \"We do have to be better than men,\" argues Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union. \"In an objective world this wouldn't be the case. But career patterns show otherwise. \"Promotion can often be linked to a good research record. Women might have to take time off to have children and for childcare. There is a chunk of time when their male peers are getting on.\" Hunt congratulates Brookes, Winchester and Northampton for setting women and other universities good examples. But examples alone won't be enough to achieve gender parity, she says. Hunt wants every university to have a mandatory equality audit. Hefce says that if universities are to have these audits or equality targets, they must be set by the institutions themselves. By 2010-11, Hefce says it wants to have \"increased the proportion of women, disabled people and people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds in senior posts at universities\". It is no wonder it won't be more specific than that. Some universities have a long way to go. Sheffield University has just appointed nine academics to its executive board; just two are women."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
