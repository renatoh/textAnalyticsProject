These events can be exacting for the politicians and extremely dramatic, with a lot of noisy input from the audience. The one held at the Central Methodist Hall during the 2008 London mayoral campaign was one of highlights of that contest. These assemblies aren't debates, but more like Citizens rallies with each politician asked to agree to a set of commitments. In this case there will be six: a working relationship with Telco; encouraging leading private sector employers in the borough to pay the London Living Wage; paying for CRB checks for businesses that want to become City Safe Havens; providing 1,000 work experience placements with the Council annually; supporting Community Land Trusts as a means of delivering affordable housing. The event comes as the candidates begin laying out their campaign themes and policies. I can now report with more authority on Labour's, thanks to a reader who attended Saturday's Labour Party rally for Helal Abbas kindly sending me an audio recording of the speeches. London Assembly member John Biggs - who some think should have been the one to replace Lutfur Rahman following his removal by the National Executive Committee, given that he came second in the selection ballot - acknowledged that it had been \"a difficult process\" but stressed that \"the Labour Party doesn't exist for us, the members. The Labour Party exists to serve the interests of the people of our country and the community\" - a clear snipe at the Rahman campaign, which is making an issue of the local membership's choice being over-ruled. Biggs called for \"a single voice\" to argue against the Coalition's cuts and paid tribute to Abbas, saying that he'd \"never wavered\" in his support for the Labour Party despite setbacks in his career. Then came Rushanara Ali, the newly-elected MP for Bethnal Green and Bow. She congratulated the membership for \"not tolerating intolerance\" whether from \"the far right or the far left - the Respect Party. You said goodbye to George Galloway [in May]. You said, we don't want division here, we don't want this community turned against each other - black against white against Asian; men against women; father against daughter; son against mother. That's what George Galloway's legacy has been.\" But she added: \"Unfortunately, the Respect Party is not dead yet. It's rearing its ugly head again in a new way. It's calling itself 'independent'.\" This got a loud cheer. \"It's not the same as Ken Livingstone becoming an independent,\" she continued. \"Don't flatter them.\" She urged her audience to impress upon voters that the choice of who took care of a billion pound budget was between Labour, \"a mainstream political party\" that wants to unite the borough's different communities, and a divisive group of people who, among other things, want to \"hijack Islam for selfish motives.\" She warned against intimidation and provocation and paid tribute to older Labour politicians who'd fought against the far right in her youth. Jim Fitzpatrick MP spoke next, echoing many of her sentiments and describing Abbas as \"the unity candidate.\" Abbas spoke last. He made a strong personal statement: \"I'm proud to be a Muslim and proud to be a Bangladeshi, and I would not at any time insult Islam or leaders of any other faith. The current, disgraceful scaremongering going round within the Muslim community that I have apparently insulted the imam of Mecca is totally, totally untrue.\" Here, I think, a taste of the distinctive character of Tower Hamlets politics at this point in its extraordinary history. Abbas went on to pledge to fight for better housing and safer streets. He urged activists to persuade non-Labour voters to support him. The message of the rally seemed pretty clear: Labour sees Lutfur Rahman as the man Tower Hamlets must join together to beat and every voter must be told that only the Labour candidate can beat him. Coming soon: an interview with Liberal Democrat candidate John Griffiths. Before that, you can read Griffiths's account of why he wants to be mayor here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
