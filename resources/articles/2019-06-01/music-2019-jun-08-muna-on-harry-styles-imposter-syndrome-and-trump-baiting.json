All-night drug binge? Alcohol-fuelled rampage? A nice holiday somewhere with a pool? Well, if you\u2019re emo-pop trio Muna, AKA Katie Gavin, Josette Maskin and Naomi McPherson, you go for something a little more holistic. \u201cWe\u2019re getting massages tonight to celebrate the fact that we\u2019re done and to decompress a little bit,\u201d says McPherson on an occasionally hard-to-follow three-way conference call from Los Angeles that often carries the incense-coated whiff of group therapy. Muna, it turns out, deserve that well-earned R&amp;R. Their new single, Number One Fan \u2013 the first to be taken from the forthcoming Saves the World album \u2013 may swap the indie-leaning goth-pop of 2017\u2019s About U in favour of 80s Madonna-meets-Carly Rae Jepsen kitsch, but it\u2019s a glittering Trojan horse hiding a song about struggling to find your self-worth when the external adulation suddenly stops. \u201cNo matter how many times someone tells you you\u2019re amazing, you have to learn to believe that yourself,\u201d says McPherson. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when you come home [from touring] and you\u2019re like: \u2018Well I knew I was a piece of shit and this proves it!\u2019 It\u2019s easy to get depressed.\u201d Gone too is the all-black Matrix cosplay look of that first album, replaced by a softer mix of My So-Called Life and Monica from Friends, all high-waisted mom jeans and vest tops. While it may seem like a simple case of \u201cnew era, new look\u201d, the band\u2019s singer and lyricist Gavin insists it\u2019s a much fairer reflection of who they actually are this time around. \u201cThis is what we do everyday and we just want to wear our everyday clothes,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to dress it up any more because what we do is cool enough.\u201d For perpetual over-thinker Gavin, who has a habit of ending her sentences with \u201cif that makes any sense\u201d, it\u2019s partly about letting her defences down. \u201cI loved my old haircut but I think it did a lot of work in terms of protecting me,\u201d she says of her previous \u2019do, which involved a blunt fringe, pointed \u201cbangs\u201d and a severe undercut. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t had that as a natural defence and a way of keeping people from seeing into me, I don\u2019t know if I would have been able to handle the amount of attention.\u201d While About U didn\u2019t exactly make Muna household names, it pushed them into the public eye as a queer and deeply politicised pop act at a time when that still felt out of the ordinary. During one memorable Jimmy Kimmel performance of the album\u2019s totemic single I Know a Place \u2013 transformed into an anthem of resistance following the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting \u2013 Gavin changed the lyrics in the song\u2019s middle eight to include the line \u201che\u2019s not my leader even if he\u2019s my president\u201d, with the band having previously sported homemade \u201cFuck Trump\u201d T-shirts. Their willingness to be outspoken, mixed with their sexual identity, leads to them repeatedly being asked for quotes on topics that could weigh down lesser bands. \u201cIt\u2019s validating that people care about our brains and not just our beauty,\u201d laughs Gavin, before turning deadly serious. \u201cI think there were times on the first album where we all struggled with imposter syndrome in our own way. Sometimes you would feel like a politician because you\u2019re preaching certain principles when you\u2019re speaking publicly, and then you\u2019re having these failures in your private life where you\u2019re not living out those values.\u201d Touring with silk-suited Mick Jagger impersonator Harry Styles in 2017 offered another opportunity for the band to feel as if they had stumbled into a world they weren\u2019t quite ready for. \u201cThat was the height of imposter syndrome, like: \u2018Harry Styles is in my green room, what is going on?\u2019\u201d laughs McPherson. \u201cJust full body disassociation.\u201d We talk about Styles\u2019s own queering of the mainstream, which led to criticism from some as \u201cgay-baiting\u201d, and also the idea of queerness in general being subsumed into the mainstream. \u201cIf it gets absorbed then at least its in there,\u201d says Maskin. \u201cI would rather different performances of gender or different performances of sexuality be normalised. Growing up and feeling different was not a very pleasant experience and at least [now] kids can grow up thinking: \u2018It\u2019s OK to be whatever I am.\u2019\u201d There\u2019s a ripple of agreement down the line. \u201cI can be gay as fuck and really do anything I want and exist and have a life where I can love and be happy,\u201d she continues. \u201cThings will get better because we will continue to push forward and we\u2019re resilient. We\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer.\u201d It was after the Styles tour, and the imposing silence of being back home, that they rushed into writing what would become album two. It was tricky at first. \u201cI don\u2019t think we allowed ourselves the opportunity to change and grow as musicians,\u201d sighs Maskin. Six months in, Number One Fan came along and kickstarted a newfound creative bravery. \u201cIt started out being a bit more brooding and then it shifted into the electro club banger that it is today because we decided not to get in the way of what the song wanted to be,\u201d explains McPherson, who co-produced the album. Was it always going to be the lead single? \u201cI think if it was an album track it would be the weirdest thing,\u201d she continues. Gavin, meanwhile, is more graphic, conjuring up images of crowning vaginas. \u201cIt\u2019s the head of the baby, basically,\u201d she says before collapsing into hysterics. A lot of Gavin\u2019s lyrics were written following a period of \u201cheartbreak and withdrawal\u201d, during which time she purposefully steered clear of romantic relationships, with one song, the near six-minute-long It\u2019s Gonna Be Okay, Baby, a latter period Alanis-esque journal-entry-as-song, touching on communism, suicide and home haircuts (\u201cwith those scissors from the desk in your dorm room\u201d). \u201cShit just gets weird when you realise the person you\u2019re in love with is a symbol of the type of love you\u2019re not willing to give yourself,\u201d Gavin says, apparently warming to the Morissette connection. On paper, Muna sound as if they\u2019re high on LA\u2019s finest Kool Aid. In fact, one comment from Gavin about the dangers of living in a bubble features the words \u201cseedling stage\u201d, \u201cunmet needs\u201d and \u201cnutrients\u201d. But their infectious friendship-as-therapy mannerisms mixed with an earnestness that creeps under your skin means at one point I find myself asking: \u201cAre you still hopeful about America?\u201d It is a ridiculous question but it\u2019s testament to their big ideas that they don\u2019t flinch. \u201cI have to have some degree of hope or what\u2019s the point?\u201d says McPherson. \u201cWe have hope for the world,\u201d Gavin continues. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can speak to the future of the nation but that\u2019s also because there\u2019s a question mark around the concept of nations and borders, but I think on this record we\u2019re saying we have hope for humanity.\u201d The album title, Maskin says, represents the fact that they \u201cdo genuinely believe that saving yourself is the key to saving the world\u201d. Cynicism takes over, however, when I question how they can sustain so much faith when, let\u2019s be honest, a lot of people are awful. There\u2019s silence. \u201cWow, you\u2019re that bitch!\u201d laughs Gavin, proving, perhaps, that some people can\u2019t be saved.
