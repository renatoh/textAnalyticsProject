If you drank beer, beat people up and urinated down your mate's leg on the terraces at half time, you were one of the lads. If you wore expensive designer woollens, drank wine and ate olives, you were gay and had got lost on the way to a West End show. These days, since football got gentrified and everyone turned a bit middle class, the lines have blurred. At Chelsea on a Saturday, they can't move for actors, writers and choreographers, who cram into Stamford Bridge cheek by jowl to watch the Premiership champions. Before the game, they meet up at SW3's gastropubs and bistros to share bruschetta and petit chablis. Some of them might be gay; the majority aren't. But they engage in a lifestyle that old-fashioned football fans would have associated with being homosexual. Stonewall is encouraging football clubs to employ more gay people and give out a more inclusive, welcoming message to the gay community. Manchester City are the first to sign up to the Diversity Champions scheme. There's no better club to have got the ball rolling: their fans packed the stadium even when the team got relegated two divisions a few years ago. They're as tough, loud and passionate as they come. If anyone can laugh off the inevitable gay taunts that will come their way over the next weeks, it's them. Will their efforts help to entice more gay people to football matches? That doesn't really matter. For a start, there are plenty of gay football fans as it is: the Gay Football Supporters' Network is a national body set up to represent them. The country's most famous gay football fan, Matt Lucas, does a great deal to challenge stereotypes (unlike the previous incumbent in this role, the flamboyantly bewigged Elton John). The majority of football fans these days consider themselves tolerant, liberal-minded blokes. But they sing the odd illiberal chant in the spirit of intimidating opposition players and maximising their side's chances of winning. Almost no topic is taboo in pursuit of this aim, and there's a certain amount of mischief involved. Throwing gay taunts from the stands at a self-important, straight player like Sol Campbell may have more impact on his game than it would on a genuinely gay man. Where's the fun in saying to someone, \"You're gay!\" if they can turn round and respond, \"You're quite right! I am! As gay as a baby goose! Rock on!\" Still, the message from Man City and Stonewall is that, however ironic you think you're being, chanting homophobic songs doesn't tally with being a self-proclaimed liberal. Football is an integral part of our national culture: if it is permeated by casual homophobia, what does that say about our society? Racism was slowly but surely driven out of the game by clubs espousing a zero-tolerance policy. Now the same can be done with homophobia. The game doesn't necessarily need more gay fans and gay people don't necessarily need more football. But society needs more clubs like City to make this sort of progressive gesture. \u00b7 Sam Delaney supports West Ham"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
