We are cut off from one another, and from our homes, Haraway says, by the alienating effects of technology and capitalism. Haraway\u2019s belief is that, as Day parses it (in rather more readable prose than the original), \u201clife\u2026 is a communal endeavour: we are not islands, but archipelagos\u201d. This sense that we as a species have been collectively uprooted might explain why the nature memoir as vehicle for self-revelation has become such a staple of our literary landscape. The new nature writing, which is at its best in the work of Helen Macdonald, Richard Mabey and Kathleen Jamie, often seeks to present a return to nature as a curative to the psychological and existential ills of modernity. Day\u2019s book is ostensibly about his time as a novice pigeon racer, his initiation into the strange cult of the fancier, with its obscure rites and nomenclature, its frantic races and sometimes cruel manipulations of the pigeons\u2019 lives. But, like so many books in this genre, its surface subject hides a host of subterranean obsessions. As Day himself suggests at the end, Homing is an anti-travel book, a book about the places we call home, and how our ideas of home have changed over the centuries. It\u2019s also about masculinity and fatherhood, about love and solitude, about why we are drawn to creatures with whom we are unable to communicate, whose lives are lived in a different medium to our own. Homing is structured as twin narratives, one charting the home-building of Day and his wife Natalya in east London, the arrival of baby Dora, then Ivo. Day\u2019s construction of his pigeon loft and the purchase of Eggy and Orange, his first pigeons (named by Dora), are described in careful, elegant prose. The parallels between human and bird life never feel laboured, and there are numerous passages startling for their insight and emotional honesty. These domestic chapters are intercut with shorter, more fanciful sections, in which Day recreates an epic race that his birds undertake from Thurso in the north of Scotland back to London. These are literal flights of imagination, in which Day seeks to slough off human consciousness, to enter as fully as possible the arduous existence of the pigeons he has come to love. Day is an English lecturer, a former Man Booker judge, and the author of an excellent memoir of his time as a cycle courier. Homing is a highly literary book, dense with quotes from the likes of Sebald and Solnit, Perec and Henry Green. That Day\u2019s own prose does not feel out of place amid such exalted company gives you an idea of what a very good book this is. \u2022 Homing: On Pigeons, Dwellings and Why We Return by Jon Day is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (\u00a316.99).
