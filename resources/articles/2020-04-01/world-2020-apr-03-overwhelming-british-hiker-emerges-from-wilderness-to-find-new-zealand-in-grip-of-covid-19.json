So when British hiker James Johnston emerged from the bush after five days solo-tramping on the off-piste Five Passes route, a prickly feeling ran up his spine when he found an abandoned Routeburn shelter. \u201cThere are almost always lots of people there, it\u2019s one of the most popular walks in the country,\u201d said Johnston, 27, who has lived in New Zealand for two years. \u201cI saw the whole place was deserted, not a single car or person anywhere, which was weird. \u201cThe fact that this incredibly popular spot in a popular month of the year was empty \u2013 it was a bit spooky.\u201d Johnston had entered the bush when there were still only a handful of coronavirus cases in New Zealand, and the newly introduced alert system was at two \u2013 \u201creduce contact\u201d. Solo-tramping on a remote mountain range seemed the ideal way to reduce contact, Johnston thought, and headed off, largely unconcerned. Over his five days tramping he didn\u2019t see a soul, and his phone had no reception. The trip, Johnston says, was \u201cspecial\u201d \u2013 tons of birdlife and challenging terrain. But when he descended the Sugarloaf track last Thursday \u2013 the first day of nationwide lockdown \u2013 he was tired, and ready for some creature comforts. Finding the Routeburn shelter deserted, Johnston says an \u201ceerie\u201d feeling began creeping over him, as he sat down to eat his lunch and plan the next move. There being no cars around to give him a ride back to Queenstown, some 70km away. Suddenly, three people emerged through the heavy downpour, dressed in high-vis and wearing face masks. \u201cThey were surprised to see me, and I was very surprised to them as well,\u201d says Johnston. \u201cI asked if they could give me a ride, and they said \u201c\u2018absolutely not \u2013 we\u2019re not allowed to take anyone in the car.\u2019\u201d In a rush, the story unfolded. The whole country had been placed in level four lockdown, with domestic travel banned and everyone confined to their homes. Later, Johnston found out one of his rescuers was infected with coronavirus. Johnston told the trio \u2013 tasked with clearing the back-country for civil defence \u2013 that he needed to get back to Wellington. He was told he\u2019d have to lockdown in Queenstown instead, probably in a tent, at a remote campsite \u201cfor a month, or more\u201d. \u201cI was reeling,\u201d Johnston says. \u201cTo have three strangers jabbering to you about the end of the world; it was overwhelming.\u201d The trio decided they couldn\u2019t leave Johnston to walk back to Queenstown and decided to take the risk of taking him in the car \u2013 directly to the airport for a flight out, after the government announced a short grace period to allow people to get home. \u201cAs soon as I had signal on my phone I had 200 messages from people saying \u201cyou need to get out, right now, because the country is going into lockdown\u201d. I hadn\u2019t received any of them,\u201d says Johnston. \u201cWe start bombing along the road. There were no cars except police cars. There were no people anywhere. It was very spooky. The whole trip felt like Black Mirror. They kept saying \u201c\u2018oh have you heard what\u2019s happened in China? America is absolutely fucked. You know this whole thing is spreading?\u2019\u201d Johnston \u2013 still covered in mud and sweat from his hike \u2013 caught his flight with just six other passengers and is now in self-isolation with four flatmates in Wellington. He intends to stay in New Zealand, with the peaceful memories of his last tramping trip to sustain him through the months of captivity ahead. \u201cI had sort of wondered, out of curiosity, what will the world look like when I come back?\u201d Johnston says. \u201cI didn\u2019t imagine anything as unusual as this.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
