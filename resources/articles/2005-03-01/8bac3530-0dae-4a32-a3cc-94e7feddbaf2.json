Jack High, trained by Walsh's father Ted, was caught close home after appearing to have taken a decisive advantage at the second-last. Winning trainer Martin Brassil said: \"He is only really a novice, but he is a sound jumper and always gets himself out of trouble when he has to. The horse has done more than we expected, so he deserves a break and could come back next year, although faster ground would not suit.\" Jack High and third-placed Marcus Du Berlais were both cut in the betting for the John Smith's Grand National on Saturday week, with William Hill trimming the former to 25-1, while the latter is now a 33-1 shot"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
