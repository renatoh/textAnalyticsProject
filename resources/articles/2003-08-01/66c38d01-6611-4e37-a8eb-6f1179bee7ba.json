He joined the then Regent Street Polytechnic (now the University of Westminster) in 1969 to teach psychology, and to take part in setting up a diploma in communication studies. In 1975, this was upgraded to an honours degree in media studies - the first, and for some years the only, undergraduate course on this topic in Britain. There was little in the way of academic literature to go on when it came to teaching the course, and staff had to do much of the background research themselves. David and I began our systematic investigation into the prewar BBC because we wanted to know about the origins of radio documentary for a course that we had rashly offered to teach. The work grew into a large-scale study of policy and programme-making in all the major areas of radio output: news, features, talks, music, outside broadcasts and entertainment. It was eventually published in 1991 as A Social History Of British Broadcasting, 1922-1939. David's meticulously researched studies of the BBC Talks and Variety departments in the 1930s made a fundamental contribution to the understanding of the development of broadcast talk and entertainment. In the 1980s he published a number of articles on these topics in the journal Media Culture &amp; Society and elsewhere. Educated at Eton, David went to New College, Oxford (1963-66), where he read politics, philosophy and psychology. Why he chose these subjects is something of a mystery, since he was always far more interested in the arts and literature. Nevertheless, he succeeded in astonishing successive intakes of students with his lectures, accompanied by diagrams, on the relevance of Hegel to their understanding of contemporary media. These were counterbalanced by vivid accounts of experiments in authoritarian behaviour which seemed to prove that students would willingly inflict life-threatening pain on each other, when prompted to do so by academic psychologists. He was course leader of the BA in media studies for a number of years. Later, he played an important role in Westminster, chairing many validation panels of existing and new degree courses across the university. Though he found paperwork irksome, he applied himself to it patiently because he was concerned to maintain high standards and to ensure that students received a good education. Students loved him. It was not just that he was a dedicated and entertaining teacher - he was actually interested in them and their lives and was a good and patient listener. He will be remembered by a whole generation of young people whom he taught. His colleagues will miss him too. He was always good company; a notable raconteur and singer of music hall ballads. In the annual Christmas show, put together on video by the television students, he was always the star turn. His performances as Madonna (Material Girl) and Boy George (Karma Chameleon) were legendary. David took early retirement in 1996. After more than 25 years he was tired of teaching, a subject which seemed to him by then to be in the intellectual doldrums, and he did not like the emerging audit culture of performance indicators and paper trails in higher education. He left Westminster without regret, eager to devote himself to his lifelong passion for painting. He set up in studios, first at Hackney, then in High Barnet, and worked all day improving his technique and discovering his own style and \"voice\". Whenever he met his former colleagues he would say, quite simply, that he had never been happier in his life. An exhibition of his work will be held in the autumn. Earlier this year he was diagnosed as having myelo-fibrosis, and advised that he needed a bone-marrow transplant. His brother, Charles, was the donor. David died of a stroke three days after the operation. He is survived by his wife, the journalist Lynn Barber, whom he married in 1971, and their two children, his father and two brothers. \u00b7 David Maurice Cloudesly Cardiff, broadcasting historian and painter, born June 1 1944; died August 10 2003"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
