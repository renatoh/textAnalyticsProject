He was not a success. His first training session had Jim Smith, then the Birmingham manager, asking anxiously \"What's the Spanish for 'run'?\" Tarantini lasted less than a season at St Andrew's. Alex McLeish is having better luck with another Argentinian, Mauro Z\u00e1rate. The 21-year-old striker, signed on loan from Al-Sadd of Qatar, could prove to be the catalyst in keeping Birmingham in the Premier League. Z\u00e1rate's fourth goal in four games brought Birmingham a point on Saturday after Everton, under pressure for much of the second half, had threatened to steal a win against the run of play. The free-kick with which Z\u00e1rate beat Tim Howard seven minutes from the end came straight from the David Beckham school of dramatic art. The ball was curled over Everton's lofty wall and found the top left-hand corner of the net. \"I saw a congregation gathering around the ball and I know that at a given moment a few people fancy themselves to pop it over the wall and into the top corner,\" McLeish said. \"But it very rarely happens and I made sure David Murphy got word that I wanted Z\u00e1rate to take the kick. I had seen him on DVDs doing this.\" Events will show whether the point Birmingham thereby gained turns out to be more important than the two they dropped. With Bolton and Fulham both winning, McLeish's side are now only two points above the bottom three, albeit with a superior goal difference, and their four remaining fixtures will demand a greater degree of consistency than they have achieved so far. Z\u00e1rate has brought fresh dash and incisiveness to an attack which for much of the season has trundled along impotently, much as it did when Steve Bruce's side were relegated two years ago. Yet the Argentinian was starting matches only because of an injury to James McFadden and on Saturday the Scot's return to fitness found Z\u00e1rate back on the bench, replacing McFadden 14 minutes from the end. \"Z\u00e1rate is still learning the team game,\" McLeish explained. \"I've got to be careful I'm not throwing him in every week just for the sake of the individual skills he's got because I've already got two experienced strikers out there.\" True enough, although against Everton's tightly-knit defence both McFadden and Mikael Forssell, who was replaced at half-time with a twisted ankle, struggled for a glimpse of goal. For a side hoping to deprive Liverpool of fourth place Everton gave a strangely muted performance and afterwards their manager, David Moyes, said he would like to be able to give some of his players a breather. On Saturday Everton were workmanlike as always but seldom threatened Birmingham in the first half, and found themselves on the receiving end for much of the second. A bad miss by City's Liam Ridgewell, who hoisted the ball over from close in, and an inspired double save by Tim Howard kept the match goalless, though not for long. In the 78th minute Lee Carsley picked out Yakubu Ayegbeni with a precise short cross from the left-hand byline and the Nigerian's header was diverted past Maik Taylor by Joleon Lescott, the centre-back's ninth goal of the season. \"It was a cruel blow to go behind,\" said McLeish. At least Z\u00e1rate soothed some of the bruising."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
