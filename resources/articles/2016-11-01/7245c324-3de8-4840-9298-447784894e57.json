Documents from the Santa Monica, California, police department relating to the case were first published by Politico on Thursday, 25 August 2016. The case was eventually dismissed. \u201cShe complained of soreness to her neck,\u201d wrote a police officer who responded to the incident. \u201cI saw red marks on her left wrist and the right side of her neck. These were photographed.\u201d Police arrived at the home on New Year\u2019s Day, 1996, after a call was made to 911 and the line went dead, the police report says. The report draws on an account by Bannon\u2019s then wife, whom he had married eight months earlier, three days before she gave birth to their twins. The couple\u2019s decision to marry was described in a separate declaration filed by the woman in their divorce case, obtained by the New York Post. \u201cBannon made it clear that he would not marry me just because I was pregnant,\u201d the Post quotes the document as saying. \u201cI was scheduled for an amniocentesis and was told by the respondent that if the babies were normal we would get married \u2026 After the test showed that the babies were normal the respondent sent over a prenuptial agreement for me to review.\u201d The Trump campaign did not reply to a request for comment. Both Bannon\u2019s ex-wife and his lawyer in the domestic case declined comment to Politico. The police officer who filed the report in the domestic violence case noted that when he arrived on the scene, the woman \u201cappeared as if she was very upset and had been crying\u201d. The document continues: I saw that her eyes were red and watery. She first said, \u2018Oh, thank you, you are here. How did you know to come?\u2019 As I started to tell her about the 911 hang up call, she started to cry, and it took 3-4 minutes for her to calm down, so she could tell me what happened. The domestic dispute developed after a night in which Bannon slept on the couch, according to police documents. \u201cEarly in the morning she got up to feed their twins, and Mr Bannon got upset at her for making some noise,\u201d the document says. She asked him for the credit card to buy groceries, and he said she should write a check, the police report says. \u201cShe asked him why he was playing those games with the money, and he said it was his money.\u201d She spit on him, the document says, and then \u201che reached up to her, from the driver\u2019s seat of his car, and grabbed her left wrist. He pulled her down \u2026 Mr Bannon grabbed at her neck also pulling her into the car. She said that she started to fight back.\u201d In the divorce filing, the woman says that Bannon, who later remarried, then followed her back into the home and destroyed the phone. \u201cI took the phone to call the police and he grabbed the phone away from me throwing it across the room, and breaking it as he [was] screaming,\u201d the Post quotes the document as saying. The couple had gone to counseling earlier in their relationship after \u201cthree or four arguments that became physical\u201d, according to the police report. Bannon was charged with misdemeanor domestic violence, battery and dissuading a witness. The case was dismissed. The woman claims in the divorce filing that it was dismissed because Bannon convinced her to leave town, because \u201cif I wasn\u2019t in town they couldn\u2019t serve me and I wouldn\u2019t have to go to court\u201d. \u201cHe also told me that if I went to court he and his attorney would make sure that I would be the one who was guilty. I was told that I could go anywhere in the world.\u201d This article was originally published on 26 August 2016 and updated on 13 November 2016 after Bannon was named chief strategist for Donald Trump\u2019s White House."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
