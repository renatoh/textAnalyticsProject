But it is also a reminder of the country\u2019s addiction to plastic. The Guardian\u2019s ekiben, eaten en route to this week\u2019s G20 summit in Osaka, contained no fewer than nine individual pieces of plastic, from functional sachets for sauce and mustard to purely decorative slivers of fake grass. In the run-up to the gathering of world leaders, Japan has vowed to spearhead international efforts to tackle plastic waste \u2013 an environmental catastrophe its citizens said they wanted prioritised at the two-day meeting, which opens on Friday. But campaigners say Japan \u2013 the world\u2019s second-biggest producer of plastic waste per capita after the US \u2013 must also do more to deal with the rubbish piling up on its own doorstep. Japanese consumers get through about 30bn plastic shopping bags a year. Osaka Bay, a stone\u2019s throw from the G20 venue, contains an estimated three million plastic shopping bags and six million other pieces of plastic, according to a study by Osaka University of Commerce, cited by Bloomberg. While the European parliament passed legislation in March to ban single-use plastic in all member states by 2021, Japan, along with the US, failed to sign the G-7 plastics charter last year, which would have committed it to reuse, recycle and collect all plastic products by 2030. Instead, the government has committed itself to a less ambitious 25% reduction in single-use plastic by 2030. A cultural preference for elaborate packaging is partly to blame \u2013 consumers associate carefully wrapped items with luxury and high-end customer service. Aesthetically pleasing but unnecessary packaging in supermarkets, shops and platform bento stands, have left Japan struggling to cope. Japan once sent a 1.5m tonnes of plastic waste to China every year until Beijing banned the imports in 2017, and is now redirecting it to countries in Southeast Asia that are poorly equipped to handle and process the waste, exposing people to environmental and public health problems. Determined not to become Asia\u2019s plastic dumping ground, countries such as Malaysia and the Philippines are now turning back the shipments. As a result, plastic waste is building up in Japanese warehouses, and incinerators are at full capacity. The government will require supermarkets and other shops to charge for disposable bags from next April, a move critics said does not go nearly far enough given that many other countries have already banned plastic bags from supermarkets. The environment minister, Yoshiaki Harada, conceded the measure, which will leave retailers to set the price of a bag, would do little to address the damage single-use plastics are inflicting on the marine environment. \u201cThe proportion of plastic bags among plastic waste is not big, but charging would be symbolic,\u201d of Japan\u2019s determination to reduce plastic waste, he told reporters earlier this month. G20 environment ministers meeting in Japan earlier this month agreed on an international framework that calls on countries to take voluntary steps to reduce single-use plastics, but stopped short of setting numerical goals. \u201cMarine litter, especially marine plastic litter and microplastics, is a matter requiring urgent action given its adverse impacts on marine ecosystems, livelihoods, and industries including fisheries, tourism, and shipping, and potentially on human health,\u201d they said in a communiqu\u00e9. Local authorities and companies are taking more decisive action. The town of Kameoka, near Kyoto, will ban almost 800 retailers from handing out plastic bags from next year \u2013 with violators potentially facing fines - while the village of Kamikatsu is striving to become completely waste-free by next year. Seven-Eleven Japan said this week it will start selling onigiri rice balls in plant-based wrapping from as early as next month. The firm\u2019s 21,000 stores nationwide sell 2.2bn onigiri a year. It has said it will also replace all plastic shopping bags with paper by 2030 and all plastic packaging with paper, biodegradable or other reusable materials. Convenience store operator Family Mart now uses recycled plastic for its cold noodle range, while the Chinese restaurant chain Ohsho said it would eliminate single-use plastic straws and spoons at all of its 700-plus restaurants from next month. \u201cIndividuals taking action on single-use plastics is one thing,\u201d said Hiroaki Odachi of Greenpeace Japan. \u201cBut if more businesses took real action - ie eliminating and shifting to reusables - instead of distractions such as recyclables and biodegradeables, the impact would be much greater. But the petroleum industry has been lobbying hard against change.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
