As the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, ramps up pressure on Labor to side with the government to scrap the so-called medevac laws passed against its will in February, Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, said the party was standing firm in support. \u201cThe government has not put forward any compelling evidence as to why this legislation should be repealed,\u201d Keneally told Sky News. \u201cLabor supports the medevac laws for two reasons. It ensures when people are sick they are able to get the healthcare that they need that they cannot get on Manus and Nauru \u2026 [And] that the legislation provides for the minister to be able to determine who comes into the country. \u201cWe are not open to repealing the law in absence of any actual evidence. What I would be open to doing is, if the government has amendments that they want to put forward, [looking at them] but they have\u2019t done that.\u201d Following a federal court ruling that allows asylum seekers to be assessed by doctors remotely, Dutton said the government was seeking advice about potentially challenging the ruling by either an appeal to the full federal court, or in the high court. Following the ruling, Dutton said it would diminish the government\u2019s authority to prevent people being transferred to Australia, and called on the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, to take control of an \u201cunravelling situation\u201d. Keneally, however, pointed to government tender documents that were seeking clinical advisers to undertake desktop assessments and suggested the government was already using remote assessment. Dutton called the attack a \u201cred herring\u201d. \u201cThe debate today is about whether or not the Labor party is going to support our repealing of this dangerous law, which is a law of Labor\u2019s making,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cMr Albanese needs to take control of what is an unravelling situation for the Labor party at the moment, and he needs to come out and say whether or not they will support the government and repeal that law in parliament.\u201d He said the transferees could include people who were of bad character but did not meet the threshold outlined in the legislation. \u201cPeople of bad character can come, are able to come, and, in fact, are required to come under Labor\u2019s laws that they passed \u2013 that\u2019s the reality,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some people of bad character who have come to our country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
