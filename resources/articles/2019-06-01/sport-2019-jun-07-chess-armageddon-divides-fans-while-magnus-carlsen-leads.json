It can also lead to chaotic scrambles where pieces fall off the board, players bang down their moves and hammer the clocks, and fractions of a second decide the result. That is what happened in Tuesday\u2019s Levon Aronian v Alexander Grischuk game at Altibox Norway. The loser called it \u201camong the top three most disappointing defeats in my life\u201d. In an Armageddon game White has more thinking time on the clock than Black but a draw on the board scores as a Black win. Normally White has five or six minutes and Black four or five for the entire game but in the current Altibox Norway tournament it is 10 against seven. In response to growing complaints about too many draws the Altibox organisers made a controversial decision this year to limit classical games to four hours and to replay draws immediately as Armageddons. The scoring system is 2 points for a classical win, 1.5 for a classical draw and an Armageddon win, 0.5 for a classical draw and an Armageddon loss and 0 for a classical loss. Altibox is the annual event at Stavanger where Magnus Carlsen performs against his global rivals. Despite playing in his own backyard, Norway\u2019s world champion has won Altibox only once previously in six attempts, and has twice finished near the bottom. This year, though, Caissa is so far smiling on Carlsen, who was losing on the board and far behind on the clock against Aronian, but still managed to halve the classical game before defeating the now demoralised Armenian in Armageddon. Going into Friday\u2019s rest day after three rounds the leaders are Carlsen 5/6, Ding Liren (China), Wesley So (US) and Aronian all 4/6. Carlsen\u2019s total comes from one classical win and two Armageddon wins. The new Altibox format has triggered a fierce debate among internet viewers, with a large majority of the hundreds of comments critical of Armageddon and/or of the scoring system which downgrades classical games. However, the most hostile posts came after round one when all five games went to Armageddon including the Aronian v Grischuk shambles. In round two there were three Armageddons, and in round three only one, while the quality of the games improved. Carlsen is in favour: \u201cThere has been plenty of fight in the classical games, and having Armageddon just gives it an extra dimension. It\u2019s just extra excitement every day. I am sure there are people who like it, people who don\u2019t like it, but I think it\u2019s been very exciting so far and I look forward to the future,\u201d he said. So the Armageddon jury is still out and the arguments will continue when Altibox Norway resumes with round four (of nine) starting at 4pm on Saturday. 3622 (a) Black wins by 1...Kg3! and h5-h4-h3-h2 mate. (b) White wins by 1 f6! gxf6 2 Kxg2 Kg5 3 a4 bxa3 ep 4 bxa3 Kf5 5 a4 Ke5 6 d6! cxd6 7 c6! dxc6 8 a5 and White queens."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
