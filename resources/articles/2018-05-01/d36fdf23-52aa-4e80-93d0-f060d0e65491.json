The draw, secured courtesy of Laurent Depoitre\u2019s opening goal and some staggering defending throughout a one-sided contest, effectively condemned Swansea City to the Championship while leaving Chelsea\u2019s own hopes of securing Champions League qualification hanging by a thread. Wagner almost lost his tracksuit trousers as his players gave him the bumps in front of the delighted away fans, and then gave his squad 48 hours to celebrate their eye-catching success. \u201cThis is an absolute overachievement, bigger than the promotion last season,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year we were predicted to be relegated from the Championship and we got promoted. This season we were predicted to be a team relegated by miles, and I understand it. We work under circumstances which are not even Championship circumstances. But part of our DNA, the Huddersfield Town DNA, is to try it. To have passion, desire, spirit ... how big you are doesn\u2019t count for everything. \u201cWe did it on our own. We didn\u2019t rely on anybody else. We did it with our result, in this week with games against Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal ... it\u2019s just unbelievable. For sure Chelsea were the better team and we had Lady Luck on our side. We saw top, top quality in Chelsea\u2019s side, but we saw desire, spirit, great attitude and an unbelievable workrate on our side, and sometimes that\u2019s enough. Today was a stolen point but, to be perfectly honest, I don\u2019t care. It feels like another trophy.\u201d Asked how he planned to celebrate with the squad, Wagner replied: \u201cThe guys just said we cancelled their flight. They want to go back by coach. They have 48 hours and what they say we\u2019ll do. We\u2019ll go back by coach.\u201d All three sides promoted last May have now survived in the top division with Town, like Brighton and Newcastle, having hardly spent any time at all in the bottom three. \u201cWe were never really near the bottom, apart from one match week by goal difference, and always collected consistently points,\u201d added the German. \u201cI knew it would be tight for sure, and I never doubted my players\u2019 mental spirit. Even after five defeats in a row, we came back. Around Christmas I said if it was a final against Arsenal on the last day, I\u2019d take it. But now we can play that game with total freedom and give Ars\u00e8ne Wenger all the focus he deserves after 22 years in the Premier League.\u201d Chelsea trail Liverpool by two points, and must win at Newcastle and hope Brighton achieve an unlikely victory at Anfield to pluck a top\u2011four finish from a mishmash of a campaign. \u201cI\u2019m realistic,\u201d said Antonio Conte, whose side summoned 22 shots at goal but only scored when Mathias J\u00f8rgensen\u2019s shot cannoned in inadvertently off Marcos Alonso. \u201cAt the end of the season, you finish in the position you deserve, and we dropped too many points. It is not the first time that we have not been clinical and suffered.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
