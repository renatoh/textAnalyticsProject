Chelsea's success last season under the interim manager Guus Hiddink earned them their only trophy since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who won the Cup in 2007, had left the club. Ancelotti won the Coppa Italia four times as a player with Roma and once, in 2003, as a coach during his eight years at Milan, but placed little emphasis on the domestic cup competition with the Rossoneri. That, however, is not an option at Chelsea. \"I think that I know very well how important this competition is,\" said Ancelotti, whose side play Watford at Stamford Bridge on Sunday in the third round. \"The first thing that the club said to me is that the FA Cup is not the Italian Cup. That was one of the first things said to me. The club want to win this competition, just like the Premier League or the Champions League. It's the same. We want to do our best.\" With that in mind, the manager will pick the strongest side available to him against the Championship side, despite Chelsea's lead in the Premier League having been shaved to two points by Manchester United. His hand is weakened somewhat by the departure of a quartet of players to the African Cup of Nations, with the leading scorer Didier Drogba a key absentee. The side's form had dipped through December, with one win in seven games in all competitions before Fulham were beaten 2-1 at Stamford Bridge on Monday. Trailing to Zoltan Gera's early goal, and booed off by their own supporters at the break, Chelsea recovered their poise with Ancelotti impressed by the role played by his senior players in sparking that response. \"My players showed they are a very good team in that game,\" he said. \"That was an important moment for the team. I saw them [form a huddle] at the end of the game, and that was a good thing to have, but also in the dressing room at half-time. When a team hasn't played well, it's normal that they don't receive a clap, but a whistle [from the crowd]. It can be a good motivation for them, even if they are top of the league. The fans come to Stamford Bridge to see their team play well, and they hadn't seen good football in that first half. So it was normal, good and right to have been booed off. \"But Didier, [John] Terry and [Frank] Lampard spoke to the other players in the dressing room at half-time and made sure there was a very good atmosphere in there. I spoke about what had happened in the first half, but I was not angry. I was not upset. I just spoke about changing the system. It was the players who created that atmosphere. And I saw a fantastic reaction out on the pitch after that. I have experience of football and I know it's very difficult to change a game in the way my players did against Fulham. For me, that was a surprise. That reaction. It was fantastic: the determination, the personality. They wanted to win that game so much.\" Drogba's influence will be missed both on and off the pitch while he competes for the Ivory Coast in Angola, and it was the forward who had addressed the huddle at the final whistle on Monday. \"Drogba is not only a very good player, he's a very good man,\" Ancelotti added. \"Of course, we'll miss something with him away. He scores goals for us, and he's also a strong personality. We will have to do more than our best to make up for his absence.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
