No, seriously, I did. I surprised him, he wasn't happy about it, he chased me. But I was too quick. To be fair to the elephant, I was on a motorbike. Scary, though. I say \"he\" \u2013 it might have been a she, perhaps protecting a baby. Anyway, I think it might have been the one headbutting the Land Rover in Natural World \u2013 Sri Lanka: Elephant Island (BBC2). I recognise the look it has in its eye. It's not all Babar, you know; elephants are said to have killed 50 people in Sri Lanka last year. There are always stories in the papers there about fatal tramplings. This other one, Nimal, isn't scary at all. Well, he's only a baby, two and a half years old, and he lives at an elephant orphanage. Aaahh. Like Dickens, only with trunks. They're so lovely when they're little, hairy and playful. But Nimal doesn't play with the other elephant orphans, or can't, and when he comes out of the river, the reason becomes clear \u2013 he only has three legs. He was caught in a snare, and the orphanage people couldn't save his leg. How entirely evil, whoever set that trap. Nimal, the three-legged elephant who plays on his own and who will never be released back into the wild, is just about the saddest thing in the world. He has a prosthetic leg, but it's not very good. It keeps falling off. This film, by cameraman and elephant expert Martyn Colbeck, is an old-school wildlife documentary. There are a few birds and fish about the place (I liked that bit), but basically it's about elephants. A single species, filmed painstakingly, over time, by one bloke with a camera. In these days of high technology, concepts and themes, amazing shots, going inside things, and strapping cameras to them so they film themselves \u2013 God knows what else \u2013 it does seem a little old-fashioned. Slow, you might say. But once you've settled into the groove of it, the pace seems appropriate. Elephants are slow, mainly. Until they come at you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
