The controversial proposals - which the Lords had already rejected once, and only secured a majority of 17 in the Commons - will now gain royal assent and become law. The move to the semi-autonomous foundation hospitals, which raise their own finances, was not in the 2001 Labour election manifesto, and was bitterly opposed by former health secretary Frank Dobson, as well as many backbenchers. The health and social care (community health and standards) bill is now clear for royal assent. Announcing the eleventh-hour climbdown Earl Howe, for the Conservatives, told peers: \"An issue of this kind is essentially one of policy rather than constitutional principle. \"It is not for us to continue to resist the will of the elected house.\" The government survived a close shave in the Commons last night - a massive rebellion by 62 backbenchers, slashing Labour's huge paper majority to just 17. Later, after peers again insisted on rejecting the plans, MPs voted to restore them once more, this time with an increased margin of 41. Earl Howe accused the government of \"arm-twisting tactics\". He said there was \"real and widespread hostility\" to the trusts. But he added: \"This house was right to send an emphatic message to the government yesterday, in rejecting this part of the bill but, like it or not, the Lords have a duty to recognise the validity and strength of the decision of the Commons.\" Labour opponents fear the move will reintroduce a Tory-style internal market within the NHS, and result in hospitals moving towards quicker, or more commercial, operations. Meanwhile, although the Tories have opposed the measures, their stance comes because they say the plan does not go far enough. In an earlier debate on the bill in the summer, Labour's majority dropped to just 35. The nervousness of the government business managers ahead of Wednesday's debate was underlined when the sports minister, Richard Caborn, was brought back from Australia - missing the rugby World Cup final - to bolster the vote. Meanwhile, the traditional final day \"ping pong\" between the Commons and peers continued as the government was defeated again in the Lords today over its controversial plans to curb the right to jury trials. Peers voted 163 to 115, a majority of 49, to leave out a key clause in the criminal justice bill which gives the defendant the right to choose a trial by judge alone. The defeat is another setback for the government, which is aiming to steer the bill on to the statute book before the end of the current parliamentary session later today. The government was defeated for a second time when peers voted to remove a clause giving the prosecution the right to apply for certain lengthy and complex trials to be conducted without a jury. Voting was 160 to 116, a majority of 44. The opposition later accepted clauses to allow the prosecution to apply for a trial to be carried out without a jury where there was a danger of jury tampering. The move came after the government accepted Conservative and Liberal Democrat criticism of the clause. The government suffered a third defeat when peers voted to remove proposals on the extent to which evidence of a person's bad character can be disclosed during a trial. Voting was 166 to 115, a majority of 51. The bill now goes back to the commons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
