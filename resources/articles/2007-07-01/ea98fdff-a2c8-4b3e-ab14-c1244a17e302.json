V\u00e9lib", "bodyText": "Paris has a public-transport system that Britons can only dream of. It is fast, efficient and cheap. But such is the tradition of the tarmac being greener on the other side of the Channel, London's success at taming the car was being hailed yesterday in France as an example to follow. The latest scheme to displace the car from the centre of Paris is called V\u00e9lib, which means \"bike freedom\". For a modest outlay of \u20ac1, you can rent any of 10,600 bicycles from 750 automated stations around the capital. There is little chance of winning one of the stages in the Tour de France in the heavy, clunky, three-geared contraption the prospective rider is presented with. But it is solid and cheap. Before heading bravely off into the traffic flows around the Place de L'\u00c9toile, where 12 avenues converge, riders have to first study and inwardly digest a notice on the handlebars which states: \"I will stop at red lights, I will respect one-way streets.\" Fat chance of that, or of many of the 22,000 people who used the system on the first day wearing helmets. But the cynics, who predicted that bicycles and taxis would not mix, have been proved wrong - so far. In London the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured on the roads has fallen by nearly a third in the last decade, mainly because of bicycle lanes. In Paris, until now dominated by the car, the shortage of cycle lanes is a problem, but the roll-out has proved a hit. Proposing a similar scheme in London could be bicycle-loving Boris Johnson's first act as mayoral candidate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
