There was some vague argy-bargy between Cameron and Miliband about youth unemployment. Both decided they were right, though not until after Cameron had said the Labour leader was \"so leftwing, so politically correct and so completely ineffective\". And MPs complain that the media don't treat them with courtesy. Nick Raynsford complained that foreign visitors to the Olympics next year would see \"shocking images\" of homeless people strewn in the streets by Tory cuts. Cameron replied that if the MP for Greenwich, where much of the Games will happen, couldn't speak up for the Olympics, there really was a problem. There are times when I want to lean over the press gallery and shout: \"No, you pillock, he was complaining about people being homeless, not about the Games. Are you being deliberately obtuse or does it come naturally?\" But instead I just mutter to my neighbour. Ed Miliband raised the selling off of the woodlands. Was the PM happy with this flagship policy? The result was this exchange: Prime minister: The short answer to that is \u2026 Loads of Labour MPs: \"No!\" Prime minister (almost simultaneously): \"No!\" Poor Miliband, scuppering by a trick answer! Cameron hummed and hawed, but clearly the policy is dead. Or as a Labour backbencher put it: \"Timber!\" Then it kicked off. Philip Davies, never knowingly under-extremed, complained about the supreme court ruling that sex offenders might apply to be removed from the sex offenders register. His constituents were \"sick to the back teeth\" of criminals' human rights being put before law-abiding citizens. For Mr Cameron it was the perfect opening. He was \"appalled\" at the court's ruling. He would take the \"minimum possible approach\" to it, ie ignore it completely. He would make things even tougher for sex offenders than they are now. (The word \"castration\" was never actually spoken, but hung in the air.) We were going to have a British bill of rights, so that parliament took these decisions, and not the courts! I'll believe that when I see it. Meanwhile there is no doubt that the prime minister had scored a brilliant \"twofer\". He had at the same time assailed paedophiles and lawyers, two of the most unpopular groups in Britain. Next Theresa May chipped in to agree. The home secretary wants \"the bar to be set as high as possible\". Everything possible would be done to make life hellish for the loathsome paedos. (I paraphrase, but not much.) Like all parents, I am horrified by what paedophiles do. But the implication that these are the only criminals who are never to be allowed the possibility of redemption, remorse or reform is disturbing \u2013 and I speak as a paid-up bleeding heart, do-gooder liberal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
