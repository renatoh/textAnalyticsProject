But being dropped has nothing to do Manchester United's controversial goalless draw against Arsenal at Old Trafford 10 days ago. Holland's coach Dick Advocaat took the decision because his star striker kicked out at a bottle of water in anger at being substituted midway through the second half of a 3-1 defeat by the Czech Republic on September 10. The Czechs duly topped the group to secure a place in the finals. Holland will finish second, whatever the result against Moldova, and thus enter the play-offs. Holland's preparation for the match with the Czechs had been clouded by allegations of dressing-room strife involving not only Van Nistelrooy but also Edgar Davids of Juventus. After the match Advocaat was asked about the bottle incident and said: \"That's allowed.\" But his real opinion was communicated to Van Nistelrooy, who, according to a statement from the Dutch FA \"has since apologised and accepted that he would miss the Moldova game.\" Advocaat also dropped the Rangers defender Fernando Ricksen for disciplinary reasons. He was reported to have kicked in a hotel door after a 2-0 win over Belarus in June. Van Nistelrooy has paid tribute to his Manchester United team-mates for helping him to withstand the pressure generated by the bad-tempered finale of the Old Trafford draw with Arsenal when he missed a penalty and was jostled by opponents at the final whistle. \"I was so disappointed after the penalty miss,\" he said, \"but everyone in the dressing room got behind me and helped me get over it.\" Van Nistelrooy proved he had recovered by hitting a hat-trick last Saturday in United's 4-1 defeat of Leicester City. A training ground dust-up with Liverpool's John Arne Riise has cost the Roma striker John Carew his place in Norway's squad for their crucial qualifier against Luxembourg. Carew and Riise clashed before last month's friendly against Portugal. Nils Johan Semb, Norway's coach, said: \"I got a signal from Carew via his agent that he would say no to playing, but I still wanted to get in contact with the player before taking any decisions. He hasn't yet been in touch.\" Norway, fourth in group two, must win to stand any chance of qualifying for the finals in Portugal. Celtic's Stanislav Varga has been recalled by Slovakia after a two-year absence for the group seven qualifier against Liechtenstein. The Slovak coach Ladislav Jurkemik said he was impressed by the defender's display in Celtic's 2-0 Champions League defeat of Lyon on Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
