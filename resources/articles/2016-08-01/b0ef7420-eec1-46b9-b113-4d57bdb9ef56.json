The Russian saved match point in the ninth game of the third set and had Konta on the ropes again in the 11th game, before the British No1 held with an ace that kissed the line. Serving to stay in the tournament at 5-6 after three hours, Kuznetsova gave another two match points when she pushed a forehand wide. Again, Konta wasted the chances, also failing to put away a sitter at the net. They fought through four deuce points and another two match points before Konta steadied her nerves to finish the job with a forehand that forced a final wayward response from the Russian. It was not one of Konta\u2019s most fluid performances but it was one of her most impressive in terms of persistence and nerve \u2013 at least at the very end. Konta will next face either second seed Angelique Kerber or Australia\u2019s Sam Stosur, and she insisted thoughts of a medal are far from her mind. \u201cI\u2019m just as far as I am close,\u201d she said. \u201cI just played an incredibly long match and right now it\u2019ll be about me recovering the best I can and being prepared for tomorrow.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
