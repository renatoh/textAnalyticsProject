It had been suggested that his absence from Europe's only major championship was a mistake, but last night he said: \"My response to anyone who suggests that the European team will be anything but a strongly bonded team is: believe that at your peril.\" The German, who is nowadays based in Florida and did not play at Troon because of an injured wrist, added: \"There are few more competitive persons than myself and I will leave nothing to chance.\" He said he was \"thrilled\" by what he saw on television and went on: \"We are always the underdogs for the Ryder Cup, on paper, but with nine Europeans in the top 25 and six of those in qualifying positions for the Ryder Cup this was a very positive result.\" As for \"not bonding\" at the Open, Langer said: \"The last thing the guys wanted was for me to be distracting them when their focus was on the winning of the Open. \"You don't go to the Open to bond for the Ryder Cup, or chit-chat over dinner. There'll be plenty of time for that. We'll be ready and we'll be a team.\" The captain also gave a broad hint that Colin Montgomerie, despite a poor final round, was still in his thinking for a place in the team, probably as one of the captain's picks. \"He played brilliantly,\" he said, adding, \"and Lee Westwood emphasised with a best-of-the-weekend finish of 68-67 that he will win a major championship.\" Langer, who has said that he watches the Golf Channel reporting from every European event, believes that there is already a strong nucleus for the team. \"The top five in the rankings, with seven tournaments to go,\" he said, \"are Sergio Garc\u00eda, Padraig Harrington, Darren Clarke, Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez and Lee Westwood. \"They all have terrific Ryder Cup experience - they have 49 matches between them - and I know we are going to have a strong team capable of bringing the cup back.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
