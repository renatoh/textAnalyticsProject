The Guus Hiddink effect has long been known to Dutchmen. The worry is that the manager has arrived in west London at precisely the wrong moment. \"The first thing I thought when Hiddink came was 'Oh no',\" Van Persie said. \"'Chelsea are still in the FA Cup and the Champions League and he will win something.' He is unbelievable. Everything he does turns to gold. When I saw him two years ago in Holland, because we use the same physio sometimes, I asked to see his hands. He said: 'Yes, why?' I said that everything he puts his hand on turns to gold. He was laughing. He is fantastic.\" Hiddink has galvanised Chelsea. A team that was listing under Luiz Felipe Scolari now bristles with purpose and their results have been eye-catching; six Premier League wins in seven have been supplemented by Champions League progress against Juventus and Liverpool. But Van Persie is in bullish mood. It was put to him that Arsenal might be the form team in England over the past month. \"It's a bit more than that, no?\" he said with a smile. Arsenal are on a run of five straight convincing victories in the league and a positive spin has now covered the 13 unbeaten fixtures before that. They were pock-marked by eight draws, at least half of them hugely damaging to the club's title hopes, but the overall sequence says undefeated in 18. Progress in the FA Cup and Champions League has swelled the feel-good factor. Arsenal's aggregate win over Villarreal in the quarter-finals of Europe's elite competition, which has set up a showdown against Manchester United, was notable for its comfort. The run in the Premier League began with the 2\u20131 victory at Stamford Bridge on 30 November, Van Persie scoring both of the goals as his team gave an illustration of their spirit, and he sees further reasons to be cheerful when he considers the seven goals that Chelsea have conceded in their last two fixtures. Bolton and then Liverpool in the Champions League gave the goalkeeper Petr Cech nightmares and exposed defensive leaks. \"That is what I noticed, \" said Van Persie. \"In the last two games they conceded seven goals and it's a bit too much but they have fantastic strikers and covered everything up. If you look at [Didier] Drogba, he is back again, he looks really sharp. Of course, earlier in the season [at Stamford Bridge] we showed we can do that damage. It will be a tight game again and we are both not scared to play. For me it will be a fantastic experience to play at Wembley because it will be my first time there.\" Van Persie was dismayed to be named on the bench for the 2005 FA Cup final at the Millennium Stadium, having started in the previous five fixtures, but he helped to effect a happy ending by coming on to score in the penalty shoot-out win over Manchester United. That was Arsenal's last trophy and it seems an awfully long time ago to everybody at the club, not least Van Persie. In the ensuing years the self-assured boy from Rotterdam has developed into one of the team's leaders, his importance illustrated by the profile afforded to his as yet unresolved new contract talks, and he believes that Arsenal's time as nearly men must end. \"For me and for everyone the thing is to come into the semis and finals. After that the differences will be very small between winning and losing,\" he said. \"Last season in the Champions League final, look at [John] Terry. He was so unlucky to miss the penalty but that means Manchester United are the winners. When you are in the final, it comes down to little things. We can call ourselves one of the best four teams in Europe and that is about right. Now we want to move on and win it. Definitely. \"It's been my target to be one of the top four teams in Europe and I wanted to do it with Arsenal. That is the biggest part of my dream. But that is not everything, I really want to win. We are in the last four in Europe, the last four in England and we can qualify for the Champions League again through the league. I want more. I want to achieve.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
