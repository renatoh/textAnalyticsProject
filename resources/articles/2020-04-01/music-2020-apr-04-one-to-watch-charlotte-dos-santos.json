Her songs are like chiffony fairytales: rippling Spanish guitar and playful orchestration that sounds like little else around. Dos Santos, 30, attributes her love of flamenco, samba and bossa nova to her Norwegian mother and Brazilian father. She studied jazz at Berklee College of Music in Boston, but a year out in Valencia, where she learned how to arrange Mediterranean music and studied Spanish medieval history and art, opened her up to new possibilities. She \u201cfell in love with the idea of a woman being in power, ruling these incredible castles\u201d, she has said, resulting in her 2017 coming-of-age debut, Cleo, in which she imagined herself as a symbol of \u201cfemininity, strength, royalty, independence and courage\u201d. Dos Santos especially wants to represent the \u201cwomen of colour\u201d back in her native Norway and be the role model she didn\u2019t see growing up. On her recent EP, Harvest Time, jazz, folk and Latin-American rhythms intertwine to shimmering effect. Helio is about self-sufficiency and \u201cbeing the centre of your own universe\u201d, Dos Santos has said, while the harp and Gregorian chanting of Padre suggest Joanna Newsom for the nu-jazz age or a loungey Little Dragon. If that doesn\u2019t sound like a healing balm, what does? \u2022 Harvest Time is out now on Because Music"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
