Shoalhaven Zoo \u201cIt\u2019s not like other zoos,\u201d says Nowra silversmith Naomi Dootson, who has spent a lot of time at Shoalhaven Zoo with her three children and visitors over the years. \u201cIt\u2019s right beside the river and so picturesque.\u201d Spread among natural rock formations over six hectares on the banks of the Shoalhaven River at North Nowra, the zoo has the largest collection of native animals in New South Wales, while the exotics include two recently acquired lion cubs. Catch animal shows and keeper talks between 11 and 3 or book a close encounter. A well-priced annual pass encourages more than one visit, so you can follow the cubs\u2019 progress. Shoalhaven Zoo, Nowra, in the state\u2019s Shoalhaven region. 2. Trees Adventure Bird\u2019s-eye views of the animals is one of the bonuses that comes with a visit to this tree and clifftop adventure playground alongside the Shoalhaven River, in Shoalhaven Zoo. You\u2019ll soar over the zoo on a flying fox before rigging up to tackle high ropes and a cliff-face climbing challenge graded by age. Book in for a terrific half-day or longer holiday program for the whole family. The height-averse are invited to watch or supervise free of charge. 3. Jervis Bay Wild Humpback whales are seen in greater numbers every year, and between May and November there are few better places to see them up close than the New South Wales South Coast. Lighthouse lookouts make terrific vantage points and a whale-watching cruise increases your odds of a sighting ... plus, you can take in the beautiful arc of the Jervis Bay shoreline from the sea. The smiling bottlenose dolphin is another bay dweller, and with a boatload of people to impress will cavort alongside in the marine park waters at speeds of up to 37kmh. Book your tour with Jervis Bay Wild. 4. Learn to surf with a pro Most weekends and every school holiday you can spy a wiry blonde in a rashie and bucket hat, pushing kids onto waves at Mollymook or Narrawallee. Pam Burridge, the former world champion, has lived in the area for years and her surf school and surf retreats are adored by legions of grommets - and bucket-listing parents - for igniting a passion that endures far beyond the holiday. When the swell is under par Burridge has a fleet of stand-up paddleboards at the ready, perfect for gliding over the stingrays near the boat ramp at Bendalong. For children over 5 and the young at heart. All gear is supplied. 5. Get crafty Naomi Dootson spearheaded Nowra-based The Artisan Collective and runs workshops at her Worrigee home studio. She leads ring-making workshops in groups of three, for anyone over the age of 10, and promises three rings in three hours. Soldering, texturing and finishing are all part of the session. For a date night with a difference, couples can attend a ring-making workshop with bubbles and nibbles supplied. \u201cMake your own ring or for one another - if you trust them!\u201d You can find Naomi\u2019s Appleye-branded jewellery alongside other artisan-made goods at Nowra store Wild Tribe on Kinghorne Street. At nearby Bonza Beads, owner Julie will help walk-ins fashion a necklace or suncatcher in no time. 6. Go bush Pristine coastline, a 387km-long river that drops from the mountains to the sea, and a string of national parks gives avid bushwalkers many choices. Dootson and her family hit the trails regularly. \u201cIn winter we do a lot of bushwalking and generally if people visit we take them out too,\u201d Dootson says. \u201cBens Walk along the Shoalhaven River is an easy one for all ages. We often take a picnic, and once even had a birthday party that was Lord of the Rings themed!\u201d Another favourite track is the Grotto at North Nowra. Follow the signs and note the warnings re cliffs. 7. Showtime For a charm-laden movie experience check the programs at Huskisson Pictures and Inlet Cinema at Sussex Inlet. Valley Movies in Kangaroo Valley Community Hall shows alternative films on the third Friday of the month. Dootson suggests a matinee with the kids at the Roxy on Junction Street, Nowra. Order mega shakes from Cherubs 3 Cafe and settle into the old-school seats for the show. \u201cIf you visit in the July school holidays you can catch Wicked, a live production from the excellent local theatre group at the Shoalhaven Entertainment Centre,\u201d Dootson says. For arts listings through the region take a look at South Coast Tickets. 8. Surf the Shoalhaven From Seven Mile Beach in the north to North Durras further south, the Shoalhaven\u2019s spectacular beaches and surf breaks attract board riders from all over. Culburra is the home town of Tyler Wright, back-to-back world champion in 2016 and 2017, while Pam Burridge calls Bendalong home. Beginners will find joy throughout the region. 9. Wholefood heroes With a menu based on vegetables and fruit from two local growers, Milkhaus at Milton occupies an old cheese factory high on the ridge and serves wholesome plant-based dishes championing the ingredients of the day. Milkhaus is running two winter workshops on improving and supporting the immune system, with bone broth and gut health the focus. Other wholefood options include Pilgrims, which offers vegetarian delights at Milton and Huskisson, and The Treehouse Cafe in Ulladulla. 10. Family meals and a holiday treat \u2013 or two Eating with kids in tow can be a challenge on holiday. Sonia Greig, from Berry\u2019s one-hat restaurant South on Albany, suggests booking into Bussola, a rustic Italian eatery with wood fired pizza, antipasto and handmade pastas to keep everyone in the family happy. And the fish and chips from Pelican Rocks Cafe at Greenwell Point come highly rated - in 2017 they won best fish and chips in NSW! Southbound, bakery and cafe stops include Nowra\u2019s Kinghorne Bakery and The Cake Store; the backstreet Berry Sourdough Cafe and Milkwood on the main drag; and Milton\u2019s Flour Water Salt. Ravenous surfers often refuel at Hayden\u2019s Pies at Ulladulla, and no South Coast trip is complete without a hot cinnamon treat from the Berry Donut Van. 11. Farmstay Holiday parks and motor inns are well positioned for beach and bush activities year-round, with several properties offering camping or cabins between Bawley Point and Mollymook in particular. Luxury Kangaroo Valley farmstay, The Cedars, has several cottages set on 400 hectares bordered by Morton and Budderoo national parks. Ferndale, the newest, accommodates eight and there\u2019s also a yurt for two. Breakfast on fresh eggs and sourdough, help with the animal feed then go wildlife spotting on the walking trails beside beautiful Barrengarry Creek. Off-property, the Kangaroo Valley township has every foodie and adventure wish covered. 12. Vegan retreat Wellness, vegan fare and interaction with myriad rescue animals is a recipe for relaxation and restoration at Back 2 Earth, a Berry retreat and animal sanctuary. Visit for the day or book a bed-and-breakfast farm stay in one of the self-contained cottages and explore the two-hectare property planted with organic fruit trees and vegetables. Hosts Jenny Friedland and Marc Hammond, a trained chef who specialises in raw food, welcome children. \u201cThere\u2019s time with the animals twice a day,\u201d Friedland says. \u201cIt\u2019s a child\u2019s paradise.\u201d And there are in-house massages for the grown-ups.
