The Football League chairmen will discuss the proposal today after the league received several complaints about Leicester's promotion to the Premiership. Leicester's loudest opponents, notably Walsall's chairman Mike Lloyd, Sheffield United's manager Neil Warnock and the directors of relegated Grimsby, have proposed that Micky Adams's team should not be allowed promotion. That will not happen now, but a club in Leicester's position next season could be demoted to the Second Division rather than promoted. It is ironic that Leicester will stage today's meeting. They will face strong accusations of gaining unfair advantage over their First Division opponents. When they went into administration this season they had 90% of their \u00a37m debts to the Inland Revenue wiped out and, to the irritation of many rival clubs, they subsequently did not have to sell any leading players. The league's chairman Sir Brian Mawhinney set up a working party that has devised three different proposals: deducting six league points, docking 12 points, or relegation at the end of the season.The issue is almost certain to proceed to a vote at the league AGM on June 5. After then, it is feasible that Ipswich, another club who have been in administration this season, could come under threat next campaign if they are in the same position. \"Some people in football are upset that clubs are going into administration, getting rid of their debt and then gaining a benefit over their rivals,\" said Dr Bill Gerrard, a specialist in sports finance at Leeds University's business school. \"This has been highlighted by the case of Leicester.\" The proposals would also see any club that spends an entire season in administration being relegated. And a club going into administration twice in three years could be expelled from the league."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
