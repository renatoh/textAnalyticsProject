However, more problematically, Arctic Monkeys' South Yorkshire return coincides with their difficult third album. Humbug's less immediate, twangier sound derived from spells in the American desert \u2013 rather than Rotherham flats \u2013 hasn't gone down as well with fans as its two chart-busting predecessors. This makes for an uneven gig as oldies like I Bet You Look Good On the Dancefloor generate pandemonium, while one new song \u2013 the plodding Jeweller's Hands \u2013 prompts a drift towards the loos. It's not the ideal time for the band to make the difficult step up to arenas. In fact, apart from a stunning entrance \u2013 the band, shrouded in mist, stood like gunslingers \u2013 the band often play as if the audience aren't there. Turner's lyrics \u2013 so crucial to the gently beautiful new single Cornerstone \u2013 are often lost amid the band's rockier sound and a vast echo. Creditably, the now Brooklyn-based singer doesn't milk the occasion by howling \"Sheffield, let's rawk\", but the Monkeys do need to find a way to balance their integrity with the cheesier demands of arena rock. They certainly can do it: when ticker tape showers the crowd during Secret Door and Fluorescent Adolescent is masterfully segued into Mardy Bum, it kicks off a stunning final 20 minutes. A rollicking When the Sun Goes Down brings together a crowd who clearly just want to sing along."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
