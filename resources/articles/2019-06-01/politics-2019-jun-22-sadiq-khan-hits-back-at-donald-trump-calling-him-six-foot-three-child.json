The mayor of London made the comment in a room of teachers at the Together for Education event at Central Hall in Westminster on Saturday. Khan joked that he had made sure to switch his phone off. He said: \u201cFor those of you that have your phones on, if somebody starts tweeting about me \u2013 a 6ft 3 child in the White House \u2013 can you let me know?\u201d It is the latest insult to be fired between Khan and Trump, in what has been a long-running feud. The US president called Khan a \u201cstone cold loser\u201d, mocked his height and misspelt his name in a tweet sent as he touched down in Air Force One for a state visit to the UK earlier this month. The US president previously described London\u2019s mayor as a \u201cdisaster\u201d and called him a \u201cnational disgrace who is destroying the city of London\u201d, slamming Khan\u2019s record on crime in the capital. Earlier this week, Tory leadership hopeful Jeremy Hunt said he fully agreed with Trump\u2019s assessment of Khan\u2019s knife-crime record. Khan described Trump as a \u201cposter boy for racists\u201d and remarked that the president appears \u201cobsessed\u201d with him. The mayor\u2019s remark at the Together for Education event \u2013 a one day celebration \u2013 prompted laughter, cheers and applause from those gathered. The event, run by the National Education Union, will include talks from headteachers, governors and parents about school funding. Schools have lost out on \u00a35.4bn since 2015. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is also due to speak at the event. An analysis by the NEU published in April found that special needs provision in England had lost out on \u00a31.2bn because of shortfalls in funding increases from central government since 2015. Speaking at the event, Khan said Britain\u2019s next prime minister must ensure schools are given proper funding. He said: \u201cSchools are at financial breaking point, teachers have been systematically undervalued, we have a great crisis in recruitment and retention, and teachers are having to spend their own money to ensure that children have the materials they need. \u201cMy message to the next prime minister today is simple: enough is enough. This cannot continue. It\u2019s time to give our education system and the next generation the investment they deserve.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
