Boateng was booked for his first-half challenge on Germany's captain, whose right ankle buckled horribly in Saturday's FA Cup final. Ballack tried to play on but was forced to admit defeat just before the interval. He left Wembley with his lower leg in a protective boot. Ballack was due to have a scan yesterday afternoon but the swelling was so bad that it had to be postponed. He will try again today. Although the German's tone in the wake of the incident was characteristically measured, there was no mistaking his anger. \"It wasn't a good tackle,\" the midfielder said. \"I've seen it on TV and it didn't look a good tackle and when I was on the pitch, I knew it would be really difficult to carry on. I tried, but it wasn't possible. I've had a few injuries and if you can't carry on, that's always a bad sign. Sometimes it's bruising or sometimes it's a nerve that stops you.\" Boateng was born in Germany but he has declared for Ghana and will represent them at the World Cup. Germany will face Ghana in their final Group D tie on 23 June and, in a further twist, Boateng's younger brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me, the Hamburg defender, is expected to be in the Germany squad. Ballack was asked whether Boateng's tackle was the sort to make a player miss a sizeable chunk of his career. \"Of course,\" he replied. \"As you know, I had one from Titus Bramble [in April 2007], which wasn't even given as a foul, and it took me eight months to come back. It's bad when it happens.\" Portsmouth were highly committed from the off, with Michael Brown in particular looking to rattle Frank Lampard. \"You could see when they started putting in a few hard tackles and didn't get a yellow card, they will carry on,\" Ballack said. \"I don't want to blame the Portsmouth players, but they were given the chance to play hard against us. But if it gets to the point where players are getting bad injuries, then it has to be stopped. \"If I was on the Portsmouth bench, I would have told them to play hard. There were a few tackles on [Nicolas] Anelka and there was no yellow card. There was another one by Michael Brown on [Frank] Lampard and from that, you can see they just want to kick players. So if you don't give them a yellow card, you can't stop them, so they carry on.\" Brown felt that the match was not \"over-physical\". He added: \"It was a cup tie. We had to stop them playing and get tight to them but that's normal. The only bad one was Kevin on Ballack and we hope he is OK. You have to try and unsettle a team like Chelsea.\" Ballack, 34 in September and out of contract in the summer, has told the Chelsea board that he wants his future to be sorted out before Germany begin their World Cup against Australia on 13 June. He has been offered a one-year extension but wants two years. \"There are no plans for talks yet but I want to play for as long as possible at the highest level,\" he said. \"I have targets in my mind, maybe two years. But we have to wait and see. I want to sort it out before the World Cup, definitely, and Chelsea is one of my first options. \"I have spoken to Carlo Ancelotti [the Chelsea manager] and I know that he wants to keep me. He said this in January, February. I have a great relationship with him and he is really confident in me and my ability. There is no problem between me and the coach about his ideas. Sometimes, the club and the coach can have different ideas \u2013 I don't know. But it's time to talk about it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
