The project has resulted in a series of CDs and DVDs, and was honoured at last week's BBC Radio 2 Folk awards. But until now, there has never been a tour outside Scotland, which is extraordinary. This concert followed the same free-wheeling formula as the TV shows. The 17-piece ensemble included celebrated Scottish and Irish traditional musicians along with their counterparts from the Americana scene, with the house band led by the celebrated Shetland fiddler Aly Bain, and the American exponent of the dobro guitar, Jerry Douglas. The all-acoustic lineup included piano, accordion and whistles, with Tim O'Brien switching between mandolin, banjo and fiddle, and Danny Thompson (the only Englishman on stage) on double bass. They provided classy backing for a varied revue involving eight singers, including O'Brien and his sister Mollie. There was Dan Tyminski (who provided the singing voice for George Clooney in O Brother, Where Art Thou?) with a driving treatment of Man of Constant Sorrow from the film. Then there was sturdy fiddle work and vocals from \"progressive bluegrass\" artist Sara Watkins; a fine weepie from Scotland's Eddi Reader; rapid-fire Gaelic \"mouth music\" from Karen Matheson, and traditional and new songs from Ireland's Cara Dillon, another winner at the folk awards. It was an evening of fine musicianship in which one song stood out. The first Transatlantic Session, 15 years ago, included Kate and Anna McGarrigle singing Talk to Me of Mendocino. Now, following Kate's death, it was revived by the five female singers on stage, with delicate dobro backing from Douglas. It was an exquisite, emotional tribute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
