Tesco is now one of the world's top grocers. Can anything stop this juggernaut? Not if you believe analysts who say annual Tesco profits could soon break the magic \u00a32 billion barrier. Doubly impressive given that the firm broke the \u00a31bn barrier just two years ago. Under Sir Terry Leahy's steely obsession with efficiency, Tesco is eating away at the competition in every retail sector. This will be helped by a recent Government move to relax planning restrictions on out-of-town mega-shops. Its buying power can hurt Dixons, Comet and the like, and as Britain's number one retailer of baby goods, Tesco is squashing Boots and Mothercare. The giant is taking great strides into the corner shop market, to the consternation of small fry such as Londis and Big Food Group. This all added up to pre-tax profits up by almost 18 per cent to \u00a31.6bn, on sales which rose by nearly 19 per cent to \u00a333.6bn. Competition on price will intensify following Morrison's acquisition of Safeway. But while managements of the two businesses are integrated, Tesco can steal a march, particularly as it is raising \u00a31.5bn to fund expansion. Its overseas drive began with failure in France. Now, though, it is the number one grocer in eastern Europe. In the Far East things haven't gone smoothly but its international operations still make it \u00a3306m. Tesco managers are generally promoted from within - known for being down-to-earth pragmatists, rather than flashy Oxbridge types with degrees from business schools. So far, so lucrative. But there are icebergs. As profits continue to rise, you can bet the Treasury will be working out ways to claw some revenue back, although the store says it make just 3.5p in profit from every pound spent at the tills. A new price war will not just hit the company's hard-pressed suppliers. It will be hard to ensure profits keep on growing in the future. And international forays have been the graveyard of many UK concerns. Empires rise and empires fall. Tesco's, though, has some way to go before the Goths storm its citadels. Aventis vaccinated against competition Stand by for a new drugs war. One that pitches big business against national politicians. At stake is the French government's ambition to see a national pharmaceutical drug giant take on the world. Earlier this year, Sanofi- Synthelabo unveiled a \u00a330bn takeover of its larger French rival Aventis. While this was not recommended by Aventis's board the deal had the backing of the government and unions. Now this dream lies in tatters, thanks to last week's bid by Swiss rival Novartis. It is clear that Novartis sounded out the government before approaching Aventis with potentially a significantly higher offer. But subsequent reaction from prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin suggest that Novartis may find it hard to get French approval. Raffarin said the need to vaccinate people against bio-terrorism could be a reason for overruling a foreign takeover of Aventis. Such talk may frighten off Novartis and fail to flush out a higher offer from Sanofi-Synthelabo that shareholders may ultimately accept. Don't rip up the rule book for Amerindo If there are golden rules of investment, the main two would be don't buy at the top and don't sell at the bottom. Those who chose the Amerindo Internet Fund, an investment trust launched at the peak of tech fever in March 2000, as their vehicle are now being asked to ignore the second one. Millennium Partners, a New York hedge fund, has amassed a 30 per cent stake in the trust and has asked for it to be wound up so that it can get an exit at close to net asset value. For Millennium, that is astute. It paid 8p a share for its stake; the shares are now trading at 14.25p and, if the trust's assets can be sold at close to their book value, it could realise as much as 17.8p. For the poor punters who bought in at the 100p launch price it would be a severe loss. Amerindo is confident that they can do better by waiting, and it promises another winding-up vote in 2009. The key question is whether that will mean greater returns for shareholders than winding it up now. Amerindo's managers insist it will. Circulars say the internet is finally coming of age. Certainly, its quoted portfolio - which represents 87 per cent of its portfolio and includes titans such as eBay, Expedia and Yahoo!, has more than trebled in value since the trough of the market. But Amerindo's success depends on making profits from its portfolio of unquoted companies. Appetite for new issues is slowly returning, allowing the flotation of one of Amerindo's investments, Eyetech, which is now trading at four times the original investment value. Others would need to follow. To its credit however, Amerindo has actually done better than rivals and has beaten the technology indices. That means it deserves the benefit of the doubt.
