The Grizzlies got 20 points and 10 rebounds from Gasol and 18 points and 10 rebounds from Zach Randolph. Pondexter and Conley scored 13 apiece. Kevin Martin scored 25 for Oklahoma City, which trailed for much of the game but was able to avoid repeating its Game One loss from when these two teams met in the West semifinals two years ago. The Thunder were able to rally and win that series in seven. Game 2 is Tuesday night in Oklahoma City. Indiana Pacers 102-95 New York Knicks Pacers lead series 1-0 The Indiana Pacers took home-court advantage away from the New York Knicks, as David West scored 20 points in a 102-95 win in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinals. Paul George scored 19 points and D.J. Augustin added 16 for the Pacers, who built a 16-point lead while Carmelo Anthony was on the bench in foul trouble in the third quarter, and easily held on to spoil the Knicks' first second-round game since 2000. Anthony finished with 27 points and 11 rebounds, but was frustrated by the Pacers' rugged defense and by the referees. He shot 10 of 28 from the field. The Pacers, who allowed the second-fewest points per game and the lowest field goal percentage in the league during the regular season, mixed in solid offense as well. The Knicks hope to have reserves Amare Stoudemire (right knee surgery) and Steve Novak (back spasms) back during the series. LeBron James named MVP LeBron James was the overwhelming choice as the NBA's Most Valuable Player. The Miami Heat star took 120 of 121 first-place votes in this year's balloting, giving him the award for the fourth time. Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant finished second and the New York Knicks' Carmelo Anthony was third. Anthony received the only other first-place vote from a panel of broadcasters and sports writers who cover the league. Shaquille O'Neal had been the closest to sweeping every first-place vote, taking 120 of a possible 121 in the 1999-2000 balloting. James becomes the fifth player with at least four MVP awards, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. All four of James' awards have come in a five-year span, something only done by Russell. Shaquille O'Neal in Twitter spat with Jose Canseco Shaquille O'Neal meanwhile became embroiled in a bizarre Twitter spat with former baseball star Jose Canseco. Brooklyn Nets sack coach PJ Carlesimo The Brooklyn Nets will not offer a new contract to interim head coach P.J. Carlesimo, commencing the search for a new coach one day after being eliminated from the playoffs, General Manager Billy King said on Sunday. After spending some $350 million to upgrade their roster for their debut season in Brooklyn, the Nets had loftier expectations than a first-round ouster by the injury-hit Chicago Bulls in a Game Seven on the Nets' new home court. They re-signed starters Deron Williams, Brook Lopez and Gerald Wallace and traded with the Atlanta Hawks for All-Star Joe Johnson. Despite reaching the playoffs for the first time since 2007, the Nets did not go as far as they hoped. Carlesimo, 63, went 35-19 in the regular season, winning 12 of his first 14 games, after taking over in December from the fired Avery Johnson, who had lost 10 of 13 games as the Nets slipped to 14-14. Carlesimo has an NBA career record of 239-315, also serving as a head coach with Portland, Golden State and Seattle/Oklahoma City. His record in the playoffs is 6-13. The first year in the life of the Brooklyn Nets"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
