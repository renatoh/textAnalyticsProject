The finance company Invicta Capital has bought the rights to the film and will lease them back to the production company. The film is the last to qualify for section 42 status, under which investors get a 40% tax break for three years and face little risk. Mohammed Yusef, chairman of Invicta, said the industry was waiting for details of film financing deals from the chancellor that might replace section 42. Jill Treanor Centurion approves \u00a3525m bid from Dana Gas Centurion, an oil and gas firm operating in Egypt and West Africa, has agreed on a $1bn (\u00a3525m) takeover from Dana Gas of the United Arab Emirates. But City analysts said the price tag was not a \"knock out\" and the move could flush out a rival bidder. Centurion, a Canadian company that also has a London stock market listing, has agreed to pay Dana a $35m break fee if it recommends a rival bid. Among Centurion's projects is a joint venture in Egypt with Royal Dutch Shell. On Friday, Centurion's shares jumped 22.5p to 497.5p in London after it revealed it was in talks about a possible offer. Nick Fletcher \u00a32.5m for highest paid director on junior market The highest paid director of a company listed on Aim, the London stock exchange's junior market, earned more than \u00a32.5m last year. According to a survey by Growth Company Investor the package earned by Allan Kerr, chief executive of metals and minerals company Wogen, was made up of salary, bonus and pension contributions. It came in a year when the company's shares lost 50% of their value. In contrast the lowest paid chief executive on Aim - Gary Heming at Rusia Mining - received a total of just \u00a32,500. For the first time, the average pay of the top 10 Aim chief executives topped \u00a31m. Jill Treanor ACM Shipping prepares for Aim float at \u00a327m ACM Shipping Group, an international oil tanker broker, is sailing onto the stock market with a planned listing on Aim which will value the company at around \u00a327m (\u20ac40bn). The company, founded in 1982, is raising around \u00a38m as part of the flotation, with dealings due to start next month. ACM hopes to expand geographically and also into other sectors such as gas tankers. Last year the company made operating profits of \u00a39.3m, before paying bonuses to its senior broking staff. It intends to pay bonuses of around 50% of operating profits to key staff, it said, in line with industry practice. Nick Fletcher Bradford &amp; Bingley goes back to selling mortgages The Bradford &amp; Bingley name will re-emerge in the mortgage market today when the former building society begins selling its home loan products after a three year absence. The bank had been acting as a broker for other firms' products but is now ditching that strategy. As part of this, the bank also intends to start selling its own-brand self-certification mortgages, aimed at customers who may find it harder to get a standard mortgage. B&amp;B is a major player in this self-cert market, which often targets the buy-to-let market and the self employed who cannot always prove their income.
