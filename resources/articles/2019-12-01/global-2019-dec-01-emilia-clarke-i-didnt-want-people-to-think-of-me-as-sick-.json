It was 2011, just before Valentine\u2019s Day and just after she\u2019d wrapped on the first series of Game of Thrones, playing Daenerys Targaryen, Breaker of Chains, Mother of Dragons. She didn\u2019t yet know, as she crawled into the locker room of her local gym in north London and vomited bile into the toilet, that Game of Thrones would run for seven further seasons, break Emmy-award records for most wins for a scripted television series and for a drama, be named one of the greatest TV shows of all time, and quickly come to define her. But there was much she didn\u2019t know. She didn\u2019t know that at 24 she had suffered a life-threatening stroke, a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) caused by bleeding into the space surrounding the brain. She didn\u2019t know, as she lay on the floor repeating lines from Game of Thrones in order to test her memory, that a third of SAH patients die immediately, or that those who survive require urgent treatment to avoid a second, often fatal bleed. She didn\u2019t know there was another swollen blood vessel in her brain, which had doubled in size by the time she finished filming season three. She didn\u2019t know that one day, eight years later, over biscuits on her pink sofa, she would be smiling with the dark realisation that her stroke was one of the best things that could have happened to her. Her pink sofa is in her pink house, which is also green and blue and muted shades of rust, and has a secret bar hidden in a courtyard shed, and an outdoor screening room heated by a wood-burning stove. To walk into her living room, where one corner is painted with a symbol relating to her mum, another to her late dad, and a third with a meaningful dragon, is to enter the cosiest corner of Clarke\u2019s mind. By the stairs, horsehair is visible in the plaster; the walls are stripped back to the bone. She shows me round with a raw sort of glee, a sense that her comfort and safety are bound into the details: the friends\u2019 art on the walls, the \u201csingle girl\u2019s\u201d bedroom. She moved in after Game of Thrones; in this and many ways, her life can be cleanly dissected into before and after. Before, Clarke, now 33, who grew up in Oxfordshire, had appeared in a single episode of the daytime soap Doctors. She was ambitious, optimistic and relentlessly cheerful. After, after Game of Thrones, and the death of her father, which shook her family, as did her life-threatening stroke, she is sitting on her pink sofa and contemplating a decade that changed her. \u201cAnd yes, I\u2019m at the point where I definitely think of the brain haemorrhage as a good thing,\u201d she nods. She has extremely expressive eyebrows that appear jointed \u2013 for every word Clarke says, and she says many, they add 15 more. \u201cBecause I was never destined to be the \u2018young actor goes off the rails\u2019 type, up and down the gossip columns. And having a brain haemorrhage that coincided precisely with the beginning of my career and the beginning of a show that became something quite meaty, it gave me a perspective that I wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI\u2019m quite a resilient human being, so a parent dying and brain haemorrhages coinciding with success and people following you in the street and getting stalkers \u2013 you\u2019re just, like, \u2018Well let\u2019s try and make something sensible of it.\u2019\u201d It was a decade that contained the very best and very worst of a life, and one of the sensible things she tried to make of it was the founding of a charity, SameYou, to provide treatment for people recovering from brain injuries and stroke. It was only in order to promote the charity that, eight years after her stroke, she finally decided to talk about it, in a piece for the New Yorker. \u201cOn the set, I didn\u2019t miss a beat, but I struggled,\u201d she wrote, of returning to Game of Thrones after brain surgery. \u201cSeason two would be my worst. I didn\u2019t know what Daenerys was doing. If I am truly being honest, every minute of every day I thought I was going to die.\u201d It\u2019s remarkable, considering her profile and her regular appearances in the Daily Mail in lovely dresses and grand smiles, that she managed to keep it secret for so long. She didn\u2019t want to tell strangers, \u201cBecause it was mine.\u201d She feared, too, that people would \u201csneer at it\u201d. It so happened that, the week before I went to meet her, I had a similar (though less dramatic) neurological diagnosis \u2013 when I tell her about it, for some reason my voice shakes. She is warm and quick with recommendations, and as she continues she says, \u201cWell, you know, then. You know the worries. That people will think your soul, your movement, your voice, who you were,\u201d was damaged. \u201cIt was nerve-racking to share it, to be honest. It always is, when you make yourself vulnerable.\u201d She waited so long to talk about it, because, \u201cI didn\u2019t want people to think of me as\u2026 sick.\u201d There are still days on set when she will quietly pull aside the makeup person and say, \u201c\u2018I think I\u2019m having a brain haemorrhage. I\u2019m not, I promise, but maybe just put me in a cold tent and we\u2019ll sit down for a second, and I apologise in advance if I freak you out.\u2019 Over the summer I was burning the candle at both ends, and I was with my mate on the plane. And I was like, \u2018Dude, I feel really weird\u2026\u2019 But I was fine. It\u2019s hard not to think the worst. It\u2019s hard to think you\u2019re overtired, or you\u2019ve been on Instagram too long, and to realise these might have the same side-effects as something deadly. But the charity evolves with me. I use it. Here\u2019s something else that I feel: maybe someone else feels the same way.\u201d She talks about the summer just gone with a regretful kind of wonder \u2013 it was th e summer after the Game of Thrones finale had divided fans, when she was coming to terms with how the \u201coverwhelming\u201d amount of nudity in the first season had affected her. And, after years of \u201cfilling every hiatus with a movie, shit, good or otherwise\u201d (she starred opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator Genisys, and as Qi\u2019ra in Solo: a Star Wars Story) she had decided to take a break. Or, the decision was made for her. \u201cAfter we did the premiere for the last season, it felt suddenly like I lost all of the bones in my body. And I was in this puddle on the floor going, \u2018Maybe this isn\u2019t just the show.\u2019 I\u2019d never wanted to look around and see what we had, because I was convinced it was just going to blow up in our faces. And, well, at the end it kind of did. So I kept my head down. Then, after the premiere, I finally was able to stop, and that was difficult.\u201d She travelled and went \u201craving with my mates, but that was not fulfilling. So, bloated and exhausted I went away for two weeks with my best girlfriend, [The Good Fight star] Rose Leslie, and it was in this retreat in India that I suddenly got it. This is what stopping feels like. And I was able to finally\u2026 be kind to myself.\u201d All this is recent. All this is really recent, with a new understanding of grief. Her beloved father, a theatre sound engineer, died of cancer in 2016. \u201cThe world felt like a scarier place once my dad wasn\u2019t in it,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cThere was the referendum, too,\u201d she shudders. \u201cIt was the year of everything bad.\u201d But it was after her lost summer that, \u201cI finally got this feeling. As if, on a cellular level, I\u2019d grown up. And it\u2019s so bittersweet, because I was clinging on to that childlike optimism. Then, when I finally let it go, I realised that was actually quite a heavy backpack to be wearing. I felt like that at the Emmys, too, finally popping my head up from the bunker. It\u2019s as if you can see the actual landscape that you\u2019ve been living in this entire time from another perspective.\u201d Occasionally she looks at me apologetically, her eyebrows like arrows, to check she\u2019s not saying too much, and then she continues. \u201cIt can be perceived as such a feminine trait, can\u2019t it \u2013 the responsibility to \u2018put a smile on it\u2019. And, and you feel like it\u2019s a defeat if you give in and admit, \u2018Maybe it\u2019s not going to be OK in the end.\u2019 But then, if you do, then you have an opportunity to go\u2026 \u2018and what if that\u2019s all right?\u2019 Death is shit,\u201d she says, dramatically. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard and grief is horrific, and yet it is completely and utterly guaranteed. No matter how much Silicon Valley boys want to prove to everyone it\u2019s not. But the finality of death, the absolute certainty of it, I\u2019ve realised, is such a tonic.\u201d Along with a good stroke, I add the loss of a parent to her list of recommendations. \u201cNo! I\u2019m not recommending it to anyone, obviously. But it is something real you can actually hold on to. We don\u2019t look at grief properly. I\u2019m not talking about the random moments of completely overwhelming emotion, I\u2019m pretty in control of that\u2026 there was only one time on set where I just physically couldn\u2019t stop crying. It\u2019s the other stuff that we don\u2019t discuss \u2013 the functional grief; when your worldview and your perspective on life and yourself changes irrevocably, forever.\u201d How is she dealing with that? \u201cBy realising that there is a framework that life lives within, and knowing when you reach the edges of it. There\u2019s that. And I try to use the shit feelings as opposed to just \u2018breathing through it\u2019. It\u2019s like putting my plastic in the recycling bin \u2013 it might not do anything, but I should at least try. And then being an actor and having a production company, knowing that the greater understanding I have about life, the greater storyteller I can be. As an actor, you\u2019re always observing \u2013 no matter what trauma you\u2019re going through, there\u2019s a wee bit of your brain that\u2019s like, \u2018Isn\u2019t this fascinating?\u2019\u201d Every time I interview a famous person I leave feeling slightly high and slightly sad, because to enter their fabulous world also, inevitably, means you see the shadow of their cage. The imposed disconnect, for instance. And the constant smiling and the many locks. Clarke was catapulted to extreme fame during a period when she nearly lost her mind. She started to find gifts outside her door, from one of many stalkers. One, she says, is extremely unwell, another extremely mean. \u201cThe stalker stuff is just horrible because, as a single lady walking around town, I already feel like I\u2019m being followed.\u201d These stalkers believe they\u2019re having a relationship with her, \u201cwhich is confusing, because having a relationship with people I don\u2019t know is a big part of what I signed up for. I care about what art does to people. But it carries with it a responsibility, and when you leave your front door you take that with you. And it\u2019s a difficult path to navigate. Because sometimes,\u201d and she\u2019s talking about fans now, the line between the two often being blurred, \u201cyou get grabbed physically and your instincts kick in. When you see shock being registered on someone else\u2019s face, you\u2019re like, \u2018Where\u2019s the danger?\u2019 And then you realise, oh, it\u2019s me \u2013 I\u2019m the danger.\u201d Her fanbase is due to change shortly, as she maps out her career without dragons. Clarke\u2019s new film is Last Christmas and is based on the Wham! song. While it is a box-office hit, reviews have been\u2026 mixed. \u201cThe kind of bad,\u201d said Rolling Stone, \u201cthat falls somewhere between finding a lump of coal in your stocking and discovering one painfully lodged in your rectum.\u201d It threatens to become a cult classic. Reader, I loved it. Clarke plays a woman whose messy life, it becomes clear, is partly a result of recent illness. \u201cI was able,\u201d she says darkly, \u201cto bring a lot to the role.\u201d There is a romantic twist, a twist so gooey it may cause diabetes in vulnerable audiences, but there is a second twist, in that this film (co-written by Emma Thompson) could prove to be the most effective piece of anti-Brexit propaganda of the festive season. Clarke (with Thompson as her mother) plays the youngest of a family of first-generation immigrants, dealing with the fallout of the referendum. \u201cWe filmed a scene of a hate crime,\u201d Clarke says, a scene on a London bus where a couple are told to go back to where they came from. \u201cAnd Emma said, \u2018Come on, let\u2019s be honest: haven\u2019t we all witnessed something similar?\u2019\u201d She loved working on this film, in part because of the women in charge, \u201cwho recognised that we all had a life outside this movie. You don\u2019t have to have a vagina to do that, but the difference lay in that slight... lack of patriarchy?\u201d And in part because of the intersection between entertainment and what she describes as \u201cmeaning\u201d. Something she continues to search for, albeit with regular disclaimers of privilege, and embarrassment. \u201cThe world is scary at the moment, both politically and environmentally. You have politicians pushing people to the absolute limits of their left versus right parameters, and the middle ground that we were all living in before is now wasteland, because both sides are life or death. It feels so much more polarised and extreme than ever. You\u2019ve got 33-year-olds like me asking, \u2018Should I bring kids into this world? If I do, what will that kid feel like?\u2019 It feels frightening, consistently. And I\u2019m not alone. I\u2019m leaning hard on Bake Off right now.\u201d But the fear has made her reassess her work, post-Game of Thrones. \u201cEntertainment is about taking you outside of yourself for a second, which is largely what I think the success of Game of Thrones was. People wanted to see something familiar, but also have that level of separation, through dragons and magic. Escapism is what lots of people go to art for. So, if we can cherry-pick stories to tell people in a shitty time, I\u2019d like to give them something really good. It could make them feel better, or less alone, or make them realise there\u2019s something outside of their front door that they should care about.\u201d She takes a sharp breath. \u201cYou know, I spent a lot of time being like, \u2018What I do is all bullshit. I\u2019m completely selfish, a total narcissist.\u2019 And then\u2026\u201d And then the world hit her at a great speed, and she emerged into this new adulthood, and 10 years crawled over her like glittering rats. \u201cAnd then I realised what it was for. I help provide relief. And that\u2019s worth something, especially now. Right?\u201d It takes a second before I realise she is waiting for an answer. \u201cRight,\u201d I say, reassuringly. \u201cRight.\u201d Last Christmas is in cinemas nationwide now Stylist Hope Lawrie; makeup by Lynsey Alexander at Streeters using Lanc\u00f4me; hair by Ken O\u2019Rourke at Premier Hair and Makeup using Charles Worthington Volume &amp; Bounce Body Booster Mousse; shot at Chesterton Road at beachstudios.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false}}}
