When overnight leader Sean O'Hair got his round under way he was still three shots ahead of the field on eight under with only a handful of players managing to break par. But that lead was instantly cut to two as playing partner Jason Gore birdied the opening hole. Fellow American Hunter Mahan was also offering something of a chase, moving to five under for the tournament after three birdies in his opening four holes. World number one Tiger Woods, a five-time winner at Bay Hill, began at three under par but bogeyed his opening hole, while world number five Padraig Harrington bogeyed the second to slip to one under. Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell was three over after eight holes having started his round on level par. England's Justin Rose had started brightly with birdies at the third and fifth only to record five bogeys and just one further birdie from the ninth to the 16th, ending with a bogey and a round of 73. Masters champion Trevor Immelman posted a 71 to finish five over while fellow South African Retief Goosen, who crept into the weekend on the cut mark at five over, carded a 72. English duo Brian Davis and Oliver Wilson had a day to forget. Davis fired a 76 to slip to 10 over while Wilson was eight over for his round after 12 holes, his day unravelling in spectacular fashion with three bogeys and a quadruple bogey in the space of four holes. The outlook for Sunday was not promising with rain and thunderstorms forecast for the morning meaning organisers were planning a return to three-man groups and a two-tee start."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
