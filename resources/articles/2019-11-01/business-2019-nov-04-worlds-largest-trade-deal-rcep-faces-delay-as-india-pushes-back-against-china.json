The 16-country Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership \u2013 known as the RCEP \u2013 would be the world\u2019s largest when operational, spanning India to New Zealand, including 30% of global GDP and half of the world\u2019s people. But resistance from India \u2013 concerned about a flood of cheap mass-produced Chinese goods hurting small businesses in its economy \u2013 appears set to cruel hopes of finalising the pact at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Bangkok, where members of the 10-nation bloc have been joined by the leaders of powerful observer nations India and China for the East Asia Summit. On a bilateral level, the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, has met the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, on the sidelines of the Bangkok meeting, offering to help get the China-Australia relationship \u201con the right track\u201d. \u201cWe are ready to work with the Australian side to keep our relationship on the right track, deepen our mutual trust, and jointly maintain regional and global peace,\u201d Li told Morrison. He said he wanted to expand business links and improve \u201cpeople-to-people exchange\u201d. \u201cThis is to the benefit of both sides. We hope our relations will move in the direction of steady and sound growth.\u201d Sino-Australian relationship have been scarred by a number of long-running issues, including the detention of the Australian citizen Yang Hengjun, human rights abuses inside China, the militarisation of the South China Sea, and allegations of foreign interference in politics, business and education. Inflaming these has been an increasingly uncompromising rhetoric from politicians and ministers on both sides. Morrison told Li that Australia \u201cgreatly appreciates\u201d its relationship with China, its largest trading partner. \u201cThis is an opportunity, among others, to talk about that relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cLike you, I feel very strongly and am committed to improving that relationship and ensuring we realise its full potential.\u201d The RCEP, of which Australia has been a key supporter over years of uneven negotiation, is essentially complete, save for the objections of one member, understood to be India. \u201cMost market access negotiations have been completed and the few outstanding bilateral issues will be resolved by Feb 2020,\u201d said a draft agreement obtained by Agence France-Presse. The statement said the text of all 20 chapters was now complete \u201cpending the resolution of one\u201d member. But it said all members were \u201ccommitted to sign the RCEP\u201d next year in Vietnam, which will take over the Asean chair. The RCEP will cover the 10 countries of Asean \u2013 Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam \u2013 plus India, Japan, China, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Delhi is worried that small businesses across India would be hard hit by an unrestrained influx of cheap Chinese goods. It is also protectionist by instinct, resistant to the removal of agricultural tariffs impacting upon the country\u2019s small-scale farmers. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, reportedly repeated his country\u2019s concerns during talks with Asean leaders on Sunday. Speaking in Bangkok, Australia\u2019s trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said the final negotiations on trade deals were always complicated. \u201cAustralia goes into this trying to achieve the most ambitious agreement possible but realistic that we have, across the 16 countries, huge development differences, huge population differences, huge differences in the system of government and cultures of those countries,\u201d he said. \u201cBridging those divides is probably the biggest challenge that\u2019s ever been faced in terms of a trade agreement being signed and sealed around the world.\u201d The RCEP will be negotiated further at a summit on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit on Monday. with agencies"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
