In 2017 the prime minister decided to call what would prove to be a disastrous snap general election while on a walking holiday in Wales. Speaking to journalists en route to her last major international summit, in Japan, May said noticing the pace at which ice had receded over time in the Swiss mountains had inspired her recent announcement that the UK would target net zero carbon emissions by 2050. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to be going to the G20. I\u2019m going to be talking about the importance of us continuing to work together cooperatively, and us working with international partners,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the issues we\u2019ll be talking about climate change, and I\u2019m very pleased to say that when we get off the plane our net zero target for 2050 will have entered law in the UK. And that\u2019s obviously important to ensure that we\u2019re not contributing to climate change in the future. \u201cJust as a small example of why this is important: as you know, Philip and I go walking, not just in Wales but also in Switzerland, and there\u2019s a particular place we go to where over the last decade you can see the glacier retreating quickly \u2013 and this has brought home to me the importance of climate change.\u201d She said she would urge other leaders to follow the UK\u2019s example. \u201cThe G20 represents 80% of emissions, so actually it\u2019s not just about what the UK does, it\u2019s about what we can do together. So I\u2019m going to be taking a message to the other leaders about the importance of them following the UK\u2019s lead and acting on this issue.\u201d The surprise net zero plan was one of a string of policies announced by Downing Street in recent weeks, as May seeks to secure some legacy beyond failing to deliver Brexit. The climate pledge met with scepticism among some of her cabinet colleagues. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said that it could cost up to \u00a31tn in lost economic output by the time it was met. But May was keen to respond to the increasing public concern about the climate emergency after the school strikes and a visit to the UK by the climate activist Greta Thunberg. The Treasury and No 10 have also clashed over whether the prime minister can announce a funding boost for education before she leaves office, along the lines of the \u00a320bn-a-year settlement already agreed for the NHS. Hammond is concerned that the Conservatives risk squandering what he regards as their hard-won reputation for careful management of the public finances. But both remaining leadership candidates have made a series of costly promises to cut taxes and increase spending. May was speaking en route to the G20 summit in Osaka at which rising tensions in the Middle East are also expected to be on the agenda. She stressed the importance of Iran abiding by its commitments under the JCPOA, the international nuclear treaty that Donald Trump has pulled out of but which the UK, France and Germany have sought to keep alive. \u201cWe have been actively working with others, notably with our French and German colleagues, to do everything we can to ensure the maintenance of the JCPOA. Now obviously, as part of that, it\u2019s important that Iran abides by its commitments,\u201d May said. She added: \u201cWe do have, as the UK, a difference of opinion with the United States in relation to the JCPOA. As you know, the US withdrew from the JCPOA. We continue to believe in the importance of maintaining that nuclear deal.\u201d Asked about Trump\u2019s admission that he had come close to ordering airstrikes against Iran, May said: \u201cI think what we need to see in relation to Iran at the moment is a de-escalation of the tensions that we\u2019ve seen in that region.\u201d Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cIf a day is a long time in politics, a decade is a very long time for the PM to be aware of devastating climate change that she admits to seeing with her own eyes. \u201cWe know about the dangers of hitting 1.5\u00b0C of global warming so it\u2019s incumbent on any leader to do everything possible, as quickly as possible, to get ahead of this massive risk: there\u2019s no such thing as going too fast in mitigating climate chaos.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
