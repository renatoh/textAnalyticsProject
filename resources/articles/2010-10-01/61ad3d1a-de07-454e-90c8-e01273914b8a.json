After strong winds, there can still be pickings worth gathering at Druridge Bay. Small pieces of timber, impregnated with salt, burn well on our living room fire. Autumn is here now, and trees surrounding our large field are already showing a few drooping skeletal heads of dead leaves. There are birds and several rabbits in the hedgerows and when I walk down the field they are more tolerant of my presence now because, unfortunately, I am no longer accompanied by a dog. Last week one covey of young game birds hopped about only 10 yards ahead of me for several minutes before, reluctantly, flying on to the muddied ploughed field over the neighbouring hedge. I support the two remaining weekly buses which come through our village to take passengers to Morpeth or Hexham. The drivers of these buses are country men and always crawl to a halt if there is a party of dithering birds, usually partridges or pheasants, pecking grit on the tarmac ahead of them. The hedgerows are now choked with autumn rosebay willowherb and dying wild roses, and there are not many cattle or sheep enjoying the freedom of the fields. Many farm animals now spend more time confined in byres during winter months. We have enjoyed early apples and pears: these fruits should be eaten soon after picking as they may not keep well. Later varieties, harvested before the first frosts, can be stored into winter months. Always pick apples and pears carefully to avoid bruising and put them, if possible, on a tray lined with newspaper in a well ventilated sheltered place. Should any of the fruits begin to show signs of rot, remove them immediately."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
