Amber Guyger faces a lengthy prison sentence after a jury found her guilty of the murder of Botham Jean in Dallas on 6 September last year \u2013 a verdict Jean family attorneys hailed as a significant moment in the battle to hold police accountable. Guyger is white. Jean was black. Guyger is the first Dallas police department officer to be convicted of murder since the 1970s, the Dallas Morning News reported. Standing in a packed hallway outside the courtroom in Dallas, attorney Lee Merritt told reporters the ruling was \u201ca huge victory not only for the family of Botham Jean, but as his mother, Allison, told us a moment ago, this is a victory for black people in America\u201d. He said: \u201cIt is a signal that the tide is going to change here, [that] police officers are going to be held accountable for their actions.\u201d Merritt said the community should not have had to wait \u201con pins and needles\u201d for the conviction of someone who killed a man who was \u201ccompletely non-aggressive, sitting at home eating a bowl of ice cream and someone barged into his home and shot him to death.\u201d He added: \u201cThis should have been automatic, anticipated, expected, but it is extremely rare. From this day forward we are pushing so that it\u2019s not rare.\u201d The jury began deliberating on Monday afternoon and reached a verdict on Tuesday morning, with sentencing to follow. Guyger pleaded not guilty. In Texas, murder usually carries a sentence of five to 99 years in prison but Judge Tammy Kemp had allowed the jury to consider convicting the lesser charge of manslaughter. Jurors, however, decided that Guyger had committed murder. Ben Crump, a lawyer for the Jean family, told NBC local news, said: \u201cThank God. Finally America saw the humanity of an unarmed black man who was killed in an unjustifiable way and they returned a verdict that is befitting the criminal, cowardly act of this woman, killing Botham Jean in his own apartment.\u201d Crump added in a press conference: \u201cThis is a precedent now that will go forth across America for equal justice for everybody.\u201d He said the incident underscored the need for better police training and that the verdict was for \u201cso many unarmed black and brown human beings all across America\u201d who died in interactions with police. Jean, a 26-year-old accountant, had settled down on his couch to watch television and eat some vanilla ice cream when Guyger entered his home. She claimed she mistakenly believed it was hers and thought he was an intruder. Kemp controversially allowed the jury to consider whether Guyger\u2019s conduct could be justified under Texas\u2019s so-called \u201ccastle doctrine\u201d. Expanded in 2007, it is comparable to \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws in other states and allows a civilian to use deadly force if he or she \u201creasonably believes \u2026 [it] is immediately necessary\u201d in certain circumstances, such as during a burglary. Though Jean was on his own property and Guyger the intruder, seemingly inverting the intent of the law, her attorneys argued she made a \u201cmistake of fact\u201d when she went to the wrong home, making her subsequent conduct reasonable. They said she was tired after a long day and many other residents had found themselves at the wrong unit in the past because signage was unclear and floors looked similar. \u201cShe made a series of horrible mistakes,\u201d Toby Shook, one of her attorneys, said. \u201cThe law recognises that mistakes can be made.\u201d Prosecutors said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d to believe the 31-year-old\u2019s \u201ccommando-style\u201d behaviour was reasonable, especially given her training as a police officer and status as a more than four-year veteran of the department. They noted that Guyger failed to retreat and call for back-up, questioned the veracity of her claim to have given Jean verbal commands before firing, and pointed out that after calling 911 she appeared to provide only limited medical assistance as Jean, who was from St Lucia, lay dying from a chest wound. Rather than feeling tired, prosecutors alleged, she was distracted because she had been \u201csexting\u201d a colleague. Jean had a bright red mat in front of his door that ought to have been impossible to miss. Guyger \u2013 who was fired by Dallas police \u2013 wept while testifying. \u201cI was scared this person inside my apartment was going to kill me,\u201d she said. \u201cI ask God for forgiveness and I hate myself every single day. I feel like a piece of crap.\u201d In closing statements, Jason Fine, a prosecutor, called most of her testimony \u201cgarbage\u201d. Fine said Jean did not act in a threatening manner, but started to stand up \u201clike a normal reasonable person who has somebody busting into his home, and before he can even get up he is shot dead in his own home. \u201cKilling this man was unnecessary and unreasonable from start to finish.\u201d Special security measures were put in place during the trial. Jean\u2019s death sparked protests and demands for justice from activists who cited it as one of a long line of racially charged shootings by a police department that lacks accountability. Though she was off duty, Guyger was still in uniform and used her service weapon when she encountered Jean. Critics of the department have also claimed Guyger was given preferential treatment. It emerged during the trial that the head of the Dallas Police Association told another officer to shut off an audio-visual recording system inside a patrol car so that he could have a private conversation with Guyger soon after the shooting. She still faces a civil lawsuit brought by Jean\u2019s family."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
