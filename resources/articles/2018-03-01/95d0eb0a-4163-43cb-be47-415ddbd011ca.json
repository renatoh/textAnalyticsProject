The Tottenham Hotspur manager, who watched his team lose 2-1 for a 4-3 aggregate exit, said he saw Giuseppe Marotta in the tunnel during the interval and that the Juventus chief executive had complained to the Polish official, Szymon Marciniak. Marotta and the rest of the Juventus party were incensed at Marciniak\u2019s decision to ignore a stonewall penalty for Douglas Costa in the 17th minute, following a challenge from Jan Vertonghen. It is understood there were angry scenes and Marotta was not the only Juventus executive to confront Marciniak. Pochettino\u2019s assistant, Jes\u00fas P\u00e9rez, described how Marotta had left \u201cthree minutes before half-time\u201d to put himself in the way of the players, staff and officials. Before the teams emerged for the second half TV footage showed that four Juventus players continued the protest to Marciniak. Pochettino, who mentioned that he saw the Juventus owner, Andrea Agnelli, in the tunnel, said it was \u201ctwo games against this type of club \u2013 one on the pitch; one outside it\u201d. He felt his team had more than held their own in footballing terms but they were second best on the other side. Pochettino did not criticise Juventus for their efforts to gain an edge; rather, he said they had given Tottenham \u201ca massive lesson in how to behave\u201d. \u201cWe saw how the sporting director [meaning Marotta] put pressure on the referee at half-time,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cHe was in the corridor. They were complaining about the penalty. Maybe we need to learn how we put pressure on the referee. In this type of game every minimal detail can help you to win.\u201d Pochettino was asked whether the Juventus defender, Andrea Barzagli, should have been sent off for stamping on Heung-min Son in the 33rd minute. \u201cWe complained,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWe put pressure on the referee but it was easy for the referee to manage us because we were very nice people, trying to help to play a game. In this situation, with experience, you have more possibilities to achieve all that you want. That is another game. It\u2019s not only the game playing football.\u201d Pochettino felt that the second half \u2013 which his team had started 1-0 up \u2013 featured \u201cmany fouls that weren\u2019t fouls\u201d. He said Juventus had increased the tempo by starting \u201cthe game with the ball moving, players inside the box on goal-kicks \u2013 in the Premier League, this doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d He added: \u201cJuventus are specialists because they have the habit to win and the habit to put pressure on the referee. It\u2019s a club with a culture to try to do everything to help the team. It\u2019s the small details and I believe those details can help us to achieve what we want.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
