Sir Edward Troup, who was executive chair of HMRC from 2016 until January 2018, said whichever party won the general election on 12 December should abolish the \u201centrepreneurs\u2019 relief\u201d applied to capital gains tax (CGT). Troup\u2019s intervention on Wednesday came in response to a Guardian report on Tuesday showing thousands of the country\u2019s richest people were exploiting the policy to pay as little as 10% tax on billions of pounds\u2019 worth of capital gains. \u201cThis inequity would be almost entirely eliminated by the abolition of entrepreneurs\u2019 relief,\u201d Troup, who had been a commissioner of HMRC since 2012, tweeted. \u201cIt gives \u00a32bn CGT savings every year to those who have already made their gains and provides no incentive for real entrepreneurship.\u201d Troup later said that entrepreneurs\u2019 relief \u2013 which reduces the tax bill on capital gains from 20% to 10% \u2013 had a \u201cminimal impact on encouraging entrepreneurship in the UK\u201d. He suggested that some of the thousands of people who applied for the relief were not in fact entrepreneurs, and that even if the break was being taken up by real entrepreneurs it was \u201cnot the best way to spend [government] money\u201d. Troup said: \u201cThe point of entrepreneurs\u2019 relief is that it rewards you when you make a lot of money. There are lots of things getting in the way of people becoming great entrepreneurs in this country, but the fear of tax on future gains is not one of them. \u201cAbsolutely, the government should be helping [entrepreneurs] set up great businesses here, but the idea that having to pay more tax at the end is preventing their inventing things is nonsense.\u201d Troup, who is now a consultant at McKinsey, said there was a \u201cvery strong case for [whichever party won the election] to ramp down entrepreneurs\u2019 relief immediately\u201d. Business owners can qualify for entrepreneurs\u2019 relief, under which they can pay just 10% CGT, when they sell all or part of a company, up to \u00a310m. The standard CGT rate is 20%. This compares with the 40% income tax rate on salaries from \u00a350,001 up to \u00a3150,000. HMRC data shows that 9,000 people paid just \u00a35.1bn in tax on \u00a333.7bn of capital gains income, in the latest financial year available. That works out at an average tax rate of 14.8%, lower than than the basic rate income tax of 20% which people pay on salaries of between \u00a312,501 and \u00a350,000. People recording gains of more than \u00a31m each accounted for 62% of all capital gains receipts in the 2017-18 financial year, the latest available data set. The data also shows that the existence of the tax break cost the government \u00a32.2bn in lost taxes collected in the 2017/18 financial year. A Treasury spokesperson said entrepreneurs\u2019 relief was now a party political matter in the run-up to the election but declined to comment. On Tuesday the Treasury said: \u201cWe want a tax system where everyone pays their fair share, while also ensuring supporting investment and growth.\u201d The Conservative party did not respond to requests for comment. On Wednesday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, launched the Tories\u2019 election campaign with a pledge to create a \u201chigh-wage, high-skill, low-tax economy\u201d. \u201cWhen someone gets up at 5am to get their shop ready, when someone risks their savings on an idea or a new product, when someone has the guts to enter a new market, at home or abroad, we don\u2019t sneer at them,\u201d Johnson said in a column for the Daily Telegraph. Corbyn has promised that a Labour government would \u201cgo after\u201d super-rich people who exploited a \u201crigged system\u201d to benefit themselves at the expense of the many. The Labour party did not respond to requests for comment about whether or not it would act to scrap entrepreneurs\u2019 relief. The entrepreneurs\u2019 relief scheme was introduced in 2008, under Gordon Brown\u2019s Labour government. At first it was limited to \u00a31m per person, but the cap was increased several times and raised to \u00a310m in 2011, under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
