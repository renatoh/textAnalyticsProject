In living rooms throughout the country you could find proud mums and dads, and pretend mums and dads, purring with pleasure after Shaun Wright-Phillips scored the first England goal against Israel. He is that kind of boy. He brings out the maternal in all of us - even the blokiest of football blokes. Is there a player more loved in the modern game? Not loved solely because of his achievement, or his ability, but because of his transparent goodness. Here is a footballer with heart, soul and, whisper it, humility. So when he finally began to fulfil his potential for England, the nation melted. All popular footballers have nicknames. In most cases, we simply add an \"ee\" sound to the surname. So we have Crouchy, Coleys A and J, and Jamesy in the current England squad. Many players seem to have pre-empted their superstar status with surnames naturally ending in Y (Rooney, Terry, Barry) as if God knew they were going to be footballers so saved us the bother of nicknaming them. As for players who are admired but never adored, the name remains the same - Rio Ferdinand is never Ferdy, nor the Nevilles Nevo, and Owen is no Oweny despite all the goals. But the truly loved players do not simply get their surname reshaped, they get their first name lopped and chopped. There's only one Stevie G. It's true - mention Stevie in football and everybody knows who you are talking about. The only other first-namer in the England setup is Shauny. While we love Stevie for his achievements and model behaviour (the elder brother who has taken on and beaten the world while remaining true to his roots), we love Shauny in a different way. Shauny is the younger son who has struggled, and pulled through, struggled again and pulled through again - the little lad who has never given up when so many armchair naysayers gave up on him. He never knew his birth father, he was rejected by Nottingham Forest for being too small at 5ft 5in, he was racially abused on the pitch. When he made his debut for Manchester City fans thought he was the mascot. So short, so smiley, dancing down the pitch on legs that did a passable impression of arms, how could we not love him? Here was our very own pocket genius - Zola, Juninho and Shauny. But there was more to his loveability than his size. After all, football has had more than its share of little bastards - Dennis Wise and Billy Bremner to name but two. While so many top footballers have moved seamlessly from school to the deadening privilege of the Premier League, he has had to battle at every level. When he established himself in the City team, in the First Division, it took him a season to start scoring. When City settled in the Premiership the same happened again. When he made his debut for England he scored, and then was dropped. When he moved to Chelsea for \u00a321m, he couldn't do a thing right. Some City fans called him a heretic and said it served him right. But only a few. Many continued to wear their SWP shirts and share his agony. It was heartbreaking to watch him lose confidence by the week, to the point that he couldn't shoot, couldn't cross and when he ran with the ball you knew he was headed straight for the next defender's chest. He lost his place in the Chelsea team, and the England squad. From being the most entertaining footballer in the Premiership he became the forgotten man. As his adoptive father Ian Wright explained in the BBC studios on Saturday, between whooping for joy like a kid playing red indians, he was substituted whether he played well or badly. Wright said his lad had always needed hugs and always thrived on praise. (It should be compulsory for every footballing dad to come into the studio to explain what their lads are doing right and wrong.) There were rumours that Shauny was on his way to struggling West Ham or even worse back to City, which for him would have been the ultimate admission of failure. But still he kept a dignified silence, and fought for his place. This season, the magic has returned, and he is skinning defenders for fun. In his two-years at Chelsea, he has seen off Arjen Robben and Damien Duff, forced Joe Cole on to the bench, sprinted past Aaron Lennon in the race for an England place, and might well now deny David Beckham his 100th cap if he plays well tonight. Some achievement. But even more impressive in an age of gated properties and prickly prima donnas, he has remained the same Shauny of old. Well done son, I'm proud of you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
