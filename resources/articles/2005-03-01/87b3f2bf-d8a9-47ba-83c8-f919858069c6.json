Mr Howells told the Commons science and technology select committee that he suspected \"many millions of pounds\" were being spent on programmes to direct students into certain areas with very little evidence that they were effective. \"They [programmes] don't seem to be working,\" he said. \"There are a huge number of initiatives out there, some evidence-based. Others I wonder where they have come from.\" It was not possible to \"force people\" into science and maths, he told the committee, which is undertaking an inquiry into the state of science in universities following a series of degree course closures in chemistry, physics, maths and engineering. A survey of different initiatives undertaken by a colleague had already filled three volumes, Mr Howells told MPs. The government has been criticised for allowing universities to close science departments. However, Mr Howells said the problem was \"over provision\" and warned: \"It is going to be tremendously hard for the ship to change direction at this stage.\" Persuading young people to study science and maths was much more difficult than it seemed, he said. \"People have got to have a much clearer view of what they are going to do with their science degrees,\" Mr Howells told the MPs. Engineering graduates are being snapped up by legal and accountancy firms who \"like the way they think,\" he said. \"The obvious answer is to tell the engineering firms to pay them more and make it more attractive,\" he said. However, a spokesman for the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said trying to convince pupils to do science when they made their degree decisions was too late. He said the crucial period was at 12 or 13 years of age, which was when companies believed children were being turned off science: \"That's the most important time for schools to make it exciting.\" It is vital for British industry that the country produces sufficient numbers of science and mathematics graduates, according to the CBI. \"The idea that there are not good, well-paid careers in these fields is just wrong.\" Peter Cotgreave, the director of Save British Science, said a key weakness was the quality of careers advice given to school pupils. If students knew they wanted to be scientist it was straightforward, but most did not know what career to aim for, he said. \"They [students] are being told that if you do English, history or French you can become the next Jeremy Paxman, but advisers are not telling pupils that taking chemistry and maths degrees will get them well-paid, interesting jobs too,\" he said. Another reason why students rejected science and maths was the poor quality of teaching in schools. Dr Cotgreave said two-thirds of those teaching the physics element of science courses in secondary schools did not have a physics A-level themselves. \"How can they enthuse children about physics when they did not take it themselves at school,\" he asked. Earlier this month, Sir Howard Newby, the chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for England, told the committee that between 1999 and 2004 the number of students studying chemistry had fallen by more than 2,300, 2,263 in maths, 2,565 in engineering and 1,111 in biosciences. He said the funding council also believed that falling student demand must be tackled in schools, rather than propping up ailing departments. Since 1996, 28 universities have stopped offering chemistry degrees, according to the Royal Society of Chemistry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
