World football\u2019s governing body announced in May it had requested clarification from United and Juventus on every aspect of Pogba\u2019s \u00a389.3m move to Old Trafford. Fifa acted following allegations Pogba\u2019s agent, Mino Raiola, would earn \u20ac49m (\u00a341.3m) from the most expensive transfer in history. Reports based on extracts from documents and contracts relating to Pogba\u2019s move, revealed by the Football Leaks operation, alleged Raiola was paid \u20ac27m from Juventus, \u20ac19.4m by United and a further \u20ac2.6m paid by United on behalf of Pogba for negotiating his wage package. United said at the time they were relaxed about the investigation after offering Fifa all the relevant documents when the transfer was completed in August 2016. Fifa told ESPN on Tuesday: \u201cWe can confirm disciplinary proceedings have been opened against Juventus. We cannot comment further as proceedings are ongoing. We can confirm no disciplinary proceedings have been opened against Manchester United.\u201d Fifa is set to examine Raiola\u2019s agreement with the Serie A club to see if there is a breach of third-party ownership rules. Raiola admitted in an interview with the Financial Times last year that: \u201cJuventus was not the only owner of the player\u2019s rights.\u201d However, he recently dismissed suggestions he had \u201ccashed \u00a340m\u201d from Pogba\u2019s move as \u201cfake news\u201d and, during an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport, refused to confirm his slice of the deal. He said: \u201c\u20ac27m? I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s not an exact figure: maybe it\u2019s less but maybe it\u2019s even more.\u201d Agents are permitted to act for two sides to a transfer, and three in exceptional circumstances, as long as all parties are aware of it and agree. If Juventus are found guilty of wrongdoing, the Italian champions could be fined or handed a transfer ban."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
