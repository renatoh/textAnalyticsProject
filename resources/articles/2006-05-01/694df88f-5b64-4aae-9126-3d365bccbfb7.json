Don't invert this dish, though. Just serve it as a pie, with a big tub of clotted cream alongside. 100g unsalted butter 125g soft light brown sugar 150g plain flour 50ml calvados (or brandy) 5 sweet eating apples (preferably last year's Gala or Jonathan) Take half the butter and 50g of the sugar, and rub roughly into the flour. You don't want it too smooth: the odd lump of butter here and there makes the pastry around it go flaky while baking. Stir in the calvados, squeeze the mixture to a soft dough, then cover. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Peel the apples, halve them from top to bottom and spoon out the core. Put the remaining sugar and butter in a large, heavy-based frying pan, add 50ml water and heat slowly until the sugar dissolves. Boil until the sugar begins to turn a dark golden-brown and thickens to a slow, bubbling caramel - this will take about three minutes. Tip in the apples, remove the pan from the heat at once and very carefully (the caramel will be viciously hot) turn the apples until they are coated all over. Return the pan to the heat, let it bubble away for a minute, then carefully tip the caramel and apples into a 20cm round pie dish. Arrange them all higgledy-piggledy. On a floured surface, roll out the pastry to about 25cm in diameter, then lay this over the apples, tucking it in around the edge. Place on a tray to catch the drips and bake for 40 minutes. Let it cool a bit before serving."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
