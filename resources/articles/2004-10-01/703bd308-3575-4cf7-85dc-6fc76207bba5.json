One is with Jim McIngvale, the Texas furniture businessman who last year seemed to think that the $27m he had invested in the Tennis Masters Cup in Houston entitled him to cheer his fellow American even if the way in which he did it upset the other players. If Agassi is again to receive the benefits of Mattress Mac's adulation next month it would help if the 34-year-old prevented Tim Henman from justifying his top-seed status at the Masters Series here this week. That would earn Agassi 100 points and move him into the top eight who qualify for the year-end finals. On the evidence of a difficult 7-6, 6-4 win over Max Mirnyi, Agassi is still capable of doing that. He had not competed for six weeks since the US Open and had to cope with conditions that suited the big-serving Belarussian, the ball whipping through the thinner air so sharply that it took 19 tries before the best returner of serve in the world could win a point against Mirnyi's delivery. But after going a mini-break down in the tie-break and still sneaking it by seven points to five, Agassi changed to a different string tension and acquired more ball control. Eventually he even found time to lecture the umpire on how to calm down and to glare at one of the model-come-ball-girls who had incorrectly taken up a position alongside a colleague at the back of the court instead of at the net. \"It was difficult, to say the least, to concentrate on the ball but I suppose I had an advantage; I'm used to playing with my wife,\" Agassi said tongue in cheek but changing to serious mode immediately. \"You know I think it's important for our sport to understand its product clearly. And I'm not quite convinced it's part of our product.\" Henman makes his bow today, by which time he will not have competed for 24 days since the Davis Cup in Austria after which he was complaining of a bad back and shoulder. Such things make his form a little bit of an unknown quantity and could turn his opening match against the former French Open champion Albert Costa before a partisan crowd into an ordeal. Costa admits Henman is currently in a richer vein of form than he is. \"We have played each other a lot. I've beaten him and he's beaten me. He's in better form than I am but I can go out with nothing to lose.\" At the Zurich Challenge Venus Williams avenged her controversial exit from this year's Wimbledon with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Karolina Sprem. Williams's win marked the first meeting between the two players since that June encounter when Sprem was helped to victory by a mistake by the umpire Ted Watts, who awarded the 19-year-old Croatian an extra point during a second-set tie-break. At the Madrid Masters Spain's teenage Davis Cup hero Rafael Nadal cruised to a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Davide Sanguinetti. The German Tommy Haas, too, took advantage of the fast indoor court to claim a 6-4, 6-1 victory over the Belgian Xavier Malisse. Spain's Fernando Verdasco beat Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman 6-1, 6-2 and Taylor Dent of America beat Russia's Mikhail Youzhny 6-3, 6-2."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
