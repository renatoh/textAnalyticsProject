The joint committee on human rights recommended in our report last summer that the law be changed to allow post-charge questioning and, with appropriate safeguards, adverse inferences to be drawn from a refusal to answer. As the attorney general acknowledges, this would enhance human-rights protection because it would lessen the pressure for a further extension of the 28-day limit on detention without charge. The joint committee also recommended lifting the ban on the use of intercept evidence in court, as part of a package of measures to facilitate prosecution. The human rights-compatible way to counter the threat from terrorism is to remove unnecessary obstacles to prosecution and return to using the ordinary criminal process.
