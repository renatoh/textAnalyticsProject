For a man who had been bitten by a boa constrictor only a week before - in the Amazon, not Wiltshire - he certainly seemed at ease with himself and the world. In fact, he exuded an inner calm, something that our noisy group could hardly claim. \"That,\" said Max gently, \"was like a herd of buffaloes approaching.\" He looked up at the trees. \"Notice how the birds have all stopped singing?\" We stood in silence and slowly the birdsong resumed. \"I want you all to go into the woods,\" Max went on. \"Find a tree away from the others and sit down. You can scratch and fidget for 30 seconds, then you stop. Sit absolutely still. Empty your mind. Zone-in. Meditate. I'll call you in after 20 minutes.\" I took a grassy track that led away to the right, angling through tall oaks and then stands of smaller trees. After about 100 yards I cut to the right and sat down. Within two minutes I'd stopped scratching. My breathing slowed. A squirrel ran up to me. I came back into focus. My hearing had become super-sensitive. I could hear the wasps in the tree-tops, even a falling leaf as it tickled its way through the foliage to land on my knee. A pheasant stepped past me. I could have easily reached out and grabbed it, but I was stone-like, utterly still. I felt I would never move, that I could stay like this forever. I was becoming a part of the woods. Born in Zambia, Ian \"Max\" Maxwell worked in Kenya on poacher-defences, then later with the American special forces, the Shadow Wolves, a team entirely manned by Native Americans. On the Mexican border, they track drug smugglers and illegal immigrants. \"They taught me to track fast,\" he says of that period in his life. \"And treat the people we caught with compassion.\" Now living in Cornwall, he's become the man police turn to when there's a tricky murder enquiry in the woods, or a fugitive out there. He also runs Shadowhawk, a Devon-based company that teaches tracking to anyone who is interested. And that doesn't just mean men who prefer to wear camouflage. The chief instructors include Rhoda Watkins, who combines yoga and tracking. There are also courses for children. \"Tracking brings any environment alive,\" Max says, \"whether it's desert, jungle or a British back garden. Anyone can benefit from that. The zone-in is certainly a very moving experience.\" My own moment of ecstatic woodland appreciation had lasted well, but then Max's distant voice ended it: \"Come on in!\" We moved back quietly, without quick movements, and Max nodded. \"That's better - now you're ready to track.\" We divided into two groups and set off. I was with Max's colleague, Nick Mayell, who took us down to a stream and then along the bank. After a few yards he stopped and pointed out a shallow depression on a mud bank. \"Mink. Smaller print than an otter and the feet aren't webbed.\" He glanced around and spotted something else. \"A roe deer has crossed here.\" A small hoof print just over an inch across. We moved on another yard. \"Badger - oh, and a rat.\" This innocuous patch of woodland was suddenly rather interesting. These marks were the start of trails, each one a story we might follow. After our three-hour session was over, I asked him whether tracking was as good an experience in tame old England as it is in Africa? \"Absolutely,\" he said. \"Try the zone-in every day. Find a spot in a wood where you can be alone. Do the meditation, start tracking - it can change your life.\" Well, I have to admit, it was the first time I had sat still in a British wood for more than five minutes, and it had been a wonderful experience. So, I'm going to give it a try. The wilderness, I realise, doesn't have to be in Africa: there's one right on the doorstep. \u00b7 Shadowhawk (07815 120150, shadowhawk.co.uk) two-day, two-night foundation course \u00a3160pp. Survival skills in Hebrides Stay on Islay and take a choice of activities from a half-day family birdwatching trip to a five-day intensive survival course.
