No, please don't look over at that black person in the corner! I mean you, the white one! (Or, should I say, the hyphenated-British one?) That is, after all, what our Home Office minister has just suggested. While her boss, Charles Clarke, has been away on holiday, Hazel Blears has decided that giving us all double-barrelled identities would be a great idea, and would help to make everyone seem valued and included in our modern society. She's apparently been inspired by the US, where descriptions such as Irish-American, Italian-American and African-American have done so much to bring communities together in a big group-hug of brotherly love. Forget marginalisation and discrimination; forget alienation, and how it has helped turn some towards terrorism; all we need now is a neat little addition to our nationality and all our troubles will go far away. It's such a classic spin trick that New Labour's ideologues must have been delighted - although No 10 later backtracked and said the idea was not a proposal. Ms Blears heads a new government commission on how best to integrate minorities. It is, at least, an improvement on the traditional methods suggested for most non-white newcomers to this country: \"Oy - if you don't integrate we're gonna smash a brick through your window and stick dog shit though your letterbox!\" Actually, I did tell a little white lie earlier: according to the Times, which broke the story, \"it is unclear whether Irish, Scottish or Welsh people would be part of the exercise\". In fact, it's unclear whether English people would too - but I guess they forgot to ask that question. The problem is, the minute you start tugging on this idea, the whole thing starts to unravel. Britain is not America. Across the Atlantic, the double identities of the various minorities are a measure of their exclusion from society, not of their integration into it. If, during the US's mass-migration era, the Irish, Italians and Poles had been welcomed into the country and been able to gain a fair foothold, would they have established such tight-knit communities where identity became so strongly bonded over the generations? The hyphenation has merely provided a way for minorities to coexist in their separate ghettoes. Did the British, the Dutch, the Germans and the French who preceded them set such store in their national origins? No, they didn't have hyphens, they had ownership - they were Americans, the country was theirs, and all the immigrants who followed had to accept it. In fact, such was their arrogance that they bestowed a hyphenation on the original inhabitants whose land they'd stolen, now patronisingly labelled \"Native-American\". Despite being an island, Britain is also a nation of migrants and their descendants. Eight out of 10 of us have roots elsewhere. The only thing that marks some people out, rather than others, is skin colour. Five years ago, a Channel 4 documentary, Untold, interviewed a number of white Britons who were totally unaware that they had Asian or black family roots. They were people who'd never had to question their identity or nationality; the kind of people who'd have talked about \"immigrants\" coming into \"their\" country. The kind of people who'd today think of themselves as full-blooded Brits. So what would Blears call them? In her thinking, hyphenation is only for racial minorities - for \"British-Asians\", or \"Indian-British\". She didn't talk about \"French-British\", or \"British-Australian\", for example. No, according to her, they must be full-bloods; nor did she suggest, say, calling the leader of the opposition \"Jewish-British\", or \"Romanian-British\". In this act of omission, she serves only to reinforce the underlying contradictions that govern so much of Britain's thinking about race. Whites will not have their beliefs challenged - they can consider themselves \"British\", with no hyphens. In any case, most would reject out of hand any attempt to put a caveat on their own nationhood. For the rest - you can have a second-tier nationality, which accentuates that you're not like us. It is this double-standard that causes so much resentment among racial minorities - especially at a time when anyone who looks like a Muslim is being treated as the enemy within. Why are you questioning us, they ask. Will we always be outsiders? In turn, this forces minorities to examine their own sense of nationhood. When the Guardian surveyed Britain's racial minorities just before the general election, fewer than half considered themselves to be fully British. Interestingly, for all the current scare stories, the least-British group were not Asians, but Chinese. And age-wise, despite the fact that the younger generations are far more likely to have been born here, the least \"British\" were 25- to 34-year-olds; only among the over-55s did a majority feel British. This is worrying, because it shows that, despite the integration and mixing of races which has taken place over the years, we are somehow heading in the wrong direction. Our ideal should surely be an inclusive nationality that values the different perspectives that other cultures can bring, and doesn't force people to fit into strict Anglo-Saxon norms in order to be accepted. Ultimately, if we take the Blears route, nearly all of us should be hyphenated; but most of us can get away with pretending otherwise. For those who want to join in, but are unsure of their origins, maybe Ms Blears should come up with some new categories: man-British, woman-British; Arsenal-British, Chelsea-British; Yorkshire-British, Cornish-British; or, to tie in with the Sun's current campaign, what about Lawless-British? But if you don't want anything to do with this, and you're quite sure these lands have been yours since your forefathers' time, and you don't need to justify your right to a full stake in this society, then that's OK too. From now on, you're going to be Native-British. \u00b7 joseph.harker@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
