To prepare for a corporate takeover, they were put in the same classroom for a two-week training session. \u201cI took an instant dislike to him,\u201d says Christine. \u201cHe was a sales manager and I think he was trying to get his staff excited, but I thought he was an idiot.\u201d While her first impressions were bad, his were non-existent. \u201cI don\u2019t remember her being there at all,\u201d he admits. The following year, Christine was staying at a colleague\u2019s house in London after a flat purchase she was attempting fell through. A few weeks later, several people from the company were invited to stay, ahead of a big trade conference. \u201cI came down one morning and was horrified to find Robert there in his underwear. I had no idea what to do so I had to be polite,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were very nice underpants,\u201d he points out. The pair spent the next few days getting to know each other, as they travelled back and forth from the trade show. \u201cWe both liked to be on time, so we were the only ones up early,\u201d says Robert. It wasn\u2019t long before she realised she had been wrong about him. \u201cHe was funny and made me laugh. He was more intelligent than I had thought and had a serious side, too.\u201d Robert says he found his partner vivacious and clever. \u201cLove is a funny feeling. You either get it or you don\u2019t and we just got it.\u201d On the last night of the trade show they went for dinner with friends, where Christine told the group she would never date a smoker. \u201cI knew he was serious about me when he threw his cigarettes and lighter over his shoulder,\u201d she says. Despite being a heavy smoker at the time, he has never picked up a cigarette since. For the next two years, they had a long-distance relationship between London and Paris. \u201cIt was in the days where it cost about \u00a3600 for a return trip to France. Sometimes we\u2019d use the ferry to save costs,\u201d says Christine. Over time, they realised the lifestyle wasn\u2019t sustainable and she made the decision to leave her job and move to rural France. \u201cIt was in the days where men made more money, so it made more financial sense.\u201d The couple got married in their remote village in 1987. \u201dIt was the first foreign wedding they had ever had and the mayor who was meant to marry us was terrified,\u201d says Robert. \u201cWe had people from all over the world as our witnesses and I think he was afraid of saying the names wrong. On the day he pulled a sickie and sent his deputy.\u201d After the wedding, the couple endured a disastrous honeymoon to Crete. \u201cI was really ill and we had terrible storms,\u201d says Christine. \u201cI had a raging fever and couldn\u2019t leave the bed because the floor flooded.\u201d But they have laughed about it ever since, they say. While Robert worked full-time, Christine spent her time learning French. \u201cWe left the little village in 1988 and went to Lille before we settled in Lyon,\u201d says Christine. The couple remained in the city until 10 years ago, when Robert retired. They now live in the south of France, where their daughter plans to have her wedding. Robert has had cancer twice since they married, and is now going through chemotherapy. \u201cI just want to get rid of this bloody cancer and get back to doing the things we enjoy again,\u201d he says. Christine says her husband \u201cnever gets angry\u201d and they don\u2019t argue. \u201cI love that he\u2019s able to differentiate between what\u2019s really important and what isn\u2019t.\u201d Robert agrees: \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve faced health challenges, we\u2019re also very lucky in many ways.\u201d France is currently in lockdown. \u201cWe usually love going out for meals, so we are missing that,\u201d says Christine. \u201cBut we are making the best of things right now by lighting candles and enjoying cosy nights in. We just love each other\u2019s company.\u201d \u2022 Want to share your story?
