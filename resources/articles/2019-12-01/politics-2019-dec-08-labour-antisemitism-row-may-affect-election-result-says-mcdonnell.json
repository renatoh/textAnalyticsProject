In a BBC One interview on Sunday morning, John McDonnell apologised to the Jewish community for \u201cthe suffering we\u2019ve inflicted on them\u201d. He added: \u201cI say to them, we\u2019re doing everything possible and we are going to learn more lessons and we want to be the shining example of anti-racism that the Labour party should be.\u201d Asked if he thought antisemitism in the party would be partly to blame if Labour lost Thursday\u2019s general election, he said: \u201cI worry that this has had its effect. We\u2019ve done everything that I think we can possibly do. We\u2019ve apologised to the Jewish community \u2026 We\u2019ve always got to learn lessons, of course we have, all political parties. Because it isn\u2019t just the Labour party.\u201d He added: \u201cI hope \u2026 having gone through this horrible, horrible period, we come out of it now actually showing respect to the Jewish community and tackling this issue and enabling the Labour party to tackle antisemitism in our wider society.\u201d His comments came after a leak of documents from Labour\u2019s disciplinary department to the Sunday Times, which included a recording of an official complaining that more than 130 cases were outstanding even though the majority were reported to the party 18 months ago and one had been on the books for more than three years. The cases included members likening Jewish people to killer viruses, labelling them \u201cbent nose manipulative liars\u201d and calling for the \u201cextermination of every Jew on the planet\u201d. It reportedly took 10 months for the party to expel a member in Nottingham who wrote that \u201cJews represent a viral infection that need to be completely eliminated\u201d and said he wanted the \u201ccomplete extinction of all Jews\u201d. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday morning, McDonnell said it was his understanding that the number of outstanding cases was \u201cwell below\u201d the 136 reported. \u201cIt was a small number, but I don\u2019t care how many it was,\u201d he said. \u201cOne antisemite is too many, and what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve started kicking them out in numbers. The reports this morning, that I saw in the papers, cited a number of examples. Those people have been expelled or suspended. They\u2019ve been done.\u201d McDonnell said he had previously made clear he was angry because the Labour party \u201cweren\u2019t quick enough or ruthless enough\u201d. \u201cThe new procedures are dealing with that and that report today doesn\u2019t take that into account,\u201d he said. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) launched an official inquiry into antisemitism in the Labour party in May and is due to report next year. The final submissions on behalf of the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) to the inquiry was leaked to the media on Friday, including 70 sworn testimonies from current and former staffers, and concluding that the party was institutionally antisemitic. The issue of racism in the two main parties has dominated this election campaign, with Boris Johnson also coming under fire for racist and Islamophobic comments he and his party\u2019s candidates have previously made. The Guardian revealed on Friday that at least four ministers had gone on election campaigning trips to endorse Tory candidates who had, among other things, argued that Muslims had divided loyalties and blamed immigrants for bringing HIV to Britain. The Conservative party also announced on Saturday that it was investigating three parliamentary candidates over antisemitism. One shared a video with an image implying that the billionaire George Soros, who is Jewish, controls the EU, while another asked whether a Jewish journalist was more loyal to Israel than to Britain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
