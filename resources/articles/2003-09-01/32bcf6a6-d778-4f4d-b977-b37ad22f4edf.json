That is because, impressive though Beckham's league debut for Real Madrid was, the Posh 'n' Becks moment I really wanted to write about was in the News of the World's serialisation of his book (\"I'm writing an autobiography, Victoria.\" \"That's nice, David. What's it about?\"), and, according to the legend at the foot of each of the 11 pages of extracts, their lawyers are watching me. If those lawyers turn out to be poetry-quoting Rumpole of the Bailey types, or even slightly flaky Cherie Blair types, I am inclined not to worry too much, but my feeling is - and this may be sheer irrational prejudice - that News International probably employs chaps who operate more on the lines of those darkly uncompromising lawyers in the South that John Grisham writes about, or possibly the Corleone family's legal representatives. But, what the heck, I don't expect they read the Guardian anyway. I was fascinated by the details of David and Victoria's second date, during which they were sitting in a car park somewhere, when Victoria \"reached across to the glove compartment and pulled out a sprig of aloe vera.\" (Copyright News of the World, 2003. Will that do, boys?) David apparently had a cut finger, on which his new girlfriend rubbed the aloe vera. Clearly, this aloe vera is powerful stuff, because the very next day Becks sent some roses and a Prada handbag round to Victoria's place. This, more than anything for me, demonstrates what a sweet new man His Beckness is. Thinking back to my own days as a single man, I also went on one or two dates that culminated in a parked car, and I have to say - and I do not consider myself to be too much of a sexist pig - that if some young hotsy had climbed all over me to get to the glove compartment, and all I ended up with was a finger rub, she would not have been opening the door to the man from Interflora first thing. For me, the presence of the aloe vera alone would have set alarm bells ringing. What kind of woman, I should have asked myself, carries around supplies of exotic plants that can neither be eaten nor smoked? The answer, I fear, would not have been in her favour. Becks, on the other hand, was prepared to give this plant-toting weirdo a fair hearing, showing a commendable open-mindedness that will stand him in good stead in his new life in Spain. His debut will undoubtedly have boosted the audience for La Liga on Sky Sports on Saturday, which was one of those evenings when the Sky subscription seemed worth every penny; providing, if nothing else, an escape from the talent shows on terrestrial TV, where desperate wannabes are given way more airtime than their questionable abilities warrant - by which, of course, I mean the judges. Commentary on the Real Madrid-Real Betis match was a shade more Beckscentric than La Liga purists might wish, but that is a minor niggle. It was the kind of entertaining, open game La Liga is noted for, but with the fascinating Beckham sub-text. My feeling was, looking at close-ups of some of the great man's new team-mates, that Becks may find, despite his goal and committed performance, there is more work to be done before he is entirely accepted by his fellow superstars. Once or twice, they seemed to leave him deliberately stewing on the wing when they might have passed to him. Or am I reading too much into a little body language and a few facial expressions? If so, I am not alone. Des Lynam, on The Premiership, quoted the passage from Beckham's book serialisation (copyright etc.etc.), in which Becks says he knew Ferguson had fallen out of love with him when, on watching a re-run of the Man United - Real Madrid Champions League tie on TV, he noted the chilling expression on his manager's face after a Becks free-kick went over the bar. Watching the moment again on The Premiership, it was clear, as Des said, that Ferguson's expression was simple frustration at United's failure to get back in the match. The manager-player dynamic at Old Trafford is a wacky business all right, but sadly I do not have the time for detailed analysis now. I am too busy trying to work out what Sir Bobby Robson was on about in his post-match interview on Saturday. Robson, this week's holder of the Glenn Hoddle memorial award for Premiership manager under most pressure, came up with the following solution to Newcastle's current plight: \"We're in a dog fight, and the fight in the dog will get us out of trouble... We are solid behind each other, and through being solid we will get out of trouble, and if that fails, then we will be in trouble, but that's not the situation here. We'll all get in the same rowing boat, and we'll all pick up an oar, and we'll row the boat.\" Why do I feel there will be very few Newcastle fans saying, \"Well, that's all right then?\" \u00b7 Martin Kelner's book When Will I Be Famous (BBC Books, \u00a3 7.99) has not been bought for one million pounds by News International. His lawyers are asleep. martin@kelner.demon.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
