He did not achieve the final goal, and the world should now come to grips with that unfinished noble mission by reviving the momentum of the Arab-Israeli peace process. Like it or not, for good or for bad, that means coming to grips with the momentum of President George Bush's true commitment to fostering Arab-Israeli peace and a Palestinian state ... \"The race is on between those that want a negotiated, fair peace for all concerned and those that would continue fighting and killing for generations. If extremist militants on both sides prevail, the terrible impact will spread far beyond Israel and Palestine. All elements for progress toward a fair peace are in place, including Palestinian and Israeli majorities that favour a negotiated settlement, a parallel pan-Arab consensus, active European support, and an international community ... that is eager to assist the process. The external American catalyst has often proved fickle ... This is a rare real opportunity to correct past mistakes.\" Ahmad Y Majdoubeh Jordan Times, November 12 \"We cannot rule out the likelihood of the four coming years of the Bush administration being an exact replica of the past four years. What should be done then? ... \"One answer for what should be done to get America involved more seriously, however, could come from the European - especially the British - side ... \"Europe and America are not on great terms right now ... A reconciliation is the only logical course to follow in the days ahead, and it is essentially America that will be trying to make it up to the Europeans. There is opportunity for Palestinians and Arabs here. Through a campaign of intense, smart diplomacy, they could make a satisfactory solution to the Palestine question (at least America's serious commitment and involvement) part of the reconciliation deal, especially since the Europeans do care (much more so than the Americans) about finding a solution to this problem.\" Arab News Editorial, Saudi Arabia, November 12 \"All men of good will would remember the sufferings of the Palestinians and the justice of their aspirations. But, once the moment of grief is gone, the new Palestinian leadership should move quickly to revive the stalled peace process and prevent the imposition of a unilateral Israeli solution with the Gaza plan as its prologue. \"As Mr Bush has said, we now have new opportunities for peacemaking. These opportunities must not be wasted. The radical elements that are waiting in the wings, both in Israel and the occupied territories, to kill all chance of peace must not be allowed to seize the initiative. The best way to remember Abu Ammar [Arafat] is to work to achieve his dream of an independent Palestinian state, living in peace and harmony with its neighbours.\" Ephraim Sneh Haaretz, Israel, November 12 \"The opportunity that has been created with Arafat's death cries out for swift, courageous and intelligent exploitation ... There is need for a practical plan of action with a good chance of success. \"The simplest thing to do, a step the success of which will bring about a substantial change in the situation, is a cooperative and coordinated implementation of Israel's exit from the Gaza Strip and northern Samaria. In other words - handing over the Gaza Strip to a responsible and functioning Palestinian government ... Neither this plan nor any other is sacred. The important thing is that the two governments immediately engage in practical discussions on how to carry out the security and economic aspects of the disengagement. Success in Gaza will bring an end to the war and will serve as the corridor for returning to the road map peace plan. We must not miss this historic opportunity; we must restore hope.\" Jerusalem Post Editorial, November 12 \"Pessimists suspect that at the end of the day, Arafat's passing will prove to have changed little in the broader scheme of things. Moreover, the travails and tribulations of the past 11 years have taught Israelis, the hard way, that optimism can be bad for their health ... Israel for now has little choice but to follow events rather than try to shape them, since the choices at stake are entirely the Palestinians' to make. \"This is not the first time the Palestinians are faced with an opportunity to reinvent their history. In the past seven decades at least five such opportunities emerged, the very opportunities which Abba Eban memorably remarked the Palestinians always made sure to miss ... The big question now, therefore, is whether the post-Arafat leadership will finally resort to construction and harmony, or remain addicted to destruction and confrontation. Should it opt for the former, it can count on finding an Israeli populace whose eagerness to give peace the chance it demands equals the determination with which it is giving terror the fight it deserves. The choice is all the Palestinians'.\" New York Post Editorial, November 12 \"Is there really cause for optimism, now that the master terrorist has departed the scene? Will mindless violence and endless stalemate finally be buried along with Arafat? \"Certainly, the opportunity is there - provided the Palestinians are ready to resume good-faith negotiations unburdened by the spectre of terrorism and bloodshed ... But it won't be easy. For one thing, the Palestinian Authority leadership has been divided up in such a way as to render a power struggle inevitable ... Yet, if the Palestinian people finally understand that political stalemate means further suffering on their part, if they back leaders who embrace that concept and are willing to act on it - then prospects for a genuine and swift progress toward a real peace will soar. \"It would be a mistake for foreign nations - the US included - to impose themselves heavy-handedly on the process. Ultimately, this ... must be resolved by the parties themselves.\" New York Times Editorial, November 12 \"For the past four years, the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, and Mr Bush have used the very existence of Arafat to justify their abandonment of the peace process ... Now Arafat is gone, and so are the excuses ... \"There are bound to be attacks by Palestinian extremists, which will allow Mr Sharon to dig in his heels and say he will negotiate only if the new leaders crack down on radicals. Arafat's successors will be under extraordinary pressure to follow Arafat's path by talking to the west about peace while allowing the terrorists to dictate actions at home. But Israel can help shore up the credibility of moderate reformers by beginning a total freeze on settlements and beginning to address their calls to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza.\" Newton N Minow and Martha Minow Chicago Tribune, November 12 \"This is the moment that America could play a crucial role in breaking the Middle East stalemate. Doing so with boldness, imagination and courage could truly usher in a new era and forge a stronger US ... Mr Bush should send ... Bill Clinton to the Middle East as his representative to renew the discussions ended four years ago. This will strike Republican and Democratic partisans alike as inconceivable ... But there are landmark American precedents that built a valuable tradition of bipartisan foreign policy, a tradition lacking in recent years ... \"What's in it for Mr Bush? ... If he helps achieve peace in the Middle East, he will remove the issue from partisan politics and secure his place in history at the same time ... And most important of all, if the US successfully leads the way to peace in the Middle East, we will deliver a mortal blow to terrorists acting in the name of Islamic fundamentalism.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
