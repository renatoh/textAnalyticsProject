The City regulator is believed to have informed the company about the initiation of an in-depth investigation into the prospectus it published to lure potential investors in March, when it was sold off by its American owner Spherion. While the regulator's suspi cions were aroused in June when the company issued an unexpected profits warning, the initial investigation has been put on to a more official footing in recent days, it is understood. The FSA, which recently took over the responsibility for policing the rules with which stock market companies must comply, is understood to have begun a wide-ranging investigation into the information provided to investors, to establish whether the detail in the financial accounts was misleading. Yesterday, growing concern about the prospects for the company, which specialises in recruiting middle managers, sent its shares to a new low of 128p - well below the 175p at which they were sold to investors in March. The flotation price of 175p was already a knock-down on the original estimate by the advisers Credit Suisse First Boston, which had set a target of 190p to 250p. But, to ensure the flotation was successful in difficult market conditions, the price was reduced. The FSA's inquiries team is thought to be looking for evidence that the company failed to warn investors about an impending downturn in its fortunes at the time of the flotation. The City interpreted the detail provided in the prospectus as providing reassurance that it could withstand any continued slowdown in the global economy. In May, comments by the company were said to provide similar reassurance but at the end of June the City was shocked by the profits warning. It said that its interim profits would not show any growth on the 42.5m pounds it made last year. The prospectus for its March flotation referred to \"more challenging conditions in certain markets and the nature of the current macro-economic environment introduces a measure of uncertainty\". \"However, the broad diversity and strength of the group's businesses in terms of sectors, disciplines and geography give management confidence, at this early stage, in the outlook for the full year,\" it continued. By June, the company was warning that a slowdown in demand in financial services, IT and telecoms and a weakness in the US and Australian economies was having an impact across all its business sectors and geographic markets. At the time of the warning, Terry Benson, the chief executive who, along with the rest of the management, owns a 6% stake that cannot be sold for three years, responded to criticism that the company was slow to communicate with investors by explaining that the recruitment industry could not predict its business more than two months in advance. Last night, the regulator declined to comment as did the company and Credit Suisse First Boston."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
