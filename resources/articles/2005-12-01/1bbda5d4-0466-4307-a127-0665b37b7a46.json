Born: July 21, 1972. Occupation :Won a Perrier best newcomer award, as one third of The Consultants, in 2002, and was nominated for this year's Perrier comedy award for his act, Jeremy Lion, drunken children's entertainer. College: Stratford-Upon-Avon College. Course: Year-out drama. Attended: 1990-1991. Deborah Moody, course director, recalls: \"I remember his mother saying to me, 'When you meet Justin you might not think he looks like the archetypal actor.' He was 1.9 metres (6ft 4in), with wide shoulders. He goes through a doorway and practically takes the frame with him. He befriended a guy called Billy who was lean and wily, and they made a great pair. He was a very good ensemble member. He sings like an angel, with a sweet, almost counter-tenor voice, and then he can sing right down low. When when you hear him singing up high, you think, 'Wow!' For such a huge presence, he's a very modest and gentle person. He's a great guy, very generous in spirit.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
