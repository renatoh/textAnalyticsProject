The Winners each acknowledge that it is not always possible for GNL to identify them as the author of the Reports and photographs (although GNL will try to do so wherever possible). The Winners irrevocably and unconditionally waive their moral rights to be identified as the author of the Reports and photographs and agree that GNL may adapt, add to, amend and or use the submissions as it deems appropriate. 29. Winners will assume sole responsibility for their own actions and their own safety throughout their journeys as well as any arrangements and accommodation.
