An ex-politician", "bodyText": "Gordon Brown's description of himself this week as an ex-politician raised sceptical eyebrows. And properly so, given that the former prime minister is still a member of parliament with political responsibilities both to his constituents and to his party. But this all triggers a wider question. Can there really ever be such a thing as an ex-politician? Most former cabinet ministers and many senior MPs translate seamlessly to the House of Lords, where they continue to be legislators. It is hard to imagine Jack Straw or Sir Menzies Campbell, both of whom have announced their retirements in 2015, disappearing from public debates. Even many of those who leave parliament altogether, of whom John Major and Tony Blair are the most senior examples, retain the ability and the will to enter political debates from time to time. Tony Benn, now 88, certainly still plays a role, as the release of his latest volume of diaries underlined this week. Even some of those who have established themselves in other careers \u2013 broadcasters David Mellor and Michael Portillo, writer Jonathan Aitken, or banker Sir John Nott \u2013 have sometimes been tempted back into a corner of the political arena. Like Cincinnatus in ancient Rome, even today's most fastidious ex-politicians may sincerely turn their backs on the political world only to be tempted back to it in one way or another. With very rare exceptions, once a politician always a politician. From everything we know about him, that's surely the case with Mr Brown above all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
