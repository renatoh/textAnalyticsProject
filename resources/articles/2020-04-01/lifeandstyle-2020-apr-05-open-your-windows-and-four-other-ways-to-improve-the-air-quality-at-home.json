Open your windows,\u201d says Dr Appelles Econs, an allergy specialist at the Burghwood Clinic. Keeping your windows shut all day will allow chemicals and allergens to build up inside. Even if you live in a polluted city, you are going to have to open the windows from time to time. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be stuck in a house with no ventilation all day,\u201d says Dr Paul Young of Lancaster University. \u201cIf you live near a super-busy road, you may not want to have the window open all the time, but you are going to need to ventilate.\u201d Opening your windows at night, when the traffic has lessened, can be a good option. Plants will help, but not much Research by Nasa in the 1980s found that plants do remove toxic pollutants from the air. However, these studies were carried out in closed environments, similar to conditions in space. Back on Earth, plants will improve air quality, but not as much as you may think. \u201cUnless you have a rainforest in your home, the effect can be minimal,\u201d explains Prof Pawel Wargocki of the Technical University of Denmark. \u201cYou need to have many plants to see a meaningful effect on air quality because buildings are not fully airtight environments \u2013 there is always air coming in from outside.\u201d Minimise pollutants in your home \u201cWhen cooking, make sure you have your ventilator fan on,\u201d says Young. \u201cAnd don\u2019t smoke inside \u2013 smoke can hang around for a long time inside.\u201d Consider the products you are using to clean your home. \u201cEven if their containers are firmly closed, cleaning chemicals produce volatile organic components,\u201d says Econs. If possible, keep cleaning products outside the house, in a garden shed or garage. Econs is not a fan of air fresheners or room sprays, for the same reason. Consider the materials you are using Wooden flooring, rather than carpets, may improve air quality. \u201cMany fresh carpets are cured with formaldehyde,\u201d says Econs. \u201cWooden floors are more healthy by comparison.\u201d Dust mites can live in soft furnishings, such as cushions and mattresses. The faecal pellets they produce can trigger allergy-like symptoms. \u201cGet a barrier mattress cover,\u201d advises Econs, \u201cwhich can help prevent dust mites from living in your mattress.\u201d Beware excess moisture \u201cThe greatest factor affecting air quality in British households is indoor humidity,\u201d says Econs. Minimise humidity by ventilating \u2013 and deal urgently with any mould on the walls. \u201cAfter showering, remove local moisture,\u201d says Wargocki, by wiping down surfaces and turning on the bathroom extractor fan. And when it comes to washing clothes, try to dry them outside if possible, or at least in a well-ventilated space."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
