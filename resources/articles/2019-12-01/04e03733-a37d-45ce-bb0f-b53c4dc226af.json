Pardons are traditional at the end of a governor\u2019s term \u2013 and most of the Republican\u2019s more than 400 pardons were for drug offenses. But a number of the pardons were for particularly violent crimes, like a woman who gave birth in a flea market porta-potty and dumped her newborn into the toilet\u2019s septic tank; a man who hired a hitman to murder his business partner in front of his family; a man convicted of beheading a woman and stuffing her body in a 55-gallon drum; a man convicted last year of raping a nine-year-old child; and a man convicted in a home invasion homicide whose brother hosted a fundraiser for the governor last year. In that last case, Patrick Baker was pardoned just two years into his 19-year sentence for an incident in which he and several others impersonated law enforcement officers to gain entry to a home before shooting and killing a man inside. Two others imprisoned for the crime were not pardoned, despite prosecutors saying that Baker was the one who pulled the trigger. In announcing the pardon, Bevin questioned the evidence presented in the case and the jury\u2019s decision to convict Baker. \u201cThe evidence supporting his conviction is sketchy at best,\u201d wrote Bevin in the pardon. \u201cI am not convinced that justice has been served on the death of Donald Mills, nor am I convinced that the evidence has proven the involvement of Patrick Baker as murderer.\u201d Bevin\u2019s conclusion is starkly at odds with the judge who sentenced Baker, David Williams, who according to the Louisville Courier-Journal said: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a more compelling or complete case \u2026 the evidence was just overwhelming.\u201d Baker\u2019s brother Eric hosted Bevin at a fundraiser for the then governor at his home last year, raising $21,500, according to the paper, which has sparked accusations that the pardon was a favor, not the righting of a wrongful conviction. In a letter to the Republican attorney general-elect, Daniel Cameron, on Friday, the Democratic senate minority leader, Morgan McGarvey, and the state representative Chris Harris asked for a special prosecutor or bipartisan special prosecuting team to investigate Bevin\u2019s pardons, particularly the Baker pardon. The power to pardon \u201cwas granted to serve justice and hold public officeholders accountable, not to grant political favors to powerful friends and campaign donors\u201d, they wrote. \u201cThe appearance of corruption in this instance is overwhelming and cannot be overlooked or brushed aside.\u201d In the case of Micah Schoettle, who was found guilty last year of raping a nine-year-old girl, Bevin also lashed out against the evidence and the jury\u2019s decision. \u201cMicah Schoettle was tried and convicted of a heinous crime based only on testimony that was not supported by any physical evidence,\u201d wrote Bevin in his pardon. \u201cThis case was investigated and prosecuted in a manner that was sloppy at best. I do not believe that the charges against Mr Schoettle are true.\u201d Rob Sanders, the commonwealth\u2019s attorney who prosecuted the case, told the Courier-Journal that Bevin\u2019s pardon was an \u201cirresponsible manipulation of the justice system\u201d. \u201cI guess Matt Bevin thinks he\u2019s smarter than 12 citizens that heard the actual evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got news for him: child molesting rarely happens in front of witnesses or leaves physical evidence. If we don\u2019t pursue those cases, 99% of child rapists would never be prosecuted.\u201d On Friday evening, Bevin responded to the controversy with a Twitter thread, defending the pardons by saying that he had spent \u201chundreds of hours\u201d reviewing applications for pardons and saying that he would welcome anybody he pardoned as a \u201cco-worker, neighbor, or to sit beside me or any member of my family in a church pew or at a public event\u201d. He also appeared to lash out at those who accused him of corruption in pardoning Baker, whose brother hosted a fundraiser for him. \u201cThe myriad of statements and suggestions that financial or political considerations played a part in the decision making process, are both highly offensive and entirely false,\u201d he said. \u201cTo repeat such uncorroborated rumors and lies is reprehensible.\u201d But Bevin was finding few defenders, even within his own party. On Friday, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said Bevin\u2019s pardons were \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d. \u201cI expect he had the power to do it, but looking at the examples of people who were incarcerated as a result of heinous crimes \u2013 no, I don\u2019t approve of it,\u201d the Republican senator told reporters in Kentucky\u2019s capital of Frankfort. Bevin did not leave office quietly following his narrow loss to the Democrat Andy Beshear in last month\u2019s election. Known as a pugnacious governor, Bevin, who campaigned with Donald Trump in the days leading up to the vote, disputed the election results and, without evidence, charged that widespread voter fraud occurred, a move that stoked rightwing conspiracy theories about the election. Beshear was sworn into office just after midnight on Tuesday, but his first days in office have been overshadowed by his predecessor\u2019s pardons. On Thursday, Bevin told the Washington Post he was \u201ca big believer in second chances\u201d after the paper asked about the pardons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
