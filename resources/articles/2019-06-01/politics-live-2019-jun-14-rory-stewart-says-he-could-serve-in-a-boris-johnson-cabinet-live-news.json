Here\u2019s a summary: Boris Johnson has declined an invitation to participate in Sunday\u2019s Channel 4 leadership debate against his five remaining rivals to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister, saying he feared it would be \u201ccacophonous\u201d. However, under growing pressure to submit to greater public scrutiny, the frontrunner has said he will take part in a similar event, hosted by the BBC, next Tuesday \u2013 after MPs have held a second round of voting, and at least one more candidate has been knocked out. In his first interview of the campaign Johnson insisted he had only taken cocaine once as a teenager. Johnson described the incident as \u201ca single inconclusive event that took place when I was a teenager and which I have extensively described\u201d. Asked if he had used the drug since then, he said: \u201cNo.\u201d Johnson reiterated his commitment to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October. He insisted alternative arrangements to the Irish backstop could be renegotiated and in the meantime the UK should prepare for a no-deal exit. Johnson defended his record as foreign secretary and said criticism of his handling of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s case deflected blame from the Iranians who are holding her. He said: \u201cIf you point the finger of blame at me or anybody who has tried to get Nazanin out, then I think you are unintentionally exculpating the people who are really responsible, and that is the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.\u201d The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has pulled out of the race to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister, but declined to throw his weight behind another candidate. He appeared to blame Brexit for his decision to bow out. \u201cI ran as the candidate of the future, but the party is understandably looking for a candidate for the unique circumstances we face right now,\u201d Hancock said. Jeremy Hunt has accused his leadership rival Boris Johnson of hiding from the media. \u201cWhat would Churchill say if someone who wants to be prime minister of the United Kingdom is hiding away from the media?\u201d he said. The chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum has compared Boris Johnson to Adolf Hitler and said he would quit the party if the former foreign secretary is elected as leader. Mohammed Amin said: \u201cI am not prepared to be a member of a party that chooses him as its leader. I would resign after 36 years.\u201d Rory Stewart, who came seventh in the first round, has said he could now serve in a Boris Johnson government after previously ruling that out. The international development secretary also refused to say whether he would trust Johnson with the UK\u2019s nuclear codes. The former Labour MP Chuka Umunna has said there is no room for two centre-ground parties in British politics after joining the Liberal Democrats 10 days after abandoning Change UK. Explaining his decision to join his third party in five months, the Streatham MP admitted he \u201cmassively underestimated just how difficult\u201d it was to set up a new party. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has revealed that just two of the remaining contenders for the Conservative party leadership have so far accepted his challenge and pledged to work to keep down Britain\u2019s national debt. Hammond, who sought assurances after becoming alarmed by the spending promises being made by Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab, disclosed that he had received private commitments from two campaigns. \u201cI believe that fiscal responsibility is one of the unique selling points of my party,\u201d Hammond said as he arrived at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Luxembourg. \u201cWe have over a long period built the hard-won reputation for fiscal responsibility and managing the economy and the public finances and I want to ensure that the candidates commit to carrying on with the work that we\u2019ve been doing over the last nine years. \u201cA couple of the candidates have signalled privately that they will be signing up to the pledge but I\u2019m waiting to see what we get back.\u201d Here\u2019s a transcript of Johnson\u2019s other comments by subject: Hiding from the media I\u2019ve been subjecting myself to scrutiny on the part of my colleagues in Parliament and lots of hustings have taken place. I\u2019ve done newspaper interviews and here I am. I always been keen on TV debates and slightly bewildered by the the conversation that\u2019s been going on, because I think it is important that we have a sensible grown up debate. And my own observation is that I think in the past, when you\u2019ve had loads of candidates, it can be slightly cacophonous. And I think the public have had quite a lot of blue on blue action, frankly, over the last three years, we don\u2019t necessarily need a lot more of that. I think the best solution would be to have a debate on what we all have to offer the country, our programme to take Britain forward. And the best time to do that, I think would be after the second ballot on Tuesday. And the best forum is the proposed BBC debate. Sunday\u2019s Channel 4 debate I must have received dozens and dozens of invitations to do hustings here, there and everywhere, and debates of all kinds. But as I say, I think there can be a risk of a slight cacophony when you have lots and lots of candidates, but also the impression of yet more blue on blue action. When I think what the public wants to hear is a serious debate. I\u2019m very keen on TV debates and did many, many if people remember, in the run up to London mayoral elections. I think, by the end, a certain sort of narcolepsy had descended on the TV audience. So I\u2019m more than happy to do the the BBC TV debate on Tuesday. Worries about saying the wrong things People will always try to find a moment when they can say that they\u2019ve tripped me up, or forced me into some gaffe or indiscretion or error of some kind. But I will continue to be the kind of politician I\u2019ve been for a very long time. And that is somebody who believes passionately, in his ideas. Somebody I want to take this country forward, I think we have some fantastic projects now going on to unite the UK with infrastructure, with education, with technology. In a nutshell, what I want to do in the UK is do what we did in London to try to unite our society and bring it together. If sometimes I say things that cause a fluttering in the dovecots or plaster to come off the ceiling, if it gets people\u2019s attention if it interests them in politics, then I think that is no bad thing. Defeating opponents I think that we have a good formula to take the country forward a winning formula. It is modern, progressive conservatism, and it is the way to defeat Jeremy Corbyn and also to take the wind out of the sails, both of the Liberals and of the new Brexit party. Both those parties are of course, feasting mightily on the the failure of the political class in this country at the moment to sort out Brexit. No-deal I don\u2019t aim for no deal. I don\u2019t want no deal as the outcome of the talks. Of course not. I don\u2019t want us to leave with a WTO solution. But I certainly don\u2019t think that some of the promises of doom and disaster are true. And I think we will find plenty of people who will give you a very different verdict about about what no deal would mean. We can get to a situation in which we are able to leave smoothly with an orderly, managed Brexit. And that\u2019s what we should be aiming for. But the only way to make sure that we convince our partners that were determined to get that outcome is to prepare for no deal. Leaving the EU by 31 October I think it is perfectly realistic. And there is a clear way that the now effectively defunct withdrawal agreement can be disaggregated. The good bits of it can be taken out. I think what we should do is take the provisions on citizenship, take the offer that we make to the 3.2 million EU citizens in our country and just do it ... We got to be out by October the 31st. And I think it would be absolutely bizarre for to signal at this stage that the UK government was willing, once again, to run up the white flag and delay yet again. My commitment is to honour the will of the people and take this country out on October 31st. And the way to do it, as I say is to desegregate the current withdrawal agreement and move on. The Irish Backstop The fundamental flaw in the current withdrawal agreement, which everybody understands, is the Irish backstop arrangements. That\u2019s a prison, that\u2019s Hobson\u2019s choice. The solution is obvious. It is something that actually united MPs on on all sides of the house when they voted for the Brady amendments. Our friends and partners over the channel will say this is impossible. We can\u2019t do this. It\u2019s the unicorns and so on. And I perfectly understand that. But I think actually there is a solution to be arrived at in that area. Preparation for no deal In the meantime, it\u2019s absolutely crucial to prepare for no deal. And I don\u2019t share the deep pessimism of some people about the consequences of no deal. That\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t think there will be some difficulties that need to be addressed. Unless we show fortitude and determination I don\u2019t think that we will carry conviction in Brussels, about about the deal we want to do. Avoiding a hard border Those problems are easily capable of a solution, as I think the Commission has said in the past, with maximum facilitation techniques. You already have goods conforming to different standards. France, for instance, has different laws on flame retardant furniture, and we have no checks at the the borders to intercept goods from France. The obvious way to do it is to make sure that you have checks on anybody who breaks the law, but you do it away from the border. And that is common ground. Anybody who breaks the law, is clearly going to be subject to checks and investigation. There is already smuggling across that border and smugglers are intercepted in the normal in the normal way. There are ways of doing this, that do not require a hard border. Switching Irish border questions to implementation phase The solutions to the facilitation that need to be provided to enable us to do a proper free trade deal with our friends and partners, those should not be preordained by the backstop. But they should be remitted into the implementation period for discussion after we have left it in the context of negotiation of the free trade deal. That is the obvious solution. It\u2019s something that is agreed on all sides of the house. I accept that at the moment, the EU will say we can\u2019t accept that. They\u2019re bound to say that at present. I think that they will find a way forward. It would not be sensible for the UK to depart in that kind of disorderly way. But if we have to get out on no deal terms then it is our absolute responsibility to prepare for it. And it\u2019s by preparing for it that we prevent that outcome. Persuading the EU to renegotiate I think what they will see is that politics has changed in the in the UK. And and in Europe. They have now 29 Brexit MEPs. The parties in this country are facing an existential threat. Both the Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats are leading the polls, as a result of the failure of the two main parties to deliver on the will of the people. That is what needs to happen. It needs to happen by October, the 31st. And we need to get on and do it and all those who say that we should delay that we should kick the can down the road. I think they risk doing terminal damage to trust in politics. One Nation Conservative Once we move on, we will be able to do many, many things. Once we get Brexit off the front pages, there will be a massive opportunity for the Conservative Party once again, to occupy the centre ground of politics and to speak for huge numbers of people in the country who feel they were left behind. And now is the time to do some absolutely fantastic things. On foreign office gaffes When I was foreign secretary we managed to organise the single biggest diplomatic coup this country has pulled off that I can remember, when I like about 30 countries around the world expelled 153 Russian spies collectively in response to the poisonings in Salisbury. Any more blue on blue action in this in this contest is is not what I want to get into. But I was very proud as foreign secretary to have expanded our network very considerably to have championed female education around the world, and done quite a lot actually to to stop the illegal wildlife trade around the world to say nothing of hosting a great Commonwealth summit and many, many other things. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe One\u2019s sympathy is with Nazanin, her family clearly and with the families of the other consular cases. If you point the finger of blame at me or anybody who has tried to get Nazain out, then I think you are unintentionally exculpating the people who are really responsible, and that is the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Quds force and Qassem Suleimani, who are illegally and inhumanely detaining those individuals. Failures over detail Look at the record of what we delivered in London, in eight years. We out built Labour in housing, we had record investment in transport, we tube delays by 30%, we cut crime by about 20%. And we cut the murder rate by 50%. And we worked flat out to achieve that. And it was because I had a great team that I was able to do that. And we will have a great team, if I\u2019m lucky enough to be elected, that will deliver the same kind of progress and the same sort of improvements for the people of this entire country. And that is my ambition. And that is why I\u2019m standing in this race. PA\u2019s first take on the interview focuses on the cocaine question: Boris Johnson has denied using cocaine since a \u201csingle inconclusive event\u201d more than 30 years ago. The Conservative Party leadership favourite, who has repeatedly appeared to dodge questions over his previous drug use throughout his campaign to succeed Theresa May as Prime Minister, said he had only used the Class A substance once. During an interview with BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One, Johnson described the incident as \u201ca single inconclusive event that took place when I was a teenager and which I have extensively described\u201d. Asked if he had used the drug since then, he said: \u201cNo.\u201d Probing questions about previous misdemeanours and the use of drugs have become an evergreen feature of the Conservative Party leadership race. Candidates such as Michael Gove and Rory Stewart made revelatory comments about their dabblings with cocaine and opium, respectively. Johnson confessed to having used cocaine during an interview with British GQ magazine in 2007, in which he said it \u201cachieved no pharmacological, psychotropical or any other effect on me whatsoever\u201d. But he was reluctant to elaborate when questioned about it during his campaign launch on Wednesday. He said: \u201cI think the canonical account of this event when I was 19 has appeared many, many times. \u201cI think what most people in this country want us to really focus on in this campaign, if I may say so, is what we can do for them and what our plans are for this great country of ours.\u201d Here\u2019s some initial reaction to Johnson\u2019s interview: Asked about his gaffe-prone stint as foreign secretary, Johnson cited his success in persuading the UK\u2019s allies to expel Russia diplomats in the wake of the Salisbury poisonings. He refused to respond to Alan Duncan\u2019s dig that he was Johnson\u2019s \u201cpooper scooper\u201d in the foreign office. Johnson said he did not want to indulge in more blue on blue action. On criticism of his handling of the imprisonment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran, he says focusing on his comments deflect blame from the Iranians. Johnson again dodged questions about taking cocaine, but claimed he had only taken it once as a teenager. There are ways of doing this without a hard border, Johnson insists in relation to the backstop. These issues should be discussed after the UK leaves the EU on 31 October. He insists again that he would take the UK out by that deadline. He said: \u201cWe have got to be out by October 31st. It would be absolutely bizarre to signal at this stage that UK government would run up the white flag and delay.\u201d If debates interest the public that\u2019s a good thing, Johnson says, even if \u201cplaster flies off the ceiling\u201d. Asked about a no-deal, he says \u201cI don\u2019t want us to leave with a WTO solution\u201d. But predictions of doom and disaster about no-deal are wrong, he claims. He says he is aiming for a managed, orderly and smooth Brexit and calls for preparations for a no-deal. The fundamental flaw in the current withdrawal agreement is the backstop on the Irish border, he says. The solution is obvious he says, and cites the Brady amendment on alternative arrangements to a hard border with Ireland. In the meantime we need to prepare for a no-deal. \u201cI don\u2019t share the deep pessimism about no-deal,\u201d Johnson says but he concedes it would be difficult. In his BBC Radio interview, Johnson denies he has been ducking the media. He likes TV debates he says, but claims the public is tired of \u201cblue on blue action\u201d. The best time to debate would be after the second ballot of Tory MPs. He says he is \u201cmore than happy\u201d to do the BBC debate on Tuesday, and refuses to say whether he will take part in Sunday\u2019s debate on Channel 4. We\u2019re switching attention back to the Tory leadership race, after Boris Johnson breaks his interview silence. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One that he will miss a leadership debate hosted by Channel 4 on Sunday because there would be too many people involved. Instead, he said he would be prepared to take part in the BBC debate on Tuesday evening once the field has narrowed after the second leadership contest ballot earlier in the day. According to the BBC, Johnson told the programme: \u201cI think it is important that we have a sensible grown-up debate. My own observation is that in the past when you\u2019ve had loads of candidates, it can be slightly cacophonous and I think the public have had quite a lot of blue on blue action frankly over the last three years. \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily need a lot more of that and so what I think the best solution would be, would be to have a debate on what we all have to offer the country and the best time to do that I think would be after the second ballot on Tuesday and the best forum is the proposed BBC debate. I think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Umunna says he doesn\u2019t want to be leader of the LibDems and refuses to endorse either Swinson or Davey for the post. On drugs, Umunna admits to smoking dope, but never taking cocaine. Perhaps Boris Johnson will answer that question, Umunna says. Umunna says Labour\u2019s position on Brexit hasn\u2019t changed in the last two years, Umunna says. Corbyn is a Brexiteer, he says. Labour has only changed \u201ctonally\u201d on Brexit since the Independent Group MPs left. Asked about splits in Change UK, Umunna says he always thought it would need to work with other parties. Others in Change UK disagreed. I was fundamentally wrong about the need for a new party, he says. What about a byelection? Ian Lavery (the chairman of the Labour party) likes to talk about people\u2019s vote for a byelection for defecting MPs, but rules out a people\u2019s vote on Brexit, Umunna says. Q: Why not have a byelection in Streatham? And is the LibDem party your final resting place? Yes, Umunna says to the last question. I got something wrong, something has changed, I changed my mind. I\u2019m a Streatham boy and committed to my constituency, Umunna says, but he dodges the byelection question. Moving to the Q&amp;As. Cable is asked how many other MPs will defect to the LibDems. He says there is a sizeable chunk of disgruntled Tory MPs over Brexit. He said there similar disquiet in Labour citing this week meeting of the PLP. The question for Labour is how they can support Brexit and end austerity. Many in the party privately accept this, Umunna says. Labour is not being true to its progressive values. \u201cThere is a home for you: it is the Liberal Democrats\u201d, he says in a plea to disgruntled members of his former party. Umunna says he found it hard to comes to terms with the austerity measures of the coalition government. He says he disagreed with the speed of the cuts. Four years on, things have changed, Umunna insists, citing its anti-austerity manifesto. Things like the bedroom tax and the U-turn on university tuition fees should never have happened. But you can\u2019t end austerity and sponsor Brexit, Umunna claims. Umunna repeats that he was wrong about the need for another centre ground party. He said it was important to learn lessons in politics. He conceded he \u201cmassively underestimated\u201d the difficulty in forming a new party. And credits Vince Cable with warning him him how tricky it would be without an infrastructure. Umunna says he has been warmly welcomed since join the LibDems and jokes about his lack of political loyalty. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a particularly tribal person. You can probably tell that from the number or parties I\u2019ve been part of this year,\u201d he says. He also describes himself as an internationalist which is why he is so opposed to Brexit. The Chuka Umunna press conference has begun. It\u2019s Siobhan Benita, the Lib Dems\u2019 candidate for London mayor, up first. She jokingly bestows the title of \u201cHead of Branding\u201d for her mayoral campaign on Umunna before saying more seriously: \u201cWe appreciate it can\u2019t have been easy for you.\u201d Boris Johnson has told the BBC that he will take part in the BBC leadership debate. Former Labour peer Lord Sugar, the businessman and Apprentice host, is backing Boris Johnson as the best candidate to beat Jeremy Corbyn. Sugar resigned from the Labour party in May 2015 after an 18-year affiliation, attacking what he called \u201canti-enterprise concepts\u201d and \u201ca policy shift moving back towards what old Labour stood for\u201d. Sky\u2019s Sam Coates has been told that Hancock will not be backing Javid and speculates that his supporters will switch to either Hunt, Javid or Stewart. David Jeffery, a lecturer in politics at Liverpool University, reckons Hancock\u2019s 20 supporters in the first round are most likely to switch to Jeremy Hunt, followed by Sajid Javid, based on their voting records and support for candidates in the 2016 leadership race. . Sajid Javid has become the first of the remaining six candidates to fish for Hancock\u2019s votes. He won\u2019t be the last. Former cabinet minister Damian Green, who backed Hancock, has urged the other candidates to leave him alone until next week. Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened so far today: The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has pulled out of the race to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister, but declined to throw his weight behind another candidate. He appeared to blame Brexit for his decision to bow out. \u201cI ran as the candidate of the future, but the party is understandably looking for a candidate for the unique circumstances we face right now,\u201d Hancock said. Jeremy Hunt has accused his leadership rival Boris Johnson of hiding from the media. \u201cWhat would Churchill say if someone who wants to be prime minister of the United Kingdom is hiding away from the media?\u201d he said. The chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum has compared Boris Johnson to Adolf Hitler and said he would quit the party if the former foreign secretary is elected as leader. Mohammed Amin said: \u201cI am not prepared to be a member of a party that chooses him as its leader. I would resign after 36 years.\u201d Rory Stewart, who came seventh in the first round, has said he could now serve in a Boris Johnson government after previously ruling that out. The international development secretary also refused to say whether he would trust Johnson with the UK\u2019s nuclear codes. The former Labour MP Chuka Umunna has said there is no room for two centre-ground parties in British politics after joining the Liberal Democrats 10 days after abandoning Change UK. Explaining his decision to join his third party in five months, the Streatham MP admitted he \u201cmassively underestimated just how difficult\u201d it was to set up a new party. Asked by Sky News whether Rory Stewart, Sajid Javid, and Dominic Raab should also pull out, Hancock said; They\u2019ll make their decisions, I\u2019m not going to put pressure on them, I\u2019m going to think about what is the best way for me to advance the values that I care about, that I\u2019ve articulated and made the case for in this campaign. And as I say, I feel like I\u2019ve been winning arguments during the campaign. With a dig at Boris Johnson he pointed out that he had campaigned for an open contest including TV debate. On Johnson\u2019s threat to prorogue parliament to get Brexit through, Hancock said: I think that proroguing parliament would be wrong. It really against all the the democratic ideals that we stand for as a country, and also to be totally impractical, and it would never work. I want us to deliver Brexit and then move forward. And it\u2019s the moving forward that I\u2019ve been really focused on. Hancock also suggested he would be best candidate in the next Tory leadership race. If you look at the results of the first round the party is it\u2019s pretty clear that they want somebody who\u2019s involved in the debates of the here and now. I\u2019m going to focus on the future. And I\u2019m going to concentrate on making sure this party is always looking with optimism, to the future to deliver for people, because that\u2019s what we need to do. That\u2019s the whole point of being in politics is to make life better for people in this country. And that\u2019s the values I\u2019m going to concentrate on. In a video announcing he was bowing out of the race, Hancock appeared to blame Brexit for his withdrawal: I put myself forward as the candidate for the future, but it is increasingly clear that the party, understandably, is looking for a candidate for the unique circumstances that exist now. Announcing his decision Hancock said: \u201cI ran as the candidate of the future, but the party is understandably looking for a candidate for the unique circumstances we face right now. I will talk to all the other candidates about how these values can be best taken forward.\u201d Health secretary Matt Hancock has announced he is pulling out of the race to become Tory leader. He came sixth with 20 votes in the first round. Hancock hasn\u2019t said who he be backing in the next round. Rory Stewart has ducked his own question about whether Boris Johnson could be trusted with the UK\u2019s nuclear codes. The international development secretary made doubts about Johnson\u2019s trustworthiness a key part of his leadership launch on Tuesday. Speaking to an audience of 600 members of the public, he \u201cDo you really feel that this is the person that you want engaging in the detail of the future of your health and education system? Is this the person you want writing the instruction to the nuclear submarines? Is this the man that you want embodying your nation and guiding you through the most difficult choice we\u2019ve faced for 50 years?\u201d But asked by LBC Eddie Mair today whether Stewart himself would trust Johnson with the codes, he refused to answer. The usually fluent Stewart appeared stumped by his own question and repeatedly refused to answer it. He said: \u201cI\u2019m avoiding your question, I\u2019m going to duck your question.\u201d When pressed he said it was for Tory members to decide whether they trusted Johnson with the nuclear codes. Both Jeremy Hunt, and his campaign, have retweeted his what-would-Churchill-say attack line against Boris Johnson. But backing for Johnson\u2019s decision to duck the debates comes from Christopher Meyer, whose previous roles include chair of the Press Complaints Commission, UK ambassador to the US, and John Major\u2019s press secretary. One of my former bosses, Ian Katz, now director of programmes at Channel 4, is joining in the goading of Boris Johnson to take part in the TV debate on Sunday. Duck or debate? Katz asks the former foreign secretary. The broadcaster, Alastair Stewart, who has chaired previous leadership debates says Johnson\u2019s avoidance of interviews is \u201coutrageous\u201d. The Spectator\u2019s deputy editor, Freddy Gray blames Lynton Crosby who is running Johnson\u2019s campaign: He is a veritable TV debatephobe. He has run the last two Tory general elections, and he ordered David Cameron and Theresa May to shy away from the TV debates. In Crosby\u2019s view, debate-ducking is the sensible course. He sees no upside. For frontrunners, especially, if the debate goes well, there is no real uptick in support. The only way a TV debate can influence an election is if a candidate is a massive gaffe, a viral FAIL that destroys his or her credibility. So best shunned. That makes perfect sense in terms of winning \u2014 perhaps doubly so in Boris\u2019s case, with so much of the anti-Brexit media bubble desperate for him to slip up. It\u2019s why Boris\u2019s team are apparently so wedded to this \u2018submarine\u2019 strategy. But it is cowardly. It is wet, to use a word Tories are familiar with. Nobody wants to be led by a coward. The short-term benefits of removing the banana-skin should be set against the longer term negatives of making you candidate look like a slippery fish. Even when you win, you look sly. Moreover, as a tactic, debate ducking undervalues Boris\u2019s talents. LibDem leadership hopeful Jo Swinson is buoyed by the defection of Chuka Umunna to her party. Labour continues to trawl up Umunna\u2019s past criticism of the LibDems. Umunna admitted he was hesitant about joining the Lib Dems because of their role in the austerity programme under the coalition government. He told Today: \u201cThe thing that has given me pause for thought definitely has been the time that the Liberal Democrats served in coalition and the austerity. But things have changed since then, the Liberal Democrats have voted against every single Conservative budget since 2015.\u201d There is mounting speculation that the health secretary, Matt Hancock, is poised to withdraw from the race, but if he does it unclear who he would endorse. Candidates have until 1pm today to say if they want to enter the next round of voting on Tuesday, when they need to get 33 votes to proceed to the next round.That looks a tough ask for Hancock who came sixth with 20 votes, one more than Stewart. The health secretary met fifth-place rival Sajid Javid, who got 23 votes, for talks last night, according to Newsnight\u2019s Nick Watt. But it unclear what the outcome of those talks was, as Sky Sophy Ridge notes: Here\u2019s a reminder of the results of the first round of voting: Rory Stewart is also trying to bounce Johnson into taking part in the TV debates. Earlier he told the Today programme: The real judgment the members of parliament have to make is who do they want going up against Boris in the final two, and there\u2019s only one way they can judge that, which is by seeing Boris on the stage against the other candidates. It feels as though he is feels that he\u2019s doing well, that he\u2019s winning, and that he doesn\u2019t want to take any risk, which could upset the campaign. But I think it\u2019s a great pity. He\u2019s a great public performer, the public need to see him. Like Hunt, Stewart warned against t a repeat of the 2016 leadership election when Theresa May was chosen without a vote. I think it\u2019s also really important for the legitimacy of the choice of the prime minister, that this doesn\u2019t take place in a smoke filled room, but that the public is able to see the candidates out in public. And in fact, I think maybe it\u2019s a lesson from the last leadership race that we need to test the candidates on TV front of the public with rigorous questioning before they become Prime Minister. Asked what he would ask Johnson, Stewart said: There are a number of questions I\u2019ve asked which I haven\u2019t had an answer to. One of them is about the question of whether or not he\u2019ll say that he would never suspend parliament. I\u2019d also like some clarity from him and indeed, from other candidates, on whether they will meet the Chancellor\u2019s fiscal rules on debt and borrowing. But the most important question of all, for Boris and indeed for some of the other candidates is, what is this no deal Brexit and how are they going to do it? He keeps saying he will deliver Brexit by the 31st of October, but how we need to get into the details of how it\u2019s going to happen? How is he going to renegotiate. How is he going to get it through Parliament? Because this can\u2019t just be a blind act of faith. One way of seeing that is going to be these TV debates. I think it\u2019s going to be critical because Boris is one of the greatest communicators in modern British political life. So the question is going to be which one of us has the flare the nimbleness, the minds and the communication ability to be able to challenge this formidable campaigner. The work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd, who is backing Jeremy Hunt, is joining in the onslaught about Johnson\u2019s failure to face scrutiny. She retweeted a Sky News interview from last year when he backed the broadcasters campaign for TV debates with political leaders. These words will haunt the frontrunner unless he agrees to take part in the TV debates: \u201cMy feeling is that they are essential and the public does need to see interchange between their potential leaders\u201d. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt accused Boris Johnson of running scared from the media and preventing a wider debate in the Tory Party. In a personal attack on the Today programme Hunt contrasted Johnson\u2019s reluctance to face the media with his hero Winston Churchill. He said: \u201cWhat would Churchill say if somebody who wants to be prime minister of the United Kingdom is hiding away from the media and not taking part in these big occasions?\u201d He added: \u201cWe can only have that debate if our front-runner in this campaign is a little bit braver in terms of getting out into the media and actually engaging in debates. Engaging in the TV debates.\u201d Hunt said the government could \u201cdo better\u201d than Johnson\u2019s proposal of leaving the EU without a deal. My argument to the Conservative Party is: should we have someone who can at least try to get us some better choices? Because I think ultimately, it\u2019s very defeatist to say, the only way that we can leave the EU is is a route that is potentially highly damaging to businesses. I believe there is a deal to be done and I believe the package can be renegotiated but this is the debate we should be having. And this is the debate that our members want to have. And this is the debate I want to put to our members. We can only have that debate if our front runner in this campaign is a little bit braver in terms of getting out into the media, and actually engaging in debates, engaging in the TV debates. Hunt who came a distant second to Johnson in the ballot of Tory MPs also contrasted his own willingness to appear before the media to Johnson\u2019s public reticence. I think this is the 16th time I\u2019ve done this day programme in the last year, and he\u2019s just done it once. You give us a hard time but you\u2019re not monsters. And I think if you want to be prime minister of the United Kingdom, you have to get out there and make your case. Public hustings is not the same as the scrutiny of the media, the scrutiny of TV debates. This is about the prime minister of the United Kingdom. And he warned that Theresa May\u2019s unopposed election as leader in 2016 should not be repeated. What people are worried about is that we could be heading for a rerun of the 2016 campaign where we effectively had a coronation without a huge amount of scrutiny. I\u2019m going to turn this into a rerun of the 2005 campaign. Were a little run a little known outsider, David Cameron came in and turned the tables and that\u2019s the kind of real contest with proper scrutiny that we need to have. The chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum has compared Boris Johnson to Adolf Hitler and said he would quit the party if the former foreign secretary is elected as leader, PA reports. Mohammed Amin told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI am not prepared to be a member of a party that chooses him as its leader. \u201cI would resign after 36 years.\u201d Asked about Johnson\u2019s popularity with grassroots members of the party, Amin said: \u201cThere are many horrible people who have been popular. Popularity is not the test. \u201cThe test is, is this person sufficiently moral to be prime minister, and I believe he fails that test. A lot of Germans thought that Hitler was the right man for them.\u201d Told that that was a shocking comparison, Amin said: \u201cYes. I am not saying Boris Johnson wants to send people to the gas chamber, clearly he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s a buffoon. \u201cBut he, as far as I\u2019m concerned, has insufficient concern about the nature of truth for me to ever be a member of a party that he leads.\u201d Amin went on: \u201cWe don\u2019t expect our politicians, our prime ministers, to be saints. \u201cBut we do require a basic level of morality and integrity. And of all the candidates in the Conservative Party leadership election, Boris Johnson is the only one that I believe fails that test. Amin said a column Johnson wrote last August comparing women who wore burkas to \u201cletter boxes and bank robbers\u201d had put some Muslim women at risk. \u201cHe knew exactly what effect it would have - it would lead to Muslim women who wear niqab and burka being verbally abused on the streets; in certain cases being physically assaulted, with people trying to tear it off. He chose to mock Muslim women who wear niqab and burka for his own purposes.\u201d Welcome to a hastily cobbled together Friday edition of Politics Live. Conservative leadership candidates are in talks about joining forces to provide the strongest challenge to Boris Johnson. They are also trying to put pressure on Johnson to take part in the TV debates amid continuing signs he plans to duck them. Meanwhile, Rory Stewart, who came seventh in the first ballot of Tory MPs, now says he could serve in a Cabinet led by Boris Johnson after previously ruling that out. The international development secretary told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIf we ended up in a crisis, and I fear no-deal Brexit would be a crisis, and if he were to wish me to come back, which I think is a little doubtful given the slight acrimony of the last few weeks, then, of course, I\u2019d be honoured to serve.\u201d Also today: Chuka Umunna, who left Labour in February to found the Independent Group, has switched party once again and joined the Liberal Democrats. Sir John Major has launched a blistering assault on Tory leadership candidates who have suggested parliament could be prorogued to push through Brexit, saying they were indulging in \u201cgold-plated hypocrisy\u201d and lacked leadership qualities. And Britain\u2019s businesses are being urged to step up their preparations for a no-deal Brexit amid signs that Theresa May\u2019s successor could be prepared to leave the EU without a deal at the end of October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
