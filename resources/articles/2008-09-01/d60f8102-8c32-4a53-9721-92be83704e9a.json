If I could only take one with me it would probably be Beenleigh Blue - it's the best sheep's milk cheese in the world. I'd have to have a glass of wine, so I would say an Aloxe-Corton - I'd have a bottle of that. I'm not going to last very long on this desert island, am I? I'd take a pig with me, because I'd feel pretty confident making some ham, and a bit of pancetta and some bacon, so that would keep me going. What would you have for your last supper? I'd probably have an absolutely perfectly fresh mozzarella di buffalo. It would have to be flown in, having been made the day before. I would just have the merest drizzle of olive oil around the edge of the plate. I wouldn't have any tomatoes, I'd just have a big round ball that I would slice up and enjoy. Then I'd have a dish that I found a long time ago in one of Delia Smith's early books, a pheasant pot-roasted in cider with Cox's apples. It's a meal that my wife and I cook every two or three weeks during pheasant season. It's just an incredible meal. I'd have it with the most wonderful new potatoes and runner beans that are coming out of our garden at the moment. I'd finish with a plate of Beenleigh Blue and an absolutely ripe pear. What foodstuff would you put in Room 101? Celery. I love celeriac, but I can't stand celery. It makes me shudder - I hate it. And liver, which is a great shame. It's the result of being fed the most appalling liver at school, immediately after the second world war. As soon as I achieved sufficient independence I said \"Right, no more liver\". My wife tends to order it quite often when we eat out, and I sometimes taste it, but I still don't like it. Yet I love fois gras - but that's very politically incorrect now. What's your favourite table? I really do enjoy the food at Arbutus in Frith Street, because it's a nice twist on a lot of good, traditional English meats that you don't often see. They will sell you a small carafe of any of the wines they have, which means you can grace really good food with a really good wine. These days, I can't manage half a bottle of wine at lunchtime - I'd go to sleep in the afternoon. Here, you can have a glass-and-a-half each of really good wine - you don't have to stomach appalling house wine. If there's one gripe I've got, it's that too many restaurants still have the most appalling house wine. What's your poison? I enjoy wine enormously. My wife and I have a bottle every night of our lives. The only other alcoholic drink that we really indulge in - besides champagne \u2013 is averna, which is an amaro. We particularly like the one from Sicily. We call it Night Nurse, because it's a digestivo, and if you've eaten late, this settles your tummy and you have a really good night's sleep. It's beautiful. You must only have one, though - on holiday I had two and woke up with a rotten head. Which book gets you cooking? Delia Smith. I found myself a bachelor again in 1983, after I'd been horribly spoiled and lost the habit of cooking. I got a Delia book \u2013 she looks extraordinarily young on the front cover \u2013 and it's still on our shelf in the kitchen. She's got some really good traditional recipes, often with her own little twist. It's proper cooking. What's your dream dinner party line-up? I would have enjoyed the company of Noel Coward, because when the conversation lulled he could tell you the most fabulous stories about the people he's mixed with. An astronaut who'd walked on the moon would be brilliant. Sir Winston Churchill would be a fabulous dinner guest, and there'd be none of this modern-day nonsense about abusing alcohol, he'd just be encouraging us to have another glass of wine. I'm tempted to say Margaret Thatcher - I know that I'd end up having a flaming row with her, but it would be extraordinarily interesting. I really would loved to have met Marilyn Monroe. And, of course, my wife and I. What was your childhood teatime treat? Anything fresh from our garden. It set the pattern for my life, because my father always grew vegetables, and I learned from him. His asparagus bed was his pride and joy. If you've ever eaten asparagus a quarter of an hour after it's been cut from the asparagus bed, I tell you what - you lived. Seasonality is again terribly fashionable, but I have never, ever lost it. I have never wanted to have a strawberry out of the season. It's the same for my grandson and granddaughter, who are only six and four. The other day I whacked the fork into the ground and out came these wrinkly pink fir apple potatoes - they laughed like drains. Their sheer joy took me back 55 years. Kids of that age love vegetables as long as they actually taste of something. What would you cook to impress a date? I guess I'd go back to the pheasant, because I feel so confident doing it. I'm pretty damn sure that unless the person was vegetarian, they'd say: \"Wow, that's incredible\". What was your most memorable meal? I used to love Chez Nico at the Dorchester. I probably had my most memorable meal there with Glynn Christian. Nico came out and I said to him: \"That was just the best meal ever\". I can't remember what we had, because we proceeded to have rather too much wine, but I remember thinking how good it was. What was your biggest food disaster? Years ago I was trying to impress somebody, and I paid a lot of money for some very good steaks. I should have let the steaks speak for themselves, but I decided to go all arty-farty and created a sauce. The lady scraped all the sauce off and ate the steak without it - I took one bite and did the same. What's the worst meal you've ever had? A lamb shank in a hotel in Essex about ten years ago. I'd had a god-awful journey driving over there from Dorset. The lamb had clearly been pre-cooked by some wholesaler, and some chap had just rammed it into the microwave. It was just so unbelievably bad. It was the perfect example of what's wrong in the kitchen at so many hotels in this country: it's just recycled rubbish. What's the most outlandish thing you've ever eaten? In Egypt, we had spatch-cocked pigeons, which isn't in itself terribly unusual \u2013 other than the fact that there were no knives and forks. We were expected to pick it up and eat the lot, including the bone. It wasn't a pleasant sensation, crunching through bone. Who's your food hero/food villain? My food hero is currently Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. I think the guy deserves a knighthood for what he's doing. He's almost the only one who has not sold out to the supermarkets one iota. Yes, he wants to pay his mortgage and earn a living, but he's doing it without selling his soul in the way that almost all the others have. My villain is Sir Terry Leahy of Tesco, because he's single-handedly persuaded the British public that food should be cheap, and that we should spend the lowest percentage of our disposable household income of any European nation on food. We value what we put inside our bodies less than our plasma televisions, and it breaks my heart. Nigella or Delia? Delia before her last little thing, her How to Cheat. Vegetarians: genius or madness? Madness. Starter or pudding? Starter. But I love a cheeseboard - if it's not coming straight from the fridge, like most restaurants do. Fusion food or Best of British? That's an interesting one. I think I would go for fusion, only because there are big chunks of our so-called British heritage that I just don't enjoy that much: things like stews, Lancashire hotpots ... They work a lot better with the introduction of a couple of spices, which the traditional recipes wouldn't have. What's the best/worst thing about the British food scene? The worst is the celebrity chef culture, which is based on show business rather than trying to help people understand the basics of good food ingredients. Chefs should do so much more in teaching people how to source - not just saying \"Take a breast of chicken; take a leg of lamb\". They should be telling them that this dish works better if you buy a free-range chicken that's lived for 93 days, all that kind of stuff. The best thing is the vast numbers of the population that have been switched on to local food. What's the next big thing? It's already happening: people want to know provenance. How much it's happening in metropolitan areas I don't know, but around here [Devon] people want to know the farm where the meat comes from, they really do, and that's doing great things for the local farmshops. Thirteen years ago, our local butcher used to go up to Smithfields [market in London] and buy a hell of a lot. You walk in his shop now and he listing every single farm that he buys his pork, lamb and beef from. People are deeply worried about the fact that British farming is being decimated. We've lost half our dairy farmers; we're losing pig farmers by the drove. If that continues, everything will be imported, which, the way global warming is going, is not a very healthy place to be. I honestly think that the next big thing will be people saying: \"Where did that come from? Who made that?\" It will give the anonymity of supermarket own-label a kick up the backside, because they don't tell you anything - you've no idea where that stuff's made. They can cheat to their hearts content - they can even lie by telling you it's produced in Britain when all of the ingredients have come from abroad. If we could force them to name the producer, that would be good news. Make a wish I would love us to someone to wave a magic wand and make us adopt the Mediterranean approach to food, so lunch is resurrected and we don't eat as much in the evenings. The older I get, the more I realise that having the largest meal of the day in the evening is not good for us. In Spain, they'll start work at eight, finish at 3, have a big meal, and then they'll maybe just have a boiled egg or something before they go to bed. People who do that don't have problems with obesity. It'll never happen, but I think we'd all be a lot healthier and not quite as tubby. \u00b7 The Guild of Fine Food organises the annual Great Taste Awards, known as the Oscars of the food industry.
