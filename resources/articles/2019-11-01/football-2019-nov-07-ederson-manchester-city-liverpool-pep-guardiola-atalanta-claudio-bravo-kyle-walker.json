The Brazilian limped away from the stadium after the match. Pep Guardiola said he did not know if Ederson will recover but claimed no concern regarding having to start Claudio Bravo if required against the Premier League leaders at Anfield. \u201cHe\u2019s an incredible, experienced professional,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIf Ederson is ready, he is going to play. If not we will play Claudio. We trust him. Why should I doubt any players I have in my squad?\u201d Guardiola offered the stance despite Bravo\u2019s misjudgment causing his 81st-minute red card, as he rushed out and brought down Josip Ilicic. This was the second sending off in the Chilean\u2019s City career, the first coming for handling outside the area against Barcelona three years ago. Regarding Ederson\u2019s prospective fitness, Guardiola said: \u201cIt is a muscular problem \u2013 not big, it was a risk, he didn\u2019t feel comfortable and that\u2019s why we decided to make a substitution.\u201d The manager indicated the thigh area as being the region of Ederson\u2019s problem. \u201cHe\u2019s strong and we\u2019ll try with him but we won\u2019t take a risk but we\u2019ll see tomorrow.\u201d Bravo\u2019s previous league start was at Southampton in May 2018 in what was a dead game as City were already champions. Kyle Walker, brought on for Riyad Mahrez, replaced Bravo in goal. Guardiola said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t think before but Xabi Mancisidor [City\u2019s goalkeeping coach] suggested him, for his courage and he\u2019s quick. He went in and it was just one shot on target [from a Ruslan Malinovskiy free-kick]. Congratulations to him for his courage, the desire to help the team.\u201d Walker, who occasionally joins in goalkeeping training, said: \u201cDid I volunteer? It was a little bit of both. Sometimes I criticise our goalkeepers for not catching the ball in training but as I found tonight sometimes you have to take two touches.\u201d The last remark referred to him requiring two gathers of Malinovskiy\u2019s late free\u2011kick. City require one point to confirm qualification to the Champions League knockout round. After Raheem Sterling\u2019s seventh-minute opener, Gabriel Jesus missed a penalty near half-time, before Mario Pasalic\u2019s equaliser following the interval."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
