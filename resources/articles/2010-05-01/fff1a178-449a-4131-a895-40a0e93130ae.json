An exhausting, exhilarating day for the mothers' day carnival crowd at Kensington Oval finished with an overwhelming 81-run win for Michael Clarke's side over Sri Lanka, potential winners themselves at the start, which merely served to stress the muscular physical nature that Australia have brought to the tournament. Challenged to make 169 to win, Sri Lanka effectively lost the match inside the first seven overs against the pace bowling of Dirk Nannes, Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson, who between them took the wicket of the totem Mahela Jayawardene in the third over and five for 49 by the time Johnson had completed a double-wicket first over. Recovery from that sort ofposition is by no means unlikely, as the Australians themselves showed, but Sri Lanka's big guns were gone. Johnson finished the match with 16 balls still remaining. The Australian win, if enforced by the virility of pace bowling, had been set up by a remarkable unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 101 from 55 balls between Cameron White (83 not out) and Mike Hussey (39 not out). Until they came together Sri Lanka had been in control of the match, as Angelo Mathews and Suraj Randiv, a tall offspinner who can extract considerable turn and bounce, had reduced Australia to 67 for five by the end of the 11th over. The bowling had been tight, the fielding from the brilliant stop at point as Shane Watson leathered the opening ball of the match good. The convention of a batting order has been torn up in T20, though. Now an innings is backloaded with some of the heaviest artillery. The last four or five overs can be brutal for bowlers as sixes are strong-armed where once tailenders heaved. White is a big fellow and a burly clean hitter, Hussey more clinical but capable of big shots himself. By the end of the 16th over the pair had repaired the damage to the extent that, at 106 for five, while Sri Lanka might have had visions of restriction, there was potential for some free hitting. White had already reached his half-century from 32 balls but loosened his shoulders, 35 more coming from 17 deliveries, while Hussey took only 26 balls. The last four overs produced 62 runs. With a stunning catch at backward point White was a man-of-the- match formality. Earlier West Indies' captain, Chris Gayle, struck a powerful 98 to lead his team to a 14-run victory over India. West Indies can reach the semi-finals with victory over Australia tomorrow but defeat left India facing almost certain elimination after their second defeat in the Super Eights stage. Gayle played with a combination of prudence and power, his 66-ball knock ending when he was run out in the final over, two short of what would have been his second century in a Twenty20 international. The total of 169 for six was a challenging one and India were never up with the run-rate despite a good knock of 32 from Suresh Raina and an aggressive 29 from 18 balls from the captain, MS Dhoni. They finished on 155 for nine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
