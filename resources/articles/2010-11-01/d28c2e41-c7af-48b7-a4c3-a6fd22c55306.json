Regardless of the convoluted maths (more of which later, class), Murray has a tricky assignment. While Murray's form has swung from brilliant to bad in Greenwich this week \u2013 he dismissed Robin Soderling on Sunday and folded like a lettuce against Roger Federer yesterday \u2013 his opponent's game went the other way. Ferrer survived a first\u2011round drubbing by Federer only to give Soderling a fright in the second round. The Spaniard, a most unusual man, is not so much the elephant in the room as the dark horse stretching for the finish line. Not only has he dragged himself back into the top 10 this year for the first time since 2008, but he carries with him a (literally) dark secret. As a teenage prodigy in J\u00e1vea, Ferrer, now 28, suffered badly from self-doubtand disinterest, a problem that his coach, Javier Piles, rectified in dramatic fashion. \"When he didn't want to work,\" Piles told the ATP website, \"I would lock him up in a dark room of two by two metres and I would put a lock on it so he couldn't get out. I would give him a piece of bread and a bottle of water through the bars of a small window.\" Not unsurprisingly, perhaps, this convinced Ferrer there were more pleasant ways to get through his teens and he quit to become a construction worker. When he returned to the game he was clearly made for, he had at least gained some perspective \u2013 and maybe a fear of enclosed spaces. On court, he is a bundle of energy, eyes blazing, feet and fists twitching on the baseline. \"He's a really tough player,\" said Murray, who lost to him on clay in Rome this year, then again on the dirt of Madrid, each time in straight sets. \"He's incredibly consistent.\" Consistency is what separates them, as well as two places in the world rankings; Ferrer, ranked No7, does not have the sort of nightmare dips that haunt Murray's game. The ATP, keen not to repeat the confusion of last year when Murray won two matches and went out, today issued a helpful guide to the 10 scenarios that might unfold. The bizarre losing-but-winning options for Murray are these: \u2022 If Federer beats Soderling in two sets and Ferrer beats Murray in three sets, Federer qualifies as group winner and Murray goes through as runner-up. \u2022 If Federer beats Soderling in three sets and Ferrer wins against Murray in three sets, Federer goes through \u2013 and so does Murray. \u2022 On the other hand (stay awake at the back), Murray could beat Ferrer in three sets but would go out if Soderling beat Federer in two sets. If it comes down to the number of games won, we might have a repeat of last year's entertainment when Federer, Murray and Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro each won two matches \u2013 but Murray went out (while tweeting in confusion at home in Surrey) by one game. Murray will not want to leave it to chance this time. All he can do is strive for an emphatic victory \u2013 even though he will have the luxury of knowing when he goes on court exactly what he needs to do to get through to the weekend. \"I have to serve well against him and get some free points,\" Murray said. \"That will be the main thing I'm looking to improve [after losing to Federer].\" That and his return. His wayward serve was a surprise yesterday \u2013 but the collapse of his return was what prompted Federer to admit afterwards that he was \"a little bit shocked\". Hardly anyone hits a serve back more efficiently than Murray and it took Federer's genius to neutralise that part of his game, as the world No5 could not impart energy on the Swiss's under-powered ground strokes. On the other side of the draw, Tomas Berdych today all but snuffed out Andy Roddick's charge. Both lost on Monday, but the Czech was more in control of his game here, pulling away in the end to win 7-5, 6-3. Roddick smashed a racket at 3-2 down in the second and confessed: \"I was angry with myself and there wasn't anybody else to talk to.\" He could do with a spell in Ferrer's cell, maybe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
