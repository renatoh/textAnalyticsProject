Intense workloads are leaving emergency department personnel exhausted, stressed and worried that they have missed clues about a patient\u2019s condition because their units are so overwhelmed. NHS leaders have spoken out in the wake of new official figures showing that delays for A&amp;E care, and number of patients getting stuck on trolleys as they wait for a bed in hospital, are at their worst ever level. Experts said the NHS\u2019s performance against key waiting time targets \u2013 for A&amp;E care, access to GPs, cancer care and planned operations \u2013 is now at previously \u201cunthinkable\u201d depths. \u201cYou constantly find yourself apologising to patients in the emergency department for a lack of beds, the availability of other teams or specialist staff and of course the time they\u2019ve had to spend waiting. \u2018Sorry you\u2019ve had a long wait\u2019 is possibly the phrase most used by [A&amp;E] staff and it can wear you down\u201d, said Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&amp;E doctors. While A&amp;E doctors are very skilled at assessing patients and making decisions quickly \u201cthe constant pressure to see the next patient [means] you often worry that you may have taken decisions too fast,\u201d she said. \u201cThis can tend to haunt people and seep into your mind when you are off shift and meant to be recuperating.\u201d Dave Smith, chair of the Royal College of Nursing\u2019s Emergency Care Association, which represents A&amp;E nurses, said: \u201cNurses are exhausted, physically and mentally, by the relentlessness of the job. Treating people on the floor, in corridors, in chairs and in waiting rooms \u2013 that\u2019s not what they came into nursing for. \u201cNurses are the darlings of the NHS. But they\u2019re frustrated that they can\u2019t give patients the quality of care their vocation demands and that they\u2019re giving substandard care because there\u2019s no space [in A&amp;E units] to look after the patients. Imagine downtown Tokyo or Oxford Street on a busy day and it\u2019s like that.\u201d Dedicated A&amp;E staff are also frustrated that understaffing and the sheer weight of demand meant their hard work, including unpaid overtime, was not enough to ensure patients were treated on time, Henderson and Smith both also said. The NHS\u2019s increasing inability to meet almost any of the raft of key waiting time standards has emerged as a major challenge for Boris Johnson. NHS experts and staff leaders called on him to deliver on his promises of more nurses and extra money for new hospitals as soon as possible. In December hospital-based A&amp;Es only managed to treat and then admit, transfer or discharge 68.6% of arrivals within four hours. That was the smallest proportion in any month since the target was created in 2004 and the first time performance has slipped below 70%. Hospitals are meant to deal with 95% of patients in that timeframe. In all, 98,452 patients also spent at least four hours on a trolley in an A&amp;E as they waited for hospital staff to find them a bed. The 2,347 of those who waited at least 12 hours on a trolley was a new record and eight times the 284 who did so in December 2018. \u201cThese figures are truly alarming. How many more wake-up calls does the government need?\u201d, said Dr Simon Walsh, the British Medical Association\u2019s emergency medicine lead. \u201cMissed targets are now the norm,\u201d said Prof John Appleby, chief economist at the Nuffield Trust thinktank. The latest set of grim performance statistics also showed that: In November, 17,500 people with suspected cancer did not get to see a specialist for the first time within two weeks of being referred by their GP. Over 3,000 patients with cancer did not have \u201curgent\u201d treatment within two months. The number of people waiting for a nonurgent procedure in hospital such as a new hip or knee or cataract removal remains unchanged at 4.5 million. However, one in six people have already waited more than the supposed maximum of 18 weeks \u2013 the highest percentage since 2008. In November, 4,863 hospital beds a day were occupied by people who were fit to be discharged but had not left, slightly fewer than the month before. In another sign of the intense strain on services, a total of 81,012 patients in England have had to remain with ambulance personnel for at least half an hour because of delays in handing them over to staff in an A&amp;E department in the five weeks since winter began. That is the highest number since records began in 2017-18. Of those, 21,663 were forced to wait for at least an hour \u2013 again the most ever recorded by the NHS. Delayed handovers mean fewer ambulances are available to respond to 999 calls. In addition, 58 people have died of flu in the UK since the start of October \u2013 the second highest total in the last seven years \u2013 the latest figures from Public Health England showed. Asked about the figures, a spokesman for No 10 said \u201cwinter is always challenging\u201d, and added that Johnson is giving the NHS a \u201crecord cash boost\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 January 2020 to correctly attribute a quote to Dr Simon Walsh."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
