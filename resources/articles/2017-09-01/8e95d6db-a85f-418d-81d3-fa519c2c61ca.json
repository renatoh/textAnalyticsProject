In a statement released on Tuesday, Lucasfilm praised the director but added that they had \u201cmutually chosen\u201d to part ways on the project. \u201cLucasfilm and Colin Trevorrow have mutually chosen to part ways on Star Wars: Episode IX. Colin has been a wonderful collaborator throughout the development process but we have all come to the conclusion that our visions for the project differ. \u201cWe wish Colin the best and will be sharing more information about the film soon,\u201d the statement read. Trevorrow was originally confirmed as the director for the finale of the latest Star Wars trilogy in August 2015, after the success of Jurassic World, which took $1.6bn at the box office. The director made his name with the 2012 sci-fi dramedy Safety Not Guaranteed, before impressing Hollywood with Jurassic World, but his latest effort, The Book of Henry, was poorly received critically. Trevorrow\u2019s departure is the second high-profile directorial departure in the Star Wars universe in recent months, after the duo of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were replaced by Ron Howard on the Han Solo spin off movie after \u201ccreative differences\u201d. A replacement for Trevorrow has not been confirmed. The film is due to be released in May 2019. The next Star Wars film to hit screens will be Rian Johnson\u2019s Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which is due out in mid-December this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
