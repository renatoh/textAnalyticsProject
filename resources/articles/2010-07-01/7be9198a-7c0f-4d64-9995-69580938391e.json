The latest is Milton Keynes and it's not doing anything by halves. Using the city's singular urban landscape, creative producer Bill Gee has melded new commissions and UK premieres that include Fran\u00e7ois Delarozi\u00e8re's spectacular installation The Magical Menagerie (to 8 Aug), a gigantic square carousel of oversized mythical creatures that you can ride. Other theatrical highlights include inStallation, a big-top show from a Swiss collective of aerial arts and dance performers (17-24 Jul); the World Famous' pyrotechnic piece, Full Circle (Sat); and the excellent Graeae/Strange Fruit show, Against The Tide (23-25 Jul), a hit at last year's Greenwich and Docklands festival. Various venues, Fri to 25 Jul, ifmiltonkeynes.org Lyn Gardner Hotel Medea, London Now this one is really for the night owls, or insomniacs; certainly not the faint-hearted. Hotel Medea is a new, not to say irreverent take on the Greek myth that turns it into a Brazilian street party. Yes, it's more than five hours long and, yes, it kicks off at 11pm. An interactive promenade performance, it's the creation of Para Active, an intercultural theatre project based in east London, and Zecora Ura Theatre, which works in London and Rio de Janeiro on site-specific, time-specific and audience-specific shows. Added to that mix is acclaimed Brazilian musician, DJ Dolores, who's worked with David Byrne and the Beastie Boys and won the BBC World Music Award. So, after travelling on a ferry from the O2 to Trinity Buoy Wharf, punters can expect loud music, quasi-religious ritual cabaret, video technology and cocoa. Like you'll get any sleep. Starts North Greenwich Pier, E14, Fri to 7 Aug Mark Cook Britain's Got Bhangra, Leeds The Theatre Royal Stratford East's quest to find new talent and create a very different, British, kind of musical that breaks away from the tired old Broadway mould is having some success. Already its got the hugely successful The Harder They Come out on tour, and now that's joined by this new musical that brings an Asian beat and a Bollywood swagger into its story following the changing fortunes of an Indian immigrant over 30 years in Britain. West Yorkshire Playhouse, Tue to 17 Jul Lyn Gardner Copacabana, Newbury Yes, it's the Barry Manilow musical directed by Craig Revel Horwood, him off TV's Strictly Come Dancing. That combination may have some screaming in horror but this comes from the same production team that's had hits with revivals of both Sunset Boulevard and Spend, Spend, Spend so there are grounds for optimism. Dancing should be the main draw in what's a fairly cliched story of a smalltown lovely looking for a big break in New York City. The Watermill, Bagnor, Thu to 4 Sep Lyn Gardner Riverside Studios' Best Of Edinburgh Previews, London Get the heads-up on what's happening in Edinburgh this summer with this pre-festival programme of previews. Comedy dominates this week with new shows from Paul Chowdhry, Loretta Maine and Gordon Southern but there's one-woman drama, Colours, too (Wed). Later in the month come Frisky And Mannish, an up-and-coming cabaret duo with a twisted take on pop; after their much-praised show, School Of Pop, they present Frisky And Mannish: The College Years (26-29 Jul). Wonderland (29 Jul-1 Aug) is a new musical comedy about the untold story of Lewis Carroll and the actress who played Alice on stage, written by Gyles Brandreth. Abi Titmuss, who really is becoming known for her acting, will star in John Godber's rugby comedy Up'n'Under (26 &amp; 27 Jul), and Gutted: A Revenger's The Musical (26 &amp; 27 Jul) will feature high-profile comedians to be announced. Riverside Studios, W6, Tue to 1 Aug Mark Cook The Good Soldier, Bath With restoration taking place in the main theatre, the Theatre Royal moves into the more intimate Ustinov for this adaptation of Ford Madox Ford's novel about the disintegration of two marriages before the first world war. It's adapted by Julian Mitchell (of Another Country fame) who has already done a version for TV. It will be interesting to see how he deals with Ford's unreliable narrator device. The story is told from the perspective of John Dowell who, holidaying in Nauheim with his wife Florence in 1904, meet Edward and Leonora, with whom they become firm friends. But beneath the Edwardian faces of order, passions and intrigue seethe, leading to later tragedy. Matthew Lloyd directs a story that Ford initially called The Saddest Story. The Ustinov, Wed to 14 Aug Lyn Gardner The Critic/The Real Inspector Hound, Chichester Sheridan may have been an 18th-century playwright and Stoppard a star of the 20th and 21st centuries, but in their merciless humour and quick-witted wordplay they have much in common. So this double bill, directed by Chichester's artistic director, Jonathan Church, should be a witty, grown-up pleasure that pricks the balloon of pretentiousness. Possibly not for theatre critics, though, who may squirm in their seats. Theatrical convention and critical pomposity are lampooned in Sheridan's The Critic, which features theatre writers Dangle and Sneer; while in Stoppard's The Real Inspector Hound, theatre and reality blur when critics Moon and Birdboot blunder out of the auditorium and into the plot of a whodunit. Minerva, to 28 Aug Lyn Gardner The Mikado, Scarborough It's a return match for Chris Monks's cricket-inspired version of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, previously seen at the New Vic, Newcastle under Lyme, and Richmond's Orange Tree. Monks will be hoping that Scarborough audiences are bowled over by his production, set on the field of the Titpu Cricket Club. In fact, cricket is something of a theme in Scarborough this season, where one of the off-peak offerings \u2013 playing in a double bill with Caryl Churchill's A Number (to 28 Aug) \u2013 is James Quinn's comedy, Twenty:20. As the title might suggest, it features a Twenty:20 cricket superstar called Rick Fielding who has never played Test cricket but is called up to represent England in a grudge test against Australia. While many theatres take a break during the summer, Scarborough is at its busiest as it tries to entice audiences from the beach and into the ground. Sorry, I mean theatre.
