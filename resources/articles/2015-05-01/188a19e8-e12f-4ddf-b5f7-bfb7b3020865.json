The European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said on Tuesday that she was examining claims, made by trade unions, that McDonald\u2019s paid just \u20ac16m of tax on royalties worth \u20ac3.7bn between 2009 and 2013. \u201cWe are looking into the information gained by trade unions when it comes to McDonald\u2019s in order to assess if there is a case, or if we should open cases there,\u201d Vestager said. McDonald\u2019s is accused of channelling money through a Luxembourg-based subsidiary with a Swiss branch to exploit a generous tax break on intellectual property rights. It is a similar structure to that used by a host of multinationals exposed by the Guardian\u2019s LuxLeaks investigation last year. The trade unions claim that McDonald\u2019s Luxembourg subsidiary employs just 13 people, yet booked \u20ac834m of revenue in 2013 \u2013 which would work out at more than \u20ac64m per worker. Heidi Barker, a spokeswoman for McDonald\u2019s, which on Monday promised to transform itself into a more modern, progressive and transparent burger company, said: \u201cWe will decline to comment on your inquiry.\u201d The commission has already opened investigations into the tax affairs of Amazon in Luxembourg, Apple in Ireland and Starbucks in the Netherlands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
