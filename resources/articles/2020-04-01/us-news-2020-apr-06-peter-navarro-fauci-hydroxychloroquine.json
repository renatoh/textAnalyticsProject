Fauci, 79, has been director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. Navarro, 70 and a leading China hawk behind much of Donald Trump\u2019s hardline trade policy, said he was qualified to debate the use of hydroxychloroquine with Fauci because he has a PhD \u2013 in economics. The president has repeatedly said Americans concerned about the virus should take hydroxychloroquine, which is commonly used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Fauci has repeatedly said there is no clinical evidence it can help against Covid-19 and evidence of the drug\u2019s efficacy is anecdotal. At the White House briefing on Sunday night, Trump intervened to stop his adviser answering a question about the drug. Trump also said the federal government had stockpiled about 29m doses. The same evening, reports emerged that Navarro got into a verbal fight with Fauci at a coronavirus taskforce meeting in the White House Situation Room on Saturday. Speaking to CNN on Monday, Navarro acknowledged the disagreement and said he told Fauci in response to his concerns about the anecdotal nature of evidence regarding hydroxychloroquine: \u201cI would have two words for you: \u2018second opinion\u2019.\u201d Navarro told CNN that studies including one published in the last few days involving Wuhan, China prove hydroxychloroquine can help coronavirus patients recover. Navarro said the Wuhan study was one of the first randomized in a control group. The trade adviser also claimed his PhD in economics qualified him to have such debates with health experts like Fauci. \u201cDoctors disagree about things all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cMy qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I\u2019m a social scientist. I have a PhD, and I understand how to read statistical studies.\u201d At the White House briefing on Sunday, Trump was asked if he should be \u201cplaying doctor\u201d by pushing an unproven drug. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work, great,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work \u2026 it doesn\u2019t kill people.\u201d In March, an Arizona man died after he and his wife took chloroquine phosphate, an additive used to clean fish tanks that is also found in hydroxychloroquine. \u201cTrump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,\u201d the man\u2019s wife told NBC. The federal government has approved clinical trials in New York and given doctors emergency dispensation to prescribe the drug for coronavirus patients. Navarro told CNN that at Saturday\u2019s meeting \u201cthere was unanimous agreement that [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] would immediately begin surging hydroxy into the hot zones to be dispensed only between a doctor and a patient decision not the federal government\u201d. At the White House on Saturday, Trump said he might take hydroxychloroquine himself \u2013 though he would have to ask his doctors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
