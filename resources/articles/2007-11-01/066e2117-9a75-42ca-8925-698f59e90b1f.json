Lately I've been fascinated by those from Dixons Store Group and other retailers for the latest generation of really big hard drives. \"750GB!\" say the ads. \"Enough to store 150 movies!\" The people who write the ad copy have clearly decided that to describe them in terms of the number of three-minute songs (ie 3MB chunks) you could store on them is pointless: \"can store up to 166,000 songs!\" doesn't mean very much, because nobody can imagine what it would be like to own 166,000 songs. (If they're all three minutes, that's about 8,300 hours, or 347 days.) So instead they describe how many movies they can store. Except ... whose movies? As the law stands, it's illegal to make a backup of a DVD film that you've bought, rented or otherwise acquired - something I checked with Lavinia Carey, director-general of the British Video Association. \"When you buy a DVD, you buy the right to the performance in the way it has been presented,\" she explains. \"It's like when you go to a cinema - what you pay doesn't entitle you to make a camcorder copy, even for your own use.\" Even making backup duplicates of DVDs you've bought so that your children won't ruin the original by putting sticky fingers all over it isn't legal. It's illegal to rip the DVD and transfer its contents to a hard drive that could store, ooh, another 149 like it, and play that back through a media streaming device, computer or console linked to that hard drive. So if doing that is illegal, why do DSG and others advertise these drives' ability to store so much data in terms of \"movies\"? (DSG said it's OK \"for personal use\" if you record from the TV.) I think it's a sort of technology realpolitik: the retailers know that the smarter of their customers know how to make copies of films; the software is out there, and the reasons for putting films on hard drives range from the sensible (stream what you've bought to computers or consoles around the house) to the illegal (making pirate copies for car boot sales). Though the BVA doesn't like it - and has tried to press the advertisers not to use phrases like \"movies\" - the fact is that this toothpaste, too, is out of the tube. It's illegal, after all, to rip your CDs and put them on a digital music player; and look how successful the music business has been at stopping that. Missing Leopard Jack Schofield pointed out here last week that Apple's financial results last quarter were dramatic; its European Mac sales grew by 47% compared to the previous year, which means there must be more Apple users in the UK than ever before. Meanwhile, some readers expressed surprise that we didn't have an in-depth review of the latest version of OSX, dubbed \"Leopard\", on these pages last week, ahead of last Friday's release. \"You must have had an advance copy,\" scolded one. Actually, no. For its previous two releases, Apple provided me with an advance copy; this time it didn't. Since it's easy to squirt a few bits over a phone line and burn a disc, why did Apple think that the biggest newspaper site in the UK shouldn't do an in-depth review of its new product ahead of time? Was it scared we would be too impartial and point to broken promises (no wireless backups to hard drives attached to its Airport wireless networks, promised in summer, yet missing in the final version) or criticise unnecessary eye-candyish changes (no matter, the rest of the web is busy doing that)? Or does it think customers in the UK are unimportant? Perhaps someone at Apple will write and explain. Meanwhile, read our online review."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
