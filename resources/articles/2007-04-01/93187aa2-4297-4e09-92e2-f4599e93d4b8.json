They are the bedrock of a strong economy and a sustainable environment. A child's education depends more on what's going on in their family than what's going on at school. For older people, the family is the frontline of their care. Yet the public policy response on the family has, in my view, often got it wrong in two ways. One version - currently pursued by the Conservative leader David Cameron - is a lecture by politicians about what sort of family life you should have. It doesn't work. People will not stay happy in their marriage because a politician tells them to. Most people want their marriage to work, and a political rebuke - or a tax penalty - when it doesn't is the last thing they need. And politicians can't lecture about the model family since politicians have as much difficulty conforming to the ideal as anyone else. We should have a new secretary of state for the family. But they should not be wagging a finger - they should be listening to families and looking across government to ensure that all policies from all departments support the family. The way things are currently, families are too far down the line, their voice too weak when decisions are made. And that's the second way politics gets the family wrong. The health secretary must listen to doctors and nurses. The education secretary must listen to teachers. That is made easier by the unions, professional associations and institutional structures. But there are no such organisations for parents. We need to compensate for that with special procedures. So, just as you can only take forward government policy if you have a \"regulatory impact statement\" that sets out the effect on business, and just as every bill must have a certificate on its human rights compliance, the secretary of state should require a \"family impact statement\" on all government policy. And what about having families and parents slotted into our parliamentary scrutiny. If a bill will affect them - whether it's about GPs, secondary schools or coroners - we should have a reality check in the legislative system. It is easy to hear from professional organisations but a pre-legislative scrutiny in the House of Commons by parents and families would help us know whether we've got it right. Government sets national policy but it is at local level where most of the services and decisions which affect families are. Many councils have designated councillors for economic regeneration, for children, for the elderly. But what about a designated councillor for the family whose job it would be to be a contact point for parents, to listen to what they have to say, to look at how each council service helps families. The lead councillor for parents and families would be an important partner for the secretary of state for the family. For too long, politics has either wagged a finger at families or just let them get on with things while we focused on institutions. The family is the most important institution for wellbeing, for equality and opportunity. It's time our structures worked to ensure that that is recognised. \u00b7 Harriet Harman is the constitutional affairs minister \u00b7 Email your comments to society@theguardian.com.
