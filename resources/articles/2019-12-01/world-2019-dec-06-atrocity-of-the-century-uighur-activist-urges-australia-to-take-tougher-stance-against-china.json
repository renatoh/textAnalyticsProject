Abbas, who met with MPs in Canberra on Thursday and held a roundtable at the US Embassy on the plight of the Uighur Muslim minority in western China\u2019s Xinjiang province, said that \u201cmodern day\u201d concentration camps holding as many as 3 million Uighurs were a case of \u201chistory repeating itself\u201d. The Liberal MP Andrew Hastie sparked a storm of controversy when he penned an opinion piece in the Nine newspapers in August, comparing the west\u2019s complacency about China to France\u2019s response to the rise of authoritarian Germany in the lead up to the second world war. Abbas, the executive director of the Campaign for Uyghurs, said she strongly backed the comparison, saying the first German concentration camps were built in 1933 while the country was still trading with other democratic countries. The first Uighur camp was built in 2014, Abbas said. \u201cMost of the economically independent or rich countries, they continued to do business with Germany, they enabled Germany\u2019s economy to murder more people,\u201d Abbas said. \u201cGreat Britain \u2013 they continued to do business with Nazi Germany at that time \u2013 what happened? They were then faced with the bombers flying over London. That\u2019s exactly the same thing happening right now. Continuing to do business with China is enabling China\u2019s economy to be the threat to the world community \u2026 its democracy and values. \u201cContinuing to do business with China is enabling China to murder my people.\u201d Abbas, whose sister and aunt were both abducted and detained in camps a week after she first went public as an advocate in the US in late 2018, said Uighurs were being detained because \u201cour religion, our culture, our language is being targeted as a mental ideological disease\u201d. \u201c[It is] not just the 3 million people in the concentration camps facing mental and physical torture, forced intense indoctrinations, forced medications, food and sleep deprivation, [but] even the people at large \u2026 living outside, are facing a complete surveillance police state.\u201d Abbas said she had not heard from her sister since she was abducted, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t even know if my sister is still alive.\u201d There are 17 Australian residents who are believed to be under house arrest, in prison or detained in the secretive \u201cre-education\u201d camps, Guardian Australia revealed in February. Labelling the mass detention of Uighurs as the \u201cunprecedented atrocity of the century\u201d, Abbas hit out at western countries, including Australia, for being too timid in the face of China\u2019s authoritarianism. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201c[This] is the largest incarceration of one ethnic group since the Holocaust, since world war two \u2013 why we are not getting much attention in the international media? \u201cIt\u2019s because China is using its economy and the market for silencing the world population. \u201cChina has become a power able to strong-arm the world \u2026 and with all that they are actually successfully silencing the world communities,\u201d she said. She urged Australia to do more to raise human rights concerns in its dealings with China, saying the west could use its combined economic might to pressure China. She also called for the international community not to \u201creward\u201d China with the hosting rights for the Winter Olympics in 2022 and the FIFA World Cup in 2021. \u201cFreedom is not free \u2013 any kind of doing the right thing comes with a price,\u201d Abbas said. \u201cYes, there might be some economic burden, but when it comes down to what is right, and when it comes down to the basic rights of human beings that is endangered right now \u2026 we shouldn\u2019t be only shortsighted to see the economy today, or next year or next five years.\u201d She also called for the establishment of a Uighur friendship group and for Australia to advance its own version of the US Magnitsky Act, which would impose sanctions on individuals who commit gross human rights abuses. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, has tasked parliament\u2019s joint standing committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade to conduct an inquiry into Australia\u2019s legal standing in response to international human rights abuses. Such legislation has already gained support from the Labor senator Kimberley Kitching and the Liberal senator James Paterson. Last month, Payne labelled reports of China\u2019s mass internment of Uighurs as \u201cdisturbing\u201d and called on China to end arbitrary detention, following leaked internal Chinese government documents which included directives from the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to \u201cshow absolutely no mercy\u201d in the \u201cstruggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism\u201d. Abbas also called on the Australian government to do more to prevent the \u201charassment and surveillance\u201d of the 3,000-strong Uighur community in Australia. \u201cThey are feeling threatened for their own safety and for their relatives back home,\u201d Abbas said. On the call to strip China of the Olympic Games hosting rights, Abbas also pointed to the historical comparison of Berlin\u2019s hosting of the 1936 Olympic Games, which at the time faced calls for a boycott, and was used by the Nazi regime as a platform for rampant nationalist propaganda. \u201cThe Olympic Games is a celebration of the differences and unity in the world, bringing together all different regions, different nations \u2026 a country holding 3 million innocent people because of their race and religion is the last country qualified to host such a game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
