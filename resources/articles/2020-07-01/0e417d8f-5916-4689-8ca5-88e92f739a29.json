Spurs are destined to finish sixth or seventh following their trip to Crystal Palace on Sunday, with their Europa League qualification hopes hinging on results elsewhere, but the manager maintains the league table obscures the quality of his work. \u201cIf this is about individuals and my individual approach, I\u2019m fourth in the league,\u201d a relaxed Mourinho said in answer to a question as to whether he still ranked among the world\u2019s best managers. \u201cIf you think I need to show something, OK I\u2019m going to try,\u201d said the Portuguese, who has collected 25 senior trophies in four different countries. \u201cI arrive [when the team were] 14th, eight points difference to Arsenal but if the league starts then no problem. And, if you want to laugh with me, I am the champion of the last five matches.\u201d Indeed a Spurs side who had collected a modest 14 points from 12 games under Pochettino, and were 11 points in arrears of fourth place when Mourinho took over, have returned from lockdown in particularly strong form. With Harry Kane restored to attack following hamstring surgery in January, Spurs have won five games, drawn two and endured only one defeat, softening the memory of some of their early teething troubles under Mourinho. Overall, Tottenham\u2019s record during the 25 league games of his tenure has been bettered only by Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United but he does not want to dwell on what might have been. \u201cMy most important season is the next one,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI look forward to next season, that\u2019s my mission.\u201d Mourinho \u2013 set to welcome back Dele Alli from injury and Eric Dier from suspension \u2013 is confident he will be able to strengthen his squad during the summer and has received boardroom assurances there is no need to sell before he can buy. \u201cI think we\u2019re going in the right direction. Very calm, organised, thinking well, measured, thinking of everything. We are very balanced, we\u2019re together. Step by step we\u2019ll end with a better, more balanced squad than we have now; keeping the great players we have is a very important thing.\u201d The tactical analyst Ricardo Formosinho will leave the club at the end of the season and Mourinho said his replacement had \u201ca history and connection with the club\u201d. He did not say who it was but Ledley King, who has an ambassadorial role, is in talks to join the club in a new position."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
