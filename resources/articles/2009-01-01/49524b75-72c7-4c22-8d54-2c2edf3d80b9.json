That account was provided by a person briefed on pilot Chesley B \"Sully\" Sullenberger's radio communications after his Airbus A320 apparently struck birds as he climbed to 1,500ft (457m) after takeoff from LaGuardia airport. The person, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the investigation, gave this account: When Sullenberger advised his controller at the New York TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach Control Center) of the \"double bird strike,\" the controller gave him a heading to return to LaGuardia and told him Runway 13 was open, but Sullenberger replied: \"unable.\" By \"double bird strike,\" controllers believed Sullenberger meant that both his jet engines had been damaged by bird impacts. Then Sullenberger saw an airstrip in the northern New Jersey suburbs, asked what it was and if he could go there. The controller told him it was Teterboro, which is a smaller field that serves mainly commuter and private planes. The controller gave him clearance to make an emergency landing on Teterboro's Runway 1. But Sullenberger again replied: \"unable.\" It was not immediately clear whether Sullenberger had by then decided he could not reach Teterboro or that he would not be able to apply the reverse thrusters on his jets to safely stop the aircraft on the Teterboro runway. The pilot then advised the controller he was going into the Hudson River. The TRACON notified New York harbour authorities of the imminent ditching."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
