Six saxophones and a rhythm section, it is led by the benignly hyperactive Derek Nash, who not only plays here, but composed all nine pieces on the album and runs the studio where it was recorded. When you have some of the sharpest players on the London scene you must show them off, which he does, but his tunes are catchy too, especially the title track. Jules Holland raises a riot, guesting on the irresistibly cheerful Sticky Finger Boogie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
