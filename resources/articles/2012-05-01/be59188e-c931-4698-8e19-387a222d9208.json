Boards from Barclays to Aviva and AstraZeneca to Trinity Mirror have been taking a bit of a slapping from shareholders lately and it will all kick off again this week with a busy schedule of annual meetings. So far, much of the dissent looks to have shocked British boardrooms, but this week provides a slight twist as we can sit back and watch some experienced professionals at work with the annual meeting on Tuesday of William Hill. The bookie knows all about pay revolts \u2013 an impressive 38% of investors chose not to back 2010's remuneration report, which showed chief executive Ralph Topping's total pay rose by 56% to \u00a31.65m. These votes are advisory, meaning the company pondered the poll and then swiftly ignored shareholders, instead immediately handing Topping another \u00a31.2m in shares and a \u00a360,000 salary increase. In total he trousered \u00a31.71m in 2011. Enough for another barney over pay this year? Best not to leave that one to chance. The 2011 annual report slipped out another gem and Topping's 2012 salary was up again. This year there's an extra \u00a350,000 of salary, to \u00a3650,000. Shareholders could, of course, see the funny side. But, in this climate, that's possibly not the way to bet. Problems stack up for Willie Walsh The standard way of approaching announcements by airline executives has always been to assume David Letterman's stance as he welcomed Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins to the 1994 Oscars. \"Pay attention,\" he told the audience. \"I'm sure they're pissed off about something.\" That rule still stands, although we might already have a clue about what's irking Willie Walsh before he strolls on stage on Friday. The boss of International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, will be flying the flag for the group's first-quarter results this week \u2013 only we'll listen as closely to those numbers as we do to a pre-flight safety demonstration if the planned strike at Heathrow has occurred the day before. This would be a particular irritant for the combative Walsh \u2013 on top of the usual gripes about the third runway and Heathrow queues. A strike would encourage more and more passengers to use other hubs, such as Schiphol and Frankfurt, which is especially painful for IAG given its Heathrow dominance. All of which will make Walsh's response compulsive viewing for devotees of the genre. He is, after all, an expert on industrial relations. Tune in for the King's speech It may be the Queen's speech this week, but in the grocery aisles all ears will be pricked for the King's speech. Justin King, J Sainsbury boss who occasionally mislays his sense of self-effacement, will be unveiling the supermarket's full-year results hours before we listen to the Westminster to-do list. The great retailer has a decent story to tell too, with analysts expecting him to have eked out profits of about \u00a3700m on sales of \u00a323bn \u2013 so even concerns about the economic gloom, Sainsbury's capital expenditure programme and the chance of Tesco finally deciding to resume competition are unlikely to knock the chief executive's legendary confidence. Of course, we all know how King was born to lead, not least because he loves telling us so (\"[We] really struggled to cope without clear and inspirational leadership,\" he said last month. \"It took 10 years, four chief executives and my arrival in 2004 ... to really start to turn the business around.\"). While that may be partly true, it ignores the nagging concern that King's Sainsbury's does not make as much money as it should. Last week, rival Morrisons unveiled profits that were \u00a3200m higher than the expectation for Sainsbury's, despite revenues that were \u00a35bn lower. Taste the difference, Justin. Ghost of Goodwin haunts parliament When the Queen knighted Fred Goodwin in 2004, she probably had no idea how much work she was creating. He may now have been stripped of the gong, but Fred the Pleb's memory will be revived this week as Her Majesty reads out what her government plans to get up to, as she delivers the Queen's speech. One of the things expected to be announced is implementation of the bits of the Vickers report on banking that were not part of the financial services bill \u2013 such as the creation of ringfenced banks, which Fred did so much to bring back into vogue. Also tipped for an appearance is legislation that would allow naughty members of the upper house to be expelled. The Goodwin case highlighted an anomaly which means that peers cannot be ejected from the Lords even if they commit a criminal offence. Back in January, we all said good night Sir Fred. But his legacy just keeps on giving."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
