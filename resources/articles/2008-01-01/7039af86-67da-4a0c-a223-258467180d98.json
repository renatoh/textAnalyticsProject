Yesterday, a new accusation was added to Gordon Brown's charge sheet - the redesign of the 50p coin. The problem is that the figure of Britannia, a symbol of Britain for almost 2,000 years, is to be removed from the tails side of the coin. Brown did not come up with the idea but he did approve the redesign when he was chancellor. Cue anger from the Tories, coin experts and historians. William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, said Britannia was an enduring symbol of British pride and history. \"It is all too typical of a government with an inadequate sense of British pride and an ignorance of history to want to do away with such a symbol,\" he said. One historian wondered if the reality television star Jade Goody would replace Britannia, while a Sunday tabloid urged readers to fill in a coupon declaring their support for the figure. The 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p and 20p coins are also being redesigned. Hundreds of people have entered a competition run by the Royal Mint to redesign the tails sides with a prize of up to \u00a330,000 for the winner. A spokesman for the Treasury confirmed that Brown approved the change but insisted the new design would be \"appropriate\". He said he thought Britannia would almost certainly return in the future. The Royal Mint said it would unveil the new designs in the spring - and promised that Jade Goody will not be appearing on the back of the 50p piece."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
