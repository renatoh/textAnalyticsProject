The picture of leftwinger Mick Rix, which appears to have been used for target practice, was discovered in the office of suspended Blairite general secretary Shaun Brady. Even seasoned officials of the 124-year-old organisation were left dumbfounded. Britain's most powerful industrial union, still reeling from a barbecue brawl three weeks ago that saw Mr Brady and five others suspended, is to hand the cardboard target to a QC hired to investigate the running of the faction-torn union. Mr Rix, beaten in an election last year by Mr Brady, yesterday visited a London police station to ask for advice after his family expressed concern about his safety. With a TUC inquiry completed into the barbecue battle - when political infighting exploded into fist fighting - Aslef's left-led executive also decided to investigate the use of union credit cards by Mr Brady and his suspended ally Michael Blackburn. Over a five-month period Mr Brady spent in excess of \u00a320,000, including two bills at London's Gaucho Grill of more than \u00a3730 each, and Mr Blackburn, the assistant general secretary, spent more than \u00a36,000. Both men strenuously denied any impropriety and insisted all expenditure was on legitimate union business and could be justified. The TUC report into the barbecue brawl was handed to the union yesterday. The panel appointed to discover what happened unearthed conflicting eyewitness accounts. The target of Mr Rix, a file picture of the former general secretary glued to brown cardboard with target circles ringing his head and a hole in his forehead, is headed \"1 round\" with the words \".22 ammunition at 25 yds\" scrawl-ed just below. Mr Rix said: \"I worry about the mental state of the person who did this. Although I may not take the threat seriously, my partner and my family do.\" A spokeman for Mr Brady denied he made the target, saying it had been sent to him anonymously. The credit card investigation follows a scrutiny of trans-actions totalling \u00a320,126.11 for Mr Brady and \u00a36,020.62 for Mr Blackburn between November 2003 and March 2004. Out-of-pocket claims were refunded separately. Mr Brady's Aslef Co-operative Bank visa card was used at the bar of the Three Horseshoes, the union's local in Hampstead, on 30 occasions totalling \u00a3515.77 and he patronised 20 other pubs and bars as well as paying for shopping in Tesco and Sainsbury's. Mr Blackburn used his union card on 16 visits to the Three Horseshoes, costing Aslef \u00a3289.10, plus \u00a36.59 at the Donkey Store, a shop op erated by a charity rescuing distressed animals. Both men strenuously denied any impropriety and said yesterday they could justify all the expenditure which included authorised entertaining of colleagues, Aslef members, others in the rail industry, petrol, accommodation and travel expenses. Mr Brady's bill was said by a spokesperson to include nearly \u00a36,300 to rent an apartment for union business, \u00a33,500 on office furniture and Gaucho Grill dinners attended by members of the executive. He said: \"Every element of expenditure can be demonstrated to be on legitimate Aslef business and I have no problem in advising the executive committee of the details necessary to support this.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
