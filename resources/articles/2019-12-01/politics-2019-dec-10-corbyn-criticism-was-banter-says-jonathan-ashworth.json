Ashworth was caught on tape talking to a Conservative \u201cfriend\u201d and the audio was subsequently leaked to the rightwing Guido Fawkes blog. He has confirmed the veracity of the tape and dismissed it as joking around but it is likely to undermine the leadership\u2019s trust in him as a shadow cabinet minister carrying a crucial brief two days before the election. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire Show, Ashworth said he was \u201csaddened\u201d that a conversation with a friend who he had spent three weeks going round America with had made it into the public domain. On the tape, he says: \u201cI don\u2019t know, on the security stuff; I worked in No 10, I think the machine will pretty quickly move to safeguard security, I mean the civil service machine. But it\u2019s not going to happen! I can\u2019t see it happening.\u201d He said it was \u201cdire for Labour\u201d as a result of a \u201ccombination of Corbyn and Brexit\u201d outside of city seats, and told the friend that he \u201ccan\u2019t see it happening\u201d that Corbyn would be prime minister. Appearing to refer to an unsuccessful plot to oust Corbyn, Ashworth says: \u201cWe fucked it up in 2016 when we went too early. People like me were internally saying: \u2018This isn\u2019t the right moment,\u2019 but I got kind of ignored. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get there; In Mansfield, in Ashfield, it\u2019s dire for the Labour party up there, these traditional working areas.\u201d Pressed then on what would happen to Corbyn if the Tories won the election outright, Ashworth said: \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that\u2019s on our minds \u2026 I think things can change quickly; I think things change more quickly anyway now.\u201d Ashworth told Derbyshire they were \u201chaving banter with each other \u2013 we\u2019re joking around\u201d. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean it because I\u2019m joking around with my mate because he\u2019s a Tory \u2026 If you leak it to Guido Fawkes of course it makes me look like a right plonker but it\u2019s not what I mean when I\u2019m winding up a friend \u2013 I\u2019m trying to sort of pull his leg a bit,\u201d he said. He later apologised to Labour party members telling BBC 2\u2019s Politics Live programme: \u201cObviously with the benefit of hindsight I\u2019ve been too clever by half and I look like an idiot as a result of doing it.But I thought I was having a private conversation with someone who I\u2019ve always had conversations with over the years. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously stupid. I apologise to Labour party members but the reason it has come out today is because the Tories don\u2019t want to be talking about the fact that we\u2019ve had a toddler lying on the floor in a hospital.\u201d The Conservatives seized on the recording after suffering a terrible day of gaffes on Monday, over Johnson\u2019s refusal to look at a picture of a sick boy on a hospital floor and peddling untrue claims that a Tory aide had been hit by a Labour activist. A Conservative spokesman said: \u201cThis is an honest and truly devastating assessment of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership by one of his most trusted election lieutenants. \u201cIf even Corbyn\u2019s closest political allies think he is unfit to be prime minister, why on earth should voters be expected to put their trust in him and them?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
