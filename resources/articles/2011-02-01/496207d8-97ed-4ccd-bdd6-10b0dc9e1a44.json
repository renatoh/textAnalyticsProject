Messages were relayed to No 10 by backbench envoys last week after MPs \u2013 mainly from the right of the party \u2013 concluded that the government did not appear \"competent\" in key departments and was \"out of step\" with grassroots members in several policy areas. Following the latest U-turn, over plans to sell off the nation's forests, Cameron has acted to improve policy co-ordination and presentation by beefing up the Downing Street policy unit, with Andrew Cooper, the co-founder of the polling firm Populus, in the new post of director of political strategy. But Tory MPs, many of whom increasingly resent the influence of Liberal Democrats in ministerial jobs they had sought themselves, want Cameron to go further and remove those they see as incompetent or too far to the left. Some would like to see the prime minister assert his authority by dismissing the environment secretary, Caroline Spelman, who had to admit in the Commons that she had got the policy on forests wrong. Other targets include Kenneth Clarke, the justice secretary, whose liberal approach to sentencing angers the right, and Francis Maude, the cabinet office minister, who is struggling to sell Cameron's \"big society\" idea to the public. Michael Howard was being suggested as a replacement for Clarke. One senior backbencher said: \"The message is getting through that we think there should be change in the summer.\" There is also dismay across the party at the failure to explain adequately the biggest shakeup of the NHS since its formation in 1948. Cameron's supporters say he is unlikely to carry out any reshuffle in the near future unless forced to do so, and emphasise that he will not be influenced by \"noises off\" from the right. \"He will not want to do anything that distracts from the need to get the deficit sorted,\" said one minister. \"And for that we need to stick together, not listen to the right.\" But the signs of restiveness will worry the whips, who fear that the right will turn up the pressure if Nick Clegg wins a referendum on electoral reform. Ministers intend to put more flesh on the bones of the \"big society\" with a white paper on public service reform. It is expected to spell out how charities can help deliver public services and how the private sector can widen its role through payment by results. The Labour party leader, Ed Miliband, sought to exploit the government's difficulties, saying that its shakeup of the NHS was \"putting ideology before people\". The public anger that forced Cameron to ditch the forestry sell-off would be \"as nothing\", he said, to the fury resulting from changes to the NHS that had not been spelled out before the election. He accused ministers of pushing through ideologically driven policies without consultation. \"David Cameron might think he is building the big society \u2013 but it's not in support of his policies, but against them,\" Miliband said in a speech to Labour's Welsh conference in Llandudno. \"Forests are just one example of what happens when a government and a prime minister that don't understand what matters to people don't listen to them, and so carelessly destroy the institutions that people value.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
