Billy Evans, of Field Farm fisheries, said he erected the sign after he was told \u201cthere\u2019s Poles or somebody stealing fish\u201d, but subsequently took it down after alleged threats to his family. \u201cThe sign has been removed because of threats to my family,\u201d Evans told the BBC. \u201cI am not in the country. I will decide what to do on my return. I may close it to all public long-term.\u201d The Guardian reported last week that Evans could face legal action over the sign. A Polish fisherman, Rado Papiewski, had set up a crowdfunding page for a lawsuit, which has raised more than \u00a310,000. On his funding page, Papiewski welcomed Evans\u2019 comments on Sunday. \u201cThis is obviously a big step in the right direction and we are now seeking written confirmation that they have changed their policy and that all anglers are welcome on the site, regardless of their race or nationality,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy legal team are taking this forward and I will provide a further update early in the new year.\u201d Evans said the fishery, in Launton, near Bicester, Oxfordshire, was closed for the winter and would remain so until further notice. \u201cI do not tolerate thieves, wherever they come from,\u201d he said. \u201cI will stand up for what I believe in. If they want to call me a racist for stopping thieves coming on to my property then that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do.\u201d The Equality and Human Rights Commission had said the sign was unlawful and it would take \u201cenforcement action\u201d if necessary. It said it had written to the fishery to advise it to take it down. \u201cIt\u2019s right to challenge such out-of-date practices and any business that believes this is acceptable should think again before they find themselves facing legal action,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the EHRC. Papiewski, 35, from Doncaster, said his fellow anglers had told him about the notice. In full it reads: \u201cNo vehicle access. No Polish or eastern bloc fishermen allowed. No children or dogs.\u201d He said: \u201cWhen I first saw it I thought of my 10-year-old son who loves angling. How could I say to him you can\u2019t fish here because your dad was born in Poland? \u201cThis disturbing sign should have never been displayed as it clearly discriminates against people from Poland and other eastern European countries. It made many fellow law-abiding migrant anglers and me very upset and angry.\u201d Papiewski runs Building Bridges, a project aimed at integrating fishing communities from mainland Europe \u2013 much of which allows anglers to keep their catch \u2013 with anglers in the UK, where fish must be returned to the water. He helps educate non-British anglers about the difference between the laws governing angling in mainland Europe and those in the UK, in an effort to ensure they abide by British rules. The purpose of British laws requiring anglers to return their catch is to improve conservation and prevent the depletion of fish stocks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
