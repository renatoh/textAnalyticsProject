About 100 firefighters and 15 fire engines were dispatched to deal with the blaze on De Pass Gardens that tore through wooden balconies forcing it and neighbouring flats to be evacuated. Peter Mason, chair of the Barking Reach residents\u2019 association, told the Guardian that in early May he contacted the builder Bellway Homes to ask for the fire risk to be investigated after BBC Watchdog broadcast claims of fire safety problems at two other developments by the same builder. In an email seen by the Guardian from the firm\u2019s fire safety helpline last month, Bellway told him not to worry. In a section headed Your Home it said the construction method used on the development in Scotland examined by Watchdog was different and so the Barking homes were not affected in the same way. It concluded: \u201cWe understand that these news articles are highly alarming for all residents of new homes and I hope that the above statement has allayed any fears you may have over the safety and construction of your Bellway home.\u201d Mason said he felt \u201cgut-wrenched\u201d by the fire, adding that people had lost their homes and possessions and were in severe distress. The fire appeared to rip through the wooden cladding around the balconies of the building and may have been caused by a barbecue being lit on one of the balconies, Mason said. Twenty flats were destroyed by the flames and a further 10 were damaged by heat and smoke. One man and one woman were treated at the scene after suffering from smoke inhalation. No other injuries were reported. A London ambulance service spokesperson said: \u201cWe were called at 3.32pm today to a fire in De Pass Gardens, in Barking. \u201cWe sent two ambulance crews, two solo responders and our hazardous area response team. We have a tactical commander and our command support vehicle at the scene. We also dispatched London\u2019s air ambulance.\u201d Venilia Batista Amorim, who lives opposite the flats told the Guardian: \u201cPeople started running, some said the fire alarm was not working, the sprinklers were not working, residents knocked on neighbours doors to tell them to leave. \u201cIt does not come as a surprise, so many residents are concerned.\u201d The managing agents of the block had already hired a fire warden to carry out patrols because of unspecified concerns about fire safety, Mason said. Residents who have been evacuated were advised to go to Thames View community centre on Bastable Avenue. A spokesperson for Bellway said: \u201cWe are taking the matter very seriously and working with all parties to help in establishing the cause of the fire.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
