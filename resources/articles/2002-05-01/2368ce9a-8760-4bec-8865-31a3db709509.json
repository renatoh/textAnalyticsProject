On the opening day of the new campaign yesterday the Grace Road outfit won by 32 runs. Trevor Ward and Darren Stevens shared a 185-run second-wicket stand in the Foxes' total of 283 for five. Warwickshire's Ian Bell, touted as an England star of the future, scored an impressive 72 as the Bears beat Durham Dynamos by 44 runs at the Riverside. In the Second Division, Surrey made short work of Lancashire at the Oval, Martin Bicknell taking five for 26 as the visitors managed a meagre total of 68. It took the home side only 11.5 overs to reach their victory target for the loss of four wickets. Hampshire recovered from a disastrous opening to seal a 46-run victory over Gloucestershire. From eight for two, the Hawks fought back to 219 for five before dismissing the Gladiators for 173. Derbyshire made a winning start by beating Sussex by six wickets at the County Ground thanks, in large part, to Graeme Welch, who took three for 45."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
