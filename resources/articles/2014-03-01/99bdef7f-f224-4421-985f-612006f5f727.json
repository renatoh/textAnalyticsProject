Billy Davies readily acknowledges that he represents a classic example of the breed. Standing 5ft 5in \u2013 although he maintains he is actually 5ft 6in \u2013 the 49-year-old manager sacked by Nottingham Forest for a second time on Monday has paid the price for failing to control a personality which latterly seemed to have crossed the border into downright paranoia. If the impressive collection of Championship manager of the month awards he accrued during successful stints with Preston North End, Derby County \u2013 whom he led into the Premier League \u2013 and Forest are testimony to a genuine managerial talent, Davies could never quite escape his self-destructive insecurities. \"He's 5ft 5, he's from Glasgow and he owns a Rottweiler called Axel, that's all you need to know\" was the standard response from local reporters covering Preston when the nationals called for information on a head coach then perceived as a rising star. In Lancashire, Davies was noted for installing a film-editing suite in his house, assembling montages of his Preston players' flaws and staying up until the small hours pondering how to rectify them. During his latest stint at the City Ground this interest in video technology took a slightly sinister turn, involving the covert filming of journalists at Forest press conferences. Or at least those he had not already barred. Only the club website and a regional television station seemed safe from Davies' enthusiasm for blanket media bans, as Forest morphed into \"the Midlands' answer to North Korea\". If a run of eight games without a win, culminating in Saturday's 5-0 defeat at Derby, finally prompted Fawaz Al-Hasawi to dismiss Davies while preparing to find another manager to re-ignite Forest's play off ambitions, trouble had been brewing for some time. Long-serving club staff were sacked without explanation, while Jim Price, Davies' cousin and agent, joined Forest in a senior role. After being suspended as a solicitor, Price was barred from taking up an official role as a director because he would not have passed the Football League's fit and proper person test. Davies became embroiled in ludicrous rows with photographers during games at Millwall, Brighton and Barnsley. But Al-Hasawi's patience really started wearing thin when the Kuwaiti owner became engaged in a disagreement over transfer market policy with a manager who had spent \u00a39m since his return in February 2013. If a five-game touchline ban imposed for using abusive language to a match official after a 2-2 draw at home to Leicester in February \u2013 (although Davies denied making physical contact with Anthony Taylor, the referee, in the tunnel but lost his appeal against the last three fixtures of that suspension heard by the FA ) \u2013 hardly helped his cause, a recent refusal to talk to the media for \"legal reasons\" finally appeared to raise red flags in the boardroom. Davies' obsession with conspiracy theories and old grudges was starting to grate \u2013 possibly even among a group of players containing several huge admirers of a Glaswegian who will begin life at any new club watching from the stands while he serves the final three games of his touchline exclusion order. Despite being hampered by a series of injuries to key personnel, including the at times brilliant Andy Reid, there was a sense that Forest were starting to surrender too easily while acquiring far too many unnecessary enemies. The tunnel altercation with Taylor precipitated Davies' second banishment from the dugout this season following a brush with Craig Pawson, another referee, in August. Negotiations with Neil Warnock \u2013 who would have seemed like football's answer to Kofi Annan compared with Davies \u2013 hit a glitch last night, with Gary Brazil, the academy manager, in temporary charge for Tuesdaynight's match against Charlton. To Davies' advocates this misrepresents a smart manager capable of real cleverness and, at least before he fell increasingly under Price's spell, genuine charm and smart humour. In January, when many still believed he would return Forest to the Premier League, Reid was at pains to praise his manager. \"Billy Davies is absolutely fantastic,\" said the Irish midfielder. \"His tactics are second to none. We go into matches knowing exactly what we're up against and how we're going to beat it.\" Two months is a long time in football. As he approaches 50, Davies has a shattered reputation to rebuild. The road to redemption could be slow and winding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
