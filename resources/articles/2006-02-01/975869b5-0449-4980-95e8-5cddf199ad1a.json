I entered all the reference numbers without trouble, but the site refused my bank card for no reason. To use another card I had to start from scratch. But I could not do so for four hours. Much later that day, I managed to get my car retaxed, but only after keying in my details three more times. I spent much more time online than it would have taken to walk to a post office and queue, so I shall not make this mistake again. If this is counted as a success story, one can understand why so many e-government systems are a waste of money. Clive Page University of Leicester. \u00b7 There is another reason for not using the online system. There is a charge of \u00a32.50 for paying by credit card, in effect additional tax. This will stop me using the site. It is things like this that make me question the commitment and the professionalism of the people implementing the systems. I have had similar frustrations with pension application forms. If the powers that be cannot get something as simple as this correct and user-friendly, I, for one, will do all in my power to avoid using online government systems for as long as possible. Alan Chapman Macclesfield \u00b7 Twelve months ago I got the car taxed in three minutes, using a telephone. John Dekker Twickenham \u00b7 I used the online system to tax two cars last week and found it to be very quick and easy - maybe five minutes overall. If, as you say, a million people have already used the new service then there would seem to be plenty of people like me who see an advantage in it. Roger Cooper Woodbridge Just the fax, ma'am Mat Smith was of course having a bit of fun in his article (Technobile, February 2). I occasionally use faxes, and the Windows XP fax program, which sends and receives, suits my needs perfectly. No paper jam, no cartridge, no printing (unless you want to). Delete when read. Ecologically pure! Sydney Gibson Walmer \u00b7 It's 3am. Suddenly the little beige fax machine springs into life. A few seconds later, out comes a hand-drawn plan from our man in Australia. Five hours later, I walk in the office, pick it up and read it in seconds. I do a couple of quick sketches, drop them and the 20 pages of timesheets I got this morning into the feed tray, punch in the number and nip off to make a cuppa. I do have an easy life, and a green one, too. My fax uses 5W; Mat Smith's computer, printer and scanner uses 200W. Ken Gilmour Long Easton Beta than the alternative \u2265Software development (\"Are you a dummy for beta software?\", February 2) is indeed becoming more organic, without our realising it (or maybe it has been all along, but we've fought its natural state for business reasons - after all, selling upgrades is a lucrative business). Sure, you still have holdouts and beta logos all over the place, but the reality is this: software is a process. It's never really done. The longer we go on pretending that the vaunted one-dot-oh somehow indicates a sense of finality, security or stability, the harder time we're going to have convincing folks not in the geek world that there will always be bugs, that there are no right answers, and that, just like natural systems, we have to design for imperfection, frailty, accidents and irrational humans. http://factoryjoe.com/blog The beauty of Bleep \u2265Bleep is a service I've admired in principle for ages: you pays your money, and you gets reasonable bitrate MP3s with no DRM. Until yesterday, though, I thought they dealt exclusively in \"electronic listening music\" as we used to call it at university. They appear to have extended their remit a little (At any rate, it's a bit of a rip-off, February 2). Some \u00a36.99 and 10 minutes later, I had clean MP3s of the Arctic Monkeys album and I expect I'll use Bleep again. www.hartnup.net/wordpress \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
