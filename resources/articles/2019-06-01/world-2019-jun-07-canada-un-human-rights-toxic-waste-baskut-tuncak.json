Baskut Tuncak, the special rapporteur on toxic chemicals, called on Canada to improve its monitoring of hazardous materials in the country \u2013 and to better engage with the Indigenous people who live near harmful pollution. Tuncak spent two weeks touring areas of concern across the country, including the county\u2019s infamous tar sands and the Indigenous community of Grassy Narrows, which has fought for more than five decades to have toxic mercury removed from its waters. He released his preliminary findings on Thursday in Ottawa. Despite the vast geographic scope of his mission, a common element in many of the most troubling areas of contamination was their proximity to Indigenous communities. Numerous communities were unable access to clean drinking water, while others had elevated levels of toxins in the water and soil. At the Aamjiwnaang First Nation in Ontario, Tuncak found the community surrounded by chemical facilities. He told the Guardian: \u201cI was struck by the incredible proximity of the affected First Nation to dozens of intense chemical production and processing facilities, which resulted in incredible releases of pollution and waste affecting the [residents\u2019] health.\u201d While the Canadian government has made attempts at reconciliation, the efforts still fall short of respecting basic human rights, he said, and fail to honour the numerous international treaties to which Canada is a signatory. \u201cThe government has taken steps to acknowledge the so-called \u2018sins of the past\u2019 and to increase engagement with Indigenous peoples,\u201d said Tuncak. \u201cBut I also heard deeply troubling examples where the economic interests continue to have supremacy over Indigenous rights.\u201d While much of his focus remained on the impact toxic emissions have on marginalized communities, Tuncak also rejected arguments made by the province of Alberta that its oil is among the world\u2019s most environmentally friendly and ethical. \u201cBased on what I saw first hand, the government can\u2019t make the assertions that the tar sands are environmentally sound and that they\u2019re an ethical source of petroleum products and energy.\u201d He points to lack of data over contamination of water supplies. He also took aim at Canadian companies operating abroad, a number of which have been accused of turning a blind eye to human rights abuses. \u201cThe environmental footprint of these companies and the devastation that has been brought on water resources and the attachments these communities have to the lands on which Canadian businesses are operating needs further attention.\u201d Despite witnessing a handful of bright spots on his trip, including Ontario\u2019s closure of its coal plants and Quebec\u2019s limits on asbestos, he said a greater effort is neededto address the damaging impacts of toxic waste on vulnerable groups. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of political will. Canada has the financial ability and the technical capacity to do things better. It still lags behind many of its peers in terms of industrialized countries,\u201d said Tuncak. \u201cWhen it comes to environmental performance, its record on compliance leaves a lot of room for improvement.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
