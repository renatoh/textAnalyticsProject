All the settings were almost certainly composed during his years in Venice, though not necessarily just for performance in St Mark's. The Sixteen's first instalment of what will be a full survey of the collection concentrates on the second part of the book, though a couple of the spiritual madrigals from the first part are included too and, in fact, the longest work on the disc, a superbly varied seven-part Gloria accompanied by two violins as well as continuo, also comes from the first part, and was probably composed for a special Christmas or Easter mass. By contrast, that second part is almost exclusively devoted to music for the evening service of Vespers, crowned by the sumptuous eight-part setting of Dixit Dominus with which the disc ends. There's a nice immediacy to the choral sound here, without too much churchy resonance obscuring the clarity of the diction and articulation of the Sixteen's performances, one to a part up to a maximum of eight singers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
