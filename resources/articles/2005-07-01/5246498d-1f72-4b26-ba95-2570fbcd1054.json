The capital returned to work today amid unconfirmed reports that the possibility of further attacks has put Britain on its highest ever state of terrorist alert. Mr Blair said an investigation - \"among the most vigorous and intensive this country has seen\" - was under way to find those responsible. Speaking outside King's Cross station, where one of the bombs exploded, Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police chief, said the attack was one of the biggest crimes in English history and said the investigation would take time. The prime minister said it was \"probable that the attack was carried out by Islamist extremist terrorists\" but insisted anger should not be directed at Muslim communities in Britain. He told British Muslims: \"We were proud of your contribution before Thursday, we are proud of it today. \"We are united in our determination that our country will not be defeated by such terror, but will defeat it and emerge from this horror with our values, our way of life, our tolerance and respect for others undiminished.\" The death toll today rose to 52 but could increase further as it was revealed police liasion officers are now working with 74 families. The first two victims of the bomb attack were today named: Susan Levy of Cuffley, Hetfordshire, and Gladys Wundowa of Chadwell Heath, Essex. Mr Blair said intelligence services and police had worked hard over the last few years to guard Britain against such an attack. \"By their very nature, people callous enough to kill completely innocent civilians in this way are hard to stop,\" the prime minister, who has resisted Tory calls for an inquiry, told MPs. \"But our services and police do a heroic job for our country day in day out and I can say that over the past years, as this particular type of new and awful terrorist threat has grown, they have done their utmost to keep this country and its people safe.\" The US president, George Bush, speaking at the same time in West Virginia, vowed to \"take the fight\" to the terrorists behind the London bomb attacks. \"These kind of people who blow up subways and buses are not people you can negotiate with or reason with or appease. In the face of such adversaries there is only one course of action. \"We will continue to take this fight to the enemy and we will fight until this enemy is defeated.\" Intelligence officials have privately conceded that they received little information in the crucial 48 hours following the bombings. A meeting on Saturday between top British, US and European intelligence chiefs admitted that there had been few breaks, few leads and no suspects, today's New York Times reported. Christophe Chaboud, a French anti-terrorist official present at the meeting, told today's Le Monde the apparent use of military explosives was \"very worrying\". \"We're more used to cells making homemade explosives with chemicals. How did they get them? Either by trafficking, for example, in the Balkans, or they had someone on the inside who enabled them to get them out of a military establishment,\" he said. Police would not rule out the possibility of further attacks and the investigation is still waiting for the breakthrough that will help police track down the bombers. Detectives have appealed to the public to email any photographs, video footage or mobile phone images taken after the bombings to Scotland Yard at images@met.police.uk. James Hart, Commissioner of City of London police, said: \"We can't possibly assume that what happened on Thursday was the last of these events. There is absolutely no doubt that there are people out there who wish us harm and we have to be vigilant.\" In a sign of the heightened security presence, parts of Westminster were closed for 30 minutes today after police discovered a suspicious package in Whitehall. Downing Street, Whitehall and Parliament Square were closed and two buses were evacuated before police gave the all clear. The prime minister said July 7 would always \"be remembered as a day of sadness for our country\" but told the the Commons that the stoicism and resilience Londoners had responded to the attacks with was \"universally admired\". \"Four days later its people are coming to work with a steely determination,\" he told MPs, adding that while London was hardly recognisable as the city that bore the Blitz the same values ran through the people. \"Britain may be different but the confidence and the character are the same,\" he told MPs. Tube passenger numbers and road traffic in the city centre were back to normal after the subdued conditions of Thursday and Friday, but there is a continued freeze on Circle line and most Piccadilly line services. All visible bodies have now been removed from the four bomb sites, while emergency services continued to search underneath a train in the Piccadilly line tunnels. Some 62 victims of the attacks were today still being treated in hospital. The mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, was among those using the tube to get to work at City Hall this morning. As he boarded a packed service from Willesden Green station to London Bridge, he said: \"We are going to work. We carry on our lives. We don't let a small group of terrorists change the way we live.\" Mr Livingstone has announced a two-minute silence this Thursday to commemorate the bombings, during which bus drivers throughout the city will stop their vehicles and turn off their engines. The tube will remain in operation, with passengers informed of the silence through public address systems. At King's Cross station this morning many commuters travelled early to avoid overcrowding. There was a definite feeling of unease and disquiet among those passing one of Thursday's biggest disaster sites. Janice Rose, 55, from Ealing, said she felt \"awful\" as her day began. \"I feel terrible,\" she told the Press Association. \"I left my house at 5.45am this morning to get to Islington and it is past 7am and I am still travelling. \"I think I am still traumatised by Thursday and whoever I see around me on the train or the bus, I see as a suspect. I am really put off by the whole experience.\" Retailers estimated that they have lost \u00a326m worth of sales since the attacks, with a 77% drop in customers last Thursday and shopping volumes only just returning to normal. The crisis committee of the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council said around 588,000 visitors may decide not to come to the UK because of the bomb blasts, representing a decline of only 1.9% on the total number of people previously expected to visit the country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
