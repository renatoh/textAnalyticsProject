Last time Richard gave us a glimpse into his thinking on the region's complexities was on the eve of the Palestinian elections, in a broadcast that caused us to wonder whether we'd missed some kind of meeting. \"I'm Richard Gere,\" he began, \"and I'm speaking for the entire world.\" Richard now intervenes from Petra, Jordan, where he is attending a conference which aims to develop solutions to the world's problems. To repeat: the star of Runaway Bride is developing solutions to the world's problems. \"Interconnectiveness is the key,\" he explains to reporters. \"The irony is everyone on both sides and the governments know each other very well. They can talk to each other if they can just drop the stuff, literally dropping where they're coming from and the agendas.\" Mm. Encouragingly, the conference is billed as \"a gathering of the world's top thinkers\". \u00b7 Correction of the week comes from the Orlando Sentinel. \"The Fred Basset comic strip on page E8 of Tuesday's Life and Times section may have created the impression that it is safe for dogs to eat chocolate,\" it reads. \"That is not the case.\" All pretty glib to anyone who recalls the calamitous effect of Garfield's coffee addiction on the North American feline population, but to underscore the point perhaps a liver failure plotline could be storyboarded for Fred at once. \u00b7 Destiny speaks. On the very day we announce plans to offer our old friend Helen Clark guest editorship of the column she so often enlivened, the former Peterborough MP surfaces in the Telegraph. And the big news is that Helen appears to be having one of her Virginia Woolf episodes. \"Days are made up of complicated hours, minutes, seconds and silence,\" she writes. \"I sit reading a paper in a local hotel. A couple I have helped ignore me. I leave without comment. I walk down the street outside my office ... A group of yobs surround me. They yell 'loser, loser' and spit in my face ...\" Golly. We'd assumed her ill luck was confined to the railways. But whilst there are moments of bewildering opacity - \"I can't escape the usual sneering in certain newspaper diaries\" - it is clear that a media career is the goal. Formal approaches have been made, and we can only wait. \u00b7 Next, they said it couldn't be done, but enterprising Americans have somehow contrived to make the fish symbols beloved of Christian motorists even more irksome. Traditionally, the fish commemorate Jesus's famous dictum \"I will make you fishers of Mondeos\" - but just look at the contemporary reworking below. \"Do you believe God belongs in government?\" demands the Bush Fish sales blurb. \"Do you believe George Bush is doing the Lord's work? Then show your love!\" A Bush Fish costs $3.25, but the prudent may wish to lay out a little extra on motor insurance. \u00b7 A baffling press release arrives from Z'est PR. \"Nigel Kennedy has been devastated by the loss of his three most treasured violins,\" Henrietta Mackenzie sensationally reveals. \"As a result he will be forced to play London's Ronnie Scotts on [dates redacted] without these trademark violins.\" We called the second we heard, we tell Henrietta. Thank God he managed to force himself off the window ledge to provide a quote on the matter. It seems somehow wrong to try and put our finger on any silver lining to the tragedy, but with the proverbial gun to the head, at least you managed to get the tour dates out there? A pause. \"Erm ... yes,\" replies Henrietta, who's clearly still very shaken."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
