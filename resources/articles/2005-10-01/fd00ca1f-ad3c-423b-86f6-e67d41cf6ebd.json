The 175-year-old suspension footbridge, wide enough only for a single walker, swayed alarmingly as we strode across, with the river roaring 40ft below. We headed upstream, where the river is shallow and shrubby cinquefoil was still in flower. This Potentilla species is common in gardens but Upper Teesdale is one of only a handful of locations in England where the wild plants flower, and can be admired in their natural habitat. Further upstream we reached two more highlights. First, bog asphodel, whose yellow starry flowers had faded giving way to vivid orange seed capsules. And then we reached the juniper forest. Few of the ancient, gnarled trees, whose foliage and berries emit an intoxicating aroma of gin when crushed, are much more than 15ft tall. Following the winding path through this miniature forest, where people become giants and where a distant rumble grows louder, is the perfect prelude to what lurks just around the corner. Emerging from the trees, we stood on the rocky promontory and gazed down on High Force, where the River Tees crashes down 80ft into a cauldron of spray and whitewater; landscape theatre at its best."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
