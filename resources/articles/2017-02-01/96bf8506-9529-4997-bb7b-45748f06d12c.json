The former prime minister will make the statement at his first big speech since the EU referendum, arguing that people were misinformed when they voted for Brexit. \u201cThe people voted without knowledge of the true terms of Brexit. As these terms become clear, it is their right to change their mind,\u201d he is expected to say. \u201cOur mission is to persuade them to do so.\u201d His intervention is likely to be highly controversial at a time when Theresa May has criticised those seeking to deny the \u201cwill of the people\u201d as reflected by the EU referendum vote on 23 June 2016, and when Labour\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has pledged not to block the triggering of Brexit. Blair gave an interview saying Brexit could be halted if the British people decided the costs of leaving the EU greatly outweighed any benefits, as he signalled a return to political activity last November. But in his speech hosted by Open Britain, the successor to the remain campaign, he will go further in issuing a rallying call, to those who want to remain in the EU, to fight against Brexit. \u201cOur challenge is to expose relentlessly the actual cost, to show how this decision was based on imperfect knowledge which will now become informed knowledge, to calculate in \u2018easy to understand\u2019 ways how proceeding will cause real damage to the country and its citizens, and to build support for finding a way out from the present rush over the cliff\u2019s edge,\u201d the former Labour leader said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can succeed. But I do know we will suffer a rancorous verdict from future generations if we do not try. This is not the time for retreat, indifference or despair, but the time to rise up in defence of what we believe.\u201d Blair will say that the British people voted to leave Europe and the will of the people should prevail, but that public opinion might not always be pro-Brexit as the terms of leaving became clear. He will also suggest May and her pro-Brexit colleagues have been abusing the \u201cmantle of patriotism\u201d to make their case for proceeding with an exit from the EU. \u201cWe do not argue for Britain in Europe because we are citizens of nowhere,\u201d he will say. \u201cWe argue for it precisely because we are proud citizens of our country who believe that in the 21st century we should maintain our partnership with the biggest political union and largest commercial market right on our doorstep; not in diminution of our national interest, but in satisfaction of it.\u201d Despite having previously described the Conservative prime minister as \u201ca very solid, sensible person\u201d he will be strongly critical of her government\u2019s approach to Brexit as members prepare to trigger article 50 by the end of March, notifying the EU of the UK\u2019s intention to leave. \u201cThis is a government for Brexit, of Brexit and dominated by Brexit. It is a mono-purpose political entity,\u201d he will say. \u201cThose driving this always wanted a hard Brexit. Indeed even the term \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 requires amendment. The policy is now Brexit at any cost.\u201d May, who has come under pressure to guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in the UK, stressed on Thursday that Britain will remain an \u201copen and tolerant\u201d country and that French people will \u201calways be welcome\u201d, ahead of talks with French prime minister Bernard Cazeneuve. She wrote in Le Figaro newspaper that the UK would not try to \u201ccherry-pick\u201d elements of EU membership, but would be leaving altogether. Blair\u2019s intervention will be particularly inflammatory as many of his critics have accused him of presiding over a wave of immigration from eastern European countries without being straight with the electorate about its likely magnitude. He will directly address the issue of immigration in his speech, arguing that leaving the EU will only reduce the number of new arrivals to the UK by a fraction. He will say: \u201cThere is, in some parts of the country, a genuine concern about numbers from Europe \u2013 real pressures on services and wages. But for many people, the core of the immigration question \u2013 and one which I fully accept is a substantial issue \u2013 is immigration from non-European countries especially when from different cultures in which assimilation and potential security threats can be an issue. \u201cNonetheless, we have moved in a few months from a debate about what sort of Brexit, involving a balanced consideration of all the different possibilities, to the primacy of one consideration \u2013 namely controlling immigration from the EU \u2013 without any real discussion as to why and when Brexit doesn\u2019t affect the immigration people most care about.\u201d He will also highlight the risks of the possible breakup of the UK and a destabilising impact on the Northern Ireland peace process. Blair\u2019s position contrasts sharply with that of Corbyn, who took the decision to whip his MPs to vote in favour of May\u2019s Brexit bill last week. Four shadow cabinet ministers resigned so they could be among the 47 Labour MPs to vote against Brexit. Corbyn has made clear Labour will not block Brexit, although the party is likely to renew its attempt to secure amendments to the bill when it passes through the Lords, starting on Monday. Open Britain has emerged as a cross-party political force since the referendum, with the purpose of campaigning against a \u201chard, destructive Brexit\u201d. Its key supporters in parliament include the Tory MPs Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve, the Labour MPs Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie, and the former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
