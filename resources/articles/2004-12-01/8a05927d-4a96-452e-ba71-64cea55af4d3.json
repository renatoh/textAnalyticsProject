The Tigers are now nine points ahead of Wasps at the top of the Premiership, a half-century of points giving them their biggest victory of the season. Worcester were on the ropes at the end of the first half when they conceded three tries in five minutes. The Warriors drop to bottom place and, on this evidence, face a struggle to survive. \"I'm delighted to have scored 50 against a side who have given a lot of teams problems,\" said Leicester's coach John Wells. \"They came here with a good set of forwards and we knew we had to take them on in the scrum and deprive Craig Gillies of the ball in the lineouts and that's just what we did. We now have a bit of a buffer at the top which we'll need in the second half of the season.\" The afternoon was not without problems for Wells, who saw his Fijian wing Seru Rabeni depart with a recurrence of his knee injury after 13 minutes. Graham Rowntree followed him to the dressing room shortly afterwards with a back problem and Lewis Moody was not on the bench after aggravating his hand injury opening Christmas presents. Andy Robinson will be relieved Moody's birthday is not until June. The day was gift-wrapped for Leicester, though. They took time to shift through their gears, with Neil Back eventually scoring after 15 minutes from a drive from a lineout. Worcester were then left in their slipstream. Rob Debney awarded a penalty try after the visiting pack brought down a driving maul. Geordan Murphy then intercepted a pass on his own 10-metre line for Back to set up a counter-attacking try for Daryl Gibson and Andy Goode darted over in the corner. The Tigers could afford to cruise after the break, with Murphy scoring a cracking individual try. Harry Ellis and Dan Hipkiss twisted the knife with further scores. Worcester's try came from their centre Gary Trueman but like the referee Wayne Barnes, who missed the game having been stuck in traffic on the M6, they were left trailing as the Leicester juggernaut rolled on.
