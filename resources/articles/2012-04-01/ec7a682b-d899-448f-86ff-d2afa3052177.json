In a highly exciting twist, the resulting experiment has made it to TV\u2026 as an advert! Jojola is tasked with taking the perfect shot of a Gaga-a-like model dressed in feathers and glitter while both are skydiving at 126mph. Jojola drifts through an ombr\u00e9 sky to the pulsing beat of Chromatics' Tick Of The Clock (from the Drive soundtrack, naturally), accompanied by two men sporting oversized headlamps. Physics may seem to dictate that a photo taken while hurtling downwards will be messy, yet this youthful answer to Juergen Teller captures images with ease. He even has time to scroll around a bit before uploading a photo to an unknown location (presumably a blog where he also ironically praises Gossip Girl). As this indie ingenue hits the ground, his face radiates the brand of banal relief usually reserved for someone who has rifled through a supermarket bin in search of discount satsumas and come up with a handful that are barely bruised. HTC has tried a bit too hard to nail a countercultural vibe, but perhaps that's the point. While Apple might be able to flog a phone with one-size-fits-all minimalism, its rival's arthouse gimmickry is unique, and sure to catch the attentions of millions who share a love for Instagram, vintage shopping and awkwardly dismissing the predictable nature of society.
