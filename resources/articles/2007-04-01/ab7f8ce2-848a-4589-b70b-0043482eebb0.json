Faced with an almost universally hostile response from Italy's centre-left government, AT&amp;T said it was pulling out of talks aimed at securing a one-third stake in Olimpia, the holding company that in effect controls Telecom Italia. Mexico's Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, which is also seeking a third, said it would continue to mull \"different alternatives for a potential investment in Olimpia\". The seller, Italian conglomerate Pirelli, said AT&amp;T had withdrawn because of \"possible regulatory difficulties\". That could mean that the government, which still has a \"golden share\" in the privatised Telecom Italia, insisted the fixed-line network be hived off and possibly returned to state control. At the origin of the outcry was Telecom Italia's peculiar ownership structure, which gives Olimpia a decisive hold over the company with only 18% of the equity. The \"Tex-Mex alliance\", as it was dubbed in the Italian media, could therefore have won control of a \u20ac44bn (\u00a330bn) group with an outlay of about \u20ac4.5bn. The prime minister, Romano Prodi, said at the weekend the government would be happy if Italian investors stepped in. And yesterday the chief executive of the Intesa San Paolo bank, Corrado Passera, signalled he was interested in taking a stake. The tensions surrounding Telecom Italia are immense. It is at the centre of an investigation into alleged bugging by in-house security experts. And, since being privatised, its share price has crumbled. Some of those pent-up feelings burst into the open at a shareholders' meeting in Milan yesterday as a satirist ranted at the board while riot police held back trade union protesters outside. The comedian, Beppe Grillo, who claimed to represent 4,000 small shareholders, said privatisation had \"stripped the company of billions of euros in earnings and tens of thousands of jobs\" while \"ragged-arsed so-called managers\" indebted the company \"for their own interests\". \"The management should have quit after such an embarrassment,\" he said. Pointing to members of the board, he said: \"In the United States, these people would be sentenced to 20 years in jail.\" Grillo, who made early warnings over Parmalat's collapse, said outside that small investors \"don't know what's happened. The only thing for certain is that they invested 10 and now have five.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
