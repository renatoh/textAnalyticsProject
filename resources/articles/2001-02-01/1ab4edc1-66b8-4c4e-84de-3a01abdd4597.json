Nobody who saw Larsson's puny physique, clumsy touch and general slow-wittedness on that first appearance, against Hibs at Easter Road in August, 1997, could possibly have predicted that he would gain unopposed entry to that pantheon of great Celtic strikers of the past 40 years. But whatever apprehension the Rangers defenders selected by Dick Advocaat for this afternoon's visit to Celtic Park may experience on the approach to the potentially decisive SPL match will stem directly from the prospect of a confrontation with Larsson. Aggregate figures of 106 goals from 141 appearances - his latest contribution was the double that helped beat the Ibrox side 3-1 in Wednesday night's CIS Insurance League Cup semi-final at Hampden Park - testify to his deadliness. Advocaat highlighted Larsson's all-embracing abilities last week, when his tribute to a dangerous rival included favourable comparison with Gabriel Batistuta and concluded with the assertion that the Swede is one of the most outstanding front men in the world. 'Batistuta can be out of a game for all but one or two moments of the 90 minutes,' said the Rangers manager. 'During those short interventions, he can kill you with a goal or two. Larsson scores, too, but he is a better player, bringing others into the game and showing abilities that other strikers don't have.' Larsson, naturally guarded when discussing his own gifts or anything to do with his future at Celtic - Martin O'Neill is being urged to secure his signature on an extension even at two-and-a-half years short of the expiry of his current contract - opens like a daffodil in spring when the subject is a team-mate, specifically Chris Sutton. The former Chelsea forward's arrival for 10 times the money Celtic paid for Larsson has brought together a partnership that has terrorised defences. Larsson alone has delivered an astonishing 37 goals, all but six in the league. 'What I've done wouldn't be possible without a partner like Chris,' said Larsson. 'You can't do that by yourself. Chris has been brilliant for Celtic, but, especially, for me. He's a big lad and a great target player. He takes away defenders and leaves me space in which to manoeuvre. He likes to work.' Significantly, Larsson was never heard to utter such praise for former sidekick, Mark Viduka. The lethargic tendency in the big Australian, unquestionably a talented forward, would insult the Swede's obsession with the work ethic. In Sutton, he has found a fellow traveller. Sutton repays the compliment, saying Larsson outshines Alan Shearer, the former England striker he partnered so productively at Blackburn when they won the Premiership in 1995. 'Henrik is the better player,' said Sutton. 'He's up and down the park and can do anything. He scores goals and has the pace to frighten anybody. Alan is a great player, but Henrik is quite simply superb.' Praise indeed. Sutton is just one of seven signings by O'Neill and Larsson is convinced that the new recruits and the Irishman's deep understanding of man management have been the most telling factors in Celtic's total transformation. A team of under-achievers, they tamely allowed Rangers to win last season's title by a record 21 points but now enter today's third Old Firm league meeting of the campaign with a nine-point advantage. 'I think the biggest differences now,' said Larsson, 'are the influence of the new players - they are all strong, focused men - and the manager's ability to restore the self-belief of players who were already here. I think that was a bit low when O'Neill arrived. There's a greater level of concentration now. In the past, it's maybe not been as good.' The esteem in which Larsson is held by Celtic supporters derives not just from his achievements on the field, but from his obvious liking for the club and for Glasgow. The last time there were fears for his future, in 1999, he signed, without messy negotiations, a four-year extension to his agreement. Larsson never gave up on Celtic, even during the darker days of Rangers' ascendancy. 'I liked Celtic and Glasgow right away,' he said, 'and that first impression has remained. It's why I left Feyenoord. First, I wanted to try something else and Scottish football appealed to me. It's a physical and a quick game and that's what you get in international football. 'I don't doubt that playing here has helped me improve and it is certainly very useful to go into international football knowing that you play in the same kind of game every week. More important than anything, my family is happy here. My wife likes it and my son Jordan talks with a Glasgow accent. He doesn't know anything else. He was only two weeks old when we came and now he's three-and-a-half. And I don't mean he has the same kind of Scottish accent as Morten Wieghorst after his years with Dundee and Celtic. This is the real thing.' Larsson's assimilation into the culture of the Scottish game was effected easily, his appreciation of the febrile relationship between the Old Firm clubs and of the hopes and anxieties of Celtic's fans forming almost instantaneously. 'It didn't take long,' he recalled. 'Of course, I knew about Celtic and Rangers and the rest of it became obvious from the start. I remember in my first season, when we won the league, we played a match at Dunfermline in which victory would have brought us the title. 'We were 1-0 ahead until about five minutes from the end and conceded the equaliser. When our bus got back to Celtic Park, there were people out on the street, crying. But Old Firm matches are still, for me, about the football. Nothing else. I'm playing the one game and no other games, religious or political.' In a piece on Larsson during his first season in Glasgow, this column claimed that he had convinced the Celtic support that, at \u00a3600,000 from Feyenoord, he was the buy of the decade. His form and his achievements since then demand modification of that appraisal; Larsson has proved himself the buy of any decade."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
