We had ice-cream vans, Victorian-era public baths, the Top Hat dance hall, a couple of forlorn chippers with Gene Vincent on the jukebox and icons of the Sacred Heart on the wall. Old ladies shuffled the pier, arm in arm, tutting at the greasers and their bell-bottomed girlfriends. It wasn\u2019t the wild Irish coastline of Kerry or Connemara; it was more like Skegness with nuns. You didn\u2019t see the waves roar in from the horizon, those thunderous breakers born off Newfoundland, or feel the shocking tang of spray in your mouth. Some pubs were said to be rough, some backstreets to be avoided. Like all port towns, D\u00fan Laoghaire had a little grit beneath its fingernails. But still, it had magic, too. For decades, the Holyhead ferries came and went. An aroma of the sea drifted on the air, commingling with that Dublin redolence of coal smoke and rain. In the Victorian age, prosperous D\u00fan Laoghaire had been renamed \u201cKingstown\u201d. Something of that crusty elegance could be seen in the sad-eyed old townhouses that once must have been handsome. The post boxes on Marine Road had the royal initials \u201cVR\u201d or \u201cGR\u201d still faintly discernible under their thick layerings of green paint. A cast-iron monument to Queen Victoria stood near the seafront and regularly was vandalised by ardent local republicans or kids with nothing to do. The once wondrous Pavilion cinema, like an art deco ocean liner that had run aground, was falling to pieces around us. James Joyce had spent a few nights in the derelict Martello tower. George Bernard Shaw was born nearby. Oscar Wilde, Samuel Beckett and Bram Stoker had all walked the very pier where we teenagers smoked and kissed and played poker for pennies. That lonely man, the great playwright John Synge, had lived on Adelaide Road with his widowed mother, detesting the daytrippers, the popularity of the town. In one letter to his fiancee, he despairs magnificently of \u201cKingstown, the heat, the frowsy women\u201d. We kids took a certain pleasure in the emptiness of D\u00fan Laoghaire, its jagged, unswimmable inlets, its broken-down boarding houses. When local band the Boomtown Rats began to make it big, their success belonged to us all. Punning on the supposed difficulty of spelling the town\u2019s name, one of their songs included the scalding lyric, \u201cTired and weary / drab and dreary / that is how / to spell / Dun Laoghaire.\u201d And when the Jam came to play the Top Hat in 1978 we rejoiced to see the town\u2019s old days put to death. We didn\u2019t think of unemployment, emigration, poverty. For centuries, the fantasies of outsiders had been projected on to D\u00fan Laoghaire, as we were now projecting our own. The story of the town is incomplete without England. Hundreds of thousands of Irish people had set out from our pier, Joyce, Shaw, Wilde and Stoker among them, as well as many of our own ancestors and aunts and uncles. Yes, immigrants to the new land sometimes met coldness but many met acceptance, an end to their belittlement. The sea divides. It also connects. Much depends on how you regard it. Growing up in a coastal town taught you the complications that get lived between words. The story, in D\u00fan Laoghaire, was not always what it seemed. Absence was a powerful presence. \u2022 Shadowplay by Joseph O\u2019Connor is published by Harvill Secker (RRP \u00a314.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.
