But now Tony Blair has admitted that the soundbite has cramped his style. \"Politics is about communicating things to people, you want to communicate one thing but you lapse into humour or irony. And never try to do irony - I have tried it once or twice and it has never worked,\" Mr Blair admits during an interview with Stephen Fry for a podcast released on the Downing Street website. \"[You] may do 100 different things in a day but the 30 seconds that people see of you on the evening news is what you have done that day so far as they are concerned. \"So if you make a remark that is maybe a bit off-line and that is there, then you might have launched a new education initiative, tackled a particularly knotty crime problem, you know, done whatever you have done for peacemaking or otherwise in the world, but actually that is the 30 seconds that they see.\" On the other hand, Mr Blair says, the 24/7 news media puts an \"enormous stress and strain\" on public debate, prohibiting reasoned policy argument. Mr Blair says he has not kept a diary of his time in Downing Street, but hints that once he leaves he will try to understand the world of the iPod and text messaging which, he acknowledges, is also changing the medium of political debate. Campaigns such as Make Poverty History and Stop Climate Chaos have demonstrated \"a different type of political engagement where you do have to engage with people through issues\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
