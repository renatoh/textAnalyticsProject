Pinault is the sixth-richest man in France and something of a legend, but there are worries that he could come unstuck because of an agreement that was consummated on 10 September 2001, the day before the terrorist attacks on the United States. Pinault had signed a deal with his arch-rival Bernard Arnault, head of French luxury goods group LVMH, which ended a vicious takeover battle for Italy's Gucci, the world-famous fashion house. The outcome of the struggle - dubbed 'the war of the handbags' - appeared to end in favour of Pinault in that Arnault sold him half of LVMH's stake at \u00a357 a share. The arrangement gave Pinault more than 50 per cent of Gucci. There was a sting in the tail, but no one knew it at the time: under a parallel accord, minority shareholders in Gucci can force Pinault, head of Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR), to buy them out at \u00a361.86 a share in March next year. What's wrong with that, you may ask? The problem turns on price. Gucci's shares currently trade at about \u00a356, but would probably be closer to \u00a330 if it were not for the put option, the financial instrument that requires Pinault to buy out the minorities. Here is the arithmetic: the luckless Pinault must pay about \u00a33.04 billion to buy the 40 per cent of Gucci he does not own. But the value of that investment could nearly halve once the deal is done. Under the worse case scenario, Pinault could overpay by \u00a31.21bn. Can he afford to? PPR denies that there are any problems in meeting its obligations, but the group, whose interests span European retailing and distribution, has net debt of \u00a33.59bn, while there are also debts that accrue to PPR's two holding companies - Artemis and Financi\u00e8re Pinault - estimated at \u00a33.3bn. PPR's managing director, Serge Wein berg, insists that the company's strategy is clear enough: to become a retailing and luxury goods firm around the Gucci brand. But the fact remains that PPR has been selling assets like mad to produce enough capital to pay for the rest of Gucci. Pinault himself is rarely out of the public spotlight in France these days. His new strategic direction, established in 1999 when he bought a small shareholding in Gucci and acquired Yves Saint Laurent, is the subject of a hard-hitting book published recently by Fran\u00e7ois Roche, a former editorial director of La Tribune . Roche examines the 'very real threats that the Gucci purchase poses for the survival of the PPR group'. The, The Threatened Empire, is now itself the subject of controversy as journalists at La Tribune, owned by Arnault's LVMH, have protested about the coverage of Pinault. Sources close to PPR have hinted that Arnault is behind the publication. To be fair, not everyone appears as worried about PPR as Roche. For example, Jacques-Franck Dossin, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, says: 'Our view is that PPR has sold enough assets to honour its commitments and let's not forget that even though the company will be buying Gucci shares above their value in the market, there is always a premium for control.' But Roche's book - which is not the first to ask questions about Pinault - looks at the thorny issues surrounding his purchase of US insurance company Executive Life in the early 1990s; the deal is being questioned by the US authorities, and legal action is pending. Californian insurance regulators claim that Pinault knew about a rescue package put together by French bank Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, which was allegedly executed via a deception. The US prosecutor claims that Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais created a fictitious group of shareholders in order to acquire the junk bonds portfolio of Executive Life, before selling the assets to Pinault. The Californian regulator's lawyers contend that Pinault benefited financially from the alleged deception; they are now seeking financial recompense. If the regulator can prove that Pinault acted improperly, it could end up proving expensive for him. It would be doubly unfortunate if any debt became due at around the same time as PPR was required to exercise its option to buy out the remainder of Gucci. For his part, Pinault strenuously denies any wrongdoing, and has dismissed many of the claims as no more than mud-slinging. Pinault has fought hard to build a business that has brought him within the orbit of the French establishment. Born in 1936, the son of a Breton farmer and forester, Pinault started life as a provincial timber merchant. In the early 1990s, his career took off - with backing from Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, then a government-owned bank - when he purchased a state-controlled wood company. Later, he went on to bid for Au Printemps, a department store chain. Although the complex methods that he used to acquire the company sparked controversy - and eventually, changes in French company law - there was never any suggestion of illegality. In the 1970s and 1980s, he bought struggling businesses that might otherwise have gone under. He told the Financial Times: 'I do not have any money. The only way in which I was going to develop was to buy companies that nobody wanted.' Twenty years ago, Pinault probably never dreamed that he would one day own Britain's world-famous auction house, Christie's, which he acquired for more than \u00a3700m in 1998. He also owns Chteau Latour, one of France's great red wines. But what now? Many Paris-based financial analysts are sanguine about PPR's prospects, but there are still obstacles ahead for Pinault. For example, there is the festering problem of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, which was engulfed in a scandal 10 years ago after it was discovered that it had faked its accounts. A handful of former senior bankers are on trial in Paris, among them Jean-Claude Trichet, who has been nominated as the future head of the European Central Bank and will need to be exonerated if he is to take up the position. As for Pinault, he was questioned last year by lawyers, who are bringing a civil case against him and Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais for their role in the Executive Life affair. In Paris, PPR's share price has dived from a high of \u00a3187 to \u00a340. Last month, the company reported a 7 per cent fall in operating profit for 2002; brokers are worried that the group is selling assets at a difficult time, which means that asking prices are depressed. Disposals, of course, are being driven by the need to buy out the rest of Gucci. PPR is not alone in its troubles. Luxury goods groups around the world have seen their shares tumble since 11 September. This is not a sector of the market that is going to take off in the teeth of the worst slowdown for a decade. The long-term implications for Pinault are hard to fathom. But as one analyst noted: 'We will know soon enough.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
