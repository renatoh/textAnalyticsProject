We should point out that Turkey\u2019s president clearly loves a footballer\u2019s wedding. Perhaps it\u2019s the tasty canap\u00e9s on offer or, more likely, the effect such appearances can have on his popularity. Just over a year before he was best man for Mesut \u00d6zil, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan played the same role on Arda Turan\u2019s big day. Erdo\u011fan was also present at Hakan \u015e\u00fck\u00fcr\u2019s wedding in 1995. But on this occasion, as the mayor of Istanbul, he actually conducted the ceremony. Curiously, the best man was Fethullah G\u00fclen, the leader of the G\u00fclen movement, now a vocal critic and enemy of Erdo\u011fan who is exiled in the United States. We haven\u2019t found any other guests with with such political heft playing such a central role, but the Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s third son, Saadi, flew in to shower Jay Bothroyd with confetti when the former Cardiff striker tied the knot. \u201cSaadi is a friend of mine. His dad is obviously a tyrant and he dictated over his countrymen through fear but Saadi was never like that,\u201d said Bothroyd in 2011, who got to know Saadi at Perugia, where the dictator\u2019s son made one appearance in the 2003-04 season before eventually being made commander of special forces in Libya. \u201cHe was always friendly and polite. He even came to my wedding. Obviously he used to have parties and stuff and he would invite me to Cannes to watch the Grand Prix. For his birthday he would fly me over on his plane. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t know him might say he\u2019s like this or like that or like his dad, but I\u2019ve never seen that. I looked at him like a friend. He wasn\u2019t the best [footballer] but he did it as a hobby. He\u2019s a billionaire but it was something he wanted to do. He never expected any special treatment \u2026 People will say to me, \u2018how can you be friends with this guy?\u2019 But you can only judge people on how you see them. He was always nice to me \u2026 It has been weird. He paid for my honeymoon.\u201d And then there\u2019s Sergio Ramos, who married the TV presenter Pilar Rubio recently and reportedly forked out around \u00a3900,000 to fly AC/DC in to play at his reception. They\u2019re perhaps not as unlikely an attendee as, say, Mo Salah would be, but even for a master of the dark arts, having a 1970s hard rock band to entertain guests is an eyebrow-raising choice. Any more for any more? Born close to the scene of trophy-lifting success \u201cWhat is the shortest distance a cup-winning captain has had to travel from his place of birth to where he received the cup?\u201d asks Kevin Gilvary. Let\u2019s start with an 80s FA Cup hero, Dave Beasant. \u201cHe was born in Willesden, which is 3km from Wembley Stadium, where he lifted the FA Cup for Wimbledon in 1988,\u201d writes Wayne Ziants. \u201cIt was widely reported at the time that he could see the twin towers from the house he grew up in.\u201d Dan Fagan takes us all the way to Uruguay for a similarly close example involving the Jules Rimet trophy. \u201cJos\u00e9 Nasazzi, captain of Uruguay in 1930, lifted the World Cup in the Estadio Centenario, just three miles from his place of birth in Bella Vista, Montevideo.\u201d But Dan has found a famous Glaswegian whose birthplace was even closer to the scene of his future success. \u201cKenny Dalglish lifted the Scottish Cup in 1977 two miles from his place of birth, Dalmarnock in Glasgow\u2019s east end.\u201d David v Goliath (2) Last week, we looked into football\u2019s biggest international population discrepancy results. But there\u2019s more to spin off into \u2026 \u201cCura\u00e7ao\u2019s win is impressive, but far from the best,\u201d writes Ravid Alon. \u201cWe need to look into geographical area as well as population. Cura\u00e7ao\u2019s area is only 444km2, which is small enough, but India is \u2018only\u2019 the seventh biggest country in the world, at over 3mkm2, for a ratio of 7,403.7. The obvious candidate for Goliath is USSR, with a whopping 22.4m km2. Unfortunately, they only managed to lose to Israel, which is 20,770km2, for a ratio of 1,078.6. Its successor, Russia, is smaller, at just over 17mkm2, but managed a bit better with a loss to Qatar, whose area is 11,586km2, for a ratio of 1,475.8. \u201cNext we go to the second biggest country, Canada, at just under 10mkm2. Their loss to the Faroe Islands is a good starting point, as the Faroes\u2019 area is only 1,393km2, for a ratio of 7,167.7, narrowly beaten by India\u2019s loss. But Canada has not had the last word. In 2001 they traveled to Malta for a friendly. Their 2-1 loss is a record breaker, as Malta\u2019s area is only 316km2, for a massive 31,597.1 ratio. There aren\u2019t many optional match ups with a higher ratio, so I\u2019m gonna go ahead and say it\u2019s probably the record.\u201d Meanwhile, Opeyemi Ajal is of the opinion that \u201cthe relative footballing terms can top the absolute population terms. Despite the 169-place distance between Faroe Islands with a population of 49,117 and the 2004 European Championship winners Greece with 11,183,716, Faroe Islands beat the Greeks 1-0 in 2014, a feat repeated on 13 June 2015 by a score of 2\u20131.\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cFulham defender Zesh Rehman made his debut for Pakistan, who are ranked 168 by Fifa. Is that the lowest-ranked country a Premier League player has played for?\u201d wondered Zulfiqar Shah in January 2006. \u201cIt\u2019s not actually,\u201d says Paul Waiting. \u201cDuring Shaun Goater\u2019s final season as a Premier League player with Manchester City, Bermuda (his country) fell as low as 180, giving him the dubious record of playing for the lowest-ranked team of any then-Premier League player. Interestingly, if it hadn\u2019t been for a change of international allegiances, the mark would be held by Everton\u2019s Australian international, Tim Cahill. He represented Samoa at under-20 level, before switching \u2013 Samoa currently lie 182nd in Fifa\u2019s rankings.\u201d \u2022 For thousands more questions and answers look through our archive.
