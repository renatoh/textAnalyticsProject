Advisers to both exchanges met in New York on Monday to thrash out details of a possible deal, following meetings between the two companies' principals in Paris last week. Any deal is expected to be presented as a cash-and-shares takeover of Euronext by the NYSE. An insider said talks between the two were at an advanced stage. The NYSE's arch-rival, Nasdaq, has built a stake of about 24% in the London Stock Exchange."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
