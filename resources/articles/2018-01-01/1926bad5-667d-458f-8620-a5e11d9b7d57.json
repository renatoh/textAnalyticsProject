He grew up in a family with dogs \u2013 his parents are doggy even now, the owners of a glossy black labrador only slightly less tall than my partner\u2019s mum. When that family get together, they reminisce about pets past, and brass-labelled urns that inter the ashy remains of their furry departed are arranged in a row along the top of the household piano. But no, I said, despite his pleading, we live in an apartment. We cannot take care of a dog. My partner whimpered but there was no arguing about it. We first cohabited in north Melbourne \u2013 the flat was an exposed brick warehouse conversion, six floors up. Its clay balcony was too hot and shadeless for any mammal\u2019s comfort, including mine. Yet if we lived in that place too long, it was perhaps because I was resolute in not wanting the dog my partner so desired. Yes, the canine aversion really was that strong. When I was three, a whippet was brought home to the house, wrapped in a baby\u2019s blanket \u2013 the puppy was a present for me, and I named him Jim. I remember how pale he was, how much I loved him, how he would sleep on top of my bed while I slept in it and how devastated I was when we moved back to Sydney from Canberra \u2013 and had to give him away. We were staying with Nanna, whose fibro house lacked the necessary fences for a whippet, and Jim got out. My mother relates the subsequent arrival at the door of a weeping, angry woman, a flurry of tears, the accusation that our Jim had murdered all her chickens. \u201cAnd,\u201d she wailed, \u201cI\u2019m pregnant!\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think that one can be pinned on the dog,\u201d my mother offered. A fissure within was created by my childhood separation from the dog and perhaps it was deeper and more serious than I could understand, because by the time I was a teenager, I both hated and was terrified of dogs. Let me hereby apologise to the kind American family who effectively had to intern their beloved hounds during my stay with them in Illinois, for the friendly pups pounced and I started screaming from the moment I entered their home. To the woman recovering from a car accident whose tiny, terrier companion had me so freaked out in a community meeting in London that I squatted on a plastic chair while friends formed a human shield between me and a fluffy antagonist barely larger than a slipper. To the boss in Sydney whose hapless, slobbering sidekick merely had to pad around a corner for me to be rendered frozen and bloodless with horror. My god, I\u2019m amazed I was invited anywhere. Then came the day my partner complained down the phone of a frustrating afternoon at work and I \u2013 distracted, unthinking \u2013 suggested he take a break and visit the pet shop near his office for a change of scene. Too soon, a second phone call. He\u2019d seen a puppy. It was miserable, pet shops are awful, it had to be rescued, this instant. When my partner arrived home with puppy, puppy leashes, puppy collars, puppy pills, puppy pillows, puppy toys and puppy food, it was also with a puppy cage that reeked because the puppy had panic-shat itself in the train. My partner cleaned it, and it cried. I wouldn\u2019t touch it, I was furious. When he brought the shy little animal to the couch, I noticed it was swaddled in one of my blankets and relocated myself to the armchair in a huff. Despite the palatial accommodation my partner created for it in the back room of the house, the puppy sobbed all night. My partner went to comfort it, I lay in the bed and raged. \u201cI have a deadline tomorrow!\u201d I barked. When I woke up after but an hour of sleep, it was to the discovery that the dog had painted the walls of the room with its poo. I fled to the office before my partner left for work and sobbed to my mother over the phone. When she pointed out the alternative was to move back in with her, I committed to just try to last the week. When I got home, my partner was sponging dog wee out of my rug. My rug. Mine. The dog has since destroyed three of my blankets, my hot water bottle and a brocade for my hair, torn the zipper from my favourite dressing gown and succeeded in the relentless pillage of books, papers, bills, iPhone cords and household plants in my nominal (it seems, temporary) possession. The dog and I clearly share the same taste as he\u2019s taken fatal bites out of five pairs of my shoes, and a noticeable munch out of the last pair of boots I have left to walk around in. This is not to imply the dog spares his own toys from his viciousness \u2013 we have taken to photographing the mortal remains of the shredded Mr Bear, Mr Dog, Froggy, Elfy and Little Bear to note their resemblance to mob hits. In his attempts to comfort the monster he brought into our house, my partner \u2013 besotted \u2013 has placed beds for the dog on the verandah, in the lounge room, kitchen and library, though the dog\u2019s favourite bed is in the dining room, on a floor cushion the shape of an elephant\u2019s head \u2013 that obviously, once, belonged to me \u2013 which at night he curls into like a transformed rajah in a fairytale. During the day, the dog prefers the couch. With me. It is here he is right now, asleep, curled under my arm while I write, his snout against my shoulder, his little paws reaching out to touch the edges of his own doggy dreams. And I stop to watch him, and I smile, and I tell the dog I love him, and he smiles for the gentle sound of the words and snuggles closer to me in his sleep. It was my partner\u2019s mum who finally explained the dog to me. \u201cYou just have to let him love you,\u201d she said, the day the dog was bashing paint chunks from the back door, when I was trying to write and he just wouldn\u2019t stop barking. \u201cYou just have to let him love you,\u201d she repeated, and she repeated it until I calmed down, and the dog calmed down, and he stopped barking, and I let him back in. And whether I\u2019m pulling toy stuffing out of his mouth, or washing bits of a rat he\u2019s mutilated from his fur, or dumping another wrecked pair of shoes in the bin, and smiling about it \u2013 laughing about it \u2013 happy about it, I do wonder (of course I wonder) if this may have indeed been the true source of my terror, all this time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
