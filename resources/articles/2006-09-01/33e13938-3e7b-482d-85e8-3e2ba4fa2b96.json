Borthwick, England's lineout tactician, injured his knee against Leicester this month. His club described the problem as a \"non-issue\" last week but yesterday admitted the 26-year-old had surgery on Monday to repair a ligament tear and no date had yet been set for his comeback with the lock walking with crutches. \"Steve needs to have total rest and recuperation for the next couple of weeks after which his situation will be reassessed,\" said Bath's acting head coach Steve Meehan. \"When he is examined after that we will have a fair idea of when we can expect him back. He is a very important member of our squad but it is too early to say when he will be back on the field.\" England's head coach Andy Robinson has enough problems with the start of England's World Cup defence less than a year away without more injury concerns. Three former national captains, Lawrence Dallaglio, Phil Vickery and Jonny Wilkinson, are among members of the elite squad out of action, while another World Cup winner Mike Tindall has yet to play for Gloucester this season. England have lost their last five games and Robinson needs to lay down a marker in the test against the All Blacks at Twickenham having survived a Rugby Football Union cull of his management team in the summer and a review of the national set-up which led to the appointment of Rob Andrew as the director of elite rugby. Borthwick is a fixture in his pack and the second-row was outstanding in the defeat by New Zealand last November, as well as being one of the few players to emerge from the wreckage of last season's Six Nations campaign with their reputations intact. Twickenham will host four internationals in November. The Barbarians had hoped to make the figure five with a midweek fixture against Australia at the end of the month, the start of what the International Rugby Board hoped would be a revival of the traditional end-of-tour fixture. But fears that spectators would stay away, having had a surfeit of Test rugby, prompted the invitation club to jettison the idea. \"It is disappointing that we will not be playing the Barbarians but it is not the end of the world,\" said Australia's coach John Connolly, who had intended to field an experimental side in the match."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
