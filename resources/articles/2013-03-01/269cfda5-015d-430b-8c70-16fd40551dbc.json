Peacock's individual effort in the 51st minute had been the only score of an absorbing second half, as the Rhinos underlined their champions' qualities by resisting countless Bradford attacks. But it was indiscipline by the former England captain that cost Leeds what would surely have been a match-winning drop goal. Tensions boiled over in the last 10 minutes and Peacock was penalised for pushing the Bradford youngster John Bateman seconds before Kevin Sinfield found the target. That allowed the Bulls to stay within six points of their local rivals at 18-12 down and, with two minutes remaining, Peacock was shown the yellow card for dissent. With their defence reduced to 12 men, the Rhinos finally cracked, as Sidlow charged on to Heath L'Estrange's subtle delayed pass. Jamie Foster added a cool conversion that would have been simple in other circumstances, and the Bulls supporters on the western terrace behind the posts celebrated a point, and a performance, that confirms their side as a Super League force again after years of decline on and off the field. \"You've got to enjoy these moments,\" said Francis Cummins, who has made such a positive initial impression since succeeding Mick Potter as Bradford's coach after spending two decades at Leeds as a player and then on their backroom staff. \"The fact that we found a way to come back against the Super League champions is pleasing.\" The Leeds coach, Brian McDermott, a former Bulls stalwart, was unconvinced that Peacock had been guilty of dissent and was furious about a spear tackle by Elliott Whitehead, Bradford's otherwise excellent second-row, which sparked a second-half brawl. The game had been compelling from the start, with Kallum Watkins opening the scoring for Leeds with a try after 24 seconds and the Bulls replying 12 minutes later with a brilliant move rounded off by Adrian Purtell. The Australian centre was playing his third game since suffering a heart attack after a defeat by Leeds last May.Sidlow's try kept Bradford a point ahead of Leeds in sixth place in the Super League table but the Rhinos have two games in hand. Catalan Dragons surged to the top by coming from behind to beat London Broncos 30-24 in Thursday night's other game in the unusual surroundings of Esher rugby union club, where the game was switched at short notice because the Twickenham Stoop is waterlogged. Wigan or St Helens could overtake the Catalans when they open up a busy and mouthwatering Good Friday programme with a lunchtime derby."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
