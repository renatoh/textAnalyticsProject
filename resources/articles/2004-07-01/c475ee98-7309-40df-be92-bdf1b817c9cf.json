Tim Bowdler", "bodyText": "Job: chief executive, Johnston Press Age: 57 Industry: publishing Company turnover: \u00a3491.8m Staff: 7,772 Salary: \u00a3723,000 (including bonus) 2003 ranking: 74 Tim Bowdler famously tried to cancel his interview for the job of chief executive of Johnston Press, fearing he knew too little about the media industry to be a success. Ten years on, the company is the fourth largest publisher of local and regional newspapers in the country. Despite an unlikely sounding background in engineering, Mr Bowdler's stewardship has seen Johnston's stock market value rise from \u00a365m to around \u00a31.6bn. Helped by the takeover of the Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspaper Group in 1999 and the Yorkshire Post's parent, Regional Independent Media, in a \u00a3560m deal two years ago, Johnston Press now publishes 241 weekly and daily newspapers. While other media groups have preached the gospel of diversification, Johnston has stuck steadfastly to the familiar territory of the local press with its mission statement, \"Life is local\". It recently sold its 33% stake in Two Boroughs Radio, an interest it acquired with the takeover of RIM. Mr Bowdler's strategy may be less glamorous, but it has paid dividends. In a turbulent few years for the newspaper industry, with ad revenues tumbling as a result of the dotcom crash and the uncertain climate created by conflict in the Middle East, Johnston has remained a remarkably steady ship. Last year it announced pre-tax profits of \u00a3128m, up 38% on 2002. Although Johnston is now widely thought to be gearing up for another acquisition in the regional press, Mr Bowdler has refused to rush into a deal, ignoring the recent sale of Trinity Mirror's local papers in Northern Ireland. \"I will not rule out any acquisitions, but we are not in a position where we want to rush into anything. There is plenty we can do with the continuing operations,\" he said recently."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
