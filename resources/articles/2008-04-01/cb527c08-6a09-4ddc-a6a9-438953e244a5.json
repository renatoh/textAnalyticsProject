I must have been about eight and, with three years' gardening under my belt, I was hungry for knowledge and experience. Hill Cottage offered that in the most natural way, for the garden was completely overgrown with 50 years of neglect. So we learned as we went along, clearing space and discovering, as if we were working through chapters in a book. I have written about this before because it was such an important stage in my life, but it was also a pretty unusual garden. Miss Joy, the old lady who had lived there before, had been a plantswoman, and beneath every mound of bramble or thicket of laurel was some hidden treasure. I came upon so many things that had survived, abandoned, for decades: wintersweet, decadent rhododendrons and even trilliums. But I'll never forget my first epimedium. It must have been around the turn of March into April. The celandines were shining, new blades bent over on the grass, and there was the froth of amelanchier all through the garden. I was clearing brambles with a scythe when I came upon something I'd never seen before. Small arching flowers, like tiny columbines of the palest primrose yellow, hovered on wire-thin stems. There were just a handful in flower, with buds yet to come, and emerging from last year's foliage was a new layer pushing through. The leaves were small, heart-shaped in embryo and still unformed, but I revisited them over the next week. Infused with copper and bronze, and mottled with deep red veining, the foliage flattened out and expanded like a moth from a chrysalis. For a week, maybe two, they were the most beautiful thing I had ever seen, and we picked the flowers to add to bunches of primroses and sky-blue scilla - our new prize from the wilderness. If anything epitomises the fugitive moment of spring it is the epimedium, and it wasn't long before this fleeting show was over and the parent plant merged back into the greenery. Apparently fragile, and capable of such a mercurial transformation, Epimedium x versicolor 'Sulphureum' caught my attention then and continues to hold it today. Here was a plant able to make do in dry shade, without division and with what little leaf mould might have accumulated around its crown. Back then, there was a limited range of mostly European species and hybrids which hailed from the Caucasus. These are able to cope with dry shade and some exposure once established, and with more or less evergreen foliage they make the most perfect ground-cover plants. Beth Chatto and Graham Stuart Thomas were already adept in their usage, and when I looked for more I found what, for a while at least, became the backbone of shady ground-cover plantings. E x perralchicum 'Frohnleiten' is one of the toughest, forming an impenetrable mat with glossy foliage that tires only once the new buds of next year start to form at ground level in March. Get the timing right and you can shear last year's leaves back to the base to reveal new, bronze-veined foliage and bright yellow flowers. I love this plant, but have recently fallen for a closely related selection from Junker's Nursery (junker.co.uk) called E 'Black Sea'. It has shiny green foliage that darkens to glossy purple-black in winter. Once the search was on I found there were more delicate and demure epimediums, too: E pubigerum, with creamy white flowers that dance on the wiry stems in April, and E grandiflorum 'Niveum', with chocolate foliage and tiny white 'columbines'. Later came the rather better E grandiflorum 'Lilafee', now a favourite, with bronzed foliage and deep-purple flowers, but then, by chance, I discovered the epimediums from Asia. It was like stumbling upon orchids when I rounded the corner in Beth Chatto's woodland garden and encountered E davidii. It was only introduced here from Sichuan in 1985. With cocoa-red foliage and yellow flowers suspended above the new leaves, it has an unmistakably oriental mood and got me hungry for more. Unlike their European cousins, they depend upon the damp and dappled light that comes with leaf mould at the woodland edge. This, coupled with the fact that they prefer free drainage, puts them in the same camp as other choice woodlanders, such as meconopsis, trillium, podophyllum and ferns, but I was not deterred, nor have I been disappointed so far in my garden. In fact, as I find myself with more shade as the trees and shrubs mature, they have been rather perfect, as long as they are well mulched in late winter. E fargesii 'Pink Constellation' is aptly named, with its myriad tiny lilac flowers. These form on sprays with a gypsophila-like grace, set above dark matt foliage shaped like arrowheads, with a holly-like jagged edge. I haven't dared cut any of my Asian species back just before flowering, as I do the tough Europeans, for fear I might weaken the plants, so I have left the new foliage to come through of its own accord. This is one of their greatest assets, and several are mottled and piebald with reds and green when new leaves are expanding. E myrianthum has red mottling on the foliage which fades to green. Mine are starting to flower, with the promise of 200 tiny white flowers on each stem. Of those I have tested so far, E wushanense is the most extraordinary. Its leaves, which can be a hand-span long, have a prehistoric feeling, like armour. They are olive green above and barbed, but turn them over and they are covered in a light-absorbing jade blue felting. I have the straight species against a north-facing wall and it flowered until June, with arching stems that can reach up to a metre. The flowers are cream and 5cm across, and they pepper the plant as they come in succession. I have ordered a form called 'Caramel', which refers to the colour of the flowers. I've no idea where it will go because my obsession has run to at least a dozen, but I'm savouring this new chapter too much to not just go with the flow. \u00b7 dan.pearson@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
