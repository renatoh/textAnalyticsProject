Jason Day is 31st on the same list, Sergio Garc\u00eda has slipped to 35th and Bubba Watson is 41st. Nonetheless the scale of Spieth\u2019s arrival into professional golf \u2013 whereby he won two majors in 2015 and added another two years later \u2013 means his subsequent tribulations are worthy of attention. The last of Spieth\u2019s 11th main tour wins was the Open Championship of 2017. \u201cI\u2019ll probably be better than I ever was because of it and have better perspective as well,\u201d Spieth says of his recent struggles. This next week will sting for Spieth, just as it will serve as an indicator of how far his star has fallen. He did not secure automatic qualification for the USA\u2019s Presidents Cup team and was not a back-up pick either, meaning this weekend\u2019s Hero World Challenge will conclude his 2019 while friends and colleagues fly to Melbourne. \u201cIt will be tough for me at home,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll try and just get away while the tournament\u2019s going on because you never want to miss those events when you\u2019ve been a part of them for a number of years. \u201cWhen it\u2019s being played without being there? That will be where I\u2019ll probably say: \u2018I took it for granted.\u2019 I\u2019ll certainly work my butt off not to miss one of these again. I always liked the lead-in and the playing practice rounds together, preparing to be a team representing your country. Yeah, it\u2019s tough.\u201d Spieth\u2019s diligence has never been in question. He has admirable perspective on life but when asked how his toils have impacted upon him, technicality is the theme. \u201cI\u2019m hitting shots and I\u2019m like: \u2018Something feels off and I can\u2019t quite figure it out,\u2019\u201d the 26-year-old adds. \u201cThat\u2019s been the toughest part for me because I know when I\u2019m in control, I will put myself in position. I have the confidence mentally when I\u2019m in control of the mechanical side of things to win out here and to contend week in and week out.\u201d So what actually happened to Spieth, once the kid tipped to redefine top-level golf? His putting, outstanding as the Masters, US Open and Open were won, deserted him for a spell. Whereas that problem appears close to resolution, driving accuracy \u2013 or lack of \u2013 continues as a hindrance. He found just 53% of fairways last season and was 181st on the PGA Tour. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not just one thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI wish it was easy to say one thing but if it was then I would have already figured it out. I think it\u2019s just part of the game. Tiger [Woods] set a standard of dominance that is very difficult to match, impossible I would say, at this point, to match.\u201d Spieth is a rarity in an individual sporting environment as many others are willing him to bounce back. The Texan is such a decent, respectful and grounded individual that he did not offend anyone when the going was good. Throughout 2019, when top-10 finishes were a rarity and frustration frequently apparent, Spieth was as candid as he was courteous. This week in the Bahamas, he has been able to play with an element of freedom. \u201cIt\u2019s a little easier when you\u2019re not having to play a full schedule where every day you wake up and you\u2019re like: \u2018I know that I\u2019m not there but I\u2019ve got to go do it anyway,\u2019\u201d Spieth says. \u201cThat gets tough sometimes. So it\u2019s nice to have the off-season and play a few events. The season ending in August this year is, I think, good timing for me.\u201d Spieth wants the new year to deliver the narrative with which he was once so accustomed.
