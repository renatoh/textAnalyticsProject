But after watching his former team-mates from last year\u2019s Under-19 European Championship become world champions in South Korea at the weekend, the 19-year-old Chelsea striker believes the country\u2019s current crop of young players can handle the pressure that infamous moniker brings with it. Abraham, who scored 23 league goals last season on loan at Bristol City, could easily have been part of Paul Simpson\u2019s Under-20 World Cup-winning squad had his services not been required in Poland this week. Instead, he was with the rest of Aidy Boothroyd\u2019s Under-21 squad at St George\u2019s Park as they prepared for this week\u2019s European Championship when England completed their 1-0 victory over Venezuela. \u201cIt\u2019s massively inspiring,\u201d said Abraham. \u201cWe\u2019re going into a massive tournament now with the Under-21s and it would be nice to end it on a blast. The boys are confident. We\u2019ve had a great season. We just want to top off with a win. Some of the lads have played in the Premier League, in top teams, we have an amazing team. Hopefully we can show that. We\u2019re all excited. We just have to prove it.\u201d Yet while the promise of youth never quite materialised on the full international stage for David Beckham, Michael Owen et al, there was a genuine feeling of optimism as England\u2019s players trained for the first time on Polish soil after arriving on Monday. Several of the players in Boothroyd\u2019s squad were part of the side that won last year\u2019s Toulon tournament for the first time in 22 years, while the likes of Abraham and Leicester\u2019s Ben Chilwell will still be young enough to play in this tournament in two years\u2019 time. Given the success he has enjoyed since representing England for the first time at Under-18 level, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that Abraham \u2013 or to give him his full name, Kevin Oghenetega Tamaraebi Bakumo-Abraham \u2013 did not appear phased by the comparison with that previous era. \u201cWe definitely can handle that tag,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have guys who are talented, can work hard and have everything. It\u2019s just about blending in and becoming one, not just thinking about yourself.\u201d It is that last statement in particular that stands out about this England set-up. The continuity that has seen Gareth Southgate step into the senior role, with Boothroyd moving up from his role with the Under-20s, has clearly fostered a strong team ethic that Abraham, who was part of the England side that lost out to Italy in the semi-finals of the Under-19s last year, hopes they can replicate in Poland \u2013 starting with their opening match against holders Sweden on Friday. \u201cLast year team bonding was really important. We were out there for a long while, longer than this time and we had to stay focused,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are times you need more than talent and so you have to make sure you give your all and leave everything out there on the pitch. \u201cYou could see [the Under 20s] had no fear, they played with confidence. They all had a smile on their face. We have to show no fear as well, take our confidence into these games. Every age group is like family and the bond of the team should get us through, even if tough times come.\u201d Abraham has admitted he remains unsure which club he will play for next season, with promoted duo Brighton and Newcastle understood to have lodged an interest with Chelsea in taking him on a season-long loan. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to Chelsea yet but they know I\u2019m focusing on this tournament so the discussions will happen after,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not too sure [where I will play] but hopefully it will be in the Premier League. After this season I need to take myself to the next level. That\u2019s the type of person I am, I always want to do better. I always want to do more. So going into the new season my aim will be to top this one.\u201d Joining Andrea Pirlo, Klaas Jan-Huntelaar and Alvaro Morata on the list of players to have won the Golden Boot at this tournament in recent years would certainly be a strong statement at a time when Chelsea\u2019s forward options for next season are very much in flux. Despite being the only teenager in the England squad, that is very much in Abraham\u2019s sights, although it is his desire to end the summer with his own winners\u2019 medal that is really driving the player from Camberwell in south London. \u201cI haven\u2019t really had a look at who\u2019s won the Golden Boot here before. But hopefully I can win it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Under-20s did the country so proud and we would love to follow in their footsteps by winning the Euros. Obviously being Under-21s we want to show we are the next up and coming players for the England squad, so there is a bit of pressure. But then we have some amazing lads so we think we can go far as well. We can\u2019t have them bragging they won and we didn\u2019t.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
