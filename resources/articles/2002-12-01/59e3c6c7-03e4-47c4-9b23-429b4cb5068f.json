This decision follows hot on the heels of the \"ghost town Britain\" report by the New Economics Foundation, which drew attention to the difficulties of maintaining vital and viable local retail systems. The real problem which this decision reflects is an incremental and inconsistent approach to retail regulation. The \"big five\" supermarkets now account for about 70% of the market. Key ingredients in their success are the influence they exert on the food chain and on competition and planning authorities. Assessing particular retail initiatives requires clear and consistent thinking. A useful mechanism for developing consistent policy is to look at the issue in the same way as the retailers - in terms of whether or not they are giving consumers \"what they want\". Consumer experiences of competition ought to be a crucial \"anchor point\" for the government's approach to retail policy but beg a fuller understanding of how different groups of consumers use and experience multiple and independent stores. Looking at retail competition through the \"lens\" of consumer choice, as we do in our current ESRC-funded research, will provide the guiding insight necessary to achieve a delicate balance across varied policy-making arenas. It should be possible to extrapolate from this understanding to assess the implications for consumers of what might happen next - a few examples being the effects of 24-hour trading, of additional road congestion on the competitiveness of those retailers able to maintain extended hours, and of large retail multiples taking over smaller convenience operators. At the heart of this idea is a more proactive approach to planning, rooted in the experiences of consumers making retail choices within constantly changing local competitive situations. The key question is whether consumers feel they have sufficient choice and, if not, how can policy be used to address such situations? Prof Ian Clarke Lancaster University Management School and four colleagues \u00b7 One of the reasons why consumers continue to patronise the supermarkets while regretting the loss of small shops is because they believe that supermarkets offer cheaper goods. That is simply not the case. Get out of your cars more and try shopping in small shops and you will find competitive prices, quality goods and brilliant service, not to mention diversity and human scale. As an example, I regularly buy meat from my local butcher, and his chicken fillets are almost the same price as those in local supermarkets but the quality is superb - no excess water and with real taste. Fruit and veg from local greengrocers are invariably cheaper and fresher that supermarket produce.
