In the days of double-digit inflation, pensioners saw their money buy less each year, while homeowners could expect to see the real value of their debt fall as a result of rising prices. Investors expected high returns on their savings accounts and endowment policies, while employees grew accustomed to hefty wage increases. Evidence that times have changed came last week in a warning from the UK's financial watchdog, Sir Howard Davies, that investors should not expect unrealistically high returns in an era of low inflation and low interest rates. Sir Howard, chairman of the financial services authority, said headline inflation was expected to remain at around the government's target rate of 2.5% for the foreseeable future, so consumers must \"adjust their expectations\". He added: \"Savers need to understand that low inflation means lower nominal returns.\" Britain has had long periods of low inflation before. For most of its history, inflation has only occurred during wars, with the price level actually lower at the start of the first world war in 1914 than it was at the time of the Battle of Waterloo 99 years earlier. But during the 1970s and 1980s inflation rose sharply on three separate occasions, leading to the belief that it was ever-present. Some homebuyers relying on endowment policies to pay off their mortgages at the end of 25 years have already been given a glimpse of what the new era means. Policy-holders have received letters telling them that low inflation and low interest rates mean that the returns may not be sufficient to provide a pot of money big enough to pay off the loan. They may have to top up their payments or make up the shortfall when their policy matures. Wage bargainers are also coming to grips with annual pay awards well below those routinely granted in the 1970s and 1980s. Earnings, even when swelled by City bonuses, were 5% higher in the three months ending in February than they were a year earlier. Settlements in both manufacturing and services are running at a lower level. Mortgage lenders are also beginning to adopt a more cautious approach to people seeking to borrow. In the days when house prices could be expected to rise rapidly year after year, a bank or building could lend, safe in the knowledge that even if it had to repossess a property it could be sold for a profit. In a low-inflation country, the risk of a loan turning sour is greater for both borrower and lenders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
