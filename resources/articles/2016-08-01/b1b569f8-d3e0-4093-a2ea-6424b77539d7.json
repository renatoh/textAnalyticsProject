An 11th-placed finish at that tournament at The Hague proved the catalyst for the return of the inspirational coach Danny Kerry and the captain, Kate Richardson-Walsh, to come out of semi-retirement for one last crack at gold. Two years later they were dancing in a Rio hotel to We Are The Champions having pulled off a dramatic shootout victory over the reigning champions, the Netherlands, in the Olympic final, following a tournament that featured eight straight wins. \u201cWe sat round and people got things off their chest, things that were frustrating,\u201d recalls Hollie Webb, who scored the decisive penalty shuffle that sent her team-mates and upwards of nine million viewers watching back home into raptures. \u201cLooking back now it was horrific at the time but we learned from it and got to where we are now,\u201d she said. Almost to a woman, all of those who celebrated wildly on the blue Deodoro pitch referenced both Kerry \u2013 a tactical \u201cmagician\u201d according to Alex Danson \u2013 and their captain, Richardson-Walsh, as key factors in their success. On the morning after the night before the defender Sam Quek said the newly retired captain, who will go off to play club hockey in Holland with her wife and GB team-mate, Helen Richardson-Walsh, was irreplaceable. \u201cKate is a one-off. There will not be another leader like Kate. She is just an inspiration to everyone. Everything she does is so thorough. She is the most caring, thoughtful person in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the same time, if you put a little foot out of line or you need your socks pulling up, she\u2019ll be first to say so.\u201d But the other theme that comes through is the bond created during the long hours of training at Bisham Abbey \u2013 where they installed an exact replica of the Rio pitch and endlessly drilled for every eventuality \u2013 as a development squad of 31. \u201cI can\u2019t describe the feeling. We are a group of 31 people that has been put together. We wouldn\u2019t necessarily be best friends outside hockey as we\u2019re all different personalities. We\u2019ve all been put together and I think it\u2019s so special how we all work together and are so close because of it,\u201d said Webb. \u201cAnd we all compete against each other. I am competing against Sam for the same position and yet I want her to do well as well. I can think of hardly any other situations where you get that.\u201d In the wake of victory Danson also tried to sum up the shared values that had been drummed into them in the long hours at Bisham Abbey . \u201cWe set our stall out. We wanted to create history. We wanted to inspire the future and we wanted to be the difference. It\u2019s about having a team with a set of values, a vision, that you dare to put out there. We probably spent hours and hours of our programme back at Bisham in meetings, talking about how we want to be and what we want to deliver on. That\u2019s aside from the tactics, that\u2019s on top,\u201d she said. \u201c\u201cI believe more than anything that\u2019s what has won us the medal here. It\u2019s the 31 girls at home, it\u2019s every person who has ever put on a GB shirt and it\u2019s a magician who has put the tactics together.\u201d For Webb there is a neat symmetry in the fact that she was inspired to play hockey as a nine-year-old watching Richardson-Walsh in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney and will now have the opportunity to capitalise on the huge boost in exposure offered the sport as a result of their prime-time victory. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing I\u2019m most excited about. It\u2019s not the medal we got last night, which is obviously incredible. If you look on social media, it\u2019s the people back home that have been inspired by us and by watching us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had messages like: \u2018I am going to dig my old hockey stick and get back into it.\u2019 That is the most special thing for me. People are now noticing hockey. They\u2019ve seen it on the TV and loved it and want to get involved with it. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d As Britain\u2019s women thrived, however, Britain\u2019s men floundered, failing to progress from the group stage. Barry Middleton\u2019s side finished above only the hosts, Brazil, whom they beat 9-1 for their sole win from five games. Two draws and two defeats in their other matches meant Britain made an early exit from the tournament."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
