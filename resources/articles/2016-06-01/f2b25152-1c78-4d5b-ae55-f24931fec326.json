Broncos spokesman Patrick Smyth said the injury is not life-threatening, and the team are gathering more information as it comes in. Medical City Hospital confirmed that the 30 year-old Talib had been released from their care on Sunday morning after receiving treatment. Talib had been due to travel with his team to the White House on Monday to meet Barack Obama in a ceremony honoring the Broncos\u2019 Super Bowl win earlier this year. Talib keeps an off season home in Dallas, and has had brushes with the law in the past. In 2011 he was indicted on assault charges after he allegedly pistol whipped his sister\u2019s partner. The charges were later dropped due to a lack of evidence. Last year, he was questioned by police at the scene of an assault in a Dallas nightclub but no charges were brought. Talib was drafted in the first round of the 2008 draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and has also played for the New England Patriots. He has been named to the Pro Bowl three times. Talib\u2019s shooting is not the first incident of gun violence involving an NFL player this offseason. In April, former New Orleans Saint Will Smith was shot and killed in an apparent road rage incident."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
