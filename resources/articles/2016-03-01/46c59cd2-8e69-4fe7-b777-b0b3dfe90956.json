It is, according to the blurb, the \u201cultimate match-day experience\u201d where clients can browse designer handbags, shoes, jewellery and the kind of temptations you might not ordinarily expect while waiting for Eliaquim Mangala to trip up over his own legs. There is a cocktail bar, personal shopping assistants, a menu of different pampering treatments and a selection of perfumed ladies who can apply the latest shades of nail varnish, all within an 8ft by 11ft box. It is arranged by someone going by the title of Relationship Manager \u2013 and there might even be a game of football if everyone remembers to look outside the tinted windows. The club has certainly changed immeasurably since my early days of covering it on a regular basis when the first welcome used to be the sandpaper rasp of Mike Corbett, a former bombardier and native of Glasgow, greeting visitors from a cabin decorated with posters of Ricky Hatton. These days, it is a small army of blazer-wearing officials with earpieces and walkie-talkies. Directors are ferried around in chauffeur-driven limousines, menus are put together by Michelin-starred chefs and, looking at some of the more unsuccessful signings, there is a level of expenditure that reminds me of an old line by a former Guardian colleague, David Hopps, in the years when Leeds United had ambitions to be part of the super-rich. \u201cThe Leeds programme has a team\u2011sheet so glossy that it is impossible to write on it,\u201d Hopps wrote. \u201cThey should have given Peter Ridsdale chequebooks like that.\u201d The difference, of course, is that City are never going to run out of money, sitting on a 10th of the planet\u2019s oil reserves and operating with the kind of long-term strategy that means nobody can suspect any longer the people bankrolling the club from Abu Dhabi are merely passing through. Pep Guardiola is on his way and the new manager has the restorative powers, the football intelligence and force of personality that make it easy to understand why so many people envisage a new period of domination in English football. Yet Guardiola\u2019s brief also entails winning the Champions League and that is not going to be straightforward when City\u2019s chequebook has often been used so unproductively in the transfer market \u2013 combined with Manuel Pellegrini, like many of his players, being off form for the last 18 months \u2013 we are now in the almost implausible position where the manager in waiting is inheriting a team that might not qualify for next season\u2019s competition. Another Premier League manager \u2013 a man I would regard as one of the more astute members of the profession \u2013 confided over lunch recently that he thought City needed another eight or nine players if they were to become the team that Guardiola would want them to be. \u201cPep is not the problem,\u201d was the gist of it. \u201cHe is too good not to make it work.\u201d It was the next line that resonated. \u201cThere is a problem though,\u201d he added, \u201cand it\u2019s the players.\u201d It has certainly been a strange season for City bearing in mind they have won the Capital One Cup, as well as reaching the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time, but still leave the distinct impression of having regressed in the last couple of years. As Roy Keane put it, that it is \u201ccuckoo land\u201d to believe the current team, lacking structure and plainly in decline, will be passing around the European Cup at San Siro on 28 May. For that, a sizeable amount of the blame has to be directed towards Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain, the two executives who have targeted the wrong players, overspent on others and generally had such an erratic record their own positions might have come under much scrutiny were it not for the professional background that made the Guardiola deal possible. Even then, there is a pile of evidence they have fallen short with their recruitment programme, however difficult it has been to negotiate Uefa\u2019s financial fair-play stipulations, and unfortunately for Pellegrini the same applies to his own work and the fundamental reasons why he is being let go at the end of the season with a year to go on his contract. The common misconception is that the deterioration coincides with Guardiola announcing he was moving to England and diminishing Pellegrini\u2019s status in front of the players now they know he has, in effect, already been fired in advance. The bottom line, however, is that City have actually been floundering ever since they began the season with five wins on the bounce. Since then, they have taken a mere 36 points from the subsequent 24 games. There have been eight defeats, one in every three matches, and a league table covering that period (seven out of the eight months played this season) would leave them in ninth position, 19 points off the top \u2013 and behind, among others, Southampton and Stoke City. Yes, we all know Manchester United have been wretched, lurching from one crisis to another and frequently leaving the sense that a bewildering manager and inadequate bunch of players do not fully understand what it means to wear the club\u2019s colours. And yes, this has been the worst Chelsea team of the Roman Abramovich era, encompassing possibly the most chastening experience of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s professional life. Yet, going into this weekend, United had taken more points than City since 13 September and Chelsea had the same. Over the same timeframe, West Bromwich Albion would be two points behind the team put together on Abu Dhabi riches and so would Bournemouth. This does not change the fact City\u2019s supporters can be remarkably optimistic about the new era and the changing face of a club that began the 21st century with a 1-1 draw at Crewe Alexandra and a 5-2 home defeat to Leeds. Nonetheless, it does feel like another overhaul might be necessary bearing in mind the evidence that is stacking up against the current personnel. If Guardiola studied City\u2019s results against the top-half teams, he would discover they have won two out of 13 games this season. What does it say that only one other club \u2013 Aston Villa, this season\u2019s Slapstick XI \u2013 have won fewer, or that City have gone 21 games without recording back-to-back victories and, again, that there is only Villa of all the top-division teams who have managed a longer stretch? Or, indeed, that the most expensively assembled squad in English football, featuring 11 players in the range of \u00a322m to \u00a355m, has managed only 13 goals from 14 away matches? The team has not recorded lower figures at the corresponding stages of any other season in the Sheikh Mansour era and only three clubs have scored fewer times. One is Tony Pulis\u2019s West Brom. The other two are in the relegation places \u2013 Sunderland and Newcastle. All this must be pretty startling for Guardiola and the mind goes back to an interview last summer with David James when the former City goalkeeper predicted his old club would not even finish in the top four. It seemed faintly preposterous at the time. Yet it turns out it is going to be a close-run thing and, for all Guardiola\u2019s gifts, the new man could probably be forgiven for looking at the league table and wondering if it might need more work than he initially anticipated. Fellaini escapes the dirty dozen Marouane Fellaini appears to have returned to the undistinguished role of being the player the Manchester United crowd dislike the most. The midfielder\u2019s substitution in the FA Cup tie against West Ham last weekend was greeted with unforgiving cheers and there was an unusually loud show of dissent when he wasted a shot in his team\u2019s latest ordeal against Liverpool in the Europa League. Ordinarily, this might be a suitable time to ask whether Fellaini has been so much worse than everyone else in Louis van Gaal\u2019s team or whether his diminished popularity is partly because he, more than anyone, has been held up as a symbol of the new, failing United, post-Ferguson. Yet it is not easy to sympathise when any assessment of the Belgian\u2019s performances has to take into account the frequency with which his elbows connect with opponents\u2019 heads and the damage he is risking in the process. Fellaini\u2019s flooring of Emre Can at Anfield 10 days ago merited a ban and there have been several other incidents, going back to his time at Everton, when it has been mystifying how he has not been punished properly. The list is considerable and includes a particularly blatant offence on Pablo Zabaleta in a Manchester derby, another that split open Joe Allen\u2019s nose in a Belgium-Wales match, as well as one on Swansea\u2019s Ki Sung-yueng and three separate incidents involving Can, Roberto Firmino and Dejan Lovren in the two ties against Liverpool. Add to that some of the other occasions when Fellaini\u2019s flailing limbs have connected with Martin Skrtel of Liverpool, Ron Vlaar of Aston Villa, James Tomkins of West Ham (another broken nose), Mike Williamson of Newcastle and the Arsenal pair of Per Mertesacker and Francis Coquelin. That makes a dozen, just to start with. These are only some of the noteworthy incidents and whether it is malice or carelessness, or maybe a combination of both, it is tempting to wonder how long it will be before his luck runs out. \u201cI just defend myself,\u201d Fellaini said. But that indicates opponents have been targeting him when there is no evidence of that whatsoever. Either Fellaini is going to be sent off soon or someone is going to get seriously hurt and, of the two, it would be preferable if a serial offender finally got some comeuppance. Day Pickles put the World Cup to rights Did you realise it was 50 years ago on Sunday since the security guards looking after the Jules Rimet trophy at the Methodist Central Hall in Westminster popped out for a coffee and returned to find the back window was open and the famous piece of 18-carat gold had been nabbed? What followed sounds like a 1960s version of Wallace and Gromit, involving ransom notes, various false leads, the possibility of a World Cup taking place without a trophy and so much worldwide media attention that when a dog named Pickles discovered the trophy, wrapped in newspaper in a bush in South Norwood, he was awarded a year\u2019s supply of food by Spillers, made Dog of the Year and even added to the VIP guestlist on the night Sir Alf Ramsey\u2019s boys held their winners\u2019 banquet. Pickles, a four-year-old mongrel, showed his appreciation by cocking his leg beneath the drinks table. His collar is now kept at the National Football Museum in Manchester and his former owner, David Corbett, popped in on Friday to see for himself. David, now 76, still lives in the house he bought with the reward money. He keeps a plaque for Pickles in the back garden - \u201cFinder of the World Cup, 1966\u201d - and I liked his account of what happened on the day he took the trophy to the police station. \u201cHmm,\u201d the desk sergeant said, in a voice that suggested someone was wasting his time. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look very world-cuppy to me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
