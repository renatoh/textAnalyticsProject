Whenever he performs even the most perfunctory of hit-ups, the Stoop breaks out with its beloved chant of \"Uuuuuuuuuuugooooooo!\" So you can imagine the racket when he beat three defenders for a dazzling solo try that secured Quins a home quarter-final in the Heineken Cup. And all that on his 200th appearance. It was a beautiful moment. It was also a neat way for him to remind the England selectors that, cast him to the Saxons though they may, he is not going quietly. \"I was disappointed to be in the Saxons,\" he said of last week's squad announcement. \"A lot of people have congratulated me on it but when you have ambitions like I do, it's a bit of a setback. But it's more important how you bounce back and I think I played a good game today.\" That he did but there is nothing new about that. You do not play 200 times for this lot without doing something right. If his international career has been bittier he is hungry to continue it, having played in England's first autumn international against Fiji before slipping down the order. And that ambition extends to the Lions tour this summer. \"Anyone who tells you they're not thinking about the Lions tour is lying. I'm not in this Six Nations squad but anything can happen. I proved that four years ago, when I managed to get on the tour to South Africa and played a big role on it.\" It may well be with this swaggering Harlequins team that he is able to stake his claim most persuasively. They remain top of the Premiership, of which they are the champions, and one last pool win, in Biarritz this weekend, will qualify them for the Heineken Cup quarter-finals as No1 seeds. That could well mean a date with Leinster, which would be poignant in light of their last appearance in the quarter-finals, in 2009 against the same opponents, the game that nearly broke the club over the Bloodgate affair. \"I've been here 11 years now and the way we've come on has been incredible,\" Monye said. \"We've grown up together and learnt some harsh lessons. But in and among all of that there's no surprise that the bars are still heaving and we sell out every week. One, we play a fantastic brand of rugby and, two, our supporters are so loyal. The same supporters who will come for a home quarter-final in the Heineken Cup are those who followed us to Moseley when we were relegated.\" The bond is so strong, indeed, that the playing side of the club would rather host their quarter-final at the Stoop. ERC try to persuade home clubs to move to bigger venues for the quarter-finals by increasing the share of the match revenue from 50% to 65. All Quins have to do is cross the road to Twickenham \u2013 65% of the take from an 80,000 gate there would be somewhat more than half of that from the 15,000 at the Stoop. But Conor O'Shea, Quins' director of rugby is adamant. \"We're going to play our quarter-final here, as long as the local council allow us,\" he said. \"Hopefully they will, because we want this place to be rocking. This is our home. \"I, for one, desperately want to play here, and I'm sure the boys do too. More people might be able to see us if it's across the way but hopefully we can do that later in the competition.\" Whether his chief executive sees it the same way remains to be seen. O'Shea's attitude, though, like Monye's popularity, speaks of a club in the shape of its life.
