He looked like a blond Elvis with piercing blue eyes and the body of someone only McDonald's could love. I was 20 and 13 stone and I hit him. I'm not sure where exactly, maybe somewhere underneath the chin. It was dark in the log cabin and the fist had only Sam's blasphemy for guidance. Even as I threw the punch I knew I should not have. When a summer camp counsellor hits one of his charges it is a clear sign he's lost control. But up there, somewhere in the woods of New York State, a million miles from civilisation, I went native. It was 3am, Sam had been swearing his head off for more than two hours and I couldn't take any more. A pause. Then Sam rolled out of his bunk, snarled something, and chinned me. As I went down with Sam's hands around my throat and the roar from the rest of the bunks in my ears, my mind went back through the checklist you learn on orientation back in the UK. I was desperate and the six-hour seminar given in the basement of some London university shortly before myself and scores of other counsellors flew out for what we were promised would be eight weeks of 'pure summer camp fun' (sic) was pretty much all I had as a reference point at that moment. I quickly discounted the useful advice to fry bacon on a travel iron when backpacking around the US; the exhortation never to talk to the Moonies at airports (summer camps lose around two counsellors a year this way) was unarguable; likewise the suggestion that drinking water from the tap rather than buying cans of Coke saves money was sound but not germane to the issue in hand: to stop the rotund fledgling psychopath from killing me in what remained of my boxer shorts. As we rolled around on the wooden floor I realised that nothing really prepares you for being a counsellor on a US summer camp, short of maybe becoming Charlie Bronson's art teacher. But then Charlie's teachers are probably paid more. After all, you don't accept $150 a week to do a round-the-clock job which back home would have the European Court of Justice hitting the books on the finer points of habeas corpus for the money. No, you do it for the experience. You do it because you're a student and you're idealistic and you want to put something back by working with inner-city kids. Or at least that's what hundreds of credulous university students will be telling themselves right now as they decide whether to depart for the hundreds of US summer camps dotted along America's East Coast. And, boy, are they in for a life-altering experience. Luckily the chanting from the bunks dragged one of the camp's head honchos out of bed and Sam was pulled off me. There then followed a serious Q&amp;A session with the camp's senior counsellors in which I had to admit that, yes, I had hit Sam, but, come on, like, he'd asked for it. This cut no ice at all and so it was decided that, to help me 'bond' with the vicious lump of puppy fat with Tourette's syndrome and a fixation with other people's mothers, I was to give Sam a piggy back to dinner every day. After all, it was only around 600 metres. My osteopath says that now, five years on, I might be over the worst... Somewhere I have a copy of Samuel Butler's Erewhon, which I took with me and in which I have marked no fewer than 56 specks of Biro, one for each day I was to spend at Indian Head Camp, NY State. For each day I intended to cross one of the specks out. It was my way of coping with the horrors. The Sam incident was on day 12. By day 20 I stopped counting. Why? Because I'd learnt something in the interim, for which I'm still grateful and which should stand any potential summer camp interns in good stead, although I still recommend full and comprehensive insurance. Essentially, it's this: there are some things you come across in life that are much bigger than you. And they will crush you if you stand up to them. They will take your soul and they will break it into small bleeding pieces. And one of these things is a US summer camp with 800 kids aged five to 14. Especially at 11 o' clock in the morning, just after they've had their juice breaks and they're all whizzing on sugar rushes like they're at Homelands. In these difficult circumstances you need a coping mechanism. You need to survive and you cannot hide. This is Survivor without the cash. This is Big Brother without the chance to end up being invited to B-list parties for the next 18 months. This is hell. The first thing to accept is that whatever the kids want to do, you do. You have no authority and they know it. You are denuded of any pretence of power. So, if they want to paint your face eight colours and stick M&amp;Ms in your ears, hey, fine. If they want a ghost story involving the late Princess of Wales, Cher and some guy called Chuckie who has a lisp, no problem. If they want to wear your favourite rugby shirt - go for it and, hey, don't worry about the juice stains. The vital point is you have to become like them. Only then will you start to win their friendship and have even a one in a million chance of getting them to breakfast on time. And the weird thing is, they do become friends and you do learn to love all of them - with the possible exception of Sam. Which is useful because they will be the only people you will see for pretty much the whole time you're there. You eat with them, sleep with them, shower with them, swim with them. You are them. True, you might be lucky to be on one of the few camps that gives you a day off every week. But the chances are you'll be allowed only to go to some local cockroach motel with no cable and a coked-up manager who charges you and 30 others $20 a head for the privilege of sleeping in one small room with no air-conditioning. A good tip here is to arrange suitable false ID in advance. Even though it's hicksville you won't get served unless you can prove you are 21. One night no fewer than 16 of my fellow counsellors were arrested by bored undercover cops. You do get out of camp sometimes. If you're lucky there'll be a trip to an amusement park or a movie. You might even get to go camping. But make no mistake. You're trapped and there's no way out. But when the day came to say goodbye I didn't want to leave. I wanted to stay in the 90-degree heat, eat huge amounts of barbecue food before writing haiku or making a necklace. I wanted to swim everyday, sail yachts and play soccer. I wanted to continue putting on plays and musicals and running the camp radio station. I wanted... who am I kidding? What I really wanted to do was hit New York and blow my 'earnings' in a three-day orgy of consumerism and alcohol in a desperate attempt to feel closer to what I once thought was civilisation. But even now I still get the odd (usually work/stress-related) wish to return to Indian Head. Somewhere I have a leather bracelet with my name on, made for me by Sam. Sometimes, when I'm feeling like a failure I dig it out. I run my fingers over the rough leather and I smile and I think: 'He just has to be in prison by now.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
