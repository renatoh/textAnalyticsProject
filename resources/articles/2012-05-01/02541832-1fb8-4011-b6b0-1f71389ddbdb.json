Not so much the outrageous sweep of the plans for secret justice as the fact that the responsible minister, Ken Clarke, did not appear to have read it \u2013 still less put his stamp on it. The first line of Mr Clarke's foreword said that government's first duty was \"to keep citizens safe and free\", but overleaf the opening line of the substantive paper buried the freedom bit, describing a principal duty to \"national security\" pure and simple. Revised plans will be published as a bill today. Changes since the initial blueprint only confirm that this was an unedited wishlist from the intelligence agencies. The original plan allowed ministers to bar any evidence from open court, in any civil proceeding. The test that ministers had to apply was the usefully ambiguous one of \"public interest\", whereas the only recourse against them came through judicial review, where the standard is exacting: you have to demonstrate irrationality. It was a sloppy and imbalanced pitch, and was roundly condemned as such by the cross-party joint committee on human rights. The government is now at pains to make various body swerves. Inquests will no longer be affected, and ministers will no longer be able to rule but will instead make an application to a judge, who will then decide. There is an attempt to win additional liberal credentials through a better-late-than-never overhaul of the traditionally supine intelligence and security committee. So far, so unobjectionable. But the remaining elements of the derided green paper are being rushed into legislation, without further consultation. Judges err on the side of deference to the executive where national security is concerned, and will be pressed to throw a veil over evidence which prevents those it concerns from interrogating it. Justice is always the loser when awkward questions cannot be posed. Whitehall justifies the move by pointing to the Guant\u00e1namo detainees it had to compensate, in a case where MI6's anxieties about disclosure constrained the case it could make in open court. But the genesis of the plan goes back further \u2013 to the Binyam Mohamed case. That enraged the agencies by exposing what they knew about the CIA's dalliance with torture. Other rendition cases are shining an unforgiving light on politicians, including the former foreign secretary Jack Straw. Those in power might dearly like to shut this light off, but no liberal should want to help them. The Liberal Democrat leadership, however, has struck out the most objectionable elements of an objectionable package in return for supporting the rest. There are echoes of the NHS reforms, where ameliorative compromise sweetened the bitter substance yet brought nothing but political pain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
