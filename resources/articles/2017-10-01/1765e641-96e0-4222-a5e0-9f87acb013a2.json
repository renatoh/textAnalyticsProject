And, if he is perfectly honest, it is one that he did not see happening for him at Tottenham Hotspur. A Champions League glamour tie at Real Madrid? It seemed like a pipe dream. So much so that Lloris, who joined Spurs from Lyon in 2012 in the hope of continuing his development in the Champions League, had started to consider his future. It was the final months of the 2014\u201115 season \u2013 Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s first in managerial charge \u2013 and the goalkeeper felt further away than ever from Europe\u2019s elite competition. He had been mentioned as a target for Manchester United, among other elite clubs, with Real Madrid seemingly primed to take David de Gea from Old Trafford. In the end only a misfiring fax machine stood in the way of that deal. But the Frenchman stayed put and, as he reflects on Tottenham\u2019s subsequent progress, he can be happy that he did. On the eve of the Group H tie against Real at the Bernab\u00e9u, Lloris projected the sense of excitement as much as anything else. \u201cWe have nothing to lose and all to win,\u201d he said. It was not always the case for him at Tottenham and a quote from Toni Jim\u00e9nez, the club\u2019s goalkeeping coach, resonated loudly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Hugo, there were lots of people who were sleeping here,\u201d Jim\u00e9nez told Monday\u2019s edition of AS. \u201cThey\u2019ve woken up.\u201d Pochettino has referred to Tottenham as a \u201csleeping giant\u201d and he has roused them. Now, he wants to make a statement at one of the grandest venues in world football. His young team have come a long way but Real will help them determine just how far. \u201cThere is always something to prove,\u201d Lloris said. \u201cThe target is to be competitive, enjoy our football, make a great team performance and to show the face of Tottenham. We want to play with our concepts, keep possession, be aggressive and try to be dominant \u2013 even if that will be tough against Real at the Bernab\u00e9u. It\u2019s a big opportunity for us to face one of the biggest clubs in the world and, also, to face the best players.\u201d The cast list is a pulse-quickener, even if there will be no Gareth Bale for Real as the forward, who joined from Tottenham in 2013, is out with a calf injury. Zinedine Zidane, the Real manager, added that he could not \u201ctake it for granted\u201d that Bale would be fit for the return tie at Wembley on 1 November. Lloris, like all French players of his generation, is in awe of Zidane, who he described as a \u201clegend\u201d and an \u201cinspiration\u201d. He also talked about Cristiano Ronaldo, Real\u2019s on-field symbol. He is an inspiration for the new generation; a machine of success,\u201d the goalkeeper said. \u201cHe is a great leader and a great personality, too.\u201d Tottenham boast their own names and none is bigger, at present, than Harry Kane, who has replaced Dele Alli as the Spurs player to be most strongly linked with a move to the Bernab\u00e9u. Unusually, Zidane did little to pour cold water on the issue. On the contrary. He admitted he had not foreseen Kane\u2019s rise to prominence but he now considers him to be \u201cthe complete player\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen in the future,\u201d Zidane said when asked whether the striker may one day play for Real. \u201cHe is a key player for Tottenham, he is very good at everything. What he does is always towards the goal, he attacks space at speed. He is a complete player. He didn\u2019t seem to be but, in the end, he is.\u201d Pochettino was peppered with Kane-related questions at his press conference and the thought occurred that we have been here before \u2013 with Real and Tottenham\u2019s marquee players. Remember the Luka Modric saga? He moved from White Hart Lane to the Bernab\u00e9u in 2012 and the Croat made the point in an interview on Monday that he could not turn Real down. But Modric noted how Tottenham had since made significant strides, referencing their investment in a new training ground and stadium. Could they become a destination club rather than a stepping stone, as Lloris has suggested? \u201cI had grown as much as possible after four seasons at Tottenham and I needed new challenges,\u201d Modric said. \u201cReal were the ideal club for me. When I knew they were interested, I couldn\u2019t think about anything else. Signing for this club helped me move up to the next level.\u201d Tottenham were beaten 4-0 on their last visit to the Bernab\u00e9u in the 2011 Champions League quarter-final first leg \u2013 a tie disfigured by Peter Crouch\u2019s early red card \u2013 but Lloris has a happier memory. He was part of the Lyon team who drew 1-1 at the Bernab\u00e9u in the second leg of the Champions League last-16 tie in 2010 for a 2-1 aggregate victory. His Lyon team would also lose at the Bernab\u00e9u in 2011 and 2012. Tottenham take encouragement from their 100% away record this season while Real have not been at their fluent best. As is always the case, the criticism has not been slow to follow, although Real are past masters at raising themselves when they hear the Champions League anthem. Pochettino has included Danny Rose in his squad for the first team this season while Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is also in line to feature. \u201cWe made it through in 2010 [with Lyon],\u201d Lloris said. \u201cWe have to be solid and believe in ourselves. It is a collective sport and it is possible to make great achievements.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
