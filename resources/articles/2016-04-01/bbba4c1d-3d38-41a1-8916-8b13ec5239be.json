The Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Dele Alli, a highly impressive performer in his first top-flight season, took the Young Player of the Year award. Manchester City\u2019s Izzy Christiansen was named Women\u2019s Player of the Year while Beth Mead, of Sunderland Ladies, won the Women\u2019s Young Player of the Year award. Ryan Giggs, who won both of the major men\u2019s gongs during his playing career, completed a rare hat-trick with the PFA Merit Award. Mahrez has had a stunning campaign with the Foxes, scoring 17 goals and providing 11 assists. The Algerian international\u2019s most recent contribution came with the opening goal in the 4-0 win over Swansea City hours before the awards event, which Leicester\u2019s contingent attended in London via helicopter. Mahrez said his Leicester team-mates deserved to take the plaudits for his success. \u201cAll the credit is for them, seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my manager and the staff. Without them I wouldn\u2019t receive this award and I wouldn\u2019t score. It\u2019s the team spirit. I want to dedicate it to them. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to receive this award, it\u2019s a pleasure. It\u2019s extra special because, if the players vote for me, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve seen I\u2019ve been great this year so I\u2019m happy.\u201d After signing from the French second-tier side Le Havre in January 2014 Mahrez made a steady rather than spectacular start to life in England but featured prominently in Leicester\u2019s escape from relegation last season and began 2015-16 with two goals in the 4-2 victory against Sunderland. Neither player nor club has looked back since, with Leicester now five points from an historic title and Mahrez having shone throughout. Ossie Ardiles, the former Tottenham midfielder, collected Alli\u2019s award on behalf of the 20-year-old \u2013 who did not attend the ceremony at Grosvenor House Hotel due to the proximity of Monday night\u2019s home match against West Bromwich Albion. \u201cThank you Ossie, the Tottenham legend, for receiving this award for me,\u201d Alli said in a video message. \u201cI feel honoured to win such a prestigious award and thank you to my friends, family and all the staff at Tottenham.\u201d Alli\u2019s award came with some mild embarrassment for Tottenham, who had dedicated an article in Monday\u2019s matchday programme to his achievement. The piece appeared to have been leaked online earlier on Sunday, which was hardly the ideal scenario, given that news of the winners is strictly embargoed. Christiansen, the 24-year-old forward, won her first senior England cap last September, scoring on her debut against Estonia. She has been in superb form for her club and the same is true of the prodigious striker Mead, who was the top scorer in Women\u2019s Super League One last season with 12 goals from 14 games. Giggs became the latest Manchester United stalwart to be given the merit award, following in the footsteps of Sir Alex Ferguson, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Bobby Charlton. The honour is given for \u201cmeritorious service to English football\u201d and Giggs, who was named player of the year in 2009 and young player of the year in 1992 and 1993, expressed his delight at completing the clean sweep. \u201cI\u2019m chuffed to have won all three awards. The young player was a long time ago and then the player award was a big surprise,\u201d Giggs said. \u201cThis is the culmination of around 25 years since my debut, so it\u2019s a credit to myself, my team-mates, staff, family and friends. When you win each award you look down the trophy and you see the players who have won it before and you realise what a great accolade it is. \u201cThis is the same. I\u2019ve been here on the nights when people have won it and it\u2019s legends of the game. I\u2019m fortunate to win it and I\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d Now assistant manager to Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford, Giggs said that enjoyment was the key to a playing career that brought up a club record 963 appearances and 64 caps for Wales. \u201cWhat Sir Alex always used to say was enjoy it. It was the last thing he said when you went out and played,\u201d Giggs said. \u201cEverything that comes with that obviously \u2013 improve every day, practise, listen, dedicate yourself \u2013 but most of all enjoy your football. That went for playing when I was 17 until when I was 40. It was a privilege to play at Old Trafford and I tried to enjoy it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
