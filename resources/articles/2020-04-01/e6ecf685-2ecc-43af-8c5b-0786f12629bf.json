Dr Ashley Bloomfield is the director-general of health and the public face of the country\u2019s battle against the disease, alongside prime minister Jacinda Ardern. Since March, Bloomfield has been fronting near-daily televised press conferences and has swiftly become a figure of fascination in a nation that has enjoyed early success in the global fight against coronavirus. Quietly spoken and always impeccably prepared, Bloomfield has impressed with his depth of knowledge and quick recall of statistics and unflappable demeanour. New Zealand writer Anna Connell jokingly changed her Twitter handle to The Ashley Bloomfield Fan Club after repeatedly admiring his cool during press conferences. Overnight, her followers began to grow, and she is now the unofficial leader of the nation\u2019s Bloomfield devotees. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual to have people unifying so positively around one person on Twitter, but it\u2019s really hard to find anyone saying a bad word about him,\u201d Connell said. \u201cI think he just epitomises something quite wholesome; he\u2019s not political, he\u2019s got a neutrality about him. He is a very appealing kind of guy. He\u2019s very calm, and he\u2019s very measured \u2013 and he\u2019s got really nice hair.\u201d Dan Laufer, an expert in crisis communication at Victoria university, says Bloomfield\u2019s public-sector background means he is able to command respect regardless of people\u2019s political affiliations. \u201cBloomfield is widely respected because he is a medical doctor which gives him an enormous amount of credibility in the eyes of the public when communicating information related to Covid-19,\u201d Laufer says. \u201cHis communication style is very effective. Direct, fact-based and consistent.\u201d During the first week of lockdown when Bloomfield was given a Saturday away from work the country\u2019s biggest news website ran a prominent story: \u201cAshley Bloomfield is Finally Having a Day Off\u201d and Corin Dann, host of RNZ\u2019s Morning Report added: \u201cI think the whole country would say this is well-earned.\u201d A petition for Bloomfield to be awarded New Zealander of the year is gaining traction, celebrating the \u201ccompetent, calm, factual and reassuring man\u201d. \u201cDr Ashley Bloomfield may just be doing his job, but I believe he is exceeding at it and what is expected of him in his role,\u201d the petition reads. \u201cHis reassurance during NZ\u2019s time of need is amazing. He communicates effectively but calmly and delivers numbers and stats like no other.\u201d According to the ministry of health, Bloomfield qualified in medicine at the University of Auckland in 1990 and specialised in public health, choosing to focus on non-communicable disease prevention and control. In 2011 he spent a year at the World Health Organization in Geneva, learning many of the skills he is now deploying to manage the outbreak. Although the memes and fandom surrounding Bloomfield have a playful edge \u2013 and offer a fun distraction for many New Zealanders during a tense time \u2013 Connell believes Bloomfield is genuinely providing comfort. \u201cI think he is a figurehead of \u2018keep calm and carry on\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think people knew what they were looking for at this time, but it turned out it was exactly him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
