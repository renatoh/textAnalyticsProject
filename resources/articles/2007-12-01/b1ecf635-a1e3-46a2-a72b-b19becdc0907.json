Try today's deal from the recent Gold Cup final. Love all, dealer East: West North East South Pass 1NT1 Pass 2\u26652 Pass 2\u2660 Pass 3\u26663 Pass 4\u26634 Pass 4\u26654 Pass 4\u26604 Pass 5\u26635 Pass 6\u2666 Pass Pass Pass 1) 15-17 2) Transfer showing spades 3) Natural and forcing to game 4) Cue bid with diamonds agreed as trumps 5) The \"last train\" convention, asking partner to bid the slam with what he considers a suitable hand. East leads \u2665K, and you as North observe that the contract appears to depend on the diamond finesse. It's no crime to bid a slam that requires a finesse with teams scoring - you gain 11 IMPs if it makes, lose 11 IMPs if it fails, provided the opponents stay in game at the other table. You are preparing to win the second trick in your own hand and run \u2666Q when . . . East leads \u26669 to trick two. What now? Surely East would not be so rash as to switch to a diamond away from the king. For all he knows, you don't have the jack, and he risks handing you the contract if West has it. So you go up with \u2666A, drop West's singleton king, and . . . Actually, you don't. You see, at the table, this was the real layout of the diamond suit: North Q864, West J10, East K9, South (dummy) A7532. East, junior international Ben Green, had indeed led \u26669 from K9 doubleton to the second trick. He was hoping that the position was as in the first diagram above, in which case his only chance was to fool declarer into rejecting the diamond finesse. Had that been the true position, his deception would no doubt have succeeded, and he would have been a hero. As it was, declarer, David Bakhshi, had no choice but to shrug and play low from dummy on \u26669, since going up with the ace would leave him with a loser even if West did have the singleton king. The slam was made, and Bakhshi's team proceeded to win the Gold Cup by a wide margin.
