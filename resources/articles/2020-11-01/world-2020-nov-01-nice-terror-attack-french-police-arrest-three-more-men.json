A 29-year-old Tunisian man was arrested on Saturday in Grasse, and two other men aged 63 and 25 were later taken in for questioning from the same address. They join two men aged 33 and 35 picked up on Saturday and a 47-year-old who has been held since Thursday. Police say data from two telephones belonging to the alleged attacker, Brahim Aouissaoui, and CCTV footage suggest he arrived in Nice late on 27 October on a train from Rome, between 24-48 hours before the attack on Thursday morning. He was filmed near the basilica on Wednesday and during the evening phoned his family, who live near Sfax in Tunisia, to say he was in France and would be sleeping rough. At 8.29 on Thursday he entered the Notre Dame de l\u2019Assomption basilica and is accused of carrying out an attack that left the 60-year-old worshipper Nadine Devillers and the church sexton Vincent Loqu\u00e8s, 55, dead and Simone Barreto Silva, 44, with fatal injuries. Silva managed to run out of the basilica and collapsed in a nearby restaurant where she died. As well as the large knife Aouissaoui allegedly used to kill the three, he had two more knives and a Qur\u2019an in a backpack. He was shot several times by police who are still waiting to interview him in hospital where he is recovering from serious injuries. French investigators are working with their counterparts in Italy and Tunisia. It is known Aouissaoui made the crossing from Tunisia to Lampedusa in Italy, arriving on 20 September, and spent a month in Covid-19 quarantine. He was in Bari in southern Italy on 9 October but after he was refused asylum he disappeared. Churches across France were under extra protection on Sunday, All Saints Day, after the country\u2019s security alert was raised to its highest level. Christian Estrosi, the mayor of Nice, was due to attend a ceremony of \u201ccontemplation\u201d on Sunday evening at the Notre Dame basilica. Muslims were present for mass in a number of cities, including Blois and Toulouse, as a mark of respect for the victims of last week\u2019s attack. Lahouary Siali, an imam in Toulouse, said they also wished to \u201creject the jihadis\u201d. \u201cThese people have no spirit or reason and want to make another interpretation [of the Qur\u2019an] that we firmly reject,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cWe have not mandated anyone, and given no power of attorney to anyone to speak on our behalf. In the name of what philosophy, what spirituality have you come to take the lives of innocent people?\u201d A group of young Muslims in Lod\u00e8ve, in the H\u00e9rault west of Montpellier, turned out to symbolically protect their local Saint-Fulcran cathedral after Thursday\u2019s attack, saying they were fed up with being stigmatised and insulted on social media. \u201cWe are French, we were born and have grown up in Lod\u00e8ve, a place where different communities live together. There\u2019s a cathedral and a mosque and never any problems between religions,\u201d said Elyazid, who organised the gathering. The French interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, told La Voix du Nord newspaper on Sunday that Aouissaoui \u201cwas only present on our national territory for a few hours. He\u2019d clearly come to kill. Otherwise how do you explain he had only just arrived and he had several knives? Of course it\u2019s for the anti-terrorist prosecutor to establish how his murderous project was planned, but he clearly didn\u2019t come to obtain papers.\u201d He said France had sent \u201chundreds of extra police\u201d to the Italian border, but added: \u201cUnlike the far right, I don\u2019t wish to see a terrorist in every foreigner.\u201d The recent attacks in France have led to a reported spate of vandalism against mosques in the country. Two people were arrested over the weekend after being caught spraying graffiti on the mosque at Panitin in Seine-Saint-Denis, which has been closed for six months for broadcasting a video criticising Samuel Paty\u2019s course in which he showed pupils caricatures of the prophet Muhammad. Four mosques in Rouen also reported received threatening letters following the Nice attack. Further south in the Dr\u00f4me, a Muslim prayer hall was tagged with crosses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
