There has been rapid progress in developing a powerful tool called genome editing, which has the potential to transform the treatment of genetic conditions by rewriting the DNA code of affected cells. Scientists believe that a debate should be had about the ethics of modifying human embryos, before the science gets ahead of public opinion. Here\u2019s the background to the story. What is genome editing? Genome editing is a powerful procedure that has already been a game-changer in helping scientists to understand the roles of genes in health and diseases. It coopts the natural immune defences of bacteria to create what is often described as \u201cmolecular scissors\u201d. These can cut out, but also replace, strands of DNA with great precision. It is possible to change single letters of the DNA code. Why have the funders issued their statement now? To signal to researchers that they support genome-editing research and are open to the therapies that might follow, once experiments show the procedures are safe and worthwhile. The majority of future therapies would target faulty genes in people\u2019s organs, for example the mutation that causes cystic fibrosis in lung tissue. But genome editing could also be used to modify human sperm, eggs and embryos. How could genome editing help patients? Scientists hope that genome editing will lead to radical new therapies for a range of diseases. One plan is to edit patients\u2019 immune cells to make them attack cancers. Another is to make immune cells resistant to the HIV virus, so that even when it gets into people\u2019s blood, the virus cannot take hold. What about editing embryos? Genome editing of embryos might not help many people, but it could give couples with genetic disorders a chance to have their own genetic children. If a couple know that their children will inherit a life-threatening genetic disease, they can choose to have IVF with a donor egg, or can adopt a child instead. Genome editing would work by correcting faulty genes in embryos before they are implanted. What are other countries doing? In the US, some researchers have voiced concerns that genome editing is so cheap and simple that a maverick scientist could use the procedure to try to modify human embryos and implant them into women. Some want a moratorium on all genome editing research on embryos, while others have simply urged scientists not to modify embryos for clinical uses. The overwhelming view of scientists is that the procedure is too new to know how safe it is. A major concern is a public backlash could impact on the race to develop new and safe therapies. Is it legal? UK law prohibits genetically modified embryos from being implanted into women, but embryos can be altered in research labs under licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. They must be destroyed after 14 days. Research on embryos is more tightly controlled in many other European countries. In the US, there is no law banning genome editing of embryos, but the government\u2019s National Institutes of Health (NIH) will not fund any use of gene editing technologies in human embryos. The NIH views any editing of the human germline as \u201ca line that should not be crossed\u201d. What do the UK funders want? Beyond supporting scientists who work on genome editing, the funders want a national debate on whether the genome editing of human sperm, eggs and embryos should ever be allowed. Are there any circumstances where there is an ethical case for modifying human embryos, or do concerns about introducing DNA changes to future generations always trump the benefits?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
