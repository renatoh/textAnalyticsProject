Their only notable victory in the last year came when they were awarded an Ashes Test in 2009, a decision which was not received rapturously in the Welsh county because of the financial constraints the redevelopment of Sophia Gardens would place on squad rebuilding. The contrast with Nottinghamshire yesterday could not have been more stark: it was not just top against bottom, an unbeaten side against one searching for its first victory, but Glamorgan fielded three teenagers and no overseas players while their opponents rippled with experience, boasted David Hussey and Stephen Fleming and had won the first match between the sides last month by an innings. Glamorgan's plight was summed up an hour before the start when their Australian opening batsman Jimmy Maher suffered a groin strain warming up. Richard Grant, on his 23rd birthday, was summoned from a second-team match in Bristol and by the time he arrived half-an-hour into the first session, his side were two wickets down having won the toss and opted to bat on a dry, flat surface. Glamorgan were without six injured players before Maher's mishap while their England pace bowler Simon Jones had been ordered by the national management to rest, despite bowling only 10 overs in the past two weeks. His absence left Glamorgan with two seam bowlers, one of them 17-year old James Harris, who provided the highlight of the day for the home supporters when he added an unbeaten 88 for the ninth-wicket with Robert Croft to frustrate the leaders. Otherwise it had been Nottinghamshire's day from the second ball of the morning, a half-volley from Charlie Shreck which Gareth Rees chipped into the hands of Chris Franks at mid-on. Wickets fell steadily and runs were garnered slowly even though Notts did not bowl with particular menace. The Glamorgan captain David Hemp patiently crafted a half- century, Grant even more slowly ground out 41 and the passivity of the batting betrayed the side's lowly position until Harris, joining Croft at 193 for eight and unburdened by accumulated failure, brought a jaunt to the innings and, with his partner, who during his first 50 of the season reached 10,000 runs for Glamorgan, put some bark into the underdog."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
