Jonny Howson suggested that Newcastle United and Sunderland, Norwich City\u2019s next two visitors, are not too big to go down as the smallest club involved in the battle to avoid the drop showed a little unity can go a long way. Robbie Brady\u2019s goal and a first clean sheet on the road this season enabled Alex Neil\u2019s side to climb out of the relegation zone before Sunday\u2019s Tyne-Wear derby and increase the pressure on the north-east giants who visit Carrow Road either side of Norwich\u2019s trip to Crystal Palace next month. No one would claim Norwich are immune to relegation nerves, and a run of two points from 10 games before Saturday\u2019s victory reflected a squad thin on the quality required to avoid repeating their demotion of two years ago. But, taking their lead from the classy centre-back Timm Klose, signed for \u00a38m from Wolfsburg in January, back-to-back clean sheets have left them two points above the relegation zone and relishing a run of three games that will shape their destiny. Perhaps Newcastle and Sunderland, like doomed Aston Villa, have got more to lose than Norwich, because of the clubs\u2019 relative statures, a situation that alleviates the burden on last year\u2019s Championship play-off winners. \u201cWe can\u2019t change what people\u2019s thoughts are or what their predictions are,\u201d Howson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it happen over the years when the bigger clubs have gone down and sometimes the smaller teams stay up. It\u2019s not something we\u2019ll think about.\u201d The midfielder was influential in this first away win since December as Norwich sang off the same tactical hymn sheet, did not overplay in front of Albion\u2019s compact defensive unit and showed they are not afraid to compete physically. Brady was a case in point as he followed his opportunist finish, anticipating the loose ball to score after Matt Jarvis bungled his initial effort, by hurting his neck and shoulder in a collision with Craig Dawson and having to leave the field with blurred vision. \u201cRobbie has had a few whacks in recent weeks,\u201d said Howson, who started the move for the goal. \u201cBits of his teeth knocked out the other week, he injured his calf, then this \u2026 He\u2019s been in the wars. But on the other hand I\u2019m sure he\u2019s over the moon getting the winner for us. When you\u2019re in this situation, at this time of the season, you\u2019ve got to put your head in where it hurts.\u201d Carrow Road will not be a place for the faint-hearted when Newcastle and Sunderland come to town after the international break. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously two massive games,\u201d Howson said, \u201cbut from now until the end of the season show me any games that aren\u2019t massive.\u201d The trip to Selhurst Park also offers Norwich hope as Palace have failed to win in 13 league games, their buffer from the bottom four now whittled down to five points. This time two years ago, Norwich gained just one point from their final seven games to be overtaken for the final survival place by West Brom, a precedent not missed by Neil, who recently invited his players to have their say in agreeing the team\u2019s tactics for the run-in. \u201cFive points above the relegation zone with seven games to play \u2026 sometimes you can feel as if it\u2019s going swimmingly and suddenly find yourself in trouble,\u201d the Norwich managed mused. \u201cTrying to reverse that is extremely difficult. Palace will be concerned about that and we\u2019ve got them to play.\u201d Man of the match Timm Klose (Norwich)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
