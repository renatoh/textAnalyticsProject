Jones struck with a curler into the top corner from outside the area in the 71st minute to give Liverpool a 1-0 win \u2013 it was the 18-year-old\u2019s first senior goal \u2013 and he admitted that it was overwhelming. \u201cI dream of a lot of things but this one was ahead of a dream,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI can\u2019t sum up my emotions. There are world-class players all over this team but I think I went out and showed what I could do. The ball came to me and I only had one thing in mind \u2013 to shoot. It\u2019s massive for me and the rest of the young boys. At times it\u2019s frustrating thinking you might get a chance but then having to sit on the bench and watch.\u201d Klopp did not want to talk up Jones ahead of the many other youngsters who impressed, among them Neco Williams, Pedro Chirivella and the substitute Yasser Larouci. But he did suggest that Jones\u2019s future lay as a Liverpool first-team player. \u201cHe\u2019s an unbelievable player,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cA scouser, very confident, can\u2019t wait to play in the first team. He has made big steps. He will be a Liverpool player if nothing strange happens, 100%. In Germany, because of a different system, he would play 100% another year in the youth team and nowhere else. Here he is around the first team.\u201d Klopp was annoyed to lose one of the few established players he used \u2013 James Milner \u2013 to a hamstring injury but he described the rest of the occasion as \u201cabsolutely perfect.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s very important we give the boys this opportunity. I tell them in training that it\u2019s important not all of them, in their first impulse, go out on loan. There is something to learn here, as well. We saw these boys come closer and closer to being ready to play for us.\u201d A full-strength Everton team missed chances in the first half and were dreadful after the break. \u201cIt was not good,\u201d Carlo Ancelotti, the manager, said. \u201cI will speak with them and tell them that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
