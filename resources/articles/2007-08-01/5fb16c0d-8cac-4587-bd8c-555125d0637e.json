A difficult afternoon for the French was made worse by news that their key stand-off Casey McGuire is almost certainly ruled out of the cup final with St Helens in three weeks' time. McGuire sustained a pectoral injury that will require a scan this week but the Catalans coach, Mick Potter, is sceptical about his chances of playing at Wembley. \"It doesn't look good,\" Potter admitted. \"We could be looking at anything from four weeks until the end of the season. I don't think he'll play in the final.\" The French, so impressive in triumphing in the cup semi-final against Wigan seven days earlier, never looked like repeating those heroics. On a sweltering afternoon that should have suited the Perpignan side the Dragons could not deal with Huddersfield's pace and cutting edge out wide, particularly in the first half, when the Giants' three-quarters Shane Elford and Rod Jensen impressed. With the loose forward Stephen Wild adding a double of his own, Jon Sharp's team climbed back into the play-off places with five games remaining. \"We spoke about starting well, particularly after their tough game in the semi-final,\" Sharp said. \"We felt we needed to get out of the blocks quickly and we certainly did that.\" Catalans may be preparing for their historic cup final appearance but they will also be keen to avoid bottom place in Super League for a second consecutive year, despite their immunity from relegation. The concession of three tries in the opening quarter was central to this defeat, along with two yellow cards to their fullback Clint Greenshields, forcing them to play for 20 minutes with 12 men. \"I think the guys maybe thought they could find an easy way to win,\" said Potter, whose side has now won only one of their last eight Super League games. \"This just shows you can't do that against any team in Super League. Give Huddersfield credit, though. I thought they played pretty well.\" Catalans were behind after less than four minutes through an outstanding try from the Huddersfield winger Jensen. He collected a McGuire high kick deep inside his own half and won the 80-metre race to the opposite end of the field. Moments later Darrell Griffin ploughed over by the posts to make it 12-0. The Dragons did respond with a superbly worked score from the veteran forward Jason Croker, who finished off smart play from McGuire, Stacey Jones and Greenshields. But Huddersfield hit back immediately as Jensen broke clear to send Elford sprinting over and the visitors' hopes were soon dealt a further blow when Greenshields was sin-binned for interference. The Giants took advantage, with Wild slicing over for his first try, and just as Greenshields returned, the home side scored again to make it 28-6 at half-time. Steve Snitch's offload released Robbie Paul inside his own half and Elford again supported for his second try. When Wild completed his own double 90 seconds after the restart, the French were in danger of being on the end of a huge scoreline. But suddenly the Dragons stirred, crossing twice inside four minutes through Alex Chan and Adam Mogg. Huddersfield respected the mini-comeback enough for Chris Thorman to slot a penalty, before Greenshields' second yellow card ended the French resistance. Thorman and Younes Khattabi traded tries in the closing stages but Dragons' thoughts will now turn to McGuire's scan. Huddersfield Giants Thorman; Jensen, Nero, Elford, Gardner; Brown, Paul; Mason, Hudson, Griffin, Lolesi, Raleigh, Wild. Interchange Crabtree, Drew, Skandalis, Snitch. Catalans Dragons Greenshields; Khattabi, Wilson, Mogg, Duport; McGuire, Jones; Chan, Quigley, Guisset, Raguin, Croker, Mounis. Interchange Griffi, Gossard, Ferriol, Touxagas.
