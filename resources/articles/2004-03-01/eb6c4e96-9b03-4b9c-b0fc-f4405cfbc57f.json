Cheltenham 2003 was a disaster for the bookmakers, both on and off the course. Favourite after favourite was led back through great crowds of punters, who by the end of it all were cheering as much in disbelief as joy. There was but one thought to console the layers as they added up the losses. It couldn't happen again. Or could it? The names that the bookmakers fear this year are, for the most part, the same horses that did them such terrible damage 12 months ago. Best Mate, Moscow Flyer and Baracouda will all start at, or very close to, odds-on to repeat their victories in the Gold Cup, Queen Mother Champion Chase and Stayers' Hurdle respectively. Add Rooster Booster to the punters' wish-list at around 7-4 in the Champion Hurdle, and you have a four-horse accumulator that could bring the layers to their knees for the second year running. \"If all four of them go in, then they'll be carrying us out on our shields,\" Freddie Williams, probably the most fearless layer in the Cheltenham ring, says. \"I've got some betting shops too, and I was laying the four-timer at 40-1 before Christmas. Now it's only 12-1. But I really can't see it happening again. I'm thinking that we can beat three out of the four.\" Some other bookies are approaching the meeting with a gleam in their eye. Paul Gold, who bets under the banner of Pickwick Racing, took his share of the punishment last year but he is convinced that 2003 was a freak Festival. \"As a bookmaker, you have to be an optimist,\" Gold says. \"Last year, almost half of the favourites won, whereas normally you'd expect their strike-rate to be around 14 to 16%.\" The two men take different approaches to the business of making Cheltenham pay. Williams is a keen form student who will often keep a horse that he fancies on his side. Gold, though, is strictly a numbers man. \"I just bet to figures,\" he says. \"I'll take up to my limit on the favourite, and then adjust the prices on the others so that in an ideal situation, I'll have the favourite to lose, the second-favourite to finish level, and everything else wins for me. \"If you can go from race to race not losing too much, and then suddenly get a lot of money, you'll get it all back.\" The blows were unrelenting last year, even in the handicaps. Inching Closer, the 6-1 favourite, won the last race on the first day by no more than a flared nostril, while an immense gamble on Xenophon in the Coral Cup was landed with ease. \"The worst results of all are when favourites go in at 4-1 or 5-1 because people are not putting on so much money,\" Gold says. \"It's not like the 11-8 and even-money chances, you've only got to get one of those beat and you've got all your money back.\" Both Gold and Williams are hopeful of getting an early result in the Champion Hurdle. \"There's a school of thought that says Rooster Booster may have left the race behind [in the Tote Gold Trophy] at Newbury,\" Gold says. Williams, meanwhile, is pinning his hopes on Azertyuiop turning over Moscow Flyer, and expects a big run from Iris's Gift in the Stayers' Hurdle. If the punters pick up where they left off last year, though, Williams in particular will be staring into a very deep pit by the time Best Mate enters the paddock before the Gold Cup. It will be time to decide whether to cut his losses, or take the favourite on in an attempt to get it all back. \"I try to work out what I'm going to do at the start of every day,\" he says, \"but you wouldn't be human if you weren't affected by results. If we get to that point, I'll have a think about it and work out what to do.\" And the difference between a good and bad week if you are Freddie Williams? He doesn't hesitate. \"A million,\" he says. \"Either way.\" Bookies' biggest losers: Azertyuiop (Arkle Trophy): the 5-4 chance never looked in any danger and took almost \u00a3300,000 from the ring in recorded bets alone. Inching Closer (Pertemps Final): the 6-1 favourite beat Royal Emperor by a short-head. Moscow Flyer (Champion Chase): almost a one-horse book and bets included \u00a350,000 to win \u00a3125,000. Xenophon (Coral Cup): backed down from 20-1 ante-post, and from 8-1 to 4-1 on the course. Baracouda (Stayers' Hurdle): the 9-4 joint-favourite held off Iris's Gift to land more big bets. Best Mate (Gold Cup): final, crippling blow as punters played up winnings. Backed to take more than \u00a3500,000 out of the ring, including \u00a3100,000 to win \u00a3150,000. Horses they fear now: Rooster Booster (Champion Hurdle): with no ante-post liabilities, so they will be tempted to lay him at around 7-4. If he is in the same form as last year, though, he will surely make them pay. Moscow Flyer (Champion Chase): with Azertyuiop close behind him in the market, it is effectively around a 1-9 chance that one of the two will win. That will leave the bookies, unusually, cheering for a 6-4 shot. Martinstown (Champion Bumper): has all the makings of a spectacular gamble. Baracouda (Stayers' Hurdle): third consecutive victory in this race will simply provide punters with even more cash to lump on ... Best Mate (Gold Cup): even odds of 1-2 will not deter the serious punters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
