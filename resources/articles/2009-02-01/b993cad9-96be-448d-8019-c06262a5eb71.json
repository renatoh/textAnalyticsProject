This was the consensus in the crowded session on bobbies and civil liberties at today's Convention on Modern Liberty. In a healthy relationship between the government and the police, the former should interfere with the latter on the big issues \u2013 namely, to safeguard certain core values, to demand that evidence rather than suspicion leads to intervention, to uphold the right to privacy, and to insure there are mechanisms of accountability in place for those who are mistreated in the name of security. The smaller issues, on the other hand, should be left to the experts in policing \u2013 the police themselves. The problem is that the government is failing to intervene in the big issues, and micro-managing the small ones. Fundamental civil liberties are being eroded by police behaviour, and the government is complicit in this erosion. Malcolm Carroll of Plane Stupid talked about how non-violent protesters are being forcibly stopped and searched by \"political policing\" that rests on excuses as feeble as \"you were carrying blue string\" or \"you were standing whilst others were moving\". He went on to explain how the recent decision to make photographing the police an offence erodes protesters' fundamental ability to hold the police accountable for these abuses of power. Steve Powell, director of policy at the Football Supporters' Federation, talked about how Section 27 of the Crime Reduction Act led to football fans having an innocent pre-match drink being rounded onto a security bus, forcing them to miss their match and leaving the bemused pub owner wondering why his cheery, harmless customers were being deported from his establishment. Yasmin Khan of the Jean Charles de Menezes Campaign talked about how policies such as shoot to kill are being made behind closed doors by police officers and civil servants without public consultation. If the police start taking these actions or demanding their right to take them, then it is the government's duty to interfere. But it doesn't do this. Instead, it gives our fundamental rights away, and interferes with the micro-management of the police instead. Harriet Seargent from the Centre of Policy Studies, who has been interviewing members of the police around the country, talked about how the creeping government interference in day to day policing is corroding rank and file police officers' ability to deliver the services the public want. Because police are judged by the number of arrests they make, the prevention of crime falls off officers' radars. Because you get the same number of \"points\" for sanctioning a kid who has stolen a Mars Bar as you do for capturing a murderer, you encourage the police to focus on minor crimes. Police used to be about problem solving; now it is about how many people they lock up. The police have lost their discretion, and with it they have lost public trust. A member of the audience pointed out that the relationship between the police and the government has always adversely affected certain groups: the working class, miners on strike, black and ethnic minority people. It's only now that this relationship has started to affect the middle classes that we've started paying attention. There is a consensus that this corrosive relationship between the government and the police is now affecting everyone. To get it back on track, the government needs to stop micro-managing, and focus its efforts on safeguarding the bigger rights at stake. \u2022 See more on the convention and civil liberties at liberty central"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
