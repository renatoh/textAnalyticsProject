Middlesbrough had agreed a deal with Spanish club Celta Vigo to take the 23-year-old international forward on loan until the end of the season with a view to a permanent move. They were hoping that the initial - and fully expected - decision of the Department of Employment to turn down the \u00a310m-rated player's application for a work permit because he had not played in 75% of his country's games during the previous two years would be overturned on appeal. But where they had previously been successful with the Brazilian midfielder Juninho and the Croatian striker Alen Boksic, this time they failed despite a letter from the South African Football Association backing their bid. \"I am hugely disappointed and very surprised that our appeal has been turned down,\" said McClaren, who had returned to work yesterday morning refreshed after his side picked up their second three-point haul in three days with their 2-1 victory over Leicester on Monday night. \"I strongly believe Benni would have been a very worthy addition to the Premier League and would have been an excellent acquisition for Middlesbrough. Although he hadn't played the required 75% of competitive internationals over the past two years, we felt we had a very good case. \"We received a strong letter from the South African FA explaining that he would have played for them on many more occasions but Benni had 'retired' from the national team for a spell as he was concentrating on his club career.\" The decision sends McClaren back to the drawing board in his quest to find the goals which will help his side climb the Premiership table. The former Ajax striker McCarthy had been his No1 target, and with Boksic still struggling to overcome the calf injury which has kept him out since the opening-day defeat by Arsenal, reinforcements cannot arrive quickly enough. The Nottingham Forest midfielder Andy Johnson has completed a \u00a3200,000 move to their First Division rivals West Brom. The Wales international had a medical at the Hawthorns yesterday and has agreed a three-year contract. Johnson, whose contract at Forest was due to expire next summer, failed to make an impression at the City Ground this season following the appointment of Paul Hart as manager. The 27-year-old found himself at odds with Hart last month when he refused to line up as a substitute for Forest's game against Sheffield United on the opening day of the season. Sheffield United's manager Neil Warnock hopes to persuade Paul Devlin to stay, even though the winger is poised to hand in a transfer request."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
