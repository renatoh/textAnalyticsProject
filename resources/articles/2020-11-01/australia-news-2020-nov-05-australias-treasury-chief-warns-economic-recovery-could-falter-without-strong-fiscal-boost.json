In a speech on Thursday, the Treasury secretary called on the government to consider lowering the threshold for fiscal intervention, so it could spend to boost the economy whenever it is flagging, not just after a \u201clarge shock\u201d. Kennedy credited the government with already providing $257bn in \u201cdirect economic support\u201d totalling 13% of 2019-20 GDP. But he noted that after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut the official cash rate to 0.1% on Tuesday there was no further room to boost the economy using conventional monetary policy. The reserve bank also opted to buy $100bn of government bonds from banks over the next six months by printing money in a quantitative easing program. Kennedy told Australian Business Economists on Thursday that states and territories \u201ccan also play an important role in supporting the economic recovery\u201d by spending more on social and other infrastructure. He said the federal budget had \u201cused a wide range of levers and incentives to support aggregate demand\u201d including income tax cuts, business tax concessions and infrastructure spending. The government had also allowed extra welfare payments and lower tax receipts to boost the economy rather than cut back to shrink the $281bn deterioration in the underlying cash balance, Kennedy said. But \u201cgiven the lack of conventional monetary support available, the recovery could falter without a strong fiscal policy response leading to years of anaemic growth\u201d, he warned. \u201cMore and more unemployment would become entrenched reducing the productive capacity of the economy. Lower growth also means that inflation and wages would likely remain lower for longer.\u201d In October, Australia\u2019s unemployment rate hit 6.9% \u2013 outperforming expectations \u2013 although there are early warning signs that cuts to jobkeeper wage subsidies at the end of September hurt wages and will result in more job losses. According to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released on Wednesday, retail trade was down 1.1% in September, and payroll jobs decreased by 0.8% from 3-17 October. Kennedy argued that there was \u201cless space\u201d for monetary policy to work before it reached the lower bound because the \u201cneutral or natural interest rate\u201d had been steadily falling for 40 years. This raised \u201cfundamental issues\u201d about when governments should step in to help reserve banks boost the economy. \u201cFiscal policy has always responded to large shocks but there is now a question about whether the threshold for intervention should be lowered.\u201d Although monetary policy was favoured as the quickest option, the Treasury is now able to use real-time data and is working to speed up its processes to provide \u201cmore up-to-date assessments of the appropriate stance of fiscal policy\u201d. \u201cAny move towards more active fiscal policy needs to be pinned to credible long-run anchors,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cIn the case of Australia, this is achieved through a continued commitment to sound public finances, underpinned by the tax to GDP cap, balanced budgets and stabilising and reducing debt in the longer-term.\u201d The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, responded to the speech by calling for a \u201ccomprehensive economic plan for recovery\u201d to prevent the only lasting legacy of the recession being \u201ca trillion dollars of debt and higher unemployment for longer\u201d. \u201cThe reserve bank has been forced to enact extreme measures to support Australians and the economy in the face of a government which has not done enough to prevent the jobs crisis worsening,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
