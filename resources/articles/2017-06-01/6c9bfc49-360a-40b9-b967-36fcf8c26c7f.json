Yet some argue that things are not what they seem. They say that none of the fish sold at the restaurants or caf\u00e9s offering \u201cfresh local fish\u201d is caught by the town\u2019s fishermen. Instead it is brought in by van from wholesalers in Newlyn, 15 miles away. And of the boats bobbing in the water, only three are commercial fishing boats. Of those, one fisherman is retiring this year and the other two are ready to call it a day. \u201cSee all this?\u201d says David Toy, pausing as he loads boxes on to his boat to gesture at the bustling harbour. \u201cIt\u2019s all a lie. It\u2019s like Disneyland. Look around here \u2013 all these restaurants, none of them take our fish. Good luck to them. I don\u2019t depend on them for my livelihood, none of them. I sell my fish. I\u2019ve got a van and I sell it at market.\u201d As with many rural and coastal communities, Porthleven is struggling to adapt to the challenges posed by a booming tourist sector: money comes in from outside, pushing prices up, forcing the locals out, second homes proliferate and the traditional activities that define a place become little more than window-dressing. Meanwhile that tourist money doesn\u2019t filter down to the local community. \u201cThat\u2019s the downfall of Cornwall,\u201d says Gary Eastwell, emerging from one of the other fishing boats. \u201cI was born here, but I can\u2019t afford to live here. It would make our lives a lot better if they would buy our fish from us, but none of them do. The people who come here think they\u2019re eating fish caught here, but they\u2019re not. Why would you put road miles on a lobster?\u201d The tensions are not unique to Porthleven. Around the country fishing communities are facing the pressures of adapting to a new economy. In Worthing in West Sussex, which has one remaining fisher, a social enterprise has set up the Last Fisherman Standing project to celebrate and protect the heritage of the industry in the town. It has also started a project, Catchbox, to help fishers sell their fish locally. The Northumberland seafood centre in Amble is another project that aims to boost tourism and support the fishing industry. Similar initiatives have taken place from Fleetwood in Lancashire to Sidmouth in Devon, where commercial fishing has ceased. \u201cHeritage has been commodified,\u201d says Chris Balch, professor of planning at Plymouth University. \u201cWe go to mining communities that don\u2019t mine. We go for the nostalgia \u2013 a nostalgia for these places that haven\u2019t really existed for a very long time. It\u2019s the nature of the changing economic base of the rural economy. Global forces push these places to the edge even more. \u201cThe truly rural place hardly exists any longer. It\u2019s all connected to an urban base, and that\u2019s the change these rural economies are confronting. The raison d\u2019\u00eatre and the demographics have changed. It\u2019s very difficult to cope with. Every place is managing that change, but it becomes much more obvious in a small rural community.\u201d In many coastal communities, locals have been encouraged to take matters into their own hands, developing economic plans and deciding for themselves how they want a community to develop. Tim Acott of the Greenwich Maritime Centre points to the example of Hastings, where the Fishermen\u2019s Protection Society has drawn attention to the work of fishers in the town and their cultural and economic contribution. \u201cHastings has the largest beach-landed fleet in Britain,\u201d he says, \u201cand the community has pushed above its weight in protecting fishing as part of its cultural heritage. There are places where the fisher communities are still thriving, but there are also places in the UK where you could call it a besieged industry.\u201d Last year the New Economics Foundation launched its Blue New Deal, aiming to identify and address the problems afflicting coastal communities. \u201cWe need a new approach to the development of coastal areas,\u201d says the foundation\u2019s Fernanda Balata. \u201cOne that puts local people in control. We need to think about places in the round and consider how all the different parts of a town\u2019s coastal economy can work together. If nothing is done, the small-scale fishing industry will die out. We can see the impact of that in inequality and how these communities come to feel left behind, and the social and political problems that follow from that.\u201d Manda Brookman of the Cornwall-based pressure group Coast sees the same problems. \u201cWe need to ask if tourism is there for the destination or if the destination is there for tourism,\u201d she says. \u201cTourism should be irrigating the community, not extracting from it. Some of these places have ended up becoming a pastiche \u2013 it\u2019s the prostitution of place. Good tourism should be making sure that there are social, environmental and economic benefits. If not, then you need to be asking if you should be doing tourism at all.\u201d Rick Stein\u2019s spokesman has told the Guardian that his fish came from the area, and that customers received the same quality fish whether they were in Padstow, Porthleven or Barnes in London. He added that this model meant the business could be sure the fish it was serving came from sustainable sources."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
