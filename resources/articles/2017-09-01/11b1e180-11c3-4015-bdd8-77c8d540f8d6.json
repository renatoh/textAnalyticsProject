The burgeoning friendship between a pair of literary stars, Charles Dickens and Hans Christian Andersen, had looked set to last. But it could not survive an overlong stay by the Danish author at the British novelist\u2019s family home in Kent. Just how bad things became, on one side at least, has been revealed by a surprisingly frank letter sold at auction on Saturday. In March 1857, Andersen had announced he was coming over for a short summer stay of a fortnight at the most. Andersen wrote: \u201c[M]y visit is intended for you alone,\u201d and added, \u201cAbove all, always leave me a small corner in your heart.\u201d By the time Andersen\u2019s visit had come to an end, after a full five weeks, Dickens felt compelled to confide to the former prime minister Lord John Russell that the creator of some of the world\u2019s best-loved fairytales was a bad house guest. \u201cHe spoke French like Peter the Wild Boy and English like the Deaf and Dumb School,\u201d complained the great author, making a cruel reference to the well-known story of a feral German boy \u201cPeter\u201d, an ungainly court favourite in Georgian England. And, according to the reluctant host, Andersen was no better in any other language. \u201cHe could not pronounce the name of his own book The Improvisatore, in Italian; and his translatress appears to make out that he can\u2019t speak Danish,\u201d Dickens wrote. The remarkable letter, which fetched \u00a34,600 and is to stay in London, is just one in an extraordinary trove of correspondence, images and autographs sold by the Suffolk auction house Lacy Scott &amp; Knight on Saturday. The rare documents, including an album sold to an American telephone bidder for \u00a316,000 that contains a scrap of Jane Austen\u2019s handwriting, are all part of a Scottish family collection handed down the generations. There were also letters from Queen Victoria, William Gladstone, Charles Darwin and Sir Walter Scott. \u201cThere is a huge range here, from political figures, to authors and royalty and the provenance of all the lots is excellent,\u201d said Guy Pratt, a book expert and consultant for the auctioneers. \u201cThe original collector was well-connected.\u201d Guests, it is sometimes said, like fish, go bad after three days. Andersen\u2019s five weeks with Dickens was clearly pushing it. The famous writers first met in the summer of 1847 at an aristocratic soiree where Andersen had told Dickens he was a big fan, calling him \u201cthe greatest writer of our time\u201d. Some of the Danish tales had just been translated into English and so Andersen was on what might now be described as a promotional tour. In a letter back to friends, Andersen gushed that Dickens \u201cquite answers to the best ideas I had formed of him\u201d. A couple of weeks later Dickens, one of the most celebrated names in London, left a package containing a note and presentation copies of a dozen of his books at Andersen\u2019s lodgings. On his return to Denmark, Andersen, noted for his social awkwardness, appears to have become a little obsessed with the dashing English author. For nine years he sent him regular fan letters, along with books for review. When the Dane came to stay in July 1857, it was not during a good time for Dickens, who was considering leaving his wife. His serialisation of Little Dorrit had not gone down well either and he was also feverishly rehearsing his acting role in Wilkie Collins\u2019 The Frozen Deep. For his part, Andersen found Gad\u2019s Hill, in Higham, Dickens\u2019s country home, too cold, a biographer has noted. And he was also upset that no one was available to shave him in the morning. Soon his mood swings also became a problem. He lay down on the lawn and wept after receiving a bad review and then cried again when he finally left Gad\u2019s Hill on 15 July. Dickens was less glum on his guest\u2019s departure, writing on the mirror in the guest room: \u201cHans Andersen slept in this room for five weeks \u2014 which seemed to the family AGES!\u201d The author is already known to have written to his friend William Jerdan six days later complaining about Andersen\u2019s oddness. \u201cWhenever he got to London, he got into wild entanglements of Cabs and Sherry, and never seemed to get out of them again until he came back here, and cut out paper into all sorts of patterns, and gathered the strangest little nosegays in the woods,\u201d he wrote. The correspondence between the pair died out soon afterwards. But the brief relationship may not have proved entirely fruitless. Some scholars have suggested that Andersen, later described by Dickens\u2019s daughter Kate as \u201ca bony bore\u201d, could have inspired the character of the toadying Uriah Heep in David Copperfield. Oscar Wilde vs George Meredith Wilde attacked Meredith\u2019s style in an essay, The Decay of Living, saying he had \u201cmastered everything except language; as a novelist, he can do everything except tell a story; as an artist, he is everything except articulate.\u201d Mary McCarthy vs Lillian Hellman Asked on TV in 1980 which writers were overated the critic McCarthy said playwright Hellman was \u201ca bad writer, a dishonest writer, but she really belongs to the past,\u201d adding, \u201cevery word she writes is a lie, including \u2018and\u2019 and \u2018the.\u2019\u201d An unresolved lawsuit followed. Gore Vidal vs Truman Capote Though former friends, Vidal claimed to have sat on Capote at a party, mistaking him for a stool, while Capote falsely said Vidal had been ejected from the White House for being rude to Jackie Kennedy\u2019s mother. \u201cI\u2019m always sad about Gore\u2014very sad that he has to breathe every day,\u201d Capote said later. On Capote\u2019s death Vidal said: \u201cCapote I truly loathed. The way you might loathe an animal. A filthy animal that has found its way into the house.\u201d Mario Vargas Llosa vs Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez Close friends before 1976, they were not on speakers for 31 years after Vargas Llosa punched Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez in the eye on the red carpet at a Mexico City film premiere. Vargas Llosa was rumoured to be angry that his wife had turned to Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez for \u201cconsolation\u201d after he cheated on her. Germaine Greer vs David Plante Greer shared a house with American novelist David Plante in 1982 while he wrote his book, Difficult Women, about Jean Rhys, Sonia Orwell and, secretly, also about Greer. She refused to read it, saying: \u201cHe had no idea how deeply I would resent being made to utter namby-pamby Plante-speak like a dummy on his knee.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
