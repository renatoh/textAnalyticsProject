Despite Quins' poor form this season the 28-year-old Burke, who has won 11 caps, has played consistently well and without his 241 points the club's predicament would be far darker. Paul Wallace, who played in all three Tests for the 1997 Lions, is also back in favour and the Munster lock Paul O'Connell and the Leinster flanker Keith Gleeson have been included in the 43-strong squad but otherwise the Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan, who took over last month from Warren Gatland, has resisted any temptation to make wholesale changes. England may be forced to call two uncapped players into their squad for their opening Six Nations match against Scotland. The Northampton scrum-half Matt Dawson is sidelined with an ankle injury and Austin Healey may miss the match through suspension so the manager Clive Woodward will bring in untried players, with Saracens' Nick Walshe, Newcastle's Hall Charlton and Leicester's Harry Ellis the names in the frame. The France wing Christophe Dominici will not play any part in the Six Nations after surgery yesterday to repair the shoulder he injured during Stade Fran\u00e7ais's Heineken Cup match with Treviso over the weekend. He will be out of action for at least three months. The Scottish Rugby Union is waiting for the former All Black assistant coach Tony Gilbert to say whether he is prepared to take up the position of head coach of Border, the new professional team which will be in operation at the start of next season. Gilbert is under contract until the summer with the New Zealand Rugby Football Union. Pontypridd's match against Overmach Parma at Gloucester's Kingsholm ground, which was due to have been played tonight, has been put back to tomorrow because of travel difficulties for the Italians.
