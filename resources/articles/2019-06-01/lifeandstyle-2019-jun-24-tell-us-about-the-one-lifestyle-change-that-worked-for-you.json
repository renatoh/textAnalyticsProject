Over the past few months, writers have been describing their experiences of the one change that worked for them, as part of a weekly series. We have heard stories of overcoming addiction, rediscovering faith, ending an engagement, exercising less, going out more. Now, it is over to you. If you have a story you would like to share \u2013 this could be something dramatic like giving up drinking, becoming a vegan or taking up a new exercise regime, or it could be something much more subtle which led to a big change \u2013 we want to hear from you. Share your experiences To tell us about the change that worked for you, fill out the form below with some small details about you and the change that you would like to write about.
