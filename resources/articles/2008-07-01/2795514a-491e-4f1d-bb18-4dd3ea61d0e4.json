The final offence is the pervasive sentimentality . . . This might be pardoned as commonplace claptrap. But to identify the hunt for paedophiles as the essential 'battle between good and evil' and Nazi killers as 'a giant child-abuse ring' is something more. Such crassly righteous moral confusion belongs in a tabloid editorial rather than in a novel for grown-ups.\" \"Challenging established narratives is what Martin Pugh does best,\" declared Frances Wilson in the Daily Telegraph, reviewing \"We Danced All Night\": A Social History of Britain Between the Wars. \"He describes a time not just of hunger marches, class conflict and mass unemployment, but of rising incomes, improved diets, holidays, motoring, aviation, leisure activities and suburban comforts.\" \"By comparison with David Kynaston's recent book on the immediate postwar period there is surprisingly little on the world of work; and little on politics either,\" noted John Campbell in the Sunday Telegraph. \"The shame is that, for all his general soundness, Pugh has not written a more ambitious, more exciting book,\" said David Kynaston himself in the Financial Times. \"In short, he has not quite done the legwork. There is one other serious flaw. The 1931 census found that 78% of the population was working class, while the majority of the rest were middle class. Yet Pugh is almost bizarrely obsessed by the already overpublicised aristocracy. As a result, his index has four times as many entries for 'Cooper, Lady Diana' as for 'miners'. One does not have to be prolier than thou to find this dismaying.\" \"Grub Street Irregular: Scenes from Literary Life is never less than enormous fun,\" declared Mark Bostridge in the Independent on Sunday. \"When the history of British publishing in the last decades of the 20th century is finally written, Jeremy Lewis's trilogy may be consulted as an elegy to life in the profession before the arrival of the big conglomerates. In the meantime, enjoy the polished cadences of his writing, and the uproarious laughter it produces.\" \"No disrespect to Jeremy Lewis,\" said DJ Taylor in the Spectator, \"but it is extraordinary that books like this still get written. Here we are, after all, in the age of the Waterstone's three-for-two [and] the novels of Miss Kerry Katona . . . yet still, apparently, there is a market for garrulous book-world memoirs . . . Lewis's portraits of, among others, Alan Ross, David Hughes and DJ Enright are little masterpieces, precisely evoking not only the subject's physical characteristics but what it was like to be in a room with them . . . Similarly, his brisk diagnosis of what went wrong in the 1980s, when British publishers allowed themselves to be trampled into quiescence by a tribe of predatory agents and retailers, is spot on.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
