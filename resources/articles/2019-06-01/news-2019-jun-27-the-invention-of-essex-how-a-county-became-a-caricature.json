Some years later, in 2016, my wife, Hayley, crossed the border into Albania from Montenegro while travelling with an old friend who, like us, grew up in the county. The border guard asked where they were from \u2013 and when they told him, his response was quickfire: \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about Essex girls,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure you are not like that.\u201d Thousands of kilometres from Essex, the border guard had not only heard of this county in south-east England, but even knew what it had come to signify: a land of crass consumerism, populated by perma-tanned chancers and loose women with more front than Clacton-on-Sea. That stereotype is relatively new, but after it emerged in the 1980s, it caught on fast. Essex has since become a place simultaneously embraced as home to the real, authentic England and scorned as the crudest, stupidest symbol of Englishness. It is embraced by politicians who celebrate it as the home of no-nonsense, \u201creal\u201d people \u2013 David Cameron hired the ex-Basildon Echo reporter Andy Coulson as his head of comms \u2013 but also mocked for these same qualities, often by the very same political classes who praise its authenticity. Essex types are often recruited as comic staples of reality shows such as Love Island, First Dates, Big Brother, X Factor \u2013 and, of course, the show that re-energised the stereotype in 2010, The Only Way is Essex. Towie, the 24th series of which started this year, follows a rolling cast of tanned and toned twentysomethings as they act out relationship breakups and holiday romances on screen. The show helped propel Essex to global fame \u2013 in 2014, the Oscar-winning American actor Jennifer Lawrence declared herself addicted \u2013 and refined the Essex caricature into an extravagantly vapid parody of itself. But before Essex was a punchline, it was a dream. A place that offered hope to working-class Londoners in the form of \u201cnew towns\u201d such as Basildon and Harlow, which were built by the state to meet dire housing, sanitation and civic needs after the second world war. As the century progressed, however, parts of Essex came to represent the dismantling of this dream, as Thatcherism, the UK arm of the global new right movement that believed in lower taxes and lower public spending alongside deregulation and privatisation, became indelibly linked to the county. In 1990, a new term, \u201cEssex man\u201d, was coined by the Sunday Telegraph journalist Simon Heffer, to describe a new type of voter: a \u201cyoung, industrious, mildly brutish and culturally barren\u201d worker in London\u2019s financial centre, whose roots lay in east London, and whose political views were \u201cbreathtakingly rightwing\u201d. The piece was accompanied by an illustration of a small-foreheaded bloke in an expensive yet ill-fitting suit, drinking a can of lager in front of his shiny new motor and an ex-council house (presumably acquired thanks to Thatcher\u2019s right-to-buy reforms), resplendent with satellite dish to pick up Rupert Murdoch\u2019s new Sky television service, which was launched in the UK in 1989. Although Essex man voted Conservative, many Conservatives viewed him with a mixture of fear and horror. To some observers, it seemed as if a new kind of English person was taking over \u2013 and his rapid ascent, bypassing the traditional requirements of public school education and deference to hierarchy, seemed to threaten the very fabric of the establishment. In 1992, the British society publication Harpers &amp; Queen despaired at how \u201cEssex manners stalked the streets\u201d. Essex man, the magazine noted, embodied a vulgar capitalism that had \u201ceaten into the confidence of the old ruling class and invaded its most sacred enclaves\u201d. More than just brashly consumerist, Essex was also painted as a hotbed of bigotry, the place where white people moved to escape parts of London that were no longer white enough for them. In 1994, Lord Inglewood, a pro-European Conservative MEP, told a newspaper that the \u201cEssex view of conservatism\u201d was threatening the \u201cmore generous, less xenophobic historic tradition\u201d. (Inglewood also blamed the influence of Essex for increasing \u201cpublic bad manners, aggressiveness and yobbishness\u201d in the party.) Essex came to represent \u201cwhite flight\u201d in the UK, and there is much evidence of xenophobia and racism in Essex: the county was a hotbed of BNP membership during the first decade of the 21st century. Essex is depicted as wholly white and extremely Tory, but the reality is obviously more complex than the myth. Just as not everyone north of Manchester is a cloth-cap-wearing leave voter and most people in Islington don\u2019t eat quinoa for breakfast, it\u2019s not hard to discover that most people in Essex aren\u2019t much like those seen on Towie. Places such as Thurrock, an industrial Thameside Essex borough composed of towns fringed by marshland and ports on the river \u2013 including Tilbury, where the Windrush docked \u2013 are diversifying rapidly. West African communities have set up places of worship and specialist food shops as east European Jewish and Irish communities did before them. So why does the caricature persist? The invention of \u201cEssex\u201d is, above all, a political story. At a time when English identity \u2013 and the will of the \u201creal people\u201d \u2013 is at the centre of our politics, the usefulness of these myths becomes clearer than ever. * * * If you can visualise the map of Great Britain as a wild-haired angry monster shouting at Ireland, then Essex rests above its rectum, the Thames Estuary. If you were to draw a diagonal line from the south-west of the county to the north-east, it would measure 55 miles in length, although the creeks and inlets on its eastern side make the Essex coastline at least 400 miles. The Essex shore is home to more than 40 islands \u2013 although no one can quite agree on exactly how many \u2013 with grimly exotic names such as Lower Horse, Cindery and Foulness. Some are not much more than a lump of hardy grass protruding from a river; others, such as Canvey and Mersea, are inhabited by thousands of people who trace their roots back to London, as much of Essex can. I sometimes think of Essex itself as an island, separated from the county of Kent to its south and Suffolk to its north by the rivers Thames and Stour, from Hertfordshire to its west by the M11, and from London, loosely, by the M25 that skirts the south-west of the county. And, as with most islands, it has always been easy for those looking in to assume that they know exactly what happens there. Many nations have an Essex: a much-mocked place that has grown up in the shadow of a major city to become the supposed spiritual homeland of the nouveau riche. As much as they are mocked, these places come to symbolise something quite fundamental to the country that named them. They are viewed as the nation\u2019s id, its rawest and truest essence, but also its deepest shame at being a bit too much. In India, the sudden metamorphosis of Gurugram, an old farming town just south of Delhi, into a Dubai-like city of skyscrapers and flyovers, has made it a cultural shorthand for unabashed vulgarity. The US, of course, has New Jersey \u2013 home of straight-talking TV gangsters and the reality series Jersey Shore, inspiration for Towie \u2013 which, like Essex, has an industrially abused marshland that doesn\u2019t feature on many postcards. Essex has long been denigrated, its people viewed with condescension, parts of its flat and treeless landscape disregarded. The art historian Nikolaus Pevsner once suggested that the county\u2019s image problem predates the Roman invasion. Though only a few miles away from London, rural Essex folk have often been seen as backward by their neighbours in the capital \u2013 poor, poorly educated, clinging to superstitions long discarded by their urban counterparts. In his travelogue A Tour Thro\u2019 the Whole Island of Great Britain, published in the 1720s, Daniel Defoe wrote of Canvey Island (or \u201cCandy\u201d, as he spelled it) as a bog populated by a few hardy sheep farmers who had married multiple women from the \u201cmainland\u201d. Every time one of the men brought a new wife home, she would perish of \u201cEssex ague\u201d, a localised strain of malaria. Essex as we know it only began to take shape in the late 19th century. As London industrialised, it expanded eastwards, attracting migrants from across the country who were looking for employment. These new arrivals worked in newly built factories by day and squeezed into East End slum accommodation with their families at night. With industrialisation, east London swelled with a new breed of hustler who, if they couldn\u2019t find a job in a factory or on the docks, might take a chance hawking wares down the market or collecting rubbish from the street, hoping to sell it on. Feared at first for their provocative nature \u2013 and use of \u201cthieves\u2019s slang\u201d \u2013 these new East Enders softened into a cheekier, more approachably working-class form as the century progressed, establishing themselves enough to acquire a descriptor, Cockney. As east London became increasingly overcrowded, the Cockney\u2019s stamping ground moved eastwards, over the river Lea and into the open plains of Essex. Villages along the Thames were flattened to make way for towns that extended the logic of London as more and more people surged into Essex in the early 20th century. Ad hoc settlements also appeared. My great-grandmother moved to south Essex from Leytonstone, which is now in east London, in the 1920s, and her carpenter husband built a house in a woodland clearing that had fast become a DIY suburb. A new kind of folk hero was born: the Essex pioneer who carted their family into an uncharted land, like the American frontiersmen, and made their fortune. Formerly bucolic outposts such as West Ham, East Ham, Ilford and Barking became bustling metropolitan centres. Between 1921 and 1932, the population of Dagenham rose from 9,127 to 89,362 \u2013 an increase of 879%, largely thanks to the construction of Becontree, the largest council estate in the world. The arrival of Ford Dagenham in 1931, a huge car manufacturing plant, provided thousands of jobs. Still, the rise of manufacturing in these newly metropolitan Essex hubs did not create prosperity for everyone. A social survey of Greater London, published in 1929, described Canning Town and Silvertown as \u201cperhaps the largest area of unbroken depression in east London\u201d. After the second world war, Clement Attlee\u2019s Labour government proposed the creation of a number of new towns, mainly built in the countryside around London, to answer Britain\u2019s housing shortage. Two of the first wave of new towns, built in the late 1940s and the 50s, were located in Essex: Basildon on the Thames estuary and Harlow near Epping Forest. Both towns became home to many east Londoners whose homes had been destroyed by German bombing raids in the war. (Not that these new developments were created without a fight. When the compulsory purchase orders were put in to obtain the land to build the new towns, plotlanders and farmers protested against what one placard called \u201clegalised robbery\u201d.) For many who had moved there, this new Essex was a welcome jolt of modernity, delivering them from often squalid conditions that still characterised much of postwar London. \u201cWhen my family moved to Basildon in the 1960s, it was the first time in my life we had a house with a bathroom in it,\u201d Angela Smith, the Labour MP for Basildon between 1997 and 2010 and now the shadow leader of the House of Lords, told me. Her family moved from a flat above a shop in Hackney to the new town after the firm her father worked for relocated there. \u201cFor us it was a dream come true.\u201d Before winner-takes-all individualism came to represent Essex, the building of Harlow and Basildon embodied, through their architecture and planning, a utopian vision of society. Funding was provided to improve living conditions and quality of life. Manufacturing firms such as Yardley cosmetics in Basildon were given grants to set up in the new towns, while Harlow\u2019s town centre featured work by the English sculptor Barbara Hepworth, all of which implied that the future of the UK was to be guided by civic-minded, social democratic ideals. \u201cI believe we may well produce a new type of citizen,\u201d Lewis Silkin, Labour\u2019s minister for new towns, told the House of Commons in May 1948. \u201cA healthy, self-respecting, dignified person with a sense of beauty, culture and civic pride. In the long run that will be the real test.\u201d * * * On the first day of term in 1966, six-year-old Simon Heffer gasped. Before the summer break, his school, in an Essex village called Woodham Ferrers, had backed on to fields. Now it was surrounded by hundreds of houses. \u201cIt was awesome to see that transformation,\u201d he told me on a warm late-summer afternoon in his vast back garden in Great Leighs, an Essex village not far from where he grew up. \u201cThat was the moment I realised that nothing is for ever.\u201d This sudden arrival was part of a sprawling new web of commuter districts that spread across the south of Essex. By the 70s, the constant destruction of weatherboarded cottages and the concreting of country lanes was causing consternation among some commentators. \u201cEssex has suffered so much; the new towns, the vast growth and overspill of London, the lancing through of motorways,\u201d wrote the naturalist and author, JA Baker. The reactionary Express columnist James Wentworth Day put it more simply: \u201cEssex is becoming the dustbin of London.\u201d The development that so perturbed the schoolboy Heffer was merely a prelude. In 1972, Essex county council initiated work on a new development south of Woodham Ferrers, which was imaginatively named South Woodham Ferrers. This new \u201criverside country town\u201d shared little in common with the new towns created in the 25 years after the second world war. South Woodham was not built under the watchful eye of an autonomous development company and funded by the state, as Basildon had been. Much of South Woodham\u2019s early development was funded by the supermarket chain Asda and it was built according to a set of guidelines created by Essex county council, known as the Essex Design Guide. In contrast to the European-influenced modernism of new towns such as Basildon \u2013 which one Tory minister had dubbed \u201clittle Moscow on the Thames\u201d \u2013 the architecture of South Woodham was more traditional, with triangular roofs and nods to Essex\u2019s agricultural heritage in the form of wooden weatherboarding. \u201cUnlike most new developments,\u201d boasted the promotional video in 1981, the year the town was officially opened by the Queen, \u201cthere are no high-rise blocks and no conventional estates\u201d. The town centre was dominated by the Asda, which was built to resemble a gigantic village barn, with an old Essex-style clock tower. The retailer, which was purchased by the US giant Walmart in 1999, now owns much of the town centre since Essex county council sold it in 2001. My wife, Hayley, grew up in South Woodham and went to the same primary school as Heffer (although a couple of decades later). The arrival of families like hers, who had roots in the East End, felt like a \u201ccultural invasion\u201d, Heffer told me. Before the influx, his classmates were the children of farmers and agricultural labourers, with old Essex accents more akin to the rounded rural burr of Suffolk or Norfolk. \u201cAll these people started coming into the local pub and talking about West Ham United, which had never happened around here before,\u201d he recalled. But they had something Heffer admired. \u201cThey had a serious work ethic,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did anything they could to better themselves.\u201d After Margaret Thatcher became its leader in 1975, the Conservative party ramped up its efforts to win over voters who had moved to places like South Woodham. Their pitch was based on the promise of prosperity and home ownership, rather than the Labour party\u2019s old appeals to class solidarity. Britain was in perpetual economic turmoil in the 1970s, yet the economy of the south-east flourished in comparison to other regions, in particular the northern towns. People who had grown up in pokey London flats were saving for first homes outside London, in return for a bit more space, a garden and somewhere to park the car. The Conservatives were tapping into a desire that had shaped the history of Essex \u2013 people had long been moving east in search of space and a home of their own. And yet, in a sense, the Tories were just following the prevailing societal trends. Home ownership passed 50% in 1970 \u2013 not under the Conservatives, but under Labour, the party that built the welfare state. In 1977, Mike Leigh wrote a play that would come to be seen as an emblem of this moment, a satire of the new individualism taking shape on the edges of the capital \u2013 and a seminal document in the invention of Essex. Abigail\u2019s Party, which played to packed houses over 104 nights in Hampstead and was later adapted for TV, told the story of a suburban soiree that descended into tragic farce. It was set in Romford, an old market-turned-commuter town that was subsumed by London\u2019s boundary changes in 1965, but which many still regard as \u201cculturally Essex\u201d. The play\u2019s most enduring creation was Beverly, a monstrous, power-dressing proponent of bettering oneself through consumer choice. In developing the character, the Liverpudlian actor Alison Steadman drew upon her experiences at acting school in Essex in the late 60s. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t that thing of Essex girls, yet,\u201d Steadman told me on the phone recently. \u201cBut I knew of a girl who would say: \u2018Oh me and my sister went out at the weekend.\u2019 They would pick pubs that had posh cars in the car park,\u201d she said. \u201cYou look for a pub where there is an Aston Martin parked outside and say: there is money in there.\u201d These women were the early adopters of the consumer lifestyle that became so tightly linked to Essex. \u201cThe life I\u2019d come from was so different to that,\u201d said Steadman. \u201cIt was Liverpool, the start of the Beatles and all that, but there was no sense of being \u2018upwardly mobile\u2019.\u201d Whereas Liverpool and other northern towns had their own industries, traditions and rituals that set them apart from London, Essex had become a place to escape family memories of poverty in the city. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t satisfied at what had been going on for years and years with their parents and grandparents,\u201d Steadman said. \u201cThis was a new time when they weren\u2019t just going to sit in some little house somewhere and put up with it.\u201d Two years after Abigail\u2019s Party made its debut, the working-class Essex enclave of Basildon, along with many Labour-voting constituencies in south-east England, switched to the Tories. For many observers, it was a warning about where this new assertive individualism would lead. In a 2002 article marking the play\u2019s 25th anniversary, the writer Simon Fanshawe expressed what had, by then, become a familiar view among liberals of the new Essex voters who had helped sweep Thatcher to power. \u201cThese were the people who turned their backs on Labour and thought that by buying their own houses in a new neighbourhood, hanging net curtains to shut themselves off from a world they didn\u2019t have to look at and thus care about, they could take over the country for themselves.\u201d Then, in words that seem like they could have been lifted from a present-day jeremiad against leave voters, Fanshawe continued: \u201cNot that they knew that was what they were doing, or understood the effect it might have on the rest of us. They were far too self-centred for that.\u201d * * * One of the key architects of Thatcher\u2019s revolution was an Essex boy, or near enough. Norman Tebbit was born into a working-class family just over the border from Essex in Ponders End, Enfield. \u201cHeard a chap on the radio this morning talking with a Cockney accent,\u201d the old Etonian Tory PM Harold Macmillan said after hearing Tebbit\u2019s voice for the first time. \u201cThey tell me he is one of Her Majesty\u2019s ministers.\u201d This aspirational trajectory became Tebbit\u2019s brand: he even called his memoirs Upwardly Mobile. A grammar-school boy, Tebbit preached the gospel of self-improvement from the beginning of his political career; he was already advocating a free-market agenda when first agitating to become an MP in the 1960s. His 1981 Tory conference speech, delivered in the wake of the race riots in Toxteth and Brixton \u2013 with its infamous line that his father, unemployed in the 1930s, \u201cgot on his bike\u201d to look for work instead of rioting \u2013 is probably the best-known piece of British political oratory on the idea of meritocracy. When Tebbit became the Conservative candidate for Epping in 1970, he didn\u2019t seem to have much chance of winning. The constituency included the new town of Harlow, with its unionised East End diaspora, many of whom worked at the Ford plant in Dagenham and voted Labour. In the previous election, Epping\u2019s leftwing Labour MP Stan Newens had won a comfortable majority. Tebbit later said that when campaigning, he had his children cry out \u201cEnemy coast ahead!\u201d from the back of his car when approaching Harlow. Yet Tebbit beat Newens by offering Thatcherism before Thatcher, arguing that the government should abolish council housing while aggressively attacking Newens for his leftwing values. Two visions of Essex, and perhaps England, were vying for supremacy \u2013 and Tebbit and Thatcher\u2019s would win out. When we spoke last year at his house in Bury St Edmunds, Tebbit didn\u2019t recall having discussed Essex with Thatcher, but he was clear that it \u201cfitted with what I wanted to do and what she wanted to do\u201d. In 1980, when the new Conservative government gave council tenants the right to buy their homes, the policy was launched with a photo opportunity in the kitchen of a terraced house at 39 Amersham Road in Harold Hill, the large estate in Romford built in the 50s by London county council, which had been sold to its council tenants, the Patterson family, for just over \u00a38,000. The new policy sparked a grand sell-off along the Thames corridor, stretching from east London to the Essex coast. Barking and Dagenham lost 48,500 council units to the sell-off, while in Basildon, home ownership shot up from 53% in 1981 to 71% in 1996. The Essex-east London border was also becoming a key battleground for the war against trade unionism. Essex was \u201chighly unionised, with the Dagenham workers [at the Ford plant],\u201d Tebbit recalled. After Thatcher made him secretary of state for employment in 1981, Tebbit changed the law to require shop-floor workers to vote in a ballot, effectively leaving the unions unable to force industrial action. If the foundations for the modern idea of Essex were laid during Thatcher\u2019s first term, it was the deregulation of the City of London in 1986, during her second term, that turbocharged its development. As London\u2019s financial industry expanded eastwards to include the derelict docklands where the parents of the new residents of Essex had once worked, the legend of the barrow-boy done good in the City started to grow. \u201cCity firms could no longer afford just to take people from Oxbridge or old Etonians to work,\u201d Heffer told me with relish. \u201cPeople who came from council estates who had that instinct for making money \u2013 this was their opportunity.\u201d East Enders who had swapped London flats for a house on the other side of the green belt were now commuting back and forth, and doing very well for themselves. One day in 1990, Heffer caught the train from Essex to London to attend the funeral of Claudie Baynham, the wife of his editor at the Sunday Telegraph, Peregrine Worsthorne. On the train, Heffer encountered a City trader travelling in from Essex and talking on a brick-sized phone. But instead of making an important multi-million pound deal, or explaining to his boss he was held up on the train and was going to be late, he was on the phone to his bookies. \u201cHe was putting money on a horse,\u201d said Heffer incredulously. At the wake in Kensington, to cheer everyone up, Heffer told the story about the bloke on the train. One of the attendees, the Sunday Telegraph\u2019s deputy editor Frank Johnson, who had himself grown up in the East End, told Heffer that he had identified a fascinating social phenomenon. \u201cI said: \u2018Yes, he\u2019s Essex man!\u2019\u201d recalled Heffer, \u201cand Frank said: \u2018It\u2019s brilliant! Do it, do it!\u2019 So I went away and wrote the piece and it appeared the following Sunday.\u201d Essex man, in Heffer\u2019s portrait, was in thrall to excess without necessarily being able to handle it. \u201cWhen one walks through the City most evenings, the pools of vomit into which one may step have usually been put there by Essex man, whose greatly enhanced wealth has exceeded his breeding in terms of alcoholic capacity,\u201d he wrote. The phrase, Heffer said, was a deliberate echo of \u201cNeanderthal man\u201d \u2013 implying that Essex man was the missing link between the lumpen proles of the new town estates and the bright new citizens emerging under the stewardship of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s party. The editorial was published just before the prime minister\u2019s final Conservative party conference and seemed to rubber-stamp her legacy. The caricature wasn\u2019t exactly new: Ian Dury\u2019s 1977 song Billericay Dickie had told the story of a self-starting lothario from Essex\u2019s cockney diaspora who was \u201cdoing very well\u201d. In 1988, the comedian Harry Enfield had reached No 4 in the pop charts with a single in the persona of Loadsamoney, his self-made geezer from the London-Essex borders, waving fistfuls of \u00a350 notes. But it was Essex man that would last. \u201cHe is unencumbered by any \u2018may the best man win\u2019 philosophy,\u201d Heffer wrote. \u201cHe expects to win whether he\u2019s the best or not.\u201d * * * By now, Essex was no longer just a county in south-east England. It was a shorthand for the way the whole country seemed to be changing, for the emergence of a brash and crass new individualism \u2013 and soon, it would become a shorthand for the discomfort with those changes, for a fear about what Essex man and his pushy girlfriend threatened to reveal about the true nature of Englishness. In the late 80s, when Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran came up with the idea for Birds of a Feather, a sitcom about two sisters who end up living a life of luxury after their husbands are sent to jail for bank robbery, they decided to set it in Chigwell, a Conservative-voting south-west Essex town that \u201crepresented new money, unabashed,\u201d said Gran. \u201cThere is a lot of snobbery involved, and it can be liberal metropolitan snobbery as much as home counties conservative snobbery,\u201d Gran told me. \u201cI don\u2019t think people have to apologise for striving and achieving.\u201d While Birds of a Feather was a warmer and more subtle commentary on class than many remember, the sitcom helped give the world the female counterpart to Essex man, Essex girl. Over time, the names of its lead characters, Sharon and Tracey, came to represent sexually promiscuous and somewhat dim women from the south of the county. Essex girl was permitted even fewer redeeming features than her male counterpart. \u201cIf Essex man and Loadsamoney are monstrous figures of entrepreneurial money-making and boom economics,\u201d wrote the University of Roehampton\u2019s Heather Nunn and Anita Biressi in a study of contemporary British culture, \u201cthen the Essex girl is a monstrous figure of consumption.\u201d By the mid 90s, the threat of Essex girl was everywhere. \u201cIs Diana now an Essex Girl?\u201d the Daily Mail fretted in 1994 while reporting on an editorial in the society magazine Tatler, which begged: \u201cWill the real Diana please sit down, turn off Birds of a Feather, forget the Queen Vic [the pub from East Enders] and dress like a princess.\u201d In the Mail the following day, the writer Anne de Courcy recoiled at the \u201cSharonisation of Diana\u201d. The Sharonisation panic peaked when it was reported later that year that Volkswagen had dropped the name for the British version of its new people carrier, Sharan, because it sounded too much like the Birds of a Feather character. \u201cSome years ago we could probably have stuck with Sharan for the UK, but this Essex girl thing has arrived and we don\u2019t want to risk it,\u201d a Volkswagen UK spokesman told the Press Association. (Volkswagen\u2019s head office in Germany eventually overruled the decision.) In typical tabloid fashion, alongside all the stories poking fun at Essex types, there came the occasional story that relied on the opposite premise: that people from Essex were good-hearted strivers cruelly judged by the old establishment elites. In 1998, an 18-year-old student from Harlow called Tracy made the front pages after she was ridiculed by a Cambridge don at her interview for a place at Trinity College. \u201cThere was a poem by TS Eliot which included a line of Greek,\u201d Tracy Playle told the Daily Mail. \u201cDr Griffiths said: \u2018Being from Essex you won\u2019t know what these funny squiggles are.\u2019\u201d Playle left the interview in tears. When I spoke to her recently, Playle remembered the incident well. \u201cEveryone loves a good Essex girl story, don\u2019t they? And I\u2019m Tracy from Essex as well,\u201d she said. In the end, Playle secured a place at Warwick university \u2013 while it came out in the press that Griffiths, who died recently, was the son of a Liverpool docker. \u201cHe should have had the level of empathy he clearly didn\u2019t have,\u201d said Playle. \u201cThe fact that we even call it \u2018upward mobility\u2019 is questionable \u2013 it\u2019s not very upwards in my perspective.\u201d In 1992, the Essex Chronicle commissioned an Anglia University academic to write a report about the way people from Essex were portrayed in the press. \u201cIn exploring the stereotype,\u201d David Crouch concluded, \u201cwe discover more about the media than those it sought to depict.\u201d While Essex man was valorised by politicians for challenging class boundaries, Crouch suggested that the persistence of the Essex caricature actually proved the opposite \u2013 that snobbery was still alive and well. \u201cIs the myth, then, a search for the New Classless Britain,\u201d he wrote, \u201cor an extraordinary example, by its own action in erecting the stereotype, of exactly the reverse?\u201d Essex people were damned if they did and damned if they didn\u2019t. The people who \u201cmade it\u201d and moved to a big house in South Woodham Ferrers or Chigwell were never going to be taken seriously in the upper echelons of British society. But the people who didn\u2019t make it there and were still languishing in Basildon or Harlow were even worse. * * * Basildon, once a beacon of Labour\u2019s postwar consensus politics, voted for Thatcher in every election she fought \u2013 until the name of the town itself came to somehow represent the societal shift that had taken place from socialist-influenced policymaking to I\u2019m-all-right-Jack Thatcherism. \u201c[The] organised working class is disappearing as people have more individualistic aims, more privatised aims,\u201d Basildon\u2019s Conservative MP, David Amess, told Channel 4 News with an air of triumph in 1992, despite his slim majority in that election. \u201cThey buy their houses, they purchase their shares.\u201d For Basildon, and by extension Essex, and maybe even the country itself, there seemed to be no coming back. And so a new sub-species was born: Basildon man, who was really just Essex man under a new name. But Basildon is where the Essex myth collides with reality. While the new town was painted as the centre of the Essex phenomenon, it didn\u2019t fit into the picture of Essex as a place for the newly wealthy to make hay. In the 90s, the centre-left thinktank Demos conducted a survey of skilled workers in Basildon: in 1992, 64% earned less than \u00a315,000 (\u00a322,000 in today\u2019s money), relatively poor by the standards of the south-east; by 1997, 32% earned less than \u00a310,000. The Conservative party may have succeeded in identifying the desires of these children of London, but it didn\u2019t offer much to satisfy them. What it offered instead was an illusory promise. \u201cThere was this false understanding that Margaret Thatcher was a strong woman who could provide economic opportunities, she understood you wanting to get on,\u201d Basildon\u2019s former MP Angela Smith, who won a majority as Labour returned in 1997, told me. \u201cBut the policies were so damaging if you look at unemployment, you look at the industry. Look how Basildon has changed.\u201d Today, Basildon is a poster child of inequality. It contains a quarter of the most deprived areas of Essex, despite housing an eighth of its total population, and is the sixth most unequal town in the country. Pitched against such evidence, the myth of Essex as the great Thatcherite success story says more about the will of the Conservative commentariat than anything else. In the mid-1980s, my parents bought the Southend council house my sister and I grew up in, but we didn\u2019t feel like triumphant beneficiaries of some economic miracle. A microclimate of inequality existed on our street, separating homeowners from council tenants. I remember my mum and dad refusing to sign one London-born homeowner\u2019s petition to have his sister, a renter, evicted for being the mother of a \u201cproblem family\u201d. No one seemed any richer, just further apart. The dream of selling your council house, making loads of money and paying lower and lower taxes didn\u2019t work out for everyone \u2013 but that didn\u2019t discredit the power of the Essex myth. History, after all, is written by the victors. There are signs that the thread linking the idea of Essex to a distinctively Thatcherite model of \u201cevery Essex man for himself\u201d is wearing thin, as Essex grows tired of cuts to public services after a decade of austerity. Local elections in early June resulted in Labour capturing Southend council for the first time in its history, and Basildon council now also has a Labour leader. But the spectre of Essex man is still haunting our politics \u2013 now as a gung-ho hard Brexiteer. If Essex man has ever inhabited a physical form, it is surely Mark Francois, the arch-Brexiter MP for Rayleigh and Wickford, who grew up in Basildon and worked in the City before entering politics. (He was lovingly described as \u201cevery bit an Essex man\u201d by Quentin Letts in the Daily Mail in 2009.) His star has risen in line with an increasing demand for polarising soundbites on Brexit: infamous moments include Francois angrily quoting Tennyson behind a picture of Margaret Thatcher, angrily ripping up a letter from the German CEO of Airbus about Brexit on live TV and angrily making a throat-slitting gesture as Theresa May spoke in the Commons. The rise of Francois is testament to the ultimate success of \u201cEssex man\u201d as a template for the barbaric, tell-it-like-it-is tone of the rightwing press \u2013 and, increasingly, the hard-man posturing of today\u2019s insurgent reactionaries. In 2009, after Francois had become an MP, David Cameron promoted him to the shadow cabinet as a sop to the Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative party. It is a faction that doesn\u2019t seem to have been satisfied yet. The persistent rhetorical power of this invented Essex \u2013 as a land of a million Marks Francois, ready to die for No Deal \u2013 requires that we continue to overlook the reality of the actual place. \u201cThere is still a conversation, even today, black folk in London saying to me, seriously: \u2018What are you doing in Essex?\u2019\u201d says Southend-based artist Elsa James, whose work addresses stereotypes of people of African-Caribbean heritage and those of Essex women. Parts of Essex, James says, are more diverse than is widely acknowledged: there were 50 mother tongues among the students at the Southend primary school her youngest daughter attended. And there is the small matter of the Windrush, the ship that carried about 500 migrants from the Caribbean and docked in Tilbury in 1948. \u201cEssex actually symbolises the rise of multicultural Britain,\u201d says James. Perhaps one reason the Essex myth persists is the allure of an \u201cauthentic\u201d England \u2013 whose views coincidentally always align with the politician currently invoking them. These days, the idea of \u201cEssex\u201d is primarily deployed on behalf of an extreme rightwing ideological project, whose latest cause is hard Brexit. In the press, confident pronouncements about \u201cwhat the working class wants\u201d \u2013 a rhetorical style that the writer Joe Kennedy calls \u201cauthentocracy\u201d \u2013 invariably fixate on flags and foreigners rather than a living wage and local services. \u201cWe\u2019re an entrepreneurial county, we don\u2019t like being interfered with, we don\u2019t like bureaucracy,\u201d the MP for Harwich, Bernard Jenkin, told me when I asked him why Essex voted Brexit. \u201cIf you go to Surrey or Sussex or Buckinghamshire and the university cities like Oxford and Cambridge, you really are still in the M25 bubble. Essex is not part of the metropolitan bubble \u2026 People have got their feet on the ground.\u201d This, finally, is the magic power of \u201cEssex\u201d. For it allows Jenkin \u2013 the Cambridge-educated son of a lord \u2013 to confidently proclaim that he knows the desires of the \u201ccommon man\u201d, merely by the mention of this most misunderstood of counties. If Essex did not exist, they would need to invent it. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
