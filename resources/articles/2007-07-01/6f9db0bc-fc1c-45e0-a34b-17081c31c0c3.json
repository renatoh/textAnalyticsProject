It got me wondering as to which English team (and foreign for that matter) had the most losses under their belt?\" According to this excellent site, the world's oldest professional club, Notts County, have the most English league defeats under their belt, Campbell. The Magpies have notched up an impressive 1,704 defeats from 4,434 matches (38.43%), with 548 of them coming at home (more than any other team) and 1,156 of them on the road. Grimsby - the only team with more away defeats (1,206) - come a close second overall with 1,699 defeats in 4,320 games, which is actually a higher losing average of 39.33%. The top 10 losers in English league football are as follows: 1) Notts County 1,704 defeats 2) Grimsby Town 1,699 3) Bury 1,659 4) Lincoln City 1,649 5) Burnley 1,633 6) Stockport County 1,628 7) Barnsley 1,602 8) West Brom 1,601 9) Bolton Wanderers 1,594 10) Leyton Orient 1,589 Just for the record, the draw specialists are Preston North End, who have grinded out a whopping 1,104 stalemates from 4,408 games in their history (25.05%). And the most wins? Amazingly, Manchester Utd and Liverpool have won 1,935 games each, but since Liverpool have played 32 matches fewer, they have a superior winning average (47.13% to 46.76%).

THE THIRD DIMENSION \"Oldham Athletic are about to commence their 11th consecutive season in League 1 (or its equivalent),\" notes Thomas McCann. \"Have any other teams spent so long in England's third tier or do Oldham now hold the record?\" Oldham are a long way from breaking the record, Thomas. \"Some random digging finds that Reading were in Division Three (South) and Division Three for 34 seasons, straddling the second world war, from 1931 until relegation in 1971,\" writes Wayne Ziants. \"How's that?\" It's good, but it's not the one. In fact, Bournemouth &amp; Boscombe Athletic (now AFC Bournemouth) have spent the longest time in the third tier, from 1923 until their eventual relegation in 1970, as the ever-trusty www.rsssf.com can testify. OUTFIELD PLAYERS BECOMING GOALKEEPERS (2) Last week we looked into the players that were converted into goalkeepers, but it seems there are a few examples we missed out ... \"Walsall full-back Roy John was converted to a keeper in an emergency, played a blinder or two, held his place and went on to be capped by Wales,\" writes Paul Brookes. \"He made his international debut while a Walsall player in 1931, transferred to Stoke City, Preston and Swansea and was first-choice keeper until 1939, together with playing the first wartime international in 1939 against England at Ninian Park. Roy was considered one of Wales's best ever keepers.\" More recently, tubby Swedish midfielder Tomas Brolin ended his days as a Dr Alban accomplice, Jacuzzi advertiser and vacuum cleaner vendor to put his sizeable frame to good use between the sticks. Brolin returned to the town of his birth and helped out Swedish second division side Hudiksvalls as an occasional goalkeeper, playing alongside his brother H\u00e5kan. Finally, Reuben Conceicao provides us with this biography excerpt from Gigi Buffon online, dedicated to the Italian keeper. Interestingly, \"as a young boy growing up in Italy, Gigi played as a midfielder. However [when he was 14] he decided to change his position to goalkeeper after he lost the will to run.\" KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"I have a vague memory of sleeping off my jet-lag shortly after arrival in Australia 1996, while watching the TV highlights of a game in which an Australian league team came back from 5-0 down to draw 5-5,\" said Will Dyer in 2005. \"Was it a dream, or did it really happen?\" \"Will was close,\" explained Sydney resident Thomas Haerland. \"On February 16 1996, Newcastle Breakers drew 5-5 with Canberra Cosmos, yet it was only a measly four-goal comeback. After Canberra scored an own goal in the 49th minute to make it 4-0 to Newcastle, they pulled a goal back through Paul Wade soon after, before a 62nd-minute Troy Halpin strike (completing his hat-trick) left them 5-1 down. However, goals from Michael Musitano (69), Norman Kelly (78), Jason Dunn (83) and Wade again (88) helped them force the draw. The majority of the 2,817 crowd in the Breakers Stadium went home a little frustrated.\" Click here for thousands more Knowledge questions and answers.
