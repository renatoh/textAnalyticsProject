But time is all we have, and it is what the announcement was about. This is how it happened. Water vapour in the atmosphere absorbs radiation at certain wavelengths. At 10,000ft in altitude and with a winter temperature of more than 50C below zero, the south pole is about the driest place on Earth. So astronomers there could, for the first time, identify the imprint of gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background radiation. That cosmic microwave background is a remnant \u2013 an afterglow, or perhaps a faint hum \u2013 of the big bang moment in which time, space and matter all began 13.8bn years ago. The once-conjectural gravitational waves that the astronomers claim to have identified in the afterglow are hailed as the first direct evidence of what, until now, had been an equally conjectural phenomenon called cosmic inflation. This was a brief episode early in the history of the universe when space itself inflated far faster than the speed of light. By \"early\", cosmologists mean a fraction of a second expressed by a zero, a decimal point and then between 34, and 37 zeros before the first numeral. That is, somewhere between 10 million billion billion billionths and 10 trillion trillion trillionths of a second. In the subatomic or quantum world, that's the relevant pace. Humans need about a quarter of a second to register a thought, so such a period is unimaginable. But here's the paradox: physicists did imagine it, predict it, and then identify the moment and they did all this in 33 years. Cosmic inflation is the process that made the universe we inhabit big enough, and enduring enough, to house sentient life. We are here, 13.8bn years later, because of something that happened so soon after the beginning, that then made galaxies, stars, planets, prophets, politicians and physicists possible, roughly in that order. It is almost 50 years since two radio astronomers detected, in the darkness between the galaxies, the faint background radiation of the big bang, and were able to confirm that there was indeed a moment of creation. Next came the calculation of the timetable that led, ultimately, to the clouds of hydrogen gas that became the starting point for 92 elements, and us. That achievement was made possible by a generous informal partnership of scientists from every continent. If confirmed, then it represents a triumph of pure research and it offers a refreshing perspective on time itself \u2013 and perhaps human ambition, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
