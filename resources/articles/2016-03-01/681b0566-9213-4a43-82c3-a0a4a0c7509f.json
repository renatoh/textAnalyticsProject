The former London mayor escalated the controversy amid speculation that Jarvis is planning to challenge Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership after he took the \u00a316,800 donation from Martin Taylor and made a wide-ranging speech about the future of the party. Livingstone, a strong supporter of Corbyn, subsequently made the Savile comparison on LBC, prompting a string of Labour figures to condemn the remarks. Alan Johnson, the Labour former home secretary, said Livingstone should \u201ckeep his trap shut\u201d, while Ian Austin, another Labour MP, said it was \u201cdisgusting\u201d. But Livingstone stuck to his comments, saying no Labour MP should be taking money from the hedge-fund industry. He told BBC News on Friday: \u201cAll hedge-fund managers want is to know that they\u2019re going to have a prime minister who\u2019s going to allow them to continue to evade tax, and it\u2019s totally unacceptable for hedge-fund managers to be contributing to anyone in the Labour party. \u201cNo one in the Labour party who\u2019s genuinely Labour would want to take a penny from them.\u201d Pressed on his choice of words, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s meant to be deliberately provocative because I\u2019m saying to Dan Jarvis if you want to be a serious player in the Labour party, don\u2019t mix with these people, they\u2019re sick.\u201d When asked about the comments John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said that \u201cKen is Ken\u201d while also welcoming the contribution that the \u201chonest and decent\u201d Jarvis is making to Labour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
