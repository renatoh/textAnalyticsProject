There are now 80,000 prisoners in our jails, which are full. Ashworth high-security hospital is to be converted in part to be a prison. Thus the prisons are full of the mentally ill and addicted who are having punishment added to the torture of their illness. How is it possible that in 2007 we have closed most of the large therapeutic psychiatric hospitals and instead are putting the patients into our prisons? If we were to provide sufficient psychiatric beds in hospitals for the mentally ill and addicted, prisons would be practically empty. Psychiatric patients only offend against the law because their brain chemistry has been disturbed by their illness. Hallucinatory voices may instruct them to do shocking things. Let us put a stop to the imprisoning of the mentally ill and addicted. We are damaging the lives of many families and cruelly treating the severely mentally ill. Gwynneth Hemmings Director, Schizophrenia Association of Great Britain The \"massive use made of the new indefinite public protection sentences\" cited in your leader (Beyond blame, January 30) should come as no surprise to anyone. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 made it compulsory for courts to pass indefinite sentences on offenders convicted of specified violent or sexual offences if they pose a risk of future \"serious harm\". The specified offences range widely in gravity. For example, they include crimes such as causing grievous bodily harm, which ranges from near-murder to knocking someone's tooth out. The court of appeal has held that courts should presume that anyone convicted of one of the specified offences who has previous convictions is dangerous unless this conclusion would be \"unreasonable\". Some courts have responded to this combination of statute and appeal court guidance by using the new sentence almost automatically for offenders convicted of specified offences. This is why the number of such sentences has been so much higher than expected. Indefinite sentences should be used only when there is clear positive evidence that the offender is a serious danger. The government should amend the law so that the use of indefinite sentences is left to courts' discretion unconstrained by presumptions of dangerousness. Paul Cavadino Nacro, the crime reduction charity Since February 2000, we have had three home secretaries and five junior prisons ministers. The blame for any confusion over who's doing what, what's going on where, and when did they tell who, lies with the man blowing his whistle every 14 months and asking people to find a different chair - Tony Blair.
