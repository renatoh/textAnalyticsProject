At one stage Rusedski was on the verge of going two sets to one down, but he somehow managed to save three set-points to win the third set on a tie-break. From then on the British No2 never looked back, booking his place in the second round with a 6-1, 4-6, 7-6, 6-3 victory. Playing in the cavernous Louis Armstrong stadium, Rusedski overpowered Kim in the opening set, winning the first five games before the former collegiate champion at Stanford University was able to even hold serve. Kim, who knocked Yevgeny Kafelnikov out of the Australian Open earlier this year, was unable to cope with Rusedski's serve - he hit seven aces - although the fastest was clocked at only 96mph. But any designs the British player had of making quick work of his opponent were laid to waste in the second set. Rusedski, who came into the tournament after beating the Lleyton Hewitt and Marat Safin at the RCA Championships earlier this month, broke Kim again in the third game. However, he then inexplicably lost the initiative in his next service game, giving Kim three chances to break. Rusedski saved the first with an ace and the second with an overhead slam, before Kim finally broke back with a return cross court winner. Then, at 5-4 and breakpoint down, Rusedski came into the net and tried to volley a ball which Kim had rocketed towards his midsection. The backhand volley sailed beyond the baseline and Kim pumped his fist in the air. Things soon went from bad to worse as Kim broke again to go 3-1 up in the third. At that stage Rusedski's serve was awry and his forehand was erratic. But, with the British No2 on the ropes at 5-3 and 0-40 down, Kim failed to finish him off. Rusedski saved three sets points before winning the set on a tie-break. The final set was much easier for Rusedski, a solitary break ensuring victory after just over two hours of play."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
