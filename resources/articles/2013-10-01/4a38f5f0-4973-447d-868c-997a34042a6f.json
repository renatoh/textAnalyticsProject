Lame ducks more like. Sunderland and Swansea City both face big weeks and, while one team is resurgently ready, the other is in pieces. There are no prizes for guessing which is which. Michael Laudrup's pass-masters are back to something like their admirable best and will have one cultured foot in the knockout stages of the Europa League if they follow up this emphatic win by beating Russia's Kuban Krasnodar at the Liberty Stadium on Thursday. Sunderland, in contrast, could hardly be in worse shape going into their derby at home to Newcastle United on Sunday. Statistically, no Premier League team have made a worse start to the season and, with a miserable one point from eight games, Sunderland already face a relegation battle. Gus Poyet was shell-shocked after seeing his new side show all the resilience of a pricked balloon after conceding the first goal. Two more followed in the next seven minutes and the collapse was such that the final margin could have been much wider. Poyet cannot be blamed, of course. With players away on international duty he had only two training sessions to prepare the demoralised ragbag he inherited from the unlamented Paolo Di Canio and the spirit he managed to instil in them was evident in a goalless, even-steven first half, only for it all to drain away as soon as they fell behind. Sunderland have now had nine managers in the last 10 years. Once known as \"The Bank of England club\" they have long nursed aspirations beyond their means and the obvious need is for continuity and consistency. Cynics will say six league defeats in succession is nothing if not consistent but the board could do a lot worse than take their lead from Swansea, whose enviable football is the product not only of good management but also of excellent choices of manager. If there is a more astute chairman in the Premier League than Huw Jenkins he does not spring readily to mind, Laudrup being the latest of intelligent appointments that started with Kenny Jackett and continued with Roberto Mart\u00ednez, Paulo Sousa and Brendan Rodgers. All have played the same pleasing, passing game, so that continuity has been maintained whenever the manager has been poached. Jenkins is always worth listening to and says of Sunderland: \"The added pressures of continual change can unsettle any football club\", adding: \"Something needs to be consistent to provide stability.\" Sunderland started with the bristling resolve one expects from players keen to impress new management and a threatening early shot from Steven Fletcher had Laudrup on his feet in more animated style than is his custom. Poyet was the happier manager after the first half and told his team that, if they could just manage a little more going forward, they might achieve the win they needed so badly. In the other dressing room Laudrup was demanding more urgent movement, on and off the ball, and a higher tempo. It is just conceivable the outcome might have been very different had Phil Bardsley, an outcast under Di Canio, not spoiled his return by wasting a gilt-edged chance at the start of the second half. Reprieved, Swansea upped their game and took charge. Michu, Wilfried Bony and Nathan Dyer all threatened with shots before poor Bardsley was left red-faced again by an own-goal after Angel Rangel had flicked on a Jonathan De Guzman corner. Sunderland's brittle morale disintegrated. De Guzman curled in a lovely 25-yarder, Craig Gardner tripped Leon Britton to enable Bony to score from the spot and another De Guzman corner saw Chico Flores's stooping header go in off Fletcher. Poyet tried, unsuccessfully, to sound upbeat. He said: \"This is not like a pre-season for me, there is no time to improve bit by bit, physically and mentally. The players need to improve now. That's our task. It's difficult but I believe it's possible. \"The game [against Newcastle] is on Sunday so it's great for me to have a full week with them, on the pitch every day. The derby is an opportunity for us. Can we do it? I believe we can. We're going to work so hard this week that it's possible.\" Man of the match Leon Britton (Swansea)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
