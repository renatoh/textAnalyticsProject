Rougier was a hard-packed, shrink-wrapped compression of energy and power, eager \"just to get out there, touch the ball, express myself\". His first action was to dribble down the left wing, his feet moving so quickly he was wobbling to an excited \"whoa\" from the crowd. His second was to hold off two challenges while prone and, when assailed by a third, to flip both legs over his body in a move that looked part aerobic, part superheroic, to scoop possession again. His third, within three minutes of replacing Paul Brooker, was to toe the ball past Tony Warner for Brighton's third win in succession. There had been other opportunities - Zamora hit a post - but until then the home side had seemed incapable of shooting before they had narrowed the angle to the point that they had also narrowed their chances. Not just for that is Rougier an example that will serve Brighton. In 1995 he paid his own way from Trinidad and Tobago to Bradford, did not obtain a work permit but \"didn't give up\" either. Via Raith Rovers, Hibernian, Port Vale and Reading, from whom he is on a month's loan, he arrived in Sussex \"only through prayer\". He lives, he says, \"every day for my Lord\" and hopes \"to exalt him by playing well\". Saturday's goal will have given everyone at the club hope. That, and Christophe Kinet's miss after 90 minutes. For much of this match Millwall were largely rebuffed from distance - Steven Reid, a returning Neil Harris and Paul Ifill all had chances - but in the closing movements they pressed until, in time added on, Dave Beasant came out to punch clear but instead removed the ball by no more than three feet and the Belgian shot wide. Whether or not the result makes Coppell's task less than the \"almost impossible\" one he found on arrival at the club \"depends on [his] mood\". \"I have all the fixtures on a wall in my office,\" he said. \"I still look at them and think, 'Blimey, this is a huge mountain to climb.'\" Rougier has what Coppell needs: \"Faith.\" Man of the match: Danny Cullip (Brighton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
