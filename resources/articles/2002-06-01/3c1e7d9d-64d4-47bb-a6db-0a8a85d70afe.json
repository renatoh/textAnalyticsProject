But the display by one of the World Cup's most exciting strikers may have given the Republic of Ireland manager a few butterflies ahead of Sunday's meeting. Raul scored for the second and third times in the tournament to help Spain win this group and earn them a second-round match against Ireland. Having been told by his coach Jose Camacho to carry the team, the Real Madrid star is certainly flexing his muscles. He took his goals comfortably enough, the first after an embarrassing error by the former Fulham and Oxford United goalkeeper Andre Arendse. If Raul's instinct is impressive, so too is his tendency to drop back and set up play. McCarthy must decide whether to ask one of his centre-backs to stay close to Raul when he pulls into deeper positions, thus leaving gaps in defence, or instruct the nearest midfielder to close him down. Twice South Africa equalised, the second time through Lucas Radebe, before Raul headed in a winner which sent Jomo Sono's team out of the competition. \"Ireland definitely have a chance against Spain,\" said Quinton Fortune, South Africa's Manchester United midfielder. \"They are more defensive than us and more compact. With the players Ireland have they can win.\" That depends on Ireland's ability to contain Spain's attack. Another player to have caught McCarthy's eye may have been Joaquin, a young right-sided midfielder who set up Raul's decisive strike and provided two other crosses which almost brought goals. The Real Betis player is not expected to start on Sunday but he could be used as a substitute and has the speed and skill to beat markers. On the opposite flank Gaizka Mendieta made his first appearance of the tournament and scored with a free-kick. Spain deserved their win and will go into the Ireland game on the back of three straight victories. Camacho knows failure to extend that to four would go down badly. \"Ireland are a competitive team,\" he said. \"They play direct football, always trying to win. But we are on a high level as well. It will be exciting.\" This was certainly that. Raul had put Spain ahead inside five minutes after Arendse let Mendieta's pass slip from his grasp. But, if South Africa looked poor at the back, they were exciting going forward and Benny McCarthy levelled. Mendieta's free-kick gave Spain a half-time lead which was wiped out when Radebe headed in Fortune's corner for a rare goal for the Leeds player. A draw would have seen South Africa through but Raul beat Radebe to a cross to snatch the winner. McCarthy must beware a similar scenario on Sunday.
