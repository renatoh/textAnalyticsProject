A spokesman for Norfolk fire service said: \"We currently have numerous appliances at the scene. We do not believe there are any chemicals involved.\" He said the fire had been located within the site, which brings natural gas ashore from the North Sea. Bacton is one of Britain's largest gas terminal complexes. Gas lands onshore at the three producer terminals from the southern North Sea and distributed to UK customers via the National Grid terminal, or to Belgium via the Interconnector system."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
