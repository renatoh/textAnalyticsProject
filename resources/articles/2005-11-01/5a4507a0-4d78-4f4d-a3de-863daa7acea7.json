You would think most executives in large corporations would dismiss the concept of work/life balance as a load of tosh - but far from it. These refuseniks apparently also want to spend more time with their families or pursuing hobbies, according to a survey from a study published today by the public relations firm Burston-Marsteller and thinktank the Economist Intelligence Unit. According to Who Wants to Be a CEO, disillusionment is greatest in the US, that bastion of capitalism, where 64% would decline the offer of the top job. Europe comes in second with 60% and Asia third with 51%. Latin Americans are the least negative - only 27% do not want to be CEO. The overall figure is 54%. Other reasons cited for turning down the top job are the tyranny of quarterly earnings, persistent stress and intense public scrutiny. The study cites the example of Jeff Immelt, the boss of highly profitable US conglomerate General Electric, who works 100-hour weeks and spends 60% of his time on the road. Executives are less likely to cite the actual pressures of running a business - regulatory oversight, cost-cutting, talent-spotting, stakeholder demands and media scrutiny - as a reason to pass up the CEO's job. Although generous compensation, perks and prestige dominate headlines worldwide, they are among the least compelling reasons given by global businessmen for wanting to be CEO. The top three reasons are the opportunity for complex problem-solving (56%), the ability to have a personal impact on the business (43%) and the satisfaction of having ideas implemented (36%). \"CEOs today are increasingly challenged by time zones, global markets, unpredictable crises and an expanding portfolio of stakeholders demanding attention,\" said Dr Leslie Gaines-Ross, Burson-Marsteller's chief knowledge and research officer worldwide. \"Not until companies train the next generation of leaders to better balance work/life pressures will executives clamour for the top job.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
