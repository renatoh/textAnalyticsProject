After the runaway success of her directorial debut, The Babadook, Kent\u2019s colonial revenge drama drew controversy \u2013 and wide acclaim \u2013 for its confronting depiction of rape and violence during the frontier war massacres in Tasmania. The Nightingale already nabbed two awards at the Aactas\u2019 first celebration earlier in the week: for best casting and best supporting actress for Magnolia Maymuru. Kent was one of many winners who did not attend the ceremony; Uncle Jim Everett, a Tasmanian Indigenous elder who consulted on the film, accepted on her behalf. Aisling Franciosi won best lead actress for her role in the film. A tearful Stan Grant accepted the award for best documentary for The Australian Dream, directed by Daniel Gordon. Grant, who wrote the screenplay and features in the film, paid tribute to its subject, the former AFL player Adam Goodes, for having the courage to go through some of his life\u2019s darkest moments for the film. \u201cThis was not just about Adam Goodes,\u201d Grant said. \u201cIt was about the two centuries that led up to the booing of Adam Goodes.\u201d Deborah Mailman took out the first Aacta award of the night for best lead in a television drama for her role in ABC political series Total Control, which also won best drama. Already a five-time Aacta/AFI winner, including for her supporting role in Mystery Road last year, Mailman said this was a particularly significant win given it was her first in the category. \u201cI\u2019m actually really emotional, this show has meant everything to me, it\u2019s my first lead role in a drama series,\u201d Mailman said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing in terms of the diversity of people, I\u2019ve had so many people stop me on the street, saying that they\u2019re loving the show, that they\u2019re watching it \u2013 it\u2019s been fantastic.\u201d Mailman\u2019s co-star Rachel Griffiths won best supporting actress for her part in the series, but it was Lambs of God that dominated this year\u2019s TV categories, receiving eight awards in total, including for best miniseries, best direction, best cinematography, best original score and best sound. Sam Neill was visibly emotional when he was honoured with the Longford Lyell lifetime achievement award \u2013 with Meryl Streep, Jane Campion, Nicole Kidman and Liam Neeson among those offering tributes. \u201cThe lifetime thing sounds a little terminal and I hope they don\u2019t mean it\u2019s the end because I\u2019m not done, I would still like to put a few more runs on the board,\u201d Neill said. ABC parenting comedy The Letdown won in two categories \u2013 best comedy series, and best performance in a comedy, for its lead and co-creator Alison Bell. Damon Herriman, who broke Aacta history with the most nominations across four different performance categories in a year, won best lead actor for the film Judy &amp; Punch, saying it was the best script he had ever read. Herriman was twice nominated as best supporting actor in a TV drama for his roles in Lambs of God and Mr Inbetween, but was beaten by Richard Roxburgh for The Hunting. Best lead actor in a TV drama went to Herriman\u2019s Mr Inbetween co-star Scott Ryan; the ABC\u2019s You Can\u2019t Ask That won best factual entertainment program, and Parasite continued its early sweep of awards season, winning best Asian film for its director, Bong Joon-ho.
