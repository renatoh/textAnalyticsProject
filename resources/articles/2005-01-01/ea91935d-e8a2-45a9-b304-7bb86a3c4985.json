Firstly, they are some of the world's most stunning and fragile natural environments, inhabited by wonderfully friendly and hospitable people. Secondly, they are some of the poorest areas of the world. Finally, they are highly dependent on tourism for jobs, incomes and livelihoods. Some tourist areas have been destroyed, while others (particularly inland) remain intact. While currently dealing with the tragic effects of events, in the coming weeks and months local people will begin to rebuild their lives. This will become an even harder task if tourism declines and local people lose their jobs and incomes. Our thoughts go out to all those affected by this terrible natural disaster. While it may seem premature to us to be talking about holiday-making in the affected regions, many local people are increasingly concerned that we do. We had seven clients in Sri Lanka, all of whom are thankfully safe. After speaking with our local operator in Sri Lanka, two more clients departed for the island on December 28. One of the reasons they gave was that they wanted to support thelocal tourism industry and economy. Our Sri Lankan operator said, \"We are in desperate need of support; they are a wonderful couple and we are going to give them a fabulous holiday'. Next week will see the beginning of the busiest holiday booking period of the year. It's vitally important that, after speaking with their tour operators and local accommodation owners about the situation on the ground, those who had planned to visit the affected regions go ahead with their travel plans. We would encourage people to travel responsibly and sensitively. This will increase the benefits to local people, and bring you closer to local culture and nature. By staying in locally owned accommodation, rather than overseas owned resorts, more of your money will \"trickle down\" into the hands of those who need it most - local people. Hire a local guide - not only will they be sensitive to local people's feelings and earn an income, but they will give you unmatched insights into local cultures. Use public transport, and visit local restaurants rather than eating in resort hotels - it's a terrific way to support local economies and meet local people on their terms. Before you travel ask your travel representative what would be the most useful gifts for you to take out for local people at this time. Ask if there are any social or environmental projects that you might visit during your trip, and how you might productively be involved. Before you leave buy your gifts for people back home directly from local craft sellers. Finally, to any undecided about their 2005 travel plans: do your research into affected destinations, but book an Indian Ocean holiday and make a real difference where it matters most. You'll not receive a warmer welcome anywhere in 2005. \u00b7 For the latest information on a destination in the region, contact your tour operator and check the Foreign Office website, fco.gov.uk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
