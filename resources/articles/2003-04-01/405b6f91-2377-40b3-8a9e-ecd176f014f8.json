He is the author of One No Many Yeses: a journey to the heart of the global resistance movement (Free Press), an introduction to the new politics of anti-globalisation. Paul Kingsnorth's website 1. Essays by George Orwell This collection of classic essays covers everything from English patriotism to political language, by way of life in the Burmese police and the Spanish civil war. Always forceful, never predictable, the quality of Orwell's writing serves to demonstrate how few good political writers are around today. 2. Upside Down by Eduardo Galeano One of the few is the Uruguayan Eduardo Galeano. In this, as in his other writing, he is playful, poetic and angry as he dissects the absurdities and injustices of the modern world. One to make you look at the world with new eyes. 3. False Dawn by John Gray For my money, the best book yet written about modern day capitalism. Gray's controversial thesis is that globalisation is doomed to fail, and he lays it out with a provocative erudition which, whatever your view, will probably make you reconsider it. 4. Our Word is Our Weapon by Subcomandante Marcos Masked spokesman of Mexico's Zapatista rebels and inspiration for the anti-globalisation movement, Marcos is also a political writer of real significance. And he has a sense of humour. These dispatches from the frontlines are essential reading. 5. Civil Disobedience by Henry David Thoreau One of the all-time benchmarks of dissenting writing, Civil Disobedience, written in 1849, reflects on slavery, war, rebellion and every person's right to rebel. The inspiration behind many a non-violent resistance movement since. 6. Copse by Kate Evans Subtitled 'the cartoon book of tree protesting', Copse shows what happens when people take Thoreau up on his ideas. An illustrated journey through the British road protest movement of the 1990s, it is funny, bizarre, acerbic and moving, often all at once. Already a classic. 7. Rights of Man by Thomas Paine This great defence of the ideals of the French revolution was so controversial on its publication that Paine, seen as a genuine threat to the British establishment, was driven out of the country. So he must have been doing something right. 8. Manufacturing Consent by Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman If you want to understand how the modern media acts to 'filter out' radical views and inconvenient facts, read this book. Even if you disagree with every page, it will make you think hard about where you get your information - and who from. 9. Culture Jam by Kalle Lasn Lasn, editor of the Canadian magazine Adbusters, provides a cogent, funny, and sparkily written introduction to mass-marketing, consumer alienation and the 'culture jamming' that people are employing in response. 10. Soil and Soul by Alastair McIntosh To the trading floors of the global market via the mountains of McIntosh's home island of Lewis, in the Hebrides, this is an elegaic meditation on the link between people and place, and how it can be reforged in a globalised world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
