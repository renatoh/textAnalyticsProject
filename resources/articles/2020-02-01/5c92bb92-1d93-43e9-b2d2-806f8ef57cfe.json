Varadkar submitted his resignation to Michael D Higgins, the president of Ireland, on Thursday night after a tempestuous but inconclusive sitting of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, which met for the first time since the 8 February election. It adjourned until 5 March, giving party leaders three weeks to try to form a ruling coalition. The Fine Gael leader and his administration will continue to work in their current roles until successors are appointed but will avoid major policy decisions, financial allocations and public appointments \u201cunless absolutely necessary\u201d, and only then after consultation with other parties. Varadkar, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, Mary Lou McDonald, the Fianna F\u00e1il leader, Miche\u00e1l Martin, and the Green party leader, Eamon Ryan, were nominated for taoiseach by their parties but all, as expected, fell far short of an 80-seat majority in the 160-seat chamber. McDonald won the most votes, 45, with 84 against and 29 abstentions. Martin won 41, with 97 against and 19 abstentions. Varadkar won 36, with 107 against and 16 abstentions. Ryan won 12, with 115 against and 28 abstentions. The 33rd d\u00e1il opened amid pomp and ceremony but the stalemate put it on ice after just a day, reflecting a deeply fragmented political landscape. Vitriolic exchanges between party leaders after the votes underlined the challenge of forming a government, a process that could take weeks or even months, and end in another election. Martin reiterated his opposition to working with Sinn F\u00e9in in an onslaught on the party\u2019s links to the IRA during and since the Troubles. \u201cWhen I raised the issue of the systematic cover-up of child abuse by the Provisional IRA, I was called a lowlife by deputies present here today,\u201d he said. He also accused Sinn F\u00e9in of antisemitism and peddling a manifesto of spendthrift populism. McDonald hit back, saying Martin shared a cabinet table with colleagues convicted of corruption and that he reflected an old, discredited duopoly that sought to ignore voters\u2019 desire for change. \u201cI see we still live rent-free in Miche\u00e1l Martin\u2019s narrow and bitter mind,\u201d she said. \u201cFine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il have had the run of this place for a century, and by Christ, they\u2019re not prepared to let go.\u201d McDonald said her party\u2019s breakthrough in the election \u2013 it won 24% of the vote, more than any other party \u2013 showed a desire for an alternative government that would build affordable homes, cut rents and reduce the pension age. Martin said he would ask Varadkar in coming days to engage in government formation talks, raising the possibility of an unprecedented coalition between Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, centrist rivals that have dominated Irish politics for a century. However, Fine Gael appears determined to go into opposition, saying it needs to regroup after nine years in office and a hammering from voters, raising doubts about any deal with Fianna Fail. Varadkar has also ruled out a deal with Sinn F\u00e9in. In the election, Fianna F\u00e1il won 38 seats, Sinn F\u00e9in won 37, Fine Gael 35 and the Greens 12, with small leftwing parties and independents sharing the rest. Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s slim advantage ended when one of its TDs (MPs), Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Feargha\u00edl, was re-elected as speaker, or Ceann Comhairle, whittling the party\u2019s voting bloc down to 37. Several left wing parties supported McDonald for taoiseach, underlining their preference for a left wing rainbow coalition. However, there is widespread acceptance that a stable government will require two of the three big parties. Some newly elected politicians made colourful arrivals. The re-elected brothers Michael and Danny Healy-Rae, independent TDs from Kerry, played traditional music on Kildare street. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 February 2020 to clarify that the Healy-Rae brothers were re-elected to the D\u00e1il."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
