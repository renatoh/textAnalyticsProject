The play's a mess'", "bodyText": "Thomas Ostermeier's production of Hamlet is a shambles \u2013 in the most literal sense. The lights have gone down in the Schaub\u00fchne in Berlin, and wine and food are flying around the theatre. Claudius's head sags drunkenly into his wedding breakfast. Hamlet writhes around in the soil that covers the stage; the next minute, he starts eating it. As he lopes towards the audience holding a beer can, the sharply dressed twentysomethings in the front row exchange a look of panic. I worry about his cleaning bills, I tell the director when I find him backstage. He laughs. \"What's more worrying is the cleaning bills for the audience. A woman approached me just now because she has blood on her clothes.\" He makes a show of looking apologetic. Ostermeier's Hamlet is certainly disconcerting. Ophelia and Gertrude are played by the same actor (there are just six performers in all), and the gravedigger scene is acted in dumb show right at the beginning, to a roaring track by Godspeed You! Black Emperor. At one point, Lars Eidinger's fat-suited, perspiring hero seizes a microphone and begins rapping, urging the audience to sing along; later, he dons suspenders to perform the play-within-a-play. You spend the evening waiting for him to pick up Yorick's skull. That moment never comes. If this sounds like European avant-garde theatre at its most off-puttingly modish, the effect is in fact kookily funny and coolly self-aware. Even though I'm watching without surtitles (these will feature when Hamlet arrives in Britain later this month), the play's themes could hardly be clearer. Hamlet's madness is violent, childlike; the mess and mud on stage reflect his obsession with death and decay. (\"There are so many reasons why the dirt and the earth make sense,\" explains Ostermeier. \"It's a playground, it's a cemetery, Old Hamlet's grave.\") At 43, Ostermeier still has something of the enfant terrible about him, even if the boyish pudginess of his face is less obvious than it once was. As a young director at Berlin's tiny Baracke theatre, he earned a reputation for staging contemporary plays in ferociously in-your-face productions, announcing that he was after scripts that would deal \"in the most unadorned way with such subjects as drugs, criminality, sex and power\". Deriding German writers for producing \"art crap\", he often chose work by British playwrights: David Harrower's Knives in Hens (1997), Mark Ravenhill's Shopping and Fucking (1998), a version of Enda Walsh's Disco Pigs (1999). Adding to the venue's rock'n'roll reputation, Ostermeier also occasionally played bass there with his own band. He developed a particularly intense working relationship with Sarah Kane; they met in 1997, and he toured his production of Zerbombt (Blasted) to the UK in 2006. \"There is a lot of Sarah Kane in everything I do,\" he says. \"A lot of my understanding of theatre comes from meeting these writers. Sarah herself put [Georg B\u00fcchner's] Woyzeck on stage before she committed suicide. She was very much attracted to [East German playwright] Heiner M\u00fcller, she was drawn to German classics.\" Ostermeier was just 29 when he got the job of running the Schaub\u00fchne. It was a watershed moment: had the theatre's board put a young Turk in charge, or \u2013 as some critics complained \u2013 unleashed a barbarian at the gates? Few German theatres have the symbolic resonance of this space. Founded in 1962, and now housed in a converted Bauhaus cinema in the smart neighbourhood of Charlottenburg, the Schaub\u00fchne developed a reputation for political drama (in much the same way that London's Royal Court, slap-bang in the middle of Chelsea, became the home of Britain's kitchen-sink playwrights). Run by Peter Stein for many years, it is also the theatre where Luc Bondy and Robert Wilson made their reputations. Ostermeier, however, had little time for the Schaub\u00fchne's heritage \u2013 or, at first, its audience. Critics were hostile about his attempts to bring a flavour of the Baracke (and some of its productions) into such a hallowed space; one doubted whether he was even capable of directing the \"classic texts \u2026 staged with an encyclopedic background and superior taste\" that were expected. He shrugs. \"They didn't like what we did. But it was not done for them. When I go to other theatres in Germany, I see some directors putting DJs on stage, references to contemporary art. But then I sit with these 55, 65-year-olds and you know they cannot read this.\" It's difficult to imagine a British director being so frank. Wouldn't it be better to try and evolve his audience gradually? \"Then you die. They were 60, 70. If we had gone on with that, they would be 80, 85, 90, now.\" On the Friday evening I visit, the theatre is teeming: the tiny cafe is packed, and there is not an empty seat in the auditorium. Strikingly, the audience for Hamlet is one of the youngest I can remember seeing, certainly for Shakespeare. Ticket sales, Ostermeier says, average 95%. \"This is not our worry,\" he remarks. \"Our worry is that we don't know when to put all our shows on.\" But if his audience is getting younger, the playwrights Ostermeier directs are getting deader. He once claimed he wouldn't do Shakespeare until he was 40, but in the last decade has become increasingly obsessed with classics: Ibsen, B\u00fcchner, Fassbinder and, yes, Shakespeare. Is the bad boy of German theatre softening? He thinks for a second. \"The anger, the desperation, the longing for beauty, the longing for another world \u2013 that's in Shakespeare, but it's also in B\u00fcchner and Edward Bond and Sarah Kane.\" He grins. \"I'm not saying that classical drama is now the thing for me. But I'm a bit pissed off by the fact that everybody in Germany is now doing contemporary plays. I'm sure I don't want to be part of a movement where everybody does the same.\" At any rate, it would be tough to classify his revivals as heritage theatre. His version of A Doll's House shocked many British critics in 2004 because it ended not with Nora slamming the door behind her, but with her pulling a gun on her husband; his Hedda Gabler, which arrived here four years later, presented the heroine as a bored, sulky child rather than a proto-feminist straining at the leash. Ostermeier's Othello (2010) is yet more daringly staged: the first scenes take place in an enormous water tank, the actors sloshing about ankle-deep. He doesn't even think Hamlet is a particularly good play. \"Dramaturgically, it's a complete mess. It's much too long, too many plots. It's not a well-made play. It's the worst-made play. But genius.\" Germany has long specialised in this kind of high-concept directors' theatre; few British directors get the budget, still less the opportunity to hone productions over time (Hamlet has been touring for three years, on and off). Ostermeier agrees. \"There is only one important difference: we have much more money than you.\" Is that always a good thing? \"Europe should have a different answer to Anglo-Saxon countries,\" he fires back. \"You will not find a sponsor [for performing arts] in Germany, because you cannot hang it on the wall and sell it in 10 years' time.\" Ostermeier is as damning as you would expect about the economic legacy of Thatcher and Blair, and impatient with the idea of private funding (the Schaub\u00fchne has none). He's also disconcertingly passionate about tax (\"it's a pretty beautiful and civilised idea\"). Berlin's culture budget is famously gargantuan: roughly \u20ac915m (\u00a3783m) for this one city alone, far outstripping Arts Council England's annual budget (\u00a3573m for 2011/12) and dwarfing the US's entire National Endowment for the Arts, likely to be $155m (\u00a397m) next year. Can the city really continue to afford five major state-funded theatres? He shrugs. \"I don't know. It's another reason why I stay here.\" His Schaub\u00fchne contract runs until 2015, although he continues to direct elsewhere as well. He is currently rehearsing Strindberg's Miss Julie in Moscow, before bringing Hamlet to London. There is a lot of bleakness in the work he directs, I say; a lot of emptiness and despair. Is he always this dark? He seems, for the first time, worried. \"Yes, there is this despair, but there is this one thing that makes life supportable \u2013 ertr\u00e4glich, bearable \u2013 and that's humour. Beckett's funny, Kane is funny. That's the kind of humour I like.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
