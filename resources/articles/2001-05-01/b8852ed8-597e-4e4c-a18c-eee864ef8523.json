It adds up to a week of such intensity that the Lindsays can boast a full house on a wet Tuesday afternoon, absorbed in the complexities of Berg's Op 3 Quartet, which was played with sinuous yet sublimely poetic rigour. It's the kind of event that allows all involved to extend their creative muscles. Pianist David Owen Norris is in no sense a singer, but he does not let that technicality deter him. In one of the most bizarre curtain-raisers ever devised, Norris proffers a view of both sides of Wilhelm Grosz, a Viennese composer who fled Nazi persecution and resettled as a hit songwriter in Hollywood. First Norris breezes through the Sonata Op 21, a wilful piece of pastoral anarchy that sounds like Vaughn Williams behaving badly; then he croons his own rendition of Grosz's greatest hit, Red Sails in the Sunset, inviting the audience to join him in the choruses. It encapsulates the spirit of this most approachable of music festivals. The programme also enables you to ponder what it might be like to eavesdrop on a great tenor singing in the bath. We may never experience the Winterreise that Philip Langridge's plastic ducks get to hear, but his performance of Schubert's song cycle in the Crucible Studio was as close as anyone is likely to get. The recently redeveloped Crucible Studio, home of the festival for 18 years, now offers the near-ideal combination of drawing-room dimensions and a decent seating capacity. The proximity afforded by its in-the-round configuration is almost indecent. Not only does Langridge's Winterreise make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up; you can actually see the down on the singer's nape rising as well. David Owen Norris accompanied Langridge, and explained in a prefatory word that after hundreds of performances of this song-cycle together, rehearsing in the four-sided auditorium released aspects of the piece that they had never discovered before. Langridge tapped in to the wonder of having somewhere to wander - his intense performance became a physical as well as an emotional journey, prowling around his pianist in ever decreasing circles. \u0095 The festival continues until Saturday.
