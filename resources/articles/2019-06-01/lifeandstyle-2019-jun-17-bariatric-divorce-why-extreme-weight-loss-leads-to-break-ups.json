It was at one of these classes that Williams, now 44, was first told that many married patients will divorce within years of the surgery. He turned to look at his wife, Desiree, who had trundled him into the meeting using the portable wheelchair they kept in the boot of their car. Williams couldn\u2019t walk more than a few feet \u2013 at his heaviest, he weighed 587lbs (266kg) \u2013 and he spent nearly all his time at home, being cared for by Desiree. He knew then that their marriage was over. \u201cI remember just looking at her thinking, that\u2019s going to be us. Because we\u2019re already rocky as it is,\u201d says Williams. Two months after the surgery, Desiree was gone. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even got the stitches healed.\u201d A successful YouTuber, Williams is known for the gaming vlogs he uploads as Boogie2988 from his home in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Since having the surgery, Williams has lost nearly a third of his body weight, and now weighs 340lbs (154kg). Would Williams have had the surgery if he had known it would cost him his marriage? Absolutely, he says. \u201cIt was an easy choice. My doctor basically sat me down and said: \u2018Steve, if we don\u2019t do this, you are going to die.\u2019\u201d But even aside from the health benefits, he would still have gone ahead \u2013 for Desiree. \u201cI would do it again just to give her that freedom and the option to end our codependent relationship, because it wasn\u2019t working. I just wanted her to be happy.\u201d The statistic that made such an impression on Williams came from a 2018 study. That found, of nearly 1,000 obese patients in relationships who had had bariatric surgery, 9% had divorced or separated within four years of their surgery, compared with 6% in a control group. Patients who were single prior to their surgery were more likely to find love afterwards. Out of nearly 1,000 single patients, 21% got married or started a relationship within four years, compared with 11% of those who didn\u2019t have the procedure. The study also reported an association between the degree of weight loss and the possibility of finding a partner. \u201cMany people who have undergone this treatment describe it as a strong, almost life-changing event,\u201d says Prof Per-Arne Svensson of the University of Gothenburg, who led the research. \u201cMany things apart from just the kilos are affected: how they socialise with people, how they become more socially active.\u201d This was the case for Gary Cupid, 35, a facilities manager from Hackney, east London. After having a mini gastric bypass in June 2017, Cupid lost 108lb (49kg). As the weight fell off, he started working out and making friends. His confidence grew, but his relationship foundered. His fiancee ended their engagement, two months after the surgery. \u201cI think she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the friendships I\u2019d gained ... she felt that I\u2019d become a different person.\u201d It\u2019s not just how you feel about yourself that changes after dramatic weight loss. Society treats you differently, too. \u201cA lot of these people have been obese for many years, or even their whole life,\u201d says Svensson. \u201cSuddenly, they lose the weight, and people start noticing them.\u201d Patients used to being invisible suddenly find themselves to be a desirable sexual and romantic proposition. \u201c\u2018Invisible\u2019 is the best way to describe it,\u201d says Chloe (not her real name), 34, a therapist from Shropshire. After she had a gastric sleeve fitted, she went from a size 28 to a 14. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how differently I was treated to everyone else until I was treated like everyone else. I thought it was me personally that repelled people, and that\u2019s why strangers wouldn\u2019t make eye contact with me.\u201d Chloe didn\u2019t feel deserving of love when she was obese. \u201cI didn\u2019t really feel like I had a choice. I felt like if somebody who wanted a relationship with me came along, I had to take it with both hands and run with it.\u201d She married her husband young; they are now separated. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have got married,\u201d she says. \u201cI got married because \u2013 there\u2019s no other way of putting this \u2013 he was willing.\u201d Their marriage foundered, in part due to his low sex drive, which she attributed to her weight. When you feel invisible, you take what love you can get \u2013 even if it\u2019s not healthy. \u201cWestern culture has a fascination with thinness as being one of our most pronounced markers of beauty and attractiveness,\u201d says Dr David Sarwer of the Center for Obesity Research and Education at Temple University. \u201cFor people with extreme obesity, the message is, if you\u2019re not thin, lean and toned, physical attraction, romance and sexuality is not for you.\u201d Following surgery, Chloe\u2019s self-esteem slowly improved, but her husband became resentful, she says. \u201cHe got the air that I was leaving him behind.\u201d One day they had an argument. Chloe was still recovering from surgery, but her husband refused to help prepare for a party, and she realised how toxic her marriage had become. \u201cI gained the confidence to see that I didn\u2019t need to be treated that way any more.\u201d The kind of clarity that Chloe experienced is not uncommon. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bariatric surgery seems to be compromising healthy marriages, but rather it seems like it\u2019s helping people get out of unhealthy relationships,\u201d says Sarwer. \u201cImagine the scenario in which someone entered into the relationship with low self-esteem and self-worth. They underwent surgery and started feeling better about themselves, and they decided: \u2018You know what? I can do better in terms of my romantic relationships.\u2019\u201d Not all relationships that end after bariatric surgery are toxic. Being with a morbidly obese person may mean becoming their caregiver; some marriages struggle to withstand that burden. \u201cIf people are struggling with significant medical complications, that can be very threatening to a romantic relationship,\u201d says Sarwer. Desiree helped Williams wash, did the shopping and drove him to doctor\u2019s appointments. \u201cShe was exhausted, because she was both the caretaker of the home and my caretaker. She had to do literally everything.\u201d After Williams\u2019 surgery, he says Desiree said: \u201cI feel like a weight has been lifted off me \u2013 I don\u2019t feel anxious, I\u2019m not angry, I feel like myself again.\u201d Patients, though, can wake up on the operating table as if born anew. \u201cHaving surgery was the turning point in my life,\u201d says Kelly Graham, 38, a team leader from Bedfordshire. \u201cAnd my relationship was the biggest thing I needed to deal with.\u201d Worried about complications, Graham\u2019s wife didn\u2019t want her to have the surgery \u2013 \u201cShe joked: \u2018You\u2019ll have to do it when I\u2019m not in the country\u2019\u201d \u2013 so Graham had a gastric sleeve fitted in June 2018 while her wife was on holiday. Afterwards, Graham realised her marriage had been floundering for years. \u201cI was too busy being miserable about my weight \u2013 that took over my life, more so than dealing with my relationship. But once I had the surgery and I started losing weight and feeling better about myself, I addressed the relationship.\u201d They separated this year, after three years of marriage. It\u2019s not only romantic relationships that are transformed by bariatric surgery. Many patients lose friends. Aisha Walker, 43, from Kent, had a mini gastric bypass in March 2017. Within a month, Walker, who runs the Gastric Guru support group, had lost some of her best friends. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the friend who just sat in the corner and said yes all the time. I gained my own spirit, and that made them feel uncomfortable.\u201d Walker says one fitness-conscious friend felt like she had taken the \u201ceasy way out\u201d. Patients also end up having to recalibrate the most destructive partnership in their lives to date: their relationship with food. Chloe\u2019s eating habits had been \u201cterrible\u201d. \u201cHappy? Eat. Sad? Eat. Eating was every emotion.\u201d After her surgery, she couldn\u2019t manage more than a few mouthfuls. \u201cTaking away your ability to emotionally eat exposes the bits of you that you\u2019ve been hiding behind. You\u2019ve been hiding behind the fat.\u201d Chloe believes her marriage fell apart because she wasn\u2019t able to use food as a diversion from her unhappiness. \u201cYour coping mechanism is gone.\u201d In addition to having to adjust to life as a single man, Williams had to learn how to navigate the world in an entirely new body. \u201cI got down to the size I am now, where people treat you like a person again ... they make eye contact, they smile at you, and I\u2019m no longer invisible and grotesque. And it\u2019s shocking.\u201d He experienced dysmorphia as a result. \u201cI would look in the mirror and not even recognise myself.\u201d Such a rapid metamorphosis can trigger an identity crisis. \u201cBefore surgery, you don\u2019t really know who you are,\u201d Walker says. \u201cThen all of a sudden, you find your voice and you have to work out who you are. And you have to create this persona of who you want to be.\u201d When we think of weight loss surgery, we visualise its results. Rarely do we consider the emotional impacts. \u201cYou think all your problems will be solved by losing the weight,\u201d Cupid says. \u201cBut it goes a lot deeper than that.\u201d He found himself questioning whether he was really such a nice guy. He had made self-deprecating jokes, picked up friends from the airport. \u201cI thought to myself: was that just a show to fit in? Maybe I\u2019m not a nice person now I\u2019ve lost the weight.\u201d More research is needed to better understand the factors contributing to this observed increase in relationship breakdowns, but Svensson urges people preparing to undergo bariatric surgery to be prepared for the fall-out. \u201cA lot of people will have failed numerous times with diets before, and see [surgery] as a last chance to get a new life. They have a lot of expectations, but not the expectation that it might actually ruin a relationship.\u201d Patients need to be warned that \u201cthere are going to be a lot of changes, and it\u2019s not only going to be kilos\u201d. But with the end of extreme obesity, patients can rebuild their life from the ground up. They get to decide how they want it to be \u2013 and who they want to be in it. \u201cFor the first time in my life, I\u2019m filled with hope,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI feel like the best part of my life is just beginning.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
