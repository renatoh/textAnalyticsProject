A force of some 15,000 US and Iraqi troops are encircling Falluja and battling in the city, and commanders say their cordon is tight and fighters still inside have little chance of escape. Late this afternoon, a huge explosion sent a fireball into the sky in the Jolan district, a rebel stronghold in the north-west of the city, which US forces claimed they had taken control of. Tank Commander Captain Robert Bodisch told the news agency that \"tonnes\" of weapons had been found in the area, and that Iraqi forces would stay behind to take care of sensitive tasks such as clearing out mosques. At least 18 US troops and five Iraqi soldiers have been killed since the start of the Falluja assault on Monday, the US commander of the operation said today. Major General Richard Natonski, commander of the 1st Marine Division, said a further 69 American service personnel and 34 Iraqi soldiers have been wounded. He said the operation was \"ahead of schedule\". There is no official toll on civilians killed or injured in the assault of the city, home to 200,000 to 300,000 people. Earlier today, the US military revealed they had found an Iraqi taxi driver who had been imprisoned at a location in north-eastern Falluja. Major Francis Piccoli of the US marines said troops had found the man yesterday chained to a wall and malnourished. The man said he had been beaten during his capture 10 days ago and television footage showed him wrapped in a blanket, looking worn out. While US and Iraqi forces claimed successes in Falluja, insurgent attacks continued throughout Iraq today, with a car bomb explosion killing 17 people in Baghdad and violent outbursts occurring in the northern city of Mosul. The car bomb explosion in Baghdad hit near Saadoun Street at 11.30am local time (0830 GMT). Reporters at the scene, which is a densely populated commercial area including major hotels housing foreigners, saw bodies in the rubble, and severely injured people being taken away by local residents. Cars were completely destroyed and a nearby building collapsed in the attack, which just narrowly missed a US convoy that had passed seconds before. \"It is a tragedy, even non-Muslims would not do this to innocent people,\" said witness Zuhier Abbas, a former Iraqi soldier. In the northern city of Mosul, Reuters reported that large groups of insurgents were on the rampage, setting police stations ablaze, stealing weapons and firing into the street. It followed an attack on a group of Iraqi national guardsmen on a bridge in the city centre, which left five of them dead. Residents were fearful that the city was sliding into lawlessness. \"It's crazy, really, really crazy,\" Abdallah Fathi told the news agency after witnessing the attack on the police station. \"Yesterday, the city felt like hell, today it could be the same or worse.\" Reuters was also reporting that Mosul's governor had imposed a curfew on the city yesterday and said anyone crossing the five bridges over the Tigris would be shot dead. Meanwhile, US marines say they found three Iraqi hostages in the city of Qaim, in western Iraq, during a raid. The men, all contractors, were found handcuffed, blindfolded and locked in a room and had been captured a week ago. Six suspects were seized during the operation, along with weapons. Earlier this morning a car bomb exploded in Kirkuk near a convoy carrying the governor of northern Kirkuk, killing one bystander and injuring 14 people, including four policemen, according to the police captain, Salam Zangana. The blast took place near the al-Tabaqchali overpass in Kirkuk at 0530 GMT as the convoy of the governor, Abdul-Rahman Mustafa, drove by. Mr Zangana said the bomb was an assassination attempt on Mr Mustafa, who is Kurdish although Mr Mustafa was unharmed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
