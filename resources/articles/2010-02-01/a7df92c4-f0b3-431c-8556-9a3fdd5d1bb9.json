Britain's forces need a period of \"effective recuperation\" after operating at a rate well above official planning assumptions, the Commons defence committee said. \"The MoD was unable to tell us how long it would take before the armed forces return to satisfactory levels of readiness\", it added. It describes how RAF pilots were unable to train because aircraft were tied up on operations, the navy had too many commitments and major exercises had to be cancelled. The report also quotes Lt Gen Sir Graeme Lamb, a senior commander, as saying that his fellow senior officers believed the army needed to expand from around 102,000 troops to 112,000 to meet the demands placed on it. Meanwhile the defence secretary, Bob Ainsworth, told the committee that the plan to renew the Trident nuclear missile project would be excluded from the strategic defence review due to be set up after the general election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
