The money was given to about a dozen Second and Third Division clubs. \"We have never before lent as much money out; it has been well over \u00a31m,\" Taylor said. \"We do have serious problems at some lower-division clubs and we have been covering the wages for something like 12 this season.\" Taylor also said that with TV money likely to decrease, or at best stay the same, even more clubs would have to make adjustments in future. \"TV coverage is getting saturated but the clubs must see what income they are getting and cut their cloth accordingly.\" He added that the PFA was thus justified in threatening strike action when it was in dispute with the leagues over its share of television income. \"This shows the importance of what we were saying. In the 1980s the union helped the likes of Fulham, Charlton, Middlesbrough and Derby, who all had serious problems and are all in the Premiership now, so it proves to be, in general, a good policy.\" And responding to reports that as many as 900 of the 2,800 professional footballers might be dismissed in May, Taylor said: \"Something like 300 to 400 players are released by clubs every year and I am sure we will see that again.\" \u00b7 Ronaldo, the Internazionale striker who has had knee problems for two years, is named in Brazil's squad for the friendly with Yugoslavia on March 27. \u00b7 Nigeria, England's World Cup opponents on June 12, have omitted their captain Sunday Oliseh and Ipswich's Finidi George from a squad of 55 invited to begin preparing for South Korea and Japan. Among those included are Crystal Palace's Ade Akinbiyi and the Crewe players Dele Adebola and Efe Sodje. \u00b7 South Africa have asked their technical director Jomo Sono, 45, to lead them to the World Cup finals after the Portuguese coach Carlos Queiroz resigned, citing his unhappiness with having to report to Sono. \u00b7 Celtic are expected to give their youth development officer Tommy Burns the go-ahead to join the new Scotland coach Berti Vogts's back-room team. \u00b7 Svetoslav Todorov's \u00a3750,000 move from West Ham to Portsmouth is back, on subject to a medical, after the Home Office granted the 23-year-old Bulgarian a work permit. \u00b7 Mark Hughes will be offered a new contract by Blackburn. \"He is 38 but he is still prepared to give and take knocks,\" said the manager Graeme Souness. \"If he wants to play until he is 39 or 40, then I see no reason why he can't do that.\" \u00b7 Bolton have slammed the unnamed clubs who have circulated details of their intent to offload Dean Holdsworth, Gareth Farrelly and Rod Wallace. \"We are extremely disenchanted in the way they have acted in such an unprofessional manner,\" said Bolton's manager Sam Allardyce. \"A circular was sent to clubs stating that a number of players may be of interest, but no players have been placed on the official transfer list.\" \u00b7 Lazio's squad locked themselves into a dressing room for two hours yesterday after about 400 fans, still fuming at Sunday's 5-1 drubbing by Roma, stormed their Formello training ground. The fans continued to hurl abuse from behind a security cordon after police arrived."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
