The Wigan wing was a surprise inclusion in the squad announced by the Lancashire coach Paul Cullen yesterday. It confirms he is a genuine contender to make his Great Britain debut in the home series against Australia later this year. It is the latest twist in the 26-year-old's highly unusual career, which began while he was studying law in Dublin in 1998. He was spotted playing for the Ireland Students rugby league team by Shane Richardson, an Australian then looking for players for the new Gateshead Thunder club. \"I don't know much about the rivalry, but I'm sure once I get into camp with the lads this weekend I will get a feel for it,\" said Carney. He is one of five Wigan players in the Lancashire squad, including Paul Sculthorpe's younger brother Danny and the captain Andy Farrell. Leeds's 19-year-old prop Ryan Bailey has been included but Cullen and his Yorkshire counterpart Graham Steadman have largely stuck with tried and tested players. The Bradford forward Mike For shaw should make his Lancashire debut at the age of 33, almost two years after retiring from international rugby. Wigan's Australian wing Brett Dallas has opted to stay put for the rest of the season rather than join Cronulla Sharks. Yorkshire squad: Pryce (Bradford), Calderwood (Leeds), Ellis (Wakefield), Senior , Walker (both Leeds), Hodgson (Wigan), Pratt (Bradford), R Horne (Hull), Orr (Castleford, capt), Diskin (Leeds), Hudson (Castleford), Anderson (Bradford), Bailey (Leeds), Lynch (Castleford), Peacock (Bradford), Harland (Castleford), Gilmour (Bradford). Lancashire: Prescott (Hull), Connolly (Leeds), Wellens (St Helens), Carney (Wigan), Gleeson (St Helens), Johnson (Wigan), Long (St Helens), Deacon (Bradford), Cunningham (St Helens), Newton (Wigan), Hilton (Warrington), D Sculthorpe (Wigan), McDermott (Leeds), Forshaw (Bradford), Farrell (Wigan, capt), Sinfield (Leeds), P Sculthorpe (St Helens)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
