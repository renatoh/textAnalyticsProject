Jason Wright, from Swaton in Lincolnshire, said he initially faced eviction from his house in 2014 but was given a reprieve when the crown estate confirmed he had an \u201cassured tenancy\u201d, which meant he could stay on despite its sale. Wright, a pastor, said he was given the opportunity to buy the property but could not afford it and it was eventually sold to Dorrington Residential Ltd for about \u00a3250,000. The company, which made a \u00a39m pre-tax profit in its most recent accounts, raised the rent by about 7% last year and 3% the year before that, according to Wright. In the last two years inflation has not risen above 2.8%, and in March 2019 it was recorded as 1.8%. Dorrington Residential purchased 50 rural residential properties from the crown estate in September 2015. \u201cSince then, Dorrington have begun to hike the rent up. We had a rent increase last year of about 7%, which is above inflation, which I argued about,\u201d said Wright. \u201cI guess this is going on across the country in properties which have been sold off to big conglomerates like Dorrington.\u201d Wright, who pays \u00a3555 a month in rent with his wife, said he is concerned he will never see back the estimated \u00a330,000 he has spent on renovations to the property, which he described as being \u201cderelict\u201d when they moved in. The 48-year-old, who campaigned against the crown estate evictions by setting up a petition, said: \u201cThey [the crown estate ] refused to reimburse me any of the money I\u2019d spent on the property although we were promised if it ever swapped hands there would be negotiations on reimbursement or if I ever left the house. So they washed their hands of what they owed me. \u201cWhen we moved in the house was derelict. I say derelict \u2013 I had to replaster the walls. There was no kitchen, there was just a sink. We did a lot of the property on the basis the rent would remain low and we\u2019d be able to stay there until we die.\u201d Wright said he has since been told by Dorrington that he needs to take up the issue with the crown estate, which, he said, was \u201cnot interested and basically said if you want to take it further, get a solicitor, but I\u2019m in no position to do that\u201d. After initially being helpful after buying the house, Wright said Dorrington had failed to adequately deal with a number of issues. \u201cThey\u2019ve been evasive, very difficult to get anyone to do anything.\u201d He said problems with the front door meant he was not able to lock it properly for a month. \u201cWe were unable to lock the door for four weeks so that meant that one door was, well, open. Only today [in May] has the glazier come out and said it needs a new door.\u201d A Dorrington spokesman said: \u201cUnder the terms of an assured tenancy the landlord is entitled to carry out an annual review and charge rent at a market level for the property in its current condition. \u201cIf the tenant does not accept the proposed new rent then they have the opportunity to refer the matter to the first-tier tribunal, which is part of HM Courts and Tribunals Service. The tribunal will rule on the fairness or otherwise of the proposed rent.\u201d He added: \u201cWe aim to respond to a repair request expeditiously and wherever possible to complete the necessary works within 14 days \u2026 We have no outstanding repairs at any of our former crown estate properties.\u201d A crown estate spokeswoman said: \u201cIn most cases where we are aware that tenants have chosen to undertake substantial improvements to a property, we have agreed from the outset an understanding of how these would be treated at the end of a tenancy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
