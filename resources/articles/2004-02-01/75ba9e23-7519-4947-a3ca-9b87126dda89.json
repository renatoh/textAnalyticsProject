John Edwards of North Carolina and John Kerry of Massachusetts both held up leads of 10% or more among likely voters in a Gallup poll commissioned jointly by CNN and the USA Today newspaper. 55% said they would choose Mr Kerry over Mr Bush, who drew the support of 43% of those questioned. Mr Edwards led the president 54% to 44%. The survey marks the first time Mr Edwards, a former trial lawyer, has beaten Mr Bush in an opinion poll. His campaign received an unexpected surge in the Wisconsin primary when he came a close second to Mr Kerry. He told his supporters: \"The voters of Wisconsin sent a clear message. The message was this: objects in your mirror may be closer than they appear.\" But doubts are mounting over whether Mr Edwards has enough money to see him through a head-to-head campaign against Mr Kerry, who mortgaged his house to raise the money to keep his campaign alive when he ran low on resources in December. To win the nomination, a candidate has to secure 2,162 delegates in the Democratic national convention. Mr Edwards has picked up 190 delegates in the primaries and caucuses so far, but Mr Kerry is far ahead with 611. The Edwards campaign needs to win at least two big states on March 2 - the so-called Super Tuesday when more than 1,500 delegates are up for grabs - and then keep going until the Illinois vote on March 16 to be in with a chance of beating Mr Kerry. He yesterday announced five days of campaigning in New York State and will also fight hard to win Georgia. The chairman of Mr Bush's re-election campaign told CNN that he was not surprised the poll had given both senators a clear lead over the president. \"There's been a huge focus on the Democratic primary, a lot of media coverage of those events ... huge amounts of money spent attacking the president,\" said Marc Racicot. \"We predicted that we were probably going to be in a position where we would be trailing for a period of time, so I think that we've known all along that this is going to be a tough race.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
