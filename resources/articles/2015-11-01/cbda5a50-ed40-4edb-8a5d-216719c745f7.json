We don\u2019t yet know how it\u2019ll take shape for series creator Tom Rob Smith, but after the beguiling, sedate blossoming of the love affair, the murky climax implied something altogether less convivial, with a heavy nod to the real-life \u201cspy in the suitcase\u201d. Some will have found this episode po-faced, ponderous, preening or plain daft. \u201cTheir importance emanates from them,\u201d says Scottie of Alex\u2019s sort, but he could have been referring to the sort of prestige BBC drama that specialises in gnomic dialogue and self-conscious camerawork. I found it cast a disturbing and seductive spell. As a mood piece, it inevitably meandered a little. But by the end there was a real narrative drive and purpose, and the central mystery gripped all the tighter for its sedate setting-up. I only hope the love affair \u2013 of a sort and style we see so little of on TV \u2013 isn\u2019t forgotten in the forthcoming twists and turns. Hollywood made a horrible job of Smith\u2019s Child 44. Let\u2019s see if the BBC can do any better. My hopes are high. What about yours? Danny: \u2018I must be easy to read\u2019 It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone other than Ben Whishaw pulling a character like this off (so to speak). Jittery, boyish, awkward, garrulous, melancholy, charismatic, needy, romantic \u2013 anything but \u201cfine\u201d. Of indeterminate age (late 20s, probably?), Danny works in an Amazonian distribution warehouse, lives in a huge but chaotic Vauxhall apartment-cum-bedsit with flatmates who seem nice enough, if a bit flaky, has enough of a local reputation to get him into crowded clubs and only seems to have one friend: Jim Broadbent\u2019s Scottie. He was also, we learn in Whishaw\u2019s harrowing and brilliantly performed monologue, subjected to a horrendous, prolonged assault some years back that left him deeply dependent on Scottie, concerned (understandably but unnecessarily, as it turned out) about having contracted HIV, and burdened with a fair few issues that a good, solid relationship with someone steady and reliable might help resolve. Enter Joe. Sorry, that\u2019s Alex. No, Alastair. Look, the credits call him Alex, so we\u2019ll stick with that for now. There\u2019s an instant spark despite Danny\u2019s chemically induced comedown, and Danny engineers another meeting. Gradually, they fumble their way towards knowing each other (or do they?), and into bed. Then Alex vanishes and Danny is mysteriously directed towards a house key hidden in the warehouse. He lets himself into Alex\u2019s flat and discovers a hidden sex dungeon where Alex has been stuffed in a trunk, very much dead. After starting to cover his tracks, he calls the police (who question him like he\u2019s a suspect rather than a witness). Danny\u2019s clearly being framed, but by whom and to what end? And what is it he discovers (and swallows) in the battery compartment of Alex\u2019s laptop? His speed of response suggests Danny isn\u2019t quite the vulnerable patsy his shadowy enemies might wish. There are, clearly, a lot of questions, and Danny\u2019s as much in the dark as the rest of us. It\u2019s very likely that the overriding theme will be how difficult it is to be honest with yourself, let alone others, whether you\u2019re a drifter or a spy. Alex: \u2018I\u2019ve been serious for a very long time.\u2019 Alex presents an altogether trickier challenge for Edward Holcroft. On the surface, there\u2019s little to do: Alex was an apparently simple soul, innocent, taciturn and unknowable going-on anonymous. Alastair, of course, was very different. Holcroft did his best, but I was more convinced by the chemistry than the characterisation. Does anyone in the real world talk or behave like this? Alex was, I presume, somewhere on the spectrum: all the narrative shorthand was there \u2013 \u201calways out of step\u201d, child prodigy at university by 15, good with numbers, bad with interaction. Which was the real man? Was Alex, the solemn, virginal orphan who worked for an investment bank, a complete fabrication? Or could Alastair, the MI6 agent with living parents and a penchant for hardcore S&amp;M (the bondage not stopping with Ben \u201cQ\u201d Whishaw or the opening credits, it seems), be a front? Or are they two sides of the same coin \u2013 a vulnerable man unable to find a partner who sought solace in anonymous sex? Was his love for Danny genuine? I think so. One thing is certain. If you like your orgies fastidious, he\u2019s your man. Or was, anyway. Scottie: \u201cDo you ever wonder what I might want?\u201d Something tells me Scottie is more than capable of getting what he wants when he puts his mind to it. He\u2019s a Whitehall wonk with a comfortable life about which we (again) know very little. But he\u2019s out and fond of Danny, although often exasperated by him. And that\u2019s your lot. Again, the casting sells it. Jim Broadbent is as twinkly and avuncular as always, but there\u2019s a steeliness, too, that makes you wish he was used more often as a villain. Remember Hot Fuzz, or Gangs of New York? Whether he\u2019s an out-and-out wrong\u2019un is up for debate, but his offhand question to Danny about pinching an item of \u201csentimental value\u201d was loaded with menace. What\u2019s more, his interrogation of Alex on their \u201cfirst\u201d meeting (I suspect he\u2019s not being entirely honest when he tells Danny he just knows Alex\u2019s \u201ctype\u201d) teetered into aggression and humiliated Danny in the process. Not that Danny isn\u2019t capable of viciousness, too \u2013 as demonstrated at Scottie\u2019s place \u2013 but for Danny, it\u2019s instinctive rather than calculated. Has their relationship always been chaste and generous, or are charge and mentor playing a power game? Scottie seems to hold the cards. His wrangling of a lawyer might just as much have been a display of dominance as of protectiveness. London Director Jakob Verbruggen worked on both The Bridge and The Fall, and brings some of the same sense of alienation, paranoia and downright otherness as he did to Copenhagen, Malmo and Belfast. Whether close-up or panorama, claustrophobia infused the camerawork even when the old CCTV trick wasn\u2019t being rolled out. The strolls on the South Bank involved precious few tourist landmarks, thank goodness, and the sun stayed stubbornly behind the clouds until emerging post-coitally, albeit fleetingly. Some beautifully framed interiors, too \u2013 Alex and Danny in Danny\u2019s bathroom; the sex; the louche modernism of Scottie\u2019s flat; the attic. There was something inevitably Rear Window-ish about Danny\u2019s courtyard, especially in the cigarette butts on the other side \u2013 was this the smoker puffing away in the van outside Alex\u2019s apartment? And that attic. A masterclass in slow-burn suspense. The production design here was stunning, even if putting the drug paraphernalia in a bloody music box might have been overkill on the creepiness front. Smith has posited it as the visualisation of a gay man\u2019s worst fears: what brings pleasure can also bring death. Whether or not you buy into that, it\u2019s still a hell of a dramatic coup. A word, too, for the wonderful music from another Bond veteran, David Holmes, and Keefus Ciancia. That drag geisha lullaby was very Lynchian, while the gathering sense of dread after Alex falls off the radar is intensified by the throbbing soundtrack. Notes and observations The juxtaposition and interaction of Vauxhall\u2019s two demimondes \u2013 gay village and hub of espionage \u2013 is narrative gold. I\u2019m not sure Whishaw\u2019s been this badly treated on screen since he played Pingu. Will Danny\u2019s flatmates remain shiftless cyphers or prove their worth? \u201cThat would have been the reason you were selected. The appearance of innocence.\u201d Even for a strange man, this was a strange thing for Alex to say to Danny. TV and film still haven\u2019t quite figured out how to \u201cdo\u201d computers without making it a bit cheesy (see the peculiar algorithms and encryption graphics on Alex\u2019s laptop). Who directed Danny to the keys to Alex\u2019s flat? Alex himself, or the people attempting to frame him? Where was Danny being interviewed? Surely police stations don\u2019t look like that, even in heavily stylised BBC dramas. Is Danny an entirely reliable observer? Could some of what we see just be taking place in his head? Nice segue from the beach to the bed, there, or from groynes to groins. Eight months passed between Danny and Alex getting together and Scottie meeting Alex. It\u2019s quite the gaping hole to leave in a narrative: will we ever find out what happened? Tom Rob Smith\u2019s partner is former BBC head of drama commissioning Ben Stephenson, fact fans. The supporting cast is really something. We still have Mark Gatiss, Adrian Lester, Charlotte Rampling, Harriet Walter, Clarke Peters all to come, plus a cheeky cameo for Chewing Gum\u2019s brilliant Michaela Coel \u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
