United are just showboating now, keeping possession while the crowd roar \"Ole!\" at each pass. The referee puts Deportivo out of their misery and blows for full time. Manchester United win a very entertaining match 2-0 in front of over 67,000 punters at Old Trafford. Despite several near misses and close calls for which they could easily have been punished, they won it easily in the end. I'd love to stay and chat, but if I don't get to the jacks soon my kidneys will explode. Thanks for your time and your mails, see you in February and have a great Christmas and a happy New Year. Yes, even you Mr Stephen \"Your commentary resembles that of a jackass\" Lubofsky. 88 mins: Who's this young whelp? Ciaran/Kieren Richardson comes on for Ruud van Nistelrooy. He looks like a young Paul Ince, except with less fuzzy hair and he looks about 12. With a name like that, I'm cautiously optimistic he's Irish. Scholes intercepts a Victor pass in midfield and sends Beckham on his way. He tries and fails to find Richardson with an ambitious cross-field pass. 86 mins: Deportivo's enthusiasm for this game seems to be fizzling out a bit. Mine too. Nature isn't so much calling as screaming at me, so if there's a particularly long pause soon, you'll know why. Fuidz in Australia hasn't mailed in about Boydo's exploits in a Waterford kitchen, although I was expecting him to. Fuidz is a pal of mine who I'll be meeting in London for a curry and a clatter of pints on February 17th, if anyone's interested in joining us. 84 mins: Could some kind soul please tell me where/how you can hear these matches on the Net, so that I can forward the information on to a Sean Moore, who really wants to know. It's almost as if my commentary isn't informative enough. Warning: Reading or listening to commentaries that aren't from GU makes you blind. And stunts your growth. Fact. 82 mins: A dangerous Beckham cross is headed clear by Acuna. 81 mins: David Beckham and Diego Forlan come on in place of Gary Neville and John O'Shea. Ryan Giggs goes in at left back. Ryan Giggs? 78 mins: \"Is it because Silvestre should have been at centre back all along that Man United won nothing last season? Or is that over-simplifying it?\" asks Julien Allen, seemingly oblivious to the fact that I'm really not the man to answer questions like that. I'm just grateful they won nothing, to be honest, so mine isn't to reason why. Van Nistelrooy goes down in the box again, this time under a Scaloni \"challenge\". It looked like he was chancing his arm to me. The ref awards nothing. 76 mins: Manchester United win a free on the right-hand side of the Deportivo box. Giggs whips it in and Juanmi saves well. Could everyone please stop comparing my commentary to what is actually happening in the match. I can assure you you'll find no end of discrepancies if you look hard enough. Ruud van Nistelrooy goes down in the box but gets no penalty. My first impression is that Cesar didn't foul him. 73 mins: My thanks to the many millions of people who have mailed in to tell me that van Nistelrooy's first-half \"goal\" was disallowed because he had his hand over Juanmi's eye when they both jumped for the ball. And your collective point is? Back in my day, you could bundle the 'keeper-and-ball into the back of the net and the goal would stand. Now they're treated like an endangered species. Deportivo substitution: Luque comes on for ... eh ... I'm sorry I haven't a clue. 71 mins: Silvestre goes down injured after clashing heads with Sergio. the physio runs on with the magic sponge and the Frenchman is okay to continue. 70 mins: Victor tries to get a cross in from the left, but Gary Neville is having none of it. He puts it out for a throw. Much as it pains me to say it, he's playing very well. 69 mins: Not a great deal going on at the moment, to be honest. I'm just typing this to fill the dead air, as it were. 66 mins: Deportivo go forward through Victor. He gives the ball away and it's rolled back towards Barthez, who launches a bomb up towards Paul Scholes. 64 mins: The not 100% fit Valeron The Playmaker is taken off and replaced by Acuna, who I think is from Paraguay and is known as El Torro (The Bull - and there's plenty of that being spouted here, according to Stephen Lubofsky). He slots in behind Tristan. 63 mins: Giggs is pushed off balance while attempting a shot on goal. It's wide. 59 mins: \"Your on-line commentary resembles that of a total jack-ass,\" writes Stephen Lubofsky, rather pompously. \"Why can't you keep your ludicrous comments to yourself.\" Because Stephen, if I kept them to myself it wouldn't be a commentary. Would it? 58 mins: On the bench, the United subs are creasing themselves laughing after watching Gary Neville slot the ball wide after being set up for a one-on-one with Juanmi courtesy of a lovely touch from Veron. If it was anyone else, you'd say it was a missed sitter. 54 mins: GOAL: Manchester United 2 - 0 Deportivo La Coruna Giggs stings Juanmi's palms with a fierce shot. Solskjaer attempts to hook the ball into the net from an impossible angle, and the ball ends up squirting into the path of the on-rushing Ruud van Nistelrooy. He almost bursts the net with a thunderbolt from close range. This one stands. 51 mins: Van Nistelrooy gets the ball into the net on his second attempt. Offside. At the far end of the field, Barthez saved well at his near post from Roy Makaay. 49 mins: Rob Hisnay is very upset that I haven't put up a picture of Sir Alex, so I'm happy to oblige. Scholes threads a through-ball into the Deportivo box and finds van Nistelrooy. With only the 'keeper to beat, he shoots straight at him. Juanmi can't hold it and a defender clears up before Solskjaer can bury the rebound. United could pay dearly for their assorted misses. 45 mins: Deportivo kick off. Tristan is on for the Spanish side and immediately links up well with Valeron The Playmaker. Silvestre and O'Shea do well to clear. I have no idea who is gone off, but my money's on Amavisca, who had a very quiet first half. \"I'm listening to the game over the Internet so I was wondering about your thoughts concerning Sandinista - the three-album epic that still holds its own against such other great triple albums as Yessongs and Focus III?\" writes Alan from Arkansas. Sandinista was a big mistake in my opinion, Alan. But even The Who's Pete Townshend has a perverse rock opera fetish. Such musical gods have to be allowed their little indulgences. \"I agree. The Clash were the greatest band of all time,\" writes Alex. Two minutes later, he writes again: \"Or should that read, are the greatest band of all time.\" Either way, I know what you mean, Alex. Rolf From Sweden is back, which is a relief. I hadn't heard from him in weeks and was getting quite worried about him, to be honest. Rolf has very kindly written the first 1000 words of Daniel Hoyle's 2000-worder on The Problems Of Reading Attached to Emotional Identification (15 mins). Danny, I've no idea whether it's any good or not, but I've forwarded same to your e-mail address. 45 mins: Half-time. United go in for their tea and orange segments with a one-goal lead. they've been the better team and have had the lion's share of the chances, but still managed to look spectacularly unconvincing faced by the aerial threat of Cesar and Makaay. Having said that, the home side should really be 3-0 up. 43 mins: Valeron The Playmaker brings a save out of Barthez, which the Frenchman can't hang on to. Silvestre helps him mop up by Heskeying the ball out for a throw-in. 40 mins: \"Dear Barry,\" begins Stephen McCabe with the kind of politeness we're not used to here at GU. \"As I read your commentary, and listen to the game via United's web site, there's a strange convergence of commentary - they also describe Ruud's leap with a fish metaphor (or salmon simile). Which begs the question - are you actually there?! Actually it begs the question, how fish-like was it?\" No, I'm not there Stephen and it was quite piscine. As opposed to gazelle-like, which is the other over-used simile I have in my sparsely filled box of descriptions labelled \"Headed Goals\". 39 mins: A clumsy tackle from Veron goes unpunished. He's lucky. He could have got his second yellow card there. 38 mins: John O'Shea goes on the rampage up the left wing, nutmegs Sergio and his attempt to cut the ball back from the byline is blocked. A superb run by the big man from Waterford. 33 mins: Wes Brown isn't having the game of his life tonight. He intercepts a through-ball from Sergio on the edge of the box, but then lets Makaay rob him. To his credit, however, he pursues the pacy Deportivo frontman doggedly and wins the ball back. 32 mins: Valeron The Playmaker slips a ball through to Amavisca, which Gary Neville promptly dispatches to the Manchester Ship Canal with a great tackle. 28 mins: Deportivo win a corner. It's crossed in towards Cesar but Silvestre clears. Veron tackles Amavisca well and is bookedvery unjustly. I want to see Manchester United lose as much as the next right-thinking man, but this referee is a pompous clown. 27 mins: Van Nistelrooy has what looks like a perfectly good goal disallowed. He jumps with the keeper and heads it home. However, because he was standing within 10 yards of the Deportivo keeper when they both jumped, the ref had no choice but to disallow it. Because that's what referees do. 26 mins: Solskjaer latches on to a fantastic cross-field ball from Silvestre and crosses to the near post. Van Nistelrooy beats his marker to it, gets his big equine head on it (see above right) and puts it wide. Bad miss. 22 mins: From a corner, Cesar gets his second free header of the game. It goes harmlessly wide. Wes Brown, I believe, is the man who'll be getting what little hair he has dried by the Sir Gaffer at half-time. 19 mins: A brilliant cross-field ball finds Sergio, whose cross is crucially cut out by Barthez. United counter and Giggs crosses from the left, low and hard, teeing the ball up for Scholes. He connects and misses an absolute sitter. An effort you'd expect him to bury 99 times out of 100 goes left and wide. On the sideline, Sir Alex buries his head in his hands. 18 mins: Valeron The Playmaker spoons a ball into the box, which Roy Makaay controls well. Under pressure, he crosses to Amavisca, but Gary Neville heads clear. Deportiva are starting to look like the home team. 15 mins: Daniel Hoyle writes: \"Any chance you want to swap lives for the night and I'll watch the match, commenting on its ebbs and flows in a slightly witty manner, whilst you write a 2000 word essay on the problems of reading attached to emotional identification?\" he enquires. No thanks, Dan, although I'm slightly puzzled by your use of the phrase \"slightly witty\". I'm very witty. Modest too. Of course, no sooner had I commented on Manchester United's complete dominance than Deportivo started raising their game. Valeron and Mauro Silva are looking particularly lively, now that they've woken up. 13 mins: Wes Brown wellies a Mauro Silva effort out for a corner. Manchester United clear. 12 mins: Manchester United are absolutely crucifying Deportivo at the moment. Seconds after scoring, Van Nistelrooy brought another good save out of Juanmi in the Deportivo goal. 6 mins: GOAL Manchester United 1 - 0 Deportivo La CorunaTo quote the greatest band of all time, The Clash, Ruudi can't fail at the moment. A peach of a header from Van Nistelrooy. A cross from Scholes on the right hand side of the box hung temptingly above his head, he rose like a salmon between two defenders and nodded it home from just outside the six yard box. A great goal. 4 mins: Juanmi is Deportivo's second choice stopper. Their first choice, whose name escapes me at the moment (actually, I haven't a clue who he is, to be honest) is ill with testicular cancer. Here's hoping he gets well soon, whoever he is. Solskjaer scurries into the Deportivo box with the ball on his toe. Capdevilla hacks it clear. 3 mins: On the edge of the Deportivo box, Solskjaer and Van Nistelrooy combine with a neat little one-two. The Dutchman shoots and as the ball arrows towards the top left-hand corner, Juanmi saves acrobatically. It's all Manchester United so far. So it is. 2 mins: Phil Neville finds Solskjaer on the edge of the Deportivo box, and Juanmi rushes out to clear it into Row Z. 1 min: Ruud 'n' Ollie kick off for Manchester United. They're playing from left to right, away from the Stretford End. An early ball is hoofed towards van Nistelrooy but, on the edge of the box with the ball looping in over his left shoulder, his control lets him down. I'd have volleyed it from there myself. The teams: Manchester United: 1-Fabien Barthez; 2-Gary Neville, 24-Wes Brown, 27-Mikael Silvestre, 22-John O'Shea; 20-Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, 3-Phil Neville, 4-Juan Sebastian Veron, 11-Ryan Giggs; 18-Paul Scholes, 10-Ruud van Nistelrooy Deportivo Coruna: 25-Juanmi; 12-Lionel Scaloni, 3-Enrique Romero, 5-Cesar, 15-Joan Capdevila; 18-Victor, 16-Sergio, 21-Juan Carlos Valeron, 6-Mauro Silva, 11-Jose Emilio Amavisca; 7-Roy Makaay Referee: Terje Hauge (Norway) Kick-off: 7.45pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
