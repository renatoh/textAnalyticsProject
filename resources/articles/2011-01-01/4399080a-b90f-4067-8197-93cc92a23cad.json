I just want to serve people.\" Lord Taylor of Warwick was visibly upset as the jury was shown a video about his charity, the Warwick Leadership Foundation, set up to empower young people. He removed his glasses to wipe tears from his eyes as the film, which included tributes from people who had been involved with the foundation and references to his rise to the House of Lords, was played. He then reacted angrily to his first question from Mohammed Khamisa QC, defending, who said: \"Have you ever done anything dishonest?\" Taylor pounded his fist on the table and shouted: \"No, I haven't. I don't want to make money. I just want to serve people. That is all I care about ... Some millionaires in the House of Lords are some of the most miserable people I have ever met.\" He continued: \"Money doesn't bring you anything. It's serving people that does. Those young people there, that is what counts.\" Following his outburst, Taylor said: \"My lord, I would like to apologise.\" The judge, Mr Justice Saunders, replied: \"No, there's no need.\" Taylor, accused of claiming for travel costs between a family member's home in Oxford and the House of Lords, when he actually lived in London, told Southwark crown court that he viewed the system as being \"in lieu of salary\". He said he had acted on advice from Lord Colwyn in 2003 that he should state his address as being outside of London. \"He said it was perfectly acceptable, but he did stress you have to have a family connection,\" said Taylor. Taylor, who resigned the Conservative whip, said: \"It was in lieu of salary because there was no realistic prospect \u2013 because of the image of the House of Lords \u2013 of lords being paid. \"The policy was to claim the maximum because the reality is, in terms of expenditure, you were spending far more than you were able to claim back.\" He told the court he was offered a peerage by the then prime minister, John Major in 1996 after narrowly missing out on a Commons seat in 1992, and that he had learned to tolerate constant racial abuse. He took a significant pay cut when he entered the House of Lords, he said. His lawyer's salary, which was \u00a3100,000, had \"dropped alarmingly\" to \u00a350,000 when he spent most of his time on his parliamentary duties. Khamisa asked Taylor about his relationship with his half nephew Robert Taylor, who lives in the house in Oxford the peer claimed was his home outside of London. He stated that they had a good relationship and confided in each other over personal matters and that Robert was the first person to congratulate him on taking a seat in the House of Lords. Asked if he had told his relative he had used his address on his claim forms, the peer said: \"Not in that context, no. I think in retrospect I should have done.\" Earlier in the trial, Robert Taylor said he was \"shocked\" and \"quite angry\" when he found out his address had been used. Khamisa asked Lord Taylor how he felt about his relative being \"doorstepped\" after becoming the focus of a news story. He replied: \"I feel extremely sad and remorseful about that.\" Earlier, the court heard character evidence from Harvey Thomas, who was press and public relations director for Margaret Thatcher during her time as prime minister. Thomas described Taylor as \"possibly a little too trusting and possibly not pushy enough\". He added: \"He was a very trusting individual. If I would call and say something, I wouldn't expect him to question it at all.\" Lord Taylor, 58, is facing six allegations of false accounting on various dates between March 2006 and October 2007. The prosecution says he wrongly claimed for travel as well as night subsistence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
