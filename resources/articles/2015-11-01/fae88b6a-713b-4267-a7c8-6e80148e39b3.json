Nicholas Hoult has a certain shark-like charisma as Steven Stelfox, the indie-pop Patrick Bateman at the centre of this tale of murderous ambition. Stelfox\u2019s appetite for success is only matched by his appetite for debauchery \u2013 and in this, he is matched by pretty much every other character in the movie. All available surfaces are constantly coated with cocaine and prostitutes. This is not a film for anyone who requires their female characters to be more than the pneumatically inflated punchline to a lad gag. But the problem here is that while a reprehensible antihero is not necessarily an issue, an entire cast of equally repugnant characters is draining. It feels like taking a bath in anthrax. And, for all its smart-arse cynicism, the film is low on actual insights into the industry it is trying to skewer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
