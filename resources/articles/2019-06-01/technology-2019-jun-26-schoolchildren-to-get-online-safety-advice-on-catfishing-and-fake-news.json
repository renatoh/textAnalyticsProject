The guidelines will combine teaching on relationships, citizenship and computing to help students understand the technology behind targeted advertising, false profiles and other digital issues. Damian Hinds, the education secretary, said: \u201cIt\u2019s based on the premise that if you really understand the technology, you\u2019re less likely to get used by the technology. Then even when the technology changes, your knowledge is somewhat future-proof.\u201d The guidance, which is non-statutory, will advise schools to teach students about how URLs are made and what an IP address is, as well as how companies make targeted adverts through tracking behaviour and how someone can create a fake profile. \u201cAt the most elemental level, it\u2019s about understanding what people\u2019s motivations are \u2013 why people behave differently when they\u2019re behind a computer screen and why companies want to get your data for commercial advantage,\u201d Hinds said. The education secretary, speaking at an NSPCC conference about child online safety, said technology companies should not wait for legislation to be implemented to take action to protect children online. He stressed they should make it easier for parents to exercise control over what their children can see online and that child-safe modes should be the default setting in many cases. The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, also expressed commitment to implementing the online harms white paper and vowed to create a regulator that would impose sanctions on tech companies failing to abide by a code of practice. These sanctions would include fines, he said, but also place responsibility on company directors and potentially lead to sites being blocked. \u201cWe expect, we deserve and we will require that some of the cleverest companies in the world use their ingenuity to protect us, as well as to sell to us,\u201d he said. He added that guidelines for websites and apps on how to safeguard children from inappropriate content would be published in the autumn. Jim Gamble, a former chief executive of the National Crime Agency\u2019s child exploitation and online protection division, said the government had been too quick to blame tech companies. He said child vulnerability and mental health issues were the root causes that needed to be tackled, and these problems had been exacerbated by Conservative austerity measures. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to point the finger of blame and I think we do it too frequently at industry, perhaps not frequently enough at parents, but definitely we do not point the finger of blame where it belongs at government often enough,\u201d Gamble said. He also criticised the Tory leadership favourite Boris Johnson for saying money spent on investigating historical child sexual abuse allegations was \u201cspaffed up a wall\u201d. Gamble added: \u201cTo use a word with a sexual connotation like that is appalling, and I want to say to him that it\u2019s time that he came out and gave the full explanation of himself, and delivered an apology to every survivor who has felt hurt by that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
