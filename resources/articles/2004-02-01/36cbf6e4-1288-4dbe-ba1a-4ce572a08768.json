Ferguson has made a personal plea to some of the club's official supporter groups after increased pressure not just from his board of directors at Old Trafford but, crucially, the racing allies who have stuck by him throughout his legal dispute with Magnier. His chief executive David Gill has made it clear how badly it would reflect on the club if, as had been planned, any of the races involving Magnier's horses were disrupted, and a variety of influential racing figures have left him in no doubt about their own concerns. Ferguson has subsequently shifted from a position where he was understood to be enjoying the discomfort of United's biggest shareholder. He has made as much clear to groups such as United 4 Action and followed it up yesterday by authorising a carefully worded statement, released through the club, in which he spoke of his \"appreciation\" for their support but made it clear where he stood. \"[Sir Alex] is asking supporters to refrain from any form of protest and is strongly opposed to any violent, unlawful or disruptive behaviour that may reflect badly on the club and the supporters in general,\" the statement said. Tottenham's Ledley King has signed a new four-year contract with the club. King's previous deal was due to expire at the end of the 2004-05 season. \u00b7 Hereford equalled the Conference record scoreline last night with a 9-0 humiliation of 10-man Dagenham, who endured their worst-ever home defeat after Danny Shipp was dismissed after just 13 minutes. Hereford, closest challengers to the runaway leaders Chester, had five different scorers with a hat-trick for David Brown and two goals apiece from Steve Guinan and Danny Williams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
