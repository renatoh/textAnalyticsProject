The vista at the top alone is worth the trip: the Argenti\u00e8re basin on the left, with its immense glacier surrounded by towering peaks, most of them reaching above 4,000m; and the Dru on the right, a vertical kilometre of red granite. Beyond this lies Mont Blanc with the jagged heights of L'Aiguille du Midi in the foreground. There are three main routes down to choose from: furthest right is the easiest and widest but it often gets tracked out first; furthest left is the Rectalin Couloir, which is the most demanding of the descents. My best run ever here, however, was in the central couloir, an open face of perfectly-pitched steep, fresh snow. Power through the wide top section, feeling the snow hanging in the air behind you after every turn. The couloir narrows and you head through a tighter, steeper section before it opens out again into a field of easy-angled powder. Head left towards the dead tree that marks the exit from this wonderland - it's easy to spot as there are so few trees up this high. Pass the tree on the right, descending a slight gully, and then traverse leftwards on a wide flatish shelf until you come to the final exit couloir. Follow this to the bottom and you will find yourself among the madness of skiers finishing their descent of the glacier tourist route on the famous Vall\u00e9 Blanche. Col du Passon, Chamonix This is the run that I dream of when it is in good condition: natural halfpipes, windlips, drops and steeper faces. Again, this area is reached from the top of the Grande Montets, but instead of heading to the right this time, take a turn to the left. Head across the Argenti\u00e8re glacier using snow shoes and head up the face opposite the glacier des Rognon, to the left of the towering peak of the Chardonnet. The rocky ridge above is your destination, and a pleasant 1 hour hike takes you to the top of the final couloir at 3,028m, with nothing but fresh turns and amazing terrain awaiting you on the other side. You are now standing on the left flank of the glacier du Tour with nearly 2,000 vertical metres of descent below you. Enjoy the view over a picnic lunch, then head off along the plateau. The terrain soon steepens and opens up, and the hike feels a distant memory as you gun down, before ending up in Le Tour for a drink. When to go: December-April. Where to stay: McNab Mountain Sports (01546 830243, mcnab.co.uk) offers half-board chalet accommodation in Argenti\u00e8re from \u00a3275pp per week. Where to hire a guide: Compagnie des Guides de Chamonix (Maison de la Montagne 190, Place de l'Eglise, tel: 00 33 450 530088) is the world's oldest professional mountain guiding organisation. Evolution 2 (372 Avenue de la Plage, tel: 00 33 450 559022) is another good choice for English-speaking clients. Powder Mountain, Utah Famous for its snowcat skiing, this area north of Salt Lake City boasts some of the lightest powder in the state and the most fun terrain to go with it. The added luxury of the cat access to the top of Lightning Ridge makes it possible to get in miles of untracked riding, even though there is a relatively short vertical drop on the mountain. It feels strange to start the day from the top of the ridge, riding down through trees, open fields of untracked powder, steep chutes and rolling drops until picking up the track that takes you to the pick-up point in the woods below. After each run, you wait to be taken back up to the top. From there, you are free to spread out, finding new areas and new lines, because all paths lead you back into the bottom of the large basin and the pick-up point. The short vertical drop makes each run pass by quite quickly, but with the whole day to play with, this can add up to a lot of riding. You finish the day once again at the top of the mountain, rather than the bottom, and drive away with a big grin on your face. When to go: December-April. Where to stay: The Columbine Inn (001 801 745 3772, powdermountain.com) is the only accommodation available on the mountain, with rooms from about \u00a360 per night. Ogden, 19 miles away, offers more accommodation and livelier nightlife options. Where to hire a guide: Lightning Ridge backcountry tours can be booked at the Powder Mountain ticket office (tel as above). A five-ride Lightning Ridge snowcat pass costs about \u00a324. Punta Princesa, Argentina Above the town of San Carlos de Bariloche, in the eastern foothills of the Andes, is the Gran Catedral ski area. Head to the far left of the resort, to the top of the lifts on the Punta Princesa summit, then make the short hike out and up the ridge to your left until the powder bowls materialise. Condors glide gracefully overhead in the thin mountain air, while beneath stretch large bowls of powder, linked by couloirs and striped with rock bands like giant steps. Race through the top section, and two or three steps down, the first of the trees become visible below. A short step, and you are into the ghost woods. The trees are huge and eerie looking, covered in thick velvety moss that hangs from their trunks and branches. The snow and frost coating the moss give the scene a creepy, surreal aura, but the trees are perfectly spaced for riding between. Follow the golden rule - look at the gaps, not the trees - and you're laughing. There are also patches of bamboo. You soon learn to ride right through these; the bamboo parts and flexes as you pass, whipping back up into place to hide your passage. The run eventually follows a snowy road right back to the bottom of the ski area, where one of the oldest and dodgiest chairlifts that I've ever seen takes you back up for one more. When to go: mid June-late September. Where to stay: The best hotel in the area is the Llao Llao (0054 2944 448525), a five-star spa resort on Lake Mascardi about 20 minutes' drive out of town. Standard twin suites cost from \u00a3127pp per night. The Edelweiss (0054 2944 426165) is a cheaper alternative in the middle of town, with standard rooms from \u00a341pp. Where to hire a guide: At the local tourist office (Avenida 12 de Octubre 605, tel: 00 54 2944 423022) or through hotel reception desks. Mount Ruapehu, New Zealand While most people head to the South Island and the areas around Queenstown, the snow-clad volcano Mount Ruapehu makes the North Island an equally tantalising prospect. The riding here is on the live volcano with its constantly steaming crater lake and sister ski areas of Turoa and Whakapapa. A few years ago, the mountain, which sits above the town of Ohakune, erupted, but it is now dormant again and the ski area is back in full swing. The terrain is exciting, mostly carved and shaped by lava flows offering great gullies and steep drops. The best day is the trip to the crater. After an hour's hike from the top of the lifts on the Turoa side of the mountain, you are standing at 2,797m, looking down into the steaming lake. The snow reaches all the way to the water so you can ride the steep slope down into the crater, the smell of sulphur ever increasing. Then head back up to the lowest point of the rim, and you are ready for the ride back to Turoa. Great open powder fields are once again under foot as you race down, charging left towards the foot of the lifts without having to cross a single track. When to go: June-October. Where to stay: The Powderhorn Chateau (powderhorn.co.nz) in Ohakune, about 30 minutes' drive from the Turoa lifts, has double/twin rooms from \u00a355 per night. Where to hire a guide: Vern at Outdoor Experiences in Whakapapa village (outdoorexperiences@xtra.co.nz). \u00b7 Neil McNab is co-owner of McNab Mountain Sports (01546 830243, mcnab.co.uk)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
