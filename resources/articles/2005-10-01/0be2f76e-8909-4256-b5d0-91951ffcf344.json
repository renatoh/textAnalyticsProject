Supplies to homes would be maintained even in the face of the harsh conditions encountered only once every 50 years. If gas supplies for power stations had to be reduced, electricity generation could be sustained by using coal, nuclear and oil-fired generators. A number of organisations have expressed concern about supplies this winter as reliance on imported gas increases with the fall in North Sea output."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
