Clarke was appointed first-team coach until the end of the season within days of Dalglish's return as temporary manager in January. The Scot has spoken of his desire to continue working alongside Dalglish and that wish is almost certain to be granted after FSG approached the former Chelsea and West Ham United coach over extending his stay. Dalglish has held talks with John W Henry and Tom Werner, Liverpool's principal owner and chairman respectively, over succeeding Roy Hodgson on a long-term basis, although his widely anticipated appointment is yet to be finalised. Both Dalglish and Clarke are likely to be handed three-year deals having rapidly transformed the club, with Liverpool's owners aware that any return to English football by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho could result in the Real Madrid manager offering Clarke, who was his right-hand man at Chelsea, the chance of a reunion. Clarke said: \"Every manager I've worked with \u2013 you pick up good qualities from all of them and so far, in a short space of time, I've seen a lot of great qualities from Kenny. I hope to continue the work into the future. \"Anyone watching us play right now can see the spirit is high, the confidence is good and the performances have been decent. Now we need to continue it. If you are working well as a group and working well day in, day out in training \u2013 you can see they're taking that on to the pitch right now. If you've got that togetherness it goes a long way in any team sport \u2013 especially football.\" Jamie Carragher is expected to continue at the heart of the Liverpool defence against Birmingham City on Saturday despite being carried off with concussion in the 1-1 draw with Arsenal on Sunday. Andy Carroll and F\u00e1bio Aur\u00e9lio joined an already extensive injury list at the Emirates with knee and hamstring problems respectively and are doubtful for the home game but Carragher has recovered well from the second-half collision with his 18-year-old team-mate John Flanagan. There is also no stipulation from the Football Association that any player who suffers concussion has to remain sidelined for a specified period of time. Clarke said: \"F\u00e1bio has picked up another little strain. Hopefully it's not too bad. We have to keep positive with him because he's a terrific player, as he showed in the Man City game. Carra seems OK and with Andy Carroll, at the moment we're waiting on some news from the medical department.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
