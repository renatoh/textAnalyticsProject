Made in 1993, it features a heroine who is a flying, whip-cracking killing machine brought up by wolves, and the evil nemesis is a pair of conjoined twins. The usual rules apply - lull the brain into neutral and enjoy the visuals from painterly director Ronny Yu, best known in the west for directing Bride of Chucky. The lighting, colours and costumes put you insensual overload; the Gone With the Wind sunsets, wild winds, flashing swords and avenging spirits keep things lively; and it's quite sexy in places, as well as showing occasional evidence of a sense of humour - often the missing link in Asian melodrama. The DVD is in letterbox format with clear subtitles (or dodgy English dubbing, if you prefer). The Bride with White Hair 2 is also available. Battlefield Earth Rental Warner Cert 12 You may be tempted to rent Battlefield Earth just to see what on earth John Travolta is doing disguised as Roy Wood, with what look like long pieces of spaghetti extending from his nostrils. The answer is: appearing in one of the year's worst films, a murky, quasi-religious \"saga of the year 3000\", which - with its preponderance of shaggy longhairs - looks more like 1000BC, but unfortunately with dialogue instead of grunts. It combines the worst of both sci-fi worlds by spelling individual scenes out as if for a five-year-old while the structure remains incomprehensible and stupendously uninteresting. But there's a little mirth to be gained from Travolta and evil cohort Forest Whitaker, who clearly realise they're in a Golden Raspberry contender and camp it up outrageously. Travolta is a Scientologist, and this derives from a book by the movement's founder, L Ron Hubbard. Moral: never join a religion before your agent's seen the small print. Cinema Paradiso Retail (\u00a315.99) and DVD (\u00a319.99) Arrow Cert PG In a Guardian readers' poll from 1993, Giuseppe Tornatore's 1989 movie was voted best film made since 1980 (the runners-up were Blue Velvet, Raging Bull, GoodFellas and Fanny and Alexander). It won the best foreign language film Oscar too, and here it is on DVD in a glowingly remastered director's cut, bumped up from two hours to 170 minutes. The early stage - when our infant hero in a small Sicilian town learns things from projectionist Philippe Noiret, and the local priest censors every kiss from film prints - works a treat. The rather wan romance is less memorable, but Tornatore has an eye for telling detail. His film warns against nostalgia and regret, but is full of both."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
