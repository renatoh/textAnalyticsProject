According to a Tokyo video-entertainment insider, rugby players can earn 100,000 Yen (\u00a3520) 'without actually engaging in gay sex - it's good money'. Clearly, shame isn't what it used to be in Japan. 2 Ireland hooker Shane Byrne. Asked about pre-match sex, he said: 'To be honest, now with twin girls and everyone tired and cranky, I would take it when I could get it, even at half-time.' FCUK Award 'I despise them as much as they despise everyone else,' said France No 8 Imanol Harinordoquy. 'As long as we beat England I wouldn't mind if we lost every other game in the Six Nations.' For breaking the mould 1 Harlequins, whose clever ploy to limit Sale's dangerous wingers was to narrow their pitch from 69 to 65 metres. It didn't quite work. The visitors won 45-0. 2 Rudolph Straeuli, for subjecting his players to a boot camp in the bush, where they were stripped naked and threatened with guns. The coach was stripped of his job within a month of the World Cup. Self-Promo award Danny Grewcock on Martin Johnson, for whom he stood in against Italy: 'Jonno is a great player because he doesn't have bad games. I don't compare myself with him. It would probably depress me.' For hanging in there 1 'It's not fantastic. At least my life isn't dull. It's a dynamic job. But you'd be dishonest to say it's fun. I think at Leicester it might be fun, when you're almost always winning.' London Irish coach Brendan Venter on battling against relegation. 2 'You don't have to watch reality TV when you are involved in the Zurich Premiership.' Brian Smith, coach of Bath as they faced possible relegation and merger with Bristol. Cunning plan award Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan, before the Six Nations decider: 'The key to Sunday is to give the performance of our lives. That's our plan. It's a very simple plan. If we do that, England will have a lot of problems.' General Custer award Martin Johnson, who got his England team to stand their ground, upsetting protocol and the Irish president, during the presentations in Dublin. Later he said: 'It was one of those things that you think about on a Monday morning and wonder whether it was important. But at the time it was.' Dirty Harry award All Blacks centre Ma'a Nonu: 'This is the time when we forget everything else and just do the business, like in those action movies with cops and stuff, when one dies and the other cop has to avenge his death.' The All Blacks didn't, of course. Perhaps the colourful image can now work for the next World Cup. Most wayward attack Namibia coach Dave Waterson, who complained after his side's 64-7 defeat to Ireland: 'The tragedy is that if you are a referee and you want the big appointments you have to go out and lick the backsides of some of the top nations.' Later, Namibia lost 142-0 to Australia. History awards 1 Ex-Wallaby Toutai Kefu, on England's 16-players-on-the-pitch error: 'The whole thing just smacks of arrogance. But then the English have always been an arrogant race. Go back in history, look at the English army. Who goes to war dressed up in red coats?' 2 Sydney Morning Herald on England's kicking game: 'Rain, hail or shine, the Six Nations disease will influence the outcome of the World Cup final. Undoubtedly, like myxomatosis, botulism, swine fever and foot-and-mouth, it is here to stay.' Media liaison award Mark Shaw, former All Black, on young journalists: 'You've got a lot of fleas in the system. They write shit. I'll talk about footy to anyone I respect, who understands footy. But I can't waste my time talking footy with fleas.' Top defence England media officer Richard Prescott, who wore his World Cup medal with justified pride. OTT award Jonny Wilkinson, on celebrating World Cup victory: 'I did have a couple of beers, but that was only really as a solidarity thing with the other guys.' Best change of angle Canada stand-in captain Mark Lawson, when asked if he had been made to feel like a second-class citizen in the World Cup: 'I'm used to living underground in a bedsit at university. Here, I've stayed in the best hotels, I've signed autographs, I don't have to cook food every night and I'm sitting here talking to reporters. So I guess I feel a bit of a movie star.'
