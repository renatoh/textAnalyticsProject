In rallying from 6-3 down to within a frame of victory, Murphy compiled breaks of 81, 129, 107 and 73 in amassing 517 points without Williams potting a ball. However, the Welshman, renowned for his tenacity, fired in a series of superb long pots in the following three frames, most notably the last red to a baulk pocket in the decider. \"At 8-6 he was so fluent and I had no confidence. I was convinced I'd had it. For most of the day my long game was non existent and I'm bewildered why it came back when I needed it,\" said Williams, who now plays John Higgins for the \u00a3100,000 first prize. Should he overcome Williams, Higgins, who beat Mark Allen 9-5 in his semi-final, will replace Neil Robertson at the top of the world rankings; quite an upgrade in fortunes. During the summer, Higgins could not stomach the thought of practice. Awaiting a disciplinary tribunal ruling, he spent his time soul-searching, wondering whether his outstanding career would end in scandal. The Scot, 35, was eventually banned for six months for failing to report an approach to throw frames and, since his return to competition, has benefited from reprieved-man syndrome. Higgins is intensely motivated, and not only by a wish to divert attention back to his outstanding on-table record. His father, John senior, a popular figure on the tour, is seriously ill."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
