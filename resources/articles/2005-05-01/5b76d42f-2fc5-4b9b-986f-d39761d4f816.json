Mindful of the need to win a referendum on the European constitution next year, the chancellor will tell the CBI's annual dinner in London that the 12-member eurozone economy has only grown half as fast as Britain or the United States over the past five years. \"And as we look ahead to the rest of 2005, the latest risk is low economic growth in Europe - 1% below what was expected a year ago - particularly low in Germany, our largest export market in the euro area,\" Mr Brown will tell businessmen. \"Because 50% of our trade is with Europe, Britain must and will promote labour, product and capital market reform in Europe. And in our presidency of the EU we will push forward our proposals to liberalise the single market and make the European economy more dynamic.\" Mr Brown has long been frustrated at the euro zone's poor economic growth and lack of action on reform since a key summit in Lisbon five years ago pledged to make the bloc dynamic and competitive. As a result British membership of the euro remains off the agenda. The chancellor will stress the government's determination to keep the British opt-out on the 48-hour working week, which was thrown out by the European parliament last week. \"Our aim is a Europe that instead of being a trade bloc looking inward on itself, looks outward, engages with the rest of the world and reforms and liberalises to meet the global challenge,\" he will say, adding that he wants to try to build the \"first truly national consensus\" on Europe in Britain, built around economic reform. The government has said it will hold a referendum on the European constitution next year. But if France rejects the constitution in its referendum on May 29, or the Dutch do three days later, there may be no referendum here. Amid renewed speculation that the Blair government might be willing to compromise on Britain's \u20ac4.6bn (\u00a33.1bn) EU budget rebate if other historic subsidies - notably on EU farm prices - are reformed, Downing St yesterday stuck to its line that the rebate was \"fully justified\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
