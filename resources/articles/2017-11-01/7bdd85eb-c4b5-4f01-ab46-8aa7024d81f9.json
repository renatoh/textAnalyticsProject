O\u2019Neill is likely to receive offers from clubs and countries following Northern Ireland\u2019s controversial defeat by Switzerland in the World Cup play-offs. The 48-year-old, who has also been linked with the vacancies at Sunderland and Rangers, insisted it was too early to contemplate his future in the aftermath of Sunday\u2019s elimination in Basel. Scotland hope to capitalise on Northern Ireland\u2019s misery by offering O\u2019Neill a four-year contract worth up to \u00a31m per year with bonuses \u2013 double what he earns with the Irish Football Association \u2013 to revive their dwindling fortunes. O\u2019Neill, who lives in Edinburgh, is well-known to officials at the Scottish FA and is their first choice for the job. Austin MacPhee, his Kirkcaldy-born assistant with Northern Ireland who is also assistant head coach at Heart of Midlothian, is expected to be offered a director of football role with the SFA. O\u2019Neill is under contract at the IFA until 2020 with a compensation clause of \u00a3750,000. However, that sum is graded according to where O\u2019Neill goes and is likely to have dropped as a consequence of Northern Ireland not qualifying for their first World Cup since 1986. Their next competitive qualifier is not until March 2019 and, although a club role would offer the former Brechin City and Shamrock Rovers manager more day-to-day involvement, he is happy \u2013 and successful \u2013 in international football. Scotland could face competition for O\u2019Neill\u2019s services from Major League Soccer. Several clubs in the United States are believed to be interested in O\u2019Neill, who has a brother in Chicago and is a fan of US sports. Northern Ireland\u2019s players were united in their desire for O\u2019Neill to continue following the gut-wrenching play-off defeat but unsure about his intentions. Jonny Evans said: \u201cAs a manager he\u2019s unbelievable, we all love him and every single player plays for him. It would be a shame to lose him but we know on the other side, management is such a difficult job and if something came up, where it would be difficult to turn down, no one would ever begrudge him that. \u201cI can definitely understand why there is interest in him. He\u2019s so inspirational, he\u2019s very tactical. Even the other night, we had just got off the plane and were on the bus to the hotel. He had watched the first half of the game and he came down the bus and said: \u2018We\u2019re calling a meeting tonight and we\u2019re going to watch the game again because you didn\u2019t play that bad, there are so many basic things you can improve on.\u2019 It gave everyone a lift straight away. He\u2019s got such composure and his team talks, he says the right things to get the lads going. You can see everyone plays for him and we all really, really respect him.\u201d Michael McGovern, Northern Ireland\u2019s goalkeeper, concurred: \u201cMichael\u2019s stock is so high at the minute. We would love him to stay but I\u2019m sure there will be interest elsewhere. Michael is his own man and makes his own decisions. If he\u2019s here for the next campaign, we will be absolutely delighted as players.\u201d The sense that the Switzerland game marked the end of an era was not restricted to the manager. Gareth McAuley declined to comment on his future but Evans said he was \u201c95% certain\u201d his 37-year-old defensive partner would not retire from international football. Chris Brunt, however, admitted he was considering whether to continue and the 38-year-old Aaron Hughes, who made his 109th appearance against Switzerland, may also retire. \u201cAll good things have to come to an end at some stage,\u201d said Brunt. \u201cIt\u2019s been very good the last four or five years under Michael. It\u2019s been as enjoyable to be part of this group as any I\u2019ve been involved in and I\u2019ve been playing for the last 14 years. It would have been nice to top it off with the World Cup, but it wasn\u2019t to be. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to say anything now. I\u2019m as gutted as I\u2019ve ever been in my football career.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
