Williams will apply to the BHA's licensing committee to renew his licence after a three-month ban on charges that arose from evidence presented to the Old Bailey trial. However, he has been informed by the BHA that its integrity and legal department will oppose his application, and Williams will be forced to argue his case himself since he cannot afford a solicitor. \"I've been off three months, so how am I going to afford to hire someone?\" Williams said yesterday. \"I'll have to do it all myself. I'm disgusted, really, because this is the third time I've been tried [on the same charges]. How can that be right?\" The two jockeys who also faced trial alongside Williams in the autumn of 2007 have both been back in the saddle in recent months. Kieren Fallon returned to race-riding last month after an 18-month ban for a positive drugs test, while Fergal Lynch, who was fined \u00a350,000 by the BHA and told he could not apply for a licence in Britain for 12 months when he appeared before the disciplinary panel in June, was riding with considerable success at Philadelphia Park in America until late July. He was then banned for 12 months by the Pennsylvania Racing Commission, which had received details of his case from the British authorities. Williams, meanwhile, had nearly 300 rides in Britain in 2008, but had been sidelined by injury since May when he received his latest three-month suspension. He admitted five charges of passing inside information for reward when he appeared before the BHA's disciplinary panel in June, and also admitted to associating with Miles Rodgers, another defendant at the Old Bailey trial, when Rodgers was already a disqualified person. Williams said yesterday that he has been informed of three reasons why the Authority has decided to oppose his application. \"I don't want to go into too much detail,\" he said, \"but I've been told one of the reasons they are objecting is because of a quote I gave to the Racing Post. \"One of the quotes that they want to put to the panel is that I'd said I felt very angry because I'd been very unfairly treated [when banned for three months]. Fergal Lynch admitted that he had stopped a horse for money, and he was still riding, but I was warned off for three months.\" The BHA's objections are also thought to involve information provided to the licensing committee by Williams when he was granted a licence following the collapse of the Old Bailey trial. Williams is due before the BHA licensing committee at 2pm, and expects to hear the result of their deliberations later today. Nicky Henderson, whose three-month suspension for a breach of the anti-doping rules ended this month, saddled his first winner since when Tetlami \u2013 in the colours of Paul Roy, the BHA chairman \u2013 won at Exeter yesterday. Henderson was also fined \u00a340,000 after Moonlit Path, owned by the Queen, tested positive for tranexamic acid, a drug that can shorten clotting time, after a race in February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
