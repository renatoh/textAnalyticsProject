It was of sufficient ease and margin for Newcastle to be guaranteed passage into the second round. Just as importantly it will give a struggling team some much needed confidence as they travel to meet Arsenal at Highbury tomorrow night in the Premiership. Craig Bellamy, who had scored once in Newcastle's previous 20 games, set them on their way with two goals in four first-half minutes and Titus Bramble, Alan Shearer and Darren Ambrose, with his first for the club, completed an emphatic victory. It should mean a temporary reduction in pressure on Sir Bobby Robson but the Newcastle manager knows he must visit Arsenal and then entertain Southampton without Jonathan Woodgate. The injury-prone centre-half has recovered from a stomach strain only to pick up another problem. He is to have a double hernia operation on Saturday morning, meaning that Newcastle will have to do without him for six weeks at least. \"We'll be OK but it's a cruel blow,\" said Robson of Woodgate. \"He went to see the specialist in Manchester today and we will have to be without him for a few weeks.\" Last night's triumph was all the more necessary after that news. \"This was what we needed,\" Robson said. \"Obviously this was important, we were back to something like our best. It's a question of time, patience and support. It was important that finally we won in front of our own public.\" Against limited opposition last night Woodgate's absence was not marked. Nor was Nolberto Solano's, another major doubt for Highbury. Kieron Dyer filled Solano's wide right role and arguably had his most influential game of the season. It was Dyer who initiated the best goal, Bellamy's and Newcastle's second, with a smart diagonal burst into midfield and a cute, quick pass to Laurent Robert. Robert had an enjoyable evening against inferior players and he supplied an intelligent cross when he might have had a shot. Bellamy charged in to roll the ball home from 10 yards. That was in the 37th minute. Six minutes earlier Bellamy had been released by a flick of Shearer's head to Andy O'Brien's upfield pass. Clear and one on one with the Breda goalkeeper Gabor Babos, the Welshman belied his mini-drought with a cool lob. Twice before half-time, however, Shay Given made significant saves as Breda intermittently passed the ball with fluency. The first was low from Johan Elmander, the big striker having got the wrong side of Bramble. The second was a spectacular one-handed deflection to deny Tamas Peto from 25 yards. \"It could have been 2-2 at half-time,\" said Robson. That was correct but then Bellamy also struck the crossbar immediately after the interval and Babos had made an alert block from the same player before the first goal. On the hour Babos was given no protection from his defence, allowing Bramble to power in a free header at the near post. Shearer then missed a sitter from six yards but made amends with a thunderous 20-yard drive. Robert had teed up the effort with a short free-kick and the Frenchman finished a re-invigorated personal performance with an 89th-minute cross for Ambrose to convert. Ambrose cost \u00a31.5m when he joined from Ipswich in April. This was his first appearance at St James' Park. Along with his team-mates, his confidence should benefit from a comprehensive win. But Arsenal will be a different matter. Newcastle United (4-4-2): Given; Hughes, O'Brien, Bramble, Bernard (Viana, 84); Dyer (Ambrose, 78), Jenas, Speed, Robert; Bellamy (Ameobi, 84), Shearer.
