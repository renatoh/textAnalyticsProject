After this vital victory, over a Reading team which had been unspeakably awful, the Fulham manager denied he felt \"upbeat\" and insisted there was still a \"mountain to climb\" before Premier League safety could be reached. \"If we continue to play like that, we would have cause to believe that our task is not quite impossible,\" he said. The conspiracy theorists, though, are not quite so measured. They remember how Fulham escaped the drop last season and, all of a sudden, the parallels are falling into place. Last May, in the penultimate league fixture, Liverpool visited Craven Cottage, preoccupied by the Champions League, having edged past Chelsea in the semi-final. Rafael Ben\u00edtez made nine changes to his starting line-up and Fulham won 1-0, en route to survival by one point. This time Liverpool visit on Saturday, with four games to play but, once again, they are consumed by the Champions League. They entertain Chelsea at Anfield in the first leg of the semi-final three days afterwards and it is inconceivable that Ben\u00edtez will not rest key players against Fulham. Last season seven of his starting line-up for the Champions League final against Milan did not even travel to west London, including Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher, Javier Mascherano and Dirk Kuyt. The team he picked featured Gabriel Paletta and Emiliano Ins\u00faa in defence and Mark Gonz\u00e1lez at left midfield; Harry Kewell replaced him as a substitute. Lawrie Sanchez was then Fulham's caretaker manager, after the sacking of Chris Coleman, and the victory stopped a run of 10 league games without a win. It was Sanchez's only success in his five matches at the end of the season but it was sufficient to secure him the job on a permanent basis. In short the 90 minutes were pivotal in Fulham's history. The ethics of Ben\u00edtez's team selection at such a sensitive stage of the season stirred debate and recriminations. \"I didn't actually know some of the players,\" said Neil Warnock, the Sheffield United manager, who would ultimately be relegated while his Wigan counterpart, Paul Jewell, felt that \"for the good of the game, the integrity of the game, resting nine players cannot be right\". Ben\u00edtez's selection this Saturday will be of great interest not only to Fulham but to Bolton, Birmingham, Reading and Wigan. \"We don't know which players Ben\u00edtez will pick but even Liverpool's reserve team doesn't look too bad to me,\" said Hodgson. \"There are one or two players in there that most managers would like to work with, so we might come down to earth with a bump.\" Hope springs for Fulham, though, and once again the Liverpool game represents a potential springboard to safety. They also have Birmingham at home in their run-in while they finish at Portsmouth, who by then may have their minds on the FA Cup final against Cardiff. Hodgson described the victory at the Madejski Stadium as a \"psychological breakthrough\" - Fulham had not previously won away from home in the Premier League since September 2006 - yet triumphs in isolation will not suffice. Fulham have failed to win back-to-back matches all season. Their survival appears to depend on bucking the trend. \"We have to win three of our last four and, if not, get two wins and two draws,\" said Danny Murphy, the former Liverpool midfielder, who hopes not to see too many of his old friends on Saturday. \"I will speak to the boys this week and hopefully Stevie [Gerrard], [Fernando] Torres and a few of the others will stay at home. \"To be honest, you don't really want to be playing Liverpool but it's a great opportunity and they might rest a few. We showed [at Reading] that we are a decent side when we play to our potential but we have to do that more often.\" Hodgson noted the importance of Brian McBride's early goal - Fulham had only once scored first in a game in the previous three months - and the passing football which he has preached since he succeeded Sanchez at the turn of the year got its reward. Fulham ought to have been more comfortable but the woodwork denied them three times before the substitute Erik Nevland scored his first for the club. Reading might have made themselves safe with victory but Steve Coppell, whose team travel to Arsenal on Saturday, admitted that life was now \"a lot more complicated; we have it all to do\". The manager said his players had been \"uptight, nervous\" and made the point that not many of them had been in a relegation scrap before. On Saturday's evidence, the pressure is getting to them. Kevin Doyle's 42nd-minute header apart, when the striker should have scored, Reading created nothing. They were second best in every area and too many players hid. They seemed paralysed by the moment. Liam Rosenior, the Reading full-back, was part of the Fulham survival fight last time out. \"At the end of the season some teams are already on holiday and some teams are playing for their lives,\" he said. \"We know which position we are in.\" Man of the match: Brian McBride The American striker gives Fulham a focal point and his physical presence repeatedly unsettled Reading. His technique, as evidenced by the left-footed volley that rattled the bar, and awareness caught the eye, too. Best moment His clinical finish into the top corner, having slid on to Simon Davies' low cross from the left wing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
