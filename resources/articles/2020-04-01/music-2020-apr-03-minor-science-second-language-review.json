Second Language is the result of the producer and DJ\u2019s fascination with language and translation, a byproduct of picking up German (and perhaps his own extensive work with words \u2013 many in the scene may first have known Minor Science as dance music journalist Angus Finlayson). He\u2019s been communicating his ideas through sound for some eight years or so, breaking through with off-techno 12-inches for quirky, peripherally club-oriented labels the Trilogy Tapes and Whities. With writing on the backburner and DJing paying the bills, he has one of electronica\u2019s more peculiar and curious albums to show for his transition to the studio. Second Language sheds expectations almost immediately, eschewing dance music\u2019s traditionally rigid structures to instead pack three different beats into second track Balconies. The record\u2019s at its best when it\u2019s morphing and momentum-building, such as on For Want of Gelt and Blue Deal \u2013 the former a tumble through sweeping spacecraft synths and overclocked bass rumbles, the latter a marriage of breakbeat swing and funky percussion. Drum\u2019n\u2019bass, chillout and so-called IDM serve as stylistic reference points, means through which to articulate complexities and artefacts while maintaining a clarity of sound. Intriguingly, the record manages to wield this extended 90s palette without becoming encumbered by nostalgia, and its uptempo passages enter warp speed without slamming into undue intensity. But it\u2019s held back by the moments in between \u2013 the troughs, where bluesy pads plod in unmemorable cadences and obscure the clarity of vision elsewhere."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
