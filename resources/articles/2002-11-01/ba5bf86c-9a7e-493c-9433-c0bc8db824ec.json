These two can set the tone and have the capacity to dominate even the best bowling, although controlled, calculated aggression should not spill over into recklessness. John Crawley His selection for the tour raised eyebrows, not least in Australia, where seamers rubbed their hands at the prospect. Thus far, though, with a point to prove, he has batted with excellent technique and diligence. He works to a game plan that eliminates risks, plays the percentages and relies on crease occupation and accumulation. He will need to make his presence felt more when batting with the tail. Matthew Hoggard An appalling, dispiriting record in his past four Tests ought to mean that he has no claim to a place in this Test. But not playing against Australia A in Hobart, where the England pace bowling gave pie-throwing a bad name, may have turned out to be a good career move. However, he needs to rediscover his swing, consistency and line if he is not to continue as Matthew Hayden's benefit barrel of runs. Andy Caddick This is England's premier bowler now and it would be helpful if he turned up at the start. The Australians know he has the capacity to be devastating at his best but they also understand that, if they get after him, his head will drop. He needs to make early statements with the first new ball, breaking through into a vulnerable middle order."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
