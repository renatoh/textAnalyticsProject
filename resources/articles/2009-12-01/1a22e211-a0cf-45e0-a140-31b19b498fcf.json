Visiting the booth of the climate activism group SustainUS, Monckton called the young delegates \"Hitler youth\", \"Nazis\", and \"Hitler-ish\" in a six-minute long exchange on Thursday that was posted on YouTube. Monckton was furious that the group had gatecrashed an event by the climate sceptic group Americans for Prosperity on Wednesday. Several dozen activists interrupted a speech unfurling banners calling for \"Clean Energy Now\", which prompted Monckton to take the microphone and accuse them of being \"crazed Hitler youth\". He returned yesterday for a further discussion: Monckton said to Ben Wessel, a 20-year-old activist from Middlebury College, Vermont, who is Jewish, said last night: \"I was so surprised. I hoped to have a more civil conversation with the man. It's fine that we have differences, but it's not okay to pull out such hateful language.\" Monckton is one of the most prominent climate change sceptics and regularly makes TV appearances on the subject, including on US Fox News anchor Glenn Beck's show. He also undertook a lecture tour of US audiences this year and this week joined the UK Independence party, which denies climate change is man-made. He is the hereditary third Viscount Monckton of Brenchley. 1 Monckton: \"There hasn't been any global warming for 15 years and you know it.\" 2 Monckton: \"I will call you Hitler youth if you ever again interrupt any meeting at which I am present, where we are trying to have a private conversation.\" 3 Activist: \"Stop calling us Nazis and base the discussion on principles.\" 4 Monckton: \"If you behave like the Hitler youth, I'll call you what you are \u2013 Hitler youth.\" 5 Wessel (left): \"I would like to give you my card.\" Monckton: \"I do not want the cards of the Hitler youth. No.\" 6 \"Don't you dare ever invade any meeting of mine again and behave in that childish, boonish, Hitler-ish fashion.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
