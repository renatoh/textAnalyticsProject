The practices include 543 in England, says Dr Maureen Baker, chair of the Royal College of GPs (RCGP). The RCGP has identified up to 600 practices where more than 90% of the GPs are aged 60 or over, many of whom will retire over the next 12 months. Family doctors retire on average at the age of 59. \u201cUnless drastic action is taken to make sure that there are enough doctors to take their place, thousands of patients could be forced to travel miles to their nearest GP practice or be left stranded with no family doctor at all,\u201d the college says. Addressing the RCGP\u2019s annual conference on Thursday, Baker will say the number of young doctors choosing to become GPs is falling well short of the numbers who are leaving the profession by taking early retirement or going to work abroad or pursuing other careers. Concern is rising that more and more GPs are suffering burnout as they struggle to keep up with the pressure of ever-growing numbers of patients, sometimes up to 60 a day each, many of whom are more medically complicated older people, amid the NHS\u2019s financial squeeze. The government target of recruiting 50% of medical graduates to become GPs is also being missed. Last year only 40% of them opted to enter general practice. Baker will tell the 2,000 GP delegates in Liverpool that the rest of the NHS, especially A&amp;E units, might have to pick up the pieces if surgeries cannot cope. Likening general practice to the \u201cwalls of a dam\u201d that prevent the wider NHS from being flooded, she will say that: \u201cSo far much of the damage to the dam wall has been hidden from the public. They see the flooding downstream in A&amp;E departments and in hospital pressures, but they haven\u2019t been aware that GPs, nurses and practice teams have been absorbing that pressure by trying to do more and more with less and less. \u201cBut if we let that situation continue we will see whole chunks of the dam fall apart when practices have to shut their doors.\u201d Andy Burnham, shadow health secretary, said that despite David Cameron\u2019s party conference pledges on the NHS, he had \u201cpresided over a crisis in general practice and collapse in GP morale\u201d. \u201cPeople are already struggling to get GP appointments and these figures suggest things are about to get even worse, not better, if hundreds of surgeries close for good.\u201d The Department of Health said it was taking steps to boost GP numbers. \u201cWe know GPs are under pressure, which is why we\u2019re increasing trainees so that GP numbers continue to grow faster than the population and will train 10,000 more primary and community health and care staff by 2020, including 5000 more GPs,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cThere are already 1,000 more GPs than in 2010 and we\u2019re making it easier for GPs to return to the profession.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
