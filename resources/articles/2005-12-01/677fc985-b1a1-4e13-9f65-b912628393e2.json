Who can doubt that stamps, long evenings with an address book and lengths of string hanging over the fireplace are now history? Or perhaps they aren't. Even if you receive a carefully personalised e-card, the potential for deep personal hurt seems pretty sizeable. Don't they inevitably seem a bit perfunctory? If a perusal of the web is anything to go by, 90% of the ready-to-use messages on offer are simply a bit crap. \"Yo, man!\" reads a typical e-card, available from 123greetings.com. \"Time for lotsa holiday cheer and a rockin' new year.\" If you're more partial to the tasteful Dickensian skating scene, you're probably stuffed. And what about those of us who want to smugly underline our big-hearted credentials by sending cards that fund and publicise the right causes? And yet there is a case for the defence. First, if you spurn traditional cards, you save trees. Second, if your friends are so hung up on advertising their popularity via vast card displays, they can use a printer. Third, the online card market is now sufficiently mature to contain plenty of feelgood options: merrychristmas.co.uk, for example, offers the chance to pledge \u00a35 to Great Ormond Street and then send \"up to 50 animated electronic cards direct from your computer\". Just to make it that bit more appealing, the appeal is backed by \"Caprice, Toby Anstis, Jade Parfitt, Jasmine Guinness and Rageh Omaar\". This is, then, a bit of a tricky one, best answered with a compromise. For your cutting-edge friends, the email card is probably fine, though blind-copying in all your contacts seems very rude indeed. However, less tech-advanced types - who may or may not include elderly relatives - are still best served by a trip to the post office, not least because of the potential for mishaps. One slip of the finger at cardfountain.com, for example, and someone will get a card that plays a parping version of Sleigh Ride and promises, in large type, \"Sex in a tree!\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
