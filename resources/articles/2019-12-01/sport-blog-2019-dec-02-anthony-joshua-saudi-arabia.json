Two British sporting icons. Variations on a theme. Scene one: a supremely jet-lagged Anthony Joshua in a Heathrow hotel in September. After several softballs about his rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr, the question finally comes. Why fight in Saudi Arabia when Amnesty International says the regime is using you to sportswash its \u201cabysmal\u201d human rights record that includes using public beheadings as a weapon to crush dissent? \u201cI appreciate them voicing an opinion,\u201d replies Joshua, before stressing he is not a superhero who can zap away the world\u2019s problems by donning a cape. When pressed, he mumbles something about \u201creforms\u201d and then suggests he can use his relationship with the Saudis to ask difficult questions rather than \u201cjust accusing, pointing fingers and shouting from Great Britain\u201d. Scene two: Sebastian Coe in a sweaty press conference at the World Athletics Championships in Qatar a month later. Again human rights concerns are raised. But this time Lord Coe goes much further. Sport, he says, has a unique power to \u201cshine the spotlight on issues\u201d and is the \u201cbest diplomat we have\u201d. \u201cThat is why sport will continue to work and sweat as hard as it does to make social change,\u201d he continues, proselytising with the fervour of a true believer. \u201cAnd organisations that are smart are actually partnering as they realise they can elicit that change.\u201d It\u2019s a seductive premise, isn\u2019t it? Sport as a sort of human-rights Heineken, somehow able to refresh and open up countries that traditional statecraft can\u2019t reach. The reality does not match the rhetoric. Professor Simon Chadwick of the Salford Business school, who specialises in the geo-politics and marketing of sport, is blunt. \u201cIt is difficult to identify a country anywhere in the world that has fundamentally and sustainably changed for the better as a result of sport,\u201d he says. Chadwick accepts there have been small improvements in some Gulf states: women being allowed into football matches in Saudi Arabia and Iran, for instance. \u201cBut without other, broader policy measures, it won\u2019t bring about a massive shift in attitudes and behaviours,\u201d he warns. Even the small changes in workers\u2019 rights for those working on 2022 football World Cup stadiums comes with a caveat. \u201cThese improvements are not necessarily being replicated in other industrial sectors across the country,\u201d Chadwick says. \u201cQatar now has a twin-track labour market: one where standards are robust even by international standards and another where practices remain deeply suspect.\u201d Nick McGeehan, a co-director of the human rights research organisation Fair/Square Research &amp; Projects, is even more sceptical about sport\u2019s power to improve human rights in repressive countries. \u201cIt\u2019s a great line for sports administrators to trot out but the Gulf provides numerous examples of why the argument tends to be bogus and self-serving,\u201d he says. He cites the UAE, which has gone further than most regimes in using sport, as well as arts and literature festivals, to boost its image in the west. \u201cProponents say this will create space for free expression and improve the rights climate,\u201d he says. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t. On the contrary, there has been a drastic decline in the human-rights situation.\u201d McGeehan argues the presence of golf\u2019s European Tour, Formula One and ATP Tennis, along with Abu Dhabi\u2019s ownership of Manchester City, \u201chave provided it with cover and enabled it to present itself as liberal, western-friendly and open for business \u2013 everything Saudi Arabia now wants to do\u201d. Sport has extraordinary power to changes lives and challenge cultures. No one disputes that. It is helping people get more active, reducing violence between gangs, or even, or in the case of Football 4 Peace International, improving relations between Palestinian and Israeli children. But this sporting evangelism, which dates back at least as far as Thomas Hughes\u2019 Christian socialism of the 19th century and is propagated most loudly by the International Olympic Committee and Fifa, can only stretch so far before it looks silly. Bringing Formula One to Bahrain has not made the country substantially more liberal. Saudi Arabia, according to Amnesty, is in the midst of a \u201chuman-rights crackdown\u201d despite its modernisation claims. China has become more authoritarian since the world\u2019s eyes fixed on it during the 2008 Olympics. And while those who work in sport appear to believe the good-news stories they tell themselves, Chadwick notes when events are taken to such countries they merely \u201cinduce micro-changes within cultures rather than fundamentally make societal and macro-cultural change\u201d. Perhaps things will eventually shift. Chadwick notes there is often an internal feud between traditionalists and modernisers in Gulf states, with younger, western-educated elites more willing to embrace some reform. Whether such reforms would be enough for human rights groups is another matter. For now, though, we can say this with confidence. Holding sporting events in repressive regimes does far more to serve the political and economic interests of those in power \u2013 and swell the coffers of sporting bodies and athletes \u2013 than to improve the lot and lives of ordinary people. That does not necessarily mean Joshua should not be fighting in Saudi Arabia, or the IAAF should not stage the world championships in Doha, but heads should not be buried in the sand either."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
