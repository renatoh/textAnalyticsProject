Emails obtained by Panorama show Neil Black, then the performance director of UK Athletics, debated whether injecting Farah with L-carnitine to boost his performance at the 2014 London marathon violated \u201cthe spirit of sport\u201d. Dr Rob Chakraverty, who was heavily criticised in parliament for not recording the amount of L-Carnitine administered to Farah, also mentioned \u201cpossible side-effects\u201d in an email. Meanwhile Monday evening\u2019s Panorama also revealed the UKA\u2019s head of endurance, Barry Fudge, had gone to Switzerland to buy the legal amino acid from a contact of Alberto Salazar. When Fudge and Chakraverty appeared before a parliamentary select committee inquiry into \u201cCombatting Doping in Sport\u201d in 2017 there was no mention of the concerns they had expressed about the L-carnitine procedure, nor about the trip to Switzerland. Toni Minichiello, the coach of the Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis-Hill, said he was \u201cshocked\u201d Fudge had gone all the way to Switzerland for the supplement before suggesting the UK Athletics new chief executive, Joanna Adams, must ensure the high-performance system became more open. \u201cThe board have ushered in a new era and culture of transparency and accountability,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a great opportunity for UKA to put those words into practice, regain the trust of the sport and live up to its own values of communication, respect, integrity, quality, accountability.\u201d The MP Damian Collins, the former chair of the DCMS select committee which in 2017 examined Farah\u2019s L-carnitine injection, said the episode needed revisiting. \u201cThis very specific medicine was required, sourced at great difficulty, given against the initial advice of the doctor,\u201d he said. \u201cBut yet no one keeps any records of it and everyone decides to keep quiet about it. I think this is something that should be looked at in some seriousness.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
