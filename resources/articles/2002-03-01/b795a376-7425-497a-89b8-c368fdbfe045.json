It seems that the boxing gloves are now well and truly off and the bare-knuckle fist fight for supremacy on the island has gotten firmly underway. It has been a dramatic weekend for our remaining five citizens, whose number has now been necessarily reduced to four with the eviction of one unlucky and unsuspecting islander. If we'd had this much drama on Buki a few months ago, we could have been nominated for an Oscar. It may have taken 27 weeks to materialise but it has finally proven to be an exciting production, with not only a good plot and an action filled script but a twist that even the Coen brothers would be proud of. One of our islanders was odds-on to be evicted this week, but a daring act of desperation has prolonged his life expectancy by at least another three weeks. All remaining four islanders have realistic chances of winning, and it will be intriguing to see who will win the coveted \"I survived Buki\" t-shirt and statuette. Handicap betting appears to be the bet of choice this week, usurping the 0 or 1 goals bets in the popularity stakes, but some are still keen on the low-scoring punt, even though it's now looking dated. At the top of the leaderboard, Sean Ingle remains more than a finger length ahead of his rivals - but his lead has been considerably reduced. Once again Sean plumped for a 0 or 1 goals bet involving Middlesborough, but the bet failed to oblige. I'm beginning to think that this particular type of bet may have run its course and I'm certainly getting bored of the genre. While research shows it to be good in the long run, it doesn't make for an interesting trailer for the film of the book of the gameshow. Cue husky-voiced trailer man: \"It was an island of sin, a debauched and lonely place where nobody can hear you fill in your betting slip. Seventeen castaways stranded on a fictitious island, all with one goal - to survive - but with one huge obstacle to overcome - their own ability to place bets. A thrilling place where the fear of eviction is surpassed only by the frequency of 0 or 1 goals bets... coming soon to a cinema near nobody.\" Then again, replacing the \"0 or 1 goals bets\" bit of that last sentence with \"handicap betting\" doesn't make the film any more likely to get a general release. If we want the Academy to at least give us a lifetime achievement award, the variety and range of bets in the final few weeks must improve. Nevertheless, even though the type of bets placed did have a familiar ring to them, it was an exciting week - if not for the range of bets, for the outcomes of the matches they involved and the changes to the leader board which ensued as a result of them. Peter Fuller chose to bet on West Ham staying within a goal of Manchester United at Upton Park and he will feel hard done by that a last-minute penalty scored by Beckham scuppered the bet as the Mancunians won the match 5-3. As a result, Peter now finds himself in fourth place of the remaining four desperados, having previously been in the runner-up spot. Scott Murray continued his late assault on the title he still hopes to successfully defend with a bold \u00a320 5/1 winner that puts him right back in contention. His bet on Watford to beat Coventry by more than one goal was looking good at half-time as Watford led by the required two goals - and in the second-half they cemented their victory by adding a third. Scott is now showing his class and he seems to be taking more time and effort to research his bets, unlike a few weeks ago when his explanations for his bets were nonsensical or limited to a word or two. Bjorn Ljungren turned to Morrissey to provide inspiration for his bet, and heaven knows he got some. The draw in the Real Madrid v Barcelona match did happen but was delayed in reaching its conclusion due to a protestor handcuffing himself to the goalposts only minutes after the match had started. My theory is that this protestor was Steve Evans in a desperate attempt to force the match to be abandoned, thus ensuring his rival got the boot from the island. It was indeed a desperate attempt because the match did go ahead and Bjorn Ljungren's all-in bet won and propelled himself from potential evictee to second place in the league table. However, there was one small problem with Bjorn's bet. All-in bets were outlawed by myself a couple of months ago. I have decided that Bjorn gets to keep his winnings, however I am levying a \u00a320 fine for blatantly ignoring my directive. He may think this is harsh but I think it shows incredible leniency on my part as it ensures his place on the island and condemns his rival Steve Evans to the slow boat home. Steve Evans decided that as the race had become a sprint rather than a marathon, he would revert back to placing multiple bets. Oh dear. A better approach would have been to increase the size of his stake on singles. Of the three handicap draws he selected, only one of them won and his bet delivered less returns than it cost to place. Continuing this approach would not have served him well in the final few weeks of the competition, and even though I feel sorry for his predicament due to Mr Ljungren's failed suicide attempt, I am compelled to evict him from the island. You did well to get this far Steve, good luck in the future. The final eviction will take place in three weeks time, after which our remaining three contestants can fight it out until the season ends to see who will come up trumps and who end up as chumps. If Blue Square were offering betting on it, the odds would probably be something like this: THE STANDINGS Sean Ingle (\u00a3306.75) 6/4 fav Bjorn Lunggren (\u00a3254.60) 3/1 Scott Murray (\u00a3251.50) 11/4 Peter Fuller (\u00a3182) 4/1 I know who I'd be putting my money on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
