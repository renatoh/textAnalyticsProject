Cinven, Apax and CVC, the private equity firm that snatched Debenhams from under Permira's nose last year, are among those under stood to be re-examining the case for a bid. At least two have already contacted WH Smith's advisers, Greenhill &amp; Co. Swann, who would make \u00a32.5 million from a takeover, is herself viewed by some as a potential target. Many in the retail sector believe there are few candidates who could lead a recovery on behalf of a venture capital firm. Unveiling the shops' first loss in eight years alongside her recovery plan last week, Swann said she was not surprised by Permira's approach, which valued the company at \u00a3939m, and would not be surprised if others declared an interest, but she denied she had been contacted by any. Simon Burke, Hamley's ex-chief executive and one-half of Permira's proposed management team, said: 'The issue for shareholders is whether 375p is a good price and what they think the prospects are for this management's recovery plan. What our strategy is is irrelevant.' Shareholders were tight-lipped on whether Swann's plan is sufficiently visionary. An auction is expected, possibly with similar inducement fees to those agreed when Permira, CVC and Texas Pacific bid for Debenhams, another Greenhill client."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
