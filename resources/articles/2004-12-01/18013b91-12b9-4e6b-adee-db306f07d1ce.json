Doctors over from Seattle, who've been saving bandages for prosthetic legs. Finnish vodka women, teaching children. I'm an oaf of a man, too big and fat for saving anyone, I don't know beans. I'm just a rich bastard, I've got more money around my belt then these people will earn in a year. How does it make me feel? Uncomfortable, useless, but like all feelings they pass. A woman asked me if I'd noticed how few old Cambodians there are. I hadn't, but I do now. Do you know why? She said. No, I don't, I replied. Dead, because of the war, the hard lives. Success, Billie kills a mosquito, Etta eats a fish eye. She crunched it down, made me eat the other. We've seen menus with sparrows, dove porridge, plus a pint of ox blood to help it down. By the Siem Reap River the girls get to buy the freedom of some birds and a turtle from the cage they're in. The birds return to the sky, the turtle is thrown into the river. As soon as it hits the water, young boys jump in to get it back. People sell them, I don't know why, but riel bought them out. \"These cokes aren't the same as back home. Yeah, bottom line, not enough sugar, I've noticed,\" one man says to the other. Looking at temples, listening to people speak, olden times and now times. We have a three-day pass to Angkor Wat. I think I've seen enough carved rock, but then I see a tree holding up a temple. A 600-year-old tree holding up a temple. Makes my feet shuffle on to visit another. Angkor Wat makes you climb if you want to see the highest gods. Steep steps to a higher land, the top of a temple mountain. At the top Etta has a fit. She's shaking, she can't make it down. I've never seen her like this, this is the domain of Billie and me. Adult's mustering courage to make the descent. Tracy and Billie already down, waiting, watching. And we wait. Then Etta says, I can make it. She says it softly. We grip hands and start. After each step she says the same thing, I can make it, and we do. We hug, she's trembling at the feet of a Buddha and I'm a proud man. Cambodians walk past stroking her hair, looking at her tears. We've been staying with two orphaned boys, both sleep with teddies. This country has been blown to bits. One's lazy, one's not - that's what they told us when we first met. We just had to figure out who was who, but it wasn't hard. The owner of the guesthouse doesn't let them sleep inside: they sleep outside on hammocks. At night, guests have to wake them if they want a beer, water or anything. They lay under their mosquito nets, next to teddies, waiting to serve. As Johnny Cash would say: \"Do Lord, do Lord, do remember them.\" It's spirit time in these parts, the end of the monsoon and the water festival. Children and adults making things to float down the river with candles and incense to reach spirit gods. The river is alight with floating candles, children wading in to push them along. It's a flotilla, some burning up, some already out, all reflecting into the night water. They have fun don't they daddy? Billie says. It's the smiles all around. They don't even have EastEnders, she says. I'm still not sure what travel means to my girls, no idea. They say they like it, but sometimes I wonder. The litter on the ground is stuff they can't use. Plastic one-trip bags, but everything else is used. With six empty coke bottles, you've got yourself a gas station. Four toilet rolls, a chemist. On route 6, Siem Reap to Phnom Penh, I saw a motorbike moving a whole town. It wasn't straining at the neck, doubt if it even had a MOT. Small vans with an army on top, and on top of them tractors and on top of them other things. It hurts my neck to look. Imagine if there was a cow on the M1, they would close it. Here there are six-year-olds looking after a herd and they're all over the road. Everything just beeping, hooting, but no more fuss than that. No cones, no orange jackets, no whirring sirens. On the bus, I see a reader reading her English Cosmopolitan, not looking out of the window. The coach is full and the middle aisle is taken up by deck chair arrangements. No space has no use. If there's any going through the windscreen, it will be that lot first. Men cross-legged on top of trucks bumping along the one-lane roads. Hootsy tootsy, fine and dandy, Phnom Penh. Scooters hooters, everything on the move. One-legged stumpers holding out a hand. We break dollars into riel, so the girls can give. Four thousand riel to the dollar equals people being poor. Phnom Penh has over a million people now, when Pol Pot was doing his thing it was down to 14,000. It's not a scenic place but there's a lot to see. I go to the Genocide Museum, the S-21. Metal beds, iron balls, clubs, blood on the floor and drowning machines. I don't know whether I should tiptoe. Photos, rows and rows of them, all dead and gone. And when you come outside it's: hey mister where do you want to go now, and all I want to do is mourn for humanity. And my bells are ringing, my sad pitiful bells. And off to the killing fields I go. An orchard of skulls. I hope better things are pushing up, but I worry. If I'd wanted to I could have followed the killing fields with a M16 and some ammo. Had a go at things. You choose, could be a cow, maybe, follow that with something more. Anything if you've got the dollar. I declined, didn't have the finger for the trigger, but I met a man who did. He was whooping it up, his shoulder was hurting but he was going back for more. He had a little Rambo scarf over his head, his eyes had already gone mad. Cambodia makes my heart bang, I'll be looking out for it, reading about it, hoping for it and wishing it luck. This country needs time and sweet peace now. Etta's take We get motorbikes and it's enjoyible. I see people who fit 27 on, jam packed. It's fun sitting side saddle. I see Buddhas, I see sellers and I see the poor. When I'm walking I say, can I go on a motorcycle, and then when I'm on a motorcycle I say, can I walk? People catch birds and then we let them free. I let two birds free and Billie threw a tortousse in a lake. Billie's take I woke up ill yesterday. Mummy and daddy didn't believe me. They thought I was just seeking attention. I wasn't, I was actually ill. They are getting on my nerves, nerves, nerves. How boring writing that three times but that's what it's like. Anyway they went down for breakfast and I stayed in bed, then I was sick. I am not having a great time. Daddy goes on and on and on, typical. I know we're brats sometimes but I wish I could be back home playing football. But I'm here with boring parents. We went walking down by the river and we came to a cage with a bird. The lady says something like: \"Four birds one dollar.\" I let out two birds and a turtle. I'm sure they got the turtle back out of the river. The children are so poor and there are mines that are still in the ground that blow people up. The money is called riel even though they all use dollars. I was also blessed by a nun, so I now have a piece of string wrapped around my arm. I have learned how to do the prayers. Bow three times. Tracy's take Phnom Penh ... tales of bandits, muggers and bad boys running amok in the city. We arrive after another feast of a journey. It's dark and I'm on red alert. It's not easy finding a bed. We settle for the impersonal Hotel Asia. Check in and quickly go out in search of food. The traffic runs in all directions and there is no set flow. If the crims don't get us, a road accident will. I don't feel too good and go to bed early. The next day we find an oasis of a guesthouse - tiny rooms but lovely balconies, courtyard garden and warm people. My warning lamp goes out. I feel safe wandering alone or just with the girls. I walk around the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum by myself. I walk into former classrooms-cum-torture chambers. The energy of this place is chilling. Rows and rows of victims, numbered and photographed. I look at every face: men, women, children and even newborn babies. All tortured, then murdered. There were seven survivors from 20,000. Man is evil. I don't understand, I don't understand, I don't want to understand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
