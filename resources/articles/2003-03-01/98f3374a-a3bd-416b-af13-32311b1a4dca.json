For my generation, Provence means Brigitte Bardot and private yachts. For my parents, it meant the Promenade Anglaise in Nice and Isadora Duncan hurtling along the Corniche in an open-topped car. The Victorian English loved it - as did the continental rich, poseurs and politicians of every shape. Dig deeper and you can hear the Popes praying in Avignon and the Romans cheering performers in the great circuses of Nimes and Arles. Travellers, armies and wanderers have had to cross Provence to avoid the Alps and to get at the pleasures of the Mediterranean; they have left their marks. Visitors have often been astonished to find far more than smart yachts, suntans and old villages pressed into fields of lavender. It is an eye-stretching and unexpectedly empty area. The madness of the coast and its armies of celebrities, acolytes and caravans are all avoidable with a touch of guile - and our books of Special Places . One writer who captured the magic of Provence was Jean Giono, of The Man Who Planted Trees fame. He lived in, and wrote of, the vast spaces around Manosque. If you have enjoyed Marcel Pagnol's films (La Gloire de mon P\u00e8re, etc), you will have tasted and smelled Provence. For two recent years, I have wallowed in it while on holiday by the Lac de Sainte Croix. It is a little to the east of Manosque, close to the dramatic Gorges de Verdon and cocooned in silence, beauty and the smell of lavender. So I write with a scented memory. The country code for France is 00 33 before telephone numbers listed below. All prices are per night for two people sharing a room. Domaine du Parais La Vasta, Sospel Tel: (0)493 041578; fax: (0)493 041578 Doubles \u00a334-\u00a347 Up in the hills above the hot vulgarity of the Riviera is the Domaine du Parais, a faded Italianate mansion set in gentle isolation. It is run by a highly cultured, artistic, English-fluent trio who have reawakened the house's nineteenth-century magic. White bedrooms have pretty fabrics, antiques and views of trees where birds burst their lungs and Marcel's superb sculptures lie in wait. Come for dreamy space, good conversation or a ride into the hills on a horse. Le Castel Enchante 61 route de St Pierre de F\u00e9ric, Nice Tel: (0)493 970208; fax: (0)493 971370 Doubles \u00a362.50 High above Nice, Le Castel Enchant\u00e9 is drowned in bougainvillea in a jungle of scented garden. The 'enchanted' tag is no hyperbole. The great Italianate villa has big rooms lavish in their rich Proven\u00e7al colours. The fine furnishings and superb bathrooms put most hotels to shame. Breakfast on the terrace, splash in the pool and enjoy your hosts. L'Olivier Peintre 136 rue St Claude, St Jeannet Tel: (0)493 247891; fax: (0)493 247877 Doubles \u00a343.75-\u00a368.75; under-10s free Birdsong trills from the sub-tropical garden and Beethoven drifts through the house. From your finely-laid breakfast table there are vast and magical sea views and a terraced garden that drops down to the sheltered pool. Your hosts are a devoted couple who adore children and have the gift of making everybody feel good. So does their dog, Oomba. L'Eglantier 14 rue Campestra, Cannes Tel: (0)493 682243; fax: (0)493 382853 Doubles \u00a347-\u00a362.50 Only 15 minutes' walk from old Cannes, this cool villa is decorated in Eve's own 'retro' style. She is a mediaeval history specialist and Henri is a doctor, so both are thoroughly engaged with the world and worth getting to know. Breakfast is usually served in the garden under the spreading palm tree. One of the ground-floor rooms opens on to the garden and those upstairs have a big balcony. Wisely, they close during the star-crossed festival. La Cordeline 14 rue des Cordeliers, Brignoles, Var Tel: (0)494 591866; fax: (0)494 590029 Doubles \u00a338.75-\u00a357 You enter under a grand, arched and embossed ceiling floating above the old honeycomb tiles. The Counts of Provence lived here in the 1100s and Michel, a civilised and sociable gentleman, has a touch of their style. The house is in the quiet heart of the old town, narrow street on one side and walled garden with trees and fountain on the other. It feels almost colonial. The bedrooms are big and beautifully furnished and in winter there is a log fire by which you may read in peace. Elegant and very French. Domaine de Nestuby Cotignac, Var Tel: (0)494 046002; fax: (0)494 047922 Doubles \u00a338 This gorgeous, well-restored eighteenth-century bastide is close to perfection. Nathalie runs the house as a brilliant mix of home and guest-wing. The kids are now on the edge of the nest and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois tends the vineyards and discusses wine at dinner with sweet-natured ease. The bedrooms are light and airy, pastel-painted and Proven\u00e7al-furnished with a mix of antique and modern. Mas Saint Maurinet Route de Quinson, Montmeyan, Var Tel: (0)494 807803; fax: (0)494 807803 Doubles \u00a332.50 Deep in the unspoilt part of the Var, Mas Saint Maurinet always brings out the best in visitors. The Gonfonds are adorable and the beautiful views are of the distant Pre-Alps. The modernised farmhouse is spotless, bedrooms are smallish but typically Proven\u00e7al, and breakfast is delicious wholemeal bread, local honey and apple juice. Madame could not be kinder or more helpful. Aubanel Ginasservis, Var Tel: (0)494 801107; fax: (0)494 801104 Doubles \u00a331 This one is impossibly lovely. Your hosts are happy, civilised people whose farm - an ancient and rambling bastide - has bedrooms of almost monastic simplicity in the old tower. There are exposed stones, old tiles breathing coolness, smart bedcovers and private entrances. Dinner is delicious and largely home-grown. There are bright peacocks, friendly dogs and pure-bred Arab ponies. It is timelessly restful with a touch of the exotic. Les Means Meolans Revel Tel/fax: (0)492 810391 Doubles \u00a336 Les Means is up a bumpy dirt road deep in the interior, in the area known as the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. It is the sort of place families long to find and rarely do with so much to do that the children will never stop, yet so beautiful that just gazing is an entirely acceptable activity. Frederic is a mountain guide and ski instructor in winter and they are the perfect hosts in summer. Relaxed, easy and lovely - and terrific value. La Jarbelle Les Ribes, Les Orres Tel: (0)492 441133; fax: (0)492 441123 Doubles \u00a330. Half-board \u00a323.75 pp Michel has turned half ruins into a country house of welcome with small no-frills rooms that nevertheless have all you need. Come to ski across country or down hill, or snow-shoe where you will. In summer you can walk, hang-glide, or just soak it all in. Evenings are convivial around the communal table with your burly good-natured host. This is as far north in Provence as we take you, up a bumpy road; but it is worth the drive. La Bouscatiere Moustiers, St Mairie Tel: (0)492 746767 Fax: (0)492 746572 Doubles \u00a371.25 Many readers will identify with this type of Provence: old tiled roof, plaster walls and blue shutters, a dramatically lovely village in a dramatically lovely spot, tight up against the mountain but gazing over vast views to lavender-clad Provence. Water tumbles down through the village. This enchanting vertical house, fixed firmly to the rock since 1765, was once an oil mill. Its top floor, the seventh, opens into its garden while the bottom floor is in the village centre. Inside, the taste is exquisite, elegant, the best of Provence. L'Hostellerie Berard Rue Gabriel-Peri, La Cadiere d'Azur, Var Tel: (0)494 901143; fax: (0)494 900194 Doubles \u00a349-\u00a392.50 Back near the famous coast is an 11th-century monastery, an old bastide and a 'painters' house - all at once. It is hard to choose which to praise most - the food, the cookery and painting courses, or the hotel itself. Each bedroom is a surprise: perhaps a wrought-iron four-poster, green shutters on to the vine-covered hills, toile de Jouy curtains. The family has deep roots here. Les Perchers Isle de Porquerolles Tel: (0)607 100635; fax: (0)494 583543 Sleeps 6-8 for \u00a3625-\u00a31,190 On the tiny island of Les Porquerolles, cars are forbidden. There are pure white sandy beaches and cliffs, vineyards and woods, and atmosphere in gallons. The little self-catering house, in a large crumbling garden with vines, peach tree, patio-terrace and faded bamboo awning, is pure 1960s, with a bathroom so old-fashioned as to have become fashionable again. Floors are porridge tiles, walls are of strong-coloured paint, bedrooms are comfortable and bourgeois and the kitchen is light and comfortingly familiar. Marvellous for families. Le Mas de Foncaudette La Lombarde, Puyvert, Vaucluse Tel/fax: (0)490 084251 Doubles \u00a346.25-\u00a374 On an estate that grows grapes, olives and lavender, you will find the stones, the light, the colours of Provence. Weathered by five centuries, the house has a clutch of bewitchingly decorated rooms, drag-painted and stained-furnitured, with crazy lights, books, objets, and colourful bathrooms. A pool, an exotic inner court yard, a great-tabled dining hall - all held together by the live-wire, rainbow Anny and her artist daughter Amandine. Montsalier Banon Tel/fax: (0)492 732361 Doubles \u00a343.75 This apparently modest old house is a surprise: it unfolds to reveal a place of grandeur. It has a vast flourish of a dining hall, a tower, a pigeon loft and fascinating hosts who are an unusual mix of shyness, extroversion and humour. Wisteria clads the courtyard, trees shelter the garden, beams sail above the canopied bed of a tower room - the whole house overflows with character. Come breathe the thyme-wafted air of a venerable hillside village. Mas de la Brune Eygali\u00e8res en Provence, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne Tel: (0)490 906767; fax: (0)490 959921 Doubles \u00a395-\u00a3143 Pick your quiet corner in this magical, elegant place built to an alchemist's design in 1572 - pure Proven\u00e7al Renaissance art. Snarling gargoyles, carved heads for anger and gluttony, and the four evangelists sit alongside a magnificent circular staircase. The entire ground floor is vaulted; a monumental fireplace graces the sitting-room and a giant olive press presides over the dining room. Big, baldaquin-bedded bedrooms, beamed ceilings and sober sophistication. La Barjaquiere St Pierre de Vassols, Vaucluse Tel: (0)490 624800; fax: (0)490 624806 Doubles \u00a362.50-\u00a393.75 A typical seventeenth-century town house, it nevertheless has the knack of astonishing you: a swimming pool in the flowered entrance courtyard and then an indoor pool surrounded by trompe l'oeil visions of terracotta pots overflowing with colour. The place, which has had quantities of love lavished upon it, sings with warmth and colour. Beams, nooks, crannies, mezzanines and terraces inspired this maze of an interior. There is a quiet sitting space, poetry on antique tables, apricot floor-tiles and pale-yellow waxed walls. The hotel seems to hold 100 layers of shimmering light, and two delightful hosts. La Bastide de Voulonne Cabri\u00e8res d'Avignon, Vaucluse Tel: (0)490 767755; fax: (0)490 767756 Doubles \u00a367-\u00a3133 The blue shutters on a faded wall across a sea of lavender and great hanging trees reminds me of those Pagnol films. The food is local and sublime, you can attend a two-day truffle course and your hosts are a young couple with children. Why return home? Your breakfast will be on the inner terrace to the soothing sound of a fountain; your dinner will be at one long table in the big dining room whose centrepiece is the old bread oven. Tiled floors, natural colours on the walls, ancient villages on those Luberon Mountains. Lastly, a park for a garden, with a pool as well. Auberge de Reillanne Reillane Tel/fax: (0)492 764595 Doubles\u00a327.50-\u00a343, half-board \u00a338 pp The owner, the gentle, delicate and smiling Monique Balmand, loves nothing better than to receive guests in her magical house. Solid, square, lovely and eighteenth-century, the house reassures and fills you with positive energy. Bedrooms are large and airy, done in cool, restful colours with big cupboards and rattan furniture. There are beams and whitewashed walls, books and big bathrooms. Come for meditative walks in the hills or to pretend that you are writing that novel. L'Eveche Rue de L'Eveche, Vaison la Romaine, Vaucluse Tel: (0)490 361346; fax: (0)490 363243 Doubles \u00a343-\u00a347.50 This would be a wonderful place to start or finish. Via narrow cobbled streets, you come to this beautifully furnished house that was once part of the seventeenth-century Bishop's Palace. The Verdiers are charming and cultured people - he an architect, she a teacher - who will provide you with English and French newspapers at breakfast and long views of the Roman bridge from your serene, whitewashed, beamed, terracotta-floored bedrooms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
