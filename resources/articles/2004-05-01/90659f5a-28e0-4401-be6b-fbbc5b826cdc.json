If this was the American sit-com, that episode might be called \"The one where Jason wears the wrong shirt\". For the 35-year-old will pack down against England for the Barbarians and lock horns with Northampton's Robbie Morris, one of many English front-rows who have failed to dislodge him in the past 14 years. Morris and the rest of this England shadow team may have been forgiven a gulp or two when they saw the Barbarians line-up yesterday. A stellar side containing two former All Black captains, including tomorrow's skipper Anton Oliver, a former Springbok captain in Andre Vos and the current leader of Ireland and the world's top centre Brian O'Driscoll is not going to capitulate in the way that the invitation side did in losing 42-0 to Wales in midweek. It also seems unlikely that England can repeat their 53-29 victory over the 2002 Barbarians at Twickenham when James Simpson-Daniel showed Jonah Lomu a clean pair of heels. Hoping to emulate Simpson-Daniel tomorrow will be London Irish's Paul Sackey and Gloucester's Marcel Garvey. Whether Hugh Vyvyan's raw-looking English pack can shift enough ball their way is another matter. Sir Clive Woodward, the England head coach who is grooming most of this team for the 2007 World Cup, will grit his teeth if he loses any more players for the trip to Canada next month. So he will closely monitor the loose-head Mike Worsley's progress against the Springbok Cobus Visagie. Woodward is not treating the match as an end-of-season jolly. \"We have prepared this team as if we were playing Australia and New Zealand in full Tests,\" he said. \"We want to win.\" England: Horak ; Sackey (both London Irish), Noon (Newcastle), Sorrell (Saracens), Garvey (Gloucester); Walder (Newcastle), Walshe (Sale); Worsley (Harlequins), Regan (Leeds), Morris (Northampton), Cornwell , Brown (both Gloucester), Hyde (Leeds), Hazell (Gloucester), Vyvyan (Newcastle, capt).
