Some of the butterflies were seeking nectar from the purple-blue scabious flowers that lined the path. The butterflies' wings looked almost black, indicating that they had probably just emerged, and you had to look close to see the false eye markings. The path led through the birch and rowan woodland to the RSPB hide, and the only sound was the water trickling down the burns from the hillside. The view from the hide was idyllic, with the broad sedge beds running along the edge of the woodland and the water flat calm but dotted with the rises of brown trout. A Slavonian grebe was busy fishing, with two well-grown young of the year \u2013 I call them grebelets \u2013 swimming nearby. Then the harsh croaks of two herons rising from the sedges and looking so ungainly in flight. It seemed difficult to imagine that this loch and the grebes are still subject to one of the great mysteries of the Highlands. In the last few years the success rate of these rare breeding birds has fluctuated, and last year it reached an all-time low, with no young fledged. This year six pairs have bred, and six young should now fledge \u2013 but why the modest success this year? The intense studies on the problem have indicated various reasons. Tiny cameras have filmed otters taking eggs, young and adults from the nests; crows and gulls have been seen taking their toll; but no single factor seems to be the answer. One clue this year has been the fact that in May and June the weather was good, which meant the usual heavy downpours had not made the water levels fluctuate. The surveys continue, but the answer still seems inconclusive, although if the weather is to blame perhaps floating artificial islands would help. They would provide nest sites, whatever the level of the water."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
