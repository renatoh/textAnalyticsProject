In a crowd of several dozen people, around 10 protesters brandished the flags as the presidential motorcade arrived. One US flag was also waved. There were also some fans of the president in the crowd, including one person who held a sign expressing love for Obama, the first African American president. Obama, who was arriving in Oklahoma for a two-day tour, has criticised the flag as a symbol of hate. A week ago, the flag was removed from the grounds of the South Carolina statehouse in Columbia, after Governor Nikki Haley signed legislation to remove the controversial banner. The flag \u2013 a symbol of the states that fought against the union in the American civil war between 1861 and 1865 \u2013 has come under renewed focus following the murder of nine African Americans at a church in Charleston last month. Dylann Roof, the suspect in those killings, was linked to a racist manifesto posted online. Roof was pictured with the Confederate flag in several photos posted to the same website as the manifesto. The Confederate flag was removed from Oklahoma\u2019s state capitol in 1988, for renovations. It has since never returned. A group of Confederate flag supporters were also out in force in Durant, before the president arrived in the town. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna stand down from our heritage. You know, this flag\u2019s not racist. And I know a lot of people think it is, but it\u2019s really not,\u201d one protester, Trey Johnson, told NewsChannel 4. He had driven three hours from Texas to join the protest. \u201cIt\u2019s just a southern thing,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s it.\u201d According to local news organisations, a man who calls himself the \u201cblack rebel\u201d was responsible for organising the Confederate flag demonstration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
