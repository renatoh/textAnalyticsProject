Says who? Says David Cameron himself. In the interview with him we publish today, the prime minister expresses regret that the referendum campaign has been so dominated by \u201cblue-on-blue stuff\u201d and laments the media obsession with what he calls the \u201cDave and Boris show\u201d. I agree. This decision is far too serious to be treated as another act in a Tory psychodrama and much more attention ought to be paid to non-Conservative voices in the days remaining before the vote. From the very beginning, I have argued that the choice facing us is far too important to be left to a slugfest between rival factions of the Tory party. Darkly entertaining as their mud-wrestling might be, the whole country, not just the minority of it that occupies the blue segment of the political spectrum, ought to be engaged with this momentous question. I have also argued for months \u2013 the unkind might even say I have rather banged on about it \u2013 that the behaviour of Labour voters will be critical to the outcome. It is highly probable that the referendum will be decided by them. How many of them will turn up? How will those who do turn up divide between In and Out? We have a good idea about what to expect from the metropolitan, university-educated Labour supporter who is relatively well- off or with good prospects of becoming so. They are heavily for In and they are very likely to turn up to vote. But what about the rest of the Labour base, especially the party\u2019s traditional, white, working-class support? The Outers have always entertained hopes that their anti-immigration messages would suck many of those voters their way. It is not a coincidence that a lot of the Leave campaign\u2019s material is coloured red. At last \u2013 better late than never, I suppose \u2013 everyone is finally waking up to the threat that the referendum could be lost among these voters. It is a source of rising anxiety in Downing Street, among Remain strategists and within Labour itself. A lot of the party\u2019s MPs were shocked by the poll suggesting that only half of voters identifying with Labour knew which side the party was on and an alarmingly high proportion thought Labour backed Out. Labour MPs are overwhelmingly for In, as are the party\u2019s members, but this has simply not communicated itself to their voters. Some Labour MPs cast the blame on journalists for failing to give them the means to convey their messages to the electorate. For once, I have a bit of sympathy with politicians complaining about the media. A useful study from Loughborough University calculates that Labour voices have been present in less than 4% of TV coverage of the campaign. It also finds that not a single Labour figure has made the top 10 of most frequently reported politicians. The press is a law unto itself, but the broadcasters are under an obligation to give fair airtime to the principal party of opposition. Some of this is media bias. Not pro-Tory bias, but bias towards excitement. Journalists find the gory spectacle of Tories gouging each other much more thrilling than a Labour person making a speech saying what you\u2019d expect a Labour person to say. It is also because \u2013 and in this respect Labour people have to look to themselves \u2013 the best attackers of Tories have been other Tories. The zinger of the night at the expense of Boris Johnson during Thursday\u2019s ITV debate came not from Angela Eagle or Nicola Sturgeon. It came from another Tory, the cabinet minister Amber Rudd, when she remarked: \u201cThe only number Boris is interested in is Number 10.\u201d When the former mayor of London and his fellow Brexiters Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith calculated that they might seduce some voters for Out by posing as the champions of the NHS, it was a Tory who skewered them when Sir John Major said: \u201cThe NHS is about as safe with them as a pet hamster would be with a hungry python.\u201d While the airwaves have boomed to the sound of Tory clashing with Tory, Labour people have struggled to get a word in edgeways. Thoughtful Labour MPs acknowledge that at least some of the fault lies with themselves for failing to deliver compelling messages with the punch to cut through. That starts at the top. Jeremy Corbyn was late to the fray, took a week\u2019s holiday in the middle of the campaign and has never dispelled the impression that he is, at very best, a half-hearted supporter of continued membership of the EU. Some of his more conspiratorially minded colleagues even speculate that the Labour leader secretly yearns for an Out vote in the belief that the mayhem that would follow would be to his advantage. There is one merit in the Labour leader\u2019s grudging support for EU membership. It is probably a reflection of the feelings of quite a lot of voters. But it does not exactly inspire them with reasons to cast a ballot for In. Labour has allowed itself to be distracted by spats about whether or not its people should share platforms with Tories. It has also been divided at a more profound level between those who have wanted to be full throated in their support for membership and other Labour figures who fear that expressions of enthusiasm for the EU will accelerate a divorce between the party and those of its traditional supporters who don\u2019t like immigration. Labour now needs to sort itself out and quickly. Over the coming days, the Tory side of the Remain campaign plans to pull back a bit in the hope that this will create the space for more non-Tory politicians to be heard, especially Labour ones. Mr Cameron tells us that he is happy \u2013 in fact, he sounds even desperate \u2013 to retreat from the limelight to give other voices in the coalition for Remain \u201ca chance to speak up\u201d. His strategists call this \u201cclearing the stage\u201d. This is a recognition by the Tory leader that, in so much as he is persuasive at all with Labour voters, there is not a great deal more he can do to try to mobilise another party\u2019s supporters. That responsibility now falls on Labour and its allies in the trade union movement. If this is to work as desired, it will not be enough to clear the stage. Labour will need to put a strong cast on that stage and they must have a compelling script. As it happens, Labour can muster excellent arguments for a vote to Remain. These arguments are distinctive from those made by David Cameron, as they have to be because Labour needs to make a Labour case to appeal to voters on the left of the spectrum. There are also encouraging signs that the party has finally become seized by urgency. Panic is the mother of action. One territory where Labour has a strong argument to make to those of its voters flirting with the Outers is obviously workers\u2019 rights. It is a good idea to warn about the consequences for them of \u201cTory Brexit\u201d, a smart phrase coined by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. This has the advantage of appealing to the tribal impulses of the Labour clan. It also has the merit of being true. The leaders of Out have a vision of what they would do to a post-EU Britain. That vision is of a shrunken-state Britain inhaling the fumes from a bonfire of regulation. What they disparage as \u201cred tape\u201d are the hard-won employment, anti-discrimination, safety and social rights that millions of people rely on to protect them from rapacious, capricious and incompetent bosses. This is fruitful ground for Labour, and an argument for EU membership that even Mr Corbyn can be comfortable making, but that doesn\u2019t mean Labour should confine itself to that ground. The party can and should range more broadly in making the case for Remain. Labour also needs to be present in the big, overarching argument about what Brexit would do to trade, investment and jobs. There\u2019s no dispute between the independent authorities who have examined the consequences that it would be bad for the economy. They only differ about just how bad it would be. If Britain departs the EU, the price won\u2019t be paid by Boris Johnson and all the little Johnsons. They have the wealth to be insulated from the turmoil that would be unleashed by Brexit. The bill for satisfying his ambitions would be paid by people on lower and middle incomes in jobs lost and opportunities denied. That ought to be a core Labour message to its supporters. The Tory leader is inviting Labour to have the stage. That unusual offer is another reminder that this decision transcends the normal laws of politics. Labour needs to seize this moment and use the space to make its case for Remain. If Britain leaves the EU, the finger of blame will first point at David Cameron. Then it will turn to the Labour party. In the time remaining before the day of decision, Labour\u2019s voice is going to be critical, quite possibly decisive. It needs to speak with as much passion and conviction as the party can muster. By 23 June, no one should be in any doubt about which side Labour is on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
