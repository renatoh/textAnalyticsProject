But there is a young rival hoping to outfox Fox and catch the US president\u2019s wandering media eye. The obscure One America News Network (OAN) makes up for its lack of clout or viewers by covering every Trump utterance, recycling conspiracy theories, downplaying Russian threats, bashing the mainstream media and championing the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d agenda. Most Americans have not noticed, but the most powerful one has. The president rewards OAN with shout-outs and access wildly out of sync with its reach, leading some observers to suspect that he is playing OAN and Fox News off one another to ensure their undying affection. It is a stark example of how Trump as media commentator cuts both ways: while deriding mainstream outlets as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d, he champions those that offer flattering coverage. Others, however, condemn OAN as a \u201cFox News wannabe\u201d that is run on a shoestring with a team of underpaid and inexperienced staff. An article on the Daily Beast website last month was headlined \u201cThe Hell of Working at Trump\u2019s New Favorite Network\u201d, based on interviews with four former OAN employees. One ex-video producer, Ernest Champell, said he was told on his first day at work, \u201cYeah, we like Russia here,\u201d and recalled how the network spread conspiracy theories and ran \u201chit jobs\u201d on politicians. He quit after four months. The ex-staff blamed editorial meddling by OAN\u2019s founder, Robert Herring Sr, 77, a millionaire who made his fortune printing circuit boards. Based in San Diego, California, in 2004 he launched Wealth TV, a cable channel now called AWE (A Wealth of Entertainment) that offers shows such as Dream Cruises and Marijuana Miracle Cure. In 2013, on Independence Day, Herring added One America News. Or, to be more accurate, is that One America News Network? The URL for \u201cOAN\u201d had already been acquired and, though not in use, would cost $200,000 or more, whereas \u201cOANN\u201d was available for $15-20. Robert\u2019s son Charles Herring, 53, president of Herring Broadcasting, admitted: \u201cSo we have a little branding issue, to tell you the truth. People that watch TV know us as OAN; Twitter followers know us as OANN.\u201d The network struggled but jumped aboard the Trump train in the 2016 presidential election. It became the first channel to carry the celebrity billionaire businessman\u2019s campaign speeches live and in full, a luxury not afforded to other candidate. This policy has continued during his presidency; not even Fox News broadcasts every speech uninterrupted. \u201cWe\u2019re the only network that I know of that will carry the president\u2019s speech in its entirety and, regardless of who\u2019s the president,\u201d Charles Herring said. \u201cI really don\u2019t care who the president is: left-leaning, right-leaning, you like him, you hate him, it just seems like that\u2019s a function of the news.\u201d He added: \u201cFor that reason we get accused of being a Trump supporter. There\u2019s no doubt that we think some of the results that are coming from this president are simply remarkable and they\u2019re just numbers: unemployment down to 3.2%. That\u2019s a wonderful thing and you would think that we could all applaud that. Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Herring claims that OAN \u2013 which has about 150 staff including six in Washington \u2013 offers an antidote to other cable news networks\u2019 emphasis on talking heads and heated argument. CNN has abandoned straight news in favor of advocacy, he claims, but OAN faces the same charge. Its pundits have included the conservative firebrand Tomi Lahren and Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and it has served up documentaries such as Betrayal at Benghazi: The Cost of Hillary Clinton\u2019s Dereliction and Greed. Its two talkshows, Tipping Point with Liz Wheeler and The Daily Ledger with Graham Ledger, lean heavily right. When the White House revoked the CNN correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s hard pass, Herring announced that OAN would join the court battle \u2013 on the administration\u2019s side. The approach has earned Trump\u2019s patronage and given OAN an ability to punch above its weight. It claims to be the fourth-rated cable news network, trailing Fox News, MSNBC and CNN but ahead of CNN Headline News, Fox Business Channel, CNBC and BBC World News \u2013 though other networks dispute this. OAN says it has 35 million subscribers and its total viewers at any given time can range from about 150,000 to upwards of half a million. In August 2017, during a joint press conference with the president of Finland, Trump took a question from OAN\u2019s White House correspondent and said: \u201cI want to congratulate you on the network. It\u2019s a great network.\u201d In June 2018, at a press conference in Singapore, he said: \u201cThank you for the nice way you treat us. We appreciate it. Really, it\u2019s very good. It\u2019s really beautiful what you do.\u201d The president has also mentioned OAN 25 times on Twitter since October 2015, including seven tweets in March, April and May. The most recent: \u201cAlso, congratulations to @OANN on the great job you are doing and the big ratings jump (\u201cthank you President Trump\u201d)!\u201d OAN secured a seat in the White House briefing room and its journalists are regularly called upon to ask questions at press conferences. Herring said: \u201cI\u2019ve instructed our reporters they can ask any question; it should be a meaningful question on behalf of the viewers. It shouldn\u2019t be to raise their profile or anything along that line and it must be asked in the most respectful manner. And if you do that, the president of the United States engages.\u201d Last month Emerald Robinson, OAN\u2019s chief White House correspondent, bagged an interview with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and this week she was the first journalist called upon by Trump at his joint press conference with Polish president Andrzej Duda (Trump: \u201cWe\u2019ll take a few questions. Emerald? OAN.\u201d Robinson: \u201cThank you, Mr President.\u201d Trump: \u201cThank you.\u201d) Robinson was previously an actor \u2013 the Internet Movie Database lists her in the cast of the 2016 Jennifer Garner film Miracles from Heaven in the role of \u201cWoman with Big Hair\u201d. She tweeted on Wednesday: \u201cPresident Trump got Mexico to make a deal by threatening them with tariffs. He did it all by himself, folks. The Democrats were against it. The Senate Republicans were against it. The media was against it. Big Business was against it. None of that mattered. All it took was Trump.\u201d It has not all been plain sailing. In March, OAN felt the sting of rejection. It tweeted: \u201cPresident Trump recently gave a speech, thanking his supporters in the media. Not a single mention of One America News -- one of his GREATEST supporters...@OANN calls bullshit...\u201d The tweet seemed to give the game away and has since been deleted. Challenged about the incident, Herring is content to throw his father under the bus. \u201cI understand the frustration and why the tweet was sent out. I didn\u2019t appreciate the way it was done; it was sent out by my father, but so be it. That happens.\u201d But media watchdogs detect something more sinister about the network. OAN\u2019s Washington team includes Jack Posobiec, once described by the New York Times as \u201ca pro-Trump activist notorious for his amateur sleuthing into red herrings like the \u2018Pizzagate\u2019 hoax and a conspiracy theory involving the murder of a Democratic aide\u201d. Dan Cassino, a political scientist at Fairleigh Dickinson University, said: \u201cHe is rightly regarded as someone who represents the worst of the far-right movement online. To describe him as a troll would be accurate. I think he has been thrown off some platforms which, in these circles, is regarded as a badge of honour.\u201d Cassino, author of Fox News and American Politics, added: \u201cOAN are trying to reach people who feel they can\u2019t trust the mainstream media, they can\u2019t trust Fox News, they can\u2019t trust social media. OAN believe Fox has become too centrist or too establishment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
