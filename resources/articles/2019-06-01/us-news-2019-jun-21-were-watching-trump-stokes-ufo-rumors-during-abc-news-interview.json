Donald Trump kicked the latest round off last week when, responding to a question about the rise in reports of unidentified aircraft by US navy pilots, he revealed that he had been briefed on UFO sightings. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably \u2013 I want them to think whatever they think,\u201d the president told ABC News. \u201cThey do say, and I\u2019ve seen, and I\u2019ve read, and I\u2019ve heard. And I did have one very brief meeting on it. But people are saying they\u2019re seeing UFOs. Do I believe it? Not particular.\u201d Asked if he would be told if extraterrestrial life was found, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re watching, and you\u2019ll be the first to know.\u201d Earlier this year, the US navy revised its pilot guidelines on how to document \u201cunauthorised and/or unidentified aircraft\u201d, after a spike in such reports. On Wednesday, Politico reported that three senators including Mark Warner, vice-chair of the senate intelligence committee, had been given a classified Pentagon briefing about navy encounters with unidentified aircraft. \u201cIf naval pilots are running into unexplained interference in the air, that\u2019s a safety concern Senator Warner believes we need to get to the bottom of,\u201d a spokesperson said. Interest in unidentified aerial phenomena has been building since 2017, when the Pentagon established a programme dedicated to analysing the subject, interviewing sailors and pilots about their experiences. On Thursday, UFO speculation hit Kansas City after several people said two mysterious, white, hazy and elongated \u201corbs\u201d had appeared above the city\u2019s airport. A local TV station tweeted a series of photographs of the purported mysterious objects. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken several calls in our newsroom about these two orbs spotted in the Kansas City sky tonight,\u201d KMBC said. \u201cThis picture was taken near KCI Airport.\u201d The National Weather Service declared itself flummoxed. \u201cWe honestly have no explanation for the floating objects over Kansas City,\u201d it wrote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
