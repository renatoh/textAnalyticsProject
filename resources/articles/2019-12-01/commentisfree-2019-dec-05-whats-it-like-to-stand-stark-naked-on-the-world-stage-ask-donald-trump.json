Ask Donald Trump", "bodyText": "You know that classic nightmare where you\u2019re at work and everyone is talking but none of them say the obvious: you\u2019re stark naked. Donald Trump is living that hellacious dream every time he steps in front of the women and men who make up the world\u2019s leaders. Stripped of his usual protections inside the White House, Trump exposes himself on the world stage at every conceivable opportunity. This week\u2019s Nato summit in London was no exception, adding itself to the long list of denuded nonsense that erupts in front of every international figure. First he attempted to joke with President Emmanuel Macron of France about Isis. \u201cWould you like some nice Isis fighters? I can give them to you. You can take everyone you can,\u201d said the man pretending to be the leader of the free world. \u201cLet\u2019s be serious,\u201d said Macron, dispensing with a translator as he shut down the clown show. \u201cThe very large number of fighters you have on the ground are Isis fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq, and the region.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a world leader at a Nato summit to know that Isis fighters and jihadist sympathizers pose a serious threat to the streets of Europe\u2019s capital cities. You just have to be a grownup who pays attention to the news, such as the fatal stabbings on London Bridge just last week. But that may be asking too much of the man-baby who watches TV somewhere close to the Oval Office. The widespread expectation that Trump will embarrass himself does not make his nakedness any less shocking. Even after all these years of bare-faced tomfoolery. So it was Macron and his French-speaking ally Justin Trudeau, accompanied by a jolly-hockey-sticks Boris Johnson, who all seemed to be dumping on Donald at Buck House on Tuesday. \u201cYou just watched his team\u2019s jaws drop to the floor,\u201d Trudeau said, dropping his hand towards floor in a performance that also seemed to involve a glass of beer. It was hard to know what Trump-induced jaw-dropper he was talking about. There are so many to choose from. Was it the head-wrenching answer a few minutes after his comments on Isis fighters, when Trump was asked if he supported the protesters in Iran? \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on that. But the answer is no. But I don\u2019t want to comment on that,\u201d said Trump, contradicting himself twice in the space of just 20 words. Then again, maybe Trudeau was talking about the way Trump explained how he betrayed his Kurdish allies in Syria by pretending that \u201cwe\u2019ve captured the oil and taken the oil\u201d. Or maybe he was talking about the way Trump explained at a Nato summit that he understood why Turkey was buying Russian missiles. \u201cSo, you know, there are two sides to the story,\u201d claimed the president who consistently prefers the Russian side of the story. Of all the threats facing the world \u2013 the climate crisis, the rise of Putin-style politicians, refugees, terrorism \u2013 none have played on Trump\u2019s mind quite as much as the thought that the world might be laughing at America. \u201cWe need a President who isn\u2019t a laughing stock to the entire World,\u201d Trump tweeted two years before he became just that. \u201cWe need a truly great leader, a genius at strategy and winning. Respect!\u201d Sadly, Trump never became the second half of his own tweet, no matter what he sees in the mirror each morning. Instead he became the kind of leader who bragged to the United Nations how awesome his administration was. To be specific, he told last year\u2019s general assembly that it was more awesome than \u201calmost any other administration in the history of our country\u201d. At which point, the massed ranks of world leaders started guffawing. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that reaction, but that\u2019s OK,\u201d he said. It\u2019s never OK for this fragile snowflake of a tough guy. When asked about Trudeau\u2019s laughter on Wednesday, Trump melted once again. \u201cWell he\u2019s two-faced,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd honestly with Trudeau, he\u2019s a nice guy. I find him to be a very nice guy. But you know the truth is that I called him out on the fact that he\u2019s not paying 2%. And I guess he\u2019s not very happy about it.\u201d Yeah, that must be it. Totally nailed him on that one. Sitting beside him, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, was surely impressed with the savage indictment of the size of Canada\u2019s military spending. But she subtly masked her admiration by looking like an anxious patient expecting a bad prognosis. There was plenty to feel queasy about. Trump once again heaped praise on himself for carving up the Kurds, in alliance with the Russians, Syrians and Turks. \u201cMaybe someday they\u2019ll give me credit, but probably not,\u201d he whined. \u201cBut that worked out well. They\u2019ve been trying to do this for a hundred years. That border is a mess for a long time.\u201d It worked out less well for America\u2019s Kurdish allies, but hey. Perhaps someday they\u2019ll also give him credit for his Greenland gambit, which he suggested would be part of his forthcoming talks with the Danish prime minister. \u201cDo you still want to buy Greenland,\u201d asked one cheeky reporter. \u201cShe must be in the real estate business,\u201d said the non-laughingstock president. \u201cThat\u2019s a very good question.\u201d After all those good questions about his genius at strategy and winning, Trump wimped out of his final press conference. \u201cI think we\u2019ve done plenty of press conferences,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless you\u2019re demanding a press conference, we\u2019ll do one, but I think we\u2019ve answered plenty of questions.\u201d For a split second, Boris Johnson gulped hard at the thought of one more chance for Trump to blow the British general election. And so the naked emperor declared he would get dressed, unless you thought he was already wearing something fancy, in which case he\u2019d stay happily inside his birthday suit. Respect!
