The 93-year-old British naturalist made the direct link between the ongoing bushfires and climate change during an interview with the BBC published on Thursday. \u201cAs I speak, south-east Australia is on fire. Why? Because the temperatures of the Earth are increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been putting things off year after year. We\u2019ve been raising targets, saying \u2018oh well, if we do it in the next 20 years \u2026\u2019 the moment of crisis has come.\u201d More than 10.7m hectares of land have burnt so far in the Australian bushfires, including 80% of the Blue Mountains, and 50% of the Gondwana world heritage rainforests. While Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has talked down suggestions there are climate change deniers in his party, several Australian government MPs have continued to downplay the role of global heating on the bushfire crisis, and Morrison has attempted to pivot the debate from acting on climate change to resilience and adaptation. Attenborough said the world can no longer prevaricate and delay decisions, and the change needed to be made not by appealing to optimism but by highlighting it is a life or death decision. \u201cThis is not just having nice little debates and arguments and then coming away with a compromise. This is an urgent problem that has to be solved,\u201d Attenborough said. \u201cAnd what is more is that we know how to do it, that\u2019s the paradoxical thing, that we are refusing to take steps that we know have to be taken. \u201cAnd every year that passes makes those steps more and more difficult to achieve.\u201d He said China needed to step forward and announce it is curbing carbon output because of climate change, and everyone else would \u201cfall into line\u201d. \u201cThat would be the big change that one could hope would happen.\u201d He said the public mood had already shifted. \u201cPeople can see the problem, particularly young people can see the problem, and that must force governments to take action.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
