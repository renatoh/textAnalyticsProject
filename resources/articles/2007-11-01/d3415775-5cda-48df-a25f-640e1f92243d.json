Although the globe as a whole will benefit, as a lid is kept on carbon emissions, the countries to get the biggest dividends will be those that create CCS plants first, and then export their skills and technology. 'There is a race going on,' says John Gale, senior consultant at the International Energy Agency's greenhouse gas research and development programme. The US, Australia, Norway and the UK are the front-runners, but the smart money seems to be on the US at the moment, which may have a plant in commercial operation by 2012. This month, the UK government will announce a competition to launch its first full-scale CCS pilot scheme. It is not clear how much money will be awarded, but geologist Professor Stuart Haszeldine of Edinburgh University is hoping for \u00a3300m - and in the quickest timescale possible. 'Being among the first in the world is important,' he says. Politicians around the world have woken up to the potential of CCS as a new money-spinning industry. The port of Rotterdam, for instance, entry point to Europe for oil and gas, is seeking to position itself as an energy hub, playing an important role in the Netherlands' CCS aspirations. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond is a keen supporter of carbon capture - and, no doubt, sees the role that CCS, linked to the North Sea, could play financially in supporting his dream of an independent Scotland. And Gordon Brown has talked of Britain leading in 'carbon capture, clean fuels and new environmental technologies'. Many countries are now involved in carbon capture, but linking it to power plants is its most significant use when trying to peg back carbon dioxide emissions. Emission cuts of 90 per cent seem possible under some designs. In electricity plants, CO2 emissions would be filtered off and buried. Edinburgh University calculates that for the UK, the extra costs of CCS-powered electricity would amount to \u00a330 per household per year, provided power companies take no extra profits. The UK could have had a plant - the BP gas-fired plant in Peterhead, near Aberdeen - ready to go with CCS for 2009. But the government, particularly the Treasury under Chancellor Gordon Brown, did not prioritise that type of CCS, or offer financial assistance, and BP abandoned the plan in May 2007. CCS plants will be expensive to build - the best part of \u00a31bn each - and, in most areas of the world, the companies behind them will be seeking some government finance for the prototypes. In the UK, the winner of the funding competition is expected to be announced in October 2008 - with the plants up and running for 2012/14. Coal-fired, rather than gas-fired, power plants will be the main users of CCS systems around the world, according to Gale. India and China, for example, have huge indigenous coal supplies, and so will want to use them. The retro-fit technology favoured by the government for the UK competition is seen as ideal for such applications. Of the four front-runners, Norway is the only one developing a gas-fired CCS system as its main project. The UK has both gas and coal plants, but the funding through the competition will be for a coal plant. The US and Australia are both moving down the coal route. American Electric Power is one US company to watch. It is now developing an innovative, potentially highly cost-effective, system that uses ammonia to capture carbon, which by 2012 could be fitted to a plant in Oklahoma. The company is not seeking funding from the government. AEP is also a member of the FutureGen consortium, which is developing a different type of CCS scheme to convert coal to hydrogen and electricity, which is getting US Department of Energy funding. Another member of the FutureGen alliance is the China Huaneng Group, China's version of Gazprom. Australia, meanwhile, hopes to open its first CCS project in Queensland for 2012. It is also focused on rapid growth abroad. 'Australia regards itself as exporter of energy to the south-east Asian market,' says Gale. The UK is keen to become the leader in the EU, but if it wants to achieve this it cannot afford to delay. The Netherlands was held back from becoming the EU pioneer only by a dispute with the European Commission on funding from the Dutch government. In the UK, four or five projects are expected to enter the government funding competition. Big names involved include Eon, RWE, Scottish Power and Scottish and Southern Energy. The winner could dominate the sector for decades to come."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
