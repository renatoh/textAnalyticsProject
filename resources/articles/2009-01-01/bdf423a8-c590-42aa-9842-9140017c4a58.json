Nemanja Vidic and Dimitar Berbatov scored the first and last goals of Manchester United's crushing 3\u20130 victory following a corner and a free-kick respectively and Scolari has decided to act. Starting at Southend United tomorrow night, in the FA Cup third-round replay, his players will change to a zonal defensive marking system. \"If we are wrong now, it's more my mistake because now, it's my system,\" said Scolari. He had tried to introduce the zonal system, which is more commonly seen on the continent, upon his arrival at Chelsea, only to be encouraged, partly by his players, to revert to man-to-man marking. Scolari is now going back to his instincts. \"The responsibility is for the group,\" he added. \"One man wrong [in a man-to-man system], and you are wrong. Now, it's seven or eight players inside the box.\" Scolari believes that Chelsea's only problem during what has been a miserable run of results has been their vulnerability at set pieces. This is a contentious view. Chelsea's players are hugely concerned by Scolari's training regime which, many of them feel, is not sufficiently rigorous and has left them lacking match sharpness for the full 90 minutes. It was indeed shocking to see the difference between their performance in the first 30 minutes at Old Trafford and the last. Is it coincidence that they have conceded late goals in their last three fixtures? Scolari, in his previous roles as the manager of Portugal and Brazil, was used to his players being delivered to him in prime condition. He could concentrate on the tactics. But at Chelsea, the noises coming out of the Cobham training ground are that he is struggling to grasp the requisite levels of physical preparation. The departure of Steve Clarke, the former assistant manager, has been a blow in this regard. Scolari has made surprising tactical decisions from time to time and on Sunday he moved Frank Lampard, perhaps his only in-form midfielder, to the left flank. He said that the decision had backfired. \"I am responsible for the second half and to concede the two goals,\" he said. \"I try to change the result ... 1\u20130, 3\u20130, 5\u20130, it's the same for me. Other coaches say, 'No, no, no.' I say, 'Yes, I am wrong.' I opened the midfield because this is my style.\" Scolari's honesty might be applauded in most walks of life but Premier League managers inhabit a parallel universe, one in which any admission or U-turn can be interpreted as a sign of weakness. The decision to revert to his own convictions over zonal marking has also laid him open to such conclusions. It is difficult to imagine Sir Alex Ferguson, for example, chopping and changing in this fundamental area. It will be fascinating to see if his players are inspired or otherwise. Scolari's message today seemed to be that from now on he would do it his way and, having given all of his main players runs in the team and the chance to impress, he has got a clear idea of his best XI. He will play it tomorrow night on what promises to be a raucous occasion at Roots Hall and again against Stoke City at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. The outlook looks bleak for Didier Drogba, who has started the last four games but largely failed to impress. Scolari prefers a lone striker and Nicolas Anelka's claims are insistent. \"I have looked at many games with Anelka and I have looked at the last four or five games with Didier,\" said Scolari. \"I have my opinion and I will put my opinion on the pitch every game. If I have given the players only one chance, then maybe some of them will complain but when I have given four or five chances, then there is no room for questions.\" Scolari veered from the bullish to the slightly vulnerable, from agitation to an element of helplessness. He aggressively challenged the agents in the game, some of whom he feels have been stirring behind the scenes, to declare their intentions with the transfer window now open. \"If one player does not want to stay at Chelsea, now is the time, come now, make an offer,\" he exclaimed, before his thoughts turned to the players at his disposal. \"This is a team that many coaches built before [me], I arrive with [Jose] Bosingwa and Deco,\" he said. \"It's a team that was built before and is in good condition until now.\" Scolari has his work cut out to effect an upturn in fortunes. Scott Minto on Chelsea's dead-ball blues \"There's no doubt about it, the first goal at Old Trafford was the defining moment of the match and I was surprised that Chelsea had no one on the back post, especially after Clint Dempsey's first goal for Fulham at Craven Cottage. Jamie Carragher on Sky referred to zonal marking, which is a way of not blaming anyone. I'm not a big fan of zonal marking as it allows players to drift between defenders. \"I thought Nemanja Vidic was very clever for the third goal, blocking off Franco di Santo, who shouldn't have been marking the goalscorer, Dimitar Berbatov. Di Santo's a big lad, but he is young and inexperienced. I don't know whether it is Luiz Felipe Scolari or Peter Cech who decides on the marking for set-pieces, I'm led to believe it is Cech. \"With the match against Stoke this weekend Chelsea are going to have to be work on set-pieces all week \u2014 if Rory Delap is fit then the trajectory and pace of his long throws is going to be a threat. Scolari must know that his side will be bombarded, whether from throws, free-kicks or corners. Southend too will try their luck with set-pieces. \"The amount of goals Chelsea are conceding from set-pieces is surprising \u2014 Didier Drogba and Michael Ballack are two of the best defenders of set-pieces in the league, up there with John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho. Counting the disallowed goal, which was excellent play, they conceded three from set-pieces on Sunday, but they were quality deliveries. The Chelsea players are world class and I expect them to bounce back. It won't be easy against Southend, but I do fully expect them to win it.\" Scott Minto played left-back for Chelsea between 1994 and 1997."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
