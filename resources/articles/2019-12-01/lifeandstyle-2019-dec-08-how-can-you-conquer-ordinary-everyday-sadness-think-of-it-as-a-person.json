Think of it as a person", "bodyText": "In the Pixar film Inside Out, the emotions of an 11-year-old girl are personified as perky Joy, petulant Disgust and hulking Anger. Sadness \u2013 voiced by The American Office\u2019s Phyllis Smith \u2013 is, predictably, a downer with a deep side-parting and a chunky knit. Amy Poehler\u2019s Joy can hardly stand to be around her, like a colleague you would time your trips to the tea point to avoid. But the takeaway of the 2015 film \u2013 said by Variety to \u201cfor ever change the way people think about the way people think\u201d \u2013 was that both emotions were necessary, and Sadness was as valid a part of life as Joy. Now there is a case for not only accepting Sadness, as in Inside Out \u2013 but embodying her, too. Researchers from Hong Kong and Texas recently found that individuals asked to think of their sadness as a person reported feeling less sad afterwards, a result they attributed to the increased distance perceived between the self and the emotion. Study participants were asked to imagine Sadness\u2019s personality, appearance, conversational style and how they might interact with them. In doing so, the idea was they would make it separate and less relevant to them. \u201cThe underlying mechanics of it is detachment \u2013 when they think about sadness as a person, it\u2019s like they are endowing independence to the emotion,\u201d says Li Yang, a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin and corresponding author of the paper, published in September in the Journal of Consumer Psychology. \u201cThey feel detached from it, and that\u2019s why they would feel less sad afterwards.\u201d Sadness is well established by research as leading people to focus on short-term and often indulgent rewards. By picturing their sadness with human traits and characteristics, study participants ameliorated its effect and were then more likely to display self-control. Such anthropomorphic thinking was even shown to be an effective advance strategy, preparing consumers to choose a healthier (or more practical) option. \u201cWe think about it as a new way to regulate your emotions,\u201d says Yang. There are obvious limitations to the study, she says \u2013 researchers investigated the short-term effects of anthropomorphic thinking on only sadness and its opposite emotion. Picturing happiness as a person also diluted its effect, suggesting the strategy could backfire. It is also not known whether it would be as effective in detaching from other negative emotions, such as guilt or embarrassment, which are more inherently self-involved, says Yang. Depression, too, is far more complex than just sadness. But many of us could benefit from better harnessing the power of the mind over emotions, as established time and again by research into emotional regulation. Even a simple change in language can help change your perspective. Dr Ozlem Ayduk, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, says 20 years of research has shown self-distancing to be important in minimising distress caused by negative memories or experiences. In early studies asking participants to assume the position of an observer, replaying \u201cthe scene in their mind\u2019s eye, as if they were a fly on the wall\u201d, was consistently linked to a lower emotional response \u2013 be that sadness, anxiety, anger or even anticipated instances of them in the future. Ayduk\u2019s studies have shown such distancing to be effective whether imposed in study conditions or reached for spontaneously, and over a variety of different stress-inducing situations \u2013 from being called on to speak in public, to even thinking about the Ebola crisis. Moreover, the benefits seem to persist over time. It works by creating an opportunity to process a difficult event, and reframe its meaning on the basis of its facts alone. \u201cThe problem, when we are in our own egocentric mode, is that we are feeling anxious, angry or sad and we can\u2019t see it any other way, partly because of those emotions,\u201d says Ayduk. \u201cAs you turn down the emotions, different perspectives become available \u2013 and as different perspectives become available, the emotions turn down.\u201d More recently, in looking for more techniques for emotional regulation, Ayduk and other researchers have turned their attention to internal monologue. In attempting to process and move on from difficult emotions or experiences, it is accepted that analysing them yourself can be helpful. But Ayduk says this can easily become unconstructive if it tips into rumination, a risk factor for depression and anxiety, that potentially increases their impact. In a study published in the journal Nature in 2017, Ayduk and her collaborators found that switching your self-talk from first person to third person may be helpful in managing emotions during stressful times. The example they gave was a man upset about being dumped: he was found to be less emotionally reactive when he reflected on his feelings in the third person (\u201cWhy is John upset?\u201d) than when he addressed himself directly (\u201cWhy am I upset?\u201d) Robust effects were recorded in study participants responding to distressing imagery and personal challenges. \u201cWe use names and third- and second-person pronouns to refer exclusively to other people, so, by making that switch in language as we reflect about ourselves, we could trick our minds to think about ourselves as if we are other people,\u201d says Ayduk. Talking about yourself to yourself as you would a friend is a common recommendation of therapists to highlight how hard we can be on ourselves, often without even realising it. But the science of self-distancing is more involved than our simply being kinder about others than we are about ourselves, says Ayduk. \u201cMost of us have experienced this. We seem to reason perfectly well about other people\u2019s problems; it\u2019s our own that we can\u2019t reason through, and the reason for that is ourselves and our egos are in the middle of the situation \u2013 we feel threatened, we have biases, we have defensive reactions.\u201d A simple switch in pronouns manipulates the mind into creating psychological distance, allowing us to bypass some of those counterproductive mechanisms and to reason more objectively and perhaps come to terms with our emotions. The strength of the strategy lies in its relative simplicity, says Ayduk, especially compared with visualising yourself from a distance: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to do because it\u2019s something we\u2019re so used to doing. Yes, you can pretend to be a fly on the wall, but it\u2019s easier to have a parallel, internal monologue that you can modify.\u201d Ayduk\u2019s collaborator Dr Jason Moser, an associate professor of psychology at Michigan State University and lead author on the 2017 study, notes that regulating your emotions is often thought of as a feat of self-control, as mindfulness and positive thinking take time and discipline to master. But using the third person has been shown to take no more toll on the brain\u2019s activity than using the first person, suggesting it could be a \u201crelatively effortless\u201d and effective means of managing your emotional response on the spot. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that it can help people manage their social anxiety or performance anxiety before giving a speech, before interacting with people they\u2019ve never met before,\u201d says Moser. As a nervous flyer, Moser reaches for third-person self-talk himself: \u201cI just start talking to myself: \u2018Jason really hates turbulence. Why is Jason so worried about turbulence? Jason is worried the plane is going to crash.\u2019 Then, naturally, I start giving myself advice as I would another person on the plane struggling with flight anxiety, such as: \u2018Air travel is the safest form of travel; everything\u2019s going to be fine.\u2019\u201d Whether self-talk has a role in treating clinical depression, anxiety and other mental health issues is \u201cthe million-dollar question\u201d, says Moser. It is currently being researched. As a clinical therapist by training, he is aware of the challenges \u2013 but the preliminary data as well as the literature already amassed suggests there is huge potential. \u201cThe data all seems to point to the same bottom line: this is something you can give to people that they can use for processing memories from the past, things in the moment, as well as anticipating stressful situations in the future. That basically covers the gamut of things people are struggling with.\u201d Elle intends to try it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
