But only a handful are interested in selling these new, low-cost pensions to individuals. Of these, most have websites but few let you purchase a stakeholder pension online. However, the number of fully functional websites is expected to increase rapidly over the coming months. This will be driven by the need for providers to keep transaction costs to a minimum so they can make some money. Stakeholder costs must not exceed 1% a year - a far cry from the fat profits to be made in personal pensions. This 1% cap on costs precludes commission to independent financial advisers - many of whom are refusing to sell stakeholder pensions - so the internet will be vital. But there are pitfalls to buying online - in particular the issue of redress if things go wrong. If you buy online from a pensions company you are participating in a \"direct offer\" sale. This only requires the provider to supply you with the information to make an informed decision - not advice. If you can prove that what you were told was deficient you might have a comeback against the provider, but if not, you're on your own. If you buy via an independent financial adviser's website, the sale will be regarded as an \"execution-only\" purchase. This means that you have agreed to buy without advice and that you won't be able to complain to the regulator afterwards. Redress will normally only be available if you pay an IFA a separate fee for individual advice. The managing director of the stakeholder.co.uk website, Chris Dixon, says: \"By paying a few hundred pounds for advice, you are in effect buying an insurance policy against things going wrong in the future.\" To reduce the possibility of mis-buying stakeholders, the Financial Services Authority has produced a series of flowcharts, called decision trees, which help individuals work out whether a stakeholder purchase is appropriate to their financial circumstances. These can be found on the net at fsa.gov.uk. It has also produced a 24-page fact sheet which online purchasers must read before a purchase can take place. Stakeholder pensions are not appropriate for all. If you already have a personal pension, you need to consider the cost of diverting existing pension contributions. By October 8 2001, all employers with five or more staff will be required to offer access to a stakeholder scheme to employees, so if you don't have internet access at home, you may be able to apply for one online at your workplace. \"A good stakeholder website should be easy to navigate and quick to load - consumers don't want flashy graphics,\" says David Burns, director of the management consultants NMG Financial Services. \"Clear explanatory information is essential, as is the facility to return to the website to monitor their investments after they've bought.\" The Co-operative Insurance Society (CIS) and Scottish Widows websites score well on ease of use and clarity of information. Telephone support and help buttons are also a welcome feature. Advance warning of details (such as national insurance number and bank details) required to buy online is helpful, particularly if the information can't be saved. All the websites require payment by direct debit, although a few allow one-off credit card contributions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
