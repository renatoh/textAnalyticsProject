An annual survey of graduate recruiters showed an 8% drop in vacancies on a year ago as companies also cited concerns about a new apprenticeship levy to be paid by all big employers from next April. The fall in 2016 is a marked contrast with last year when the number of graduate jobs rose by 13% year-on-year. The Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR) said that university leavers should not despair at the latest drop in new jobs, however. \u201cThe majority of graduate employers are still hiring in significant numbers,\u201d said AGR\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Isherwood. He cautioned against overplaying the drop in vacancies. \u201cWhat we found in the financial crisis was that employers were struggling to get the message out that they were still recruiting and that it wasn\u2019t armageddon out there.\u201d The AGR survey found there were 19,732 positions to fill for 2016 compared with 21,427 last year. Vacancies in construction, retail and engineering had fallen the most. IT and telecoms was the only sector in which vacancies were up on last year. The drop follows four years of sustained growth in the graduate recruitment market and contrasts with employer forecasts at the start of this year for growth of 2% in vacancies this year. For some employers the decline in graduate vacancies had been mitigated by an increase in apprenticeships, although not enough to make up for the shortfall, according to AGR. Among graduate employers, the number of apprenticeships has risen by 13% this year. Overall the number of vacancies for graduate jobs and apprenticeships decreased 3% year-on-year. Asked what their three biggest worries were for the next recruitment season, employers ranked Brexit as top, followed by competition for getting people with the right skills and then the impact of the apprenticeship levy, which is being introduced next April. More than one in 10 employers said they were repackaging some graduate roles as higher-level apprenticeships because of the levy. Isherwood said that with employers worried about skills shortages they would be wary of significantly reducing graduate recruitment. \u201cEmployers have learned that when they cut off graduate recruitment for the needs of short-term budget reduction, they pay the price three years down the line,\u201d he said. The report is based on responses from 208 companies offering school leaver and graduates jobs. The year-on-year figures on graduate jobs are based on 154 employers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
