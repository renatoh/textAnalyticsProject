He has applied the same fannish, wide-eyed approach to this non-fiction feature about the \"Elite 24\" basketball tournament for top US high school stars in New York. Yauch's movie has a tone of unvarying, uncritical celebration: this tournament is supposedly all about getting away from sponsorship hype, yet these teen stars have clearly signed up, or are about to, for truckloads of corporate dollars, and if their paymasters didn't want them to do this tournament, the kids would avoid it. This is just a dull promotional video."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
