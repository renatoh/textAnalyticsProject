The 16 participating amateur ensembles were colour-coded - smart blacks and reds for Maspindzeli, the wonderfully gritty Georgian Choir, national dress for the Armenians and Maoris and smart uniforms for the school choirs. In this context, Orlando Gough and Richard Chew's professional choir The Shout were just another ensemble, MCs whose own repertoire provided links while new sets rumbled into position. The show opened with their soloists (including Carol Grimes and Wills Morgan) positioned high in the building singing through megaphones. Scattered through the Roundhouse, the 500 voices joined in, and two large screens showed a continuous sequence of mug shots - one of each participating singer - that continued throughout. Showcases followed for each group: a liturgical piece from the Armenian Church Choir, Walton's Set Me as a Seal Upon Thine Heart by the New Elmwood Singers. The terrific Congolese Christian Choir raised the temperature by singing Gough and Chew's Because I Sing (the \"refrain\") and Mpeve Ya Nlongo with joyous intensity. The programme asked us to \"refrain from applauding until the end\", but that convention was soon cheerfully abandoned. With so many different choirs singing their favourite pieces, this was more like a choir festival than a piece of theatre, and by the time we reached the alternating performances by the London Gay Men's Chorus (Rogers &amp; Hammerstein's Keep It Gay) and the Lea Valley WI Singers (Kern &amp; Harbach's Smoke Gets in Your Eyes) the audience responded with cheers and wolf whistles. Yet there was no sense of competitiveness - the choirs were of such different shapes, sounds and sizes that each song took you into a different musical world, from the delicate modernism of P Lane's Gardener's Nonsense Song (by the glamorous South Hampstead High School Choirs) to the low frequencies of bass soloist David Hilton with the London Jewish Male Voice Choir. For the grand finale, the singers converged choir by choir upon the central stage area. Each choir sang a different song - Twinkle Twinkle for The Shout, Maybe It's Because I'm a Londoner for Maspindzeli - until the auditorium throbbed with a vast melodious noise. Finally assembled in a multicoloured throng they sang Gough and Chew's refrain, bringing the evening to a dramatic close with the solo voice of The Shout's Manickam Yogeswarah. \u0095 Because I Sing is the subject of a documentary broadcast on Channel 4 on May 27."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
