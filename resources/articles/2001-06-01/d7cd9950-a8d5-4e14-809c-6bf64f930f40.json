Gibbs, a member of the victorious 1997 Lions' Tour of South Africa, has been given the nod over Scotland's Gregor Townsend. Henry explained his choice, saying: \"We decided to go for a specialist inside centre.\" Catt's injury means he now follows Simon Taylor and Phil Greening as the Lions third major injury casualty. The players' player of the year, will leave the tour party after Saturday's game against New South Wales Waratahs. Gibbs. the Swansea and Wales centre - considered unlucky to miss out in the initial Tour selection - brings with him valuable experience and a reputation for rising to the big occasion. He can be remembered for flattening South Africa's 20-stone prop Os du Randt during the Lions 1997 tour to South Africa and generally made life miserable for the Springboks. Four years previously he gained test selection in New Zealand and has won more than 50 caps for Wales. Gibbs will join up with the Lions in Manly tomorrow evening, local time, ahead of Saturday's match against NSW Waratahs at the Sydney Football Stadium. Meanwhile Dan Luger has now added his name to the injury list following an accident in training. England Wing Luger was involved in an accidental collision with flanker Neil Back and has been ruled out for Saturday. Jason Robinson will replace Luger, creating space on the substitutes' bench for Ben Cohen. If the injury to Luger was to prove serious it would be a massive set-back for Henry as the winger was rated as a certainty to start the first Test in Brisbane a week on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
