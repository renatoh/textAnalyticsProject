The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said a rise in disposable incomes, business investment and a construction sector boosted by a buoyant housing market would all accelerate the economic recovery in 2014. It pointed out that the improving economic data would benefit the government \u2013 especially the Conservatives \u2013 in the run-up to next year's general election: \"There is probably scope for modest tax cuts of about \u00a37bn gross \u2026 in the budget to be held next March.\" It predicted that GDP growth, inflation at less than 2% when the country goes to the polls, low interest rates, continuing falls in unemployment and rising house prices could create a feelgood factor. \"The election will be competed for on the back of relatively strong economic growth, with GDP up at least 5% in the two years preceding the election. Perhaps more surprisingly, this would give a cumulative GDP growth of over 9% for the entire parliament \u2013 which most would judge to be a reasonable result in an age of austerity,\" it said. The CEBR's predicted growth of 3.1% this year would be the strongest rate of annual growth since 2007, when GDP increased by 3.4%, before the financial crisis triggered a 0.8% fall in national output in 2008. This latest forecast, upgraded from an earlier prediction of 2.8%, is more optimistic than that of the Treasury's official and independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which said last month it expected growth of 2.7% in 2014. The economy grew by 1.7% in 2013. \"Following concerns about the unbalanced nature of the economic recovery \u2013 consumer spending accounted for over 80% of the growth seen last year \u2013 growth should become more evenly spread as business investment grows strongly, and the construction sector is supported by a robust pickup in house building, especially in London,\" the CEBR said. It believes that consumer spending will account for 46% of growth this year, and expects business investment to grow strongly, by 10.1% in real terms. It predicted a much rosier outlook for households this year, with real disposable incomes expected to grow by 1.5% following a fall of 0.6% in 2013. Annual inflation, currently at 1.6%, is expected to remain below the Bank of England's 2% target for the rest of the year, further easing the burden on consumers. Declining unemployment is also likely to support household finances. But the pace of growth is expected to slow to 2.2% in 2015 and 2% in 2016, as some of the factors driving current growth \u2013 such as consumers dipping into their savings to fund purchases \u2013 wear off. The burden of austerity will be felt beyond the election in 2015, with deep government spending cuts to follow, weighing on growth. \"Despite much rhetoric about austerity and 'savage' spending cuts, the incumbent government has made little progress in bringing down the total amount of government spending,\" the CEBR said. \"Real government spending in 2014 is expected to stand 1.8% higher than in 2010. \"Over the course of the next parliament, 2015-2020, we expect real government spending to decline by 2.1% as spending cuts kick in.\" It said the \"parlous state of the UK's trade position\" could also become a significant issue for the economy. The CEBR is forecasting a record \u00a379bn current account deficit this year. Britain's economic recovery has become more established in recent months, with growth in the first quarter expected to match or beat the 0.7% quarterly increase in GDP achieved in the fourth quarter of 2013. Despite the improved outlook, the Bank of England has made it clear it is no rush to increase interest rates, against a backdrop of below-target inflation and weak wage growth and productivity. Rates have been on hold at an all-time low of 0.5% since March 2009."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
