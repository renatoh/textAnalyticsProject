Since a pending court appearance caused him to leave the England job after Euro 96, Venables, if you believe his coterie of protective friends, has been constantly side-stepping managerial job offers. So one has to wonder about his motives in finally abandoning a television career in which he never seemed comfortable and whether he has the credentials to drive on Leeds United. One has to applaud his decision, at the age of 59, to exchange his trademark suit for a tracksuit and a seat in the dugout. He will soon find that he will not be able to survive his new role for long on a cheeky grin and stream of platitudes. His appointment is an enormous gamble for him and for Leeds' chairman Peter Ridsdale. During his period as managerial sidekick to Bryan Robson at Middlesbrough in 2000-2001, Venables accomplished his mission to keep the club in the Premiership, which was all he was required to do. That was a notable achievement but his tactical methods seemed to have been pulled out of mothballs. His policy of packing midfield and defence to deny the opposition space and often relying on one striker to steal a goal could have come from an old Arsenal coaching manual, and smacked of a man who had spent too long away from the upper levels of football management. Besides, organising a struggling side into a more solid, boring, hard-to-beat unit is a lot different from the task of piloting a high-profile club like Leeds into the Champions League. As his friend George Graham, David O'Leary's predecessor at Leeds, says: \"David has been sacked after finishing fifth in the Premiership. So Terry will have to do better than that. \"I thought he might have been satisfied with his television work but he has obviously missed being on the training field, where he is in his element,\" Graham said. \"Leeds needed someone with his big personality and he is taking over a wonderful squad.\" The arrival of a players' man like Venables will surely mean most of the dressing-room pegs will still carry the same clothes at the start of the season, although his first job will be to cash in \u00a315m worth of footballing talent. As a man who began his Barcelona career by selling Diego Maradona and bringing in Steve Archibald, who played a leading role in their league success and run to the European Cup final, that should not be a problem. The question is whether, at his advanced age and so long on the fringes of the game, Venables is on the same wavelength as the modern Premiership player. Greying temples are not a problem per se, or Bobby Robson would not still be enjoying such success at Newcastle. But he has lived and breathed football all his life, whereas Venables has rarely given his full attention to the game. Apart from his TV work, he has been involved in nightclubs and myriad business schemes, and recently launched a World Cup record in direct competition to Ant and Dec. Venables seems psychologically incapable of devoting himself to one thing; this is perplexing where football is concerned since it is the one thing he has always been cut out to do. Although Leeds' official supporters' club have backed Venables, he is not everyone's favourite. Fan Steve Speroni says: \"He is a poor choice. He had moderate success with England and Australia, who didn't qualify for the World Cup when he was in charge. And has everyone forgotten how poor he was recently at Palace and Portsmouth?\" The appointment certainly smacks of desperation, particularly for a club looking for a firm hand on the disciplinary tiller after a series of high-profile incidents among their players. Venables, remember, was in charge of England during the infamous dentist's chair incident in the Far East and when a plane was damaged on the way home, just weeks before Euro 96. Despite the impression given by Venables' cronies that England won Euro 96, his team actually triumphed in only two games out of five, one of them against a clearly disinterested Dutch side. Venables, in what is doubtless his favourite karaoke song, wants to end his football career with a rendition of My Way. He is brave to try but one suspects that, like the majority of his forays into management and most of his business ventures, it will end in acrimony, divorce and a messy legal dispute.
