Joe Stewart, a researcher with Atlanta-based SecureWorks, analysed the code the Hydraq Trojan also known as Operation Aurora. On the company's blog, Stewart doesn't mince words about what he referred to as \"espionage-by-malware\" originating from China: With the recently disclosed hacking incident inside Google and other major companies, much of the world has begun to wake up to what the infosec community has known for some time \u2013 there is a persistent campaign of \"espionage-by-malware\" emanating from the People's Republic of China (PRC). Corporate and state secrets both have been shanghaied over a period of five or more years, and the activity becomes bolder over time with little public acknowledgement or response from the U.S. government. However, he also explains how difficult it is to definitively link the attacks to hackers in China, much less the Chinese state. He writes, \"outside of the fact that PRC IP addresses have been used as control servers in the attacks, there is no 'hard evidence' of involvement of the PRC or any agents thereof.\" The attackers could have purchased hosting on those servers or compromised them as well. It is one reason why Verisign would not support the statement of its subsidiary, iDefense, linking the attacks to the Chinese state or its proxies. It could be a false-flag attack designed to draw suspicion to China. Stewart looked for clues in the code. He discovered a CRC (cyclic redundancy check) algorithm that \"seems to be virtually unknown outside of China\". As he explains in the post: \"CRCs are used to check for errors that might have been introduced into stored or transferred data\". The CRC code is from China, released in a paper there on optimising such codes for microcontrollers. He has never seen this type of CRC code before, and when he did a Google search on key parts of the algorithm, it returned only Chinese results. UPDATE: Other analysts say that the code is not limited to China and is quite common in microcontrollers. Commenters on this blog by a University of Oregon professor say the code has been used on a calculator from Texas Instruments and firmware for MP3 players. It weakens Stewart's case. Google stopped short of implicating the Chinese government, even when pressed, and this is but another piece of circumstantial evidence of the origin of the attack. However, pulling together this evidence, Stewart concludes: considering the scope, choice of targets and the overwhelming boldness of the attacks (in light of the harsh penalties we have seen handed out in communist China for other computer intrusion offenses), this creates speculation around whether the attacks could be state-sponsored. This still is not definitive proof, and other explanations exist, but Stewart told the New York Times, \"Occam's Razor suggests that the simplest explanation is probably the best one.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
