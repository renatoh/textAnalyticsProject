He halts and begins to retreat, convinced he has opened the wrong door: 'The tiny figure with the thin white hair under the sheets couldn't be my mother. But it was, she was.' By the time he leaves her hours later, she is 'indisputably my mum again. But I felt shocked at having failed to recognise her - my error seemed symptomatic. It was as though I didn't really know her. As though she'd always been someone else.' Who she was and why she tried all her life to hide her true identity is what Morrison sets out to discover in this compelling and beautifully written memoir. It is not the first time he has rootled among the skeletons in the family closet. His 1993 bestseller And When Did You Last See Your Father? anatomised his love for his difficult, intrusive, overbearing father with unsparing frankness and arguably created a new genre of confessional memoir. You might have thought there was little left to say about his family but this sequel is in some ways even better than the first book. It is an older, sadder, wiser work in which Morrison demonstrates a little less self-absorption, a touch more compassion. The book grew from a cache of wartime letters between his parents that he purloined from the family home in Yorkshire before his mother died. He admits it was 'sneaky' to take them ('a shit's trick') but he was afraid she might remember and destroy them. As he reads them in his London study he feels 'excited, guilty, lucky, furtive, amazed' to discover how little he knew about his mother's Irish background. He had no idea, for instance, that her real name was Agnes (he knew her as Kim), that she was the nineteenth of 20 children or that her family, always characterised by the Morrisons as 'bog-trotting peasants', were prosperous wool merchants. And he knew nothing of the strength and depth of her Catholicism - the rock on which her marriage almost foundered. On one level, the letters tell the story of an often stormy love affair between two doctors separated by war. Agnes was exhaustingly busy in half a dozen different British inner-city hospitals, delivering babies, saving lives, learning surgery and writing letters that break off suddenly because of medical emergency. Arthur, his father, was an RAF medic stationed in Iceland and then the Azores, giving lectures on VD, reading Lady Chatterley and writing to Agnes about the pretty nurses he might be tempted to go off with. The progress of their on-off airmail courtship makes fascinating reading, not least to Morrison whose future literally depends on it. Equally absorbing is the way the letters reveal how Agnes slowly, inexorably sheds her former identity. Starting with her name change to Kim, suggested by the controlling Arthur, and climaxing with her departure from the Catholic Church - Arthur refused to marry her if she stayed - she expunges virtually all traces of the life she led and the person she was before she met him. But why? It is a question that Morrison never quite manages to answer. Did 1950s northern English prejudice make her ashamed of being Irish? Maybe. Had too much Catholic worship bred in her an unthinking obedience to her husband? Possibly. Agnes-Kim was so good at hiding her real feelings that her son finds it impossible to know for sure. Arthur tried to make her give up her work as a doctor but it was the one part of herself that she clung to, continuing to work as a GP and hospital obstetrician throughout her married life, which was remarkable at the time. But she did it so discreetly and self-effacingly that her children barely noticed. Her letters show that she could be assertive at work, but at home she was 'so bloody supine' [I feel] driven half round the bend by her passivity', her son explodes at one point. She tolerated with barely a murmur her husband's 10-year affair with a mistress, the bouncy 'aunty' Beaty, sitting tight until it fizzled out. Morrison thinks her repressed hurt and anger came out in the migraines and depression that plagued her most of her life. Would she have wanted her son poking about in her drawers and not only reading but publishing her love letters? One suspects not, especially since, on the publication of And When Did You Last See Your Father?, she told Morrison's sister, Gill, 'I could top myself because of that bloody book'. Yet if she did not want the letters to be seen why did she not throw them away? And when he found them, how was a writer like Morrison supposed to resist? The fact that he writes so well, and with such love, makes it easier to forgive Morrison for what could be seen as the ultimate betrayal of his mother's 'quietism'. And you sense that the woman who used make-up to conceal rather than to beautify has had the last laugh in the end anyway. For she remains an enigma. For all the expertise that he applies to this remarkable, unsentimental, highly readable reconstruction of her extraordinary ordinary life, Agnes-Kim has succeeded in eluding her son. Morrison admits as much: 'To be invisible was her objective, and she succeeded with a vengeance. It's as if she has gone without a trace.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
