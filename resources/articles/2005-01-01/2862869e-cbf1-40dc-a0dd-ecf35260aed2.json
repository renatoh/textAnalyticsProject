'We are due to go to a Sheraton hotel in Krabi after spending some time in Bangkok. It was hit but we don't know how badly. The pool area was damaged and there may have been some structural harm but it's hoping to reopen soon. 'Thomson isn't letting tourists back yet but I'm determined to go. I've wanted to go to Thailand my whole life and they rely on tourism. The tsunami has changed how I feel about going. I'm not promoting the fact or acting excited in front of friends.' The Observer's Nicole Mowbray, 26, from London, is due to travel to Thailand to stay at a spa in Chiva-Som on the Gulf of Thailand in two weeks. 'At first I didn't know whether to go or not. I felt bad ringing up the hotel to see if I could still do my break, and when I bought a guide book to Thailand the other day I felt like I was a bit sick, but now I'm determined to go. Staying away won't help, sitting on a beach may not help directly either, but the money you spend will.' Why we are cancelling Kevin McDougall, 29, and his fianc\u00e9e Charlotte Cumming, 28, both from Brighton, had planned to visit Bangkok and then either Phuket, Koh Phi Phi or Koh Samui for their honeymoon in May. 'We were going to book just after Christmas but after what happened we decided we didn't want to go anymore, even to Koh Samui which wasn't hit, just because of the feeling and the atmosphere there. We're gutted, but we just didn't want to spend our honeymoon surrounded by what has happened. 'Maybe if it wasn't our honeymoon we would still be going, but my fianc\u00e9e is also quite concerned about the spread of disease. Instead we're going to do a city break in New York and then go to Tobago or Antigua.' Tim Hughes, 35, a marine surveyor from the south west, was due to honeymoon in the Maldives on 31 January with Kate Macgill, 37, and their three children. 'If we had just planned a normal holiday there, or it was three months down the road, we would still have gone, but because it is our honeymoon we didn't want all the feelings associated with what's happened. 'I wasn't worried about it happening again, but that the local people will still be reeling from the massive shock and it wouldn't be fair to expect them to party with us. 'I've just come back from Grenada where I assessed hurricane damage to boats, so I knew what to expect. 'We are gutted we're not going. We're heading to the Caribbean instead. It is not the same but we'd like to go back to Asia for a holiday in the future.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
