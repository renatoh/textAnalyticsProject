In her first comments since protests started in the semi-autonomous city last week, the British prime minister said she was deeply concerned and the UK had a special responsibility to speak out in favour of freedoms in the former British colony. \u201cWe are concerned about [the] potential effects of these proposals particularly obviously given the large number of British citizens there are in Hong Kong,\u201d May told parliament. \u201cBut it is vital that those extradition arrangements in Hong Kong are in line with the rights and freedoms that were set down in the Sino-British joint declaration.\u201d The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, responded to growing calls to intervene by urging China to preserve a high level of autonomy in Hong Kong and engage in meaningful dialogue. With the UK possessing scant legal leverage over Hong Kong\u2019s future, Hunt opted instead to urge China to recognise it was in its own interests to show restraint, in order to preserve its international reputation. \u201cThe ongoing protests in Hong Kong are a clear sign of significant public concern about the proposed changes to extradition laws. I call on all sides to remain calm and peaceful,\u201d he said in a statement. Hunt also urged the Hong Kong authorities \u201cto listen to the concerns of its people and its friends in the international community, and to pause and reflect on these controversial measures. It is essential that the authorities engage in meaningful dialogue and take steps to preserve Hong Kong\u2019s rights and freedoms and high degree of autonomy, which underpin its international reputation.\u201d He continued: \u201cUpholding the principle of \u2018one country, two systems\u2019, as set out in the legally binding Sino-British joint declaration, is vital to Hong Kong\u2019s future success.\u201d Hunt had already issued a joint statement with the Canadian government urging China to give the Hong Kong legislative council time to come up with alternative extradition proposals that maintained business confidence. There are fears the legislation could be pushed through within a week. Britain\u2019s minister for Asia, Mark Field, told MPs on Monday that recent concessions on the proposed law fell short of protecting the city\u2019s autonomy and judicial independence. \u201cThere are widespread concerns that fear of extradition to China might have a chilling effect on Hong Kong\u2019s rights and freedoms and result in increased self-censorship \u2026 Hong Kong must enjoy the full measure of its high degree of autonomy and rule of law as set out in the joint declaration and enshrined in the basic law,\u201d he said. \u201cMany fear above all that Hong Kong nationals and residents risk being pulled into China\u2019s legal system, which can involve lengthy pre-trial detentions, televised confessions and an absence of many of the judicial safeguards that we see in Hong Kong and in the UK.\u201d Hinting that the UK could declare a breach in the joint declaration, he said the extradition bill came close to representing a breach, not just of the spirit but of the text. The last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, has said the extradition bill\u2019s provisions are \u201ca terrible blow \u2026 against the rule of law, against Hong Kong\u2019s stability and security, against Hong Kong\u2019s position as a great international trading hub\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
