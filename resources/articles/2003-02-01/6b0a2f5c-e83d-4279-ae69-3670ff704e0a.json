Rash (noun) - a series of unpleasant and unexpected occurrences. Jockrash (noun) - a series of unpleasant and unexpected occurrences at Murrayfield, typified by natives acting without due thought or consideration for fellow Celts. In Ireland the above condition has reached epidemic levels among the international rugby fraternity. The symptoms comprise shortage of breath, a heavy feeling in the legs and general malaise. Victims complain of being clear-headed, but unable to make any useful connection between brain and limbs. 'It's like an out-of-body experience gone wrong,' said one tearful patient, who wished not to be named. 'I don't even want to think about it.' Then he broke down. The law of probabilities tells us that - all things being roughly equal - the longer a run of results continues the greater the chances are of it coming to an end. Over the years you'd say that there's never been much between Ireland and Scotland. In which case every explosion of jockrash brings the cure that bit closer. By now Irish rugby supporters are clinging to this like drowning men hanging on to a raft. They have had enough. They want salvation. They want freedom from the yoke that Murrayfield has become. Even before the introduction of the dreaded Sunday games, for a rump of Irish supporters the trip to Edinburgh had lost its appeal. We welcomed the Italians into the Championship for all sorts of reasons. Four nights ago in the team room at Ireland's hotel the players were presented with the nuts and bolts of it. There, on the screen at the top of the room, was the evidence of failure: nine visits and nine defeats. From the high scoring and highly entertaining games of 1989 (37-21) and 1991 (28-25) to the mortifying whelpings of 1997 (38-10) and 2001 (32-10). It was all there in black and white. There was no point in pretending that this was just another game. It has enough baggage to fill a skip. 'It was all there and we talked about every aspect of it, from the way we travel to what we do when we arrive and the attitude we bring to the game,' Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan said. So they started by ensuring that the trip over went smoothly. They left the hotel on the outskirts of Dublin at 9.15am on Thursday, and walked in the door of their base in the heart of Edinburgh at 12.45pm. No messing, no hanging around. The players were given plenty of time over the last couple of days to look around town and take in the atmosphere. There would be no hiding in the hills and slipping in on the morning of the game. Eleven of this team featured here two seasons ago, so they have played their own part in the awful record. They have to face up to that, and if it was presented to them every time they walked down the street then so be it. You reap what you sow. 'The two things we've been done on here, as long as I can remember, is that mentally we weren't at the races, and physically they bullied us,' O'Sullivan said. 'And obviously the two are connected. If we front up mentally and physically then it becomes a game of rugby and we'll see how it goes. But they've beaten us hands down in those areas over the years and we have to change that.' So having identified the problem you wonder if they have the tools to fix it. This is where Irish teams usually come apart. A glance down the Scotland team sheet is followed by the conclusion that individually they ain't world beaters. And things slide from there. Traditionally this starts by looking at the Scottish forward pack and concluding that they can't scrummage. Even this time, individually, the Irish forwards would probably fancy themselves as superior. But they will have watched the video of Scotland dismantling the Springboks in the autumn, and the scrum rang an alarm bell across the water. More than ever the scrum will have a massive impact on today's game. If you take out your Living with Lions video from the 1997 trip you can see what Jim Telfer has been up to on those Monday sessions, leading up to today, when he gathers the Scotland forwards: scrumming off centre; twisting, pulling, dragging. And when there has to be direct engagement it is made with the force of every fibre in your body. This is what awaits Ireland. The contest is given added interest by last week's missive from those men of great clarity and vision, the International Rugby Board lawmakers. It seems they want referees to apply some of the laws that have been with us since time began. Specifically they are talking about feeding the ball in straight to the scrum, a practice frowned upon some time back by architects of the Super 12. So, unless Bryan Redpath and Peter Stringer can immediately change their work practices, referee Andrew Cole will be forced to award a stream of free-kicks. In which case the game will be played at something in excess of 100 miles an hour. And that brings us to the second hobby horse on which the IRB are riding forth: the contest at the breakdown. From this weekend, slowing ruck ball illegally will be right up there with genocide and not buying your round. Referees are to wade in at the first sign of delay and start flashing yellow. Much will depend on how enthusiastically Mr Cole implements all of this, but if he fancies a run at the World Cup in October then brace yourselves for some pedantry. And who knows what way the game will go after that? The other great imponderable occupying Irish minds will be the form of David Humphreys. The withdrawal of Ronan O'Gara early last week punctured Irish hopes. It's not that the Ulster hero is incapable of re-inflating them. With Humphreys you get the flashes of brilliance, but when things are going badly it's the glimpses of panic that are more likely to surface. In training last week he started bossing the forwards around the place and they were happy to heed his instruction. They need him in that frame of mind today, for if he begins to show symptoms of jockrash then Ireland will be done for yet again. You've read the piece, now have your say.
