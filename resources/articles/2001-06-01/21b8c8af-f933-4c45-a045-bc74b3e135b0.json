Not because today's youth are particularly fascinated by fairy tales but because the combination of memorable tunes, a clear storyline and thoroughly sophisticated music can reach everybody. More than that, the final scene can be sung by schoolchildren, and at each of the venues for this tour a different group of local children will take part in it. To make it feasible in small halls the orchestration has been reduced by John Longstaff to seven players. And for those inclined to think that Humperdinck's score is a touch adipose and saccharine this is a marvellous solution. There is a truly invigorating acerbity and wit to Longstaff's very skilled rescoring; and no praise is too high for the soloists of the small band, led by Peter Maslin and conducted from the piano by Martin Pickard. But for all that they play the opera complete: there are no other concessions to a wider audience, and in this performance they are surely not necessary. Tim Supple directs with his main focus on telling the story well. He shows his own view of the work, but always with a light touch, aided by Nicky Gillibrand's relatively simple but expressive designs. The diction throughout is as good as you will ever hear in serious opera; David Pountney's translation always helps the singers and runs remarkably well. The cast, reduced to five by normal doubling, are all new to Opera North. Charlotte Kinder and Katija Dragojevic in the title roles are absolutely thrilling, combining an apparently effortless charm on stage with gloriously paired singing. In so far as this is an opera about a soprano and a mezzo, they steal the show and yield nothing to their famous precursors in the roles. But they are marvellously supported by Fiona MacDonald, Wyn Pencarreg and Claire Wild, all of whom catch the mood with verve and high artistic skill. This is a production that deserves full houses wherever it goes. At the Playhouse, Whitley Bay (0191-252 3505) on Friday, then tour includes Preston, Huddersfield and York."}, "isHosted": false}}}
