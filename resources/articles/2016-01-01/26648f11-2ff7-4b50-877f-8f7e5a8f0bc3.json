Nor is he above issuing an apology to journalists. He did just that at his final press conference before Sunday\u2019s Liverpool game, though it was nothing to do with losing his rag after the draw at Newcastle in midweek, when he told one of his critics he was fat. That rather unedifying spat was not mentioned again, much to the relief of all concerned, but on his way out of the press room he turned to say he was sorry if anyone had been inconvenienced by the increased security measures at the training ground. \u201cWe have to do that now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because I thought anyone might pull a revolver on me.\u201d Maybe the Manchester United manager is trying to make up the perceived charisma gap between himself and his counterpart at Anfield. Van Gaal knows J\u00fcrgen Klopp of old. When the German won his first Bundesliga title with Borussia Dortmund it more or less signalled the end for the Dutch coach at Bayern Munich, who finished third. Klopp is now considered the one with the more advanced tactical theory, or at least the effect he can have on a team is more visible and positive. Van Gaal\u2019s cautious, defence-based possession game seems dull in comparison, and so, to an extent, does the coach himself. Where Klopp is all animation and emotion on the sideline, Van Gaal is expressionless and immobile in his seat. It would be easy to regard Klopp as the coming man and Van Gaal as the retiring version, though it is not yet clear whether touchline histrionics make any difference to the way the team plays. Boring or not, United are still above Liverpool in the table, and at Newcastle they managed to score three goals. That is partly why Van Gaal was so annoyed. \u201cI was more disappointed than the fans,\u201d he said. \u201cI know they haven\u2019t seen three goals for a long time, but we lost two points. When you score three goals away from home you have to hang on for the win.\u201d Now 64, Van Gaal does not feel that leaping around on the periphery would encourage his players to concentrate any better. \u201cI know that from experience,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to be a bit like Klopp when I was younger, I\u2019m not sure it got me anywhere. You certainly cannot influence the referee, because the one from the 1995 Champions League final still reminds me of the time I did a flying kick in the air to show the assistant what I thought an opponent had done to Jari Litmanen. I still think it was a penalty but we didn\u2019t get it. \u201cYou cannot make a difference from the line. I don\u2019t think referees in England are going to be influenced by what managers do. You need to control your passion. I know a lot of fans like a manager to show it, but the effect on the game is not so important. A manager can try to influence a game by changing players or communicating with them, and sometimes I come to the line to do that, but I don\u2019t stand there for 90 minutes.\u201d If this makes Van Gaal sound like a master of self-control, someone who has seen too much in his time to become excited by mere events on the pitch, that is not quite the whole picture either. \u201cAt my age you can control your passion more, but not always,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes my passion is bigger than my control. Last weekend I saw myself on television reacting badly to something. That sometimes happens and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good, but it is hard to always stay in control. I think Klopp is the same. I will be doing my best to keep control on Sunday, and so will my players.\u201d Both managers are in favour of possession-based football, the difference is mainly that Van Gaal prefers to concentrate on keeping the ball, Klopp on winning it back quickly. Liverpool can be expected to launch quick counter-attacks at Anfield, even though they are at home, whereas United will attempt to keep their shape and deny their opponents space to run into. \u201cAt Dortmund, Klopp favoured a very aggressive pressing game, and that is what he is attempting to introduce at Liverpool now,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cAt the time German teams were not used to that and he had a lot of success. But it should not be overlooked he had a very strong squad as well. He had Robert Lewandowski, Marco Reus and Mats Hummels and they were all in great shape. He demands a lot of his players, but we all try to make them as fit as possible. As a professional you have to cope with anything asked of you.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
