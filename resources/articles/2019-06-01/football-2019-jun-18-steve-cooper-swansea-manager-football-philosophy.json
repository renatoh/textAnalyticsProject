For all his achievements Cooper has next to no experience of working with senior players. \u201cIt\u2019s the obvious question to ask about me and I wanted to make sure that, when I had my meetings with Trevor, it wasn\u2019t the elephant in the room. It could be, easily,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWhenever a manager or head coach is appointed there are always questions and the obvious one with me is that it\u2019s my first senior job. But I wouldn\u2019t put myself in this position if I wasn\u2019t ready. The first person I asked if I was ready to work at senior level was myself. \u201cThe experiences I\u2019ve had up to now have all been ones with managerial responsibilities. At the World Cup in India I had 25 members of staff reporting to me. If you don\u2019t get that right or show good leadership or self-worth, then it can quickly fail. I\u2019ve been working towards that for a long time. Twelve months or so ago I was about 96% there. Now I\u2019m 100% ready. Yes, I\u2019ve still got to go and do it but I\u2019m fully equipped to do so.\u201d Aged 39, Cooper is a bold appointment on Swansea\u2019s part and it will be fascinating to see how their decision to steer clear of the usual names on the circuit \u2013 something the Welsh club have also done in the past \u2013 works out. There is already talk outside Swansea that success or failure for Cooper may determine how easily doors open for other youth coaches. \u201cI\u2019m aware that it could be beneficial to future appointments but, if I think about that too much, then I\u2019m not thinking about today and the job in hand,\u201d Cooper said. Cooper\u2019s playing philosophy, which is heavily influenced by the time he spent working at Liverpool under Pep Segura, who is now back at Barcelona as the club\u2019s general manager, was a key factor in Swansea\u2019s decision. Over the course of three interviews Cooper convinced Birch, Leon Britton, who is the football adviser to Swansea\u2019s board of directors, and Alan Curtis, the club president, that his playing principles were totally aligned to those of the club. \u201cFootball people like myself, and fans, have admired the recent history, the journey to the Premier League, the players that have been in the teams \u2013 everyone has looked with admiration,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cSo I know what that identity stands for, and that\u2019s what I believe in too, so it\u2019s a good match, a perfect fit. I\u2019ve watched every game since Christmas and lots before it. The team is in a really good place, willing to run and be brave on the ball. I\u2019m a football coach, I want to grow the players and the identity.\u201d Although Cooper\u2019s long-term goal is to try to get Swansea back in the Premier League by the end of his three-year contract, his immediate focus is on continuing the rebuilding job that Graham Potter started before departing for Brighton last month. It is a task that he is relishing but one made all the more difficult by the fact that Swansea have five senior players \u2013 Jordan Ayew, Andr\u00e9 Ayew, Borja Bast\u00f3n, Tom Carroll and Jefferson Montero \u2013 whom they are desperate to offload to reduce the wage bill and fill a \u00a315m financial hole. With that in mind, it was not surprising to hear Cooper talking about the need to be \u201ccreative\u201d when it comes to deals this summer and how he also hopes to utilise the loan market to strengthen a squad that is light after four experienced players were released at the end of last season and Daniel James was sold to Manchester United for \u00a315m. The reputation that Cooper built as coach during his time working for the Football Association, and the contacts that he made with leading Premier League clubs, could prove to be invaluable in that respect. \u201cIt\u2019s already started,\u201d said Cooper, when asked about trying to bring players in. \u201cAnd that process has been both ways, which has been quite rewarding really. Obviously I\u2019ll be approaching certain clubs about certain players but there\u2019s already been some mentions of players who would like to work together again.\u201d While Cooper went on to say that he had spoken to Gareth Southgate before accepting the Swansea job, and that he was grateful for the England manager\u2019s \u201ckind words and good advice\u201d, it was tempting to wonder what the conversation was like when he called his father to tell him the news. Keith, who had a distinguished career as a top-flight referee, is a Cardiff City supporter. \u201cHe\u2019s banned,\u201d said Cooper, laughing, before adding: \u201cThe family are very proud and I\u2019m doing it for them as much as everybody else. There\u2019s only one team they\u2019ll be wanting to win.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
