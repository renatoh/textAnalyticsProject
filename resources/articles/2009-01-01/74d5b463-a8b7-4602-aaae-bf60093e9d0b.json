Reason: unauthoritative. Rita Musa, Wigan &gt;&gt; One snag for me is that The Guardian only recommended two sites for blogging: Bloglines and WordPress. WordPress is great and just came out with a new version. But I haven't seen as many changes happening in Bloglines compared to Google Reader... My readership data is going to be way-skewed, but I do think Google Reader is more popular than Bloglines these days. mattcutts.com [of Google] &gt;&gt; It's a decent well thought out list with some sites getting the recognition they deserve as well as few apps which you may not have heard of. That said, it's pretty disappointing to not find Mixx included in the News Recommendation category, absolutely no mention of Friendfeed and to see Matt as one of the the best Twitter apps is frankly ridiculous. thenextweb.com &gt;&gt; [Bloglines has] turned into a trainwreck and the only context I see people writing about bloglines with now is to say that they're leaving it. philbradley.typepad.com &gt;&gt; So too, a question about how many of them may still be around in another 2-3 years, given the economic climate that may not smile so favourably on free-for-use sites such as many of these are blog.core-ed.net &gt;&gt; One of the sites selected is a personal favourite of mine \"where's the path\" a mashup of Google and OS [Ordnance Survey] mapping.. Ironic then, the publicity of the national newspaper mentions results in..[a note saying it has used its OS-imposed limit of displays per day]. Perhaps out of embarrassment, the OS may up the daily limit ? edparsons.com &gt;&gt; The Guardian put Where's The Path? in the top 100 websites. As a result, more than a few people visit it, incurring the \"absurd\" tile number restrictions that non-commercial OpenSpace users will come across. failmaps.com &gt;&gt; a quick shout-out to the guardian which has elected popurls for its annual top 100 list as one of the five best news sites on the web. cheers! pophub.com &gt;&gt; they forgot the service ://URLFAN and their Buzz Radar which to me is more transparent in regards to whats going on the blogosphere: http://www.urlfan.com/site/buzz_100/600.html urlfan crunches all the data from over a couple million rss feeds and tracks what's moving in the blogosphere. there's no human intervention so it's able to float top stories faster than the standard vote up/down digg and reddit use. according to alexa, urlfan is about to overtake reddit in terms of reach and rank so they must be doing something right. chasnote.com &gt;&gt; \"The web really is becoming the operating system.\" And no mention of Internet Explorer under the browsers category either. disassociated.com &gt;&gt; Are there any big brands in The Guardian's Top 100 sites this year? Yes - 1. That's all. Oh dear. With the exception of the BBC, (and Dilbert, Doonesbury and the CIA!), there are no non-web native brands in the Guardian's Top 100 Sites. No FMCG. No electircals. No charities. No fashion, transport, telecomms, banking. Why isn't LloydsTSB or Barclays the authority on savings rather than moneysavingexpert.com? Why isn't Canon the daddy of photosharing instead of Flickr, Picasa or Picnik? Why isn't 02 the social network instead of Facebook? Why isn't HMV the godfather of online music recommendation? Why? Why? Why? It's obvious isn't it? Brands still aren't embracing the digital space. knitwareblog.com &gt;&gt; Cooliris. This browser add-on is an image based search engine, in which you scroll through a \"wall\" of images to find your match, news item, or product. This approach is truly innovative and really worth trying. dereksou.blogspot.com &gt;&gt; Worth a look through although I still don't get the Twitter bias - I'm sure no-one is interested in hearing about how tired I am every 2 hours! pri.me.uk &gt;&gt; I sort of forgot to mention on here, but I launched StreetWire the a couple of weeks back. It's the hyper-local information site that I've been working on it on and off since I left moo.com. It has kittens, maps and murders. What's not to like? The Guardian have kindly included it in their top 100 sites for 2009, which means I better pull my finger out I guess. memespring.co.uk &gt;&gt; The interesting thing is how uninteresting [the list] is. Nearly everything on the list is well known, whereas a few years ago nearly everything would have been new. The reason I started blogging was because I was finding so much stuff that was just, so new, so different, so plain unbelievable..............now everything seems a bit old hat and everyone knows where to find stuff that interests them. The comment box that invites other recommendations is empty, so far anyway. The web has stagnated! fatbuddha.blogspot.com &gt;&gt; Interestingly, the geo sites that make the list of 100 total sites are broken into two categories: location and maps. They might also appear in games, social networks, reminders, search, visualization...it's so tough to put a horizontal technology into a vertical box! apb.directionsmag.com &gt;&gt; Well worth a look in December 2008 and then come back to it in December 2009 ;-) nickhorslen.blogspot.com &gt;&gt; Very excited by the future despite the tough economy and thank you to all the Guardian team for having selected Seesmic as one of the sites you like the most. blog.seesmic.com ROCK DISBAND This article states you can't use Guitar Hero Instruments with Rock Band 2. The information now generally available on the net would suggest that in fact you can and that Sony has made it a requirement? A simple search will show this. Important information if you are into this type of game. It seems Sony have made it a requirement that all such games have to be cross compatible. James McBride, by email SNOW LEOPARD'S SPOTS Rob Enderle is primarily a self-serving fool, and especially when it comes to describing anything to do with Apple. Anyone who has followed Apple for more than a couple of years is aware of this so you only diminish your own credibility by using him as one of your sources. His comments today (your article \"Apple's Snow Leopard prepares to show off its spots\") were essentially content-free and harmless. You might not be so lucky another time. You will do better to choose commentators with a solid record and rely less upon such self-promoters. Peter Lovell, Rockville, Maryland US &gt;&gt; Nevertheless with Microsoft bleeding market share and Vista replacement Windows 7, which doesn't include OpenCL or anything remotely similar, not expected until June, Apple's got an opportunity not just add more users, but also extend its already heady technology lead\u2026 mac.blorge.com &gt;&gt; Parallel processing will be difficult for Apple to sell, but it'll give users snappier performance across the board in terms of moving around files, launching applications and using system utilities, according to solution providers. bettenhaussen.com &gt;&gt; I'm really excited for Snow Leopard but am still trying to figure out if Apple would be charging the full $129 for the upgrade, I don't think they will since there are no new user focused features. cybersurge.org STARTUP CULTURE: US V UK &gt;&gt; Charles Arthur points out, sensibly, that a hell of a lot of the technologies that all the other Web 3.14159 tiddlers rely on are the products of European innovation. Linux started in Finland, Skype in Estonia and Sweden, MySQL in Sweden, PHP with a Dane in Greenland. But that's far from an exhaustive list; he could have mentioned Python, which originates at the Dutch National Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in 1991, the KDE desktop for Linux from T\u00fcbingen, the KML geo-descriptive language which underpins Google Earth, Google Maps, and which might have originated with an idea of Chris Lightfoot's which I can't now trace, GSM, UMTS and LTE mobile phone networks - so let's leave it at the OpenStreetMap, the Symbian and UIQ mobile device operating systems, the world's best political software team at MySociety, and even Internet exchanges themselves. fistfulofeuros.net WHO'S CALLING? You and your readers no doubt find untraceable cold calls from outside the UK annoying, especially if - like myself - you are registered with the Telephone Preference Service. Your article wisely suggests that the only realistic (\"non British\") solution is to hang up immediately. But I prefer a slightly more aggressive tack. Every time I get an automated call with a recorded message prompting me to connect, I gleefully follow the instructions and make sure I sound most excited to participate in the offer when the operator answers. And then I politely ask him or her to hold the line for a moment, and put the handset down next to the telephone while I carry on with my business. If cold callers want to waste my time, I'm more than happy to waste theirs. So far I've wasted as much as five minutes of one operator's time, before he evidently realised and hung up. If every recipient of a cold call did the same, the economy of bulk calling to minimise live operator work would rapidly evaporate. To further defuse frustration, a nascent Facebook group has been created to share this (and other) tactics to waste the time of time wasters. http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=62493788312 James Brown, Glasgow 3D WEB &gt;&gt; In other words, 3D for marketing and sales. Sigh. readwriteweb.com PUZZLER According to question 37 of your quiz the government actually has a service on which it is actually possible to report your death. Whilst there may be a web service available to do this, I do not believe technology has advanced to the point where dead people can report their deaths. If the technology does exist, I look forward to you covering it in a forthcoming article, together with some reports from beyond the grave. John Gill, Ottowa, Canada DARK FIBRE Time was when every IT trade journal carried a line or two about the huge overcapacity in dark fibre and the absence of anything over the horizon that might serve to make use of it. Then along comes the BBC with its iPlayer. Do we hear any \"Thank yous\" ? Of course not, only moans from ISP's about bandwidth being saturated. However what they are talking about are their links from BT exchanges to the end user's homes and the lack of capacity in their Points of Presence. Complaints about Level 3 pricing are a side issue. Looking to a charging model as a means of resolving the problem is one approach, but this on its own will not create affordable increases in capacity, merely throttle demand. And why are we in such a dire a position? Simple \u2013 OFCOM's slavish adherence to an outdated Brownite theology which dictates that only the market place should guide investment decisions. And what has this market place given us? A duopoly \u2013 on one hand good old BT wearing a Wholesale hat and on the other Virgin Media. There is currently no other reliable effective way of getting the Internet into your home in this country, in spite of claims to the contrary by USB broadband stick vendors. (Not quite true: satellite internet does work but cheap it is not) There is third way. Russia has just announced a national WiMax initiative \u2013 but it won't happen here. And why? \u2013 thanks to Treasury greed and shortsightedness the UK spectrums will be auctioned off to the highest bidders \u2013 and who will these be? \u2013 those who have most to lose from its inevitable success \u2013 the mobile phone companies - and what will they do with WiMax? One guess - make sure it does not undermine their 3G revenues. Of course OFCOM will commission a study, invite consultation, maybe even carry out a review \u2013 heady stuff \u2013 but what's the betting that lack of effective competition will not be attributed to HM Govt policy?
