Her ancestors told her once that there was a river, a crystal river, a waterless bed. They also said there were trout there fat as tree-trunks and kingfishers bright as blue spears - men there without cinders in their boots, men without dogs on leashes. She did not notice the world die nor the sun expire. She was already swimming at ease in the magic crystal river."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
