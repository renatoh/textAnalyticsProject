Sasha, a four-year-old labrador, was killed along with her handler, Lance Corporal Kenneth Rowe, in a Taliban ambush in July 2008. The two were shot dead while on patrol from a remote base in Helmand province. The PDSA Dickin medal, to be awarded in May, was introduced in 1943 and is regularly described as the animals' Victoria Cross. Lance Corporal Rowe's mother Lyn welcomed the award: \"Kenneth always adored animals and loved working with his dogs. He took his role protecting his fellow soldiers very seriously. We are so proud of him and he would be incredibly proud that Sasha's bravery is being recognised.\" Rowe was with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, attached to the 2nd Battalion of the Parachute regiment. Sasha is credited with 15 finds, detecting explosive devices as well as mortars, mines and other weapons. The PDSA director general, Jan McLoughlin, said: \"We are extremely proud to be awarding a posthumous PDSA Dickin medal to military working dog Sasha, which is the highest award any animal can receive for lifesaving bravery in military conflict.\" \"Sasha's exceptional devotion to duty in Afghanistan saved many lives, both soldiers and civilians.\" The award will bring to 65 the number of Dickin medals awarded to animals in war: 29 dogs, 32 second world war messenger pigeons, three horses and a cat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
