The Italian intends to give Bobby Zamora, Kyle Walker and Daniel Sturridge first starts for their country in the friendly, with the latter's debut to trigger a \u00a31m payment from Chelsea to Manchester City as part of the fee set by a Premier League tribunal for the youngster. John Terry will lead the side out and will addressthe media as part of his captain's duties on Monday, buthe will not be permitted to speak on allegations that he racially abused Anton Ferdinand in a defeat at Queens Park Rangers last month, claims that have prompted separate Metropolitan police and Football Association investigations. Capello said that, while the surprise win over Spain should serve as encouragement, an awkward occasion awaits against Erik Hamren's Sweden when the onus will be thrust more on to the hosts to unlock the visitors' stubborn defence. \"The result [against the Spanish] was really important because of the effect on the confidence of the team,\" said the Italian. \"In the past, sometimes, they have lost that confidence, so to beat Spain was really important for them. But, when you think your opponents are better than you, you know you have to play at the top. Your concentration and focus are right at that level, all game. \"What is difficult is when you play a team who thinks you are better than them. Then you really need to be able to play at that top level. This is the change we need to make. Against Sweden it will be a really difficult game for us. They stay really solid on the pitch. The movement when they defend is very good, and then they play on the counter-attack. They will make it a really difficultgame. Now we have beaten Spain they will come here thinking we are good,, at the next level, so they'll know they will have to play better. But so will we. This is the next step, the really important one, that we have to take if we want to go forward and improve.\" England were heartened by the performances of Phil Jagielka, who has been released back to Everton to rest a fractured little toe on his right foot, and Joleon Lescott in central defence, displays that could yet have a knock-on effect on Rio Ferdinand's prospects of breaking back into the set-up. \"The result against Spain shows we've got a decent amount of strength in depth and good characters in the squad,\" said Jagielka. \"But I wouldn't get too carried away saying we're going to win the Euros. It was only a friendly against Spain. But it's a positive result. It was just about the lads getting a chance and trying to do well.\" Capello will experiment with an entirely different starting line-up against Sweden, whom England have not beaten in 12 meetings since Sir Alf Ramsey's team, who were the world champions at the time, won 3-1 at Wembley in May 1968. Terry will partner Bolton's Gary Cahill in central defence with Leighton Baines expected to play at left-back. Zamora, whose only appearance to date was as a second\u2011half substitute against Hungary in August 2010, will lead the line with Walker, who appeared for five minutes on Saturday, to make his first start for the senior side at right-back. Sturridge, whose form at Chelsea has been encouraging this term, will start in one of the wider positions and City are not the only side to benefit financially from his elevation from the Under-21s. The striker moved to Stamford Bridge from Manchester in the summer of 2009 for an initial \u00a33.5m fee that could rise to \u00a36.5m, with one of the additional fees built into the deal to be paid if he were to be selected for the national senior side. Yet Coventry, whose academy the 21-year-old had attended up to 2003, will also be due \u00a3100,000 from City as part of a sell-on agreement when the forward left them for Eastlands. England possible 4-3-3 v Sweden Hart; Walker, Cahill, Terry, Baines; Rodwell, Barry, Milner; Sturridge, Zamora, A Johnson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
