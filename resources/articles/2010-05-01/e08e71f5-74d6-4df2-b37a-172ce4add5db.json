The office of deputy prime minister is not formalised under Britain's constitution and bears few similarities to the vice presidency in the US, where the holder automatically assumes the duties of the president in the event of illness, death or removal from office. In fact the office of deputy prime minister has not existed for most of British political history. How much real power the holder has depends on circumstances, especially on how much the PM needs the support of the person they put into the post. The first deputy prime minister was Labour's Clement Attlee, who gained that position when he served in the war time coalition government from 1940-45 under Winston Churchill. Attlee would go on to trounce Churchill at the polls in the election that followed the break up of that coalition. In the modern era Michael Heseltine became deputy PM in 1995, appointed by John Major, who was struggling to stay in office after a string of rebellions by his own backbenchers. Tony Blair made John Prescott his deputy PM in 1997, but some saw that appointment as a grand sounding title handed out to help Labour's rank and file believe one of their own was in a powerful position. Gordon Brown appointed Peter Mandelson as an effective deputy PM in June 2009, after his position seemed increasingly precarious. Mandelson was given the title of first secretary of state, and wielded influence within government and the party, despite Labour having a deputy leader in Harriet Harman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
