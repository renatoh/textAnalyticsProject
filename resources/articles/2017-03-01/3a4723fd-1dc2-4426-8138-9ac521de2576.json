The Manchester United top scorer faces the prospect of a three-match domestic suspension, which would have been his sanction if he had been sent off for elbowing the Bournemouth defender in the 1-1 draw on Saturday and which would rule him out of the FA Cup quarter-final against Chelsea next Monday as well as the Premier League matches against Middlesbrough and West Bromwich Albion. As stamping is considered a more serious offence, Mings could receive a heavier punishment for treading on the Swede after the referee, Kevin Friend, submits his report on Monday. Both are likely to face disciplinary hearings if Friend either says he did not see the incidents at the time but would have considered them worthy of red cards or if he had only a partial view of them and asks the FA to review them. Ibrahimovic said on Saturday that the contact with Mings was accidental, claiming: \u201cIt was unlucky, he jumped into my elbow. But it was nothing on purpose.\u201d The former referee Dermot Gallagher expects the striker to be charged and banned. \u201cThe pictures do him no favours whatsoever,\u201d he told BBC 5 Live. \u201cThat will definitely be one that the FA will look at; they\u2019ll speak to the officials. Obviously they didn\u2019t [see it] because, if they\u2019d seen it, they would have acted. There\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d The 35-year-old Ibrahimovic, who has scored 26 goals this season, has served a one-match ban this season for collecting five bookings, will be eligible for both legs of United\u2019s Europa League tie with Rostov regardless of any domestic suspension. United\u2019s captain, Wayne Rooney, called for Mings to face a retrospective ban and one threatens to rule him out for a chunk of Bournemouth\u2019s relegation battle. They are the kind of incidents that could be cleared up sooner in the future after the FA announced plans to trial video assistant referees (VARs) next season. An additional official, with access to technology, could be in the stands in next season\u2019s FA Cup, able to inform the referee if a major error has been made. Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, is also a supporter of the scheme and hopes to use VARs in the 2018 World Cup. Had a VAR been used at Old Trafford on Saturday, Mings might have been sent off for the initial stamp, which would have prevented Ibrahimovic exacting retribution soon after. Friend will also discover his fate on Monday when the refereeing appointments for next weekend are announced. Officials are not automatically demoted to the lower divisions for making mistakes but it may count against the 45-year-old that he seemed to forget he had shown Bournemouth\u2019 Andrew Surman the yellow card twice before eventually sending him off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
