The stage was set for him on his return to the ground where he became a cult figure as a player, against the country he faced on his international playing debut in 1984, when he scored the decisive goal. 'It wasn't to be,' said Hughes afterwards. Despite a below-par display from England, Hughes's out-of-form Wales, hampered by a defensive mindset, looked unthreatening. Paul Robinson's toughest task on his comeback was gathering Gary Speed's meek header. In contrast, Welsh goalkeeper Paul Jones was in constant action and it was thanks to him that the score was so low. Tactically, the big dilemma for Hughes was which formation to employ with Robbie Savage suspended. His gut instinct was to adapt to 4-1-4-1, stifle England and trouble them with effective use of the wings, but he was made to go back to the drawing board after the opening goal. He failed to rewrite a winning blueprint, though, and was left to curse his luck over the late withdrawal of Andy Melville from the starting line-up. 'That disrupted us,' he said. 'We had to reorganise in the first 20 minutes and we conceded in that period. The first 20 minutes is vital to any performance.' Hughes's original plan ruled out Jason Koumas, but he was reinstated following Melville's withdrawal. The midfielder was generally ineffective before Hughes took him off and highlighted how sorely Savage's hustling energy and forcefulness were missed. England's loss of Steven Gerrard seemed negligible in comparison. 'At times we needed to free this game a little bit,' said Hughes. 'I think the presence of Robbie would have drove us on.' Elsewhere in midfield Gary Speed was preoccupied with protecting his defence, and Mark Pembridge was selected in the holding position to contain Wayne Rooney in his deep-striking role. The tussle between the ex-Evertonians was a key battle. Rooney won the confrontation and, when Carl Robinson replaced Pembridge, the teenager found more freedom, spurring England on to a late flurry of chances. Recently dropped by his club Wolves after an erratic start to the season, Jones will have enhanced his claims of reclaiming his position. It was not surprising that it took David Beckham's brilliant effort to breach his guard finally. Unfortunately for him, those in front largely let him down. The exception was Danny Gabbidon who was a tower of strength, winning several important challenges in the air and dispossessing Michael Owen at the critical moment after the Madrid striker had ghosted past a string of players. In contrast, his partner Mark Delaney had a torrid afternoon. The lack of a replacement had dissuaded Hughes from moving Delaney from his regular Wales right-back berth in his original line-up, but the Villa man's experience at centre-back, together with his pace, meant he was shifted in the Melville reshuffle. Delaney made the worst possible start with an error that culminated in England's early goal. Things did not get much better and, late on, he wasted possession, allowing Ashley Cole to start a raid that ended in Owen heading narrowly wide. The incident was an accurate reflection of Delaney's contribution. Wales's renewed penetration from the flanks, courtesy of Ryan Giggs' return to complement Craig Bellamy, was by no means constant. Giggs was frequently the target of long diagonal balls from Wales when they looked to counterattack, but overall the service to him was a letdown. There looked to be more danger from the right with the returning Simon Davies, who before this had played just 32 minutes for Wales in 13 months, doing well. Up front, John Hartson looked isolated and the logic of picking a lone striker was questionable. Starting with Rob Earnshaw, named as Wales footballer of the year on Monday, was perhaps an option Hughes should have taken rather than introducing him with his side chasing a seemingly lost cause. After this result, Wales could live to regret their disappointing results against Azerbaijan and Northern Ireland. A home win against Poland is now essential and Hughes claims he is still focused on getting it. 'I've been privileged to have this job,' he said. 'I'll work as hard as ever to get that result on Wednesday.' If they don't, the search for a willing successor to Hughes could be a long one.
