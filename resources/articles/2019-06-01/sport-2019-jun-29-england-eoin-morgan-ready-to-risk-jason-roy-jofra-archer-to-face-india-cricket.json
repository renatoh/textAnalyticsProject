The must-win scenario for Morgan\u2019s men dictates a mend-and-make-do approach to their fitness doubts. Roy, who tore a hamstring against West Indies two weeks ago, returns in place of James Vince but England will make a late call on Archer as he continues to nurse a side strain. Asked if Roy is worth the gamble, Morgan replied: \u201cJason is preparing to play. If him playing is going to rule him out long-term, then absolutely not. But if it\u2019s going to rule him out for a couple of weeks, yes. \u201cThe exact same thing applies with Archer. If it\u2019s long-term [risk], then no. If it\u2019s short-term, then yes.\u201d Clearly the fear with both players is a mid-game relapse that leaves England short on the day. Liam Plunkett is ready to step up for Archer but, with Vince having struggled to make any impact in three innings \u2013 and Roy averaging 77 this year \u2013 the temptation to restore Jonny Bairstow\u2019s regular opening partner is obvious. Morgan said: \u201cThe way Jason plays \u2013 there are two sides to it. There\u2019s that aggressive approach but there\u2019s the smart nature in which he plays as well. So regardless of the pitches, we have lost something with him not being around.\u201d Three days of glorious sunshine in south Birmingham has come to the aid of Gary Barwell\u2019s groundstaff, with Ashley Giles, the director of England cricket, having told Morgan it will be the best batting pitch of the tournament to date. Morgan accepted his side have failed to adapt to low-scoring surfaces and so this appraisal of their latest pitch, not least from a former Warwickshire stalwart, is welcome. His message to the players is to be clear with their plans, show positivity in their cricket and \u201cback it up with the courage to play that way\u201d. Taking on players such as Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli on a belting pitch makes for a mouthwatering prospect and a high-stakes game. But Morgan fancies England\u2019s experience against Kohli in particular means he will not be built up in their minds before even facing a ball. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t turn up every day and somebody gives him a 100 or fifty,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cHe still needs to earn those runs and getting your head around that as a bowling unit is important. We want to play on the best possible wicket, preferably a batting wicket, and we always do. We bat deep. We bat strong. We tend to play in high-scoring games. So it\u2019s an area that we\u2019d be more confident playing. I think everybody knows that.\u201d Morgan was asked about his own future as England captain beyond the World Cup \u2013 next up is the Twenty20 equivalent in Australia in 2020 \u2013 but he was in no mood to discuss this, insisting: \u201cIt\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about the team.\u201d But despite this the 32-year-old was in relaxed mood before a game that could define his reign, that of the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, and indeed the entire four-year project that has seen England plough resources into the one-day side like never before. This was in contrast to his press conference after Tuesday\u2019s defeat by Australia, where Morgan bristled in the main \u2013 not least when asked about Kevin Pietersen\u2019s assessment that he had backed away from Mitchell Starc, the left-armer who left him concussed with a bouncer in 2015. \u201cI always try to open up the off side,\u201d said Morgan on Saturday. \u201cIf you\u2019ve seen me bat over the last however many years, it\u2019s like a Geoffrey Boycott comment. Don\u2019t read into it.\u201d Criticism of England\u2019s results has dominated the buildup to this game, not least following a public back and forth between Jonny Bairstow, who claimed \u201cpeople were waiting for us to fail\u201d, and Michael Vaughan, the former England captain. Morgan said he was due to chat to his opener about this topic but said Bairstow was entitled to his opinion. In his own mind the support has been \u201cunbelievable\u201d and made playing in this home World Cup \u201cspecial\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
