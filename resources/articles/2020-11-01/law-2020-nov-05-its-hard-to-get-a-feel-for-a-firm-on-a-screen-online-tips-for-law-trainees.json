As many work experience opportunities have been cancelled, applicants are feeling worried. \u201cWhenever I open up a training contract application I get hit with so much anxiety,\u201d says Harry Cooper*, 22. \u201cI swear I didn\u2019t do enough during lockdown to show \u2018my drive for law\u2019.\u201d Second year law student, Sapha Habib, 19, is worried about finding the right fit as open days are taking place online. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get a feel for a firm from a computer screen,\u201d she says. Some firms are deferring start dates or taking fewer trainees than normal. \u201cIt\u2019s more competitive and some have stopped hiring altogether while they navigate the impact on work streams,\u201d says Victoria Roper, chair of the education and training committee at The Law Society. Since online work is here to stay, what impact has this made and what are the skills aspiring lawyers need in the post-Covid world? Be a self-starter In the past, trainees would have learned a lot just by sharing an office with a senior colleague. \u201cIt was the small things like hearing how partners reacted on a call, how they talked to each other, and how they handled stress. All that has gone,\u201d says Matt Maciejewski, a second year trainee at a magical circle firm, who now works from home. Working virtually takes more effort, he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be hungry for it.\u201d For legal aid work, this means increasing pressure for trainees to do hearings themselves. Simon Bennett, a partner at Fox Williams LLP, says they now have to be more visible and inquisitive, and much more entrepreneurial. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a cliche, but out of sight is out of mind,\u201d he says. Network online The work may be more solitary but some lawyers are seeing more of their clients than ever before. \u201cThe networking still has to happen, but just in a different way,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cClient calls that would previously have been done over the phone are now happening face to face online.\u201d As a result, online communication skills are more important than ever. Anna Humphrey, graduate talent partner at Taylor Wessing, says being able to continue relationships with clients is essential and you need to support them beyond just legal advice. \u201cThis can be anything from spotting new areas of opportunity, to expanding their network through new introductions.\u201d Demonstrate flexibility Being a trainee was never a nine-to-five job but the boundaries are now even more blurred. \u201cZoom calls are happening at any time,\u201d says Bennett. The work has also sped up. You may not have the hassle of being stuck on a commuter train but this means people are more available for meetings and there are less communication delays. Maciejewski says this has been a positive: not being in the office allows you more control over your working day. Be open-minded Think about which sectors will be recruiting more. Industries such as technology, private wealth and life sciences have increasing demand for legal services. Many businesses are having to get their houses in order and re-examine their real estate, resources, and demand for their services. With firms reducing office space, James Catchpole, director of the legal practice course at the City Law School, thinks applicants should also consider throwing the net wider and looking beyond their city of choice. \u201cLocation is less of an issue now,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just have to be prepared to come into the office for a couple of days a week when that is feasible.\u201d Get experience It can be hard to fill your CV when most work experience placements are not going ahead as normal. Natalie Slater, recruitment manager at Kingsley Napley, advises gaining as much relevant non-legal experience as possible, whether that is working within the hospitality sector or for an online business. Show commitment by attending webinars and virtual law fairs, connecting with local law clinics such as a Citizens Advice Bureau, and consider reaching out to newly qualified lawyers on Linked In for mentoring and advice. Habib says online experiences can be just as rewarding and attending virtual open days has opened her eyes to firms she hadn\u2019t heard of. \u201cI spoke to eight in five hours the other day and it\u2019s practically impossible to do that in real life,\u201d she says. \u201cIf anything, it\u2019s been really helpful for students like me.\u201d *name changed"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
