The visitors took the lead with a bullet header from Josh Brownhill before shutting up shop, Famara Di\u00e9dhiou doubling their advantage with a rare second-half attack. But Aboubakar Kamara\u2019s 86th-minute goal set up a heated finale in which Fulham were denied a strong penalty claim and hit the crossbar in stoppage time. Preston dropped out of the play-off spots after losing 2-0 at QPR, Eberechi Eze with both the goals, and were leapfrogged by Sheffield Wednesday, who came from behind to see off Brentford thanks to a second-half double from Steven Fletcher. A five-goal thriller at Cardiff saw the hosts running out 3-2 winners over Barnsley, who twice took the lead \u2013 Conor Chaplin scoring one and forcing another \u2013 only to be pegged back each time before Lee Tomlin rattled home the winner at the death. Jarrod Bowen took his tally to 10 in nine and sealed a 2-1 win for Hull against Stoke, who went ahead early through Sam Vokes but remain second-bottom after their defeat. Just above them sit Wigan, who led at Luton until the 87th minute, when Callum McManaman struck against his old club before George Moncur hit a vital 94th-minute winner to take his side four points clear of the drop zone. They are level on points with Middlesbrough, who defeated Charlton thanks to George Saville\u2019s first-minute tap-in to ease the pressure on Jonathan Woodgate. League One Ipswich passed up the chance to take themselves within two points of leaders Wycombe by drawing 1-1 at Coventry. The Tractor Boys took the lead after half an hour through a Will Keane header but Maxime Biamou struck early in the second half for the hosts, who went on to dominate without finding a winner. His side rise into the play-off places alongside Peterborough \u2013 who drew 2-2 at Portsmouth \u2013 and Blackpool, who beat Fleetwood Town 3-1. The other play-off spot is taken by Bristol Rovers, who came from two goals down at half-time to seal a 4-2 triumph at the home of Southend. Sol Campbell\u2019s side have now gone 12 league games without a win and sit second-bottom. Below them are Bolton, who twice went behind against Wimbledon to Marcus Forss goals but salvaged a point with Joe Dodoo\u2019s 95th-minute equaliser. The draw leaves Wimbledon three points above the drop zone, where MK Dons occupy the final slot after drawing 1-1 at Doncaster, Cameron John\u2019s late goal denying the visitors a first league win since September. Between them sit Tranmere, who drew by the same scoreline at home to Accrington Stanley. League Two The afternoon kicked off with five points separating the top seven and ended with Swindon three points clear at the top following their 3-0 win at managerless Grimsby. E\u00f3in Doyle notched his 12th goal in eight games before a Jerry Yates brace sealed his side\u2019s sixth successive win. Exeter came away from a seesawing game against Northampton with a 3-2 win that took them to second, while Forest Green remain third despite losing 2-0 at home to 10-man Scunthorpe, where the game was halted in the second half over racist abuse from the stands. Level on points in the play-off spots are Cheltenham, who cantered to a 3-0 win at Mansfield; Bradford, who saw off Newport thanks to James Vaughn\u2019s penalty, and Crewe, whose match was suspended on Friday after Macclesfield players refused to play in protest over unpaid wages. Morecambe remain at the foot of the table after their six-pointer against Carlisle ended in two points being shared, Hallam Hope\u2019s second-half strike drawing an immediate reply from John O\u2019Sullivan, while Stevenage\u2019s stalemate with Crawley Town leaves them second bottom, level on points with Morecambe but with a game in hand. Also finishing in a draw was the game between Oldham and Leyton Orient, who both stay within six points of the relegation zone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
