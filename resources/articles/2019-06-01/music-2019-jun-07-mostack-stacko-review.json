The Hornsey rapper is at the forefront of a London scene blurring the lines between Afro-pop, hip-hop, grime, and dancehall, and in 2017 alone defined the sound by appearing on ubiquitous singles such as Fisherman with J Hus, Screw &amp; Brew with Mist, and No Words with south Londoner Dave. On his debut album, Stacko, it\u2019s MoStack\u2019s turn to take the spotlight. True to form, the record is brimming with imaginative, liquid melodies, drizzled over playful Afrobeats and \u2013 on the nostalgic I Want You \u2013 UK garage. An early standout is the ostentatious Stinking Rich, featuring Dave and J Hus, with a hook that\u2019s primed for being yelled by festival crowds; following that, there\u2019s the flirty, finger-snapping Respect &amp; Love. On the Stormzy-featuring Shine Girl, MoStack pays tribute to his girlfriend over a glimmering, shuffling production, landing just the right side of sickly sweet. Over the course of 13 tracks, MoStack feels not quite as well-suited to the album format as the peers who appear as his guests \u2013 Mo\u2019s debut lacks the intricate storytelling of Dave\u2019s, or the conceptual ambition of Stormzy\u2019s. His lyrics return frequently to the same well of themes, in particular, success and loyalty. But his sun-soaked party songs still make for a joyful experience; you\u2019re likely to hear this album pouring out of cars on hot city streets all summer long."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
