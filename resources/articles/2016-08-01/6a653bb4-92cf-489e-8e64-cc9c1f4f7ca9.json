Police spokesman TJ Smith insisted that the privately funded agreement between Persistent Surveillance Systems and city police \u201cwas not a secret surveillance program\u201d. Before Wednesday, not even the mayor, city council, and board of estimates had been told about the program. \u201cThere was no conspiracy not to disclose it,\u201d Smith said. Many officials and activists thought otherwise. The office of the public defender issued a statement saying that the \u201csecrecy of the program has precluded any oversight of the technology\u2019s use\u201d and warned of \u201cabuses that are ripe from its use\u201d. American Civil Liberties Union senior policy analyst Jay Stanley said it was \u201cstunning that American police forces feel that they can use deeply radical and controversial surveillance systems\u201d in a blogpost. Persistent Surveillance Systems began working in Baltimore in January, as first reported by Bloomberg Businessweek. The Ohio-based company provides data gleaned from its aerial surveillance to police as they investigate crimes in the city. It works, according to founder Ross McNutt, like \u201cGoogle Earth with Tivo\u201d: megapixel cameras on a Cessna aircraft continuously photograph the city. The wide-area imagery used by the program allows the the department to film 32 square miles of the city in a fashion that allows investigators to move back and forth in time, following suspects. Ross McNutt, the founder of Persistent Surveillance, which owns and operates the technology, said that his company had provided the police with 102 \u201cinvestigation briefs\u201d but not all of those led to arrest. The program, according to Smith, was in use for 100 hours between January and February and another 200 hours over the summer. The small plane will continue to surveil the city for a few more weeks, when the department will begin to evaluate whether to enter into a permanent agreement. \u201cThis effectively is a mobile CitiWatch camera,\u201d Smith said, referring to the system of nearly 700 manually operated surveillance cameras spread throughout the city. \u201cBut we see a larger area than what we see with the CitiWatch camera, but what we lose is the clarity ... This is so far in the sky where the person on the ground becomes unidentifiable at this point. \u201cWe have the near real-time ability to follow up on a situation after a 911 call is made,\u201d said Smith. He provided the example of a February case in which an elderly brother and sister were shot in the area of Walbrook Junction. \u201cThe information that we gleaned from that data assisted our investigators in identifying that suspect,\u201d he said. McNutt says that two supreme court cases in the 1980s legally justify the program. The company says the imagery data, which is stored for 45 days unless it is part of investigation, can only be accessed by the company\u2019s analysts, who in turn provide information to \u201cdetectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys and the courts\u201d. Government surveillance expert Jake Laperruque said the surveillance currently practiced by Baltimore police is in unclear legal standing. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something that\u2019s currently being litigated in a number of areas,\u201d said Laperruque, a privacy fellow at the Constitution Project thinktank. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong case to be made, based on what the supreme court has said in the past, that there is a constitutional right to be free from pervasive location tracking without court authorization.\u201d He added that, absent answers from the Baltimore police about when and how the surveillance technology is used, there \u201cdefinitely is potential for serious abuse\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s to say that the Baltimore police couldn\u2019t zoom in on a protest, on a religious ceremony, on an abortion clinic, or just to track people in an arbitrary or improper manner?,\u201d he asked. This is not the first time that McNutt\u2019s company has contracted with domestic law enforcement, or even the first time the company has worked with Baltimore. McNutt told the Baltimore Sun last year that his company has previously operated in the city for a brief period in 2008. McNutt\u2019s company also surveilled Compton, California, for the Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s department and Dayton, Ohio, in previous trial programs. Like the Baltimore program, the trial in Compton was launched with no disclosure by authorities. Stanley, of the ACLU, nodded to all this history and his organization\u2019s own requests for more information on these programs. \u201cDespite all the public questioning and statements of concern by us and others, and our freedom-of-information requests, and the extensive press coverage the FBI\u2019s Baltimore flights received, the Baltimore police did not see fit to ask the public\u2019s permission to use this startling new technology on the city\u2019s population,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
