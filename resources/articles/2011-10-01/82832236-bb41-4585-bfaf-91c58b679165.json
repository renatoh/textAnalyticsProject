In fact, \"dominate\" may be too strong a term, for none of the four stars that comprise this asterism rivals the stars of the Triangle or the leading stars in any of the main winter groups. They are also well separated and the region they enclose is relatively empty. It may be the Square of Pegasus, but its brightest star, mag 2.0 Alpheratz at its top-left corner, has belonged officially to Andromeda since the International Astronomical Union fixed the constellation boundaries in 1922. For many years before that, it held a dual role, being catalogued as both Alpha Andromedae and Delta Pegasi. The rest of Andromeda stretches to the E and N, beyond the limits of our chart. That chart covers a window of sky that reaches high into Britain's S sky at 23:00 BST at present, but applies just as well at 21:00 GMT at the end of October, at 19:00 at the end of November and 17:00 as the year ends. Pegasus, the winged horse of Greek mythology, is inverted as seen from our northern latitudes, with his neck and head extending from Markab to Enif, the nose. An orange supergiant, the latter pulsates slowly and irregularly in brightness and can surpass every other star in the constellation. A line down the W side of the Square, between Scheat and Markab, points to the mag 1.2 star Fomalhaut, the mouth of Piscis Austrinus, the Southern Fish. Hovering just above our S horizon, Fomalhaut is the brightest star on our chart and notable because it has an extrasolar planet less than three times as large as Jupiter and, farther out, a dusty disc that may eventually lead to the formation of further planets. Aquarius, the Water Bearer, lies S of Pegasus and includes an asterism dubbed the Water Jar or, more recently, the Steering Wheel. A cascade of dim stars winds S from Phi and represents water flowing towards Fomalhaut. Another asterism, the Circlet, lies S of the Square and marks one of the two fish of Pisces. Extend the line from Markab to Algenib over twice its length and beyond the left of our chart towards the conspicuous (mag -2.8) planet Jupiter, now nearing is brightest and best at opposition on 29 October in Aries. The two most distant planets, Uranus and Neptune, are plotted in Pisces and Aquarius respectively, but being binocular objects, need a more detailed chart to be identified."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
