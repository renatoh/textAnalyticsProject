Or should that be locking horns. \u201cI think he\u2019s the right man. He knows what he wants and he\u2019ll drive it hard. I\u2019ve met him a few times. I quite like people who are dead straight to the point. You can\u2019t misread Eddie. You know what he\u2019s thinking because he\u2019s telling you. That\u2019s cool. He\u2019ll have to get used to working with the clubs and the restrictions in and around that. Notwithstanding that, England have more access to players than ever and there\u2019s a good enough group to be successful. A little bit of entertainment along the way, no doubt, between clubs and country \u2013 and you guys [the media] and him will be interesting.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
