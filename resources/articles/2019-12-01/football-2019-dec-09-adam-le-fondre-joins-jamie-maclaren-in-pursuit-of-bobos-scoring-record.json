Whether that individual accolade goes to Adam Le Fondre or Jamie Maclaren \u2013 or, indeed, others in the pursuing pack \u2013 may depend very much on their teammates. Because very little else separates two strikers occupying the rare kind of air where finishing is almost a given. For the moment the deficit is a single goal, courtesy of Le Fondre\u2019s first A-League hat-trick and Maclaren\u2019s first goalless game in recent memory. It\u2019s now 10 sausage rolls from eight outings for Sydney FC\u2019s coolest customer following Saturday\u2019s 5-1 rout of Brisbane Roar. Three weeks ago it seemed unlikely that the former English Premier League marksman might challenge Maclaren, the Socceroos regular still boasting nine goals from five games even after Melbourne City\u2019s listless 3-0 loss to Perth Glory. And yet here they are, shoulder to shoulder, leaving Riley McGree, Roy O\u2019Donovan, Ulises Davila et al down at about hip height on six apiece. Apart from the fact said shoulders are genuinely aligned - both stand at 177cm tall and weigh 73kg - this pair of poachers have remarkably similar outputs this campaign. Each of Le Fondre\u2019s 10 goals has been scored from inside the box - four with his right foot, three with his left, plus three headers. All Maclaren\u2019s nine also came from inside the area - four with his right, three with his left, two headers. The only real difference remaining is Maclaren\u2019s superior conversion rate (52.9 per cent, 45.9 minutes per goal) to Le Fondre (33.3 per cent, 72 minutes). So, when you have two consistent, positionally intelligent forwards who thrive on service, does that render their success or failure inextricably linked to that of their teams? Back at January\u2019s Asian Cup, even before Maclaren finally broke his international duck against Palestine and quashed the disparaging Scott McDonald comparisons, Socceroos assistant coach and former Manchester United assistant Rene Muelensteen was waxing lyrical about his superb movement. The 26-year-old might not often go hunting for the ball, but he knows precisely where it\u2019s going to drop. The thing is, it does need to be dropping for him. When City have been on, their new cult hero has showcased his wares with endearing alacrity. When they have not, he\u2019s been starved, and so too has the opposition net. One gets the distinct sense Maclaren, too, would have had a hat-trick had he been hassling and harassing in Le Fondre\u2019s shoes on Saturday evening, such was the class of the 33-year-old Englishman\u2019s service. Steve Corica\u2019s restyled Sky Blues attack has taken time to get going, a bit of oil added each week to lubricate the machine that churned out five goals against Brisbane and propelled them five points clear at the top. The first 45 minutes alone was evidence of the collective headway that\u2019s encouraged Le Fondre\u2019s exploits. When Kosta Barbarouses signed from Melbourne Victory in the off-season he probably didn\u2019t envisage a role more resembling provider than scorer. And yet the Kiwi conjurer constituted his side\u2019s crucial link via three first-half assists, two for Le Fondre and one for Milos Ninkovic. They came amid a trio of near-identical passages of play, instigated by a piercing midfield incision prompting a right-flank raid and then a cross from Barbarouses for a straightforward finish. Ninkovic produced the first graceful pass from deep, undoubtedly prompting frenzied cheque-book manoeuvring from his Macarthur admirers in the process. And Western Sydney, still in freefall at the hands of the VAR and their own inertia, may have observed with a hint of envy Alex Baumjohann\u2019s through ball to set up the second, before Rhyan Grant kickstarted the third. The point being that this marked a consummate night for Le Fondre, but one not possible without the arresting exhibition going on behind him: his \u201csupporting cast\u201d, as he called them last week. If a somewhat less-energetic final 45 minutes offered any insight, it\u2019s that the defending champions have another few gears to shift through yet. But so bloodthirsty was the whole disembowelment it\u2019s a wonder the pitch-side Robbie Fowler still had his small intestine sufficiently intact for his discerning post-match realisation that \u201cquality players hurt you, we got done by good play\u201d. To be fair, that\u2019s not untrue. Yes, it\u2019s worth noting the sharp discrepancy between Sydney and City\u2019s respective opposition this round. To paint the Roar\u2019s first-half malfunction as mediocre is a kind way of saying their cluelessness at times was borderline embarrassing, underpinned by sheer perplexity both with the ball and without. Conversely, Perth Glory\u2019s Friday-night reawakening had been coming and Tony Popovic\u2019s premiers dished out what had, until this point, been served up to them. Bruno Fornaroli took his unacceptable skinfolds to his old home ground of AAMI Park and opened the scoring, which allowed his new side to sit back, compress City\u2019s space and close off passing avenues to Maclaren. But as organised as Glory were, City were equally anomalous in their lethargy, their languor deservedly dragging them from their table-top mantle and chastening their early season premiership hopes. The result on the pitch was an isolated striker helplessly watching long balls fly over his head. Maclaren had 18 touches in 90 minutes. Until that point he\u2019d scored multiple goals in each of his previous four A-League starts, something not achieved since Damian Mori for Adelaide City in March 1996. Whether he\u2019s back on top come late April could lie in City\u2019s ability to perform in high-pressure matches. The hiccup against Glory has only fuelled doubts that surfaced in October\u2019s 4-0 FFA Cup final defeat to Adelaide. Maclaren was, incidentally, goalless in that match too. Likewise, Le Fondre\u2019s path is partly at the mercy of whether Sydney continue their formidable form. Based on this latest win, their seventh from eight games, no rival comes close."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
