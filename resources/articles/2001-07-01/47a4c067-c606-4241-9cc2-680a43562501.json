Cash machine network Link said \u00a34.15bn was taken out of hole-in-the-wall machines in June, a 54% hike compared with the same month last year. Trevor Jenkins, general manager for service delivery at Link, said: \"The hot weather has contributed to a surge in transactions level, with people visiting summer events such as Wimbledon and Ascot.\" But despite the weather and special events, the old-fashioned lure of pay day still played its part in bolstering the figures. The busiest day of the month was June 29, the last working day and pay day for many people. A total of \u00a3248m from Link machines on that Friday. Link, which is based in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, has over 33,000 cash machines in the UK and over 80m cards in issue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
