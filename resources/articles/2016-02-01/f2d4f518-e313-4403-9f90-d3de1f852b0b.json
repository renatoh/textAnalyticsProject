Joe Schmidt said McCarthy had been advised to take a break with a view to the Leinster lock returning next season. \u201cMike McCarthy has seen a specialist now and he\u2019s going to effectively re-condition himself, freshen himself up to kick-start next season now,\u201d the Ireland coach said. The back-row O\u2019Brien and the wing Kearney are also set to miss the rest of the Six Nations after damaging a hamstring and shoulder respectively. Jonathan Sexton took part in Friday\u2019s training for the England game at Twickenham on 27 February next Saturday after suffering what Schmidt called a whiplash injury against France, a game when he was subject to heavy tackling and was replaced near the end of the 10-9 defeat. The fly-half rolled his ankle during the training session but Schmidt said he would be able to train on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
