The bestselling children\u2019s novelist, who has often been asked why she hasn\u2019t written more about gay characters, tackles the topic in her 111th book, Love Frankie, in which tomboy Frankie falls for Sally, the prettiest girl in her class. Wilson told Guardian Review in an interview published on Saturday that she had put her \u201cheart and soul\u201d into the story, and said she knew \u201cperfectly well that it would shine a little light on my own private life\u201d. Although it is not news to those who know her, she has not previously spoken publicly about her her partner Trish, whom Wilson met at a party after her marriage broke down in her early 50s. \u201cI\u2019ve never really been in any kind of closet. It would be such old news for anybody that has ever known anything much about me. Even the vaguest acquaintance knows perfectly well that we are a couple,\u201d she said. The only person to be \u201cappalled\u201d at her relationship was her mother, she added. But: \u201cthat wasn\u2019t too devastating for me because my mum cordially hated my ex-husband; she didn\u2019t really approve of any of my friends.\u201d The former children\u2019s laureate, who is 74, was speaking to the Guardian from her home in Sussex. The author of some of the UK\u2019s best-loved children\u2019s books, from Hetty Feather to Tracy Beaker, Wilson said that she hadn\u2019t previously focused a novel on a gay character because she was telling stories about children with problems, and she didn\u2019t see \u201cany problem whatsoever with being gay\u201d. Love Frankie, which is due to be published in August, also features a sick mother, separation, bullying and sibling rivalry. Wilson says she wanted to write: \u201ca truthful, honest book about a girl falling in love with another girl. It\u2019s certainly not aimed at young gay teenagers, it\u2019s aimed at all teenagers who have ever worried because they haven\u2019t fallen in love, or they have fallen in love.\u201d Wilson added that she doesn\u2019t see herself as a mentor for teens struggling to come to terms with their sexuality. \u201cI don\u2019t think that girls would ever want a grey-haired, wrinkly writer as a role model if they were wanting to feel good about maybe being gay,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure they could find much more glamorous examples.\u201d A novelist friend, she said, once told her: \u201cI don\u2019t think you are a lesbian, I think you are a Trishian.\u201d And Wilson replied: \u201cI think that really sums me up.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
