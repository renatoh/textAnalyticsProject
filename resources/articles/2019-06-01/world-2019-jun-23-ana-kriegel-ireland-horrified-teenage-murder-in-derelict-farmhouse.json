He had exciting news: his friend, whom she had a crush on, wanted to meet her. Ana was delighted. She grabbed her hoodie and followed him through a park to a derelict farmhouse where his friend, also aged 13, was waiting. It was a trap. The object of her affection had prepared for this moment, assembling what police would later call a \u201cmurder kit\u201d: zombie mask, black gloves, shin guards, knee pads. His weapons were a long stick and a concrete block. What unfolded inside that house led last week to both boys, now aged 14, becoming the youngest people in Irish history to be convicted of murder. The case has shocked Ireland and evoked comparisons to the 1993 James Bulger atrocity. \u201cWhat has shaken our fundamental assumptions about childhood is that the convicted perpetrators of this crime are children themselves,\u201d said Chris McCusker, a lecturer in clinical psychology at University College Cork. \u201cIt invites a lynch-mob mentality, fuelled by assumptions of evil in our midst.\u201d Social media \u2013 in its worst form \u2013 bookends the case. Ana had few friends and was lonely. She sought to connect with peers via YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and other platforms only to end up bullied \u2013 targeted for sexual innuendo and threats. One comment on her YouTube channel expressed a desire to \u201chave her executed\u201d. Her offence was to be slightly different: adopted from Russia, she was tall, striking and had poor short-term memory, eyesight and hearing, the latter the result of a tumour she\u2019d had removed. She was deemed socially awkward, a \u201cweirdo\u201d. Social media abuse dehumanised her and now, in death, seeks to avenge her. Threats last week rained on her killers and their families \u2013 at anyone deemed players in her tragedy. Citing the Children Act that prohibits identification of minors accused or convicted of a crime, the trial judge, Justice Paul McDermott, banned identification of the boys. The boy who brutalised \u2013 and sexually assaulted Ana \u2013 is known as Boy A; his friend who delivered her to the farmhouse, Boy B. Both denied the charges. Cyber-vigilantes have flouted the ban by naming the pair and posting their pictures on Twitter and Facebook, along with lurid incitements. They have also made threats against their families, a teacher and other boys wrongly identified as the killers. A lawyer for Boy B said the family had gone into hiding. Detectives from the Garda station in Lucan who carried out the murder investigation are now hunting the would-be avengers, who could face up to three years in jail. Twitter and Facebook \u2013 accustomed to red-carpet treatment by the authorities in Dublin, where they have their European headquarters \u2013 have been sucked into the imbroglio. Representatives from both companies were summoned to a court hearing on Thursday to face contempt of court accusations over the publication of photographs identifying the killers. Lawyers said the companies could not block in advance what users posted nor pre-empt naming of the boys since the companies did not know the boys\u2019 names. Justice Michael White upheld an injunction requiring the companies to remove any material identifying the boys but tweaked the wording so that they are expected to act after being made aware of such material. He branded social media users who identified the killers as \u201cidiots\u201d and urged the police to pursue them \u201cwith vigour\u201d. It is a fraught, messy aftermath to a case that will haunt Ireland. Tusla, the state\u2019s children and family agency, issued guidance for parents unsure how to discuss it with children. \u201cThe trial may elicit a range of feelings such as shock, anger, upset, feeling unsafe, or difficulty in trusting others. Children and young people \u2026 may need reassurance that these feelings are normal \u2026 [and] may need help to express their feelings of sadness and bewilderment as to how this could happen.\u201d A seven-week trial filled with harrowing details left adult observers feeling the same way. The judge thanked the jury members for their service and excused them further service for life. Ana was born in February 2004 in Novokuznetsk, in western Siberia. She was adopted two years later by Geraldine and Patric Kri\u00e9gel. Geraldine was a manager at the state transport company. Patric taught French at Dublin Institute of Technology. Ana enjoyed primary school but a teacher expressed fear her innocence and distinctiveness would attract mockery in secondary school. The bullying soon followed, and it was merciless. Ana was derided for having a \u201cfake mam and dad\u201d, sexually harassed, shunned. \u201cYou would see other girls walking in groups, and Ana would be walking alone,\u201d Geraldine told the court. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t understand her. She was unique and full of fun,\u201d said Patric. \u201cShe said she felt invisible.\u201d Ana set up fake accounts from which she sent bullying messages to herself \u2013 expressions of pain and yearning for attention, according to her parents. Boy A appeared an unlikely murderer. Described by teachers as courteous and intelligent, he was said to be from a stable middle-class home. After the killing, however, police discovered disturbing material on his electronic devices including more than 12,000 pornographic images, many depicting sexual violence, plus searches for torture methods and \u201cabandoned places in Lucan\u201d. Boy B told detectives that a month before the murder, Boy A approached him. \u201cHe came up to me and said, \u2018Hey, wanna kill somebody?\u2019 I said no. He replied with, \u2018Ah, here. Why not\u2019. [I said] because it\u2019s retarded. I then asked him who he was planning to kill and he replied \u2018Ana Kri\u00e9gel\u2019.\u201d Boy B called at Ana\u2019s home at 4.55pm on 14 May 2018 and said Boy A wished to meet her. Leaving the house she smiled at her father and said: \u201cI won\u2019t be long.\u201d Boy B led Ana through a park to Glenwood House, an abandoned property. He told detectives he fled when Boy A began attacking Ana. He heard her scream. Prosecutors said forensic evidence showed she fought for her life. The jury was shown a concrete block and metre-long stick stained with her blood. Builder\u2019s tape was looped around her neck. There were about 60 areas of injury to her body. Boy A\u2019s semen was found on a torn top. When questioned both boys denied any knowledge of the killing. Boy A denied involvement even after police found the \u201cmurder kit\u201d in a backpack at his home. Told Ana\u2019s blood had been found on his boots, he replied: \u201cAre you joking me? Are you actually being serious?\u201d Court nine in the Criminal Courts of Justice was hushed when the verdicts came last Tuesday. Members of the Kri\u00e9gel family held hands, hugged and sobbed. Boy A appeared upset. His father held his hand. His mother wept. Boy B bowed his head and hugged his mother. His father stormed out, slamming a door, then returned and gave a slow handclap in protest, saying: \u201cAn innocent child is going to prison.\u201d Both boys were remanded into custody pending probation reports and sentencing. In Ireland, children convicted of crimes are seldom sentenced to more than three years but for serious crimes judges have discretion to impose longer sentences. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said the government will study a UK plan to restrict access to pornography. McCusker, the clinical psychologist, said the internet and social media were infiltrating consciousness and in some cases normalising sexual violence. \u201cThat Pandora\u2019s box is not easily closed, and it continues to spew its contents \u2026 what do the emergent and often confused psyches of teenagers have to filter against this assault?\u201d A toddler from Russia who became Irish, a vibrant, vulnerable teenager who loved to sing and dance and craved friendship but ended up bullied and murdered: Ana Kri\u00e9gel\u2019s fate shames and bewilders Ireland. Speaking to RTE as they left the court it was left to her devastated parents to find a glimmer in the darkness. \u201cAna was a dream come true for us and she always will be.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
