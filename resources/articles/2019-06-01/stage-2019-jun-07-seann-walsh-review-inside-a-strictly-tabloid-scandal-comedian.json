The public loved him; the primetime success he longed for beckoned. Four weeks into Strictly he was, as he puts it, \u201cthe most hated comedian in Britain\u201d, his relationship was in ruins, his mental health was in freefall. So what happened? Six months on, Walsh is touring with his side of the tawdry tabloid tale about a dancer, a \u201clove rat\u201d comic and their illicit kiss. Some may see it as special pleading, but it is the most engaging show of his career. That\u2019s not saying a great deal: Walsh has always been a gifted standup but his earlier work was marked more by loud laddishness than charm. Tonight though, he is chastened and showing a vulnerable side \u2013 or eager to claw back public sympathy. The show traces his life story, from 10-year-old Jim Carrey fan via rookie standup to the \u201ctoo much, too young\u201d tyro flunking his big breaks in telly. Doors closed, bridges were burned: when Strictly came calling, he saw it as his last tilt at the big time. That backstory, and his take on Strictly, cast Walsh as a victim, albeit occasionally of his own careless decisions. By this account, he was completely blindsided by the fuss around the Katya kiss \u2013 as if reality TV weren\u2019t well established as a source of prurient tabloid blather. He dismisses with a joke his ex-girlfriend\u2019s accusations of gaslighting \u2013 a little glibly \u2013 and dwells on the Twitter abuse and panic attacks he suffered as the ruckus raged. But if it\u2019s easy to identify the lacunae in Walsh\u2019s version of events, there is no denying he gives an intense, involving account of them, playing the frustrated entertainer whose bid for \u201cthe love of strangers to fill the void in [his] self-esteem\u201d rebounds catastrophically. There remain traces of the cynical Walsh of yesteryear. But there are lovely routines too: his Irish dad dancing, say, or his dumbshow on the contrast between blurting out one\u2019s every thought, social media-style, and keeping politely shtum. It\u2019s no mea culpa, but it offers a vivid snapshot of life in the eye of a media storm. \u2022 At Colchester Arts Centre, 9 July. Then Pleasance Dome, Edinburgh, 31 July-25 August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
