Ferguson's support of Controlled Event Solutions was apparently recorded in 2007 as part of its bid submission for security contracts at the 2010 World Cup. But three years later it still has pride of place on the front page of the company's website. In a two-minute video message Ferguson says: \"I know [CES's director-owners] Henry Kirkland and Mike Halligan very, very well. Solid, absolutely wonderful professionals. We are a team and they are part of that team. I include physios, doctors, coaches, my players and myself. We are 100% a team, otherwise we're never going to win the things we want to win. I hope when South Africa have the World Cup games, CES will be a part of that.\" Whether Ferguson's message was intended for public consumption or simply for a private World Cup tender is unknown \u2013 CES could not be reached for comment yesterday. But the firm's reputation among a section of United's support has suffered with its handling of increasing anti-Glazer protests. A United spokesman said: \"There are tens of thousands of United fans who turn up every week and have a very good relationship with CES.\" CES's actions at United's 2-1 home defeat by Chelsea on Saturday, in which stewards and police blocked the Stretford End's upper-tier aisles to prevent anti-Glazer banners being hung, has prompted formal complaints from fans who claim it contravened the club's own stadium-safety policy. United say the blockage was necessary to fulfil its obligations to all supporters under the terms of the stadium safety licence. Praise meant sweet FA One of the passages in the fateful email that confirmed Ian Watmore could have no future as chief executive of the Football Association three weeks ago was an attempt at high praise for the chairman, Lord Triesman, that backfired. Watmore, who had worked with Triesman as a senior civil servant in the latter's government department, wrote of him: \"He is a man of ethics, character, courage and intellect rare in my experience of any walk of life, let alone football.\" But those last three words alienated his audience, who were principally the board of the FA. In the return email, Phil Gartside wrote: \"The inference 'let alone football' could be used by any recipient to imply that those in football do not [possess] any of the qualities which are mentioned.\" Within 24 hours Watmore was gone. No Chance for County Interesting developments at First London plc, the finance house Notts County fans feel should stump up \u00a35m after the collapse of Munto Finance's ill-starred ownership of their club. First London provided the proof of funds to County's then owner, the supporters' trust, which persuaded it to sell up. That document stated: \"The bank will guarantee any sum short of the \u00a35m not invested by or on behalf of the 'client' [Munto] up to and including a total figure of \u00a35m.\" Munto disappeared from the scene following Guardian investigations into the club's and bank's links with Russell King, who had \u00a31.9m of assets frozen by the courts in the Channel Islands. The new owner, Ray Trew, says the previous regime left more than \u00a36m of debt, suggesting the spirit of the guarantee was not upheld. Now Companies House documents record that First London's non-executive directors, the Tory MP Tim Yeo and Princess Michael of Kent's private secretary, Nick Chance, resigned their posts last month. Fayed's favourite salute Mohamed Al Fayed, below, has given so many two-fingered salutes lately it is a wonder he is not suffering from repetitive-strain injury. After West Ham complained about Fulham's fielding of a weakened side in their recent defeat by Hull City, Fayed said: \"I stick two fingers up to West Ham.\" Then, speaking about takeover approaches for Harrods, Fayed said: \"I put two fingers up to them all.\" Proof positive that you do not need a British passport to uphold the Agincourt tradition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
