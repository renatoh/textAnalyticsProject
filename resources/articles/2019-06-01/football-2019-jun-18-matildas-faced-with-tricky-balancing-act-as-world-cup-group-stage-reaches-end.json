We need to win a game of football against Jamaica and we will see where the path takes us.\u201d With a myriad of permutations open to the Matildas, coach Ante Milicic is trying to keep things simple against a tricky opponent, irrespective of current placings. Jamaica\u2019s prospects of progressing are slim \u2013 yet within that dangerous sweet-spot of being remote enough that any burden of expectation is off \u2013 but not entirely impossible and a surprise early goal or VAR intervention the Reggae Girlz could yet pose headaches. In terms of preparation therefore, it\u2019s almost the hardest game for Australia\u2019s coaching staff as they look to balance several goals at once. Firstly they need to secure the result, secondly to rest key players for later in the tournament and thirdly to give key minutes to those needing either the kilometres under the bonnet or the confidence. But most importantly, none of this can jeopardise the first key priority, qualifying. It\u2019s a tricky task. Rest too many key players and it smacks of disrespect \u2013 even the most unfancied of opponents often rise to such provocations. But roll out a first choice XI and you miss a golden opportunity to secure marginal gains for later in the tournament through clever management of workloads. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly detailed process,\u201d Milicic said. \u201cWe always said when we started camp in Turkey that we had to individualise our periodisation, and now even though we are all together as a group there are still areas that we look at daily. That\u2019s the reason behind a few girls not training and they completed a different type of session this morning.\u201d Under perfect skies in Grenoble two of those to play every minute so far, Emily van Egmond and Ellie Carpenter sat out, as did player of the match from the Brazil game, Chloe Logarzo, while Elise Kellond-Knight also opted out of training after warm up. None are definite injury scratchings, with Milicic suggesting Clare Polkinghorne as perhaps the only player not 100% for the Jamaica game, but there are plenty waiting in the wings who could see vital match time. Chasing her 150th cap, veteran Lisa De Vanna will be champing at the bit for the opportunity to score at a fourth World Cup and could come in for Caitlin Foord who has got through a power of work so far. Katrina Gorry is another knocking at the door \u2013 she could come into the engine room allowing the hard-working Tameka Yallop or Van Egmond a rest. Gema Simon is also a chance at left-back, should Kellond-Knight not pull up well from her first 90 minutes in three months against Brazil, with Mary Fowler a potential cameo late on, perhaps giving skipper Sam Kerr an early respite \u2013 should things be tracking well for the Matildas. As for Jamaica, it\u2019s very hard to know where this team is at. Showing glimpses of quality in attack against Brazil, through the bustling industry of Khadija Shaw they remain good for a goal \u2013 even if that\u2019s eluded them so far. In goals, teenager Sydney Schneider has been a revelation, 17-year-old striker Jody Brown is a rising talent, while Cheyna Matthews\u2019 return to the NWSL after giving birth shows remarkable determination. Overarching all of this is the inspirational story of Cedella Marley \u2013 daughter of Bob \u2013 whose salvation of the team has been well documented. With nothing to lose, Jamaica could put in their strongest performance yet \u2013 especially after an early adverse VAR call handed Italy vital early momentum during their 5-0 win. In Australia\u2019s favour the need not just for a strong performance but also to reverse a +6 goal difference in comparison with current Group C leaders Italy, should spur the Matildas on. \u201cWe feel like we definitely didn\u2019t play our best football in the first game,\u201d Emily Gielnik said. \u201cAnd it definitely wasn\u2019t our best in the second game, but it was better. So we have got momentum and we\u2019re getting stronger and stronger.\u201d And having played just seven games under Milicic it\u2019s unlikely complacency will have set in among the squad \u2013 especially given the shock loss in Valenciennes coming as it did, just nine days earlier. With their backs against the wall, Australia performed admirably against Brazil. But backed in as favourites against Italy, the Matildas flattered to deceive. With fans and pundits expecting Australia to dominate this final group stage game becomes another kind of challenge. A win in Grenoble, and a handsome one at that, may just show another important maturation for the Matildas, as they look to keep their finals target on track.
