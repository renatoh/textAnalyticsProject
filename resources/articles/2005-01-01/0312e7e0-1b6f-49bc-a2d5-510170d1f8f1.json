Tel: 01929 400404. Website: lulworthbeachhotel.com. First impressions: White-washed Edwardian building overlooking a duck pond. Not as close to the beach as the name suggests but as near as a hotel can get on this protected stretch of world heritage coastline. Log fires in the reception-restaurant area provide a warm welcome. Upstairs, a dog-eared hall carpet lets the side down, but the residents' lounge has fab views of Lulworth Cove, only 50 yards away. What are the rooms like? Traditional seaside guest house (naff anaglypta wallpaper) crossed with boutique hotel (African bleached wood). Most have partial sea views (if you lean into the window bay). Room 21 has a private veranda. The bed test: King-size comfort zone dressed in white Egyptian cotton and a pile of pillows. The bathroom: Functional but basic with curious shell-motif sanitary ware and no heating. The restaurant: Fresh local fish and game (roasted sea bass, Lulworth scallops, breast of Purbeck pheasant) served in a relaxed informal restaurant-bar room with light contemporary decor, candles, wood floors and a sea-facing terrace. It's popular at weekends with non-residents, so booking is essential. What is there within walking distance? The beach at Lulworth Cove (scene of Kevin Spacey's Bobby Darin biopic, Beyond The Sea), white-cliff footpaths along the Jurassic coast to Durdle Door or even Weymouth (a 12-mile hike), the Lulworth visitor centre and the Beach Cafe (seafood, BYO wine and dancing on the tables, courtesy of Beach House owner Philip Rudd), open at weekends during the summer. How much? Bed and breakfast \u00a360 per room per night (or from \u00a375 at weekends). Three-course dinner around \u00a325-\u00a330 per head."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
