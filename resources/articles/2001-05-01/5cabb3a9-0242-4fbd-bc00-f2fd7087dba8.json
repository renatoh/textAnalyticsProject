The most crucial week of Sven-Goran Eriksson's reign is this one. Having made the best start of any England manager since Walter Winterbottom, Eriksson can at last get to know the players who have got him so far so fast. Up until now squad get-togethers have been short, practical affairs - a rushed friendly against Spain followed by a tension-charged double-header with Finland and Albania, where qualifying points were the overriding concern. But in this instance Eriksson has the luxury of the friendly against Mexico plus real quality time to work with his players away from their clubs, pubs and the million other diversions of the modern footballer. Such time is precious and nothing has been left to chance. Preparations for next week's qualifier against Greece have been in the pipeline for months - even before Eriksson left Lazio. The caretaker coach Peter Taylor, well in advance, highlighted the need to make the most of the available time before the June 6 match. With no Group 9 fixture to fulfil on June 2, plans for a training camp were devised. La Manga has been chosen for a number of reasons, chief among them the need for the players to acclimatise to the heat awaiting them in Athens on Wednesday week. The FA's travel manager Brian Scott has a wish-list of criteria for England training facilities. These include a nearby airport; at least two first-class pitches; a self-contained living area, so the players can relax unmolested; conference space to set up medical facilities and leisure time pursuits; a gymnasium; a swimming pool; and, of course, the ultimate footballing necessity - a golf course. La Manga is perfect. After the match in Derby Eriksson was clearly relishing the fact that at last he had a substantial period of time to work with the players in an environment that can be properly controlled. Nutrition can be monitored, vitamin supplements regulated and players educated about eating habits. Psychological goals can also be addressed in terms of team-building and bonding. The isolation of the camp enhances concentration and focus. As there are no time pressures, intensive coaching and quality time can be put in, both with individuals and with specific units such as the back four. All outside influences can be controlled. Media and commercial activities can be scheduled at specific times and shared among the squad. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger always insists his pre-season training camps, usually somewhere in Germany, are free of press commitments to promote concentration and relaxation. There are drawbacks of course. Hotel fatigue is a particular problem and keeping the players entertained during rest periods and free time is crucial. When Aston Villa stayed at the Grim's Dyke Hotel in Harrow prior to last year's FA Cup final, John Gregory had a marquee erected on the lawn with electronic games, a mini bowling alley, a pool table and a widescreen TV, specifically to keep the players occupied. England will make similar arrangements in La Manga. In this era of mobile phones, laptops and DVD players, the task is much easier. On an England Under-21 trip to Portugal in 1995, when the use of mobile phones abroad was relatively rare, David Beckham and Phil Neville, then low-paid youth-team players, were devastated to learn that they had run up a hotel phone bill in excess of \u00a3200 just keeping in touch with family and friends in an effort to amuse themselves. As a rule, though, England players get off lightly so far as hotel fatigue is concerned. Steve McManaman, interviewed prior to this year's Cup final, said he was still coming to terms with the amount of time Spanish players spend cooped up before games. In Italy, too, players can find themselves in hotels for two or three days before a match, in a way that would be seen as excessive over here. It is a small price to pay for the opportunity to get further down the road to Japan and Korea. And, if Eriksson really gets to know his players, who knows how far behind he might leave Walter Winterbottom's record?
