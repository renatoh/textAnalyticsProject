Shortly after the electoral commission in Kiev declared the pro-Moscow prime minister, Viktor Yanukovich, as the winner, Mr Powell said: \"If the Ukrainian government does not act immediately and responsibly there will be consequences for our relationship.\" Pressed on what punitive action, if any, would be taken, Mr Powell said: \"At the moment we're not taking any action. We want to see what the ultimate results are.\" Earlier, a commission spokesman said that Mr Yanukovich won 49.5% of the vote, compared to 46.6% for liberal opposition challenger Viktor Yushchenko, whose supporters are continuing their mass protest over suspected vote-rigging in central Kiev's Independence Square. For three days, thousands of demonstrators have massed on the streets of the capital and other cities to denounce official results indicating Mr Yanukovich had won Sunday's presidential run-off ballot. Within minutes of the commission's announcement, some protesters began heading from their encampment on Kiev's central avenue to the presidential administration building. That building was the scene of a tense standoff last night, as protesters faced massed ranks of shield-wielding riot police. Outside the election commission, throngs of Yanukovich supporters celebrated by swigging vodka and chanting their candidate's name. No Yushchenko supporters were seen around the building, but there were fears that the two sides could eventually clash. Despite official confirmation of a Yanukovich victory, the political crisis appeared to be easing today as authorities on all sides of the disputed election today began attempts to find a compromise solution. Earlier today, Mr Yanukovich announced that the final results had to be \"legitimate\" to ensure that disputes over the outcome caused no violence. \"I will not accept the results of the presidential election until it is proved to me and the Ukrainian people that they are legitimate and credible in accordance with conditions set down by the constitution,\" he said in a statement. \"I need no fictitious victory, a result which could lead to violence and victims. No position of authority, no matter how important, is worth a single human life.\" The Russian president, Vladamir Putin, had previously congratulated Mr Yanukovich on his apparent win, but both the US and the EU said they regarded the election as deeply flawed. Today the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00bfder, said his country's close relationship with Russia would not prevent him from criticising the official election results. \"I have no questions about what the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe observer said , which was that massive electoral fraud took place in Ukraine,\" Mr Schr\u00bfder told the German parliament. The Kremlin later released a statement saying that Mr Putin and Mr Schr\u00bfder had discussed the situation by phone. \"It was noted that the post-election situation should be solved on the basis of Ukraine's existing election laws,\" the statement said. \"As far as other political problems are concerned, they could be solved through relevant political contacts and consultations.\" Mr Yushchenko also appeared more open to a compromise solution, telling a crowd of supporters that if the authorities \"find a revote necessary, we are ready\", so long as the central election commission was made up of different people. Mediators were also set to travel to Ukraine today. Lech Walesa, the founder of Poland's Solidarity movement, was intending to leave for Kiev, his son said. Mr Walesa said yesterday that he had received a letter from Mr Yushchenko seeking his help in negotiating a resolution to the crisis. The Netherlands, which holds the rotating EU presidency, also plans to send a special envoy to Ukraine. The Dutch government announced it would send former diplomat Niek Biegman to meet Mr Yanukovich, the outgoing president, Leonid Kuchma, and the parliamentary speaker, Volodymyr Lytvyn. Earlier today, the EU foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, warned of a possible outbreak of violence in Ukraine, and human rights group Amnesty International called on authorities to ensure law enforcement respected the protesters' rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. The country's defence minister, Oleksander Kuzmuk, insisted there would be no movement of troops linked to the political unrest. \"Despite all the rumours and provocative statements, I want to assure you that there have been no unplanned movements of troops or military equipment. And there will be no such movements in future,\" he said. Mr Kuchma called yesterday for negotiations involving all sides to take place. Representatives of Mr Yushchenko agreed to talks but signalled that he was not open to discussions about the result of the election. \"We are ready to negotiate only about the peaceful handing over of power to Yushchenko by Kuchma,\" said Mykola Tomenko, a MP and Yushchenko ally. Mr Yanukovich said today he saw no reason for the opposition street demonstrations taking place across the country. Speaking at a government meeting, he said: \"We [ordinary people] have all we need to be able to live normally. Nothing extraordinary is taking place.\" Mr Yushchenko dramatically declared himself the winner of Sunday's presidential election yesterday, swearing himself in after an emergency session of parliament."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
