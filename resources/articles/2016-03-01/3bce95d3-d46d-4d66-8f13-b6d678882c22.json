Throw in a capacity crowd, the first game of the exciting Easter period, and a dramatic finish to boot, and you have all the ingredients of another enthralling chapter in their rivalry. These sides have rarely served up poor games in recent years, especially since the former Leeds coach Daryl Powell assumed control at Castleford, and with this one played under the lights at their famous old Wheldon Road ground, it always promised to be something special. For Castleford this was as much a chance to get one over their local rivals as it was about answering some of their critics. Although the season is still embryonic, three defeats in a row had led some to question whether the Tigers were top-four candidates this year. A victory over a Leeds side who have only two wins from their first seven games does not completely silence those doubters, but given their significant problems with injuries this was a match to cherish for Powell\u2019s men \u2013 especially after their 56-12 defeat at Warrington. \u201cThat was probably the biggest win since I\u2019ve been at the club, just because of where we\u2019re at,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a really tough place and before the game I asked the players individually to do something special and they certainly delivered that.\u201d Leeds were admittedly without some key men, including their captain Danny McGuire, but this still seemed like another step backwards for the reigning champions, who remain two points off the foot of the table in what is becoming an increasingly worrying start to the season with a fifth defeat already. \u201cI thought we were off at the start,\u201d said the Leeds coach, Brian McDermott. \u201cAfter that I thought we gave it a real go. I don\u2019t have too much of an issue with the loss but I\u2019m encouraged we gave it some guts.\u201d As he has been for the past 12 months, Castleford\u2019s best player was the half-back Luke Gale, whose reputation was enhanced again. He played a key role in all three of their tries, the first two of which put them into a 12-0 lead. It was his pass which allowed Andy Lynch to dive over, and then the scrum-half\u2019s instinctive break freed Denny Solomona, who set up Jake Webster for the first of his two tries. Leeds led at the interval thanks to a purple patch that resulted in three tries in 14 minutes: although there was certainly an element of controversy to the final one. Joel Moon\u2019s try was backed up by Kallum Watkins finishing off Carl Ablett\u2019s charging run but Liam Sutcliffe hooked the second conversion attempt wide \u2013 something that would prove crucial. It meant Leeds trailed 12-10 but they been ahead at the interval thanks to a Tom Briscoe try that looked like it came from a forward pass. Sutcliffe again missed the conversion, and how Castleford made him and Leeds pay for his inaccuracy. In a second half largely built around drama and defence \u2013 with Zak Hardaker\u2019s outstanding last-ditch tackle on Solomona the highlight \u2013 the home side came up with the telling play eight minutes from time, when Gale sent Webster crashing over to complete another memorable match for the Tigers and their fans.
