Ms Hewitt will \"talk up\" the sector at a conference organised by the TUC, which last week warned that Britain had lost 770,000 manufacturing jobs since 1997, partly owing to a lack of support for industry. Brendan Barber, the TUC general secretary, will, however, urge the industry secretary to ensure that a greater share of the government's \u00a3110bn annual procurement budget goes to British firms in a campaign to aid manufacturing's recovery. Ms Hewitt will say: \"From some of the rhetoric around you would assume there are no jobs left in UK manufacturing but today there are 58,000 vacancies in the sector. \"That's 58,000 jobs that need filling now with skilled, enthusiastic people. But what chance do we have of filling these - of recruiting the engineers and technicians of the future - if all young people ever hear is 'doom and gloom'?\" Denying that the TUC wanted to talk down the sector, Mr Barber said manufacturing jobs fell by 12% between 1997 and 2002 in Britain but rose across the EU by 3%. Britain had the EU's lowest level of state aid for industry. \"It's not true we are advocating feather-bedding and huge subsidies for lame duck sectors with no chance of prospering,\" he told the Guardian. \"We are simply asking for British firms not to be disadvantaged against their EU competitors which get higher levels of aid. \"The government wants to reduce the level of state aid and promote competition. That's a reasonable aim but unless and until it's reached, our manufacturing should have a level playing field to compete on.\" Mr Barber said he was not urging ministers to cynically ignore EU rules but to ensure that British firms could plan ahead on the basis of being able to pitch for the greater share of the government's own procurement orders. \"It's just staggering we can have a massive investment programme like transport and we sit back and are relaxed that this will all go overseas ... We could end up being unable to build a single train to deliver that strategy.\" Derek Simpson, leader of engineering union Amicus, said successive governments' failure to invest in skills trainming was the cause of the anomaly of unfilled jobs in a shrinking sector."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
