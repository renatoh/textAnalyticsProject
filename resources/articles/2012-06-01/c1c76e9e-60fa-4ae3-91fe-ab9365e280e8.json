The title, the long takes, the few camera movements suggest Ozu, but the quiet, understated British movies of Joanna Hogg (director of Archipelago) also come to mind. All the dialogue is improvised, which gives the film a raw, honest feeling of actors digging into their shared creations but inevitably engenders a static, theatrical air."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
