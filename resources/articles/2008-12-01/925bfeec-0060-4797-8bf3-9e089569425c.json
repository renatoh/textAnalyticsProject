The leaked evidence from South African police and the British Serious Fraud Office quotes a BAE agent recommending \"financially incentivising\" politicians. In the 1999 arms deal, the new ANC government in South Africa agreed to spend \u00a31.6bn buying fleets of Hawk and Gripen warplanes. Critics said the country, beset by unemployment and HIV/Aids, could not afford it. The Hawks, rejected by the military, cost twice as much as Italian equivalents. The then South African defence minister, Joe Modise, and a key official, Chippy Shaik, insisted on the purchase. The deal was signed after a personal lobbying mission on BAE's behalf by Tony Blair, the then prime minister. It is now alleged that a series of enormous undercover cash payments from BAE were also made. BAE is accused in the reports of corrupt relationships with an arms tycoon, John Bredenkamp, recently blacklisted in the US for his links with Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. Bredenkamp's blacklisting prevents him from entering the country and freezes his accounts there. The former BAE marketing director for southern Africa, Allan McDonald, has been speaking to police, the leaked files say. He allegedly told them Bredenkamp \"gave progress reports directly to Mike Turner\". Turner, who has been interviewed under caution by the SFO, stepped down last year as BAE's chief executive. Bredenkamp-linked companies were paid \u00a340m by BAE to promote the arms deal. According to McDonald, \"Bredenkamp suggested identifying the key decision-makers, with a view to 'financially incentivising them' to make the right decision\". He said the Bredenkamp team claimed \"We can get to Chippy Shaik\". A seized memo referred to \"third world procedures\". An SFO affidavit says: \"I believe that a reference to 'third world procedures' is a veiled reference to the payment of bribes.\" Offshore financial advisers of the Thatcher family are named as potential witnesses in affidavits. A Jersey accountant, Hugh Thurston, who advised the former Conservative prime minister and her family, has given information to Serious Fraud Office investigators. He was involved, according to the police report, in setting up offshore companies for a South African politician's aide. The aide, Fana Hlongwane, was an adviser to the then defence minister, Modise. Hlongwane's cash was allegedly covertly distributed to accounts offshore and in China. Another member of the former Thatcher circle, and a potential witness, named in the files, is the businessman Sir Alan Curtis. The sometime chairman of Lotus Cars was a business associate of the late Denis Thatcher and his son Mark. A British Virgin Islands-registered, Swiss-based offshore company linked to him received \u00a38.5m, the report says, for its part in helping promote the 1999 arms contract. Curtis, at home in Farnham, Surrey, denied to the Guardian that he operated Brooklands Management, the company concerned. He said he was only involved in promoting \"social programmes and job creation\". A lengthy affidavit from the Serious Fraud Office in London, accuses BAE of \"covert\" behaviour and withholding information. The SFO principal investigator, Gary Murphy, says in the affidavit, sworn on 9 October: \"I believe that BAE have sought to conceal from the SFO the involvement of [Joe Modise aide] Fana Hlongwane \" BAE are also alleged to have drawn up an untruthful \"line\" about Hlongwane for their press office in 2003. A seized document says that if asked whether BAE had ever had any relationship with Hlongwane, they were to say: \"No, never \u2013 we knew him only as a member of the minister's entourage.\" It is alleged that in fact, the company was paying him millions of pounds through a variety of secret routes. A Swiss bank, HSBC in Geneva, has frozen $11.4m of Hlongwane accounts and sums of \u00a3400,000 and 3m euros controlled by him at Liechtenstein banks have been discovered and frozen. A letter from a Leichtenstein judge is quoted in the dossier as saying: \"It is suspected that frozen assets belonging to Hlongwane ... are linked with active and passive bribery and corruption by the company operating as BAE Systems PLC, using a system of international representatives.\" The contents of all of the documents have surfaced after being presented to a South African judge as grounds for issuing search warrants on seven premises last week. The Scorpions, the special police unit working on the case in South Africa, are facing disbandment because of political hostility to their work. This follows the closure of the SFO's inquiry in London into BAE's multimillion-pound payments to members of the Saudi royal family. Tony Blair, as prime minister, forced the SFO to call off the inquiry on the grounds of \"national security\". Bredenkamp has denied all wrongdoing. BAE would not respond to the specific allegations, but said: \"We continue to support the SFO in its enquiries, with access to people, information and premises whenever requested and wholeheartedly support a rigorous approach, in the hope that it brings to a conclusion enquiries which are now in their fifth year.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
