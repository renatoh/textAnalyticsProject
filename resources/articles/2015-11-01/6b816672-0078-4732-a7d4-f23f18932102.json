Australia is being assessed before the universal periodic review, a quadrennial assessment of countries\u2019 human rights record by the UN human rights council. One hundred and ten countries spoke at Australia\u2019s session in Geneva overnight, putting forward 300 recommendations for the country to improve its human rights record. Because of the large number of countries who wanted to comment on Australia \u2013 more than half of the countries of the UN \u2013 each nation had only 65 seconds in which to address the broad issue of Australia\u2019s human rights regime. The issue of asylum seekers dominated concerns. Indonesia \u2013 with whom relations have been strained over Australia\u2019s asylum boat turnbacks \u2013 urged Australia to \u201censure that the issues of refugees and asylum seekers are addressed in line with the principles of the Bali process and Australia\u2019s other human rights obligations\u201d. India, a country to where Australia tried to return 157 Sri Lankan asylum seekers, said Australia should review its mandatory detention policies and ensure refugees were never sent back to places where they might face persecution. And Turkey, which hosts nearly 2 million refugees, said Australia had to immediately cease transferring asylum seekers to third countries. Britain welcomed Australia\u2019s adoption of the recommendations of the Moss review into conditions on Nauru, while the US, noting Australia\u2019s historical commitment to human rights, said it was concerned by the treatment of asylum seekers. \u201cWe encourage Australia to ensure the humane treatment and respect of asylum seekers including those processed offshore in PNG and Nauru \u2026 [Australia should] closely monitor the processing of asylum seekers and refugees in offshore processing centres to ensure their human rights are respected.\u201d Even North Korea, a country with perhaps the most egregious human rights record on earth, criticised Australia: \u201cWe still have serious concerns at the continued reports of \u2026 violence against refugees and asylum seekers and violation of the human rights of Indigenous peoples in Australia.\u201d Australia sends, or is planning to send, asylum seekers and refugees to Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Cambodia and Kyrgyzstan. None of those countries spoke in Geneva. Prof Sarah Joseph, director of the Castan centre for human rights law, said Australia\u2019s treatment of asylum seekers had drawn the attention of nations from every region of the world. \u201cToday, it was manifestly clear that we are not role models on issues of asylum, we are pariahs,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Australian delegation justified the policy on the same lines as the government: stopping drownings at sea, combating people smuggling and prioritising UNHCR refugees. However, there was little indication that the international community bought these excuses.\u201d Australian efforts to improve the rights of Indigenous people, in particular the proposal for a constitutional referendum on formal recognition, were praised by a number of countries. But there were serious concerns raised about Indigenous health, education, housing and employment. Countries including Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Canada, Uruguay, Kenya and Paraguay flagged the overrepresentation of Indigenous Australians in the criminal justice system. \u201cWhile meaningful constitutional recognition is an important issue for Australia, the world recognises that we are closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians far too slowly,\u201d Joseph said. The Australian delegation said it welcomed a \u201cvigorous, wide-ranging, and balanced debate on human rights\u201d and respected the advocacy of human rights defenders. John Reid, first assistant secretary at the Attorney General\u2019s Department, said Australia remained \u201ccommitted to protecting human rights both at home and abroad\u201d but conceded that challenges remained, including the gap in key life indicators between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, and controlling irregular migration flows. \u201cAustralia\u2019s strong border protections measures have played a key role in enabling the government to maintain meaningful and significant humanitarian settlement and assistance programs,\u201d he said. \u201cSuch strong policies have also ensured public confidence in a well-managed migration program but, most importantly, Australia\u2019s measures have saved lives at sea.\u201d Tamara Lions from Amnesty International Australia said Australia\u2019s defence of its boat turnbacks policy \u2013 that it saved lives at sea \u2013 was \u201ctragically untrue\u201d. \u201cAmnesty\u2019s recent report, Deadly Journeys, shows that boats of refugees are still making dangerous journeys in our region,\u201d she said. \u201cIn May 2015, up to 8,000 people were estimated to have been stranded at sea. Over 1,100 people died in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea between the start of 2014 and mid 2015. \u201cAustralia misrepresents the problem when it says there have been no deaths \u2013 people are dying by the hundreds in seas in our region, just not in Australian waters.\u201d She added: \u201cIn the UPR session, many countries acknowledged Australia\u2019s efforts in some areas such as the NDIS [national disability insurance scheme], but they then went on to raise a raft of concerns. The international community is clearly aware of Australia\u2019s human rights failings and there is no doubt that this has affected our international reputation. \u201cAustralia has a long way to go to mend its international reputation on refugees before it can be seriously considered for a seat on the 2018 human rights council.\u201d The Human Rights Law Centre\u2019s director of advocacy and litigation, Anna Brown, said Australia\u2019s efforts to demonstrate leadership on topics such as the death penalty and the rights of older people had been overshadowed by the wave of condemnation on policies of mandatory detention, offshore processing and boat turnbacks. \u201cAustralia\u2019s potential to be a human rights leader is being completely undercut by its tremendously harsh treatment of people seeking asylum,\u201d she said. \u201cLast night at the UN there were calls from nations in every region and political grouping in the world for Australia to change its policies. \u201cAt a time when there is an unprecedented number of people around the world in need of safety, a wealthy democratic nation like Australia should be part of the solution but instead we are rightfully being condemned on the world stage for being part of the problem.\u201d She added: \u201cThe government\u2019s generally constructive and positive approach to its review last night was undermined by its one-eyed and shallow justification for its treatment of people seeking asylum. Fronting a forum like this and just repeating a tired mantra wont fool anyone \u2013 it actually just damages our international credibility.\u201d But she welcomed the federal government\u2019s \u201ccommitment to ending discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people, which will ensure that many state laws, such as those governing adoption, will be improved over the coming months\u201d. The Australia director at Human Rights Watch, Elaine Pearson, said countries \u201cfrom every corner of the globe\u201d had pressed Australia to address discrimination against Indigenous people and to safeguard the rights of refugees and asylum seekers. \u201cA number of states called on Australia to end abuses related to offshore processing and pushbacks of boats, as well as mandatory detention of asylum seekers,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s up to Australia to see if it will seriously commit to addressing these concerns. \u201cWe hope this is not a repeat of last time round, where Australia accepted a good number of recommendations but failed to implement some of them, especially on rights of asylum seekers and refugees.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
