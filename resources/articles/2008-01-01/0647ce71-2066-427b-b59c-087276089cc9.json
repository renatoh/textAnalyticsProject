The bone to nourish the meat and its liquor as it cooks, the fat to thicken and enrich the sauce or gravy. The fact that some of the bonier cuts are on the cheaper side is a bonus too good to ignore. Right now, the wish for neat lamb fillets on the grill couldn't be further from my mind. It is bone, skin and sinew all the way, a supper with plenty of body to ward off the cold. It is difficult to think of a cut that fits the bill better than the shank of lamb, the bit that sits at the lower end of the rear leg. While having more than enough meat on it, the shank is rich in sinew and bone - and for a hearty eater it's one apiece. The poor lamb shank is so subject to the ups and downs of fashion it probably thinks it's a skirt. After a good run as the darling of the gastropub circuit, this juicy little cut has slipped back into the shadows again. Too bad; few pieces of meat have so much going for them. The gastropubs braised this cut with wine and beans, occasionally lending it a smart coat of lemon and garlic gremolata. Their efforts changed the fortune of the 'lumpy bit at the end of the leg' for good. You can roast a shank, but you are taking a serious risk of a tough supper. I wouldn't do it. Far safer, I think, to let it wallow in aromatic liquid of some sort and leave it to slowly paddle its way to tenderness. There is little wrong with the remote-control seasonings of red wine, bay leaves, onions and carrots, but once you start adding root vegetables - thick winter carrots, frost-caught parsnips and golden swedes - you are introducing sweetness, too. All of which will go on, along with the gelatine in the bone, to thicken the sauce it comes with. Fresh flavours such as lemon juice and orange zest can lift the general heaviness. This week I added leeks, and beans I had soaked overnight, to my pan of simmering lamb shanks. The effect was a meal of such epic sustenance I rather wished I had spent even longer out in the cold attempting to knock the garden back into shape. The sauce was soup-like enough to eat with a spoon, but is only partly of my making. The leeks, lemon and parsley were mine, but the fat and melting goodness from the bones was all its own. As it came out of the oven, I gave it a shot of lemon juice and zest and a fistful of chopped parsley and mint that instantly brought a beige-looking supper to life. The best was yet to come. Having made twice what we needed, the rest was allowed to cool, then put into the fridge overnight. Yesterday, 48 hours after I first put the shanks in the pot, I remembered them. (I was looking for some cheese, but no matter.) Now, warmed slowly, the stew took on an even greater depth. Those sweet leeks and the bones, and their gelatinous heart, had lent the gravy a great deal of body and soul. The lamb shank has once again come out of the shadows, and it seems to get better each time it does. Braised lamb shanks with leeks and haricot beans This gets even better when left overnight in the fridge. You could make it a day or two in advance to good end. Serves 4. 4 small lamb shanks 300g dried haricot beans 4 bay leaves olive oil 4 large leeks, trimmed, halved lengthways and rinsed a thick slice of butter (about 60g) 2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely sliced 1 tbsp chopped thyme leaves 1 tbsp plain flour 650ml of light stock or water juice and zest of a lemon a handful of parsley, chopped a handful of mint leaves Soak the beans overnight in cold water. The next day, drain them, put them into a deep saucepan and cover with fresh water. Bring to the boil, skim off the froth, drop in two bay leaves and a drop or two of olive oil and simmer for 40 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave them in the cooking water. Warm a glug of olive oil in a deep casserole. Season the shanks all over with salt and black pepper then lower them into the pan. They should sizzle when they hit the oil. Turn the meat from time to time until it has coloured nicely on all sides (a pale honey rather than deep brown). Remove the meat from the casserole and set aside on a plate to catch any escaping juices. Set the oven at 160C/gas mark 4. Cut the leeks into chunks roughly the length of a wine cork; wash them thoroughly, making sure no grit or sand is trapped in their many layers, and then put them, together with the butter, in the casserole, keeping the heat low. Cover with a piece of greaseproof or bakewell paper then cover with a lid. (The paper will encourage them to cook in their own steam rather than brown.) Leave them to cook until they have started to soften - a good 20 minutes or so. You will need to give them an occasional stir. Remove and discard the paper. Peel and thinly slice the garlic, and add it to the pot with the thyme and two bay leaves. Sprinkle the flour over the top and continue cooking for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, then pour in the water or stock and the drained cooked beans. Season with salt and pepper. Return the shanks and any collected juices to the pan. Bring back to the boil. Cover the casserole with a lid and place in the oven for an hour and a half or until the lamb is completely tender - sometimes it takes two. You should be able to remove it from the bone with little effort. (Then again, it shouldn't actually be falling apart.) Remove from the oven, stir in most of the lemon juice and zest, parsley and mint, then scatter the rest over as you serve. Slow-baked rhubarb with vanilla and blood orange A sharply refreshing warm pudding for after the lamb. Serves 4. 450g rhubarb a vanilla pod the juice of 2 blood oranges and the zest of 1 3 level tbsp golden caster sugar Set the oven to 160C/gas mark 4. Cut the rhubarb into lengths roughly the size of a finger and put them into a baking dish. Scrape the seeds from inside the vanilla pod and mix with the juice and zest of one of the oranges and the juice of both. Add the sugar then pour over the rhubarb and toss gently so that each piece of fruit is wet. Roast for 30-35 minutes until soft and tender. Serve warm, in bowls, with the hot orangey-vanilla juices spooned over. nigel.slater@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
