The manager did not waver from his long established view about the importance of the domestic cups and, in the process, he set up an intriguing discussion point. Facing him at Wembley is Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, a manager who is obsessed with every piece of silverware \u2013 all the way down to the Community Shield. To Mourinho, trophies provide the validation whereas for Pochettino, it is the work and the processes which do that. Does Mourinho\u2019s approach make his players more focused, equipping them with an extra couple of percentage points, hardening their mentality to do whatever it takes to win? Or can Pochettino\u2019s more relaxed vibe offer a platform for his players to express themselves? \u201cIt would be fantastic to win the FA Cup,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cBut is it going to change our life? I don\u2019t believe so. Every one of the semi\u2011finalists will fight to win but it\u2019s not about who needs the trophy more.\u201d Tottenham have lost their previous seven FA Cup semi-finals \u2013 the most recent being the one last season against Chelsea. That defeat hurt Pochettino but he remains consumed by the pursuit of glory in the Premier League or Champions League. \u201cIf we are capable to win the Premier League and the Champions League, it is a moment you say the team has improved and reached the next level,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201c To win the FA Cup or the League Cup \u2013 it will be fantastic for the fans but it is not going to move the club to a different level. \u201cThat is my opinion. Some people respect it; some people don\u2019t. I want to play to win the Premier League and Champions League. If we can win the FA Cup, then fantastic. But if you are going to change the vision or put the club in a different level, you must compete for and then win the Premier League and Champions League. \u201cPeople in England love to talk about perception and the changing of perceptions. We had a good Champions League group stage this season \u2013 beating Dortmund and Real Madrid \u2013 and we competed very well against Juventus [in the last 16]. The dimension of the club around the world changes completely [because of that].\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
