Newlove suffered a groin injury making a left-wing break with the game already settled deep in the second half and Ian Millward, his coach, admitted: \"He's on crutches now and he had to be stretchered off, so it doesn't look good.\" After being ruled out of Saints' last Old Trafford appearance against Wigan two years ago, Newlove is now set to miss next Saturday's showdown against Bradford Bulls, a repeat of the 1999 grand final, which Saints won 8-6, and which gives them a chance of revenge after last Saturday's 28-26 defeat by the Bulls in a Knowsley Road thriller. \"I'm really happy coming off a great win like that,\" added Millward. \"I don't think there's anything between us and Bradford, but that will give us a lot of confidence.\" Wigan's coach Stuart Raper had no complaints about the result or his team's performance. \"You've got to give credit to St Helens, they were definitely the best side,\" he said. \"It's been a really tough season, but I'm proud of the guys. Looking at the way we are in that changing room right now, we'd probably struggle to field a side next week.\" Wigan had come into the game with several players carrying injuries and lost Mick Cassidy with a torn calf and Harvey Howard after a heavy knock that, according to Raper, left the big prop \"in la-la land\". He added that \"a lot of our blokes will need operations in the close season\", which must be a worry for the Great Britain coach David Waite ahead of next month's series against New Zealand. Other than Newlove, Saints came through this torrid derby relatively unscathed - although Paul Sculthorpe, their stand-off, again underlined the toughness that makes his Man of Steel title appropriate by lasting the full 80 minutes despite needing cycling shorts to protect a troublesome hamstring. It was that sort of night for Saints, time to graft rather than play with the flair for which they are famous on a filthy night with driving rain throughout the match. They thrust Wigan on to the back foot with the ferocity of their defence and the speed of their attack in the early stages, forcing enough errors to take a 10-0 lead. First Mike Bennett, a young second-row who was surprisingly promoted to the starting 13 ahead of Peter Shiels, justified his selection with a tackle that jolted the ball from Wigan's prop Craig Smith, and within a minute Sean Long was sending Tony Stewart in at the corner with a long pass that seemed to float forward. Then Adrian Lam was pressured into sending a kick into touch on the full, and this time Long followed a strong Sculthorpe drive, darted away from acting half and sent his skipper Chris Joynt plunging over. Wigan pulled back to 12-8 with two Andy Farrell goals and a stirring individual try from Cassidy. But four minutes before half-time a Farrell error - not the only one on an unhappy night for the Wigan captain - handed Saints another attacking opportunity, and Keiron Cunningham seized it with an unstoppable dummy-half run. Wigan responded by battering the Saints line for the first 10 minutes of the second half, but it held impressively, with the full-back Paul Wellens making a crucial cover tackle on Shaun Briscoe. Instead it was Wigan who cracked when Long weighted a chip kick perfectly for Sculthorpe to plunge on the loose ball and seal Saints' place at Old Trafford with 24 minutes remaining. For Newlove, though, that place is in considerable doubt. St Helens: Wellens; Albert, Gleeson, Newlove, Stewart; P Sculthorpe, Long; Britt, Cunningham, Ward, Bennett, Jonkers, Joynt.
