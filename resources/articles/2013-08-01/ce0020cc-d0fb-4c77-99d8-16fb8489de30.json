The midfielder has been battling an Achilles tendon problem that had restricted him to only two 45-minute run-outs this summer. But after coming off the bench to score a typical equaliser in the 2-1 win over Roma, while adding some verve and quality to a performance from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's side that had been seriously lacking, Lampard believes he is ready to start the new season against Hull on 18 August as well as contribute for England against Scotland on Wednesday. \"There is no pain with the injury any more. I am feeling good,\" the 35-year-old said. \"Sometimes in pre-season your shooting and timing can be a bit off, so I was pleased with the way it went in. I have worked on it in training for the past couple of weeks, so it was nice for it to come off. I like to think I am a pretty fit bloke and will be ready for Hull. \"I have trained the first week of pre-season and now the last week too, and I have trained hard. I've looked after myself in between, so if the manager wants me, I am there and I am ready.\" Lampard is set to play a limited role at Wembley but is eager to be involved. Whether he is able to heed the England manager Roy Hodgson's request to Chelsea players not to speak to Wayne Rooney about career moves while Mourinho continues to try to prise the striker away from Old Trafford remains to be seen. \"I am looking forward to joining up with England and I would love to take part at some point,\" Lampard said. \"And what a great game it is. I know people have moaned about when the game is, and that is understandable, but when you're playing against Scotland, what a fantastic game for us to play. \"It won't be a friendly, though. There will be that extra competitive edge, which is always nice. Rather than playing a side who have players you don't know too much about, there is a rivalry between us and the fans will love it too. I think it will be a good exercise \u2013 individually for fitness and collectively considering we have some important qualifiers coming up.\" On Rooney, Lampard said with a smile: \"Yeah, he is a friend of mine, so I will always chat with him.\" There certainly wasn't much to shout about in the first 45 minutes as Chelsea put in their worst display of their four-match US tour before Lampard transformed the match in Washington DC with the quality and poise their midfield had been lacking. An awful piece of control from a red-faced Mark Schwarzer had allowed Eric Lemela to give Roma a first-half lead. But a 61st-minute run and finish from Lampard allowed Chelsea back into it before Eden Hazard, who also looked sharp, set up Romelu Lukaku for the winner. Lampard added: \"The game had been a little bit slow but pre-season games can be like that. We freshened it up at half-time with some fresh legs \u2013 myself, Oscar and Ramires \u2013 so we could try and get in behind them a little bit more. \"I just tried to get on the ball as much as possible, which is what I need in terms of my personal fitness. \"There would have been no point just trotting around midfield, playing easy balls and not extending myself. I wanted to get in the box, have some shots and keep moving quickly. I am feeling good. I find it hard to put a percentage on it but what I do know is that I have trained hard all week and I am close. \"I love to contribute but I won't be putting a number on how many goals I think I'll get. Things have changed in the last couple of years but if I can still manage to chip in and be part of a successful team I will be happy.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
