Hodgson, whose side travel to Chisinau on Thursday wary of what awaits them at the Zimbru Stadium amid lingering concerns over the state of the pitch, has opted against calling up an immediate replacement but retains that option ahead of Tuesday's awkward fixture against Ukraine at Wembley. The manager has effectively now been denied nine players, including Wayne Rooney, Andy Carroll and Ashley Cole, for the match against Moldova to leave him with a squad of 21 who are due to arrive here on Thursday afternoon. Although Johnson was not certain to begin the game against a side ranked 141 in the world \u2013 he did start last month's friendly victory over Italy in Berne \u2013 his absence hinders Hodgson's options. The manager is weighing up whether to play a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 formation in Chisinau, and had been considering the various merits of the wide players in his diminished squad. Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott could compete for a place on one flank, with James Milner expected to play on the other. Johnson, fresh from his move from Manchester City to Sunderland, would have competed for a place on the right. His new club will hope his recovery is complete in time for the Premier League game against Liverpool next weekend. England have played in Chisinau only once before, for Glenn Hoddle's first game as manager in 1996, when David Beckham was handed an international debut, Paul Gascoigne scored and the visitors prevailed 3-0. That game was staged at the old Republican Stadium, which was demolished five years ago. Moldova now play their home games at the newly built Zimbru Stadium. Officials from the Football Association have twice visited the new venue as part of the buildup to the fixture and neither trip suggested there will be any potential major problems for the game. However, there is an awareness that facilities at the 10,400-capacity arena \u2013 which was built over a 27-month period at a cost of around \u00a38m and opened six years ago \u2013 are relatively basic and an acceptance that the playing surface may be far from pristine, with coaching and playing staff alike anxious to test it for themselves when the squad train on the turf at the arena on Thursday. \"We have been made aware that conditions probably won't be what we are used to, but we will see that first-hand when we train there on Thursday,\" said the centre\u2011back Gary Cahill, who had been told about England's previous visit to the country 16 years ago. \"It is going to be difficult. The conditions over there are meant to be really bad, and there are suggestions the pitch is not great. But we will see. \"We don't know much about them, to be honest, but we will spend time leading up to the game preparing, having meetings and watching footage of them. By the time we get to the game itself we will be well aware of their strengths and weaknesses, their shape and what they can do as a team. For sure, we will be well drilled for the game.\" Bangor City lost at the Zimbru Stadium in a Europa League qualifier against Zimbru Chisinau in July and their club secretary, Gwynfor Jones, said: \"The surface was OK but it is certainly not Premier League standard. We play on a lot worse in the Welsh Premier League but it will not be what the England players are used to. I'd say it's the sort of standard you might find in the Championship or League One. \"The stadium is small and the crowd are close to the pitch. There were only a couple of thousand inside for our game but it was quite intimidating and very noisy and the Moldovan fans were fighting with each other.\" Moldova, one of the poorest countries in Europe, are ranked and 48th out of 53 in Europe \u2013 England are still ranked third in the standings announced by Fifa on Wednesday \u2013 to suggest Roy Hodgson's side should have the clout to prevail. Indeed, Ion Caras's team have failed to score a goal in 2012. Yet they proved stubborn opponents during the qualifying campaign for Euro 2012, losing only narrowly home and away to Holland and beating Finland at home. \"There are a lot of factors when you go to a place like Moldova,\" Hodgson said last week. \"We have to come to terms with what the stadium is going to be like, what the atmosphere is going to be like, what the pitch is going to be like, as well as how good these players are. \"I know that, outside our little group, there will be a lot of thought that Moldova are not very special, not very strong, but we certainly don't go into the game with that thought at all. \"We go into the game knowing they had narrow defeats against Holland in the last qualifying campaign. If we are not aware of the fact this is a major hurdle of the 10 we have to jump then we would be very, very foolish.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
