The family of Edith Hunt, who is not a regular churchgoer, said that they were appalled when they opened the request, which added that \"antique jewellery, oil paintings or even a Victorian sideboard\" could make helpful legacies for the church. The printed letter and leaflet from the Right Rev John Packer, Bishop of Ripon and Leeds, arrived just after Mrs Hunt had been re-admitted to hospital after breaking her hip. She had only recently been discharged after heart tests at St James's University hospital in the city, where a chaplain had spoken to her about having trust in God. A spokesman for the bishop said that the leaflet and letter were a standard invitation to consider making a bequest, \"intended for those with a connection to the cathedral who may appreciate the opportunity to leave something to this ancient and historic building\". He added: \"We very much regret that the letter was sent to Mrs Hunt in error and we would wish to apologise wholeheartedly for any distress caused to her family.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
