Some of the biggest stars of the showbiz world turned up for the awards, hosted by presenter Chris Evans at London's Earls Court. Williams' Angels beat songs by Will Young, Queen, Kate Bush and Joy Division in a vote by BBC Radio 2 listeners. Franz Ferdinand, who were up for five awards, were announced as winners of the best British rock category. The Glasgow four-piece played their first gig to 40 people in Glasgow in May 2002. Alex Kapranos said: \"We've had a smashing time and we think it's time for someone else to have a go.\" Keane won the award for best British breakthrough act over Franz Ferdinand, Joss Stone, Natasha Bedingfield and the Zutons. Muse, who hit the scene for the first time in 1999 won best British live act, while the Scissor Sisters, who opened the show with a performance of their hit Take Your Mama, beat Jet Kanye West, Killers and Maroon 5 to the award for International Breakthrough Act. Singer Jake Shears thanked his parents, the record label \"for taking a gamble on us\" and the British people, saying: \"It's been the best year of our lives.\" Williams looked extremely anxious when Evans said his former Take That band mates Gary Barlow and Howard Donald were presenting his awards. To his relief, it was Little Britain's Matt Lucas and David Walliams dressed up as the former band mates. Williams said: \"Sorry Gary, I was always the talented man of the band.\" And borrowing a line from an old Take That song, he joked: \"Whatever I said, whatever I did, I didn't mean it. I just want you back for good.\" Tonight is Williams' 15th Brit awards. He said: \"I'm just amazed that my career keeps going.\" And he joked: \"I would just like to thank my boyfriend, Jake, from the Scissor Sisters, and Chris, it's great to see you back on stage.\" Full list of winners"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
