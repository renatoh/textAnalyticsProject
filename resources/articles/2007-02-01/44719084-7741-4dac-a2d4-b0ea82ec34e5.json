Ever since Ruth canoodled with Sam, the cowman, in The Archers (Radio 4) her husband, David, has frozen her out. As canoodles go, it was comparatively chaste, but David took it very badly and has moped for months. Bears with sore heads would have whistled. Mules could have taken his correspondence course. Sir Edward would have raised his hat to him. He has spent his evenings in the toolshed, grinding his teeth, or at the computer, updating the poisons book. An ominous occupation for a jealous husband. Never talkative, he is now taciturn and what he does say is virtually incomprehensible: \"I don't hold out much hope for the bowser.\" (Discuss the future, if any, of the bowser. If none, forget it.) This month, like Ruth, David found another love. She is a 40-year-old Massey Ferguson tractor, bright scarlet and slightly battered, but catnip to the chaps. I think of her as Fergie. There seems a resemblance. David is shamelessly smitten: \"When I saw it I simply had to have it. I can't wait to get stuck in.\" Ruth is resigned: \"He disappears into the workshop, tinkering with his tractor.\" Every night is spent with Fergie, stripping her down. Well, really! To the cold eye of common sense, the old girl is showing her age. \"The back end's had a lot of wear . . . there's rust on the steering arm . . . we've got to replace the seat.\" I am not unsympathetic. My own back end's had a lot of wear and, if I thought medical science were up to the challenge, I'd have my seat replaced, too, but I'd probably keep quiet about it. To David, however, Fergie's wear and tear, her leaks and creaks are the essence of her charm. I am reminded of Agatha Christie, who was married to an archaeologist. She thoroughly recommended it. The older you got, the more interested he was in you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
