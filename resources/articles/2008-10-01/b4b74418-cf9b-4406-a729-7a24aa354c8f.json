Adewale has been a welcome presence on the UK scene for years, playing with Monica Vasconcelos, Antonio Forcione (who guests on Encanto) and Jonathan Priess, of samba/choro group Caratinga. Sementes (Seeds) resists easy categorisation. Kadialy Kouyate's measured kora parts give the ensemble a timeless, West African slant, while Nathan Riki Thomson's bass adds contemporary, nu-jazz suppleness. The shrill winds of Comboio somehow link north-eastern Brazil with Eastern Europe. Adewale's compositions are simple but uncliched, featuring different percussive combinations on nearly every track. It's beautifully recorded, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
