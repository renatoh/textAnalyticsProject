Birmingham were relieved to end a run of six successive defeats against their neighbours Aston Villa with a goalless draw at Villa Park, although Alex McLeish's team could have been forgiven for wondering whether the outcome may have been even better had Webb come down harder on Nigel Reo-Coker on two occasions. Birmingham had good claims for a penalty in the first half, when the ball struck Reo-Coker's arm, and were also entitled to question whether Webb should have sent off the Villa captain later in the game, when the midfielder aimed a kick at Craig Gardner's backside in an act of retaliation but escaped with only a booking. Carr, however, refused to criticise Webb, insisting the World Cup final referee got both decisions right and deserved praise for the way in which he handled a fixture in which tempers have often boiled over. \"I thought it was quite a well-tempered game,\" the Birmingham captain said, when asked about the skirmish involving Reo-Coker and Gardner late on. \"The referee did brilliantly, he got hold of it. There was nothing nasty in it. The lads behaved themselves.\" Carr, who said he enjoyed receiving stick from the Villa supporters after he was targeted in the wake of making an obscene gesture towards them last season, was just as magnanimous when it came to Webb's decision to turn down strong appeals for a Birmingham penalty after Reo-Coker's handball. \"The ref thought it was more ball to hand. He wasn't 100%. If you are not 100% you can't make the decision. It was not a stone-wall penalty.\" The draw on Sunday keeps Birmingham within touching distance of Villa in the Premier League table, and Carr believes there is now little to choose between the two clubs on the pitch. \"I don't think we are a million miles away but obviously they might have bit more clout financially. Last season we could have won it and this season we could have won it. We went quite positive and passed the ball well. There are a lot of good things to take from it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
