The institutional investor", "bodyText": "Job: causing trouble for company chairmen and chief executives Industry: City Salary: a lot 2003 ranking: new entry What do Michael Green, Piers Morgan, Tom Glocer and Sir Martin Sorrell have in common? Apart, that is, from probably not claiming bus tickets on their expenses. They have all been victims of shareholder revolts. Some, like WPP chief executive Sir Martin and Reuters boss Tom Glocer, survived. Morgan and Mr Green weren't quite so lucky. Mr Green, the chairman designate of ITV plc, was ousted by a revolt led by Fidelity fund manager Anthony Bolton, famously dubbed the \"quiet assassin\". Mr Bolton is also said to be behind efforts to oust ITV chief executive Charles Allen, with Greg Dyke a possible replacement. But Mr Bolton is only one of many fund managers to make their presence felt, hence the appearance of the anonymous \"institutional investor\" in the final place of this year's MediaGuardian 100. It is particularly apt because that is how most of them remain - anonymous. Morgan was sacked as Mirror editor after Trinity Mirror boss Sly Bailey came under pressure from investors over the fake photos of Iraqi prisoner abuse, while Reuters chief executive Mr Glocer ditched a controversial two-year pay deal in the face of shareholder anger. Rupert Murdoch and Disney boss Michael Eisner have also faced the wrath of investors over the last 12 months. Indeed, shareholders have been accused of meddling too much and trying to \"micromanage\" firms. But the government has actively encouraged shareholder power in a bid to curb excessive management pay packets. With Mr Green picking up a \u00a315m payoff from Carlton, Tony Ball walking away from Sky with \u00a311m, and Sir Martin set to net up to \u00a344m over the next five-year period, they appear to have some way to go just yet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
