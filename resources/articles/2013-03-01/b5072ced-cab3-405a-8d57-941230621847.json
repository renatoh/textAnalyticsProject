So the annual Reykjavik Open, despite its modest \u20ac15,000 prize fund, always attracts a competitive grandmaster entry where top players from the United States, Western Europe, Russia and Asia jostle for supremacy. On the rest day many of the players went on Iceland's Golden Circle tour of the island's beauty spots, but with a difference: the final stop on the tour was Fischer's grave at Selfoss. Fischer played his 'Game of the Century' at 13 and another 13-year-old stole the show this week at Reykjavik. China's Wei Yi became the youngest GM in the world and the fourth youngest ever when he beat France's No1, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, and finished tied fourth on 8/10, level with the British champion, Gawain Jones, who went through unbeaten. Wei Yi, remember that name. It could prove a portent for the future of chess. China already dominates the women's game and is now pouring resources into stepping up its efforts to achieve comparable results with teenage male talents. A little-known Scot made his mark in the early rounds. Hamilton's Andrew Muir, an amateur and journeyman master, had the purple patch of his life when he defeated two highly ranked GMs in succession. The first game was bizarre as his Egyptian opponent blundered a rook and resigned after 19 moves while in the second Muir missed a brilliancy featured in this week's puzzle. Egypt's No1 GM blundered badly by 17 Nxe5? when 17 Ng5+ or 17 Nh4 keeps a slight edge. Bassem Amin saw too late that his planned 19 Be4 to trap the queen fails to Qxe4! 20 dxe4 Nf3+ when White's own queen is lost. White looks an idiot here but Amin later recovered so well that he ended up tied first. Bassem Amin v Andrew Muir 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 g3 g6 4 Bg2 Bg7 5 O-O d6 6 c3 e5 7 d3 Nge7 8 Be3 O-O 9 Nh4 Be6 10 Nd2 Qd7 11 f4 Rac8 12 Ndf3 h6 13 Qd2 Kh7 14 f5 gxf5 15 exf5 Nxf5 16 Nxf5 Bxf5 17 Nxe5?? Nxe5 18 Rxf5 Qxf5 19 Rf1 Qe6 0-1 France's No1 tried to blow Wei Yi off the board but the 13-year-old coolly refuted the attack and cashed in his extra material. At the end Qf1+ 34 Kg3 with Qe3+ forces mate.
