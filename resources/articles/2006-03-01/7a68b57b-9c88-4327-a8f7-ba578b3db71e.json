Four-year-old Guinevere escaped from the Tropical Wings World of Wildlife in South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, on Saturday. Despite her 5ft wing span she was harried as she tried to rest on rooftops and trees. But a team of handlers failed to woo her back. \"I'm afraid this could go on for some time,\" said Lucy Murray, conservation manager at the wildlife centre. She said the bird ate only carrion and would not attack pets or people."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
