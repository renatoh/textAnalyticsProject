We will be spending a further fortnight scuba-diving from the island of Matamanoa in Fiji and Western Samoa. We are aware that this is the rainy season out there but it is also cyclone season. All the tourist boards in those regions have said that it's fine to come at that time of year but we'd like to know if anyone has had first-hand experience of these cyclones. Would we be wiser to go there during a different month? Jacqueline Russell"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
