He lives in the future instead. \u201cI get a real buzz when I ride a nice horse in a novice that I think could be the next star,\u201d Murphy said here on Friday, shortly after riding his 38th winner of the season. \u201cThat can keep you going when you\u2019re not riding winners or things have gone wrong. \u201cWhen you think you\u2019ve found one, in the morning or at the races, a potential star in your own mind, that can give you a lift for a week. It\u2019s nearly bigger than riding a huge winner because you\u2019re dreaming about where this horse could take you. When you\u2019re living in the future, it\u2019s less hard work.\u201d Right now, it is a future which could scarcely be brighter. Murphy has flung himself into his challenge for the championship, riding more horses than any other jockey this year and, after Friday afternoon\u2019s action, eight more winners than any of his rivals too. He has had 11 winners from 32 rides since the start of June and is in such demand that his 11 leading money-earners this year are all in different stables. It might be enough to turn the head of some 23-year-olds, not least on the back of a 2018 season in which he rode nine Group One winners. Murphy, though, is refreshingly unaffected by his success and his status as favourite to beat Silvestre de Sousa to the title, giving much of the credit to the horses and his supporters. \u201cLots of people are flying at the moment so it\u2019s very important if I\u2019ve got any chance in the championship that I\u2019m converting the winners when I\u2019m getting the opportunities,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cAll this week, I\u2019ve been going racing for winning chances and thankfully we\u2019ve been able to convert some of them. \u201cThat goes to show how hard my agent\u2019s working and how fortunate I am to have so many good people behind me. The bottom line is you\u2019re only as good the horses you\u2019re getting on and without getting on these horses, I can\u2019t ride the winners. \u201cSo there\u2019s no place for arrogance or complacency in the weighing room because it\u2019s obvious to see what can happen when that mindset strikes. The results can suddenly go downhill.\u201d Perhaps because of his head-down devotion to the task in hand, Murphy still has a relatively low profile among the wider sporting public. But here too, the future looks bright. Royal Ascot begins in less than a fortnight and Murphy expects to have his strongest ever book of rides at Flat racing\u2019s most glamorous meeting. His rides in the races for two-year-olds look particularly strong as Murphy tries to add to his single winner at the Royal meeting in each of the last two seasons. Lambeth Walk and Exclusively, both trained by Archie Watson, and Joseph O\u2019Brien\u2019s Air Force Jet are all expected to set off at, or close to, the head of the market. \u201cFor any jockey to get one winner in the week is a huge relief and a massive result,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just very important in your mind as much as anything else. From a confidence point of view, it can carry you the whole way through Glorious Goodwood and the Ebor meeting, just on the back of a decent winner at Ascot.\u201d And after Ascot, it will be back to the graft that will be required to win a title. \u201cI don\u2019t really go anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cI live in Lambourn, so everyone knows me there, and after that, I live riding out, or at the races, or in my car or on planes on Sundays to France and Germany. So I don\u2019t really socialise that much with people and I\u2019ve got the same circle of friends that I\u2019ve had since I was an apprentice, so that hasn\u2019t changed much. But it\u2019s only denial if you admit it to yourself. You need to keep chipping away.\u201d Punters short-changed by Hamilton stalls swap When is a race so far removed from what was billed that it is a different race entirely? The question occurs after watching several contests on Thursday evening, all of which involved important departures from the script presented to punters on the racecard. Four of these races were at Ffos Las\u2019s evening meeting, where the sun came out and the decision was taken to omit the two flights in the home straight in the last four races on the card. This meant that in the two scheduled contests over two miles, the field galloped the length of the home straight and around the bend, jumped four flights down the back and then had a run-in from the final flight of well over half a mile. Two more races, over around two-and-a-half miles, also lost four hurdles each. If there is a lesson to be learned here, it may well be that it is not the greatest of ideas to schedule a jumps meeting for an evening in early June when half of the obstacles will need to be removed if the sun comes out. But these were not the only races on Thursday that did not take place as planned. In the last race at Hamilton two of the runners swapped stalls. Samovar, who had been due to start from stall seven, went into box 12 instead and went on to finish second, while Gift In Time went into seven and finished unplaced. In this particular case, Samovar outran his odds of 14-1 to finish a close second on a part of the track which had seemed less favourable earlier in the afternoon. Had he been able to race down the centre, as might well have been the case from his proper stall, Samovar could well have been the winner. No one can be sure, of course, but anyone who backed Samovar has every right to feel that they did not get a fair run for their money. And if punters are left feeling cheated through no fault of their own, it does seem to add insult to injury as the stewards deemed it worthy of no more than a one-day suspension form the joekcys who took their mounts into the wrong stalls."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
