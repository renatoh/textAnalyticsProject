After meeting with his top national security officials to discuss Wednesday night\u2019s downing of a Global Hawk spy drone, the president declared: \u201cI would imagine it was a general or somebody that made a mistake in shooting that drone down. \u201cI find it hard to believe it was intentional if you want to know the truth. I think it could have been somebody who was loose and stupid that did it,\u201d Trump told journalists. \u201cIt was a very foolish move.\u201d Trump reinforced the administration\u2019s red line that it would respond militarily if Iranian forces or proxies harm Americans \u2013 but stressed that was not the case on this occasion. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a man or woman in the drone. It would have made a big, big difference,\u201d Trump said. Asked how the US would respond, he said: \u201cYou\u2019ll find out.\u201d Late on Thursday, the New York Times said Trump had initially approved attacks on a handful of Iranian targets, including radar and missile batteries, before pulling back. Citing officials, the paper said the operation was in its early stages and planes were in the air before it was called off. Later, Iran\u2019s foreign minister and the US military offered competing graphics showing the drone\u2019s flight path and where it was brought down. Javad Zarif said Iran had recovered parts of the drone in its waters and that it had originally taken off from the United Arab Emirates. A map issued by US Central Command suggested the drone was brought down in international waters in the Strait of Hormuz. On Thursday night, Democratic congressional leaders urged Trump to work with US allies. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said the administration should \u201cdo everything in our power to de-escalate\u201d, while Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he worried the administration \u201cmay bumble into a war\u201d. He said he told the president during a classified briefing there must be a \u201crobust, open debate\u201d and Congress should have a real say. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, said: \u201cThe president certainly listened to what we had to say.\u201d Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, said: \u201cThe administration is engaged in what I called measured responses.\u201d Political support for the administration\u2019s Middle East policies is shaky. On Thursday, the Senate voted against the White House\u2019s use of an emergency declaration to sell $8bn to its allies in the Gulf without congressional approval. His critics are unlikely to muster enough senators to overturn the expected presidential veto, but Thursday\u2019s vote was a measure of unease over Trump\u2019s close relationship with the Saudi monarchy. Trump said he was sticking to his promise to extract the US from wars in the Middle East, adding: \u201cBut this is a new wrinkle, a new fly in the ointment what happened, shooting down a drone. And this country will not stand for it, that I can tell you.\u201d Iranian officials have said that the shooting down was a deliberate act and a success of the country\u2019s security forces, but claimed that the aircraft was over Iranian territory. The Iranian ambassador to the UN, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, claimed the aircraft was \u201cin stealth mode as it had turned off its identification equipment and engaged in a clear spying operation\u201d. \u201cWhen the aircraft was returning towards the western parts of the region near the strait of Hormuz, despite repeated radio warnings, it entered into the Iranian airspace,\u201d Ravanchi said in a letter to UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. \u201cThe downing of the American drone was a clear message to America \u2026 our borders are Iran\u2019s red line and we will react strongly against any aggression \u2026 Iran is not seeking war with any country, but we are fully prepared to defend Iran,\u201d the IRGC commander, Hossein Salami, said, according to Iranian media. Trump insisted that the Global Hawk drone was over international waters, saying: \u201cWe have it all documented scientifically, not just words.\u201d The US military said the use of a high-powered anti-aircraft missile against a target in international airspace was a danger to commercial airliners in the region. \u201cThis was an unprovoked attack on a US surveillance asset that had not violated Iranian airspace at any time during its mission,\u201d Gen Joseph Guastella, US Central Command\u2019s top air force commander, told reporters. \u201cThis attack is an attempt to disrupt our ability to monitor the area following recent threats to international shipping and the free flow of commerce,\u201d Guastella said. \u201cThe aircraft was over the strait of Hormuz and fell into international waters.\u201d US officials confirmed the downed aircraft was a US navy Global Hawk surveillance drone, which had been hit by an Iranian surface-to-air missile over the strait of Hormuz at 11.35pm GMT. The $130m (\u00a3102m) Global Hawk is the world\u2019s largest surveillance drone, packed with sophisticated electronics and the size of a small commercial airliner. Iranian forces and allied militias had previously fired at and brought down US Reaper drones, but this is the biggest US target Iran has hit to date, as tensions in the region escalate. Close to the same time as the drone was shot down, Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are backed by Iran, hit a Saudi desalination plant with an apparently sophisticated missile, and there have been a string of rocket and mortar attacks on or close to US facilities in Iraq. On Wednesday the Pentagon confirmed it was sending an additional 1,000 troops to the Gulf in response to two attacks on commercial tankers on 13 June which the US has blamed on Iran\u2019s IRGC. Trump downplayed the tanker attacks as \u201cvery minor\u201d but US officials have made clear to Iran that it would view an attack on its forces by Iran or proxy militias as a threshold for a military response. Iran said the US drone was shot down by the \u201c3rd Khordad\u201d air defence system, which is an Iranian equivalent to the Russian Buk system that downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014. The use of such weapons in an area of crowded skies has underlined the dangers of the standoff in the Gulf spinning out of control. The secretary of Iran\u2019s supreme national security council, Ali Shamkhani, had said on Wednesday that Tehran would respond to any intrusion into its airspace or waters. Shamkhani emphasised that Iran robustly protects its aerial and maritime borders, describing its airspace as the country\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d. \u201cNo matter whose plane trespasses into it, we have always given and will give a harsh response to intruders.\u201d Speaking in London, the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said: \u201cThe international community is determined to push back against Iran\u2019s aggressive behaviour.\u201d Saying steps were being prepared to protect shipping in the Gulf, he added: \u201cFreedom of navigation is essential to global security and the world economy. Any attempt to close the strait of Hormuz will provoke a very strong reaction.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
