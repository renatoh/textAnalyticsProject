She got to the assessment stage of Teach First, a scheme that places graduates in challenging schools, but wasn't successful. She is currently doing an unpaid internship at a PR company. Some students I know have said there is no point trying to get a graduate job this year \u2013 quite a lot of people just say they're going to work in a restaurant or a shop for six months and then go travelling instead. They feel they may as well have another year doing something that's still productive, but is quite enjoyable too, because it will be pretty depressing trying to find a job and living at home with their parents. Everyone I know has been very wary about the process. We're all resigned to the fact that there's going to have to be a few months, even a year, when the best thing you can do is get your CV up to scratch doing unpaid work. I'd rather be doing a paid job, but in the industry I want to go into \u2013 arts and culture \u2013 I don't think there's really anything going at the moment. I've signed up for lots of websites and recruitment agencies, but there's nothing that fits what I want to do \u2013 just administrative jobs and call centres. The only way to get into this industry at the moment is to get an internship or work experience. But I'm lucky enough to be able to borrow money from my parents and live at home. Obviously not everyone can do that, so unpaid internships aren't possible for everyone. I have been offered another internship after this one and I'm aiming to get a job by the end of the year. All the news about cuts does worry me, and makes me think it's going to be even harder now. But I have always been passionate about what I want to do, and you don't want to settle for something you are not completely motivated about. It is disheartening doing it like this. After four years at university, where you enjoy yourself but work really hard as well, most people would have previously imagined that when they get a degree, they should be OK getting a job. But for the last couple of years we haven't really thought like that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
