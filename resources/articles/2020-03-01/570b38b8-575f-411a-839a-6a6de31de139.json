Scott Morrison\u2019s office called the ABC\u2019s news boss, Gaven Morris, last week suggesting Swan should speak to Murphy. Sources say the prime minister\u2019s office was concerned Swan\u2019s advice was contrary to that of Murphy\u2019s. Swan\u2019s forthright views on the initial response to the coronavirus outbreak, which he said must have \u201creally annoyed\u201d the government, have since been the subject of a flurry of attacks from News Corp columnists. Swan had been pushing for the government to close the schools, conduct more testing and move faster on encouraging social distancing. \u201cTest a lot, isolate, find all contacts if you can and isolate them,\u201d Swan, who trained as a medical practitioner, said on social media early last week. \u201cStop mass mingling. Bring the public with you. Young people as well as the elderly will die unnecessarily if we don\u2019t act. Today\u2019s cases are the result of what we didn\u2019t do two weeks ago.\u201d Swan, who appeared on Q+A on Monday, is a regular on 7.30 and RN Breakfast, as well as his own Radio National show, the Health Report. His new wildly popular Coronacast podcast with Tegan Taylor, which answers questions submitted by the public, is number one on Apple podcasts. Swan said he was not cowed by the government\u2019s irritation at his commentary, and ABC management was highly supportive. \u201cI am not going to comment on any call that may or may not have taken place between me and a senior manager of the ABC,\u201d Swan told Guardian Australia. \u201cI can only surmise that I really annoyed them during the week of the football fiasco, when the prime minister wanted to go to the football, and they perceived me as having talked about closing the Grand Prix down.\u201d The Australian\u2019s columnists Gerard Henderson and Chris Kenny, both frequent ABC critics, lined up to pour scorn on Swan\u2019s efforts last week. Henderson wrote that Swan \u201cput in a claim to provide alternative medical advice\u201d and should back off because he was not an expert in infection control. Henderson also appeared on Sky News telling Andrew Bolt, another Swan critic, that the ABC health journalist was confusing the message. On Monday Kenny devoted a column to attacking Swan, accusing him of grandstanding for attention and profiting from his vast media exposure. \u201cNo matter how many people become infected or die, he won\u2019t carry any burden of responsibility and, even better, he will always be able to say he advocated tougher measures,\u201d Kenny wrote. Swan said he wouldn\u2019t be doing his duty as a journalist if he was to \u201chold back on analysis which I thought would help people make decisions\u201d. \u201cMy role as a broadcast journalist is to analyse information and pass it on to the community,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also as a journalist to hold governments to account.\u201d Swan was also critical of cabinet not self-isolating after its exposure to Peter Dutton, who tested positive to Covid-19, and for Morrison\u2019s original plan to attend the football. \u201cThere was mixed messages from the government [earlier in the month],\u201d Swan said. \u201cI\u2019m in the unfortunate position of having walked into an information vacuum. \u201cThere was inconsistent information. I think the government thought they were communicating well, but the community thought otherwise.\u201d Swan said he had had an \u201cincredibly friendly and affable\u201d chat with Murphy. \u201cThere was no rancour and no discussion about my role or what I\u2019ve been saying.\u201d Swan said the response to the Coronacast podcast \u2013 24,000 questions to date \u2013 had made him realise there was \u201cprofound anxiety\u201d in the community. \u201cPeople were finding it hard to find spokespeople who would tell it straight \u2013 which is a bit unfair on the spokespeople \u2013 and I filled that gap. He has softened his attitude towards the official line, which he said had become much more consistent. \u201cLast week the government improved the messaging, they brought that national leadership group together, they stabilised,\u201d Swan says. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with their messaging, but it\u2019s become much more coherent.\u201d He dismissed calls on social media for him to replace the CMO. \u201cWe have to get rid of the mushroom cloud of Twitter and social media and all that crap and get down to focusing on the business, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI was getting anxious because I was moving so fast and I was scared I\u2019d make a mistake. I\u2019ve made two small errors which I\u2019ve corrected on air.\u201d He has rationalised his media appearances, and is concentrating on his main gigs as well as 7.30 and RN Breakfast. The prime minister\u2019s office declined to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
