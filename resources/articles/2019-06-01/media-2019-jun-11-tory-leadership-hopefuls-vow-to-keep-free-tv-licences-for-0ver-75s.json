Tory leadership hopefuls Sajid Javid and Andrea Leadsom became the latest to speak out on the issue, following the BBC\u2019s announcement on Monday that most older viewers would have to start paying the \u00a3154.50 fee from next year. Esther McVey had already said on Monday she was \u201cashamed\u201d of the BBC\u2019s decision, implying the corporation should instead make deep spending cuts of about \u00a3750m a year. The 2017 Conservative manifesto contained a pledge to maintain the benefit, even though the party later suggested this was a mistake made as a result of a copy-and-paste error. Older Britons overwhelmingly voted Conservative at the last general election and are overrepresented among the Tory members who will chose the next prime minister. Leadsom, the former leader of the Commons, said on Tuesday she would honour the commitment to protect the subsidy. \u201cI think that\u2019s unacceptable. It\u2019s a commitment in the Conservatives\u2019 manifesto and we need to find a way to reverse that.\u201d Aides to Javid told the Guardian the home secretary would also seek to ensure the subsidy continued. \u201cIf elected prime minister, he would absolutely work with the BBC to find a way to deliver the manifesto commitment,\u201d he said. However, neither gave any details on how the cost of providing the free licences would be met, suggesting it could involve loading the cost on to the BBC during a future funding agreement. McVey said on Monday: \u201cAs someone who used to work for the BBC I am ashamed of them for this decision. Our \u2018public service broadcaster\u2019 who has forgotten the public they are supposed to serve.\u201d She added: \u201cMy aim is to make sure that the BBC do not benefit financially from breaking their promise and I would want to do everything we can to ensure that all over-75s get the free TV licences they deserve.\u201d Free licence fees for the over-75s were brought in by Gordon Brown in 1999, with the cost paid for out of taxation central government. In 2015, the chancellor, George Osborne, struck a deal with the BBC in which the broadcaster shouldered the cost itself, later transferring responsibility for the politically toxic decision on who should receive the benefit to the broadcaster. The BBC has said it would face \u201cunprecedented closures\u201d if it did not make the changes and pointed out that many elderly individuals were much wealthier than when the benefit was introduced. About 3m households will have to start paying the licence fee on pain of prosecution. Conservative MPs expressed their dissent in the Commons on Tuesday, after Labour\u2019s Tom Watson put forward an urgent question on the matter. The shadow culture secretary pointed out that more than 4,000 elderly individuals would lose the benefit in Boris Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge constituency, suggesting he \u201cwants to give a tax cut to the very richest, but he will not lift a finger to defend pensioners\u201d. The Conservative MP William Wragg said the Tories had been \u201cquite categoric\u201d about protecting free licences in their manifesto. Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper accused him of \u201ccareering round the country\u201d promising tax cuts for the wealthy while taking from vulnerable pensioners, adding: \u201cOn what planet is that fair?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
