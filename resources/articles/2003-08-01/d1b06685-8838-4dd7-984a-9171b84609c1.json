The Scots, lacking flair and inspiration, failed miserably to make home advantage pay in the first leg of this third qualifying round against a strong Danish side and, to make matters worse, they conceded an all-important away goal. Still the Rangers manager Alex McLeish refused to be downhearted. \"The only thing I can say about this is that the tie is still alive and we have players who can score over there,\" he said. \"It will be difficult but the challenge is there for them to provide the performance that will take us through.\" It all started so well for the home side when they were presented with agoal. With only seven minutes on the clock Erik Mykland fouled Mikel Arteta, his free-kick was fumbled by Copenhagen's goalkeeper Balazs Raboczki and Peter Lovenkrands was on hand to fire home. But the Danes regrouped to good effect. Sibusiso Zuma was their chief threat and forced Stefan Klos into one decent save just before the half-hour and an even better one five minutes later. Just before that Rangers created and missed an outstanding chance when Craig Moore met an Arteta corner but Michael Mols's shot hit Raboczki from two yards. When the interval came the Scottish champions were grateful for that early breakthrough in what had proved to be a difficult 45 minutes. Rangers were given a stern warning just after the break when Zuma fired wide. But they failed to take heed and paid the penalty after 51 minutes. There was little initial danger but a shot from Bo Norregaard deflected off Zura Khizanishvili straight into the path of Todi Jonsson. He turned quickly and sent a fine low drive flashing past Klos. Rangers took some time to rediscover their composure and on the hour Maurice Ross was replaced by Nuno Capucho as McLeish tried to boost his attacking options. But the Danes kept control to complete a frustrating night for Rangers. Rangers (4-3-3): Klos; Ross (Capucho, 60), Moore, Khizanishvili, Ball; Ricksen, Ferguson, Arteta; De Boer (Thompson, 70), Mols, Lovenkrands. Booked: Ferguson. FC Copenhagen (4-4-2): Raboczki; Tobiasen, Svensson, Albrechtsen, Rooba; Norregaard, Nielsen, Mykland, Larsen; Zuma, Jonsson (Moller, 75). Booked: Larsen.
