He is also right to emphasise the need to confront the \"evil ideology\" behind contemporary terrorism. For these reasons, new anti-terror legislation (Letters, July 19) and Blair's meeting with Muslim leaders both miss the point. Contemporary terrorism is a product of de-politicisation and the hollowing out of political institutions. As a result, a largely hidden anger pervades this country. While the forms it takes vary, it cuts across boundaries of creed, generation and race. To address this we do need to engage in the \"ideological struggles\" of which Blair talks. But his talk rings hollow coming from a government that has systematically undermined many of the most inspiring values Britons held in common. We need fewer grand but empty gestures. And fewer pleas for us to have faith in our leader's conscience, and more well-informed and reasoned arguments. Nico Macdonald London As someone with vivid memories of 1968 - I was at Grosvenor Square, and went to Paris during the May events - I was struck by a sentence in Martin Kettle's article about the Baader-Meinhof group (Useful idiots have always apologised for terrorists, July 19): \"violence was widespread, not just in the form of American bombing of Vietnam, but in the tactics adopted ... by significant parts of the counter-culture\". The American violence in Vietnam (and Cambodia) in terms of scale (more bombs dropped than in the second world war, 3 million Vietnamese and 57,000 US soldiers killed) utterly eclipsed the violence not just of Baader-Meinhof, but of all the \"terrorist\" groups - all the Red Brigades, IRAs, jihadis, al-Qaidas etc - of the past hundred years put together. The only thing that obscures this obvious fact is the persistent tendency to regard deaths of people like \"us\" (white Europeans) as more significant than deaths of \"them\" (Asians, Arabs etc). The parallels with Iraq and Afghanistan are clear. John Molyneux Southsea, Hants Martin Kettle writes that we face an enemy with \"a romantic attachment to violence\". True, but part of the problem is that our leaders, in particular Bush and Blair, have an equally romantic attachment to violence - the idea that all that is necessary to solve the problems of a country is to invade it, occupy it and kill or imprison the \"evil-doers\". Iraq and the determination shown by Londoners since the attacks show that no matter how noble the ends one is aiming at, violence as a means is liable to produce the opposite effect. Joe Morison London It is unclear in Martin Kettle's article who was \"re-embracing\" which \"tradition of violence\" in May 1968. We are to assume from his Burkean claim that \"violence\", as opposed to, say, the Enlightenment, \"was not just an aspect of the French revolution, but its motor\", that this \"tradition\" belonged to the revolutionaries - but the actual history of 1968 says different. The idea that May events were a bourgeois affair disapproved of by the working class has its roots in the French Communist party's anti-insurrectionary propaganda. The real story, of course, is that the student revolt, and the police's violent overreaction to it, sparked off a general strike in defiance of the party, church and unions.
