Dressed in dark wig, leather coat, fishnets and PVC, like a cross between Berg's Lulu and Madonna, Barbara Hannigan both sang and directed in a tour de force of performance and vocal brilliance. It was just as well that it finished the evening: nothing played afterwards could have lived up to it. Hannigan's first solo set consisted of three items by Mozart \u2013 the concert arias Vado, Ma Dove? and Misera, Dove Son? \u2013 plus Un Moto di Gioia, composed for a revival of The Marriage of Figaro. If Hannigan's vocal limitations were evident here \u2013 hers is a smallish soprano, with little surface sheen \u2013 the vivid imagination underpinning her expressive delivery was never in doubt. To Ryan Wigglesworth fell the conducting duties proper. He summoned up spry performances of Rossini's Silken Ladder and Il Signor Bruschino overtures, lacking nothing in characterful wit or dynamic momentum. Richard Watkins was the soloist in Weber's Horn Concertino, his tone distinguished in its refined mellowness; he even pulled off the unusual \"chords\" the composer asks for \u2013 one note played, the other hummed. It's a trick Ligeti might have used, though not in his Romanian Concerto, an attractive example of his early, folk-influenced style with a hell-for-leather finale the musicians entered into with thrilling conviction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
