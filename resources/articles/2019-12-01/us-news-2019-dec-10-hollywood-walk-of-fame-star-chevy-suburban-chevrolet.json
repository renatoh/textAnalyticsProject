The Hollywood Chamber of commerce, which administers the Walk of Fame, chose the car for its appearance in more than 1,750 movies and its appearance in a film for every year since 1960. Often featuring an all-black exterior and tinted windows, the Chevy Suburban has been featured prominently in films as the decoy car. Some of the models\u2019 standout film and TV credits include the 2004 action film John Wick, the 2006 horror movie The Hills Have Eyes, and throughout The Sopranos and The Walking Dead\u2019s television runs. \u201cThe Award of Excellence Star is a special recognition that the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce presents to celebrate corporations like Chevrolet,\u201d Rana Ghadban, president and CEO of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, told the Guardian. \u201cCompanies that have had a major impact on our economy \u2013 whether that\u2019s through job creation or their contributions to the community.\u201d Ghadban declined to comment when asked if Chevrolet had ever donated to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s relevant to your article,\u201d she said. When asked why the chamber selected Chevrolet, over other car brands and models with a noted presence in movies (for example: the Ford Mustang, which Ford claims has appeared in more than 4,500 films), Ghadban responded: \u201cOther companies may apply and be selected. This is the company we have chosen and selected this year, and we are very honored to have selected Chevrolet.\u201d Past recipients of the award of excellence star include Disneyland, the LA Times and the LA Dodgers baseball team. The Hollywood Walk of Fame continues to be a big tourist draw. Featuring more than 2,600 stars and sprawling 1.3 miles, it pays tribute to the biggest names in pop culture. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce first envisioned the Walk of Fame in 1953, going on to select recipients and construct the project over the following six years. The attraction draws more than 10 million visitors annually and was designated a historical-cultural monument by the state of California in 1978. In recent years, the Walk of Fame has been a site of protests over stars dedicated to controversial public figures, including Donald Trump and Bill Cosby. The Chamber of Commerce has not announced plans to remove Cosby or Trump\u2019s stars, despite continued vandalism and theft attempts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
