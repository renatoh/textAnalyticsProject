About 60% of adults are uncomfortable with the prospect although 48% of consumers would be encouraged to use a smart card if security was better then present levels. Analysts Mintel believe as many as 35 million smart cards could be in circulation by 2002. Their research involved interviewing 1,792 adults, with findings showing that 40% of those asked had never heard of smart cards. Graham Collett, financial consultant, said: \"The danger involved if a smart card could be hacked by criminal elements is probably the main concern.\" Nearly a third of 16-24-year-olds interviewed would be encouraged to use smart cards if they replaced cash. Over half of the respondents with some form of payment card agree that they would use it online if it were more secure. The Mintel report stated: \"For consumers, smart cards offer the potential to use their own cards with greater freedom from fraud. \"Channels such as the Internet and the telephone are likely to become more widely used if security was increased.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
