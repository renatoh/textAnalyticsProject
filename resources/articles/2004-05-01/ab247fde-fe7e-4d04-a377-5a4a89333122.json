Towers Perrin is an international firm that offers human resources and specialised professional services to employing organisations. It advises other firms on salaries, bonuses, share options, pensions and all the perks that make up a modern executive's reward package. The Tillinghast business of Towers Perrin provides actuarial and management consulting to insurance and financial services companies, and helps corporate clients deal with issues related to mergers and acquisitions. It is a wholly-owned partnership of senior employees called 'principals' with offices in 23 countries employing around 8,500 people. What does it want from me? It's after high-calibre, personable and well-motivated graduates with an intelligent and progressive attitude and a first or 2:1 plus good A-levels. More importantly, you'll need a fair amount of business acumen to understand its markets and lines of business. It's keen too on interpersonal awareness - your ability to notice, interpret, and anticipate others' concerns and feelings, and communicate this empathetically to them. But don't bother unless you have an ability to contribute to the whole team's success. What do I get in return? You will be given every encouragement to develop your career, both by formal training and involvement in a wide variety of client assignments. You will work closely with experienced consultants and will be encouraged to develop the skills which best suit your particular talents and ambitions. Actuarial graduate trainees work towards qualifying as a fellow of the Institute or Faculty of Actuaries. Human resources trainees are encouraged to develop a wide range of skills and get the relevant qualifications. But does it pay enough to zap my student loan? As it designs reward programs for leading companies, its employees tend to benefit from many of the most innovative types of packages. The company offers a total reward deal with competitive pay linked to individual performance and includes health care, pension plan, paid holidays, life insurance and disability protection. Any useful tips to impress the hiring squad? Towers Perrin started life in 1934. The world at the time was in the grip of depression, the stock markets were at an all-time low and employers wanted help in providing for an uncertain future facing their workforces. It has been in the UK since 1969 with Tillinghast becoming part of the Towers Perrin group in 1986. Towers Perrin's vast database contains up-to-date and reliable information to provide comparative market data to develop effective employee pay and benefits packages for top companies around the world.
